    <meta property="og:description" content="Subdomain takeover attacks are on the rise and they are becoming more prolific due to the decentralized approach to ops and embracement of SAAS services. In this talk we will introduce the problem, aimed at everyone from sysops gurus to absolute novices. We will then explain what an attacker can do and then finally how you can detect these conditions before the attacker and ideally before deployment! * What are subdomains takeover attacks and how is the adoption of DevOps ideologies increasing the risk of DNS misconfiguration? * What can an attacker do with a successfully hijacked domain? * How we can detect and defend DNS issues at scale"/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>Subdomain takeover attacks are on the rise and they are becoming more prolific due to the decentralized approach to ops and embracement of SAAS services.
In this talk we will introduce the problem, aimed at everyone from sysops gurus to absolute novices. We will then explain what an attacker can do and then finally how you can detect these conditions before the attacker and ideally before deployment!
* What are subdomains takeover attacks and how is the adoption of DevOps ideologies increasing the risk of DNS misconfiguration?
* What can an attacker do with a successfully hijacked domain?
* How we can detect and defend DNS issues at scale</p>

            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Simon Gurney is a co founder of punk Security. He will talk about subdomain hijacking attacks. Why should you be interested and why should you try and prevent it? What can you do to defend your organization?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                DNS starts with some routing servers. These are hard coded onto DNS servers. The job of the routine server is to point people when they're after a co UK subdomain at nominates co UK services. That's because maintaining these TLD servers is expensive.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In a home environment, you're just going to get served whatever your ISP is providing. Given an IP address, a computer can work out where on the planet it needs to get that data to. What we actually see in DNS is lots of layers of caching.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Subdomains are those parts of the subdomains that you control. Because those domains have got misconfiguration that is detectable we're going to services our own content from them. The GitHub pages takeover is a really quite simple one to get your head around.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Developers want to be able to manage their own DNS, particularly if you're using services like Netlify. What we see is NS delegation. It's very similar to what we saw before. DNS now is predominantly provided by SaaS services. If you were to break something, you could bring down all services.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Typically when we see NS takeover attacks it's because of things like terraform and copy and pasting. As DevOps, with developers being enabled in small focus teams, delegation is more rife than ever. How is DevOps making it worse?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                An attacker can either take over a particular domain or with the NS record, take over all the subdomains beneath it. This is perfectly possible attack. There are some mitigations. This isn't always possible.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 lucid scope cookies are loosely scoped. If an attacker takes over any single subdomain, then the session cookies of the user are going to flow that way. Just by having an image tag we can steal their session tokens. There's a lot of danger to lucidscope cookies when we talk about subdomain takeovers.

              <li>
                DNS Reaper can be used for DNS configuration or auditing. Can use it to scan for bounty. If it detects a detection, detects a takeover opportunity, you can then go nit that in the bud. Could be useful for risk conscious organizations.

                To celebrate our second birthday this year we're doing a devsecops theme, CTF. There'll be subdomain takeovers, attacks, they'll be abusing SaaS services, AWS, abusing access keys. If you can make it, that's may the fourth shameless plug.
