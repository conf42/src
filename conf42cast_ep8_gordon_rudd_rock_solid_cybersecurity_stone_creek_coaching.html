I appreciate you asking me to be on your podcast.", "speaker": "Gordon Rudd", "timestamp": "0:22  ", "timestamp_s": 22}, {"body": "Sure. Really excited for that. Very well is in short supply this day, so I\u0027ve got to take that and run with it. So this little tradition that we\u0027ve developed recently is that we start our guests with a word question. Your word question for today is: if you could have any animal at all, as a pet, what would it be?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "0:28  ", "timestamp_s": 28}, {"body": "It would be a dog. I find dogs are very friendly and lovable and they definitely will take care of you. And the thing that I like about a dog is they\u0027ll tell you the character of a person they meet instantly.

Alright, great. So now that we\u0027ve got that out of the way, the first thing that obviously strikes me when I was stalking you a little bit on LinkedIn preparing for this, is that there\u0027s a wealth of experience. Counting 35 years plus, there\u0027s been a lot of hats that you were wearing, right? I\u0027ve seen programmer, project leader, manager, director, manager partner, VPC, kind of all the things that you can think of. Can you tell me a little bit more about the different transitions? As much as you want to go into the personal one. But from my perspective, it\u0027s very interesting to see what made you do this. Was it just like a natural progression of things, or particular events that influenced that? Would you mind telling me a bit about that?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "1:19  ", "timestamp_s": 79}, {"body": "Sure. Well, I worked my way through college through University of Oklahoma as a Fortran programmer. Yeah, I got a job translating differential equations into Fortran statement. Yeah, that was a job in the day. Back in the day, that was a real thing. One of the professors in the college business, I was getting an undergraduate degree in finance, one of the professors in the College of Business, asked me one day after class: Why do I keep seeing you in the computer center? I told him, I was working for a math professor translating differential equations and the Fortran statements. And he asked me if I\u0027d come to work for him. And I just transitioned into doing decision theory models and communications protocols, and that sort of thing, for the agency that he worked for. Actually were working as subcontractors for the Department of the Navy to create these communication protocols. And then when I graduated college, it was kind of a natural segue to go to work in the defense industrial base, and work as a civilian contractor through the Department of Defense. And all the little three-letter agencies that are in there, you know, that kind of thing. And I did that for a long time. I was hanging around being a programmer. And one day the project manager quit. So the boss\u0027s boss called and said: \"Hey, we need you to be the project manager. We\u0027re just going to put your name in a box, and it\u0027s alright. Don\u0027t worry about it. You don\u0027t really have to do anything\". So I said, \"Okay, great\". So, next day, I go over to the construction trailer, where the project manager is supposed to be, and all these people show up. And they\u0027ve got all these projects going on all over the planet. And nobody really seemed to know what was going on. So I took an early copy, back in the day of Harvard project manager at IBM PC, and I organized all the projects and put them on a timeline and that sort of thing. And when my boss\u0027s boss saw that he\u0027s like, \"Well, you\u0027re a project manager, you\u0027re no longer worried about IT thing\". So I spent several years project managing pipelines, supervisory control and data acquisition systems or skated systems, automated energy management systems, that kind of thing. And I would just put the project together and the engineers and the engineers that design it, and I would stamp it out and away we go. And then, after several years of doing that, my mom found out she had cancer. So I moved back home to take care of mom. Had to get a job, ended up in healthcare. So you know, my friends always gave me a hard time, \"You spent 10 years with the defense industrial base blowing stuff up. And now you\u0027re working for a very large hospital, putting things back together\". It\u0027s like, \"Yeah, well, it\u0027s karma. It\u0027s just a karmic experience\". So I ended up in healthcare. Spent 10 years in healthcare. We were fortunate enough, while I was there, to create what was the number one telemedicine program on the planet at the time. So we actually treated more people in one month than all the telemedicine programs up to that time treated ever. So it was very successful. And then one of my, actually a former student of mine, recruited me to go to work for the Williams companies and Telsa. And I went to work for one of their organizations, actually designing their points of presence in their fiber optic network for Williams communication. And then another one of my students found out I was working there, and he recruited me to go to energy marketing and trading. So I stood up the technology support for the quantitative analytics group at Williams, and then ended up moving on through just a series of other adventures to banking and just kind of stuck with banking. I\u0027ve been either working on the backend with the technology of banks, or working in banks being chief information security officer, that kind of thing. And that seven, eight years ago, something like that, I started coaching people that wanted to get into information technology, or they wanted specifically to get into information security. And I found that there\u0027s a group of technology folks out there who don\u0027t realize why they\u0027re not C-level material. You can talk to him for a few minutes. And you can understand that they don\u0027t have the social skills, they don\u0027t have the emotional IQ, if you will, to be CISO. So I started working with them through a project I created called the \"CISO Mentoring Project\". And then as I got on in my career, I decided I wanted to make that a full-time job. So Stone Creek Coaching was born. And now that\u0027s what I do all day. And I help people that want to become C-level executives for either Chief Information Officer, Chief Technology Officer or Chief Information Security Officer, and I try to work with them and show them how to interact with people in such a way that they can be part of a team and they can actually be functional. And I hate to sound like some of them are broke. But some folks, when you talk to them, you just know that they\u0027re just not going to go as high as their ambitions going to want them to. Unless they make a change. And that\u0027s really what I\u0027m all about, is trying to find those folks that really want to get to the C-level. And just help them do it. You know, that kind of thing. I spend a little time talking to venture capital companies. For some reason, three or four years ago, a venture capital company started calling me and asking me about technologies and the direction technology was going, different vendors in the tech space thing. And I kind of enjoy that. Most of those conversations are very interesting. It\u0027s been a fun career. I\u0027ve just kind of gone really, to be honest with you, where my heart led me or where somebody said, \"Hey, you want to try this?\". And I said, \"Yeah, that\u0027ll be fun. Let\u0027s do that\", kind of thing. It wasn\u0027t really all planned out and mapped out. It was just more about: \"Well, yeah, that looks like fun. Let\u0027s do it.\"", "speaker": "Gordon Rudd", "timestamp": "2:14  ", "timestamp_s": 134}, {"body": "Well, love it. Some of the things to touch upon here, from asking you when was the last time you wrote any Fortran to, just kind of, one thing that you mentioned is that you can look at the person and see that they might not be a C-level material. But then, at the same time, you mentioned that they can develop the skills if they work on that. It sounds like it\u0027s a set of skills rather than necessarily some innate talent or something like that. Can anybody, with enough practice and enough work put in, get to the right level of the skills? Or do you need a blend of both to be successful?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "8:15  ", "timestamp_s": 495}, {"body": "Anybody in technology, as you guys know very well, you\u0027re in technology, you\u0027re a lifelong learner. If you don\u0027t love learning, you better get out of what you\u0027re doing. Because you won\u0027t be able to do it for long, the tech will advance. You won\u0027t staff breaks in the store. But when it comes to soft skills relating to people and things like that, a lot of introverted folks will spend their time with the computer, because the computer gives them instant feedback. And you know, if you\u0027re writing a program, whether it\u0027s Python or Go or whatever, you hit enter and then either runs or doesn\u0027t, then you go fix it. Well, that\u0027s great, except when you have to start dealing with the lines of business and the people that run those lines of business. And the end users. You know, we\u0027ve all worked in technology situations before where somebody had pop off in a meeting, \"If it wasn\u0027t for the damn users, we\u0027d have a great job\". And it\u0027s like, \"Well, you know, users are why we\u0027re here. That\u0027s why we exist. That\u0027s why they keep paying us money\". A lot of technical folks are so comfortable working with machines that they avoid working with people. Even if they get married and have children and have friends and that sort of thing, they still focus just exclusively on the tech and on that instant feedback, right and wrong, and they don\u0027t really pay enough attention to the soft skills and interacting with people. And if you can\u0027t interact with people, you\u0027re never going to build high performance teams. And you guys know, I mean, you do conferences all the time. You know that today in tech, high performance teams are the thing. Whether it\u0027s Kubernetes, AWS, whatever you\u0027re working in, your team has to perform at a peak level. But how do you create that team? How do you make those participants more than the sum of the parts? For instance, when I created the telemedicine program in St. Francis, I went to a meeting with the C-level folks, the CEO, CFO, all the C people were there. And the CEO said, \"Okay, get some people out of IT, create the department, get it go on. Give us telemedicine\". And I said, \"Well, we don\u0027t have those people. We don\u0027t have any technical people that do this\". And the chief financial officer, who everybody in IT reported up to at the time, was just really incensed. Leaning across the table and said, \"How can you say that we don\u0027t have people that will do that?\". I said, \"Well, they have to understand audio compression algorithms, video compression algorithms, how to marry them. They also need to understand something about working with people, because we\u0027re going to be working with real-life patients and real-life physicians.\", that kind of thing. And so they discussed it a little bit. And then they said, \"Well, see what you can do by picking out people. And we\u0027ll get everybody in the different subdepartments within IT to help you out\". Well, my colleagues\u0027 idea of helping out was to offer up their weakest players. Or people they didn\u0027t want to put up with anyone. And so what I did was, to take those folks and put them together as a team, and get them to perform at a higher level than anybody else in the hospital. So much so, that when anything broke, everybody else in hospital would come to a member of my team and say, \"Can you help me fix this?\". Well, it\u0027s kind of strange that in the space of a year, they can go from being people that nobody wanted on their team, to being the \"go-to\" team in that whole hospital with over 7000 employees. So, I would say that paying attention to the soft skills and being able to work as a team and be a team player, and understand that and motivate individuals to perform at a higher level. I think it\u0027s a set of skills, to your earlier point, that you have to learn. You have to be able to read people, you have to be able to emote with people, you know, a lack of empathy. You\u0027ve all met people that have no empathy whatsoever, and you don\u0027t really want to hang around with them. That\u0027s kind of the thing that it hinges on. Do you care about the people on your team? Do you know the names of their significant others and their children and their dogs and their cats, goldfish or whatever? Are you close enough to them to understand what motivates them, and what demotivates them. And then figure out exactly what you need to do to get your projects done and move it along at a higher level. That\u0027s really what it\u0027s all about. It\u0027s just getting the team to buy into what\u0027s going on. Look at a more specific example. Look at what Tom Brady did for the Buccaneers last year. Just go back to football, he went in, kind of reorganize the thought patterns and the way that everybody related and started communicating at a very high level. He didn\u0027t just communicate with people on offense, he communicated with everybody that would listen. And what he did, was to bring together a team of people that probably would have finished middle of the pack. And instead, they ended up winning the Super Bowl. And it wasn\u0027t even close. By the end of the season, they were the killer team in the league. And that\u0027s really what you want to do. You want to be able to bring these people along, communicate with them. Make sure everybody understands where you are, what your objectives are. And then just get out of their way. Let them go. Because once you empower people, they tend to take off and just sore on their own. Does that make sense? ", "speaker": "Gordon Rudd", "timestamp": "8:55  ", "timestamp_s": 535}, {"body": "It does. And it really lands very close to home. I myself made the transition couple of years ago from being a tech leader to trying to help the team performing. And like you said, this kind of instant response that you get from tech, it works or it doesn\u0027t. Or satisfies or passes the test or doesn\u0027t. And then all of a sudden you\u0027re in this sea of feelings and things that are hard to measure. Performance itself of a team, it\u0027s not that easy to measure by itself. And I think that a lot of the points you touched upon, it kind of realize quickly that it\u0027s more about being like a coach and physically, making sure that the team feels good. Human beings, they enjoy hanging out together. It\u0027s probably one of the most important and difficult things at the same time.", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "14:15  ", "timestamp_s": 855}, {"body": "Every time you have a World Cup, it\u0027s not necessarily the most talented team that wins. But it\u0027s the group that plays together as a unit, so that the coach and everybody on that soccer team plays together as a team. They function very well together and they go from a lot of games they probably should have won to winning those games, and then exceeding expectations. And then the next thing you know, they catch fire, and they\u0027re in a World Cup final simply, because they all started working together as a unit, and stop being the individuals out there all trying to run around and score. To me, that was always the kind of the funny thing about soccer, everybody can score. Let\u0027s just all go score. It was a little different. But I think it\u0027s very much the same thing. It happens. We see it in sports all the time. Why can\u0027t we see that in the workplace? Why can\u0027t we see it in technology? Well, it\u0027s because we don\u0027t teach those skills, we don\u0027t stop and say, \"How can we make this individual the leader of a high performance team? What can we give him or her, from a skill set point of view, that will make them successful?\". It\u0027s actually not that hard, once you understand that. It\u0027s just getting the people to believe in it. I work with people all the time that will say things like, \"Well, I can\u0027t do this, because bla bla bla bla bla\". And when you listen to it, it\u0027s just like, if we could record this and play it back to you, you probably would never say that again. It doesn\u0027t make any sense. And maybe there\u0027s a better way to communicate that, that kind of thing. We\u0027ve all been on the phone with helpdesk people that we know didn\u0027t want to be there. Crazy things, basically just to get you to hang up and try and get somebody else. Those types of things are just part of learning to deal with people.", "speaker": "Gordon Rudd", "timestamp": "15:11  ", "timestamp_s": 911}, {"body": "And I can see, from the examples you choose to describe that, why you would transition into this coaching and getting the satisfaction and the scale of the impact that you can make is higher. Was that the primary driver for you to start the business?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "17:09  ", "timestamp_s": 1029}, {"body": "Well, it was. I\u0027ve always had a different way of looking at work and looking at the people that are in it, and looking at the corporate culture that surrounds it, than most people. I really have, over the years, become a student of corporate culture. And you can see a lot of corporate cultures that start out really strong, and then go wonky. And all of us that, that\u0027s a technical term: \"wonky\". That kind of just go south on everybody, and it just doesn\u0027t work. And it\u0027s unfair to the people. It\u0027s unfair to the folks that are in these jobs. And then lately, I\u0027ve guess lately, over the last 10 years, I\u0027ve seen technical people spend less and less time trying to put a good job description into HR, for whatever reason. Whether or not their boss won\u0027t approve it. The management team doesn\u0027t think you need another one of those, let\u0027s say, server administrator, but they think you\u0027ll need another security analyst. So you get a job description for a security analyst going to HR, and they\u0027re kicking out everybody that\u0027s in security. And they\u0027re saying, \"We really want to Server Admin, that\u0027s really what we\u0027re looking for. Give me somebody that says they\u0027re a Server Admin\", kind of thing. So we\u0027ve got this disconnect in corporate America or corporations around the world for that matter. In fact, a lot of the people I work with are in the UK, France, significant number of people in France. Not that the French are broken by any means. I do work in France, South Africa, Australia, this is really a global problem. It\u0027s not just something that\u0027s indicative to America, or just the North American continent. We have to spend more time working with our HR partners to get better job description. So on the other hand, we can get better candidates so that we can find the right skill set, and put those folks in a position where they can thrive. They can survive, they can thrive, and they can be happy. It\u0027s one of those things that we all want to be happy in our job. We all want a high level of job satisfaction. But that job satisfaction is really what everybody\u0027s looking for in that high level of job satisfaction. And the only way we can get that is by working together as people to solve problems, and by being a better corporate structure to fit into. And that\u0027s really kind of interesting when you stop and think about it, that the corporate culture is going to really set the tone for everybody in it. And they\u0027re going to ignore the technology people. And no disrespect to HR or anybody else. But the old saying, \"Let\u0027s shut down HR for a week and see if anybody notices. And let\u0027s turn off IT for an hour and see who gets fired\". That\u0027s kind of a thing that\u0027s always going on in organizations. We can\u0027t live without the tech anymore. But we have not figured out the care and feeding of the people that are technologists, that work in it. We haven\u0027t really stopped and taken a look at the individuals and their jobs and what they do for a living, so that we can make sense of it. If you look at a Server Admin. If you and I are a Server Admin, and we\u0027re doing the normal Server Admin thing, we can take care of 17/18 servers if they\u0027re individual units. Or maybe 27, if we\u0027ve got them racked up. At Google, the metric they use, is every Server Admin has 10,000 servers to take care of. Well, that\u0027s because they\u0027ve got the tools to do it. They\u0027ve developed those tools. And just like developing those kinds of technology tools, we need to develop the human capital, we need to develop the human tools to drive it. And that\u0027s really the thing that got me into coaching. I keep seeing this mismatch. You can read job descriptions on any platform you choose. And you look at job descriptions and you say that, \"Yeah, I wish I could find that person, because they can do absolutely everything in technology. There\u0027s nothing that person can\u0027t do\". There\u0027s no job on the planet. Even if your hands on one person that\u0027s running the ID shop, there\u0027s nobody that\u0027s going to have all those skills, there\u0027s just no way. So why did that even make it into a LinkedIn or an Indeed, or one of the big boards? Why did that even make it out into the wild? What\u0027s wrong with that job description? Now, is the person that gets that job going to be happy in it? Well, maybe if we happen to get lucky and match somebody to stay with the Server Admin. If we happen to find somebody that\u0027s willing to do a server admin role, that\u0027s really what we need, then we\u0027re gonna do it. Most of the time, what happens is the people looking at it from outside that want to apply for that job, are going to read the job description, and are going to want to try and fit into it. And a lot of what I coach is, if you see a bad job description, it\u0027s probably not a good organization, or somebody is not spending a lot of time on it. So you might want to do a little more homework and find out more about that company, find out more about that job to make sure that you know exactly what\u0027s going to happen when you hit the ground. Because that\u0027s really the thing. I don\u0027t know if you guys have ever done it, but I\u0027ve actually gone to the job before and on day one, they basically told me that everything I thought about the job was wrong. And I was going to do something different. That\u0027s like, \"Okay\". I\u0027m not sure what you think of that. But I don\u0027t think much of that. It\u0027s kind of like, okay, we just got bid on a bait and switch.", "speaker": "Gordon Rudd", "timestamp": "17:28  ", "timestamp_s": 1048}, {"body": "Yeah, exactly. Bait and switch. That\u0027s the technical term for that. I\u0027m curious about what the process looks like. How does one become your padawan and then eventually gets the blessing go forth and be C-level? Because a lot of the things that you mentioned, they are tricky in the respect that they make sense. It\u0027s kind of the things that everybody will agree if you tell them that. But then, when the proverbial rubber hits the proverbial road, that\u0027s where things get tricky. So how do you like really help people with the soft skills? I understand that the prerequisite is that they want to change and they want to see that. But I expect this is very different process from what we\u0027re all used to in learning technical skills. Can you tell tell me a bit more about the process? Unless that\u0027s obviously your secret sauce...", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "23:08  ", "timestamp_s": 1388}, {"body": "It\u0027s not really a secret sauce. It\u0027s just really simple. The thing that I always do, and the framework that I\u0027ve created, that I use, is simply starting off by getting their head right. By saying, \"Why are you here? Why are you doing what you\u0027re doing? Are you happy doing it? What\u0027s good about it, what\u0027s bad about it?\". And then a lot of times what I\u0027ll do after we have a series of conversations about who they are right now, and what their aspirations are, where they want to grow into, why are they asking me to coach them, that kind of thing. I may give them a skills inventory, like the Myers Briggs or True Colors, or one of those that will actually divide personality types up into basically four buckets, kind of thing, and let them see themselves. So if you\u0027re looking at these personality traits, if you\u0027re doing Myers Briggs, and they\u0027re giving you IJENS. What does that mean? It helps the individual to say, \"Okay, I am introverted. I\u0027m really not going to be the person in a social situation that\u0027s going to be walking around talking to people at a party, I\u0027m the one that\u0027s going to be standing in the corner\". Once we get the individual to get their mind right and understand who they really are. And understand what their triggers are, everybody has triggers. I\u0027ve got triggers you\u0027ve got triggers, Mark has triggers. There are certain things you know you can say to Mark, they\u0027re gonna light him up. And it works the other way around too. Especially with your all\u0027s relationship, then that sort of things true. Well, if you can recognize those in yourself, then you can take the intellectual leap at first before you can actually do it. And say, \"I see where this is going, I understand how I feel. And I know where that normally would lead. So I\u0027m going to choose to feel differently about that this time\". And then you start making a series of decisions, you can\u0027t control the decision you\u0027ve already made. Those decisions that are in the past, they\u0027re gone. You can only control the next one. So the next time that happens, you\u0027ve got to make the intellectual decision, \"Okay, I\u0027m not going to go off on him. I\u0027m not going to say that, because that Institute\u0027s three or four different exchanges, that always end up in us not talking for a while, saying evil things about each other\". Just like siblings normally do. But we\u0027ve all got those triggers, and we carry them into corporate America with us. So you can sit in the meeting, and you can be fine. And then somebody will say something, and just the wrong way, all of a sudden, your blood pressure\u0027s going up and your cheeks are turning red. Now you can keep from killing that individual. I want to strangle him or her. Well, if you don\u0027t understand that, and you don\u0027t understand that cue, you\u0027re very likely to just pop off and say something that\u0027s inappropriate. And it\u0027s at that point that your capital within the corporation starts to decrease, and they start to see you as a technology person. Humans, as you pointed out, our group behavior people. We want to be in groups, we want to be in tribes. But when you look at the C-level people as a tribe, to get into that tribe, they\u0027re going to have to do some normal things that we all do. They\u0027re going to have to say, \"Do you fit in this group? Would I get along with you, if you were in this group? Would I enjoy working with you?\". Well, if the answer to any one of those questions is: \"I don\u0027t think so. That person\u0027s real hell on wheels, I don\u0027t want to deal with them\". Well, you\u0027re never going to get in C-level at that organization. And if you hide behind the technology constantly, and you fail to get out in front of people, you fail to be able to communicate your message, you\u0027re going to have a problem. Think about it, you\u0027re very good at expressing yourself. You can take an idea, you can write it, you can communicate it in writing, or you can do what you\u0027re doing and communicate it by speaking to people. That\u0027s a skill. Not every technologist has that skill. Most of them, if you stood them up in front of a group of other technologists and said, \"Give me a presentation on DNS\". They\u0027d be like, \"I\u0027m not doing a presentation. Well, you know, DNS, right? Yeah, I know, DNS inside and out. I\u0027ve got it. I\u0027ve even got three certs that say I know DNS. So why can\u0027t you give the presentation? I can\u0027t talk in front of people\". That\u0027s something we got to get over, if we\u0027re going to be at the C-leve. Because they\u0027re going to expect you to not only chat with them, but to present to the board and present outside the organization. So it\u0027s those kinds of skills that we can teach the individual to help them fit in better. Help them make better decisions so that they\u0027re doing things a little different. And I\u0027ve found that once a technologist wakes up, if you\u0027ll forgive the analogy, wakes up to the fact that how they act and how they behave, affects more than just them. Then all of a sudden, they start making different technology decisions. I don\u0027t necessarily mean that they\u0027re making better decisions, or that there\u0027s some magic in it. What I mean is, they\u0027re starting to make decisions that are based on the organization and the people in it, instead of just how well the tech works together. You guys all know, everybody is listening to this, I\u0027m sure you know, people that will bolt together a bunch of technology because it seems to fit together, the tech works together. And it\u0027s really great. But the end users are suffering because it\u0027s not that user-friendly. You watch these people as they grow and develop making different technology decisions. They\u0027re starting to think about people differently. They\u0027re starting to think about their organization and their role within the organization differently. And it\u0027s at that point, that you change the corporate culture, that you get a more positive corporate culture and you stop getting the silos. You don\u0027t necessarily eliminate them, but you certainly start breaking down the walls between the different departments. So that you\u0027re not going to have IT being a standalone silo, and nobody gets to go visit them without a hall pass. You\u0027ve all been in organizations out there, but you can\u0027t even get into the IT people to see them. They\u0027re behind some locked door. Well, that doesn\u0027t do anybody I hope. You need to be able to consider and be part of the organization.", "speaker": "Gordon Rudd", "timestamp": "24:06  ", "timestamp_s": 1446}, {"body": "Definitely. I\u0027m sorry, I was laughing at the DNS, because one of my favorite Haiku is about DNS. It goes like this: \"It\u0027s not DNS. It can\u0027t possibly be DNS. It was DNS\". Brings so many memories. Yeah, there\u0027s so much I can relate to, what you just said. As you were talking about us realizing that in the context of where we are right now, you know, in the middle, well, hopefully towards the end now, but in a pandemic, where a lot of this interactions went online. And sure, we have video conferences now. And it\u0027s probably easier than it was in the past. But it\u0027s still tricky. And I\u0027m wondering, how do you see this affecting people\u0027s soft skills? And do you think that\u0027s going to have like a long lasting effect, in general, on how teams will cooperate and interact?", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "30:21  ", "timestamp_s": 1821}, {"body": "I believe it will. But I\u0027m not necessarily sure that it\u0027s going to be what we think. The organization that I just came out of, we all had laptops, and when we all got sent home, it wasn\u0027t a big deal, because everybody had a laptop. Because from time to time, the ladies that had children or the men that had families would take their turn staying home with a sick kid, or they\u0027d be going to a ballgame, out of state or something. But they would all be able to log in and do something and take care of business. So it wasn\u0027t a big deal. But as an organization, we weren\u0027t using video. There were so many people that were using zoom and teams and just using it for an audio connection and let it go. So the CEO decided, \"Hey, we\u0027re video-forward, we\u0027re always going to turn on our video\". And a couple weeks later, I seriously thought about sending an email and say, \"The corollary to that would have been to stop wearing sweatshirts and T-shirts, and crappy clothing, when you\u0027re on these video calls, especially with clients! Put on a shirt with a collar for the love of God. Get your act together\". Podcasting is its own thing. But if I\u0027m dealing with a client, and I\u0027m sitting there as a representative of an organization that I don\u0027t see in myself a responsibility to put my best self forward or to understand what being video-forward means. What good am I? Might be a guy that if you see his picture, like we can see your brother right now. That little icon thing that we give each other when we don\u0027t want to be seen. You see that the guy\u0027s got a suit and tie, he shaved, he\u0027s got a haircut. You see him in real life, he\u0027s got a beard that scraggly and hair tied back. He\u0027s got everything going on,. It looks like he\u0027s been in a cave for five years, you know? And it\u0027s like, why would you want to do that? You know, why wouldn\u0027t you want to put your best foot forward? And it\u0027s just those realizations that we don\u0027t take the time to tie up within an organization. Now you can tell that I\u0027m older and have a more classic sense about this, obviously. But we should take the time to explain to, especially, to the younger ones, why it\u0027s important to wear a shirt with a collar. Why it\u0027s important to do these things. And no, I\u0027m not talking about you, you can edit yourself to look like whatever you want.", "speaker": "Gordon Rudd", "timestamp": "31:22  ", "timestamp_s": 1882}, {"body": "We\u0027ll fix it in post.", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "33:52  ", "timestamp_s": 2032}, {"body": "Post, there you go. But doing things like that will help us, I think, to become closer because there\u0027s a certain respect in it. On the other hand, we\u0027ve all been on these calls where we got to know the people\u0027s kids. I worked with a lady that had four kids, her husband and her working from home. So there was always a kid and there was two or three dogs. So there was always a dog, and a kid and maybe a cat from time to time. Every time we\u0027d have a video conference, these things would be going on. And people would have their grandkids and that sort of thing. So from that perspective, we really got to see into people\u0027s homes, we got to see into their lives. We got to know them on a much deeper level. So part of that bonding, you\u0027re never going to be able to replace in the office, because everybody shows up and puts on a mask and plays the role that they\u0027re supposed to play in the office. We get them at home with four kids running around and two dogs and whatever and you get to see the real person, you get to know the real human that\u0027s been on the other side of that video. Which is good, because then you understand why she\u0027s always in a T-shirt, or why she\u0027s always in a sweatshirt and why they\u0027re doing these things. I remember one day being on the call with the same lady. And she said, \"Just give me two minutes, I got to go change my shirt. The baby just threw up on me\". And she comes back and sits down like two minutes later. And she says, \"That\u0027s the fourth time I\u0027ve had to do that this morning\". I get that. And that\u0027s a humanizing thing. But that\u0027s not something you\u0027d want to do with a client. That\u0027s something that you do with your co-workers to get to know each other better. And that\u0027s really what it\u0027s all about, is just trying to get to know each other better. Because look, cybersecurity, we\u0027re all a very small family. So we should all be able to band together and make some changes. We should all be able to help our HR department come up with better job descriptions. We should all be able to institute programs within our corporations to help the individuals become, not only better people, but better employees, and work with them on their pain points. We all have those pain points that, we\u0027d really like to eliminate. And that\u0027s the kind of thing that I really like to help organizations with, is to see where things that they might think are great in their corporate culture might not be as great as they think. Give you a specific example. How many organizations do you know today that still have the big blowout Christmas parties? I mean, the big organizations used to rent out a hotel, and they\u0027d have these giant, blowout Christmas parties with an open bar and all the orders and dinner and entertainment and all this sort of thing. They do that all the time. Well, they don\u0027t do that anymore. Well, what are they doing to replace it? How are they helping their people to interact? The people that I work with in Europe, when they take a holiday, they go away for a month or two. I mean, that\u0027s a holiday to them. To us, that\u0027s being laid off. That\u0027s different. So, you guys in Europe have a totally different philosophy. I think, a lot of times, it\u0027s much better philosophy, in my humble opinion, about trying to get to know your co-workers. I used to work with an organization that had some consultants and from SAP. Those guys literally got together every Friday afternoon. They shut all the work down, and they get together and do a little wine and cheese thing, get to know each other and then go home to their families. There was more work that got done in the three hours that we spent together on Friday afternoon, then practically the rest of the week. Because everybody stopped playing a worker row and start playing that human interaction game where, okay, what can I do to help you? How can I help you? And one of the things that I did out of that, that I actually just stole it from the guy that was in charge of consulting assignment there at that organization. He used to do this thing on Monday morning that he referred to as \"calendaring up\" and he\u0027d get the whole team around the table. And all we do is you\u0027d go around the table, and just ask what\u0027s on your calendar for the next week? And what would happen is, you know, we\u0027d go along, two or three people would say something, then somebody would say, \"I\u0027m going to install a new router\". And somebody across the table say, \"No, you\u0027re not. You can\u0027t install a router until I do this\". It was basically taking everything. And I don\u0027t think this was an accident, because he was taking everything, all the human capital that he\u0027d built up with the wine and cheese parties on Friday, and then the first thing Monday morning, he was having the same team plan out their week. So they did it as a team. He rarely, if ever, gave any direction. It was just like, what\u0027s on your calendar? What are you going to be doing this week? And whatever you said you were going to be doing is okay, unless somebody needed you to do something else. And it forced you to be a part of the team. It also forced you to change your priorities to help a teammate. Think about the difference in that particular philosophy. And I don\u0027t know if it was the individuals or if it was a corporate philosophy or what, but that gentleman and his particular philosophy, is so much sounder and so much more productive than, just \"Okay, we got to get it done by Thursday\". Never been a fan of \"got to get it done by Thursday\". ", "speaker": "Gordon Rudd", "timestamp": "33:54  ", "timestamp_s": 2034}, {"body": "I can really relate to the aspect of humanizing your colleagues and this, kind of, unexpected aspect of actually seeing a little insight through the computer window to how people are doing. And I know I\u0027m guilty of wearing tracksuits and what feels like five years in my cave right now. So, I can relate to that too. And especially for my friends who actually have small kids and have to take care of them. Especially during the period when there was no daycare or anything. I\u0027m really in awe of how they were able to find time for all of them. And, at the same time, remain productive. And that really gave us all opportunity to support each other on a different level. And it\u0027s weird. In many ways I feel starved of the social interaction. Just be able to walk on to someone rather than having to start a video call. At the same time, I feel like I met people in a different way, too. So yeah, definitely can relate to the aspects of what you were saying. I\u0027m gonna take us a little bit on a different track now. I want to make sure that we talk a little bit about the cyber security. Since I\u0027ve got you and for everybody who listens on to that there\u0027s a session by Gordon called \"Scalable, Sustainable Cybersecurity for Any Size Organization\" at the Conf42 Python. So, I guess we\u0027ll touch a little bit on that, too. But before we even get into that, how would you define cyber security in general? Because, before I met some friends in cybersecurity, it always looked to me like this magic. And you know, if you watch Hollywood movies, obviously, they just \"do doo doo doo doo doo\" on the keyboard and things magically happen. And then it\u0027s kind of disappointing to learn that outage or that hacked actually was because someone could take selfie, they didn\u0027t need to. Or because the default settings were public and you could actually download all the data from S3. And that was a problem. How would you define cyber security? And I\u0027m sure you have plenty of great anecdotes. So, if you could give us one or two to illustrate what it means in practice, that would be great.", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "39:21  ", "timestamp_s": 2361}, {"body": "I came into cybersecurity out of IT. So I had, when I first started, a traditional IT view of it. While I was at the Williams companies, I got the assignment to be one of the top two or three people in cybersecurity and actually help them stand up the cyber security organization, the information security kind of thing. And there is a bit of a difference in information security and cybersecurity. Information security includes everything spoken, written, that sort of thing. Cybersecurity, is basically what\u0027s happening on the wire, what\u0027s happening on the internet, what\u0027s happening on your network, as it were. But in starting out that way, literally, the first day, I\u0027m on the job that\u0027s really security at Williams, I get a call from the IBM at nine o\u0027clock in the morning. And the agent on the other end of the phone says, \"Hey, you guys are selling the Harry Potter movie that just opened in Frankfurt, Germany, across your network. And worse than that, you\u0027re sending it from your network to the IBM network\", which made some sense, given the proximity those offices in city we were in. And I was like, \"No kidding, really?\". And he\u0027s like, \"Yeah, you might want to look into that and see if you can fix it\". Well, the FBI, they have for the longest time had some serious cyber talent. So I\u0027m sitting there, trying to just hung up. Hadn\u0027t been 30 seconds, I\u0027m trying to figure out who to call first, my boss? Who am I going to tell this to? How am I going to solve this problem? When I get a call and on the caller ID it says \"IBM\", and I\u0027m like, \"Oh, this might be good\". So I pick up the phone and sure enough, it\u0027s IBM, you guys are traffic going across our network, you traffic in 45 megabits. And you got to remember this is in the early 00s. So 45 megabits was probably about half the bandwidth of that IBM office. You\u0027re traveling 45 megabits across our network, and it\u0027s the Harry Potter movie that\u0027s just been released. So we drill down on it and we find that because we have a big internet pipe, there is literally a data entry person who\u0027s entering invoices in the basement of the building where we were in, that thought kozar was a great idea and put it on his laptop. And because of our bandwidth, because all nominated him a super server. So he was serving the entire world soft. Now we\u0027ve just gone through the thing, not the year before, where we had our own server that had a bunch of songs on it and we\u0027d gotten the letter from the digital rights management people that said, \"You know, you got to quit that, or we\u0027re gonna fine you $100,000 for every song\". But since there were over 100,000 songs on that server, one of our vice presidents and our general counsel suggested that we give that up, stop doing that. We hadn\u0027t been doing that thing in a year, but apparently others in the organization didn\u0027t get the memo. So we spent probably the next 10-12 hours trying to find where that Harry Potter movie was coming from. And we did manage to find a couple of DVDs of pornography on a file server in Houston, Texas. That was is being used to actually transfer blueprints back and forth between architects and construction companies that we maintain. Because we\u0027re building pipelines and doing rightaway work and all that sort of thing. It was really kind of amazing to me, we could find that and we could turn that off. But whoever was trafficking Harry Potter had a set of skills that we hadn\u0027t seen. And this is, again, back in like, 2001, early 2001. So I started looking into why don\u0027t we have the skills. Because I think these guys are extraordinarily talented, and a lot of them were. But they really hadn\u0027t focused on cybersecurity, they hadn\u0027t focused on what would a bad actor want to do? What would a bad person want to do here? What would a thief do? That old thing of \"it takes a thief to catch a thief\" is probably kind of true. It\u0027s just like DNS is never the problem. And it always ends up being the problem, kind of thing. If you can figure out what the bad actor is really trying to accomplish, then you can make the organization more secure. So as I took off in cybersecurity in my career from that point, I started trying to make sure that I was always looking at the skill set of players. You can find some serious, serious talent in the hacking community. That\u0027s the thing I love about DEF CON. Well, especially DEF CON, but black hat and DEF CON kind of thing. There\u0027s some serious engineering talent there. They don\u0027t just break things because they like breaking them, which yeah, they do, by the way. But they do break things so that they can show the people that are building them where those flaws are, so that the bad actors can\u0027t shut down a pipeline. Now if you fast forward, we\u0027ve gotten to a point where we had Stuxnet, however you pronounce, that come out there and was built for the specific reason of shutting down power plants. So we can take a nuclear power plant or an electric generation station, and we can melt them down. If we use this software in the right way. Well, then what happens if somebody bad gets ahold of it? What if it\u0027s no longer just one of those things that\u0027s a theoretical thing that we could do with it. But somebody weaponizes it. And then what are they going to do with it? And right now, we\u0027ve got like three layers of things going on. We\u0027ve got the standard script kiddies, the kids in their mom\u0027s basement doing things, and some of them are in their 30s now. We\u0027ve got script kiddies in the basement doing their thing. And then we\u0027ve got guys and gals that are doing hacking for a living. And one of the most fun things you can do is when you get one of those calls, that you know is trying to sell you an extended warranty on your car, or some other bizarre call. The latest one I got said they were from the FBI kind of thing. I always want to talk to those people, I love to talk to them. Because once you get on to a person, if you listen closely, you can hear other people in the background, you\u0027re talking to a call center. So the bad actors have operationalize the things they know make them a little money. So we\u0027ve got romance scams coming out, we\u0027ve got spam email coming out, we\u0027ve got all these things that are designed to give the bad actor access to your money. And that\u0027s really all they want. They don\u0027t care about you, they just want your money. Anybody can take an identity and prop up a new identity and put some credentials with it that are serious. But getting money out of the bank account and moving it on down the line to a bank where you can take the cash out: that\u0027s a set of skills that require a lot of people and a lot of work. And how do you interrupt that. It\u0027s like a supply chain. Then we have cyber security professionals look at interrupting that supply chain. And then the third level are those people out there that we may never know, that nation states that have all the money and all the resources. When they become involved, there\u0027s a level of excellence that\u0027s kind of like going from Windows 95, to the latest version of Linux. They are so much further ahead of where everybody else is. It\u0027s unbelievable. Because they understand the value of training, they understand the value of spending money on top quality assets, that kind of thing. I\u0027m not worried about the guy that\u0027s going to go to Las Vegas and rent the Ferrari and rent out a villa and be all showy about it, because that person is going to get caught. I\u0027m worried about the guy that\u0027s driving around in a Subaru or a minivan and isn\u0027t really doing anything other than being a stay at home dad or a soccer mom that has a set of skills that will allow them to do things that other people may not totally understand. And they are also, almost every time, those same people are going to have social skills to the point that they can reorganize the way you think in such a manner that they can get you to click on something or take an action that\u0027s going to give them access to something that they shouldn\u0027t have. And it\u0027s at that point that you have to wonder, why am I doing this? These people are so much, they\u0027re functioning at such a higher level than we are. The bank I worked at, for instance, had something on the order of five or six hundred million bad things that would go by the firewall, and you could watch it. Okay, that\u0027s a botnet that\u0027s searching that somebody\u0027s trying to map the network. That somebody\u0027s trying to geo locate us, you know, and on and on and on. It\u0027d be impossible today to stop all that. So what we have to do, as cybersecurity professionals, is figure out how we can make cybersecurity that team sport that we keep talking about. How we can make sure that the entire organization is involved, all the way from the chairman of the board to the janitor. Everybody\u0027s got to be involved in it, because at every step, there\u0027s an opportunity for a compromise. And that\u0027s what we\u0027re trying to do is take those compromises away, so that if a bad actor does do something untoward, we\u0027ve at least got a heads up and we can say, \"Let\u0027s turn that network segment off. Let\u0027s kill that core, let\u0027s take some action\". And then we\u0027d like to practice it, as cyber professionals, so that we want to reach out and turn Mark off so that he can\u0027t do any further harm. We can just say, \"Okay, let\u0027s kill that now\". And we can reach out, turn him off, and not let him continue the activity that that he\u0027s into. And those kinds of things are really where we\u0027re going. We\u0027re getting to a point that we\u0027ve got to have every single person at least aware of the current pain point. So our threat feeds, our vulnerability assessments in our patch management programs have to interact together in a way that makes sense for us all. I think we\u0027re just kind of waking up to that. You know, I can\u0027t tell you how many organizations don\u0027t have threat intelligence, but they have scans and network and do know all the assets on their network. Okay, if you don\u0027t have threat intelligence, formal threat intelligence, not just one person that\u0027s looking on the internet every morning over coffee, you really do have threat intelligence, what\u0027s relative? Well, it\u0027s relative, it\u0027s on your network. So if you\u0027ve got your assets identified, it\u0027s relevant. And then if you know where your are in your patches, you can tell whether or not it\u0027s relative. Let\u0027s take Spectre and Meltdown. Those two came out, it made a big splash, I have to go talk to the board. And the board\u0027s asking, \"Well, okay, we\u0027ve identified the threat. We know we\u0027re vulnerable, because we have all this information you\u0027ve just given us. So what are we going to do about it?\". And I\u0027m stuck saying: \"Nothing\". Right now, the patch that Microsoft gives us in our test servers, makes the applications run so slow, they don\u0027t appear to be running at all. So it in effect, breaks everything. So we can patch it, but it\u0027ll break everything. Of course, the people on board are just, \"Oh, we don\u0027t want to do that. That might be bad\". Well, yeah. Turn off IT for an hour and see who gets fired. Come back to that. So you\u0027ve got to be able to take this intelligence and disseminate it further than ever. It\u0027s got to go to more people, it\u0027s got to go up the chain and down the chain, so that the people on the lines of business understand that Spectre and Meltdown probably aren\u0027t a bad thing. Because we\u0027ve got the perimeter secure and this is how we\u0027ve secured it. They\u0027ve got to understand the overlapping layers of security enough so that if we do miss something, and we\u0027ve got to listen too, that\u0027s the other thing. We\u0027ve got to listen, if somebody does come up from inside the organization and say, \"Hey, what about this?\". We don\u0027t just dismiss them out of hand, because they\u0027re not part of the security team. We actually listen to them and say, \"Well, what if that\u0027s a real deal? What if we do have a hole there? What if this person has found something?\"", "speaker": "Gordon Rudd", "timestamp": "41:43  ", "timestamp_s": 2503}, {"body": "Yeah, I got to say like the hardware problems, that was a real kind of eye-opener for myself. Because for such a long time, we just kind of assumed that there was no real servers for attack. And then \"Boom!\", all of a sudden turns out wrong. And there probably will be more. And another thing that, in the recent weeks, we obviously had the colonial pipeline ransomware attack. And when you were talking about individuals having the skills that are just kind of above what every gear person suspects, I also realized, with the work of the journalists around that, that it\u0027s actually a pretty big industry right now, the ransomware stuff. And I was pretty surprised to discover that the group that did the ransom thing to actually outsource to another group installing the ransomware, and they were very public about that. And then you have this group of people and they publish statements, make a public company or something. And it looks like it\u0027s no longer these individuals proving something from the basement. It\u0027s just a business like any other and there are some pretty scary statistics about how many companies actually pay this ransoms, because they have no real other option. So do you see this kind of on the rise, just because of the overall number of systems growing. And, by definition, the system\u0027s always been behind the exploits that you can just google on the internet and someone can use that. Is that by definition a losing battle that we have with cybersecurity, that we always have these systems that will be vulnerable.", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "53:48  ", "timestamp_s": 3228}, {"body": "That\u0027s true. The average bad actor is on your network for over 270 days. Well, depending on who you listen to. Some people say 260, some 280, but let\u0027s split it there, on your network for 270 days before they actually do anything bad. They\u0027re watching and mapping and escalating privileges and, and walking themselves up to a point that they can do what they want to do kind of thing. It\u0027s unfortunate, but you\u0027re right, the bad actors are going to be able to attract more people to their side of it. Because in a worst case scenario, you may steal 10 or $15 million, and you may end up in jail for three years, or five years, if you\u0027ve stolen 10s of millions of dollars. But if you steal $50 million, and you have to give up five years of your life, is that a fair trade? There\u0027s a lot of people out there who would say, \"Yeah, I got a $50 million bank account in the bank nobody can touch. As soon as I get out of here, I\u0027m gonna live the high life\". Well, that\u0027s attractive to a lot of people. There\u0027s a lot of organizations out there that have operationalized it, they\u0027ve made it a business. Some of them do have a balance sheet and an income statement, and a CFO, and CEO and all that sort of thing. It\u0027s kind of a scary thing, it really is scary at that level. And then you\u0027ve got the other side of that, where you\u0027ve got some of these folks that are bad actors that are using their skill, to do things like influence the media, or influence an election, or do something like that. And we know that\u0027s going on. I mean, despite what country you\u0027re in. The British, I think, were the first ones to say, \"Hey, these people over here in this country are using Facebook to rig our election\". They were really the first ones to point that out. But it was kind of a shock to everybody else in the world. It was like, \"Where are the bad actors going next?\" Well, if you could get your person elected, you might be able to get some very lucrative contracts, or you might be able to avoid extradition. So these bad actors that we see are going to grow in new directions that we haven\u0027t really anticipated. There are going to be things happen. You\u0027re going to have ransomware on your coffeemaker Somebody in the morning will say \"Yeah, send me $1, I\u0027m not going to let you make a cup of coffee\". Your Internet of Things-monitored coffee machine, I\u0027ve taken over your icebox and your coffee maker kind of things. You\u0027re going to see crazy stuff like that start happening. But the things that should worry us are the pipelines and the telecommunications and the electrical infrastructures. I don\u0027t know how many of you might have noticed, but if we take the power grid out, you\u0027re probably not going to have an internet. Your computers probably aren\u0027t going to work. So there are certain precautions that we have taken up to this point, with our utilities and different things, that we probably haven\u0027t gone far enough with. But for ransomware to be effective, you have to have a totally terrible, it\u0027s totally crap backup strategy. If you\u0027ve got a great backup strategy and you\u0027re adhering to it, doesn\u0027t matter if it\u0027s towers of Hanoi first in first out or whatever. If you\u0027ve got a great backup strategy, and you\u0027re actually working it and you\u0027re making sure that your backups on a periodic basis are really clean and you\u0027re scrubbing them and you\u0027re doing your homework, you\u0027re not going to have the pipeline shut down. Maybe shut down for an hour two, but that\u0027s just long enough to down the hardware, go back to bare metal and bring it back up, which you can do today with the tools we have available to us in 15 to 20 minutes. So we get down everything and rebuild it the half hour. Great, if we only had the backups. So part of that problem is us learning the skills that we need, the fundamentals that we need to say, \"Okay, great. Where am I vulnerable the most?\". Well, if you can\u0027t do business continuity management, if you don\u0027t have a backup strategy, or business continuity strategy, you\u0027re vulnerable. Why wouldn\u0027t a pipeline have a backup strategy that works? Why wouldn\u0027t they have a business continuity plan that includes an incident response plan so they don\u0027t sit around for three days trying to figure out that, \"Oh, that phone call we got about ransomware. That was real. We really do have ransomware\".", "speaker": "Gordon Rudd", "timestamp": "55:38  ", "timestamp_s": 3338}, {"body": "As you\u0027re pointing out all this weak points, I was going through a mental list of movies that always picture this hackers and your blowing infrastructure. And I feel like there\u0027s an entire decade of Hollywood just be like, \"Okay, yeah, so we\u0027re gonna have a hacker now\". It\u0027s diehard 57. We\u0027re going to have a hacker, they\u0027re going to blow up traffic lights, and drones and stuff like that. But it\u0027s very real. And I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m more scared about that or more scared about the other aspect that you also mentioned, the Cambridge analytical scandal. And then, we all know that the elections were influenced. And it all seems to be fine illegal, and no one\u0027s going to jail. And no one wants to cut this out of the bag here. It\u0027s kind of like open season for everybody. So that really scares me. And especially with the scale, and a regulation that you have in places like Facebook, that are easy to manipulate public opinion. That is really something that sometimes I wake up with nightmares of. And I\u0027m not sure we have a good solution to any of that.", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "1:00:06  ", "timestamp_s": 60}, {"body": "I\u0027m not sure we do either, to be honest about it. I see the enemy and it is us. We are our own worst enemies. In America, we used to have laws that said the TV and radio had to present down to the second opposing opinions. So just to keep it at a high level. If the republicans got five minutes on one side of an issue, the democrats got the exact same amount of time to express their opinion, whatever it may be. During the Clinton administration, he allowed that law to sunset. And from then on, it\u0027s really kind of been open season, because from that point on, the corporations that have the news media in them, began to see news as entertainment. And they created entertaining news. That\u0027s why the term \"if it bleeds, it leads\", everybody knows today. Because since the Clinton administration, that\u0027s been true. They want to show you all the bad things that are going on in the world. Because we\u0027re humans, we\u0027re always going to watch the car wreck, we\u0027re always going to watch that train wreck. The thing that should concern us, beyond just the ability to influence elections and whatnot, is what if we do allow these big corporations, whoever they are, to actually censor information? So there can be no dissenting opinion about anything. What happens at that point? Well, I think as a society, there\u0027s an old book called \"The Best and The Brightest\" that was written about the Kennedy administration in the Bay of Pigs. And the whole premise of the book is very simple. John F. Kennedy had brought together the best minds in the US, some of the best minds on the planet, to be in his cabinet. Yet, when it came time to take an action, the best minds on the planet came up with the wrong answer. That groupthink that goes on, because they cause them to come up with a bad answer, is the kind of thing that the lack of censorship will do to you. It\u0027ll give you a false idea of everything that\u0027s going on and it will trigger in you fear, uncertainty, and doubt. And once I\u0027ve got you afraid, uncertain or doubtful, then I can convince you of about anything. And at that point, we lost the battle. It\u0027s one thing to rein in the technologists. But it\u0027s another thing to rein in the social engineers. And I agree with you, the cat is out of the bag. The corporations have seen the economic value of making news entertaining, so they\u0027re seeing the dollars and cents of it, there\u0027s a lot of dollars to it. So the corporations are not incentivized to stop making money, they\u0027re not going to do that. Their shareholders would be really pissed at that, \"Hey, let\u0027s make 35 cents less than share next quarter\". I don\u0027t think anybody who owns stock is gonna vote for that. So that just won\u0027t happen. But we\u0027re going to have to take some actions at some point worldwide, it can\u0027t just be one country or another. We\u0027re going to have to say things like, \"It\u0027s wrong for corporations to censor communication in any way\". You can make sure you present equal arguments or whatever, but you can\u0027t just decide that one side of an argument is correct, and just present that side. You\u0027ve got to present opposing opinions to it, and let people decide. Because that\u0027s the thing that if you notice, when you get together with your friends, you all don\u0027t agree on everything. You may each have different soccer teams that you\u0027re fans of. You may have different political parties, you\u0027re fans of. You may have motorcycles, one of you may be a Ducati fan and one of you may be a Suzuki fan kind of thing. And you may have serious debates about the merits of the different motorcycles. That\u0027s what makes us human. That\u0027s what keeps us out of the weeds. Because at some point in that conversation, even if it\u0027s about motorcycles, you\u0027re going to say, \"Darn, I wish my bike did that. That\u0027s a good point. That\u0027s a very good engineering enhancement\". We\u0027re going to have to come back to that just as a people. I mean, yeah, we can lock things down, we can secure it. But we\u0027ve got to keep power to it, we\u0027ve got to keep it connected. Then we\u0027ve got to use it appropriately. I do not believe that the people that created the internet completely understood what it would look like if it was misused. But we\u0027ve started to see some examples of that. We\u0027re seeing terrorist groups start to put their agenda out there in ways that make what they\u0027re doing look attractive to young people. People that might be vulnerable to that message. Really? That\u0027s a good thing? We got ways to go.", "speaker": "Gordon Rudd", "timestamp": "1:01:19  ", "timestamp_s": 61}, {"body": "Definitely. The internet really took the homo sapiens to the next level with all the good and all the bad thing alike. And kind of equally excited and scared to see what\u0027s coming next. I guess long story short: that\u0027s cybersecurity for you. ", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "1:05:57  ", "timestamp_s": 65}, {"body": "The next thing may be harder. We all do the same things. Every organization is secure in a certain way. You guys have got a router. Everywhere you go, you\u0027ve got switches, you\u0027ve got all the equipment. And you\u0027re probably got everything turned on. I\u0027m sure you\u0027re logging, you\u0027re taking all your logs, and you\u0027re analyzing them and you\u0027re doing all that stuff. But at the end of the day, it\u0027s still the people that have to do that. We can\u0027t turn on the machines and just let them go. We haven\u0027t got to Skynet yet. We\u0027re not there, not into that yet. But I think if you had to put your Yoda hat on and say what\u0027s coming, I would say that the thing that we\u0027re going to see is we\u0027re going to have languages that are going to come up. We\u0027ve got Python right now, it\u0027s huge in cybersecurity. Almost every security analyst has the ability to write a Python program and extract data from logs. And that\u0027s a great thing. And I think over time, you\u0027re going to see Go come up and be one of the big languages to do that same thing. Simply because it\u0027s real easy to put together. And we\u0027re going to start having what everybody euphemistically refers to as \"citizen programmers\". How many citizen programmers do you know that are really up on cybersecurity and how to create secure code? Or perhaps even the OWASP model, since they\u0027re probably going to take their code and put it on a web server, so everybody can see it. We\u0027ve got some things that we\u0027re going to have to figure out as we go along. And yes, it is scary, but I kind of look forward to the challenge. It\u0027s like, \"Alright, how can we make the world more secure? How can we keep the bad actors in place?\". All comes down to literally an old Western movie, \"What color\u0027s your hat today?\". So we\u0027re never going to be able to keep people from doing either stupid things or illegal things. Because I think it\u0027s easier than working. It\u0027s easier than earning a buck. We might be able to convince a certain set of people that security is a real deal, and that we have to do it. And these are some good practices. So that we can create that scalable, sustainable security for every organization, even pipelines. People will watch this three year, they\u0027ll come across this three years from now, \"Why do they keep talking about pipelines?", "speaker": "Gordon Rudd", "timestamp": "1:06:18  ", "timestamp_s": 66}, {"body": "Hopefully by then, we\u0027ll have a better stretch with no hacks. We\u0027ll see about that. All right, Gordon. So the episode has to come to an end. But before I let you off the hook, I wanted to ask you just one more question that typically brings out a value to our audience. If you were to pick a single item, it could be anything. It could be technical, it could be a practice, it could be a habit, it could be anything. But a single item that provided the highest return on investment for your career as a whole, what would you pick? ", "speaker": "Miko Pawlikowski", "timestamp": "1:08:34  ", "timestamp_s": 68}, {"body": "Well, I would say that the highest return on investment for my career was learning and understanding that, I don\u0027t know exactly how to say it, but I taught technology for a long, long time in post-secondary education scenarios. And I find that it\u0027s that lifelong ability to learn and to be curious and to think about things other than being stuck in that box, \"Okay, this is the way we do it\". That has had the biggest impact on my career. Just not being afraid to get out of the norm. One of my projects was to create, or to actually purchase a supercomputer from Japan and bring it online for giant gas company. And instead of doing that, well the IT guys that I worked with at the time, all came and said, \"Hey, we don\u0027t know the language it uses, a pretrial proprietary operating system that\u0027s not really Linux or Unix or Windows or anything. So we\u0027d have to learn a whole new operating system. We don\u0027t know anything about it, we have nothing that even looks like it. We don\u0027t really want to do it\". It\u0027s like, \"Well, okay, I\u0027ve got a $20 million budget for a project that isn\u0027t going to go anywhere without some support\". So bag in this back in the early 00s. I said, \"Let\u0027s create a Beowulf cluster\". Everybody looked at me like I was crazy. What\u0027s a Beowulf cluster? Well, it\u0027s just a bunch of Linux servers bolted together that hack like a supercomputer. Trust me, it\u0027ll work. So we spent a couple of weeks researching it. And we got 1024 file servers, and we got them all in racks and turned them all on and created our own version of a supercomputer. And we did it for like less than $400,000 instead of 20 million. And we were still under whatever $400,000 is, but it\u0027s that ability to think out of the box. And to understand that we\u0027re just talking about hardware and software. You can make them do anything you want them to do, you\u0027ve just got to figure out what the right application is and how to make it work for your organization. So that at the end of the day, your people are going to be running whatever you\u0027re building. It better look good. It better work good. I mean, how many apps do you have on your phone? I probably got a couple 100 apps somewhere. And most of them are off in the cloud, because they won\u0027t even fit on my phone, that I\u0027ve tried. And I\u0027m sure everybody that\u0027s got a smartphone or smart tablet does the same thing. They read about an app and they go try it. And it\u0027s like, \"Well, I\u0027m not going down that rabbit hole paying more money\". So we\u0027ve got to make things that are really efficient, that are really human-centered. That really do make the world a little better place, every time we do it. When we started doing that, then your career is going to have a high ROI. It doesn\u0027t matter what you\u0027re in. You could be in technology, science, technology, engineering, or math. You know, it\u0027s just making sure that you learn and that you\u0027re not afraid to learn and that you\u0027re not afraid to get out of the box.

So now that we've got that out of the way, the first thing that obviously strikes me when I was stalking you a little bit on LinkedIn preparing for this, is that there's a wealth of experience. Counting 35 years plus, there's been a lot of hats that you were wearing, right? I've seen programmer, project leader, manager, director, manager partner, VPC, kind of all the things that you can think of. Can you tell me a little bit more about the different transitions? As much as you want to go into the personal one. But from my perspective, it's very interesting to see what made you do this. Was it just like a natural progression of things, or particular events that influenced that? Would you mind telling me a bit about that?</p>

            </p>
            <p id="body-134" class="transcript-paragraph">Sure. Well, I worked my way through college through University of Oklahoma as a Fortran programmer. Yeah, I got a job translating differential equations into Fortran statement. Yeah, that was a job in the day. Back in the day, that was a real thing. One of the professors in the college business, I was getting an undergraduate degree in finance, one of the professors in the College of Business, asked me one day after class: Why do I keep seeing you in the computer center? I told him, I was working for a math professor translating differential equations and the Fortran statements. And he asked me if I'd come to work for him. And I just transitioned into doing decision theory models and communications protocols, and that sort of thing, for the agency that he worked for. Actually were working as subcontractors for the Department of the Navy to create these communication protocols. And then when I graduated college, it was kind of a natural segue to go to work in the defense industrial base, and work as a civilian contractor through the Department of Defense. And all the little three-letter agencies that are in there, you know, that kind of thing. And I did that for a long time. I was hanging around being a programmer. And one day the project manager quit. So the boss's boss called and said: "Hey, we need you to be the project manager. We're just going to put your name in a box, and it's alright. Don't worry about it. You don't really have to do anything". So I said, "Okay, great". So, next day, I go over to the construction trailer, where the project manager is supposed to be, and all these people show up. And they've got all these projects going on all over the planet. And nobody really seemed to know what was going on. So I took an early copy, back in the day of Harvard project manager at IBM PC, and I organized all the projects and put them on a timeline and that sort of thing. And when my boss's boss saw that he's like, "Well, you're a project manager, you're no longer worried about IT thing". So I spent several years project managing pipelines, supervisory control and data acquisition systems or skated systems, automated energy management systems, that kind of thing. And I would just put the project together and the engineers and the engineers that design it, and I would stamp it out and away we go. And then, after several years of doing that, my mom found out she had cancer. So I moved back home to take care of mom. Had to get a job, ended up in healthcare. So you know, my friends always gave me a hard time, "You spent 10 years with the defense industrial base blowing stuff up. And now you're working for a very large hospital, putting things back together". It's like, "Yeah, well, it's karma. It's just a karmic experience". So I ended up in healthcare. Spent 10 years in healthcare. We were fortunate enough, while I was there, to create what was the number one telemedicine program on the planet at the time. So we actually treated more people in one month than all the telemedicine programs up to that time treated ever. So it was very successful. And then one of my, actually a former student of mine, recruited me to go to work for the Williams companies and Telsa. And I went to work for one of their organizations, actually designing their points of presence in their fiber optic network for Williams communication. And then another one of my students found out I was working there, and he recruited me to go to energy marketing and trading. So I stood up the technology support for the quantitative analytics group at Williams, and then ended up moving on through just a series of other adventures to banking and just kind of stuck with banking. I've been either working on the backend with the technology of banks, or working in banks being chief information security officer, that kind of thing. And that seven, eight years ago, something like that, I started coaching people that wanted to get into information technology, or they wanted specifically to get into information security. And I found that there's a group of technology folks out there who don't realize why they're not C-level material. You can talk to him for a few minutes. And you can understand that they don't have the social skills, they don't have the emotional IQ, if you will, to be CISO. So I started working with them through a project I created called the "CISO Mentoring Project". And then as I got on in my career, I decided I wanted to make that a full-time job. So Stone Creek Coaching was born. And now that's what I do all day. And I help people that want to become C-level executives for either Chief Information Officer, Chief Technology Officer or Chief Information Security Officer, and I try to work with them and show them how to interact with people in such a way that they can be part of a team and they can actually be functional. And I hate to sound like some of them are broke. But some folks, when you talk to them, you just know that they're just not going to go as high as their ambitions going to want them to. Unless they make a change. And that's really what I'm all about, is trying to find those folks that really want to get to the C-level. And just help them do it. You know, that kind of thing. I spend a little time talking to venture capital companies. For some reason, three or four years ago, a venture capital company started calling me and asking me about technologies and the direction technology was going, different vendors in the tech space thing. And I kind of enjoy that. Most of those conversations are very interesting. It's been a fun career. I've just kind of gone really, to be honest with you, where my heart led me or where somebody said, "Hey, you want to try this?". And I said, "Yeah, that'll be fun. Let's do that", kind of thing. It wasn't really all planned out and mapped out. It was just more about: "Well, yeah, that looks like fun. Let's do it."</p>

            <p id="body-495" class="transcript-paragraph">Well, love it. Some of the things to touch upon here, from asking you when was the last time you wrote any Fortran to, just kind of, one thing that you mentioned is that you can look at the person and see that they might not be a C-level material. But then, at the same time, you mentioned that they can develop the skills if they work on that. It sounds like it's a set of skills rather than necessarily some innate talent or something like that. Can anybody, with enough practice and enough work put in, get to the right level of the skills? Or do you need a blend of both to be successful?</p>

            <p id="body-535" class="transcript-paragraph">Anybody in technology, as you guys know very well, you're in technology, you're a lifelong learner. If you don't love learning, you better get out of what you're doing. Because you won't be able to do it for long, the tech will advance. You won't staff breaks in the store. But when it comes to soft skills relating to people and things like that, a lot of introverted folks will spend their time with the computer, because the computer gives them instant feedback. And you know, if you're writing a program, whether it's Python or Go or whatever, you hit enter and then either runs or doesn't, then you go fix it. Well, that's great, except when you have to start dealing with the lines of business and the people that run those lines of business. And the end users. You know, we've all worked in technology situations before where somebody had pop off in a meeting, "If it wasn't for the damn users, we'd have a great job". And it's like, "Well, you know, users are why we're here. That's why we exist. That's why they keep paying us money". A lot of technical folks are so comfortable working with machines that they avoid working with people. Even if they get married and have children and have friends and that sort of thing, they still focus just exclusively on the tech and on that instant feedback, right and wrong, and they don't really pay enough attention to the soft skills and interacting with people. And if you can't interact with people, you're never going to build high performance teams. And you guys know, I mean, you do conferences all the time. You know that today in tech, high performance teams are the thing. Whether it's Kubernetes, AWS, whatever you're working in, your team has to perform at a peak level. But how do you create that team? How do you make those participants more than the sum of the parts? For instance, when I created the telemedicine program in St. Francis, I went to a meeting with the C-level folks, the CEO, CFO, all the C people were there. And the CEO said, "Okay, get some people out of IT, create the department, get it go on. Give us telemedicine". And I said, "Well, we don't have those people. We don't have any technical people that do this". And the chief financial officer, who everybody in IT reported up to at the time, was just really incensed. Leaning across the table and said, "How can you say that we don't have people that will do that?". I said, "Well, they have to understand audio compression algorithms, video compression algorithms, how to marry them. They also need to understand something about working with people, because we're going to be working with real-life patients and real-life physicians.", that kind of thing. And so they discussed it a little bit. And then they said, "Well, see what you can do by picking out people. And we'll get everybody in the different subdepartments within IT to help you out". Well, my colleagues' idea of helping out was to offer up their weakest players. Or people they didn't want to put up with anyone. And so what I did was, to take those folks and put them together as a team, and get them to perform at a higher level than anybody else in the hospital. So much so, that when anything broke, everybody else in hospital would come to a member of my team and say, "Can you help me fix this?". Well, it's kind of strange that in the space of a year, they can go from being people that nobody wanted on their team, to being the "go-to" team in that whole hospital with over 7000 employees. So, I would say that paying attention to the soft skills and being able to work as a team and be a team player, and understand that and motivate individuals to perform at a higher level. I think it's a set of skills, to your earlier point, that you have to learn. You have to be able to read people, you have to be able to emote with people, you know, a lack of empathy. You've all met people that have no empathy whatsoever, and you don't really want to hang around with them. That's kind of the thing that it hinges on. Do you care about the people on your team? Do you know the names of their significant others and their children and their dogs and their cats, goldfish or whatever? Are you close enough to them to understand what motivates them, and what demotivates them. And then figure out exactly what you need to do to get your projects done and move it along at a higher level. That's really what it's all about. It's just getting the team to buy into what's going on. Look at a more specific example. Look at what Tom Brady did for the Buccaneers last year. Just go back to football, he went in, kind of reorganize the thought patterns and the way that everybody related and started communicating at a very high level. He didn't just communicate with people on offense, he communicated with everybody that would listen. And what he did, was to bring together a team of people that probably would have finished middle of the pack. And instead, they ended up winning the Super Bowl. And it wasn't even close. By the end of the season, they were the killer team in the league. And that's really what you want to do. You want to be able to bring these people along, communicate with them. Make sure everybody understands where you are, what your objectives are. And then just get out of their way. Let them go. Because once you empower people, they tend to take off and just sore on their own. Does that make sense? </p>

            <p id="body-855" class="transcript-paragraph">It does. And it really lands very close to home. I myself made the transition couple of years ago from being a tech leader to trying to help the team performing. And like you said, this kind of instant response that you get from tech, it works or it doesn't. Or satisfies or passes the test or doesn't. And then all of a sudden you're in this sea of feelings and things that are hard to measure. Performance itself of a team, it's not that easy to measure by itself. And I think that a lot of the points you touched upon, it kind of realize quickly that it's more about being like a coach and physically, making sure that the team feels good. Human beings, they enjoy hanging out together. It's probably one of the most important and difficult things at the same time.</p>

            <p id="body-911" class="transcript-paragraph">Every time you have a World Cup, it's not necessarily the most talented team that wins. But it's the group that plays together as a unit, so that the coach and everybody on that soccer team plays together as a team. They function very well together and they go from a lot of games they probably should have won to winning those games, and then exceeding expectations. And then the next thing you know, they catch fire, and they're in a World Cup final simply, because they all started working together as a unit, and stop being the individuals out there all trying to run around and score. To me, that was always the kind of the funny thing about soccer, everybody can score. Let's just all go score. It was a little different. But I think it's very much the same thing. It happens. We see it in sports all the time. Why can't we see that in the workplace? Why can't we see it in technology? Well, it's because we don't teach those skills, we don't stop and say, "How can we make this individual the leader of a high performance team? What can we give him or her, from a skill set point of view, that will make them successful?". It's actually not that hard, once you understand that. It's just getting the people to believe in it. I work with people all the time that will say things like, "Well, I can't do this, because bla bla bla bla bla". And when you listen to it, it's just like, if we could record this and play it back to you, you probably would never say that again. It doesn't make any sense. And maybe there's a better way to communicate that, that kind of thing. We've all been on the phone with helpdesk people that we know didn't want to be there. Crazy things, basically just to get you to hang up and try and get somebody else. Those types of things are just part of learning to deal with people.</p>

            <p id="body-1029" class="transcript-paragraph">And I can see, from the examples you choose to describe that, why you would transition into this coaching and getting the satisfaction and the scale of the impact that you can make is higher.

              Gordon Rudd
            </p>
            <p id="body-1048" class="transcript-paragraph">Well, it was. I've always had a different way of looking at work and looking at the people that are in it, and looking at the corporate culture that surrounds it, than most people. I really have, over the years, become a student of corporate culture. And you can see a lot of corporate cultures that start out really strong, and then go wonky. And all of us that, that's a technical term: "wonky". That kind of just go south on everybody, and it just doesn't work. And it's unfair to the people. It's unfair to the folks that are in these jobs. And then lately, I've guess lately, over the last 10 years, I've seen technical people spend less and less time trying to put a good job description into HR, for whatever reason. Whether or not their boss won't approve it. The management team doesn't think you need another one of those, let's say, server administrator, but they think you'll need another security analyst. So you get a job description for a security analyst going to HR, and they're kicking out everybody that's in security. And they're saying, "We really want to Server Admin, that's really what we're looking for. Give me somebody that says they're a Server Admin", kind of thing. So we've got this disconnect in corporate America or corporations around the world for that matter. In fact, a lot of the people I work with are in the UK, France, significant number of people in France. Not that the French are broken by any means. I do work in France, South Africa, Australia, this is really a global problem. It's not just something that's indicative to America, or just the North American continent. We have to spend more time working with our HR partners to get better job description. So on the other hand, we can get better candidates so that we can find the right skill set, and put those folks in a position where they can thrive. They can survive, they can thrive, and they can be happy. It's one of those things that we all want to be happy in our job. We all want a high level of job satisfaction. But that job satisfaction is really what everybody's looking for in that high level of job satisfaction. And the only way we can get that is by working together as people to solve problems, and by being a better corporate structure to fit into. And that's really kind of interesting when you stop and think about it, that the corporate culture is going to really set the tone for everybody in it. And they're going to ignore the technology people. And no disrespect to HR or anybody else. But the old saying, "Let's shut down HR for a week and see if anybody notices. And let's turn off IT for an hour and see who gets fired". That's kind of a thing that's always going on in organizations. We can't live without the tech anymore. But we have not figured out the care and feeding of the people that are technologists, that work in it. We haven't really stopped and taken a look at the individuals and their jobs and what they do for a living, so that we can make sense of it. If you look at a Server Admin. If you and I are a Server Admin, and we're doing the normal Server Admin thing, we can take care of 17/18 servers if they're individual units. Or maybe 27, if we've got them racked up. At Google, the metric they use, is every Server Admin has 10,000 servers to take care of. Well, that's because they've got the tools to do it. They've developed those tools. And just like developing those kinds of technology tools, we need to develop the human capital, we need to develop the human tools to drive it. And that's really the thing that got me into coaching. I keep seeing this mismatch. You can read job descriptions on any platform you choose. And you look at job descriptions and you say that, "Yeah, I wish I could find that person, because they can do absolutely everything in technology. There's nothing that person can't do". There's no job on the planet. Even if your hands on one person that's running the ID shop, there's nobody that's going to have all those skills, there's just no way. So why did that even make it into a LinkedIn or an Indeed, or one of the big boards? Why did that even make it out into the wild? What's wrong with that job description? Now, is the person that gets that job going to be happy in it? Well, maybe if we happen to get lucky and match somebody to stay with the Server Admin. If we happen to find somebody that's willing to do a server admin role, that's really what we need, then we're gonna do it. Most of the time, what happens is the people looking at it from outside that want to apply for that job, are going to read the job description, and are going to want to try and fit into it. And a lot of what I coach is, if you see a bad job description, it's probably not a good organization, or somebody is not spending a lot of time on it. So you might want to do a little more homework and find out more about that company, find out more about that job to make sure that you know exactly what's going to happen when you hit the ground. Because that's really the thing. I don't know if you guys have ever done it, but I've actually gone to the job before and on day one, they basically told me that everything I thought about the job was wrong. And I was going to do something different. That's like, "Okay". I'm not sure what you think of that. But I don't think much of that. It's kind of like, okay, we just got bid on a bait and switch.</p>

            </p>
            <p id="body-1388" class="transcript-paragraph">Yeah, exactly. Bait and switch. That's the technical term for that. I'm curious about what the process looks like. How does one become your padawan and then eventually gets the blessing go forth and be C-level? Because a lot of the things that you mentioned, they are tricky in the respect that they make sense. It's kind of the things that everybody will agree if you tell them that. But then, when the proverbial rubber hits the proverbial road, that's where things get tricky. So how do you like really help people with the soft skills? I understand that the prerequisite is that they want to change and they want to see that. But I expect this is very different process from what we're all used to in learning technical skills. Can you tell tell me a bit more about the process? Unless that's obviously your secret sauce...</p>

            

            <p id="1446">

              Gordon Rudd
            </p>
            <p id="body-1446" class="transcript-paragraph">It's not really a secret sauce. It's just really simple. The thing that I always do, and the framework that I've created, that I use, is simply starting off by getting their head right. By saying, "Why are you here? Why are you doing what you're doing? Are you happy doing it? What's good about it, what's bad about it?". And then a lot of times what I'll do after we have a series of conversations about who they are right now, and what their aspirations are, where they want to grow into, why are they asking me to coach them, that kind of thing. I may give them a skills inventory, like the Myers Briggs or True Colors, or one of those that will actually divide personality types up into basically four buckets, kind of thing, and let them see themselves. So if you're looking at these personality traits, if you're doing Myers Briggs, and they're giving you IJENS. What does that mean? It helps the individual to say, "Okay, I am introverted. I'm really not going to be the person in a social situation that's going to be walking around talking to people at a party, I'm the one that's going to be standing in the corner". Once we get the individual to get their mind right and understand who they really are. And understand what their triggers are, everybody has triggers. I've got triggers you've got triggers, Mark has triggers. There are certain things you know you can say to Mark, they're gonna light him up. And it works the other way around too. Especially with your all's relationship, then that sort of things true. Well, if you can recognize those in yourself, then you can take the intellectual leap at first before you can actually do it. And say, "I see where this is going, I understand how I feel. And I know where that normally would lead. So I'm going to choose to feel differently about that this time". And then you start making a series of decisions, you can't control the decision you've already made. Those decisions that are in the past, they're gone. You can only control the next one. So the next time that happens, you've got to make the intellectual decision, "Okay, I'm not going to go off on him. I'm not going to say that, because that Institute's three or four different exchanges, that always end up in us not talking for a while, saying evil things about each other". Just like siblings normally do. But we've all got those triggers, and we carry them into corporate America with us. So you can sit in the meeting, and you can be fine. And then somebody will say something, and just the wrong way, all of a sudden, your blood pressure's going up and your cheeks are turning red. Now you can keep from killing that individual. I want to strangle him or her. Well, if you don't understand that, and you don't understand that cue, you're very likely to just pop off and say something that's inappropriate. And it's at that point that your capital within the corporation starts to decrease, and they start to see you as a technology person. Humans, as you pointed out, our group behavior people. We want to be in groups, we want to be in tribes. But when you look at the C-level people as a tribe, to get into that tribe, they're going to have to do some normal things that we all do. They're going to have to say, "Do you fit in this group? Would I get along with you, if you were in this group? Would I enjoy working with you?". Well, if the answer to any one of those questions is: "I don't think so. That person's real hell on wheels, I don't want to deal with them". Well, you're never going to get in C-level at that organization. And if you hide behind the technology constantly, and you fail to get out in front of people, you fail to be able to communicate your message, you're going to have a problem. Think about it, you're very good at expressing yourself. You can take an idea, you can write it, you can communicate it in writing, or you can do what you're doing and communicate it by speaking to people. That's a skill. Not every technologist has that skill. Most of them, if you stood them up in front of a group of other technologists and said, "Give me a presentation on DNS". They'd be like, "I'm not doing a presentation. Well, you know, DNS, right? Yeah, I know, DNS inside and out. I've got it. I've even got three certs that say I know DNS. So why can't you give the presentation? I can't talk in front of people". That's something we got to get over, if we're going to be at the C-leve. Because they're going to expect you to not only chat with them, but to present to the board and present outside the organization. So it's those kinds of skills that we can teach the individual to help them fit in better. Help them make better decisions so that they're doing things a little different. And I've found that once a technologist wakes up, if you'll forgive the analogy, wakes up to the fact that how they act and how they behave, affects more than just them. Then all of a sudden, they start making different technology decisions. I don't necessarily mean that they're making better decisions, or that there's some magic in it. What I mean is, they're starting to make decisions that are based on the organization and the people in it, instead of just how well the tech works together. You guys all know, everybody is listening to this, I'm sure you know, people that will bolt together a bunch of technology because it seems to fit together, the tech works together. And it's really great. But the end users are suffering because it's not that user-friendly. You watch these people as they grow and develop making different technology decisions. They're starting to think about people differently. They're starting to think about their organization and their role within the organization differently. And it's at that point, that you change the corporate culture, that you get a more positive corporate culture and you stop getting the silos. You don't necessarily eliminate them, but you certainly start breaking down the walls between the different departments. So that you're not going to have IT being a standalone silo, and nobody gets to go visit them without a hall pass. You've all been in organizations out there, but you can't even get into the IT people to see them. They're behind some locked door. Well, that doesn't do anybody I hope. You need to be able to consider and be part of the organization.</p>

            <p id="body-1821" class="transcript-paragraph">Definitely. I'm sorry, I was laughing at the DNS, because one of my favorite Haiku is about DNS. It goes like this: "It's not DNS. It can't possibly be DNS. It was DNS". Brings so many memories. Yeah, there's so much I can relate to, what you just said. As you were talking about us realizing that in the context of where we are right now, you know, in the middle, well, hopefully towards the end now, but in a pandemic, where a lot of this interactions went online. And sure, we have video conferences now. And it's probably easier than it was in the past. But it's still tricky. And I'm wondering, how do you see this affecting people's soft skills? And do you think that's going to have like a long lasting effect, in general, on how teams will cooperate and interact?</p>

            <p id="body-1882" class="transcript-paragraph">I believe it will. But I'm not necessarily sure that it's going to be what we think. The organization that I just came out of, we all had laptops, and when we all got sent home, it wasn't a big deal, because everybody had a laptop. Because from time to time, the ladies that had children or the men that had families would take their turn staying home with a sick kid, or they'd be going to a ballgame, out of state or something. But they would all be able to log in and do something and take care of business. So it wasn't a big deal. But as an organization, we weren't using video. There were so many people that were using zoom and teams and just using it for an audio connection and let it go. So the CEO decided, "Hey, we're video-forward, we're always going to turn on our video". And a couple weeks later, I seriously thought about sending an email and say, "The corollary to that would have been to stop wearing sweatshirts and T-shirts, and crappy clothing, when you're on these video calls, especially with clients! Put on a shirt with a collar for the love of God. Get your act together". Podcasting is its own thing. But if I'm dealing with a client, and I'm sitting there as a representative of an organization that I don't see in myself a responsibility to put my best self forward or to understand what being video-forward means. What good am I? Might be a guy that if you see his picture, like we can see your brother right now. That little icon thing that we give each other when we don't want to be seen. You see that the guy's got a suit and tie, he shaved, he's got a haircut. You see him in real life, he's got a beard that scraggly and hair tied back. He's got everything going on,. It looks like he's been in a cave for five years, you know? And it's like, why would you want to do that? You know, why wouldn't you want to put your best foot forward? And it's just those realizations that we don't take the time to tie up within an organization. Now you can tell that I'm older and have a more classic sense about this, obviously. But we should take the time to explain to, especially, to the younger ones, why it's important to wear a shirt with a collar. Why it's important to do these things. And no, I'm not talking about you, you can edit yourself to look like whatever you want.</p>

            <p id="body-2034" class="transcript-paragraph">Post, there you go. But doing things like that will help us, I think, to become closer because there's a certain respect in it. On the other hand, we've all been on these calls where we got to know the people's kids. I worked with a lady that had four kids, her husband and her working from home. So there was always a kid and there was two or three dogs. So there was always a dog, and a kid and maybe a cat from time to time. Every time we'd have a video conference, these things would be going on. And people would have their grandkids and that sort of thing. So from that perspective, we really got to see into people's homes, we got to see into their lives. We got to know them on a much deeper level. So part of that bonding, you're never going to be able to replace in the office, because everybody shows up and puts on a mask and plays the role that they're supposed to play in the office. We get them at home with four kids running around and two dogs and whatever and you get to see the real person, you get to know the real human that's been on the other side of that video. Which is good, because then you understand why she's always in a T-shirt, or why she's always in a sweatshirt and why they're doing these things. I remember one day being on the call with the same lady. And she said, "Just give me two minutes, I got to go change my shirt. The baby just threw up on me". And she comes back and sits down like two minutes later. And she says, "That's the fourth time I've had to do that this morning". I get that. And that's a humanizing thing. But that's not something you'd want to do with a client. That's something that you do with your co-workers to get to know each other better. And that's really what it's all about, is just trying to get to know each other better. Because look, cybersecurity, we're all a very small family. So we should all be able to band together and make some changes. We should all be able to help our HR department come up with better job descriptions. We should all be able to institute programs within our corporations to help the individuals become, not only better people, but better employees, and work with them on their pain points. We all have those pain points that, we'd really like to eliminate. And that's the kind of thing that I really like to help organizations with, is to see where things that they might think are great in their corporate culture might not be as great as they think. Give you a specific example. How many organizations do you know today that still have the big blowout Christmas parties? I mean, the big organizations used to rent out a hotel, and they'd have these giant, blowout Christmas parties with an open bar and all the orders and dinner and entertainment and all this sort of thing. They do that all the time. Well, they don't do that anymore. Well, what are they doing to replace it? How are they helping their people to interact? The people that I work with in Europe, when they take a holiday, they go away for a month or two. I mean, that's a holiday to them. To us, that's being laid off. That's different. So, you guys in Europe have a totally different philosophy. I think, a lot of times, it's much better philosophy, in my humble opinion, about trying to get to know your co-workers. I used to work with an organization that had some consultants and from SAP. Those guys literally got together every Friday afternoon. They shut all the work down, and they get together and do a little wine and cheese thing, get to know each other and then go home to their families. There was more work that got done in the three hours that we spent together on Friday afternoon, then practically the rest of the week. Because everybody stopped playing a worker row and start playing that human interaction game where, okay, what can I do to help you? How can I help you? And one of the things that I did out of that, that I actually just stole it from the guy that was in charge of consulting assignment there at that organization. He used to do this thing on Monday morning that he referred to as "calendaring up" and he'd get the whole team around the table. And all we do is you'd go around the table, and just ask what's on your calendar for the next week? And what would happen is, you know, we'd go along, two or three people would say something, then somebody would say, "I'm going to install a new router". And somebody across the table say, "No, you're not. You can't install a router until I do this". It was basically taking everything. And I don't think this was an accident, because he was taking everything, all the human capital that he'd built up with the wine and cheese parties on Friday, and then the first thing Monday morning, he was having the same team plan out their week. So they did it as a team. He rarely, if ever, gave any direction. It was just like, what's on your calendar? What are you going to be doing this week? And whatever you said you were going to be doing is okay, unless somebody needed you to do something else. And it forced you to be a part of the team. It also forced you to change your priorities to help a teammate. Think about the difference in that particular philosophy. And I don't know if it was the individuals or if it was a corporate philosophy or what, but that gentleman and his particular philosophy, is so much sounder and so much more productive than, just "Okay, we got to get it done by Thursday". Never been a fan of "got to get it done by Thursday". </p>

            <p id="body-2361" class="transcript-paragraph">I can really relate to the aspect of humanizing your colleagues and this, kind of, unexpected aspect of actually seeing a little insight through the computer window to how people are doing. And I know I'm guilty of wearing tracksuits and what feels like five years in my cave right now. So, I can relate to that too. And especially for my friends who actually have small kids and have to take care of them. Especially during the period when there was no daycare or anything. I'm really in awe of how they were able to find time for all of them. And, at the same time, remain productive. And that really gave us all opportunity to support each other on a different level. And it's weird. In many ways I feel starved of the social interaction. Just be able to walk on to someone rather than having to start a video call. At the same time, I feel like I met people in a different way, too. So yeah, definitely can relate to the aspects of what you were saying. I'm gonna take us a little bit on a different track now. I want to make sure that we talk a little bit about the cyber security. Since I've got you and for everybody who listens on to that there's a session by Gordon called "Scalable, Sustainable Cybersecurity for Any Size Organization" at the Conf42 Python. So, I guess we'll touch a little bit on that, too. But before we even get into that, how would you define cyber security in general? Because, before I met some friends in cybersecurity, it always looked to me like this magic. And you know, if you watch Hollywood movies, obviously, they just "do doo doo doo doo doo" on the keyboard and things magically happen. And then it's kind of disappointing to learn that outage or that hacked actually was because someone could take selfie, they didn't need to. Or because the default settings were public and you could actually download all the data from S3. And that was a problem. How would you define cyber security? And I'm sure you have plenty of great anecdotes. So, if you could give us one or two to illustrate what it means in practice, that would be great.</p>

            </p>
            <p id="body-2503" class="transcript-paragraph">I came into cybersecurity out of IT. So I had, when I first started, a traditional IT view of it. While I was at the Williams companies, I got the assignment to be one of the top two or three people in cybersecurity and actually help them stand up the cyber security organization, the information security kind of thing. And there is a bit of a difference in information security and cybersecurity. Information security includes everything spoken, written, that sort of thing. Cybersecurity, is basically what's happening on the wire, what's happening on the internet, what's happening on your network, as it were. But in starting out that way, literally, the first day, I'm on the job that's really security at Williams, I get a call from the IBM at nine o'clock in the morning. And the agent on the other end of the phone says, "Hey, you guys are selling the Harry Potter movie that just opened in Frankfurt, Germany, across your network. And worse than that, you're sending it from your network to the IBM network", which made some sense, given the proximity those offices in city we were in. And I was like, "No kidding, really?". And he's like, "Yeah, you might want to look into that and see if you can fix it". Well, the FBI, they have for the longest time had some serious cyber talent. So I'm sitting there, trying to just hung up. Hadn't been 30 seconds, I'm trying to figure out who to call first, my boss? Who am I going to tell this to? How am I going to solve this problem? When I get a call and on the caller ID it says "IBM", and I'm like, "Oh, this might be good". So I pick up the phone and sure enough, it's IBM, you guys are traffic going across our network, you traffic in 45 megabits. And you got to remember this is in the early 00s. So 45 megabits was probably about half the bandwidth of that IBM office. You're traveling 45 megabits across our network, and it's the Harry Potter movie that's just been released. So we drill down on it and we find that because we have a big internet pipe, there is literally a data entry person who's entering invoices in the basement of the building where we were in, that thought kozar was a great idea and put it on his laptop. And because of our bandwidth, because all nominated him a super server. So he was serving the entire world soft. Now we've just gone through the thing, not the year before, where we had our own server that had a bunch of songs on it and we'd gotten the letter from the digital rights management people that said, "You know, you got to quit that, or we're gonna fine you $100,000 for every song". But since there were over 100,000 songs on that server, one of our vice presidents and our general counsel suggested that we give that up, stop doing that. We hadn't been doing that thing in a year, but apparently others in the organization didn't get the memo. So we spent probably the next 10-12 hours trying to find where that Harry Potter movie was coming from. And we did manage to find a couple of DVDs of pornography on a file server in Houston, Texas. That was is being used to actually transfer blueprints back and forth between architects and construction companies that we maintain. Because we're building pipelines and doing rightaway work and all that sort of thing. It was really kind of amazing to me, we could find that and we could turn that off. But whoever was trafficking Harry Potter had a set of skills that we hadn't seen. And this is, again, back in like, 2001, early 2001. So I started looking into why don't we have the skills. Because I think these guys are extraordinarily talented, and a lot of them were. But they really hadn't focused on cybersecurity, they hadn't focused on what would a bad actor want to do? What would a bad person want to do here? What would a thief do? That old thing of "it takes a thief to catch a thief" is probably kind of true. It's just like DNS is never the problem. And it always ends up being the problem, kind of thing. If you can figure out what the bad actor is really trying to accomplish, then you can make the organization more secure. So as I took off in cybersecurity in my career from that point, I started trying to make sure that I was always looking at the skill set of players. You can find some serious, serious talent in the hacking community. That's the thing I love about DEF CON. Well, especially DEF CON, but black hat and DEF CON kind of thing. There's some serious engineering talent there. They don't just break things because they like breaking them, which yeah, they do, by the way. But they do break things so that they can show the people that are building them where those flaws are, so that the bad actors can't shut down a pipeline. Now if you fast forward, we've gotten to a point where we had Stuxnet, however you pronounce, that come out there and was built for the specific reason of shutting down power plants. So we can take a nuclear power plant or an electric generation station, and we can melt them down. If we use this software in the right way. Well, then what happens if somebody bad gets ahold of it? What if it's no longer just one of those things that's a theoretical thing that we could do with it. But somebody weaponizes it. And then what are they going to do with it? And right now, we've got like three layers of things going on. We've got the standard script kiddies, the kids in their mom's basement doing things, and some of them are in their 30s now. We've got script kiddies in the basement doing their thing. And then we've got guys and gals that are doing hacking for a living. And one of the most fun things you can do is when you get one of those calls, that you know is trying to sell you an extended warranty on your car, or some other bizarre call. The latest one I got said they were from the FBI kind of thing. I always want to talk to those people, I love to talk to them. Because once you get on to a person, if you listen closely, you can hear other people in the background, you're talking to a call center. So the bad actors have operationalize the things they know make them a little money. So we've got romance scams coming out, we've got spam email coming out, we've got all these things that are designed to give the bad actor access to your money. And that's really all they want. They don't care about you, they just want your money. Anybody can take an identity and prop up a new identity and put some credentials with it that are serious. But getting money out of the bank account and moving it on down the line to a bank where you can take the cash out: that's a set of skills that require a lot of people and a lot of work. And how do you interrupt that. It's like a supply chain. Then we have cyber security professionals look at interrupting that supply chain. And then the third level are those people out there that we may never know, that nation states that have all the money and all the resources. When they become involved, there's a level of excellence that's kind of like going from Windows 95, to the latest version of Linux. They are so much further ahead of where everybody else is. It's unbelievable. Because they understand the value of training, they understand the value of spending money on top quality assets, that kind of thing. I'm not worried about the guy that's going to go to Las Vegas and rent the Ferrari and rent out a villa and be all showy about it, because that person is going to get caught. I'm worried about the guy that's driving around in a Subaru or a minivan and isn't really doing anything other than being a stay at home dad or a soccer mom that has a set of skills that will allow them to do things that other people may not totally understand. And they are also, almost every time, those same people are going to have social skills to the point that they can reorganize the way you think in such a manner that they can get you to click on something or take an action that's going to give them access to something that they shouldn't have. And it's at that point that you have to wonder, why am I doing this? These people are so much, they're functioning at such a higher level than we are. The bank I worked at, for instance, had something on the order of five or six hundred million bad things that would go by the firewall, and you could watch it. Okay, that's a botnet that's searching that somebody's trying to map the network. That somebody's trying to geo locate us, you know, and on and on and on. It'd be impossible today to stop all that. So what we have to do, as cybersecurity professionals, is figure out how we can make cybersecurity that team sport that we keep talking about. How we can make sure that the entire organization is involved, all the way from the chairman of the board to the janitor. Everybody's got to be involved in it, because at every step, there's an opportunity for a compromise. And that's what we're trying to do is take those compromises away, so that if a bad actor does do something untoward, we've at least got a heads up and we can say, "Let's turn that network segment off. Let's kill that core, let's take some action". And then we'd like to practice it, as cyber professionals, so that we want to reach out and turn Mark off so that he can't do any further harm. We can just say, "Okay, let's kill that now". And we can reach out, turn him off, and not let him continue the activity that that he's into. And those kinds of things are really where we're going. We're getting to a point that we've got to have every single person at least aware of the current pain point. So our threat feeds, our vulnerability assessments in our patch management programs have to interact together in a way that makes sense for us all. I think we're just kind of waking up to that. You know, I can't tell you how many organizations don't have threat intelligence, but they have scans and network and do know all the assets on their network. Okay, if you don't have threat intelligence, formal threat intelligence, not just one person that's looking on the internet every morning over coffee, you really do have threat intelligence, what's relative? Well, it's relative, it's on your network. So if you've got your assets identified, it's relevant. And then if you know where your are in your patches, you can tell whether or not it's relative. Let's take Spectre and Meltdown. Those two came out, it made a big splash, I have to go talk to the board. And the board's asking, "Well, okay, we've identified the threat. We know we're vulnerable, because we have all this information you've just given us. So what are we going to do about it?". And I'm stuck saying: "Nothing". Right now, the patch that Microsoft gives us in our test servers, makes the applications run so slow, they don't appear to be running at all. So it in effect, breaks everything. So we can patch it, but it'll break everything. Of course, the people on board are just, "Oh, we don't want to do that. That might be bad". Well, yeah. Turn off IT for an hour and see who gets fired. Come back to that. So you've got to be able to take this intelligence and disseminate it further than ever. It's got to go to more people, it's got to go up the chain and down the chain, so that the people on the lines of business understand that Spectre and Meltdown probably aren't a bad thing. Because we've got the perimeter secure and this is how we've secured it. They've got to understand the overlapping layers of security enough so that if we do miss something, and we've got to listen too, that's the other thing. We've got to listen, if somebody does come up from inside the organization and say, "Hey, what about this?". We don't just dismiss them out of hand, because they're not part of the security team. We actually listen to them and say, "Well, what if that's a real deal? What if we do have a hole there? What if this person has found something?"</p>

            </p>
            <p id="body-3228" class="transcript-paragraph">Yeah, I got to say like the hardware problems, that was a real kind of eye-opener for myself. Because for such a long time, we just kind of assumed that there was no real servers for attack. And then "Boom!", all of a sudden turns out wrong. And there probably will be more. And another thing that, in the recent weeks, we obviously had the colonial pipeline ransomware attack. And when you were talking about individuals having the skills that are just kind of above what every gear person suspects, I also realized, with the work of the journalists around that, that it's actually a pretty big industry right now, the ransomware stuff. And I was pretty surprised to discover that the group that did the ransom thing to actually outsource to another group installing the ransomware, and they were very public about that. And then you have this group of people and they publish statements, make a public company or something. And it looks like it's no longer these individuals proving something from the basement. It's just a business like any other and there are some pretty scary statistics about how many companies actually pay this ransoms, because they have no real other option. So do you see this kind of on the rise, just because of the overall number of systems growing. And, by definition, the system's always been behind the exploits that you can just google on the internet and someone can use that. Is that by definition a losing battle that we have with cybersecurity, that we always have these systems that will be vulnerable.</p>

            </p>
            <p id="body-3338" class="transcript-paragraph">That's true. The average bad actor is on your network for over 270 days. Well, depending on who you listen to. Some people say 260, some 280, but let's split it there, on your network for 270 days before they actually do anything bad. They're watching and mapping and escalating privileges and, and walking themselves up to a point that they can do what they want to do kind of thing. It's unfortunate, but you're right, the bad actors are going to be able to attract more people to their side of it. Because in a worst case scenario, you may steal 10 or $15 million, and you may end up in jail for three years, or five years, if you've stolen 10s of millions of dollars. But if you steal $50 million, and you have to give up five years of your life, is that a fair trade? There's a lot of people out there who would say, "Yeah, I got a $50 million bank account in the bank nobody can touch. As soon as I get out of here, I'm gonna live the high life". Well, that's attractive to a lot of people. There's a lot of organizations out there that have operationalized it, they've made it a business. Some of them do have a balance sheet and an income statement, and a CFO, and CEO and all that sort of thing. It's kind of a scary thing, it really is scary at that level. And then you've got the other side of that, where you've got some of these folks that are bad actors that are using their skill, to do things like influence the media, or influence an election, or do something like that. And we know that's going on. I mean, despite what country you're in. The British, I think, were the first ones to say, "Hey, these people over here in this country are using Facebook to rig our election". They were really the first ones to point that out. But it was kind of a shock to everybody else in the world. It was like, "Where are the bad actors going next?" Well, if you could get your person elected, you might be able to get some very lucrative contracts, or you might be able to avoid extradition. So these bad actors that we see are going to grow in new directions that we haven't really anticipated. There are going to be things happen. You're going to have ransomware on your coffeemaker Somebody in the morning will say "Yeah, send me $1, I'm not going to let you make a cup of coffee". Your Internet of Things-monitored coffee machine, I've taken over your icebox and your coffee maker kind of things. You're going to see crazy stuff like that start happening. But the things that should worry us are the pipelines and the telecommunications and the electrical infrastructures. I don't know how many of you might have noticed, but if we take the power grid out, you're probably not going to have an internet. Your computers probably aren't going to work. So there are certain precautions that we have taken up to this point, with our utilities and different things, that we probably haven't gone far enough with. But for ransomware to be effective, you have to have a totally terrible, it's totally crap backup strategy. If you've got a great backup strategy and you're adhering to it, doesn't matter if it's towers of Hanoi first in first out or whatever. If you've got a great backup strategy, and you're actually working it and you're making sure that your backups on a periodic basis are really clean and you're scrubbing them and you're doing your homework, you're not going to have the pipeline shut down. Maybe shut down for an hour two, but that's just long enough to down the hardware, go back to bare metal and bring it back up, which you can do today with the tools we have available to us in 15 to 20 minutes. So we get down everything and rebuild it the half hour. Great, if we only had the backups. So part of that problem is us learning the skills that we need, the fundamentals that we need to say, "Okay, great. Where am I vulnerable the most?". Well, if you can't do business continuity management, if you don't have a backup strategy, or business continuity strategy, you're vulnerable. Why wouldn't a pipeline have a backup strategy that works? Why wouldn't they have a business continuity plan that includes an incident response plan so they don't sit around for three days trying to figure out that, "Oh, that phone call we got about ransomware.

            <p id="body-60" class="transcript-paragraph">As you're pointing out all this weak points, I was going through a mental list of movies that always picture this hackers and your blowing infrastructure. And I feel like there's an entire decade of Hollywood just be like, "Okay, yeah, so we're gonna have a hacker now". It's diehard 57. We're going to have a hacker, they're going to blow up traffic lights, and drones and stuff like that. But it's very real. And I don't know if I'm more scared about that or more scared about the other aspect that you also mentioned, the Cambridge analytical scandal. And then, we all know that the elections were influenced. And it all seems to be fine illegal, and no one's going to jail. And no one wants to cut this out of the bag here. It's kind of like open season for everybody. So that really scares me. And especially with the scale, and a regulation that you have in places like Facebook, that are easy to manipulate public opinion. That is really something that sometimes I wake up with nightmares of. And I'm not sure we have a good solution to any of that.</p>

            </p>
            <p id="body-61" class="transcript-paragraph">I'm not sure we do either, to be honest about it. I see the enemy and it is us. We are our own worst enemies. In America, we used to have laws that said the TV and radio had to present down to the second opposing opinions. So just to keep it at a high level. If the republicans got five minutes on one side of an issue, the democrats got the exact same amount of time to express their opinion, whatever it may be. During the Clinton administration, he allowed that law to sunset. And from then on, it's really kind of been open season, because from that point on, the corporations that have the news media in them, began to see news as entertainment. And they created entertaining news. That's why the term "if it bleeds, it leads", everybody knows today. Because since the Clinton administration, that's been true. They want to show you all the bad things that are going on in the world. Because we're humans, we're always going to watch the car wreck, we're always going to watch that train wreck. The thing that should concern us, beyond just the ability to influence elections and whatnot, is what if we do allow these big corporations, whoever they are, to actually censor information? So there can be no dissenting opinion about anything. What happens at that point? Well, I think as a society, there's an old book called "The Best and The Brightest" that was written about the Kennedy administration in the Bay of Pigs. And the whole premise of the book is very simple. John F. Kennedy had brought together the best minds in the US, some of the best minds on the planet, to be in his cabinet. Yet, when it came time to take an action, the best minds on the planet came up with the wrong answer. That groupthink that goes on, because they cause them to come up with a bad answer, is the kind of thing that the lack of censorship will do to you. It'll give you a false idea of everything that's going on and it will trigger in you fear, uncertainty, and doubt. And once I've got you afraid, uncertain or doubtful, then I can convince you of about anything. And at that point, we lost the battle. It's one thing to rein in the technologists. But it's another thing to rein in the social engineers. And I agree with you, the cat is out of the bag. The corporations have seen the economic value of making news entertaining, so they're seeing the dollars and cents of it, there's a lot of dollars to it. So the corporations are not incentivized to stop making money, they're not going to do that. Their shareholders would be really pissed at that, "Hey, let's make 35 cents less than share next quarter". I don't think anybody who owns stock is gonna vote for that. So that just won't happen. But we're going to have to take some actions at some point worldwide, it can't just be one country or another. We're going to have to say things like, "It's wrong for corporations to censor communication in any way". You can make sure you present equal arguments or whatever, but you can't just decide that one side of an argument is correct, and just present that side. You've got to present opposing opinions to it, and let people decide. Because that's the thing that if you notice, when you get together with your friends, you all don't agree on everything. You may each have different soccer teams that you're fans of. You may have different political parties, you're fans of. You may have motorcycles, one of you may be a Ducati fan and one of you may be a Suzuki fan kind of thing. And you may have serious debates about the merits of the different motorcycles. That's what makes us human. That's what keeps us out of the weeds. Because at some point in that conversation, even if it's about motorcycles, you're going to say, "Darn, I wish my bike did that. That's a good point. That's a very good engineering enhancement". We're going to have to come back to that just as a people. I mean, yeah, we can lock things down, we can secure it. But we've got to keep power to it, we've got to keep it connected. Then we've got to use it appropriately. I do not believe that the people that created the internet completely understood what it would look like if it was misused. But we've started to see some examples of that. We're seeing terrorist groups start to put their agenda out there in ways that make what they're doing look attractive to young people. People that might be vulnerable to that message. Really? That's a good thing? We got ways to go.</p>

            <p id="body-65" class="transcript-paragraph">Definitely. The internet really took the homo sapiens to the next level with all the good and all the bad thing alike. And kind of equally excited and scared to see what's coming next. I guess long story short: that's cybersecurity for you. </p>

            </p>
            <p id="body-66" class="transcript-paragraph">The next thing may be harder. We all do the same things. Every organization is secure in a certain way. You guys have got a router. Everywhere you go, you've got switches, you've got all the equipment. And you're probably got everything turned on. I'm sure you're logging, you're taking all your logs, and you're analyzing them and you're doing all that stuff. But at the end of the day, it's still the people that have to do that. We can't turn on the machines and just let them go. We haven't got to Skynet yet. We're not there, not into that yet. But I think if you had to put your Yoda hat on and say what's coming, I would say that the thing that we're going to see is we're going to have languages that are going to come up. We've got Python right now, it's huge in cybersecurity. Almost every security analyst has the ability to write a Python program and extract data from logs. And that's a great thing. And I think over time, you're going to see Go come up and be one of the big languages to do that same thing. Simply because it's real easy to put together. And we're going to start having what everybody euphemistically refers to as "citizen programmers". How many citizen programmers do you know that are really up on cybersecurity and how to create secure code? Or perhaps even the OWASP model, since they're probably going to take their code and put it on a web server, so everybody can see it. We've got some things that we're going to have to figure out as we go along. And yes, it is scary, but I kind of look forward to the challenge. It's like, "Alright, how can we make the world more secure? How can we keep the bad actors in place?". All comes down to literally an old Western movie, "What color's your hat today?". So we're never going to be able to keep people from doing either stupid things or illegal things. Because I think it's easier than working. It's easier than earning a buck. We might be able to convince a certain set of people that security is a real deal, and that we have to do it. And these are some good practices. So that we can create that scalable, sustainable security for every organization, even pipelines. People will watch this three year, they'll come across this three years from now, "Why do they keep talking about pipelines?</p>

            <p id="body-68" class="transcript-paragraph">Hopefully by then, we'll have a better stretch with no hacks. We'll see about that. All right, Gordon. So the episode has to come to an end. But before I let you off the hook, I wanted to ask you just one more question that typically brings out a value to our audience. If you were to pick a single item, it could be anything. It could be technical, it could be a practice, it could be a habit, it could be anything. But a single item that provided the highest return on investment for your career as a whole, what would you pick? </p>

              Gordon Rudd
            </p>
            <p id="body-69" class="transcript-paragraph">Well, I would say that the highest return on investment for my career was learning and understanding that, I don't know exactly how to say it, but I taught technology for a long, long time in post-secondary education scenarios. And I find that it's that lifelong ability to learn and to be curious and to think about things other than being stuck in that box, "Okay, this is the way we do it". That has had the biggest impact on my career. Just not being afraid to get out of the norm. One of my projects was to create, or to actually purchase a supercomputer from Japan and bring it online for giant gas company. And instead of doing that, well the IT guys that I worked with at the time, all came and said, "Hey, we don't know the language it uses, a pretrial proprietary operating system that's not really Linux or Unix or Windows or anything. So we'd have to learn a whole new operating system. We don't know anything about it, we have nothing that even looks like it. We don't really want to do it". It's like, "Well, okay, I've got a $20 million budget for a project that isn't going to go anywhere without some support". So bag in this back in the early 00s. I said, "Let's create a Beowulf cluster". Everybody looked at me like I was crazy. What's a Beowulf cluster? Well, it's just a bunch of Linux servers bolted together that hack like a supercomputer. Trust me, it'll work. So we spent a couple of weeks researching it. And we got 1024 file servers, and we got them all in racks and turned them all on and created our own version of a supercomputer. And we did it for like less than $400,000 instead of 20 million. And we were still under whatever $400,000 is, but it's that ability to think out of the box. And to understand that we're just talking about hardware and software. You can make them do anything you want them to do, you've just got to figure out what the right application is and how to make it work for your organization. So that at the end of the day, your people are going to be running whatever you're building. It better look good. It better work good. I mean, how many apps do you have on your phone? I probably got a couple 100 apps somewhere. And most of them are off in the cloud, because they won't even fit on my phone, that I've tried. And I'm sure everybody that's got a smartphone or smart tablet does the same thing. They read about an app and they go try it. And it's like, "Well, I'm not going down that rabbit hole paying more money". So we've got to make things that are really efficient, that are really human-centered. That really do make the world a little better place, every time we do it. When we started doing that, then your career is going to have a high ROI. It doesn't matter what you're in. You could be in technology, science, technology, engineering, or math. You know, it's just making sure that you learn and that you're not afraid to learn and that you're not afraid to get out of the box. And you need to understand one simple thing: it is always DNS. It's always DNS. Start there.</p>
