                Chester Santos, the international man of Memory here. Memory is a fundamental part of learning and the acquisition of knowledge. improving your memory skills can have a positive impact on multiple areas of your life. A two minute short video is going to play with some of my presentation clips. And then I'll be back with the webinar that works.

              <li>
                Chester Santos is the United States memory champion. He captured the title this past weekend in New York City. Some of his techniques stretch all the way back to the ancient Greeks. He's got the power to educate, to thrill and memorize.

              <li>
                Exercise your visualization ability, and your visual memory is incredibly powerful. If you were able to complete that simple exercise, then you have the ability to remember anything at all that you would ever want to remember quickly and easily.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 Chester Santos: When it comes to dealing with people, we are not nearly as good at remembering names. He says one way to improve your memory is to turn the name somehow into a visual. Santos: As you activate more senses in the encoding process, you are building more connections in your mind.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Use nothing but your brain and memory. I'm going to have you attempt to commit to memory the following random list of words. The key to this is to shift your approach just a little bit when it comes to any sort of memory task. Try to come at it more as a fun opportunity to use your creativity and your imagination.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                This technique is called the story method. It is just one of many techniques that memory champions like myself use to pull off extraordinary feats of memory. Your job is to simply replay through this little story that you've created in your mind. Each major object that you encounter in the story will give you the next word.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                If you will stick to this type of training with the story method and other similar types of techniques, you will notice many benefits over time. Your memory will improve because your brain is very trainable. People are losing memory ability due to becoming too dependent on electronic devices.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Research suggests that by engaging in rigorous brain exercise, you can build up what they're calling cognitive reserve. This can apply to even very complex types of information. It's about building mental note cards or mental cue cards that remind you of something more complex.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You've just memorized the top five exports of the UK. See and experience it happening in your mind as best you can. Those simple images serve as note cards, mental note cards. A little bit in terms of memory skills training will go a long way towards setting you apart.

                Remembering people's names and things about them helps you to build better business and personal relationships. If you are not remembering names or calling people by the wrong name, this can be detrimental to relationships. Here are some tips to help you get good at remembering names.
