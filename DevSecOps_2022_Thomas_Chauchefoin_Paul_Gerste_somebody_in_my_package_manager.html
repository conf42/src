<p>What is your worst supply chain nightmare, and why is it somebody breaking into the backend of a popular package manager?

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                92% of all commercial software are using open source composer. Today we're only going to focus on package managers for developers. There is another notion that needs to be known, which is something that we call supply chain. We're going to show you how to reduce the impact of these attacks in the future.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 Composer is the most popular PHP package manager. In the past years, we achieved to compromise packages twice. These are two very similar vulnerabilities in composer that we found. Even if PHP is dead, that's really not the case.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Thomas: Let's try to identify a new vulnerability in packages just for fun. Only official way to fix such vulnerabilities is to use a dash dash sequence. And is there any invocation without dash dash left that we knew could be available for argument injections?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We first reported it on April 7 at 06:00 p. m. And now we could do as interface demonstration, which is backdoor packages by modifying the JSON files of the semitad data. A few days after they assigned cv, they did not identify any trace of exploitation on the brick instance except us.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Pair is the historical package manager of the PHP ecosystem. It was created in 1999, and today it's only moderately active anymore. Some of the values are easily predictable or known by the attacker. Paul is going to guide you through similar vulnerabilities in another software package, managers for PHP.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Third demonstration of how to get a shell on the pair of server. Real interesting thing for a real attacker would now be to backdoor all the packages and then wait until people install them and install malware. If you could consider moving to composer packages, because they are also present on pair.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Who's auditing all this open source software? We do it, but we can't audit all of it. Hands code reviews take time, and they require money if you want to hire somebody to do it. Who would do it if not them?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Also, the security of clients is important. One problem is that they don't have a clear threat model. Can you trust project files or other integrations that are present in this environment? Nobody really set the threat model for this.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Could we composer a good chunk of the Internet? Yes, we could. There's always lack of maintainers and lack of security reviews. If you can audit your package managers, why not see if there's a vulnerability in there? If you find something, please report it responsibly.
              </li>
