                Matis is a software that provides you the ability to build observability for your databases. The idea is that developers often don't notice problems that later can cause troubles on the production end. We want to alert users right before they even commit the code or at latest during their CI CD pipeline.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We wanted to build an SDK per tech stack. The first approach was having SDK. The second approach was to reconfigure the database a bit. And finally, in the third approach, we wanted to utilize open telemetry much more.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The idea is to break from the database. We install an SDK to your application that stamps the query with the trace id. Another piece that reads the logs and checks for the execution plans based on particular trace ids and sends all of that to Mattis. The problems now the database must be reconfigured.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Open telemetry is a set of sdks and libraries that can be used to emit logs, traces, metrics and other pieces of information. Now the question is, how do you trigger this open telemetry? And the best is yet to come.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Can you represent your data structures the same way between languages? Do you have specific proprietary protocol support in all the languages? How do you write a documentation for different sdks in different languages? To keep it maintainable over time, you need to keep it simple.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Next thingy is version management. Do I bump their versions consistently or do I just bump the version independently? Consider sdks for all the languages as one single SDK. Be explicit about your dependencies. Run your lets constantly and have them uniform and as easy as possible.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
