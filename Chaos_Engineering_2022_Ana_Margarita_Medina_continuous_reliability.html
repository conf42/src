    <title>Conf42: Continuous Reliability. How?</title>

    <meta property="og:description" content="As engineers we expect our systems and applications to be reliable. And we often test to ensure that at a small scale or in development. But when you scale up and your infrastructure footprint increases, the assumption that conditions will remain stable is wrong. Reliability at scale does not mean eliminating failure; failure is inevitable. How can we get ahead of these failures and ensure we do it in a continuous way?  One of the ways we can go about this is by implementing solutions like CNCF's sandbox project Keptn. Keptn allows us to leverage the tooling we already use and implement pipelines where we execute chaos engineering experiments and performance testing while implementing SLOs. Ana will share how you can start simplifying cloud-native application delivery and operations with Keptn to ensure you deploy reliable applications to production."/>

            </h3>
<!-- Text -->
<p>As engineers we expect our systems and applications to be reliable. And we often test to ensure that at a small scale or in development. But when you scale up and your infrastructure footprint increases, the assumption that conditions will remain stable is wrong. Reliability at scale does not mean eliminating failure; failure is inevitable. How can we get ahead of these failures and ensure we do it in a continuous way?</p>
<p>One of the ways we can go about this is by implementing solutions like CNCF&rsquo;s sandbox project Keptn. Keptn allows us to leverage the tooling we already use and implement pipelines where we execute chaos engineering experiments and performance testing while implementing SLOs. Ana will share how you can start simplifying cloud-native application delivery and operations with Keptn to ensure you deploy reliable applications to production.</p>

                Jamaica make up real time feedback into the behavior of your distributed systems and observing changes exceptions. Errors in real time allows you to not only experiment with confidence, but respond instantly to get things working again. As our systems get more complex, that means that our failures are also more complex.

                Ana Margarita Medina is a senior chaos engineer at Grumlin. She focuses on empowering others to learn more about chaos engineering. Medina also sits on the advisory board for Captain project. Representation is something that really matters to her.

                Captain is a control plane for DevOps automation of cloud native applications. It uses a declarative approach to build scalable automation for delivery and the operations of these services. Captain is also part of the CNCF foundation and it sits in as a sandsbox project.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Service level objectives and service level indicators are key to building reliability. Captain allows for you to take these concepts known as SLOs and SLOs, and have standardization. A lot of that SRE operation work now gets to be defined and done in a way that we actually have pass and failures based on these metrics.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Captain has three stages: Development, staging and production. You can also do chaos engineering alongside performance testing. Captain allows for you to define these as their own Yaml files. This allows for continuous reliability.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We have to remember that we can't just build reliability overnight. The way to do that is by establishing processes, automating them, and continuous reliability. If you're interested in taking the next step in your learning journey, check out Gremlin certification.
