              Summary

                Daniel: Why are vectors useful? Why use them to make your app better? We'll talk about which features of your app benefit from being vector powered. And finally, you unlock the benefit for your end users, which is why we are doing this.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When humans adopted language, they kind of lost something in the process. Words are not very useful to represent information in terms of, for computers. And here is where we introduce vectors, basically because vectors give us the resolution that we need.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Before using vector representations to build search interfaces, it was all about keywords. Now, how is this looking in the recommendation side of the problem? This is kind of two sides of the same coin. We get recommendations wrong, same as the search.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The purpose of the nearest neighbor index is to help us find similar pictures or similar vectors in the space really fast. Technology is maturing that can store a bunch of vectors on each node. Production builders are interested in building on top of the vector databases.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Right now there is this explosion of different vector databases. When you choose a vector database, I wouldn't focus so much on the speed. What you care about in surgeon recommendations use cases is recall around 80, 90%.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The idea is to represent your content and users as vectors and then do a vector search that basically for a given user finds the nearest content. The new thing with vectors is that you can take all these features and literally just concatenate them into the content vector. This allows you to do cool stuff later.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                And then other aspect of this is, let's say you want to improve the diversity of authors for the content that you recommend. And for that, again, the query manager on top of your vector based retrieval is useful. And then finally it's an approximate system, it's approximate nearest neighbor retrieval.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We want to build a vector powered system. What will you need to add to this to build an MVP? The first step will be just eyeballing the results. The second step is kind of quantitative evaluation. And then finally, probably the most importantly, the analytics.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The next stage is where this all gets very complicated, right? Because you are now assembling all those different constraints. You'll need a sort of a serving system that has APIs. And then through an API layer again, you surface it into your product search recommendations.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The touch point between what we talked about before, vector representations of data and generative AI is this aspect of memory. There are libraries that are useful for working with, building on top of Generative AI use cases.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Today we looked at the connection of vector embeddings and generative AI. We are building a vector ops platform that makes building surgeon recommendations easier. We would love to learn from each other and deliver something useful. Connect on LinkedIn and take it from there.
