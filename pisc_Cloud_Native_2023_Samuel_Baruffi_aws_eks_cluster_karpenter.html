              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Today we are going to be discussing about Carpenter. Nodes for any EKS cluster auto scaling with Carpenter. The name of my presentation is just in time.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                What is EKS elastic Kubernetes services on AWS? Carpenter actually works on top of eks. After that we're going to talk about kubernetes auto scaling. And in the end we spend probably 1015 minutes doing a demo.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                EKS is short for elastic Kubernetes service. It's a managed service on AWS. EKS provides an experience for reliability, security, availability and performance. For doing know lifecycle management, scaling, those are actually going to be responsible for you behind the scenes.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Kubernetes autoscaling focuses on the application itself and the other one is the nodes and the infrastructure. Customers are moving for a variety of different workloads. And that's where some challenges come into the picture.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You can reschedule running pods onto existing clusters that are underutilized. You can also launch new more cost efficiency nodes within the cluster. consolidation doesn't ever bring your application down, but that actually optimize capacity quite a lot.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Carpenter works by looking for pending pods and grouping those pending pods. Instead of talking to Karpenter, carpenter talks to EC two fleet instance. This can shave seconds off nodes per node startup latency.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You can create multiple provisioning with different weights or you want to match your specific pod to a specific provisioner. You can also restrict instance selection by diversification across different configurations. If you're looking to implement Karpenter, you should be familiar with and or at least evaluate.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Karpenter is a tool that allows you to scale up and scale down applications on easy to instances on your AWS account. The demo shows in real time what is the currently state of my eks cluster. Only one pod is responsible for making those decisions and making the scaling actions.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The other object has deployed is called the AWS node template. This is responsible for telling a carpenter how do you actually deploy new instances. What I want to do here is scale this up for us.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So I'm going to enable consolidation. What I want to do now is deploy three replicas of my inflate application. Before it's even ready on the Kubernetes, Carpenter is already making all the work behind the scenes. It's taking a few minutes to create a new instance.
              </li>
