              <li>
                Tanya Jenka: To me, Devsecops is Appsec plus DevOps. She wants to talk about the three ways of DevOps and how we weave security through them. She says there's so much more than just a pipeline.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Tanya Shex Purple is head of community and education at Semgrap. She founded a small company called Wehack Purple that did security training in Canada. She is on year 27 of her journey in tech. Here she talks about her ideas of securing DevOps.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A CI CD stands for continuous integration, continuous delivery, and sometimes continuous deployment. What it does is it puts all the pieces together and automates it. These tools help us do our jobs better.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Application security is a subfield within computer science. It's appsec, but adjusted to work nicely in an appsec environment or a DevOps environment. This is kind of like my passion. I talk about it all the time.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                And so this brings us to the three ways of DevOps. The three ways emphasize the efficiency of the entire system, not just your part. It's basically learning, experimenting, and then doing better.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Pipelines are part of the ways of DevOps number one and number two. But if you put every single thing into the pipeline, your developers will not want to be friends with you anymore. There's so much more to appsec than that.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The first goal of lots and lots of appsec programs is inventory. You can't protect the APIs, the apps, the SaaS if you don't know you have them. Knowledge is the third way of DevOps, through and through. We're talking about continuous learning.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Having a set of standardized security requirements for software projects. Or do threat modeling in the design phase or doing a pen test in the testing phase. There's so many different security activities that you can add to your system development lifecycle. Tools that work outside the pipeline can be very effective.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's so much you can do with an incident response team that's really important for any information security program. Another thing, metrics. I am a huge fan of basing our programs at work and at home based on data. We can continually improve our program based on metric experimentation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We should think outside the box and do appsec in many ways, not just one way. Appsec is not a tool that you can buy. It's not a button you can press. If you want sense, and DevOps is more than just pipelines.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You can join the Wehack Purple community. Every Monday on Twitter, on Blue sky, and on Mastodon, on the infosec exchange server, I run a mentoring matching program. Use this hashtag on Mondays, tag me and I'll retweet you to the whole world. Let me help you find a mentor.
