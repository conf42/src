    <meta property="og:description" content="Kubernetes makes it possible to run containerized application at scale. It solves many problems of microservice architecture by abstracting away things like container deployment, container-to-container communication, load balancing. While Kubernetes is great at it many things, it seems to be lacking in terms of security. It has some security features but in most respect it is not production grade security, at least not by default.  If you are thinking about or already started with Kubernetes for your production workload, there are some steps you could follow to make sure your environments sand applications is secure.   In this talk we will discuss some best practices for Kubernetes security. From container image to secret management, we will try to cover it all. And after this talk hopefully we will all be in a better position to harden and secure our Kubernetes cluster."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>Kubernetes makes it possible to run containerized application at scale. It solves many problems of microservice architecture by abstracting away things like container deployment, container-to-container communication, load balancing. While Kubernetes is great at it many things, it seems to be lacking in terms of security. It has some security features but in most respect it is not production grade security, at least not by default.</p>
<p>If you are thinking about or already started with Kubernetes for your production workload, there are some steps you could follow to make sure your environments sand applications is secure. </p>
<p>In this talk we will discuss some best practices for Kubernetes security. From container image to secret management, we will try to cover it all. And after this talk hopefully we will all be in a better position to harden and secure our Kubernetes cluster.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                The goal of this talk is to start our security journey in kubernetes. This is not an in depth tutorial on how to secure your Kubernetes cluster. The slides to this talk are in this link at tiny cc k eight s security.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Are computers less secure than real life? Security is a spectrum. Things can be more secure or less secure. The moment your application touches the Internet, everything on the Internet is trying to attack it and exploit it. We're going to talk about security in Kubernetes context.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 Kubernetes security has few different aspects to it. For application security use best practices for application security. It depends on the application you're writing, the runtime you're using. But again, try to use the best practices.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Golang latest is a terrible image tag to use because that latest keeps changing with every new version that comes around. The best way to lock down version is by using digest Sha. Next is limited attack vector. Try to use smaller base images.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                For image security, the best practice here is least privileged access. If your user doesn't need to be root, make sure you're never root. Always use some user creation within the container image so that you're running as user 5000.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Don't expose underlying infrastructure. Metadata is more valuable than you think. Make sure your node underlying infrastructure itself is following the best security policies. Update regularly. Just by not fixing the zero day vulnerabilities you're just opening yourself up for attacks.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 Kubernetes is environments for microservice applications. You have to be very careful about making sure your network security is up to date. Using resource code can help limit attack surface and damage.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Always be careful with your tools. Most of them are open source. There are some paid products. None of these listed here are like, and they are not listed in a particular order. Don't take this listing as any recommendation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are a number of image scanning tools both in open source and paid. You can use both dockle and trivia in your CI and in their documentation. If you see any of the fatal errors you could stop your CI build and fail the CI build.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                For runtime security in Kubernetes what we are talking about is your cluster is ready. Falco is asysdig project. They monitor the cluster real time. SC, Linux and Seccomp to make sure that you are limiting the amount of things a container could do within the cluster.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                For network security there are a bunch of network overlays in Kubernetes. You can make use of the particular network policy rules from your provider to make sure that your cluster network policy is really secure. Open policy agent is probably one of the best tool that is out there for auditing your running Kuubernetes cluster deployment.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Most of them are open source, but some are tied to some bigger commercial offering. Just because something has more capability, that doesn't necessarily mean they are better or worse than the other tools. I would implore you to kind of do your own exploration, try them out, use the trial and see which application here fits your need the most.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Service meshes control and monitor service traffic. They are invisible to dev team, which is a great thing. It also lets transparent monitoring of network traffic. Security is a spectrum. Nothing is like secure. It could be more secure or less secure. Go out there and secure your kubernetes and your applications.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
