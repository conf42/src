              <li>
                As with every database, we have like three different groups of problems. First group is code changes. Second area is schema changes. Third area is query changes. There are many things that can change outside of the query. This query may start running completely differently, which leads to lower performance.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The first thing is we have slow queries. Because it uses so many tables, it exponentially increases the number of rows it extracts from the database and how long it takes to process all of them. But it's only when we go to production that's one of the issues we may have with databases.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Another problem we may see is let's say that we refactor the code to make it more readable and we break the performance. Yet another issue is changes in schema. Those migrations can kill your performance and take your business down for some prolonged time.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Changing column types is yet another issue you may face when you change the column type. Other thing with schema migrations is missing indexes. You have an index that increases performance for reading but kills the performance for writing and updating. Bugs, obviously some of them will capture with our unit tests. Some of them we won't.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Other problems that orms introduce are around polymorphism and generally impedance mismatch. Unit tests and integration tests are going to be green, but we will hit errors when we go to production. Orms and databases in general are hard because changes are scattered in various places.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are open source standardized solutions for capturing the telemetry. Once we capture signals from everywhere, we can say that we have visibility. Then we can start building the APM application performance management. Observability lets you connect the dots from like CI, CD, from your application code.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Matis lets you see the stuff and protects you from breaking your production. Prevent bad code from reaching production and push all your checks to the left as early as possible. Monitor your solution constantly to understand what is going on. Finally troubleshoot all of that automatically to give you the big picture.
