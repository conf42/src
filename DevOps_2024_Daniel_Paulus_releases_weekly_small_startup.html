<p>As a technical leader, I think the DORA metrics are very relevant as a tool to guide my actions. I decided to take my team from manual, error-prone, quarterly releases to stable weekly deploys in weeks rather than months. Let me show you how I did it and increased dev velocity by 70% along the way</p>

                Daniel: Going from quarterly releases to weekly in a small startup company. Daniel: I use the dorometrics as an engineering leader to make engineering decisions. He says metrics encompass DevOps maturity quite well and can be used as a tool to assess yourself and know where to go.

                Concrete steps to take tech easy include convincing developers to build CI pipelines on GitHub. Use synthetic monitoring to get you out of firefighting. Simplify, simplify, simplify and again, simplify. Carelessly introduced complexity is the root of all evil.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                And this is hard. How do you get bite in from people. Share past experiences of your own. Build confidence through renowned material like the Google DevOps blog. Lead by example. And then once they learn what the vision is, you give them back the control.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Concrete steps to take process hard, move to trunk based development. Have prs and code review, merge to main and keep it stable at all times. Rollback fast if needed. Fix bugs offline.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The question is how much should we deploy and how frequent? That depends on where you are in, right. If you're coming from a very low DevOps maturity space, weekly deploys are actually perfectly fine. Investing into DevOps is also opportunity cost.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The next step that you could take is organizational change. You need to have stream aligned cross functional teams who can deliver themselves. Test automation and exploratory testing is important. If you are interested to nerd out about synthetic monitoring or all things DevOps, come seek me out in the czech slack community.
