              Summary

              <li>
                Open telemetry is an incubating project in CNCF landscape. It provides a set of APIs, libraries, integrations to connect the telemetry from across your system and services. With open telemetry, you are free to choose where you want to store your telemetry. There is a strong interest in modern observability.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Open telemetry protocol is used to send all the telemetry that is collected from your applications, infrastructure or services to the choice of your back end. The easiest option to get started with open telemetry is automatic instrumentation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Once we start utilizing our wrapper with our node application. We can capture the metrics from the start of our application. All these attributes are being captured by SDK using the automatic instrumentation. The SDK prints out the debug logs for all of the requests that are coming in.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Let me click on my services and my service convert 42 hotel is already available here. Some metrics are already coming in. I'll quickly just switch to distributed tracing to look at the rest APIs and the traces and analyze them. Neuralink helps us get to the point quickly.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We have set our tracing for unreal application using the automatic instrumentation trace provider. Once you have identified the areas, or once you know what areas you want to instrument, you can use the manual instrumentation and customize your error message. Once we have all this information, it becomes easier for us to triage and understand the behavior of our application.

                Open industry provides us with packages to help us capture the metrics from our applications. In this part, we'll focus on configuring our metrics and extracting the metrics of our application. Since meter can become too aggressive and EW cpu cycles, it is recommended that you configure it and tune it as per your requirements.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                For the logs we focus mainly on the API logs, SDK and another package which is SDK logs. Using this package, we'll transform our logs into standard open dimension format. Any customization that you want to add to your log record with open telemetry and bernouin you can do so here.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Beauty of all of this setting up logs and traces and metrics comes into picture. Having the right context is very important. The trace cycle and logs thus operate can help you avoid pointing fingers to dev or ops. Also helps you reach to the root cause of your application problem very quickly.

                Open telemetry collector is a very important piece of open elementary. It helps you capture information from your infrastructure as well as your microservices and different applications. The collector is built with three different components, receivers, processors and exporters. You can get started with collector by running it simply in a docker container.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Open elementary is growing and being adopted at a very rapid pace. Start with automatic instrumentation and then advance towards manual instrumentation. There is a lot of active investment going on with open telemetry. It helps engineers work based on data and not opinion.
