    <meta property="og:description" content="#### Securing fast-growing companies, is difficult to do. Very difficult to do well. This session will give attendees key performance indicators to describe the relationship between each area of excellence and the scalability, sustainability and flexibility required in a cybersecurity program/department.    ---  This session will focus on how corporate size and growth rate actually dictate cybersecurity methodology, strategy and operations.  Setup and maintenance of CyberOps is very different for these companies. IT and Cybersecurity operate in hybrid models, focused on five areas. Successful information security teams must understand each of these areas and their operation to succeed."/>

<h4>Securing fast-growing companies, is difficult to do. Very difficult to do well. This session will give attendees key performance indicators to describe the relationship between each area of excellence and the scalability, sustainability and flexibility required in a cybersecurity program/department.</h4>
<hr />
<p>This session will focus on how corporate size and growth rate actually dictate cybersecurity methodology, strategy and operations.  Setup and maintenance of CyberOps is very different for these companies. IT and Cybersecurity operate in hybrid models, focused on five areas. Successful information security teams must understand each of these areas and their operation to succeed.</p>

                Gordon Rudd is speaking at Python 2021, a conference on cybersecurity. He talks about creating scalable and sustainable cybersecurity for any size organization. When you're going to create something, it's probably going to be in Python.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cybersecurity today, simply put, is a team sport. Successfully communicating with your governance risk committee teams, your C suite and your board also a critical function of cybersecurity. Scalability is directly equatable to economic flexibility. The first milestone that I always ask everybody for is your security education, training and awareness program.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                As a CISo, you have to identify your stakeholders, and you're going to have to understand your numbers. Every program has projects, processes, procedures, and people. Your business continuity and disaster recovery plans are mission critical.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Every cybersecurity program needs to know what threats areas in the wild. The third layer in any model is encryption. Make sure you understand your backup, whether it's towers of Hanoi or mix and match. One size doesn't fit all.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The economics, the talent, the existing equipment, and the function. Are you doing anything that's going to securing your wide area network or your routers? Could be trouble if you don't have the right security in place.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cybersecurity expert: Make sure all of our intellectual property is secured. Use behavior analytics to determine what Mary and John and Joe are doing on our network. There is a chain of custody that must be maintained with any forensic analysis. Nothing's foolproof, but users do make mistakes.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In cybersecurity, it's very important that we report our activities and we report what's going on. We're going to report to the board quarterly, at least if not monthly, to a committee of the board. Key stakeholders, the people that are heads of lines of business or department heads, must be critically informed on cybersecurity.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Every organization should have a risk appetite statement. Use a framework, and there are many to choose from. The things that we're going to assess are going to be our people, our processes and our technology. You want to make sure that your quantitative management capability is intact.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The other things you want to do is to understand the skill level of people in your department, especially within cybersecurity. You want to make sure that you understand how to close a project. For the cyber people in the tool set, always good governance.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                GRC, you want to have at least a monthly governance risk compliance meeting, your framework adjustments every twelve to 18 months. Your risk assessments need to be done annually. It's absolutely critical for our web application development. Everything's getting a web interface patches.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The other thing I want to make sure you understand is your cybersecurity roadmap. Number one thing to have in place, because cybersecurity is a team sport. Your EIQ, your emotional intelligence quotient, mission critical. If you can't control your emotions, you're worthless in a corporate environment.
              </li>
