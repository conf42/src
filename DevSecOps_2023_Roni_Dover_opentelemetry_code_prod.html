              <li>
                Conference 42 talk on continuous feedback and opentelemetry. What happens after you deploy to production? Development is supposed to be nonlinear. How are we improving on actually analyzing what the code does?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's so many observability systems and so many instances where I've seen developers are reaping none of those benefits at all. For some organizations, for some engineers, the point of observability is to create dashboards or to support production monitoring. We have this hole in the middle of our DevOps loop that is causing all of these different symptoms.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Opentelemetry is the merging together of two standards, open census and Opentrace. Never before has there been such a gold standard for observability. The minute you activate open telemetry, you already have access to a lot of data. Having too much data is an easier problem to solve.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Traces are essentially an anatomy of a request. They tell us what our code is doing. Everything that will be on this talk will be either open source or free tooling. Enabling instrumentation is very easy.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So let's take a look at some code to demonstrate how we can really do this feat or manage this feat of actually using observability when we code. I've opened a familiar project for every Java developer out there called the Pet Clinic project. In the background, I was running open telemetry in the background.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A closer inspection of the anatomy of a request or what is happening when my code gets handled shows me that there were a lot of issues just hiding behind the scenes. They're not very complex, and you can detect them just by looking at a single trace. The name of this methodology is continuous feedback.

                Digma collects open telemetry data and analyze it and then show it back to you based on the analysis that it performs. Instead of looking at or sifting through a lot of traces and logs and metrics, we're doing that automatically in bringing that data to us. The project is still under development and would benefit from developer feedback.
