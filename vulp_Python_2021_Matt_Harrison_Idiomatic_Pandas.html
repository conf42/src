So again, I can look at some of the integer columns here.", "timestamp": "00:02:48,772", "timestamp_s": 168.0}, {"text": "So I\u0027m going two, use the select dtypes, pass an int into it, and then", "timestamp": "00:02:51,508", "timestamp_s": 171.0}, {"text": "chain that with the described method here.

So you\u0027ll", "timestamp": "00:03:21,668", "timestamp_s": 201.0}, {"text": "see throughout the course today that I do a lot of this chaining. And I", "timestamp": "00:03:24,458", "timestamp_s": 204.0}, {"text": "just think it makes it easier to read. So you can see, first I\u0027m going", "timestamp": "00:03:27,828", "timestamp_s": 207.0}, {"text": "to take the autos, then I\u0027m going to pull off the columns and I\u0027m going", "timestamp": "00:03:30,244", "timestamp_s": 210.0}, {"text": "to select the dtypes.

So there are other types in", "timestamp": "00:03:48,412", "timestamp_s": 228.0}, {"text": "here. Let\u0027s just show some of them. For example, this one down here can int", "timestamp": "00:03:51,388", "timestamp_s": 231.0}, {"text": "eight. If you use that type, you can go from negative 128 to 127.", "timestamp": "00:03:54,636", "timestamp_s": 234.0}, {"text": "So if we look at our values here, for example highway mileage, we might get", "timestamp": "00:03:58,252", "timestamp_s": 238.0}, {"text": "away with using this int eight. There\u0027s also an int 16 here. An int 16", "timestamp": "00:04:01,724", "timestamp_s": 241.0}, {"text": "goes up to 32,000. So it looks like all of our values there would support", "timestamp": "00:04:05,426", "timestamp_s": 245.0}, {"text": "being changed to int 16 instead. So what we can do is we can", "timestamp": "00:04:08,652", "timestamp_s": 248.0}, {"text": "stick in this as type call here into our chain.", "timestamp": "00:04:12,196", "timestamp_s": 252.0}, {"text": "And then in select dtypes we\u0027ll just select int and int", "timestamp": "00:04:15,978", "timestamp_s": 255.0}, {"text": "eight. And you can see that this is now showing us what is either an", "timestamp": "00:04:19,396", "timestamp_s": 259.0}, {"text": "int or an int eight. It\u0027s not showing us the int 16 there,", "timestamp": "00:04:22,164", "timestamp_s": 262.0}, {"text": "but we did. Okay. And so if you\u0027re not familiar with this as", "timestamp": "00:04:25,252", "timestamp_s": 265.0}, {"text": "type, what this is doing. Here\u0027s the documentation. Basically you can pass in", "timestamp": "00:04:28,552", "timestamp_s": 268.0}, {"text": "this dtype here or you can pass in a dictionary of types.", "timestamp": "00:04:32,248", "timestamp_s": 272.0}, {"text": "So what we\u0027re doing above with this as type is we\u0027re passing in a dictionary", "timestamp": "00:04:35,534", "timestamp_s": 275.0}, {"text": "with the columns and the types that we want those columns to be. So you", "timestamp": "00:04:38,622", "timestamp_s": 278.0}, {"text": "can see that highway. We\u0027re casting that to an int eight city and", "timestamp": "00:04:40,924", "timestamp_s": 280.0}, {"text": "combined eight. We\u0027re casting those or we\u0027re changing those to int", "timestamp": "00:04:44,540", "timestamp_s": 284.0}, {"text": "16s. That\u0027s why city and int city and", "timestamp": "00:04:47,852", "timestamp_s": 287.0}, {"text": "combined don\u0027t show up in this. Because when we said select dtypes, we did not", "timestamp": "00:04:51,068", "timestamp_s": 291.0}, {"text": "select the int 16 dtype. Okay, so here I\u0027m just flushing", "timestamp": "00:04:53,792", "timestamp_s": 293.0}, {"text": "this out a little bit more. I\u0027m filling in range and year as well.", "timestamp": "00:04:57,254", "timestamp_s": 297.0}, {"text": "Note that I\u0027m saying now select dtypes with the string integer. And if we do", "timestamp": "00:05:01,104", "timestamp_s": 301.0}, {"text": "that, this is going to pull off anything that\u0027s integer esque. And so it will", "timestamp": "00:05:04,608", "timestamp_s": 304.0}, {"text": "get all those types in there. This is looking okay. We haven\u0027t lost any precision", "timestamp": "00:05:07,828", "timestamp_s": 307.0}, {"text": "by casting our integer columns to these other columns. We still have the same values", "timestamp": "00:05:10,858", "timestamp_s": 310.0}, {"text": "in them. But now we should be using a lot less memory to do that.", "timestamp": "00:05:13,978", "timestamp_s": 313.0}, {"text": "Let\u0027s just look at the memory here. And now we\u0027re using 18 instead of 19.", "timestamp": "00:05:16,996", "timestamp_s": 316.0}, {"text": "So we\u0027ve got a little bit of savings in that. Let\u0027s look at floating point", "timestamp": "00:05:20,298", "timestamp_s": 320.0}, {"text": "numbers. So I\u0027m going to say, let\u0027s describe what\u0027s a float and", "timestamp": "00:05:22,932", "timestamp_s": 322.0}, {"text": "we\u0027ve got cylinders and displacement in there. So I\u0027m", "timestamp": "00:05:26,108", "timestamp_s": 326.0}, {"text": "going to jump into cylinders. One thing that strikes out at me as I look", "timestamp": "00:05:29,324", "timestamp_s": 329.0}, {"text": "at this is that cylinders actually looks integer. Like, if you look at the values", "timestamp": "00:05:31,804", "timestamp_s": 331.0}, {"text": "that came up there, those look very integer esque. What I\u0027m going to do is", "timestamp": "00:05:34,754", "timestamp_s": 334.0}, {"text": "just stick a describe on here to look at cylinders. And this is confirming my", "timestamp": "00:05:37,468", "timestamp_s": 337.0}, {"text": "suspicion that we have the mins and the quartiles there that are all whole numbers.", "timestamp": "00:05:41,020", "timestamp_s": 341.0}, {"text": "So why is that being represented as can float instead of an", "timestamp": "00:05:44,972", "timestamp_s": 344.0}, {"text": "integer?

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Matt Harrison: We're going to be talking about idiomatic pandas. He runs a company that does corporate training and consulting in python and data science. We'll talk about using the correct types for your data. And talk about some ways that you can make your pandas code better.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Getting the right types in pandas can be a challenge. But if you can do that, it's going to save you memory. It's also going to make your code easier to work with and it can save you computation time as well.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In pandas, there is 206 entries here where the cylinders are missing. This is because the lowercase int 64 type does not have support for missing numbers. Pandas also allows you to stick python objects into each cell there. This saves a lot more memory.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 drive engine description, make, model, transmission and created on. An object represents string data, though it could also represent numeric data. If we convert them to categorical types, we can be able to do date operations on them.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Categoricals are a way to save a lot of memory in pandas. In order to use pandas, you need to be able to load your data in memory. Using the right types can allow you to process more data.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Jupyter makes it really nice to do that. I like to make a function that will take my raw data that ive read directly out of a CSV file. One thing that sticks out is whether it's automatic or manual. We've almost halved our memory by doing these little operations here.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In pandas, pandas generally does not mutate data. Rather it returns new data frames. Call pipe is a nice way to inline any arbitrary code. Chain programming is easy to read and easy to debug.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In place rarely actually does something in place. You are thinking you're saving memory, but you're not. Pandas is not really doing an in place operation, even though it says it is. It also prohibits this chaining, which I think is going to really mess up your code.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The next section is don't apply if you can. In this case, because it's working with strings instead of numbers, it's going to be slower. Don't use it unless you're in a string situation. And avoid apply if possible.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 Pandas has two ways to do this. One is with a group by and then I'm going to take the mean here. This visualization tells me a lot more to me. Why was there an inflection point around 2007 eight that made things start ticking up.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Don't mutate. Apply is generally your enemy, so if you're trying to do math operations with apply, you're probably doing it the wrong way. Aggregations are very powerful. If you use this chain style and start building them up, it's going to help you understand what's going on.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                I hope you enjoyed this. If you want two learn more about pandas, you can follow me on Twitter. I also have a discount code to my pandas. Course it's going to be 50% off for people who are watching this.
