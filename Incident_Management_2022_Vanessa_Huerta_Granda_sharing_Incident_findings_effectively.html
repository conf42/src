    <meta property="og:description" content="One more step in Learning from Incidents: Sharing incident findings effectively Oftentimes post-incident activities involve a post-mortem meeting and document. These 2 vary in quality, from focusing only on a single root cause, maybe a 5-why’s, or on the bright side, a thorough investigation that takes into account multiple points of view. Regardless, once the meeting is complete, the output usually ends up in a document hidden in a drive that no-one ever opens and the knowledge that was discovered during the postmortem stays only with those who attended the meeting.  If learning from incidents allows us to turn outages into opportunities, how can we make those learnings reach the most people? We do this by carefully and thoughtfully sharing our findings.   By sharing our findings we allow for more equitable learning (account for people with conflicts or illnesses who couldn’t attend the review meeting), can get buy-in for next steps, get people in the org to have a more well-rounded knowledge of how things work.  This talk is meant for anyone who is involved in incidents in any way: responders, subject matter experts, impacted users, and facilitators but mostly for technologists who want to make the most out of their incidents through learning!  Throughout this talk I will give an overview of why sharing matters and go deep through the different ways that we can share incident learnings depending on your needs and audiences as well as provide examples with the hope that folks are able to start applying these forms of communication in their own orgs. Furthermore, I want folks who watch this talk to leave with a sense that change can happen and that we aren’t meant to keep repeating the same problems over and over again.  "/>

<p>One more step in Learning from Incidents: Sharing incident findings effectively
Oftentimes post-incident activities involve a post-mortem meeting and document. These 2 vary in quality, from focusing only on a single root cause, maybe a 5-why’s, or on the bright side, a thorough investigation that takes into account multiple points of view. Regardless, once the meeting is complete, the output usually ends up in a document hidden in a drive that no-one ever opens and the knowledge that was discovered during the postmortem stays only with those who attended the meeting.</p>
<p>If learning from incidents allows us to turn outages into opportunities, how can we make those learnings reach the most people? We do this by carefully and thoughtfully sharing our findings. </p>
<p>By sharing our findings we allow for more equitable learning (account for people with conflicts or illnesses who couldn’t attend the review meeting), can get buy-in for next steps, get people in the org to have a more well-rounded knowledge of how things work.</p>
<p>This talk is meant for anyone who is involved in incidents in any way: responders, subject matter experts, impacted users, and facilitators but mostly for technologists who want to make the most out of their incidents through learning!</p>
<p>Throughout this talk I will give an overview of why sharing matters and go deep through the different ways that we can share incident learnings depending on your needs and audiences as well as provide examples with the hope that folks are able to start applying these forms of communication in their own orgs. Furthermore, I want folks who watch this talk to leave with a sense that change can happen and that we aren’t meant to keep repeating the same problems over and over again. </p>

              Summary

            <ul>
              
              <li>
                We started focusing on not only learning from our incidents, but telling others about them. And then something magical happened. Folks started listening, and they engaged with what we were talking about. Little by little, our recommendations were making it into the quarterly plans.

              <li>
                Vanessa Huerta Granda talks about sharing incident findings effectively. She believes learning from incidents is the key that can help software organizations improve how we do our work. She wants to make this work more attainable and sustainable to the everyday engineering.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Last year, Jelly released a guide on how to learn from incidents. The guide explains that your work should not be completed to be filed. It should be completed so it can be read and shared across the business. Sharing timely information is also sort of marketing for the work that we do.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So going back to incidents who arent the different audiences. Within these different audiences, folks can have different purposes for wanting or needing to see the learnings from an incident. The way that you share the information with them will be different.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                With all of this in mind, let's take a look at the different formats in which you can share the information. We want to make it easy for people to share their learnings. So you'll see how we do that in the next few slides.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The report is focused on telling the bigger story of what happened. The abstract is your incidents elevator pitch. The next format is to share a recording of the actual review call. Finally, a weekly update consists of all the incidents that were analyzed that week.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When it comes to incidents, I'm a fan of focusing on learning rather than having a post mortem that then becomes an action steps factory. The difference between this and an action item factory is that you're giving yourself and other folks the time to truly understand the learnings.
              </li>
