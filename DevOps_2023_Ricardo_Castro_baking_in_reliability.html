    <meta property="og:description" content="If you were tasked with implementing “reliability engineering” how would you approach? The last few years saw a log of interest in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). Ever since Google publish the first SRE book ([https://sre.google/books/](https://sre.google/books/)) there was an “explosion” in the interest on the subject. Many saw it as an approach to implement DevOps. Others said it was a DevOps evolution. Regardless, SRE is here to stay. Moreover, reliability is here to stay. But if you were tasked with implementing “reliability engineering” how would you approach? What would would be the steps you would take into achieving that audacious goal, both cultural and technical? That’s precisely what we’ll explore in this talk. We’ll talk about practical advice on how to get started but also algo to get the ball rolling. We’ll discuss culture and tech and how they have to work together if you wish to prioritize reliability engineering."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>If you were tasked with implementing “reliability engineering” how would you approach?
The last few years saw a log of interest in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). Ever since Google publish the first SRE book (<a href="https://sre.google/books/">https://sre.google/books/</a>) there was an “explosion” in the interest on the subject. Many saw it as an approach to implement DevOps. Others said it was a DevOps evolution. Regardless, SRE is here to stay. Moreover, reliability is here to stay.
But if you were tasked with implementing “reliability engineering” how would you approach? What would would be the steps you would take into achieving that audacious goal, both cultural and technical? That’s precisely what we’ll explore in this talk. We’ll talk about practical advice on how to get started but also algo to get the ball rolling. We’ll discuss culture and tech and how they have to work together if you wish to prioritize reliability engineering.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                My talk is at Conf 42, DevOps 2023 about baking in reliability. We're basically going to cover how you can start and keep the ball running. At the end we're going to do a quick recap of what we learned today.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In 2016, Google came out with this book about site reliability engineering. It described the was that Google did operations. Many organizations still struggle to implement what DevOps is. It's sometimes hard to make that transition from the way that Google does things to our reality.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The first thing that I do is ask this set of questions. I want to understand people's expectations and what they think that reliability means to them. By having that sense, we can approach the way that we implement reliability engineering in different ways.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Don't be afraid to ask questions, no matter how stupid they might seem. The second tip is to expose yourself. You want to gain knowledge by the experience of others, but you also want to build empathy. These tips will help you progress a lot when you're starting your practice.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Another important aspect when starting a reliability engineering practice is to make yourself available. Also important is to communicate extensively. Everyone should contribute to the reliability efforts in the thing in the company. Finding your niche is especially important when you're starting out.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                It's very helpful to have a reliability framework. It will create a shared language to talk about reliability between teams. As with any practice, having executive support can be very beneficial. Very important for reliability engineering is to invest in observability.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We talked about why there's a sudden interest in reliability engineering and SRE in particular. And then we went through some useful tips, things that I usually do on a daily basis to help me do this reliability work regularly. These tips could be a presentation on its own.
