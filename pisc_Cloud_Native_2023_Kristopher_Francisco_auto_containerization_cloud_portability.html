              <li>
                42 Cloud Native 2023 will talk about how to automate any software from its source environment over to the destination in a matter of minutes. With Aibased containerization, we're able to ensure that we get the most native artifact in the destination. We'll finish off with a couple of scalability patterns.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We're really excited that we were able to introduce the first containerization capability in 2016. We really created the capability to move software into this artifact in a very native way. And really what this means is that for the ecosystem, we're able to really accelerate the rate at which software can reach these cloud data formats.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                BCD is binary configuration data, and what this framework really says is that if we can look at a software artifact in its source environment and put any component into either binary configuration or data. This can make that software artifact more portable across the cloud. We'll talk through how you can better containers your software.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Clive Andor: The first step is to understand where our software begins and ends. Once we understand the application and its inter and intra dependencies, we are able to now create the container artifact. And in doing so, again, we can run in any cloud environment. Clive: We're super excited that the 99 percentile of software has worked.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We want to delve deeper into the container manifest, and we're going to do that with an in house developed software. For multiple environments we may need to create separate configuration. Understanding that relationship will ensure that when we scale specific instances or components, that we're scaling for that capability.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 networking Andor security will be the biggest blocker. Typically the easiest way to do that is by understanding how it works in a destination environment. OS and software modernization are key parts of digital transformation. Being able to achieve that capability at scale is very important.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Last but not least, let's talk about some of the scalability patterns that exist for when we move our software into the destination artifact. These types of capabilities are very important to accelerating the rate at which we can leverage software in distributed environments such as the edge.
