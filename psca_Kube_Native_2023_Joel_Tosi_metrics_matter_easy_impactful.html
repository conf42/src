<p>Metrics are the bane of many organizations, getting fascinated on measurements that don&rsquo;t matter or can drive improper behaviours.
In this session, we walk through a simple grouping for metrics where the groupings not only call out the metrics, but their limits, and help guide to better metrics.</p>

              <li>
                Joel Tosi: I was tired of being the person that said all metrics were bad. People want metrics. They want to know if they're making good investments. We need to be able to guide better metrics for organizations.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When we commit to an idea, we want to minimize variability and deliver quickly. We have to be careful that we don't suboptimize the system at the cost of the whole. For quick groupings for organizations I work with, I want them to know where they're at.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Talk about simple metrics. This is where a lot of organizations, if they don't have metrics at all, this could be a good place to start. If you're in the simple space, getting to directional is better. These are impactful and economic metrics.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Walter Schuert came up with a way, using statistics, to distinguish between common cause variation and special cause variation. If you make a change, you would use Schuer charts to say if your change actually made a difference. To move from simple and directional to impactful require new thinking.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Many organizations want more predictability, but they don't monitor their variability. When you have high variability, predictability is out the window. Variability also leads to large queue times, people and teams waiting. The root of the problem is the variability.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Another area I work with extensively and do a lot of research lately on is this idea of cognitive load. Many, many teams have too much cognitive to load. Getting better context closer to the team, closer to where the work is done, is the solution.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                And lastly, I spend a lot of my time looking at social learning. By supporting social learning, we actually lower the dependency upon team members. The whole team learns together across skills and across contexts. And really look, metrics are always going to improve.
              </li>
