              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Danica Fine is a developer advocate for confluent. She wanted to build a system to monitor her house plants. She used Apache Kafka and a raspberry PI to create a practical, event driven pipeline. At the end of the app, users would receive an alert on their phone.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform. To use Kafka successfully, you really need to start thinking in events. It's going to help you increase the accuracy of your data and your results. Depending on which technology you use for stream processing, you can increase the resiliency of your overall system.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When data is consumed from a Kafka topic, it doesn't disappear. Instead, you should really be thinking of a kafka topic as a log. These partitions are stored across different nodes in the cluster. This is to provide better resilience and also facilitate the replication of your data.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                For this component, for my Kafka cluster, I decided to use confluent. It offers Kafka fully managed in the cloud. If you want to follow along and build something similar, just know that you need Kafka running somewhere.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The Raspberry PI connects to capacitive moisture sensors. Components communicate over a unique address which is set at the component level. You can use the producer API or Kafka connect to get your data into Kafka. Schemas are a great way to make sure that downstream systems receive the data.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In order to produce the plant metadata, I needed to do a lot of research to understand my individual plant's needs. I still sometimes update the metadata based on what I learned about my plants over time. What can I do to make this a little more seamless for me, the user?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Use Telegram to define a conversation workflow that would allow me to input the plant metadata through a conversation on my phone. And Telegram could write that data directly to Kafka for me.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Using stream processing for stream processing with kafka you have options. The easiest and most convenient way to transform your data from Kafka is using KSQlDB. Kafka Streams is a Java and scala library that takes the hassle of managing state off of your hands.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                KSQlDB has two main constructs: a table and a streamed streams. The metadata should probably be represented as a table. The only fields that I hands to specify here explicitly is the key. This is going to help me with processing that I need to do later.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Whenever a house plant has enough low moisture readings telling me that it needs to be watered, I want to receive an alert on my phone. The KSQldb query is designed to aggregate over non overlapping six hour windows. Once we reach 120, we output a result.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                All right, so now you have the tools to get started on your own. I hope that I have planted the seeds in your mind that you're now curious and you would want to try out Kafka maybe for something in your own home. If you have any questions at all, feel free to reach out to me.
              </li>
