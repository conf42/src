    <meta property="og:description" content="Have you ever wondered, "How do I model my schema for my application?" It's one of the most common questions devs have pertaining to MongoDB. And the answer is, it depends. This is because document databases have a rich vocabulary that is capable of expressing data relationships in more nuanced ways than SQL.

<p>Have you ever wondered, &ldquo;How do I model my schema for my application?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s one of the most common questions devs have pertaining to MongoDB. And the answer is, it depends. This is because document databases have a rich vocabulary that is capable of expressing data relationships in more nuanced ways than SQL.</p>
<p>There are many things to consider when picking a schema. is your app read or write heavy? What data is frequently accessed together? What are your performance considerations? How will your data set grow and scale?</p>

              <li>
                Schema design is one of the most critical parts about improving performance and stability of any database. This is especially true, though, for MongoDB. People get wrong the most when setting up a MongoDB database.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Joe Carlson is a developer, advocate and software engineer for MongoDB. This talk is an introductory course to designing a schema. If you want any of the links, video, resources, slides, anything, you can find that at that link below.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The thing I see the most when people are coming from an SQL background to MongoDB is they are designing their MongoDB schemas like they would with their traditional SQL database. There's no rules to it. Instead of asking what data we have, we're asking how do we use this data. We want to minimize costs and optimize for performance.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                MongoDB has a 16 megabyte document limit per MongoDB document. Two ways to model data are through embedding and referencing in MongoDB. Every application is different and uses data differently. When to use each of them is a matter of personal preference.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In MongoDB, we're going to start with the most simple operations and move away up to more complicated, more interesting schemas. The first one we need to be aware of is one to one, right? We're just adding one single new piece of data to our document.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                One to few means that you're not going to have mass amounts of them. prefer embedding if you have only a couple of things you need to be tracking in a dish. Rule two, needing to access an object on its own is a compelling reason to embed it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                For example, let's say you're designing an application for a product that has lots of parts. What I'm doing is doing referencing for each of those parts. Avoid joins and lookups if they can, but joins are not an anti pattern. I prefer embedding, but if I can justify a reason to split it up, go for it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                An array file growing at the unbounded size, even if it's only tracking object ids, could potentially run out your 16 megabyte limit. How do we mitigate that risk? Well, we have a one to squillions relationship you could be developing.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                How you model your data depends entirely on your application's needs. How you're using that data dictates how you're going to be designing the schema. What may work for someone else's project may not work for yours.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The very nature of a MongoDB document allows us to be more creative and do more interesting things with our data set. Note your array should not grow without bound. How you model your data depends entirely on the needs of your unique application.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                With a relational database design, what we're doing is modeling our data independently of our queries. You have to be aware of data growing massively and growing out of the bounds of that document. Every database schema design is different and it depends on the unique needs of your application.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Joe Carlson: If I've inspired you at all in this talk, you should know that we have the MongoDB University. What I'd recommend is just getting out there and doing it right. Just on your next project, spin up a MongoDB database and just use on your backend.
