              <li>
                Stephan Batifau is a developer advocate at Ziliz. Today he will talk to you about vector databases 101. His objective is to explain to you how they work in detail.

              <li>
                Unstructured data is about 80% of the data you have worldwide. vector databases are specifically built to work with this kind of data. They usually like the infrastructure to help you scale and deploy and manage your apps in productions. But you might encounter some problem with the search quality.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The most popular use case is retrieval, augmented generation. It allows you to search over multiple types of data, text and images. Anomaly detection is also a common one. But it's not all about embeddings and everything. When should you use it?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The concept of similarity search works with a vector database. It measures not only the angle but also distance between the two vectors. If you want to reduce your query, you can also filter on those as well.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The flat index is a bit more elementary similarity search. Then you have inverted file flat, which is also called IVF flat. To address memory constraints, we can combine with IVF and product quantization. This addresses the limits of the square concentration.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Milvis combines skip list and navigable small world or otherwise NSW. It can really bring some speeds to your search process. There's no like good or bad index. It really depends on your application requirements.
