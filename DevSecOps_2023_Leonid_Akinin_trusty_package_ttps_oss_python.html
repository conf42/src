Attacks on OSS are not new and they will stay with us, so why not to learn a bit more? In this talk we not only reiterate on what is known, but how it works and how to protect ourselves."/>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                 Tactics, techniques and procedures of attacks on open source software in Python. The code I'm going to show you today can be weaponized for malicious purposes. Use only for educational purposes, and please always do your own research.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In 2023 we have at least four events that were widely discussed in the industry. Python supply chain attacks are targeting Windows developers. For security professional, there's no better way of learning how to defend something than trying to breach those defenses.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are several ways how attackers can compromise your supply chain when it comes to the python and python packages. Four common reasons are initial access, perimeter bypass, data exfiltration, and obviously ransomware. Today we're going to mostly focus on the individual techniques.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We are moving to our first technical demo, which is a starjacking demo. In less than five minutes we basically performed a complete selling of the rating of this project and we reused that rating to make our malicious package look like a legitimate option.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Attackers use encoding encryption, bytecode and embedding binary executables inside of your Python packages. At the end of the talk, we will come to the example of remote access triangle DNX exfiltration, proxying and tunneling of the traffic. You have to consider many, many things to successfully detect them and protect yourselves against them.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We executed six methods from the intentionally malicious package. As you can see on the receiving end, the end that imitates an attacker. The first three are quite commonly known and the exec is very well tracked by many SAS scanners. But why other functions are not detected by why other obfuscation techniques aren't detected.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Most common way is when the payload is invoked at the stage when packages imported. External sandbox or malware is executed either from setup PI or through the init PI. Let's run another demo to see if it happens again.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                All right, so Sam grab was finally executed. Defender did a really good job on detecting it in dynamics. The most fun part, exfiltration and command and control. Infostillers and remote access drones are very prevalent.

                We downloaded malicious package, we installed malicious package and as soon as it was imported, there was some data collected locally and sent outside. It's either sort of like opportunistic type of attack where attacker relies on sort of lack of competence on the receiving end or they just bypass the static analysis.

              <li>
                A small triangle rat was embedded in the malicious package. It spins up a flask instance on the victim's machine and populates this endpoints. All the information requested was sent back to the attacker. Ngrok is actually a legitimate product. But you have to be careful.

                You can use individual development sandboxes. Review project details and reputations so as we demonstrated earlier. Avoid projects that are not published in PYPI. Restrict direct downloads of dependencies. Use proxies. And now we are moving into defenses.
