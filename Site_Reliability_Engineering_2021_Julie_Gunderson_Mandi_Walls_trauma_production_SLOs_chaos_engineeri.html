    <meta property="og:description" content="Customer experience is the responsibility of the entire team. Many organizations leave reliability up to the SRE team, however reliability should be built in from the very beginning.   In this talk Julie and Mandi will discuss what Service Levels Objectives are, why they are important to the organization, and how to define and set them. Going beyond SLOs, attendees will learn what Chaos Engineering is and practical ways to ensure compliance and resilience with best practices. Weâ€™ll show you how to focus your goals and error budgets with examples that will lead to reliability and improved user experience."/>

<p>Customer experience is the responsibility of the entire team. Many organizations leave reliability up to the SRE team, however reliability should be built in from the very beginning. </p>
<p>In this talk Julie and Mandi will discuss what Service Levels Objectives are, why they are important to the organization, and how to define and set them. Going beyond SLOs, attendees will learn what Chaos Engineering is and practical ways to ensure compliance and resilience with best practices. Weâ€™ll show you how to focus your goals and error budgets with examples that will lead to reliability and improved user experience.</p>

              <li>
                You can enable your DevOps for reliability with chaos native. This is reducing trauma in organizations with slos and chaos engineering. Downtime costs money, quantifiable and unquantifiable costs as well.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Julie, why don't you kick us off with some information on slos? Slos and SlIs. The whole point of the whole exercise is about keeping your users happy. When we add chaos engineering into the mix, we can look at this SRE pyramid.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's lots of things that you probably already have in your metrics that sre important but not primary to your user experience. You can use chaos engineering, which is practices injecting failure into your systems to understand and to validate your monitoring.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's some operational maturity that you'll want to have in place before you go down the path to these slis and your slos. You want a lot of telemetry already available. And then observability tools are going to help you underpin all of these components, give you a more complete picture of the ecosystem.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Some people say that you can only do chaos engineering in production. But you can actually adopt the practice in development, right? You're architecting for failure. You just want to work iteratively like you would with code.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Mandi, talk about working with upstream dependencies. Make sure you're prioritizing the user experience first. Work with your error budgets. Focusing on user experience is a real downstream tool of setting goals.
              </li>
