              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Today I'm going to be talking about synthesizing threat informed defense when cloud attack emulation meets detection engineering. I'm the CTO and one of the founders at Mitigant. These I breathe in Berlin. I am super excited to be part of comfort two cloud native 2024.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 cybersecurity is a very noisy domain. To sift the signal from the noise is very important. And I compare it in a way to the needle in the haystack problem. The signals is what you want to be focused on. But the noise will eventually distract you and reduce your proactively.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Trade informed defense is the application of a deep understanding of adversary tradecraft and technology to improve defenses. The idea is to ensure that your security architecture is effective, it actually works and is able to toward attacks. We're going to look deeper into what this means in the next slides.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The second pillar is basically cyber threat intelligence. This is information that has been aggregated, transformed, analyzed, interpreted or enriched. Context is what differentiates you from other organizations. Cyber threat intelligence helps you to fine tune your context more.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Third pillar is testing and evaluation. Mitre engineer recommends use of adversary emulation for testing and evaluating your defenses. This allows you to mimic the behavior of real world threat actors in a safe and in a repeatable manner. None of them is more important than the other.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Five questions to determine whether you need adversary emulation. How do we build a resilient defense that is not static and is easily and easily evaded and indicators of compromise. Adversary emulation helps you to kind of satisfy this requirement.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                These next one is how do we detect, mitigate, respond to, or prevent against threat actor X. It says, are we collecting the right data and run the right queries to detect technique y. For you to reduce problems like false positives or alert fatigue, you have to use the rightData sets.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cybersecurity is moving from actual technology to the people aspect. How do we build experience and skills on our team to defend against real world trades? Even if the technology is the best, if the people are not able to use them properly, it's still going to be challenging.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                GitLab uses adversary emulation without telling the company. There are three main phases of this attack emulation. Step seven is validate detection and response, which is actually a function of detection engineering. Finally, there is a retrospective where they look at the learnings.

                Cloud attack emulation is adversary emulation for the cloud. Best way to tackle these challenges is by narrowing down your focus to cloud. Now we're going to be talking about detection engineering. Detection engineering focuses on developing, fine tuning and maintaining systems.

              <li>
                In this example we're going to be looking at how to validate threat detections in the cloud. And we will go through these three pillars that we discussed in the previous slides. The third pillar is emulating this technique specifically to be sure that your detection is able to capture it.

                A quick demonstration of mitigant cloud attack emulation. Supports up to title attack actions and we also support different attack scenarios. Connects over the AWS API, we don't install agents at all. Cleanup and recovery is going to be automated.
