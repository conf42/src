    <meta property="og:description" content="When it comes to distributed, event-driven messaging systems, we usually see them supporting either one of two types of semantics: streaming, or queueing, and rarely do we find a platform that supports both.    In this presentation, we’ll first get an introduction and some clarifications of event-driven versus message-driven systems, event streams, and stream processing.    We’ll then take a look at Apache Pulsar which offers a very unique capability in modern, cloud-native applications and architecture, in which its platform supports both Pub-Sub and Message Queues, and extends into streams processing as well as performs message mediation & transformation.  We will look at how it relies on Apache Bookkeeper for its durable, scalable, and performant storage of log streams, and leverages on Apache Zookeeper.  We will also see how Pulsar is meant to bring the best of other systems, such as how it fills the gaps that Kafka has and extends its streaming capability in the complex cloud world."/>

<p>When it comes to distributed, event-driven messaging systems, we usually see them supporting either one of two types of semantics: streaming, or queueing, and rarely do we find a platform that supports both.  </p>
<p>In this presentation, we’ll first get an introduction and some clarifications of event-driven versus message-driven systems, event streams, and stream processing.  </p>
<p>We’ll then take a look at Apache Pulsar which offers a very unique capability in modern, cloud-native applications and architecture, in which its platform supports both Pub-Sub and Message Queues, and extends into streams processing as well as performs message mediation &amp; transformation.  We will look at how it relies on Apache Bookkeeper for its durable, scalable, and performant storage of log streams, and leverages on Apache Zookeeper.  We will also see how Pulsar is meant to bring the best of other systems, such as how it fills the gaps that Kafka has and extends its streaming capability in the complex cloud world.</p>

            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Mary Grygleski is a senior developer advocate at Datastax with the streaming team. Her specialty is in Java cloud native data DevOps and now moving into more streaming. Here are several ways of how you can stay in touch with her.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 Apache Pulsar is meant to extend what we have today. It's all about asynchronous processing, concurrency, scalability. It makes the problem even more challenging than before. This is where pulsar can come in and augment the situation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Events is essentially an occurrence that happens in time. Events are more attuned to what human beings are in computing. Real time communication actually isn't all new. But think of the fact that if we do it synchronously.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Event streaming processing involves taking action on a series of data points. CEP is a set of techniques for capturing and analyzing the streams of data as they arrive to identify opportunities or threats in real time. We want events to essentially help with human conditions and make things happen a lot faster.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                And now event driven versus message driven messaging. Think of it more like what we call publish, subscribe or producer consumer type of systems. As systems becoming more sophisticated, then we're seeing more and more event driven systems that comes into play.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Streaming is really referring to the pub sub, the publish subscribe type of a paradigm. Topics essentially just label so that you group all of these messaging together. Those who are interested will have to subscribe to that topic to receive it. Message queueing is a form of asynchronous service to service communication.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Event streaming allows for scalability elasticity to happen a lot more in a more flexible way. It helps to meet the demands of large volumes of data generated by application operating at the edge Iot systems. We use real time data to enhance customer experience and create a competitive advantage for your business.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The real time aspect is what is kind of the core of why we want to do event streaming. We wanted to be able to ingest high frequency of messages, but with very low latency. There's not much of a gap in between when you receive your messages and then process and output it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Apache Pulsar is a unified messaging and streaming platform. It's cluster based, multi tenancy, and the client API surprisingly isn't like way too complicated. It supports Java, C sharp, Python, Go, JavaScript among others. It became a top level project in 2018.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 Apache has a project called bookkeeper. Essentially it does electronic ledger and journals. pulsar leverages on bookkeeper for logging, storing all of these things. It has adopted a tiered architecture design kind of approach. This distributed architecture supports like horizontal scaling really well.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Bookkeeper is a protocol that helps with the writing of all of these log records too. It enables fast write is guaranteed through the journals and then ledgers. It is a library, a project of its own under Apache. I won't go into all the deep details, not just yet.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Apache pulsar represents the next generation of enterprise messaging. It is a unified solution for pubsub up for streaming, for messaging. Also for queueing and also for the messaging, mediation and enrichment. Can run on prem or hybrid georeplication. There's still a lot of things being planned for it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Pulsar provides lower latency and higher throughput. Flexible message processing model. Multi tenancy too. And basically it's good fit for bring use cases as well. Why is it better than kafka?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                At Datastax we offer Astra streaming over here or lunar streams, right. Lunar streaming essentially is all free unless you want to purchase the enterprise support too.
