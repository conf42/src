              <li>
                Gaurav: Thank you for joining me for my talk on scalability on AWS. More specifically scalability and cloud native architecture on Amazon. I'm going to try to keep this talk at more or less a beginner to intermediate level.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The talk is more specific about scalability. Throughout the presentation, I would like to weave business outcomes with security and technology. I will try to make it as business value focused as possible. Here is a cheat sheet to help you understand each and every slide.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Author of the book Security and Microservice Architecture on AWS. Throughout the presentation, I like to keep my examples consistent. That way I don't have to go back and explain what the setting is.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                An ecommerce website needs to be efficient and scalable. An architect can help you figure out how to make trade offs. The whole point of the talk is to look at every application from an architect's perspective.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cloud says you can hand over some of the responsibilities that traditionally were yours to us. But then you lose flexibility that is associated with running your own application. As an architect to evaluate what my business cares about the most, I would like to focus on scalability.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You can achieve scalability in two ways. Vertical scalability is just adding an extra size to a server. The second way is horizontal scalability where you add an extra server to the mix. These are the two factors that will decide whether you want horizontal or vertical scalability.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                If you want to scale vertically, all you can do is increase the RAM or the CPU or the throughput of that application. I wanted to go a little bit into what are the cost implications of that. Ram does become expensive on the cloud and you need to figure out how you can optimize your application.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Most people don't have horizontal scalability by default. Just because you add an extra server to the equation doesn't mean your application can start running faster, better, or process more requests. There are two ways of achieving scalability. The first one is using what is called auto scaling.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 AWS architect: Three scenarios where each one of these modes is the best option to go for. If you have demand that is sustained and fairly stable, it's a flat line you don't need auto scaling. In such a situation, serverless is best option for you. You need to make the right trade off while trying to achieve scalability.
              </li>
