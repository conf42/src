                Emily Arnott: What is reliability? It can be a surprisingly nebulous question. Orgs of all sizes are realizing that reliability should be a focus. She says it should be compared to customer expectations and sociotechnical resilience. How do you measure this new reliability?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                High demand is also a customer oriented factor that puts a lot of strain on these systems. If they can't maintain the standard of communication, there is inconsistent messaging. This creates a sociotechnical resilience crisis. If you think of any sort of service you're unhappy with, you can see how it really is.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Product health, sociotechnical resilience and customer happiness are all important. It's not entirely clear just from this diagram which service you should prioritize. This can be a guiding framework to really uncover and highlight deficiencies.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The new definition of reliability is your system's health. It transforms it into something quantitative from something totally qualitative. It's not always trivial to get these numbers. But it's in the process of gathering this data that you can figure out where your strategic priorities should lie.
