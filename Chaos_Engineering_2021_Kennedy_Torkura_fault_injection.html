    <meta property="og:title" content="Risk-Driven Fault Injection: Security Chaos Engineering for the Fast & Furious | Conf42"/>
    <meta property="og:description" content=""The dynamic nature of cloud-native infrastructure requires continuous security mechanisms to effectively detect security threats, especially those with unknown patterns and behavior. This talk proposes Risk-driven Fault Injection (RDFI) techniques to address these challenges. Essentially, RDFI applies the principles of chaos engineering to cloud security and leverages feedback loops to execute, monitor, analyze and plan security fault injection campaigns, based on a knowledge-base.  The knowledge-base consists of fault models designed from secure baselines, cloud security best practices, and observations derived during iterative fault injection campaigns. These observations are helpful for identifying vulnerabilities while verifying the correctness of security attributes (integrity, confidentiality, and availability). Furthermore, RDFI proactively supports risk analysis and security hardening efforts by sharing security information with security mechanisms.  We have designed and implemented the RDFI strategies including various chaos engineering algorithms as a software tool: CloudStrike.   Several evaluations have been conducted with CloudStrike against infrastructure deployed on two major public cloud infrastructure: Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. The time performance linearly increases, proportional to increasing attack rates. Also, the analysis of vulnerabilities detected via security fault injection has been used to harden the security of cloud resources to demonstrate the effectiveness of the security information provided by CloudStrike. Therefore, we opine that our approaches are suitable for overcoming contemporary cloud security issues. ""/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>&ldquo;The dynamic nature of cloud-native infrastructure requires continuous security mechanisms to effectively detect security threats, especially those with unknown patterns and behavior. This talk proposes Risk-driven Fault Injection (RDFI) techniques to address these
challenges. Essentially, RDFI applies the principles of chaos engineering to cloud security and leverages feedback
loops to execute, monitor, analyze and plan security fault injection campaigns, based on a knowledge-base.</p>
<p>The knowledge-base consists of fault models designed from secure baselines, cloud security best practices, and observations derived during iterative fault injection campaigns. These observations are helpful for
identifying vulnerabilities while verifying the correctness of security attributes (integrity, confidentiality, and
availability). Furthermore, RDFI proactively supports risk analysis and security hardening efforts by sharing
security information with security mechanisms.  We have designed and implemented the RDFI strategies
including various chaos engineering algorithms as a software tool: CloudStrike. </p>
<p>Several evaluations have
been conducted with CloudStrike against infrastructure deployed on two major public cloud infrastructure:
Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. The time performance linearly increases, proportional
to increasing attack rates. Also, the analysis of vulnerabilities detected via security fault injection has been
used to harden the security of cloud resources to demonstrate the effectiveness of the security information
provided by CloudStrike. Therefore, we opine that our approaches are suitable for overcoming contemporary
cloud security issues.

              Summary

              <li>
                Kennedy Torkura is a cloud security engineer at Mattermost and also a PhD student. His PhD is on cloud security. Today he will share knowledge about part of the things that he researched on and some of the theorems he proposed.

              <li>
                Security chaos engineering aims to identify security control failures and defend against malicious conditions. On the other hand, security case engineering addresses availability also, and a slightly different kind of availability. Today we live in a cloud native world, and our systems are getting more and more complex.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cloud native security is about securing cloud native infrastructure. 99% of attacks against cloud infrastructure are going to be caused by users faults. Traditional security mechanisms are struggling to catch up with these recent trends. Security in a cloud native world has to be set up at every layer.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Riskdriven fault injection is about employing security case engineering from a risk perspective. Risk helps us to measure security, that we can communicate this whatever strategy we are trying to propose in more clearer and more sensible ways. The idea here is how we can take security based engineering and push towards it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cloud strike lets you chain various attacks to form an attack scenario. The third stage is about analyzing. Even if you had to stop these experiment, it's critically important to understand why it failed. The knowledge gained from these experiments can be used for training security teams.
