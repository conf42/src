<p>Being wrong is often seen as the WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN&trade;, especially when you’re building business-critical applications and services.
​
But the increased velocity of modern software development, plus the increased need for our systems to be resilient, reliable, and RIGHT has increased the pressure on developers exponentially. Never before have software owners had such an opportunity, or the power, to BE WRONG!</p>

              <li>
                This talk is a slight adjustment on a talk I've been doing for a little while now. It's useful to sort of box chaos engineering and to talk about how we might go beyond it. At the end, I'm going to be saying, okay, everything you're doing is right, but there is a different way of packaging it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                I am quite happy with risk as a motorcyclist. I embrace risk on roads. Fire drills are a terrible analogy for chaos engineering. They make you complacent. When it actually happens, you'll be prepared.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A lady who had absolutely no ability in her brain to become complacent survived 9/11. When I talk about today, I talk, but how chaos engineering should be viewed. Be very sensitive to complacency when you practice something.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Back in Tibet, I saw some wonderful things. It gives me several analogies for software delivery and system delivery. This theory of making something safer means we can often make it a lot more dangerous through complacency. And interestingly enough, there's lots of funny things with safety when it comes to chaos engineering.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Everyone in this industry absolutely loves new terminology for old stuff. New trend at the moment is cloud native. Can we stop inventing terminology? We're terrible at it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                My personal nemesis is we took a beautiful renaissance in data access and persistence technologies, and we did a beautiful number on it. We call it by what it isn't some of the time. So now we're doing something different. We know it's something different, but we don't really know what it is, so we call it services.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Chaos engineering. How many people here have been in conversation and thought, for the 80th time, I'm not engineering chaos because youre not. In some companies, it's called release day. I work with one company, they said, we do continuous delivery. Brilliant.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                If you go in something like cloud native, there's a lot of moving parts. Even when you think you've done everything right, this is production. Don't use the word incident ever. Use surprise.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You do not have an obvious system unless you are writing hello world for a living. If you're building any sort of distributed system, and frankly you are, this is one of the few things I don't need to see. You have to apply such thought processes as systems thinking.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The smallest change can cause the most dramatic and surprising impacts. The only systems I know of that are not, don't follow these sort of properties and are making people money tend to be systems that are no longer changing at all. We're not here to create systems that don't work.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                I teach people how to be wrong for a living. To me, it's a superpower. I am regularly wrong. At university, I was supposed to never be wrong. I still have to now tell people to do TDD.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Being wrong is a state of being mistaken or incorrect. Everyone is wrong all the time. Every system but is wrong. It's a mindset switch to be working in chaos engineering. It starts with recognizing we're always wrong.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Most of us want to move quickly, want feature velocity, and we also want reliability. The faster you move, the more reliable you can be. There is no conflict between these two factors. Go and read a book called accelerate.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's a strong relationship between disasters, incidents, surprises, and chaos for engineering. So all of those disaster recovery plans are not exercised apart from in the moment when you don't want to exercise something new. Believe me. We are doing everything.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Margaret Hamilton was featured in Wired not long ago. There's a great story right in the preface of one of her books. No one reads that. I still get emails from people saying, I can't make rational rows.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The world's first chaos engineer was Lauren Hamilton. She worked on the system software for the Apollo spacecraft. Murphy's law is a law of software development and delivery. Because our systems are vastly more complex than a spacecraft, there is dark debt.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                1 hour of downtime costs about $100,000 for 95% of enterprise systems. In any sufficiently complex or chaotic system, blame is another beautiful one. You can't be covered for this, but you can be better at dealing with it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                David Wheeler: Blame leads us in completely the wrong direction. He says the best reaction is to step back and go, hang on a second. The mindset of chaos engineering is different from that of a motorcyclist. Wheeler: There's many changes we could make to the systems to help avoid human error.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Every system is out to get you. Production hates you. It knows when you're on a date. It's watching you at all times and you're going to be wrong with it. Chaos engineering makes it safer for us to get things wrong with our system. We practice zero blame.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                What is the overall business objective that you care about? Make sure you can measure it. Chaos engineering could be better phrased as deliberately practicing being wrong. You're resilient if when something unexpected happens, you can respond to it, learn from it, and improve the system.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's truckloads of tools out there in chaos engineering. The richness of open youre and free chaos engineering tools is a brilliant thing. Out there in the wild, learning chaos engineering is a fabulous place to get started.
