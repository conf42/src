    <meta property="og:title" content="Truth about running Cloud Security Assessments in 2021 | Conf42"/>
    <meta property="og:description" content="This talk is a Practitioners story on what it is really like to run Cloud Security Assessment compared to what the blogs and Cloud Service Provider documentation will tell you. There are some hard truths here, some Cloud Security Assessors might not like me giving away the reality but it is better out than in.   I share Real world Assessment stories and how it differs from documentation and some automation tools that I personally use for running automated security scans    If you are a seasoned Cloud Security Assessment running person or If you are looking at starting to do Cloud Security Assessment in Cloud, you will get a glimpse of what that world really looks like. You might not like me if you are CSPM but the truth has to come out. "/>

<p>This talk is a Practitioners story on what it is really like to run Cloud Security Assessment compared to what the blogs and Cloud Service Provider documentation will tell you. There are some hard truths here, some Cloud Security Assessors might not like me giving away the reality but it is better out than in. </p>
<p>I share Real world Assessment stories and how it differs from documentation and some automation tools that I personally use for running automated security scans  </p>
<p>If you are a seasoned Cloud Security Assessment running person or If you are looking at starting to do Cloud Security Assessment in Cloud, you will get a glimpse of what that world really looks like. You might not like me if you are CSPM but the truth has to come out. </p>

              <li>
                Today's talk should really have been documentation versus the reality of cloud cloud cloud security assessments in modern day architecture of cloud environment in 2021. But clearly you would not be here if I said that you might think it's just a fun talk.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                This talk will discuss the framework that people use to run assessments. We also talk about the type of threats, the assessment types, automation. And come of the differentiation between running an assessment from an auditor versus having automated tooling. Maybe this may be an introduction to what modern auditing could look like.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                I am the head of security and as a CISO, four of a growing company. Outside my nine to five on the weekends, I am the host of Cloud security podcast. We talk to different cloud security experts on various topics around cloud security each week.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 Azure, GCP and AWS all have documentation on AWS. People go through exercises to shape some of their organization architecture with the well architected framework. But a lot of times what we would find in an audit is not really well aligned, it's not by the textbook.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are two ways to move into cloud. One is a simple lift and shift model. Another is where you migrated into cloud but went through digital transformation. Depending on the cloud adoption type, you could have gone down either way.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                If someone tells you we only have one tenancy, you probably are looking at potentially hundreds of services. Application itself, you could have a mix of monolith or a microservices. Digital transformation may not have fully been adopted.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Not everyone does automation in cloud, not everyone does infrastructure has cloud. The other thing that you would also notice from a source perspective is the type of access you get. If you're one of those, you probably should start thinking about don't just rely on cloud native.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                People have this negative, I guess, emotion attached to doing threats assessments. If you look at all of these drive by compromise, exploit, public facing application phishing, trusted relationship and valid accounts, they kind of fall into three big buckets.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Your identity access management uses the same password as your corporate username password. In a cloud environment, it's not just a regular user, an admin user. If someone exploits that, they can use it for doing exactly the opposite of what it should be doing. Third party management for this is primarily around shared responsibility.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Let's talk about assessment types. One is a point in time, big bracket. Another is more awareness and visibility and monitoring. The continuous assessment type is cloud security posture manager or cloud access security brokers.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Another version that's coming out which is specifically for infrastructure as code, which I believe is almost like the next generation of cloud security. These are lists which are applicable across the board for the moment. So definitely check these out and obviously ask any questions if you have any.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You definitely need both continuous as well as point in time assessments. Running an assessment on premise is not the same as running assessment on cloud. A successful compliance certification doesn't really mean you're secure. Find your trusted advisor to get a real picture of risk in your cloud environment.
