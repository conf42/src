                Artificial intelligence has emerged as a transformative force, advancing innovation and revolutionizing how we live, work, and interact. This talk is about the skills that fuel the delivery of successful AI solutions. Most slides I'll be either summarizing or elaborating on the on screen content.

                Of the 111 skills, one is paramount and one is common amongst successful AI teams. The category is soft skills. What exactly within soft skills do successfulAI teams have in common? Well, it's the team. This talk will dive into team development.

                Scott Rafis: Dr. Bruce Wayne Tuckman published his model of team development in 1965. This talk is based on 117 sources, most of which were published in the last ten years. To introduce and navigate models like those one on team development, interesting visuals and practical examples can be extremely helpful.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Across the five phases of teams development, development forming, storming, norming, performing and adjourning, there's a graph. What it depicts is the general level of performance or productivity. I wanted a visual also to represent a team because this is about people.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                During forming, people are displaying eagerness and socializing. The leader can facilitate those behaviors and provide as much information as possible. Icebreakers aren't just for people who have never worked together before. Quick response times are particularly helpful.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Next up is storming and what happens during storming. Storming can be a business day or less, or it can be the entire length of the project. Here are the strategies to help those team grow in advance. Request and encouraging feedback.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Building trust by honoring commitments. The most powerful thing you can do to build an advanced trust is to honor commitments. That doesn't mean you can't ever change your mind or cancel a meeting. But honoring your commitments goes a real long way to building trust.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Next up is the norming phase. It is the second highest level from a performance or productivity standpoint. Here purpose and goals are more well understood, which can translate to higher levels of confidence and commitment. Here's what you can do to help the team grow in advance.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                From norming to performing rather. This is those highest level of productivity and performance. According to the literature, this is correlated with happiness and success. Celebrating successes has different meanings of different organizations.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When teams disband, there can be sadness. But there's things that you can do about this for everyone's benefit, for the individual, the team and the company's benefit. Here, I'll talk about strategies to help the team grow.
