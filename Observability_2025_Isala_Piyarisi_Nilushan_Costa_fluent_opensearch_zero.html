{"text": "Whenever logs are generated, we pump them into open search as well as log", "timestamp": "00:11:41,119", "timestamp_s": 701.0}, {"text": "analytics, and we use two different APIs to fetch

"timestamp_s": 712.0}, {"text": "And a historical logs API, which fetched data from Log Analytics,", "timestamp": "00:11:56,854", "timestamp_s": 716.0}, {"text": "open search retained data for about an hour, an hour and a half.", "timestamp": "00:12:01,444", "timestamp_s": 721.0}, {"text": "And log analytics retained for a longer period than that.", "timestamp": "00:12:05,914", "timestamp_s": 725.0}, {"text": "So since open search had a lower latency, we were able to show the logs quickly", "timestamp": "00:12:09,814", "timestamp_s": 729.0}, {"text": "by fetching the that data from the live logs API at the same time for users", "timestamp": "00:12:15,664", "timestamp_s": 735.0}, {"text": "who wanted to look at historical data.", "timestamp": "00:12:21,514", "timestamp_s": 741.0},

this initial deployment worked well and we got a good learning", "timestamp": "00:12:37,494", "timestamp_s": 757.0}, {"text": "experience with fluent bit and open search, and we were actually

"timestamp_s": 826.0}, {"text": "And then we use open search dashboards for our internal users.", "timestamp": "00:13:48,079", "timestamp_s": 828.0}, {"text": "So let\u0027s say there is some sort of

"00:14:10,254", "timestamp_s": 850.0}, {"text": "team could log into the open search dashboard and access these logs.", "timestamp": "00:14:15,534", "timestamp_s": 855.0}, {"text": "Finally, we kept

health-based approach.", "timestamp": "00:14:33,104", "timestamp_s": 873.0}, {"text": "What we did was we based our health chart.", "timestamp": "00:14:35,174", "timestamp_s": 875.0}, {"text": "On the upstream helm chart, and we customized it the way that we wanted.", "timestamp": "00:14:38,789", "timestamp_s": 878.0}, {"text": "So with the open search operator base deployment, we had objects like

<p>We rebuilt our platform&rsquo;s observability using Fluent Bit, OpenSearch &amp; Prometheus, improving user experience with &lt;5s log latency and ~70% cost savings. This talk explores our migration, achieving zero-instrumentation telemetry via eBPF and lessons building a faster, cheaper OSS stack.</p>
