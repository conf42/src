              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                The talk will talk about orchestrating data and ML workflows with Apache Airflow. The main part of the talk will be a walkthrough this data driven ML pipeline in airflow. And I will close with a few ML and airflow resources in case you want to get started on your own.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                What is ML orchestration? It's a fairly new term. It is part or a subset of ML ops. You have overlap between machine learning, DevOps, and data engineering. And then over all of that, you have orchestration.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                And this is what we call ML orchestration for this talk. If you are working in the ML sphere, you have your typical data science machine learning process. Along the way here you have a lot of steps that could be automated. This is where airflow comes in. We try to automate everything that is somehow possible to automate.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Apache Airflow is a tool to schedule and monitor your data pipelines or any other of your Python code. It's the most popular open source choice for this use case with 12 million downloads per month. There is a large and vibrant open source software community.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Airflow stands for directed acyclic graph. A dag is comprised of the different tasks. The other great strength of airflow are predefined operators. You can orchestrates data pipelines and ML pipelines in the same place.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Gliomas and meningiomas are two different types of brain tumors. Sometimes the differentiation between the two types is fairly easy. Of course, never conclusively. You would never make a conclusive diagnosis from one picture. But it is something that I could imagine an ML model could be learning.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Using Airflow and the astropython SDK, I created eight separate workflows. Each of those DAX has one task that updates what I call a data set. And then the testing part, the part that tests my fine tuned model runs every time that flag has been raised. This is a super new feature of Airflow 2.6.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The task called create DuckdB. Pool creates an airflow pool, which is an airflow specific feature that is a collection of worker slots. This is used to better handle resources to group tasks that you never want to use too many worker slots at the same time.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The Astro is an open source tool for next generation DAC offering. It tries to create tasks or utility functions that are tool agnostic in itself. With one change of a variable I could change any task that is using the astropython SDK from one to another blob storage.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So I wrapped the whole model fine tuning in a custom operator. That's why it's so great to have things in a modular way. Whenever this task completes successfully, the flag will go up to the airflow environment. I want to be notified if the task was successful. This is fully customizable.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Using Astro convenience tasks or Astro SDK operators. Can turn any SQL query into a task that runs on any table that you put in. Makes airflow much more modular and much more versatile and flexible if you ever change an underlying tool.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Astro CLi is another open source tool that helps you use airflow. Once you have the Astro CLI installed, you can run Astro start next and it will start up an airflow environment with two example dags for you ready to use. Here is how easy it is to create a custom operator.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                This is just a very simple ML and data orchestrating pipeline. There is much more that you can do here. For example, you could use dynamic task mapping to fine tune your models. At scale, I would try to use a relational database with the option of parallel writing.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are a lot of resources that are specific to ML use cases. The main take home message here is airflow is the one central place that can orchestrates both your data and your ML. Pipelines can have complex interdependencies and it is fully tool agnostic.
              </li>
