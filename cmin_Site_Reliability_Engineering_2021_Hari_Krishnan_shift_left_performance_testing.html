              <li>
                Most of the performance issues are identified within the staging environment. The higher environments are highly contested. We'd like to identify most of the issues on our local machine. There are multiple issues, or rather challenges, in applying shiftlift to performance testing.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There is a verifiability and falsifiability aspect to hypotheses. How does that apply to software engineering and particularly to performance testing?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                One more example of this scaling down I'd like to share. I call it a with and without experiment, or the AB experiment. To say the cache makes a difference, in fact, it's working and then I can take it to the higher environment.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The problem with trying to run performance tests within your sprints cycle is time consuming. The better way to look at this problem is to reduce the longest testing itself. How do we do that? We reduce effort, we reduce complexity and reduce repetition.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Perfumes is a tool that we came up with based on some of these principles. It helps processors and developers collaborate, wherein the developer can write API tests in karate. The entire orchestration is handled by coffee and it's dockerized. Here's a quick demo of perfies.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Perfies can enable you to shift left and test very much on your lower environment. The same setup can pretty much be promoted to the higher environment. Gather metrics both from Gatling and your application and visualize that on Grafana.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The biggest challenge of shifting left and performance testing is the mindset itself for performance testing versus performance engineering. It'd be nice if we could use burp testing more like a learning activity through multiple spikes, which helps us avoid guesswork in our system architecture.
              </li>
