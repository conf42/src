    <meta property="og:description" content="I remember saying it over and over again, and always feeling like something is just not right. "I've finished, it's working.. only tests left". Why do I write tests if the task is finished and works as intended? And why is it considered to be a pain to many developers?  In this session I'll be showing the solution to the conflict above, which requires a shift of mindset towards TDD. I'll be live coding the famous Bowling Kata while letting the tests(use cases) drive my design and implementation so that once the code is written and working, the task is actually done."/>

Okay?", "timestamp": "00:04:23,434", "timestamp_s": 263.0}, {"text": "When I think about it today, it\u0027s actually pretty absurd.", "timestamp": "00:04:27,670", "timestamp_s": 267.0}, {"text": "Why? Because it makes me a bit angry.", "timestamp": "00:04:31,054", "timestamp_s": 271.0}, {"text": "Why? Because usually when I write tests, after I write the code,", "timestamp": "00:04:34,110", "timestamp_s": 274.0}, {"text": "two things happen. First, I need to rework my code. Perhaps I", "timestamp": "00:04:37,608", "timestamp_s": 277.0}, {"text": "discovered that the code is not that testable, that I\u0027ve missed some of the things,", "timestamp": "00:04:41,308", "timestamp_s": 281.0}, {"text": "okay? And I need to rework on something that I actually already know that it\u0027s", "timestamp": "00:04:45,100", "timestamp_s": 285.0}, {"text": "working. Second thing that happens when I write the test after the", "timestamp": "00:04:48,802", "timestamp_s": 288.0}, {"text": "code. So the test code actually becomes a second class citizen,", "timestamp": "00:04:52,672", "timestamp_s": 292.0}, {"text": "which means that I treat it not as good as", "timestamp": "00:04:56,758", "timestamp_s": 296.0}, {"text": "I treat the production code, okay? I do not adhere", "timestamp": "00:05:00,352", "timestamp_s": 300.0}, {"text": "to design principle. The code is not very clean and the code", "timestamp": "00:05:04,058", "timestamp_s": 304.0}, {"text": "becomes not maintainable. Now, if the test", "timestamp": "00:05:07,572", "timestamp_s": 307.0}, {"text": "code is hard to maintain and hard to develop on top of,", "timestamp": "00:05:11,076", "timestamp_s": 311.0}, {"text": "so my entire code base actually becomes this way. Okay? So this", "timestamp": "00:05:14,516", "timestamp_s": 314.0}, {"text": "is a very important point. The test code should not be a second cases citizen.", "timestamp": "00:05:18,488", "timestamp_s": 318.0}, {"text": "Another thing that the afterthought effect causes is the following diagram.", "timestamp": "00:05:22,894", "timestamp_s": 322.0}, {"text": "Okay? We are always stressed", "timestamp": "00:05:26,766", "timestamp_s": 326.0}, {"text": "out, right? We always need to deliver more and more value.

We have to deliver something we don\u0027t have time to test.

Now, having no time to", "timestamp": "00:05:51,536", "timestamp_s": 351.0}, {"text": "test has its effects, right? It causes software", "timestamp": "00:05:54,948", "timestamp_s": 354.0}, {"text": "defects. If I do not test my software, I probably am missing something,", "timestamp": "00:05:58,362", "timestamp_s": 358.0}, {"text": "right?

And this is a very vicious", "timestamp": "00:06:05,828", "timestamp_s": 365.0}, {"text": "cycle and I want to avoid it in some way. Now, another thing that it", "timestamp": "00:06:09,758", "timestamp_s": 369.0}, {"text": "causes if my test suite is incomplete because I don\u0027t have time to test", "timestamp": "00:06:12,968", "timestamp_s": 372.0}, {"text": "from time to time, so my trust in the test suite actually decreases.", "timestamp": "00:06:16,396", "timestamp_s": 376.0}, {"text": "Okay? Now let\u0027s talk about the unit effect. Now, the unit effect", "timestamp": "00:06:20,962", "timestamp_s": 380.0}, {"text": "has its own downside. Now, when people are asked,", "timestamp": "00:06:26,010", "timestamp_s": 386.0}, {"text": "what are unit tests?

<p>I remember saying it over and over again, and always feeling like something is just not right.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve finished, it&rsquo;s working.. only tests left&rdquo;. Why do I write tests if the task is finished and works as intended? And why is it considered to be a pain to many developers?</p>
<p>In this session I&rsquo;ll be showing the solution to the conflict above, which requires a shift of mindset towards TDD.
I&rsquo;ll be live coding the famous Bowling Kata while letting the tests(use cases) drive my design and implementation so that once the code is written and working, the task is actually done.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Tal Doron: Today I'll be speaking about the complex relationship between software developers and test code. I'm also going to suggest and mainly demonstrate with live coding. Today we're actually going to focus on testable code, valuable tests and TDD.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                About 55% of developers say that they don't like writing tests. There are two main things that affect this relationship. The afterthought effect and the univ effect. Testing should not be a second cases citizen.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The unit effect has its own downside. Usually people talk about the testing pyramid that you probably know. This testing pyramid is a bit problematic because it says several things. It actually adds like four other angry emojis to the picture.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                If I need to test lots of units of code in isolation, I should spend lots of my time in writing mock objects. Second thing, the quantity of test rises. Refactor the code if needed, before you continue. Here are some of the main reasons developers don't like writing tests.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In order to demonstrate TDD, I want to do a code kata. A kata is a sequence of movement that a martial artist does over and over again. Dave Thomas took this idea to the programming world. The bowling kata tells us how to calculate the result of a bowling game.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Using TDD, we can test for business flows. The first test in TDD needs to describe something very easy, right? I don't want to take the hardest scenario possible because then I will need to implement lots of code in order to adhere to it. Here's how we test.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Test code is as important as production code in TDD, meaning whenever I'm doing refactoring. Instead of using a module here, I will actually use a class. This is the idea of red green refactor.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Webstorm doesn't recognize code application replace them by their own. They have actually promised that they will fix it soon. I want to do some refactoring here in order to meet the new requires, which will be calculating something from the next frame.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When doing TDD tests, please start from green. In this way I will know that my refactoring didn't break anything. Instead of iterating over roles, I want to iterate in the context of frames. Let's see if that's working.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Check if this is spare. Comments are actually not that good practice. We need to comment things only that we are unable to express via readable code. Instead of this comment, I would actually take this entire condition, extract it to its own method. Now it's much more readable.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Refactoring causes me to refactor my code over and over again. I'm always keeping my code tight and clean. Every test that we're going to add here is going to pass. Should I add more tests if I don't need to change any code?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                I think it's very concise. It's very, very expressive. And very readable. So when the number of possibilities is closed, so we're actually good. But I would say that the bowling game has never changed, at least not that I know of.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                I highly recommend on practicing on code cutters such as the one that I've just did. The effect of muscle memory actually works when you go later on to production. Try to go for business flows instead of unit test. Feel free to contact me on any platform.
