              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Jeroen Willemsen is a security architect at Xebia and a Phil Stack developer. We have a running discord server where you can find me to ask me any questions about this presentation or give me feedback. I would really love to hear from you what you've thought of this presentation and how I can improve from this.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The major question that all of us possibly have faced already is can you keep a secret? What we'd like to do is take you on a journey throughout various places where we see secrets being stored or shared and possibly somewhat secured. I hope you'll find this an enjoyable presentation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Hard coded secrets can be easily overloaded into various places in your application code. This goes all the way from Docker secrets, kubernetes secrets and stuff stored in AWS. We put all of these samples in a project called Wrong Secrets. We're looking for new people that can help us out setting up more different type of secrets.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Docklehawk allows you to scan and find the secrets defined in that code. There are a number of challenges, including visibility and authorization. Can you actually tell who has access to these secrets at which moment and from where? How can we prevent and prevent this happening?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So what about Kubernetes configuration maps? By default, config marks are not encrypted and they're just in the storage called ETCD by default. Have your secrets metadata in place so it becomes easier to migrate this towards some other solution.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Kubernetes secret can do secret management where it can manage your static secrets or dynamic secrets. It actually has credentials as a service we can configure backend to connect to it. How about third party providers like Iccorp fault?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The secret management solution is used by the Java spring boot cloud application. It leverages the Kubernetes service token offered to it. With fault, you can also audit the actual configuration because everything is covered. Use PKI there to stop all one shop for all.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You can store secrets in the AWS SSM parameter store or use the AWS secrets management. Both are covered in the wrong secret project with their own challenges. Make sure you have fine grade policies in place and that you don't attach all of those policies to a single role.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We basically use terraform to provision our environment in AWS. While generating it, we actually generated the secret itself, which is actually the correct secret. Luckily, there's alternative providers that have a configuration to encrypt the secret in a proper way. Use those when you really have to provide secrets through infrastructure as code.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's really no single solution that will always work and always cater to your needs. Make sure you can and will rotate your secrets. Label your secrets so migration will not hurt that much. Start revising your security procedures around them.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
