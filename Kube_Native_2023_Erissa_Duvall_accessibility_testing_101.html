                I will mention some regulations in the course of this talk, but I am not a lawyer and thus am not. Any views or opinions that are expressed by me are not representative of my company, necessarily my employers. They are mine.

                 accessibility is how well can someone access your content, services, facilities, regardless of whether or not they have a disability. Building accessibility test plans and tools can help you along the way as you work to make things more accessible.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The categories are divided up based on types, time and visibility. Categories include hearing, vision, mobility, comprehension. Why make things accessible? Well, by creating an experience where people can all access the same information and services.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Most notably is the different worldwide web consortium, or w, three c guidelines made by their web accessibility initiative. Don't be too strict because otherwise you may miss out on opportunities to make things more accessible. The big thing is shift left. The idea of including as early in the designing, all that can benefit you with accessibility.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You want to test across as many environments as possible. Just the way that content can be interpreted by those different screen readers can vary slightly. You want to make sure to hit all the different environments that you can so you catch those little side issues.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                These are tools that for the most part may be already available to you. I'm going to mostly focus on things that are free here because those are usually the easiest ones too. If you're trying to pitch to your employer to get them to let you have access to things, those are going to be the easiest.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A lot of these tools are meant to help make things more accessible to users with disabilities. There's different color filters, there's the built in screen readers. There are also some different desktop applications you can get. What better way to know if your content is going to be accessible to someone with a disability than to use the tools.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Microsoft accessibility Insights is available as a browser extension for Chrome based browsers and also as a desktop application for Windows. There's also an accessibility insights for Android that's both downloadable to Windows OSS. It's also open source. You could actually go in and recommend a fix for it yourself.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Next im showing on the screen here is the wave tool. The wave tool is accessible through a browser extension and through a website interface. Next we have the W three C markup validation service. Finally, we also have accessibility bookmarklets.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Inside the body it's basically all divs. All the text is inside of either paragraph tags or spans. There are no nav elements to help describe what areas are navigation links. Using all this proper semantic HTML, you're essentially doing that same thing for someone using assistive technology.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Lighthouse is the automated testing tool that is available within Chromium based browsers like Google Chrome or the new Microsoft soft edge. It gives you options to highlight, do color contrast checks, tab stops, landmarks. And we also have accessibility insights. Can be helpful for developers who may not have as much accessibility testing experience.

                Andy was developed by the Social Security Administration and is used for section 508 compliance testing. You can find all kinds of these bookmarklets. There are all the different desktop applications, bookmarklets and more that I covered during this presentation today.
