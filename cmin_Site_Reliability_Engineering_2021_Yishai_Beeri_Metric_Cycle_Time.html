    <meta property="og:description" content="If you only measure one metric this is it: Cycle Time.  It is probably the most underrated and least understood metric in engineering.  Yet this is the metric that comprises the most important aspects to measure in your engineering process.  Here’s why.  High performing teams know it’s a marathon and not a sprint, that a steady and swift flow of value wins out in the end, and shipping many small improvements quickly in aggregate translates to great gains for your organization (in the spirit of kaizen).  The way to do this is by ruthlessly removing productivity killers like context switches, work in progress culture, and dead value that isn’t shipped.  By measuring the process, and not the individuals you are putting your emphasis on the team effort, which is great for culture - in contrast to highly toxic individual performance metrics.    This talk will focus on how to fine-tune and get Cycle Time right.  It’s a mix of improving your planning, interfaces between product and engineering, communication, review and quality gates and release mechanisms, essentially everything your engineering process encompasses. If you can game this metric, then you will realize huge gains for your entire dev process and engineering organization. "/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>If you only measure one metric this is it: Cycle Time.  It is probably the most underrated and least understood metric in engineering.  Yet this is the metric that comprises the most important aspects to measure in your engineering process.  Here’s why.</p>
<p>High performing teams know it’s a marathon and not a sprint, that a steady and swift flow of value wins out in the end, and shipping many small improvements quickly in aggregate translates to great gains for your organization (in the spirit of kaizen).  The way to do this is by ruthlessly removing productivity killers like context switches, work in progress culture, and dead value that isn’t shipped.  By measuring the process, and not the individuals you are putting your emphasis on the team effort, which is great for culture - in contrast to highly toxic individual performance metrics.  </p>
<p>This talk will focus on how to fine-tune and get Cycle Time right.  It’s a mix of improving your planning, interfaces between product and engineering, communication, review and quality gates and release mechanisms, essentially everything your engineering process encompasses.
If you can game this metric, then you will realize huge gains for your entire dev process and engineering organization. </p>

                 Linearb is a startup that's all about improving dev teams and improving the dev process. We deliver software delivery intelligence by providing dev teams with the right information at the right time. You can enable your DevOps for reliability with chaos native.

              <li>
                Instead of focusing on individual metrics, you should be measuring the process. Can we find places where the process is not efficient? Can we shine a light on things that kill productivity? Three of the top productivity killers in dev teams.

              <li>
                Coding tends to the time it takes to code something. Having good requirements upfront is a great way to get coding time down. The next segment is pickup, and coordination in the team. All of these measures are going to help push things through faster.

                The review process is perhaps the most complex or elaborate segment here. It's multiple stages where people review the code, have some comments, then the original coder needs CTo get back to this and make some changes. By driving review time down, we can get to these better outcomes.

                Modern teams strive to have streamlined deployment. By having shorter cycles, smaller pieces of work that start and finish more quickly instead of longer, you get better predictability. Some of the benefits that elite teams get when they really reduce cycle time consistently.

                Leonard: Cycle time is a great measure to look at the dev process. It focuses on context switching on work in progress, on dead value in the code base. He shows how dev teams can slash down their cycle time by up to four x in a very short time. Leonard invites everyone listening to this to join our dev underrated community.
