    <meta property="og:title" content="Defeating Ransomware Attacks with Security Chaos Engineering | Conf42"/>
    <meta property="og:description" content="Due to the rapid increase of ransomware attacks in the last year, 2021 was tagged the  "Golden Era of Ransomware".  Most ransomware countermeasures recommend backups and runbooks. However, these techniques are seldom verified to ascertain the level of technical efficiency they provide. Furthermore, the human operators who use these ransomware countermeasures rarely have the opportunity to understand how to react to ransomware scenarios. A more effective way is by leveraging security chaos engineering to overcome the aforementioned shortcomings. By conducting planned experiments, ransomware countermeasures can be crafted as a hypothesis and proven. This approach enables security incident response teams to gain confidence in their technical and organizational skills as well as practice how to operate the ransomware countermeasures."/>

            </h3>
<!-- Text -->
<p>Due to the rapid increase of ransomware attacks in the last year, 2021 was tagged the  &ldquo;Golden Era of Ransomware&rdquo;.  Most ransomware countermeasures recommend backups and runbooks. However, these techniques are seldom verified to ascertain the level of technical efficiency they provide. Furthermore, the human operators who use these ransomware countermeasures rarely have the opportunity to understand how to react to ransomware scenarios. A more effective way is by leveraging security chaos engineering to overcome the aforementioned shortcomings. By conducting planned experiments, ransomware countermeasures can be crafted as a hypothesis and proven. This approach enables security incident response teams to gain confidence in their technical and organizational skills as well as practice how to operate the ransomware countermeasures.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Kennedy Torkura will talk about defeating ransomware attacks with security chaos engineering. Make up real time feedback into the behavior of your distributed systems. Errors in real time allows you to not only experiment with confidence, but respond instantly to get things working again.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Ransomware is a type of malicious software that blocks access to data or computer systems. Usually by encrypting it until the victim pays a ransom fee to the attacker. Victims will pay a total amount of about $265,000,000 because of ransomware by 2031.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Five main impacts of ransomware attacks. Financial loss, reputation damage, legal implications. Often the case where it either directly violates regulations like GDPR. And of course, it disrupts business.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Ransomware is a combination of multiple steps. Before a ransomware becomes successful, it means the attackers have carried out multiple attacks against the infrastructure. And they're also distributed using ransomware as a service, which is another factor that has made ransomware to become very rampant these days.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There is a lot of misconceptions about ransomware in the cloud. Attackers are now beginning to target cloud based systems, cloud infrastructures. One of the major drivers of this change of tactics is the Covid-19 pandemic. The line between on premises and cloud systems is blurred.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The cloud is not immune to ransomware. These cloud offers in the cloud, these is the shared responsibility model. A lot of the security measures that have to be put in place are a responsibility of customers. We will see an attack in the next few slides that shows how s these buckets are being targeted.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The implications of ransomware in the cloud could be worse than the implications in traditional or on premises environments. One of the first layers of ransomware countermeasures is training and awareness. Security chaos engineering is one of the robust ways to prevent yourself from becoming a victim of ransomware attacks.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Security chaos engineering is for the protection of the attributes of security. You want to make sure that the security attributes, which are confidentiality, integrity, and availability are not violated. These scenarios are typically based on Amazon Web services and could be applied to even every other cloud service provider.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Security incident response in cloud environment introduces a lot of challenges. These challenges kind of impact or kind of limit how efficient runbooks can be. Runbooks have to be updated periodically, as often as possible. Also these runbooks must be aligned with the current state of the infrastructure.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cloud environments are not immune to ransomware attacks they can suffer from. You can use security chaos engineering to check whether you are resistant to ransomware attack. I am readily available for you online or on Twitter to answer your questions around this topic.
