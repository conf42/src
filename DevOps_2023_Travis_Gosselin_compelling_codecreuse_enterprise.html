    <meta property="og:description" content="Sharing code and internal libraries across your distributed microservice ecosystem feels like a recipe for disaster! After all, you have always been told and likely witnessed how this type of coupling can add a lot of friction to a world that is built for high velocity. But I'm also willing to bet you have experienced the opposite side effects of dealing with dozens of services that have had the same chunks of code copied and pasted over and over again, and now you need to make a standardized, simple header change to all services across your platform; talk about tedious, frictional, error-prone work that you probably will not do! Using a variety of code-sharing processes and techniques like inner sourcing, module design, automated updates, and service templates, reusing code in your organization can be built as an asset rather than a liability. In this talk, we will explore the architectural myth in microservices that you should NEVER share any code and explore the dos and don'ts of the types of reuse that you want to achieve through appropriate coupling. We will examine effective reuse patterns, including what a Service Template architecture looks like, while also spending time on the lifecycle of shared code and practically rolling it out to your services. We will finish it off with some considerations and struggles you are likely to run into introducing code reuse patterns into the enterprise."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>Sharing code and internal libraries across your distributed microservice ecosystem feels like a recipe for disaster! After all, you have always been told and likely witnessed how this type of coupling can add a lot of friction to a world that is built for high velocity. But I&rsquo;m also willing to bet you have experienced the opposite side effects of dealing with dozens of services that have had the same chunks of code copied and pasted over and over again, and now you need to make a standardized, simple header change to all services across your platform; talk about tedious, frictional, error-prone work that you probably will not do! Using a variety of code-sharing processes and techniques like inner sourcing, module design, automated updates, and service templates, reusing code in your organization can be built as an asset rather than a liability.
In this talk, we will explore the architectural myth in microservices that you should NEVER share any code and explore the dos and don&rsquo;ts of the types of reuse that you want to achieve through appropriate coupling. We will examine effective reuse patterns, including what a Service Template architecture looks like, while also spending time on the lifecycle of shared code and practically rolling it out to your services. We will finish it off with some considerations and struggles you are likely to run into introducing code reuse patterns into the enterprise.</p>

            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                This talk focuses on how do we identify reuse properly. Service templates and service chassis can provide a helpful way to reuse code in an effective way, especially in a distributed microservice world. It can be very difficult to know when to reuse and how to reuse effectively without causing a bottleneck.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Developer experience is the activity of sourcing, improving and optimizing how developers get their work done. At SPS commerce, we think of developer experience in terms of capabilities. These are identified horizontal fast tracks to be curated for maximum productivity within the organization.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Compelling Code Reuse intentionally uses the word compelling. There are appropriate ways and compelling ways to produce and use code reuse. It's always harder to work with microservices as they grow in terms of the volume of them. How should it be distributed?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Do I duplicate the code or do I reuse the code? Understanding that you're going to have to make this decision, especially if you haven't made it yet in your distributed service system. Think about copying code versus reusing code in terms of the law of diminishing returns.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                How do we mature our code reuse practices? We're going to first look at coupling. Coupling is the degree of interdependence between software modules. We'll talk about reuse, talk about duplication, and then have a little bet of a dive into reference and reference code.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When we think about coupling code reuse, let's look at an example. This seemed like a really good identified piece of code we wanted to distribute. But it actually broke down and caused a lot of the pain. We didn't correctly understand the contract or the interfaces that we need.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Emerging need is not enough. High duplication, though, is interesting. You need to have at least three places in the wild that you're not planning for this exist. A great place to identify reusable code is for best practices and principles.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We're looking for that balance of the right level of low coupling, but still having reusable code that provides an opinion in there. Like everything in architecture, that balance is staying in the middle. There are three key areas that we can use appropriate coupling to help us with feature flags.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Another way to think about appropriate coupling and the difference between duplicating and reuse is the traditional animation process. In the same way we think of that with code reuse in a distributed microservice world, there's a ton of cross functional concerns that are just the background. The real business logic is often not something you want to duplicate.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Sometimes understanding if you have an incorrect abstraction is important. Low overhead to savings ratio. Is it already built? And of course you want to think about feasibility here. Sometimes there are just other opinions, there are too many opinions on how to build something.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 shared utility libraries with coupling. Much like many utility libraries, they don't actually belong together. Keep those libraries small, keep them task focused and specific.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A project seed is a very high level reference point for starting a new application. It typically provides standardized folder structure along with SDLC workflow via templates files. We're going to build on that with service templates and then build onthat with service chassis.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A service template is an opinionated reference for specific application and language types. It reduces boilerplate setup and provides consistency on crosscutting concerns. Service chassis changes this around by including configuration for those packages that are being pulled in. You might combine project feels, service templates and service chassis altogether.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Using service meshes and proxies, we can begin to automatically build in mutual TLS tracing, egress, logging metrics, errors, and auth. Now we can make platform level updates, but also roll out distributed piece of code.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are lots of different tools to do that. Tools like dependent bet. If you're using GitHub, dependent bet automatically submits pull requests to your repository with any package updates. It'll change the way you think about distributed code in terms of your velocity as well.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                SPS service template allows you to take advantage of best practices in your organization. Includes a bunch of your own capability, additional security, middleware, swag or sentry. Everything is configurable and ejectable, meaning that you have an escape hatch at every point.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In some cases, achieving a full service template might be a mile high order. Instead of developing grand designs for an internal code framework, it's often best to start small. There is a path forward for effective code reuse for distributed microservices.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Code reuse is the holy grail of software engineering. I'll let you decide on which definition is appropriate. Keep thinking about appropriate coupling for your decisions. Take a look at some of those service templates and chassis that you can build internally.
