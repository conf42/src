              Summary

              <li>
                85% of data projects fail, according to Gartner. Technology is just one small piece of your success with data. Why can't more companies create more value with data?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We need data scientists, data engineers, and operations engineers. Who is the right people at the right ratios? All three of these teams are necessary for success.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Oftentimes a company's data strategy sometimes is just AI. What we have to do is say, what is the business value? Projects that take too long to generate value are going to get canceled. Be careful how you set yourself up for failure.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                It's always important to have clear data on, or clear information or clear numbers on what is the value of what you're doing. Not all gaps are technology. Sometimes gaps are people and technology. These gaps are part of what are going to make you fail in your projects.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Sometimes what I like to do is turn a situation upside down. What happens if all of our plans go wrong? What would have happened? How good is a data engineer at a data science task? Don't overengineer and don't copy.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                My book is called a unified management model for successful. What we need is all three teams working together to create value from data. Only once we have all three of these things that we can truly be successful with our data teams.
