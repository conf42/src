              <li>
                The event loop. Don't worry too much because this is an introductory talk. We're going to talk about Javascript, code, JS and more in general. The title of the talk is the event Loop fairy tale.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Lorenzo Pierre: I'm full stack wizard at Birdie, an incredible company in tech for good. We envision a world in which we can all flourish with confidence as we age. We are doing that by reinventing care through technology. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in hearing more about this.

              <li>
                The knights of the thread were a group of valorous knights coming from all over the kingdoms of javadom, the kingdom of the Menaces and Pythonville. They would fight all these dragons that would try to block the joyful life of some of the programming nations. Eventually, a land was created where there would be no blocking whatsoever.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The inhabitants of the land of promise had a very unique way of handling their tasks. The tasks would be able to do multiple things at the same time. One would think concurrently. You must think of this as a possibility.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Astak is the valiant knight of asynchronous, the defender of the promised lands. He makes sure that each task would belong to each specific queue. This is efficient and non blocking so that the event loop could run infinitely.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The event loop is comprised of many things, but let's talk about the phases that make up the event loop. There are mainly six phases that we can talk about, one being the timers. Then we have the pending callbacks, idle prepare, the youll, the check, and the close callbacks.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Lorenzo Pierre: We should simplify the event loop understanding to just a few phases. He says the loop is mostly like going back and forth between one phase and the other. It takes time to learn more about this and to actually get better knowledge, he says.
