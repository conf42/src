    <meta property="og:description" content="They say if something is too good to be true, it usually is … except now. Using the Serverless Framework (the most popular development tool for building serverless applications according to DataDog’s “state of serverless” report) and some JavaScript, you can rapidly spin up applications faster than ever before and get it deployed into a production ready state at the same time without needing to trudge through the maze of complexity that is AWS. Lets not forget to mention you’ll save money at the same time! "/>

<p>They say if something is too good to be true, it usually is … except now. Using the Serverless Framework (the most popular development tool for building serverless applications according to DataDog’s “state of serverless” report) and some JavaScript, you can rapidly spin up applications faster than ever before and get it deployed into a production ready state at the same time without needing to trudge through the maze of complexity that is AWS. Lets not forget to mention you’ll save money at the same time!</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Gareth McCumskey is a developer advocate and customer success engineer at Serverless Inc. He talks about what serverless development is and how it is changing the world. Thankfully, being in a video format, you can pause, rewind, slow it down, speed it up.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                What serverless is, is about taking that existing application youll have and breaking it up in a way to use the cloud serverless available to you in services such as AWS, Google Cloud, Azure and so on. This is what is often referred to as being cloud native.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are a lot of advantages to building serverless applications. There's no infrastructure management, especially if you're using services like S three lambda API, gateway and so on. Accelerated time to market means your business is putting stuff in front of users faster and earning revenue sooner.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The not so usual things that change the way we as developers build applications for the better. Framework are a very integral part of building a serverless application. But there's also other advantages to serverless.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Developing and test locally is difficult to do in the serverless world. Cloud services are very difficult to run locally. A better development model is to push the changes to the cloud and rather test there. Ultimately, you can easily and quickly deploy into a replica of production.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Building serverless applications helps reduce the amount of code you generate. This has the knock on benefit that just by having less code, you're ultimately going to produce less errors. Single largest causes of failures in platforms is code written by developers.
              </li>
