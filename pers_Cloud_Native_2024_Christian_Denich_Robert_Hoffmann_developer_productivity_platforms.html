    <meta property="og:description" content="Developer platforms are getting a lot of hype right now.

<p>Developer platforms are getting a lot of hype right now. But thatâ€™s just something big companies do, with huge Kubernetes clusters and deploying Backstage. Right? Wrong! Actually, it is all about improving developer productivity for a single developer or a company with 10,000 IT professionals.</p>

              Summary

            <ul>
              
              <li>
                AWS: We urge you to forget about platform engineering and instead think about developer productivity. What we mean by that is to find a more customer centric approach to developer platforms. The downward spiral of platform engineering is running too much things and running the wrong things especially.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Developer experience is a framework for a developer or customer centric approach to improving developer productivity. In Devex, the developer experience is modeled in three core dimensions: what you see on the screen, feedback loops, cognitive load and flow state. To improve developer productivity, focus on doing the right things.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We now have a framework to put ourselves into the shoes of a developer to really ask the right questions. And this can be done as a developer experience survey. But any survey can also be used to be an interview. Here are some examples.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Workflows and KPIs are objective measures on how developers are doing. Workflows are a way to ground the perceptions that you got from developers in the first place. KPIs try to capture the envelope of all of this. There are multiple phases you are walking through to come to a minimum lovable product.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                75% of the global annual estimated gen AI impact stems from just four functions. There is no single dimension capturing productivity. You will have to combine quantitative data from your telemetry with qualitative data like surveys. Developer experience may just be the best proxy metric to improve developer productivity.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The typical developer only spends 4 hours and 21 minutes coding, and that's per week. Development is much more than coding. You need a development companion who is supporting you across the software development development lifecycle.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The next steps in development process would be to develop into review. A development companion could help you troubleshoot stuff to go faster back to developing instead of fixing bugs. Shorter feedback loops reduced cognitive load and improved the flow time.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The last part of the software development lifecycle is maintaining apps. To sum everything up, developer experience is likely the best proxy for developer productivity. Spend less time building the perfect abstraction and instead have a development companies explaining it to you.
              </li>
