    <meta property="og:description" content="Writing code is something that we learned. Managing a project E2E - Probably not that much.  In this talk, I’ll share my journey of migrating the entire R&D’s codebase from BitBucket to Gitlab on my own - But with the great help of people along the way - Planning, implementation, and handoffs.  I’ll share best practices for managing a technical project with a lot of takeaways you could adopt so your project will be handled smoothly and successfully."/>

              <li>
                In this talk I'll show my journey of migrating an entire R D code base from BitBucket Cloud to self hosted GitLab on my own. I'll share best practices for managing a technical project with a lot of takeaways that you could adopt.

                Hila Fish is a senior DevOps engineer and has 15 years of experience in the tech industry. She also help organize conferences in Israel, DevOps days Tel Aviv, and Statscraft monitoring conference. And she's a lead singer in a cover band.

              <li>
                This project took in total from planning to implementation and handoffs and the whole works. It took one month and a half to complete. I'm going to drill down to every aspect in this structure during this presentation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A company is migrating from on premise to cloud. To achieve this, they need to plan ahead and set up milestones and due dates. Here's how the project was planned.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The next milestone was a second repo migration and pipeline. Everything that was really progressing towards the actual usage of GitLab was done in this phase. And the last milestone is that migration is fully done.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The most important thing in communication is hearing what isn't said. Information, when delivered properly without overbearing the recipient with details, can help ease the decision managing process. Running the project takes patience, and patience when planning things go wrong.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                GitLab was totally new to me. I didn't know GitLab at all before that project. I really had to rely on documentation a lot since my tight schedule didn't really allowed me enough time to play with the system. GitHub changed their official documentation due to an issue we raised during the implementation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                GitLab was a new tool for the R D department. They didn't know GitLab at all. I wanted to give them the sense of support and know that anything that they need, we are here for them. I also created a dedicated slack channel for them to ask questions and raise bugs.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Planning is a must, especially for long term project. Collaboration matters. Documentation really is key. Change is hard when people are used to working in a certain way. You need to take that into consideration when you plan your project.
