                Paige Cruz: There's no place like production. She tells the story of how a senior site reliability engineer made a change to a cannabis platform. Cruz wanted to create beautiful, indexed logs that would let her filter by request. She started with extensive local testing before making the change.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                SRE Regina George says she didn't blame herself for an incident. She says the incident was an opportunity to learn more about how system works. She credits learning from incidents community and seasoned SREs who've seen it all.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The incident retro document details each step of translating from helm template to Kubernetes. The most popular part of the presentations, by and far, was the life of a request diagram. A metaphor that answered the immediate question of what happened allowed attendees to focus on the deeper details.
