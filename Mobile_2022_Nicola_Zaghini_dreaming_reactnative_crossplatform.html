    <meta property="og:description" content="It was late 2017 when I, the Mobile Architect, was asked to evaluate React Native for the first time: a prospect client explicitly asked for it as a cross platform solution. As a Mobile Architect that built his fortune with native I clearly advised against, pitching native as the only viable option. Few months later AirBnB was sunsetting React Native. What a win, I was right! Sadly the prospect client left as the cost of two distinct developments was unsustainable. I started to doubt my decision. I was almost ready to wake up.  Later in the year I was challenged by the C-levels on how to contain the bleeding costs of double development of every aspect of our mobile products, how to solve feature disparity among platforms, how to get faster to market and so on. We can push our architecture / process as we want but there is a limit that just a technology change can break.  I put myself outside of my comfort zone by giving up on my native dogma, prepared to give cross platform, in the specific React Native, a real chance. I was out of my bed, awake.  With a great team, in a relatively short time frame, we managed to pitch, hire, develop and distribute top class native experiences for thousands of customers and tick all the C-levels requirement boxes. There is no money that would convince me back to how I used to do mobile before.  In this talk I am sharing my experience on how to successfully do cross platform, from pitching to C-levels to forming the right team for executing and delivering top class native mobile apps that delight your customers!"/>

            </h3>
<!-- Text -->
<p>It was late 2017 when I, the Mobile Architect, was asked to evaluate React Native for the first time: a prospect client explicitly asked for it as a cross platform solution. As a Mobile Architect that built his fortune with native I clearly advised against, pitching native as the only viable option. Few months later AirBnB was sunsetting React Native. What a win, I was right! Sadly the prospect client left as the cost of two distinct developments was unsustainable. I started to doubt my decision. I was almost ready to wake up.</p>
<p>Later in the year I was challenged by the C-levels on how to contain the bleeding costs of double development of every aspect of our mobile products, how to solve feature disparity among platforms, how to get faster to market and so on. We can push our architecture / process as we want but there is a limit that just a technology change can break.</p>
<p>I put myself outside of my comfort zone by giving up on my native dogma, prepared to give cross platform, in the specific React Native, a real chance. I was out of my bed, awake.</p>
<p>With a great team, in a relatively short time frame, we managed to pitch, hire, develop and distribute top class native experiences for thousands of customers and tick all the C-levels requirement boxes. There is no money that would convince me back to how I used to do mobile before.</p>
<p>In this talk I am sharing my experience on how to successfully do cross platform, from pitching to C-levels to forming the right team for executing and delivering top class native mobile apps that delight your customers!</p>

            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Nicola Zaghini is a professional mobile engineer with probably 13 years experience. Only recently I moved into cross platforms development and this know four years ago. What he wants to achieve with this talk is to stimulate your curiosity and break a little bit of skepticism on cross platform development.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A cross platform technology may save a problem which is of scalability. How can you fix and deploy thousands of apps in there with the technology that we know the native domain providers. The real killer feature was not code reuse, but it was another thing.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 react native allows developers to cross platforms. Customers touch and feel the native graphic user interface component you're used to. In react native, it could be native code, or could be not native. How is that even possible?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When I say quality, I'm not talking about proof of concept. We have more than 4000 live in the store at the moment. They all change based on the branding. It's truly, truly important even that I communicate to you, my audience, developers, what is the developer experience for cross platform.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Typescript is a very beautiful language. Work with the IDE is another very important topic. Fast refresh adds dramatically to the developer experience. Another really important thing when you evaluate developer experience is the community.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cross platform implies 50% cost reduction, 50% time to market reduction, full resource utilization and uniformity. It also implies faster lead time, rocket time, faster release frequency. Over the air updates are really a key differentiator here.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You have really two options here. You either extend what you have in a sort of a hybrid approach, sometimes called brown bag approach in react Native. My personal advice is don't plan this to be your future for too long. The other option is to rewrite why you do this.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You need to have employee happy for what they do. Be prepared for leavers, but also be prepared for new lovers. Before joining Forrest, I ran an r and D in my previous company to spike react native. They figured out what they had and moved to a company that was doing react native already.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Experienced mobile native developer in the team. Strong native background experience iOS and Android. Engineers that buy in and want to learn. Perfect mixture to make a team able to be successful in reality.

              </li>
              
              <li>
