    <meta property="og:description" content="Public, Private, Hybrid...Multi-Cloud?  As the cloud development options and architectures continue to evolve, we've finally found ourselves at the next new thing: Multi-Cloud. What is it? Do we really need it? How would you take advantage of a multi-cloud solution?  In this talk, I'd like to describe a few real-world use cases where a multi-cloud solution is currently in production, specifically when it comes to data.   Specifically, we'll see how multi-cloud helps: - Data Sovereignty scenarios - Fulfill varied client cloud requirements - Developers have more freedom in choosing services - Achieve greater availability  A demo on how to setup a multi-cloud cluster will also be shown.  The audience will leave with a more confident understanding of real-world, multi-cloud use cases and see how to create their own!"/>

<p>Public, Private, Hybrid&hellip;Multi-Cloud?</p>
<p>As the cloud development options and architectures continue to evolve, we&rsquo;ve finally found ourselves at the next new thing: Multi-Cloud. What is it? Do we really need it? How would you take advantage of a multi-cloud solution?</p>
<p>In this talk, I&rsquo;d like to describe a few real-world use cases where a multi-cloud solution is currently in production, specifically when it comes to data. </p>
<p>Specifically, we&rsquo;ll see how multi-cloud helps:
- Data Sovereignty scenarios
- Fulfill varied client cloud requirements
- Developers have more freedom in choosing services
- Achieve greater availability</p>
<p>A demo on how to setup a multi-cloud cluster will also be shown.</p>
<p>The audience will leave with a more confident understanding of real-world, multi-cloud use cases and see how to create their own!</p>

                Adrian Teka is a senior developer advocate for MongoDB. He will talk about the different ways that you can use multicloud clusters in real world scenarios. Finally we'll see how to actually set up our own cluster and see how easy it is to do in MongoDB Atlas.

                Multicloud is any single architectures that uses two or more cloud providers. This can also mean that it's a mixture of public and private clouds. We're going to be focusing on the big three. So that's AWS, GCP and Azure.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When was the last time that you had to deal with an outage of some sort of managed service? If we go back two years, we'll kind of see a timeline of how many of these outages have occurred and how much impact they had. What is important to know is that no cloud is spared from the pain.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Next is Mohan Pucha, who's the vice president of architecture and digital strategy at Aon. He says we have to be native AWS because of their advanced capabilities in analytics. Now in the real world, we will be seeing how some different multicloud solutions are used.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Canada has this direction for electronic data residency. All sensitive electronic data that's under government control needed to be located within the geographic boundaries of Canada. A couple provinces have actually gone a little bit further than that.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                An emergency services application used multicloud to give them higher availability while still complying with this directive. Another very similar one is Australia passed some similar legislation. In both cases, companies were able to spread availability across multiple regions.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A client wanted to add a recommendation feature to their internal help desk software. One of the common ways to solve this problem is to write custom code. But that's not necessarily the best case because that's a lot of maintenance to put into something that is super custom and it's another thing to maintain. Multi-cloud clusters are the best solution.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Next is another very, I will say, experimental, and this is still being worked. If they're able to work out the kinks would make multicloud a really, really awesome options. But there are still very slight differences between the cloud providers.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A major auto manufacturing company had most of their applications primarily on AWS. They were able to negotiate better pricing deals at Azure. Being able to migrate over that quickly and that seamlessly was something that was very appealing. Depending on the size of data, multicloud clusters could be a nice thing to supplement that kind of architectures.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                As we evolve and start to use more of these cloud services, we find that sometimes we want to use some of the other tools that may be on other cloud providers. The next thing that us as devs will have to worry about now is making sure that we're as cloud agnostic as possible.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Another common use case is that we have european companies who acquire other companies. They want a graceful rollover and they want to make sure that it all properly cuts over. Multi cloud cluster made sense because they already had MongoDB Atlas foundation. This allowed them to do this cross cloud migration much more gracefully.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The data has been the bottleneck for many of these scenarios. By using something like a multicloud cluster, they're able to move closer to that. And so now I'm going to quickly roll over and show you how easy it is to set up a cluster.

              </li>
