            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Today I'm going to talk about practical strategies for navigating complexity in distributed systems. What is a distributed system? What are the main complexities of building such systems? Core principles of system engineering and cybernetics, and the three practices for reducing complexity overhead.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The main disadvantage of monolithic architecture is inability to scale modulus independently. If we'll move further, we can take a look at the opposite one. This is a microservice architecture, where the system is a collection of loosely complete services. What do distributed systems give us?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In order to evolve, a distributed system should be reliable, scalable and maintainable. There are many reasons why networks are not reliable. Good and stable abstractions really help to reduce complexity overhead. This topic is also very broad and we'll take a look on several very useful aspects.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Concurrency is one of the most intricate challenges in distributed systems. If there is no defensive mechanism applied, race conditions very likely will happen. To avoid this problem, there are several techniques can be used.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The dual write problem is a challenge that arises in distributed systems. Since these two operations are not atomic, there is a chance of failure during the publishing of new messages. One possible solution is to implement transactional outbox. Another is to utilize database, transactional lock and custom connectors.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Unreliable clocks is one of the most tricky problems in distributed systems. Time accuracy heavily depends on computer performance. In highly available systems, a new leader has to be assigned. To solve this problem, we need to use some kind of distributed consensus algorithm.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When leader has crashed, there is need to select or elect a new leader. distributed consensus is an algorithm for getting notes agree on something. Without it, it's impossible to solve the problem of highly available software. There are many conditions and trade offs that must be taken into account.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Distributed tracing is an approach for tracking this distributed operation across multiple microservices nodes components. Key idea is to attach a unique destroyed operation id to the initial request, then span it down the road and finally collect and aggregate this unique id to build analytical visualization of the whole.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Another approach that may help to improve the systems observability is orchestration techniques rather than choreography. Cybernetics and software engineering emphasizes creating systems that can adjust to changes, learn from many interactions, and improve over time.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Domain driven design focuses on building a domain model with a deep comprehensive understanding of domain processes and rules. System organized or in hierarchies or subsystem and software system often have a hierarchical structure. This hierarchical decomposition helps really to manage complexity by breaking down the system into more manageable parts.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Talking about Sre SRe is a site reliability engineering. The core principles of SRE is about first of all, embrace risk. Another thing is about automate manual work. And the last thing is to simplify as much as you could do.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Finally, I'd like to talk about simplicity and measuring complexity. A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. Another thing which is quite important to track is about time to train.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So in conclusion, I just want to say that I covered several techniques related to destroyed systems. We want to achieve highly available and scalable software, but it brings a lot of complexities. We need to understand the drawbacks and how to apply best practices to solve this problem.
              </li>
