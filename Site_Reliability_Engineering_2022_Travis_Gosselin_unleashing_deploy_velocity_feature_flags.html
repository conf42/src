    <meta property="og:description" content="A lot of development teams have built out fully automated CI/CD pipelines to deliver code to production fast! Then you quickly discover that the new bottleneck in delivering features is their existence in long-lived feature branches and no true CI is actually happening. This problem compounds as you start spinning up microservices and building features across your multi-repo architecture and coordinating some ultra-fancy release schedule so it all deploys together. Feature flags provide you the mechanism to reclaim control of the release of your features and get back to short-lived branches with true CI. However, what your not told about feature flags in those simple "if/else" getting started demos is that there is an upfront cost to your development time, additional complexities and some pitfalls to be careful of as you begin expanding feature flag usage to the organization. If you know how to navigate these complexities you will start to unleash true velocity across your teams.  In this talk, we'll get started with some of the feature flagging basics before quickly moving into some practical feature flagging examples that demonstrate its usage beyond the basic scenarios as we talk about UI, API, operations, migrations, and experimentation. We will explore some of the hard questions around "architecting feature flags" for your organization."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>A lot of development teams have built out fully automated CI/CD pipelines to deliver code to production fast! Then you quickly discover that the new bottleneck in delivering features is their existence in long-lived feature branches and no true CI is actually happening. This problem compounds as you start spinning up microservices and building features across your multi-repo architecture and coordinating some ultra-fancy release schedule so it all deploys together. Feature flags provide you the mechanism to reclaim control of the release of your features and get back to short-lived branches with true CI. However, what your not told about feature flags in those simple &ldquo;if/else&rdquo; getting started demos is that there is an upfront cost to your development time, additional complexities and some pitfalls to be careful of as you begin expanding feature flag usage to the organization. If you know how to navigate these complexities you will start to unleash true velocity across your teams.</p>
<p>In this talk, we&rsquo;ll get started with some of the feature flagging basics before quickly moving into some practical feature flagging examples that demonstrate its usage beyond the basic scenarios as we talk about UI, API, operations, migrations, and experimentation. We will explore some of the hard questions around &ldquo;architecting feature flags&rdquo; for your organization.</p>

              <li>
                Today we're talking about feature flags. Feature flags enable faster deployments to production. You might call them toggle switches or flippers. We'll explore them in a couple different ways today.

              <li>
                Travis Goslin is a principal software engineer for SPS Commerce. SPS commerce is the world's largest retail network with over 4200 retailers. The company has been on this DevOps and agile paths over the last decade and beyond. Goslin shares some of the takeaways he's had from his journey.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                SPS commerce follows more pure CI practices around continuous integration. When we're ready to go to production and replace our existing release one 10 there we get blocked in a lot of cases. This is a big problem in many of our teams.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A feature flag allows teams to modify system behavior without changing code. Martin Fowler also defines four types of feature flags to be aware of. Features give us a ton of flexibility. At SPS commerce, we had five environments at one point in time. Now we have that down to two.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 progressive delivery is defined by launchdarkly as a modern software development lifecycle. It builds upon the core tenets of continuous integration and continuous delivery. Feature flags can help us achieve some of these key metrics.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A feature flag is just setting up a new user, maybe in an identity system or platform of your choice. Our feature flag then is going to check if Sendgrid email is enabled. With feature flags, it's not just simply a new piece of behavior being added. It's actually an augmentation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A lot of engineering goes into building a fully aware user contextual feature management provider. From a cost perspective, there might be other good options that you want to consider. Should you purchase one, should you build one?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You can use feature flags in many different ways inside APIs. On the UI you have to evaluate and change the flags very dynamically. Having a live websocket or long polling connection that can update that in real time could be very essential.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                How you want to target it is critical. You got to think about from a delegation of that flag will downstream delegation of it want to use first name and last name or email in order to target users. You can also sunset features with it in an interesting way.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The value that that provides in terms of velocity, true CI decoupling, testing and production is just very high. It's not free, right? There's a price to pay for some of these things. But I do believe that it is absolutely worth it for the value you're going to get.
