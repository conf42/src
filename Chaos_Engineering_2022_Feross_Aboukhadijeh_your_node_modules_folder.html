              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Faross: In October, a hacker offered to sell the password to an NPM account that controlled a package with over 7 million weekly downloads. Malware was added to these packages that would execute immediately whenever anyone installed one of the compromised versions. Faross: This is just the tip of the iceberg as attackers take advantage of the open source ecosystem.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Vulnerabilities are accidentally introduced by maintainers, by the good guys. Malware is intentionally introduced into a package by an attacker. It will always end badly if you ship malware to production. We need a new approach to detect and to block malicious dependencies.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We downloaded every package on NPM and we spent a few weeks poking around. The most common attack vector is typo squatting. Dependency confusion happens when a company publishes packages to an internal NPM registry. Third vector that we see a lot is hijacked packages.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Most malware is in install scripts. Most malicious packages actually start their routines upon installation. The next is privileged API usage. And finally, we have obfuscated code.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                If you ship code to production, you are ultimately responsible for it. Most people don't think of their open source this way. We built a tool at socket to help with this problem so you can quickly at a glance get an idea of the security of a package.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's a question about how quickly you should update your dependencies. If you update too slowly, you're exposed to known vulnerabilities. Another idea is to audit every dependency. Is there a way to use automation to kind of do something in the middle?
              </li>
              
            </ul>
