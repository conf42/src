    <meta property="og:description" content="What do you do with all of the data coming out of your systems? Are you spending time diagnosing issues in your distributed systems without a good understanding of how your microservices are built? As system complexity increases, the ability to understand the sum of the outputs becomes more and more difficult and the volume of data about your services becomes overwhelming. Luckily, having an observability mindset when instrumenting your outputs and leveraging the right tool for your team can help you cut through the noise and identify key offenders in your system and resolve them quickly and efficiently. In this talk, we will discuss the differences between traditional performance monitoring and observability and how to understand how they can independently and together ensure the health of your team and keep your end users (and your developers!) happy and focused on the right things."/>

<p>What do you do with all of the data coming out of your systems? Are you spending time diagnosing issues in your distributed systems without a good understanding of how your microservices are built? As system complexity increases, the ability to understand the sum of the outputs becomes more and more difficult and the volume of data about your services becomes overwhelming. Luckily, having an observability mindset when instrumenting your outputs and leveraging the right tool for your team can help you cut through the noise and identify key offenders in your system and resolve them quickly and efficiently. In this talk, we will discuss the differences between traditional performance monitoring and observability and how to understand how they can independently and together ensure the health of your team and keep your end users (and your developers!) happy and focused on the right things.</p>

              Summary

            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Today we're talking about observability versus performance monitoring. The difference between these two ideas and why you should care about them. Going to look a little bit into the history of monitoring. How you can benefit from observability.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 observability is a measure of how well the internal states of the system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs. Just because you have purchased an observability platform or tool doesn't mean that your system is observable. You really want to be sure that you're picking the tools that are right for your environment.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Distributed traces are the shiny new things that we've gotten with application observability. logs are another really important part of observability, and they're more powerful when you can correlate them to other signals. The value lies in the ability to answer questions instead of outputs.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Open telemetry is an open source project. It's the second most active CNCF project after Kubernetes. All of the big players have kind of bought in and started to provide support for it. It gives you a really vendor agnostic approach to generating and sending your telemetry data.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The bigger the restaurant, the more complex it is and the more things that can go wrong along the way. In a restaurant scenario, you may need a lot more monitoring to be able to really understand what's happening. And that can be applied to your system.
