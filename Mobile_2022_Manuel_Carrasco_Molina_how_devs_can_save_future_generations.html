    <meta property="og:description" content="Manuel's passion for software development is way older than his passion for the environment. Still, over the last 10 years, he realized one cannot be more important than the other one.  If I want to leave a livable planet to my grand-children, if I want to have grand-children at all, I need to bring the argument of CO2 on the table regularly at technical meetings and conferences.  I don't want to hide under APIs ever again. I don't want the politician and activist in me to ever hide behind the programmer, because I felt I could convey the message better with slides full of code.  The time is now where I would like to try a wake up call to all of us and explain why if we don't work all together, at every level, the world as we know it, the so-called civilization will be over in 10 to 15 years.  We're the new dinosaurs, let's try to survive instead of writing the next feature in the next sprint. This sprint — the one for our future — is a way bigger story."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>Manuel&rsquo;s passion for software development is way older than his passion for the environment. Still, over the last 10 years, he realized one cannot be more important than the other one.</p>
<p>If I want to leave a livable planet to my grand-children, if I want to have grand-children at all, I need to bring the argument of CO2 on the table regularly at technical meetings and conferences.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to hide under APIs ever again. I don&rsquo;t want the politician and activist in me to ever hide behind the programmer, because I felt I could convey the message better with slides full of code.</p>
<p>The time is now where I would like to try a wake up call to all of us and explain why if we don&rsquo;t work all together, at every level, the world as we know it, the so-called civilization will be over in 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the new dinosaurs, let&rsquo;s try to survive instead of writing the next feature in the next sprint. This sprint — the one for our future — is a way bigger story.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Manuel Carrasco Molina is a developer and a political activist. Has been active with the Green party and in the city council. Has written a book about building privacy into iOS and OS apps. Hopes to spread the good message about our privacy.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The video goes for another, like, in total for 14 minutes. They were fighting against the next problem, which is gas. Hamburg is the biggest polluter in Germany. The forest has been decimated for the last 40 years. Hopefully, luckily, all the activism together and a little bit of political work could stop this madness.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In 25 years, the world would be mostly vegan. Animal agriculture contributes 51% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. One third of all freshwater globally is used by the meat and dairy industry. If you think politics will solve the problem, it can.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Stop using Google, use Ecosia. org, a german company which is being founded by this guy Christian Krell. Once they get the revenues, like the pure revenues, they use it to plant trees with partners. Tune your code. This is very specific in this case to basically Xcode and iOS.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You should be 200% renewable and they should say, hey, we're carbon negative. Another thing, go vegan again. Offer breakfast at your company would be also a way to go kind of packaging free. The downside is that each one is taking their own decision, for example in electricity wise.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Try to reduce or quit flying. Make an app that does good for the world, not just the next useless app. Turn off your tv, use a power switch. Stop automatic updates. Keep it small and so you generate less co2.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
