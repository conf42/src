<p>DORA metrics have become the standard for gauging the efficacy of your software development teams, and can provide crucial insights into areas for growth. These metrics are essential for organizations looking to modernize, as well as those looking to gain an edge against competitors. In this talk, weâ€™ll dive into each one, and discuss what these metrics can reveal about your development teams (and my engineering skills).</p>

              Summary

            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Christina is a founding engineer at Cortex, a series startup backed by Sequoia. She talks about four key metrics to measure your team's performance. We're giving organizations visibility into the status and quality of their microservices.

              <li>
                Dorometrics are used by DevOps teams to measure their performance. The four key metrics are lead time for changes deployment frequency, meantime to recovery and change failure rate. Circle CI is partnering with DevOps research and assessment to put out the next report.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Lead time for changes is the amount of time between a commit and production. Elite performers can have less than an hour in lead time, low performers have six plus months. How do you actually measure and improve lead time for change?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 deployment frequency is how often you ship changes and how consistent your software delivery is. A high deployment frequency will end up reducing your overall risk, even though you are deploying more often. You really want to drive a DevOps ethos across your whole team.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                This is the average amount of time it takes your team to restore service when there's a service disruption. It offers a look into the stability of your software and the agility of your team in the face of a challenge. And it's something that you need to be thinking about as your team thinks about the meantime to resolve.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Change failure rate can include bugs that affect customers or releases that result in downtime. This can also be a good indicator for how much time your team is spending fixing processes rather than working on new features. Key is to empower your developers and give them the tools that they need to succeed.
              </li>
