              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                In today's session, we will be looking at the best practices of building machine learning environments on AWS for regulatory customers. These customers can be in banking, insurance, life sciences, healthcare, energy, etc. But we should be very careful in terms of how these models are being deployed.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Machine learning went from being this aspirational technology to a mainstream technology extremely fast. It's moving from being on the periphery of the technology ecosystem to now being a core part of every business and industry. More than 100,000 customers use AWS for running machine learning workloads.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Customers asked for a solution which can enable the business data scientist to deliver a secure machine learning based solution. The target architecture would be where you would want to leverage the multi account structure of AWS workspaces. The third point would be centralized governance.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                As an application team member, what I need is speed. On the other side of the spectrum, we have the security team or the central engineering team which wants to ensure that there is compliance. That's where AWS service catalog helps you. It helps the application teams accomplish their goal of speed, agility, self service model.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A product can be a cloud formation template. Once it goes into the AWS services catalog, it would then go on into the portfolio. There are different kinds of constraints associated with it. Once the product list is available, the users can see the products and they will be able to launch the product.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                If you want to set up a pipi mirror, you can make use of AWS code artifact which is sitting in a shared services account. A domain is a code artifact specific construct that allows grouping and managing multiple code artifact repositories together. You can also have this integrated into your CI CD pipelines.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                How you will be building these infrastructure components by using AWS cloud formation. It's going to be a private VPC. You need the VPC endpoints for any communication with other AWS services. Third part is the flow logs. This allows you to look at the traffic flowing in and out of certain enis.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Service control policies are applied at the OU level, which is the organization unit. They help you provide these broad strokes on certain restrictions which you would want to apply across the organization. In next slide, we will be looking at what kind of service control policies can be applied for data.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Certain AWS AI services may also store and use the customer content for processing these services. As an AWS customer, you can just opt out from using the data to improve the Amazon AI services. You can make use of AWS config in order to enforce the detective controls.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The next slide is about the centralized governance of the PIP dependencies. By using the service catalog tools you can create these end to end pipelines. These pipelines will be responsible for getting your cloud formation template and converting it into a product which can be shared with multiple accounts.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We are trying to enforce certain guardrails, especially when it comes to building a secure machine learning environment for regulated customers. In that case, you want to run everything within a private VPC. All these things are encrypted as per the standards that you would be having within that organization.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Finally, it comes to monitoring, monitoring the deployed models. And this is where we are using cloud watch. You can also look at the model latency and the overhead latency. The best practice would be to monitoring these cloud trail events.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
