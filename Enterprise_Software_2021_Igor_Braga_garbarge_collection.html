                 IBM going to start with the garbage collection overview. Going to start slowly and then go into them the more details with the OpenJ nine GC algorithms. I'm going to finish off with advanced structure called double mapping.

              <li>
                Garbarge collection is a form of automatic memory management. The garbage collect attempts to reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer used by the application. All GC operations are completed in parallel, meaning multiple threads.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Instead of being stopped, the world now is going to be concurrent. Gencon concurrent scavenger is an improvement upon Gencon. The bulk of the work will be done concurrently with the application. Now we have a problem here, because the GC thread is trying to move objects while mutators are trying to access those same objects.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The road pause is divided into little increments. Only 30% of the time is going to be dedicated to the GC. A little bit of GC work here, here and here, and here until it's done.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The right barrier that I mentioned to you was snapshot at the beginning. It causes a lot of floating garbage because the barrier is actually performed before the store. If we didn't have a barrier, this will be the resulting object graph and we would erroneously collect object D.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                DC policy is balanced. PGC stands for partial garbage collection. GMP is a global marking phase. It updates PGC information so that PGC can do its work more effectively. Balance provides significant rendition.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 arraylets are a cleverer way to store larger rates in a region based GC. This array that's divided into regions cannot work with APIs that require a contiguous representation of this array. That's where double mapping comes in. What's next? Off heap where we'll store large objects at a secondary heap.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                This is a quick GC policy guide. Different policies are going to have different throughput and different gcpuzzles. There's no perfect fits, no perfect GC that fits all workloads. If you want a GC that has perfect throughput and you don't care about puzzles at all, you should go with the perfect stop.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Verbose GC option is that you can actually visualize how your memory is behaving under an application with a tool called GcMV. If you're running with Openj nine, you can capture the lock of the GC and visualize that with GcMB. I'll stop here and check it out for any questions.
              </li>
