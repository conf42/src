                Daniel Oatesley is a Devsecops engineer and co director at Punk Security. He talks about how to find secrets in git repos and how to prevent it. Punk Security is also the home of the first devsecops CTF platform.

              <li>
                Secret magpie can detect secrets in git repos or in version control systems. What types of secrets can we leak and where do they live? What can go wrong? How can we better defend and make sure that our secrets don't get leaked.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Secret files can be stored inside a git message. Just because we delete a file doesn't mean that that file immediately disappears. There have been multiple occasions theyre attackers can go and find them. What we should be doing is we just shouldn't be doing it.

                Secret Magpie can be used in multiple ways. It can integrate with GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, or a flat file system. It scans a repository called wrong secrets. By default we limit the number of branches to 20. But if you got more than 20, you can push that up.
