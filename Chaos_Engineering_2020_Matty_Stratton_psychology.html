    <meta property="og:description" content="Chaos Engineering, failure injection, and similar practices have verified benefits to the resilience of systems and infrastructure. But can they provide similar resilience to teams and people? What are the effects and impacts on the humans involved in the systems? This talk will delve into both positive and negative outcomes to all the groups of people involved - including users, engineers, product, and business owners.  Using case studies from organizations where chaos engineering has been implemented, we will explore the changes in attitude that these practices create. This talk will include a brief overview of chaos engineering practices for unfamiliar members of the audience, but the main focus will be on human elements. I will discuss successful implementations, as well as challenges faced in teams where chaos was a “success” from a technical perspective, but contained negative impact for the people involved."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>Chaos Engineering, failure injection, and similar practices have verified benefits to the resilience of systems and infrastructure. But can they provide similar resilience to teams and people? What are the effects and impacts on the humans involved in the systems? This talk will delve into both positive and negative outcomes to all the groups of people involved - including users, engineers, product, and business owners.</p>
<p>Using case studies from organizations where chaos engineering has been implemented, we will explore the changes in attitude that these practices create. This talk will include a brief overview of chaos engineering practices for unfamiliar members of the audience, but the main focus will be on human elements. I will discuss successful implementations, as well as challenges faced in teams where chaos was a “success” from a technical perspective, but contained negative impact for the people involved.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Maddie Stratton is a DevOps advocate for Pagerduty. She founded DevOps days Chicago, which is going to be in September. Sometimes all the things you wanted to say have already been said. The best thing about being the last talk is tying things together.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There's different perceptions around what chaos engineering is and what it provides. When you're doing change inside your organization, it's about understanding the perceptions. What you're trying to do is affect change in an organization. So perception super matters.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The components that make up chef code, one of the elements of those are called recipes. Sometimes words matter, and sometimes these don't, right? Sometimes a word matters when it affects how we think about something.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Use the word root cause when trying to affect change using chaos engineering within organizations. People get nervous about things that seem to imply additional risk. A failure experiment is a great way to normalize the practice of incident response.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The blast radius is what matters. When there's an understanding of the effects, this can actually have a really positive effect on your delivery teams. This really boils down to education being helpful. All you want to do is get in the door to talk about it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Matt Stratton: Never surprise anybody with your chaos experiment. Know what your key business metrics are that are these. And again, we want to build resiliency. At the end of all of this, there are always people. So trying to remember the humans is what matters.
