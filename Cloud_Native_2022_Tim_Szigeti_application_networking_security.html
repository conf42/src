    <meta property="og:description" content="Businesses are increasingly shifting their applications to microservice based architectures, as these support rapid application development with flexibility, stability, portability, and scale. However, microservice architectures present new networking and security challenges that traditional approaches simply cannot meet. For instance, securely interconnecting such microservices dynamically and at scale cannot be done with legacy systems and requires and entirely new approach, a Cloud Native approach.   Similarly too, when it comes to security, it's not enough to secure an interconnection, but also containers, pods, clusters and even APIs. This requires security to be embedded early and pervasively into the entire CI/CD pipeline, and not simply as an after-the-fact consideration. In this session weâ€™ll lay out some of the key problem areas, industry best practices and demonstrate solutions to meet these new and complex requirements. "/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>Businesses are increasingly shifting their applications to microservice based architectures, as these support rapid application development with flexibility, stability, portability, and scale. However, microservice architectures present new networking and security challenges that traditional approaches simply cannot meet. For instance, securely interconnecting such microservices dynamically and at scale cannot be done with legacy systems and requires and entirely new approach, a Cloud Native approach. </p>
<p>Similarly too, when it comes to security, it&rsquo;s not enough to secure an interconnection, but also containers, pods, clusters and even APIs. This requires security to be embedded early and pervasively into the entire CI/CD pipeline, and not simply as an after-the-fact consideration. In this session weâ€™ll lay out some of the key problem areas, industry best practices and demonstrate solutions to meet these new and complex requirements. </p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                This session is all about reimagining application networking and security. I'm going to introduce some new solutions in this space specifically oriented around cloudnative application networking as well as cloud native application security. And finally, I'll summarize everything and just call out some key takeaways.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Traditional application has been very tightly coupled to hardware. An improvement was made here by virtualizing not the hardware, but the operating system itself. This was the approach used by containers, and it's far more efficient, far more effective.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Service meshes present some great advantages, but these, at the same time, as we continue to push these envelope, are presenting challenges themselves. Challenges include the lifecycle management of the mesh itself, observability challenges, as well as multicluster challenges.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A second area of challenge that we want to touch on is observability. We see that when managing a service mesh, your management solution has a number of requirements. We're the only ones that support multi gateways per service mesh per cluster. And these also have support for asynchronous microservices.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Service Mesh manager is an istio distribution that enables you a lot of additional features. Features include mesh management, integrated observability and advanced use cases like traffic management circuit breakers or canary deployments. Show us a demonstration of Cisco service mesh manager.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cisco secure application cloud provides needed capabilities, visibility, policy enforcement, shifts security left. The earlier in the development process, specifically the continuous integration, continuous delivery process, that we can identify security risks or threats, these more efficient and more cost effective and the better for everyone.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cisco application cloud allows users to see top security risks from pods or APIs or vulnerabilities or permissions. The software is available for free. We want everyone to take it for a test drive to see containers, serverless, API and service mesh security in action.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Cisco service mesh manager and Cisco secure application cloud are free to try. These solutions come from cloud native application networking and cloud application security. We really want people to try and adopt and then see the value.
