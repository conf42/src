    <meta property="og:description" content="DevEx is about removing the suck, and the suck is toil, friction, and time-wasting in the day to day life of a developer. Toil is arguably worse than crisis, because a crisis is temporary and firefighting can feel rewarding when it’s over. Toil is more like a death march - an insidious force that eventually leads to burnout.  Automations - guardrails, notifications, actions, or workflows - are the best way to remove toil. I’ll walk you though the best automations and show you how can use them as experiments to enable a loop of continuous learning and improvement"/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>DevEx is about removing the suck, and the suck is toil, friction, and time-wasting in the day to day life of a developer. Toil is arguably worse than crisis, because a crisis is temporary and firefighting can feel rewarding when it’s over. Toil is more like a death march - an insidious force that eventually leads to burnout.</p>
<p>Automations - guardrails, notifications, actions, or workflows - are the best way to remove toil. I’ll walk you though the best automations and show you how can use them as experiments to enable a loop of continuous learning and improvement</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Dylan: This talk is about delegating engineering toil to the. DevOps. Toil is repetitive tasks that your dev team needs to do to get things done right. Dylan: My argument is that automations remove toil. This is how we move our industry forward.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The traits of good automations in relation to developer experience workflow look like. I would argue that today we can do far more exciting and powerful things for developers. Because of all of these things, that have come before, we can start to unlock this higher level of automation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 automation is going to help drive your culture. Tooling helps define culture, right? It helps build these things like guardrails. A good automations enforces these norms and it also allows you to try new things.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Automations should be low lift. Almost nine times out of ten is that I start working on the automation. It's far more complicated than I thought. It takes more time. Whereas if you have low lift automations, you can treat them as an experiment.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The idea of a low lift automations means that you can really do a paradigm shift. You have to be able to use the tools that your teams are using already today in these automations. If you can do these things in a tight loop, you can continuously iterate towards a better and better process.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                For our startup sleuth, question, is that right? Telling a story about something that I think fulfills these categories. A great example of taking all of those traits of an automation and building it into something that if we can adopt really quickly.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are four major buckets, basically, guardrails, notifications, actions and workflows. For those familiar with the state of DevOps and Dora metrics, frequency is something that DevOps teams are trying to maximize. The way that you maximize that is by driving your batch size down.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A good notification is context sensitive. You can use notifications not just to keep people aware of what's going on, but you can nudge behavior in the right direction. Finally, we have workflows. It's how you get work from concept all the way through to launch.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You need to measure experiments, measure and repeat. It's the same with automations. We're on that staircase of automations where we can start to do these things. Not every automation is made for every team. Check out our sleuth automations marketplace.
