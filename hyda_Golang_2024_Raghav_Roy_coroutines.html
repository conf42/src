              <li>
                Raghav Roy: Today we'll be talking about coroutines as generalized subroutines. We'll cover basics, how it all started, and why the concept is important. Some core runtime changes that could be made to support cor outines natively in Go.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A coroutine can do everything a subroutine can. It can suspend itself, run another function, terminate itself, yield back control to its invoker. Can we define coroutines as generalized subroutines?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Coroutines should have been a common pattern that is provided by most languages. But with a few rare exceptions, that's similar. They are actually a limited variant of a coroutine. There's a lack of uniform view of this concept.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Some languages like Python and Kotlin don't actually provide full coroutines. Instead they use asymmetric coroutine mechanisms that provide two control transfer operations. These can be used to implement generators, iterators, all the way up to cooperative multitasking.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Let's start building an API of coroutines in go by using existing Go definitions that's available today. A coroutine can do a bunch of things. It can suspend itself, run another function, terminate itself, yield back control, or suspend itself. Unlike the new Go statement, we are adding new pairings: yield and concurrence.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                As soon as a coroutine stops functioning, just set running to false. All your caller needs to do is, before it resumes its coroutine, just ask, is this coroutine still running? And this can be implemented using this defer funk.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Go rust builds on this use of optimized use, use of an optimized runtime implementation. You can just directly jump between coroutines instead of waiting for it to be scheduled. If this ends up becoming native to go, it would be really interesting to see how developers use this super fast implementation in go in various creative ways.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Having a full coroutine facility in go makes it even more powerful for implementing very robust generalized concurrency patterns. These are the references I highly recommend going through all of these articles and videos.
