              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Haseeb Marjid talks about reproducible and ephemeral development environments with Nix for Golang projects. Nix is a declarative package manager, powered by Nixlang. Talk aimed at those looking to improve developer experience, particularly around consistency of development environments.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                NICS is an ecosystem of tools. We want to have reproducible and ephemeral environments for developers. Current packaging systems all have various flaws. The upsides beat the downsides of Nics, in my opinion.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                With go, we need tooling to aid development. How are we going to create this Nix environment? Don't worry about the syntax of nics. And we want to make sure certain tooling is available in that. Nix can come in and fix a few of our problems.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Nix flakes can output a lot of stuff. They can output build a docker image they can build an ISO, they can create a development shell, which is what we're going to do here. We can leverage flakes and dev shells for installing packages.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                One thing that can really improve the developer experience with NICs is pre commit. With these pre commit hooks you can get some again really fast feedback. Saves us time waiting for CI and save some credits as well.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Everything in Nics is an expression which is quite common for functional programming languages. When we're building packages, what's actually happening? It's a two step process. The derivation is built into a package, and that is what has a side effect on our machine where stuff is actually getting installed.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Nix flakes basically take state on our system and kind of put them into code. With this flake lock file, we lock our stuff to specific revisions. flakes improve reproducibility across our system by locking our dependencies. But do note they are an experimental feature.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                One of the final topics we're going to touch on is CI. We want to leverage Nix's cacheability and sharing dependencies. So it shares dependencies between different stages and different jobs. And this is kind of what it looks like, eleven and a half minutes total runtime.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Nick O'Brien talks about Docker in terms of like as a development environment. Give both a go, see which one you prefer. But I think I found nics a lot easier. A few things you can look at in your own time to further use nics.
