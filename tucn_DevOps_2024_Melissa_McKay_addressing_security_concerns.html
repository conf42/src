            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Melissa McKay is a developer advocate at JFrog. She will address security concerns in every stage of the software supply chain. My contact information is here if you have any questions.

              <li>
                Damien Curry is the business development technical director at F five and with Nginx originally. We discussed the journey of an application from the very beginnings of development all the way to production. There are many reasons to be concerned with security.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Data breaches are a huge motivator for hackers due to their immense value. The global average cost of a data breach was $4.45 million in 2023. Here's an essay on how to write insecure code.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In this 1117 o, three commercial code bases across 17 different industries were scanned. Each one of these red triangles represents an opportunity for an attacker to disrupt. There are places you really do need to take extra care to protect your supply chain.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Most projects have a collection of dependencies, and they include open source or publicly available packages as well as internal packages. NPM requests inform about internal package names. Using an artifact management system, you can specify internal package requests to only be resolved with internal repositories.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The problem has more to do with managing open source packages and libraries themselves. It illustrates a trap that we fall into when we solely rely on public repositories for our builds. The best example of where those problem rears its head is the leftpad incident.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A lot of docker images rely on base images. Make sure you understand where your base images are coming from. There's no tag or Shaw identifier. Even a tag isn't enough to pin an exact version. I would pin that version down.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 Lines two through four are packages that are updating packages in the base image. Some don't have line three. There's no version number at all. Line four is a particularly old version. Could be bad. It could have a vulnerability in it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                This is just a curl script. Rather than rely on an external resource like this, the best thing you can do is to bring it in to your internal environment and manage it there. Make sure that updates you have control of when it's updated.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                In 2022, cystic puts out this report every year. Out of 3 million containers they were observing, 76% were run as root. There's now 83%. Is there any hope? Let's talk about some solutions.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Don't rely solely on public repos. Save every artifact that you need for your builds in a local artifact management system. Manage permissions so important. New vulnerabilities are discovered all of the time. It's important to stay up with the latest.
              </li>
