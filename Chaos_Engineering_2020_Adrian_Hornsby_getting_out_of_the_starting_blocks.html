    <meta property="og:description" content="Architectures are growing increasingly distributed and hard to understand. As a result, software systems have become extremely difficult to debug and test, which increases the risk of failure. With these new challenges, chaos engineering ha become attractive to many organizations as a mechanism for underling the behavior of systems under expected circumstances.  Whilst interest is growing, few have managed to build sustainable chaos engineering practices. In this talk, I will review the state of chaos engineering, the issues customers are facing, based on my learning as an AWS Solution Architect and Technologist focusing on Chaos Engineering and explain why I started to build tools to help with failure injection."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>Architectures are growing increasingly distributed and hard to understand. As a result, software systems have become extremely difficult to debug and test, which increases the risk of failure. With these new challenges, chaos engineering ha become attractive to many organizations as a mechanism for underling the behavior of systems under expected circumstances.</p>
<p>Whilst interest is growing, few have managed to build sustainable chaos engineering practices. In this talk, I will review the state of chaos engineering, the issues customers are facing, based on my learning as an AWS Solution Architect and Technologist focusing on Chaos Engineering and explain why I started to build tools to help with failure injection.</p>

              Summary

            <ul>
              
              <li>
                There are patterns that you can see in what's blocking people from actually adopting some of those cool practices. One of them is chaos engineering. This talk is really a collection of kind of tips and tricks to help you get started in your journey.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The first problem with chaos engineering is in the title itself. Don't call it chaos engineering. And it's been expected today is actually call it engineering. Good intentions don't work. We need to care more about our customers.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                An undone cord was invented by Toyota in the early 19 two. It lets anyone on the factory floor, if they see a defect, can pull the cord. We took that principle into customers service. If good intentions don't work, work what does?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A lot of it has nothing to do with human. It's about processes, detecting things and the same third party providers. Technology is a lot more complicated than just tools and processes. Have a way to really measure and to look at the past.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When you adopt chaos engineering practices, you're never ever going to go from zero to 100 in your company. Never choose the best team. You have to find the right Troy and horse, which is going to be spreading the good virus inside the company. And the essence of chaos engineering is confidence.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The fifth is do introduce chaos engineering. It changes the way developers think because it triggers something in the mind that actually there's more than just working. When you hire people, teach them how to break stuff. This is probably going to be the wow moment in your company.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                People assume work and that goes with managed services. On AWS you have a region, you have three aws to have your application to be fault tolerant. People assume an AZ just never has problem. But it does. Even though they're isolated, sometimes they do.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Chaos engineering is a set of an intersection between culture, tools and processes. The only thing I can tell is try to make these tools uniform for the entire company. Focus on few and these are the ones that are going to give you most gains.
              </li>
