              <li>
                An incident is any unplanned disruption or event that requires immediate attention or action. The main goal of incidents response is to replace chaos with calm. Even with disorganized response, you'll likely still find a solution. Automation is also very important.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The incident command system was developed as part of wildfire response in southern California. In 2004, the National Incident Management system, or NIMS, was established by FEMA and is now the standard for all emergency management by public agencies in the United States.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                When defining incidents, it's important to codify what constitutes a major incident similar to an incident. It needs to be defined in a way that can be used across teams in your organization. You might want to have a metric or two that you tie to that.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Timing is a surprise, so there's little to no warning and that the time of the response matters. It also requires mobilizing a team of the correct responders to resolve. Anyone needs to be able to trigger an incident at any time. We need to switch from peacetime to wartime.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The lifecycle of an incident or its steps are you have triage, mobilize, resolve, and prevent. In order for these steps to happen relatively smoothly, you want to make sure you have some roles defined.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The incident commander is basically running the incident. The deputy might help with other tasks like liaisons, or the scribe. And then there are all the subject matter experts. These are the people with the relevant expertise for whatever the latency, outage, breach is.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A typical sequence of events is something is triggered either by monitoring or by human that goes to a subject matter expert. The role scale down. Maybe your incident commander and other roles can be rolled up in a way that's relatively effective. If you notice that a pairing isn't working, don't keep using it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The incident commander role ensures the incident response is calm and organized because they're making the calls. Incident commander also makes sure to assign tasks to a specific person. Making a wrong decision in this situation is better than making no decision.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Some tips before new incident commanders introduce yourself on the call with your name. Avoid acronyms because you don't know what different type teams are doing. Speak slowly and with purpose on the calls. Kick people off if they're being disruptive. In summary, for the incidents commander, everyone is focused.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                How do I prepare to manage incident response team? Step one, ensure explicit processes and expectations exist. Step two, practice running a major incident as a team. Don't neglect the post mortem when things are fresh.
              </li>
