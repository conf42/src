                Security, chaos, engineering, how to fix things you didn't know were broken. The things I'll be talking about while sounding like a job for offsec people. The goal is to understand how things work before you a team to break things.

                Verizon Dvir regularly shows misconfigurations as the primary cause of breaches, not vulnerabilities. Basic fundamentals are still difficult even without the smug jerks clumsily saying just turn it on. We need to understand what we're trying to protect.

                Secure today does not mean secure tomorrow. Trying to prevent failure doesn't work, and it's likely never going to work. Everything's going to fail at some point, so it's our jobs to understand how they'll fail and plan accordingly. Key performance indicators help set benchmarks, measure progress, set business goals.

                Most adversaries look extremely similar to each other. Don't use actual malware because that can ruin your day. You should be able to see layers of defense in action. Getting started is probably one of the hardest parts.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We should not settle for 80 or 90% visibility. Everything else needs to be tested, identified and measured. In experimentation, you're learning about how things actually work. Knowing that your product works enables better decisions when it comes to renewations.

                Work is really all about making friends in the right places to help you get the things you want done. Security chaos engineering helps you ask better questions. Success means more work because that's really what life's all about.
