              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Madhumita, product lead at Startree, will give the talk on troubleshooting real time business metrics. She will give a walkthrough of real life use case and how to troubleshoot that, a live demonstration of that. And then he will touch base on some of the benefits and advantages and we will open up the floor for Q A.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Real time business metrics are the metrics that you are monitoring to identify any issues. In the era of generative AI, data is everywhere and the data volume and velocity is becoming very, very important. To troubleshooting in real time in a smart and efficient way, you need to have good quality data.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Rati third eye helps with real time metrics, monitoring almost near real time and anomaly detection of large and complex time series data. Suvdeep will give a live demo of how you can use this tool to troubleshoot in real time.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Shubhadeep: I'm going to walk you through a couple of use cases around anomaly detection. Show you under the hood how thirdeye works and how are we trying to tackle some of these issues. Thirdeye not only does a basic level of alerting, but it also is really good at multidimensional alerting.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Thirdeye helps you figure out what is an anomaly, or rather helps you in figuring out what could have caused this particular anomaly. Thirdeye also gives you an event framework to work with. And Thirdeye tries to put a lot of these information in front of you so that you can make an informed decision.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Third eye can really do a deep drill down and try to find all sorts of correlations and causations around it. Third eye can make an informed decision as to what your anomalies can be related to. That can be reason for that particular incident.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                How your data is organized in Apache Pinot or any kind of these databases is important. Certain systems are capable of handling aggregations in a much more faster and more efficient way. Thirdeye is able to leverage these capabilities to stay performant across the entire vertical.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Third Eye has a very sophisticated anomaly detection flow, and this is what we use to kind of model alerts. Most of the tools that we have shared here is available in the community edition. The Enterprise version is also available for you to play with.
