    <meta property="og:description" content="Remember when we were at school, and people said - "Actively listening in class guarantees 50% prep for the upcoming test"? The same goes for being proactive at work in ways that will instantly prepare you to manage incidents better (at night or in general).  In this talk, I will lay out the foundations of incident management, including key questions that if you'll be able to answer - You will be able to easily manage incidents, no matter the time and place. I will also show the best practices I've finalized over the years that helped me get a clear vision of how to manage production incidents in the quickest & efficient way possible.  Embracing the tips I'll give you will guarantee you'll not only talk the talk but also walk the walk when it comes to incident management."/>

<p>Remember when we were at school, and people said - &ldquo;Actively listening in class guarantees 50% prep for the upcoming test&rdquo;?
The same goes for being proactive at work in ways that will instantly prepare you to manage incidents better (at night or in general).</p>
<p>In this talk, I will lay out the foundations of incident management, including key questions that if you&rsquo;ll be able to answer - You will be able to easily manage incidents, no matter the time and place.
I will also show the best practices I&rsquo;ve finalized over the years that helped me get a clear vision of how to manage production incidents in the quickest &amp; efficient way possible.</p>
<p>Embracing the tips I&rsquo;ll give you will guarantee you&rsquo;ll not only talk the talk but also walk the walk when it comes to incident management.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Hila Fish is a senior DevOps engineer. She has 15 years of experience in the tech industry, which means a lot of production incidents. She will show you how to take a proactive approach to managing incidents.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Incidents management is a set of procedures and actions taken to resolve critical incidents. Business mindset is needed to grasp the overall impact of incidents and mitigate damages. A structured process can lead to incidents production, improved, meantime to resolution and eventually to cost reduction.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                During an incident you should really keep calm and ask yourselves, and I'm also going to address the keep calm further on in the presentation. The next pillar is investigation and diagnosis. The last pillar is resolve and recovery. Choose the fastest solution without compromising system's health and stability.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Next up is are there any action items needed after the issue got resolved? Is a relevant incident runbook in place? If it's outdated, maybe it needs to be updated. Could I help prevent similar incidents from happening again?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                War room is when you have more than three, four people handling an issue. We should really have an incident manager that really divides the work and tell people what to do. This person should be calm and collected and see things clearly. It should be kept minimal and dynamic.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are a lot of qualities that you should have when you handle an incident. Think on your feet, differentiate between relevant and non relevant information. Be humble. If you're stuck, ask for help. A methodical walk will help you gain faster incident resolution.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The proactive approach after the fact, after an incident took place, looks something like that. Document it in an on call shift handoff, which is a summary that I will post in my team's channel. Postmortem notes. Open a jira or a Monday ticket and fix it to prevent the next incident.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Identifying services, escalation points on a day to day basis will save time and money on incident management. Learning application flows is very, very important. Be a go to person as they say. Less downtime means business success.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
