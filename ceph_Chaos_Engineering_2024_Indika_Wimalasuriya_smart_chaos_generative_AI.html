              Summary

            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Chaos Engineering 2024 is about leveraging generative AI to build autonomous chaos engineering workflows. I have used AWS Partyrock to implement some of these use cases. Finally, I'll wrap it up with some of the best practices and pitfalls based on my experience.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The distributed systems are very complex. If there's an issue in any of these layers, it will have a ripple effect on other layers. Bugs can appear anytime, right? So why are we not able to make management of distributed systems easy?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Generative AI is nothing but the ability of AI models to create new content or create original content. One of the top use cases is the text generation. These models are really helping us to make a difference in our operations.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We want to do chaos engineering in a methodical way. There's nothing like doing a chaos engineering a chaos way, and that will not give you any value. The first task is discover, discover your services. When you are going through the chaos engineering process, you have to measure everything.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So here I'm looking at ten stages, ten step into the chaos engineering workflow. How we can actually leverage generative AI to provide solutions to this area. One is discovery. Another is understanding blast radiance. And then about monitoring and analysis.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The idea is that that is why we need generative AI. So we don't need really SMEs to be involved all the time. This is the architecture diagram of an electronic vehicle charging system. We are going to use this as our base and see how we can automate some of the stage.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                AWS party rock is one of innovative the AI play pen which AWS has released. I asked generative AI to come up with system dependencies. Using large language models, ensure that you are using the right model and that will give you more accurate data.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The next aspect is understanding the steady state of this application or the system. So our generative AI is able to look at the architecture diagram and then define what is good mean without even human involved.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So moving on, this is about hypothesis creation. What I'm doing is giving the architecture diagram link and I have asked generative AI model to generate the hypothesis. Once you have the experiments, it's about understanding blast radius. This is again helping us massively to cut down human involvement.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We are able to use generative AI, every aspects of our chaos engineering workflow. We can use it to discover our services, understand the dependencies and it will come up with a hypothesis. Once the experiments have been executed, we can monitor using observability tools. This is what I call the smart chaos.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                I'd like to finish my session. It was wonderful being part of Chaos Engineering 2024. I hope you enjoy my presentation and there are a lot of other presentations. Have a nice day.
