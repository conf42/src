    <meta property="og:description" content="Technology drives value and innovation in every organization. At Google Cloud, we have learned a lot about what it takes to build and scale high-performing technology teams. Our own lived experience combined with a multi-year research program led by the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) team can be used to help you and your team transform into a high-performing technology team. This talk will dive into some of the findings of the 2022 DORA research program. We will couple these findings with stories from the field about how teams are putting these ideas into practice. There will be success stories and cautionary tales: let's all learn from one another. Spoiler alert! The best teams focus on getting better at getting better. You can do this, too!"/>

<p>Technology drives value and innovation in every organization. At Google Cloud, we have learned a lot about what it takes to build and scale high-performing technology teams. Our own lived experience combined with a multi-year research program led by the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) team can be used to help you and your team transform into a high-performing technology team.
This talk will dive into some of the findings of the 2022 DORA research program.
We will couple these findings with stories from the field about how teams are putting these ideas into practice. There will be success stories and cautionary tales: let&rsquo;s all learn from one another.
Spoiler alert! The best teams focus on getting better at getting better. You can do this, too!</p>

                The 2022 accelerate state of DevOps report. One of the key findings from the report is that context matters. Let's bring the report to life through story time.

                Nathan: Let's go back to December 10, 2021. Where were you when you heard about log for show? Nathan: Your Friday was looking like this, but then it changed. Would you hold my coffee?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A vulnerability in logging software affected production systems. The incident commander went through the five stages of grief, denial, bargaining, acceptance and action. He used one of his favorite tools, the Uda loop, to get the team to work.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                About 400 different production applications were impacted by the vulnerability. The two most critical applications were the order management system and the ecommerce front end. By Monday morning, we'd identified two applications that were most critical.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There are about 27 different microservices that make up this application. There was no automated build process or testing. It took us the entire weekend to identify which systems to prioritize for remediation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The changes for this site have to go through a change approval board who only meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The cab suggested building off on any updates to production until the log for J releases stabilized. The last one wasn't even released until the 20 eigth of December. 20 plus days. That sounds rough.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                What about the order management system? That system is the heart of the business. Over the previous two years, the OMS team was able to go from quarterly releases to deploying updates to the system on a weekly basis. How do we help the website team have more of an experience like the ordermanagement team in the future?

              </li>

                Dora is an ongoing research program that's been around for about eight years. The research focuses on capabilities that span across technical, process, and cultural capabilities. Through our predictive analysis, we're able to show that these capabilities are predictive of or drive software delivery and operations. Investment takes time and practice.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Culture was one of the top predictors of whether or not a team was embracing these security practices. Having good continuous integration and good security is a real driver for your organization. Adoption of the technical aspects of software supply chain security appears to hinge on the use of good, continuous integration practices.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The idea is that you start with the outcomes that you want to improve and then work backwards to find the capabilities where you need to get better. To really affect change in our team, we cannot change it overnight. We have to start out slow.

                Amanda Lewis: I'm a developer advocate with Google Cloud, focused on the Dora research program. In September, we also launched a community of practice around Dora. We hope that all of you out there will come and join us. Before you go, make sure you grab your very own copy of the 2022 accelerate state of DevOps report.
