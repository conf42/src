    <meta property="og:description" content="A smart person learns from their own mistakes, but a truly wise person learns from the mistakes of others.   When launching our product, we wanted to learn as much as possible about typical pains in our ecosystem, and did so by reviewing many post-mortems (100+!) to discover the recurring patterns, anti-patterns, and root causes of typical outages in Kubernetes-based systems.    In this talk we have aggregated for you the insights we gathered, and in particular will review the most obvious DON'Ts and some less obvious ones, that may help you prevent your next production outage by learning from others' real world (horror) stories."/>

<p>A smart person learns from their own mistakes, but a truly wise person learns from the mistakes of others. </p>
<p>When launching our product, we wanted to learn as much as possible about typical pains in our ecosystem, and did so by reviewing many post-mortems (100+!) to discover the recurring patterns, anti-patterns, and root causes of typical outages in Kubernetes-based systems.  </p>
<p>In this talk we have aggregated for you the insights we gathered, and in particular will review the most obvious DON&rsquo;Ts and some less obvious ones, that may help you prevent your next production outage by learning from others&rsquo; real world (horror) stories.</p>

                Today we're going to talk to you about what we've learned from working with companies and experiencing and reading a lot of Kubernetes postmortems. We'll also talk about what are the best practices in order to avoid taking your cluster down or introducing security hazards.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Shimon Barki is one of the co founders and the CEO of the Tree. The company is aimed to prevent misconfigurations from reaching production. They use an open source Cli. that scans the Kubernetes manifests and helm charts. Today they will publish 100 plus postmortems.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Shimon: We are going to do it in my very own. Private game show. What are the prizes? What can I win? It's a million dollars. If you're curious about it, just contact me later. I'll tell you what you wanted to won or did not win.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 Kubernetes shows you a default cron job configuration. With Cron job you always mix up the scheduler and the configuration. The problem is not the scheduling but the concurrency policy. Never ever trust the default configuration.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                This is another cron job configuration. What's the mistake here? It's incorrect yaml structure. We always want to make sure that our yaml Structure in our Kubernetes resources is valid. It's not using the default behavior that was not the behavior that you should have used.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                One of the developer set a star in their ingress resource and just immediately took their entire cluster down. The lesson that we learned from target here is how important it is to delegate the knowledge from the DevOps team to the developers teams. You need to educate them and give them the tools in order to do the right thing.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Blue Metador blew their cluster with a pod that didn't have any limits. It can really happen to anyone. The way to go is to automate and have automated tests during your development process.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Three main tools that you can use in order to use policies in your organization. We'll talk about confidence and gatekeeper, which are based on OPA, OPA under the hood. And we'll also talk about our own, the tree application which is also open source. The important thing is to think where would be the most suitable place to use these tools in your pipeline.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Conftest enables you to write tests on any structured file. Any structured file can be Yaml, XMl, Docker, JSoN, anything. Also allows you to push and pull your policies to a docker registry. It's really simple and I really like that it's in the CI pipeline.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The tree is basically the same as confidence and gatekeeper only. We have predefined rules and rule packs that you can enable and disable. And then finally it has a centralized management mechanism. I really hope that this will inspire you to start thinking about your policies.

              </li>
