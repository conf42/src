                How to thrive at your first dev job. Five tips for success. Riaz Virani is a freelance web developer. You can read more of his stuff at Riazv me.

                I want to take a second and have you introspect a little bit. Think about what your experience was like when you did join the industry. I want you to channel that energy because it'll help you empathize and help other people on your team as they're joining.

                Our character Ruby musters up the courage to go join a software bootcamp. She soaked in a ton of knowledge and information. She does everything in her power to get a job. Some of you may have had a struggle to get to this part.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A number of people, especially now that I've been doing this for like twelve years, really struggle when they join a team. There's a lot of commonalities in the struggle that first year devs experience across companies. These are some of the tips.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A lot of junior developers, they just don't ask enough for help when they get stuck. Don't put your teammates in a pedestal. You cannot wait forever to ask for help. The final tip is more of a tactical tip. It's called pseudocode is your friend.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You're going to write a lot of mediocre code as you improve. That doesn't mean you're bad, it just means you're learning. The thing within your control is kind of how you respond and the answer isn't be perfect.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Sometimes boot camps teaching way too many things or people on their own. Focus on one specific technology that your team needs help with and then specific expertise will give you the credibility and the ability over time to be productive.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Don't put your teammates on a pedestal. Your job is to communicate about the code across your team. Tell the senior developer what you found and ask for clarification. The earlier you can communicate, the better benefit you'll have.
