    <meta property="og:description" content="Every organisation needs quality processes in place to ensure the software it produces is maintainable and satisfies customer needs. But what to do when your organisation doesn't have, or can't have, a dedicated QA team? You're in luck. This talk covers everything you'll need to know to not only adopt quality processes within your development teams, but to create an organisational culture conducive to releasing reliable, maintainable, and consistently high quality software."/>

<p>Every organisation needs quality processes in place to ensure the software it produces is maintainable and satisfies customer needs. But what to do when your organisation doesn&rsquo;t have, or can&rsquo;t have, a dedicated QA team? You&rsquo;re in luck. This talk covers everything you&rsquo;ll need to know to not only adopt quality processes within your development teams, but to create an organisational culture conducive to releasing reliable, maintainable, and consistently high quality software.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Dana Scheider talks about software quality management when you don't have dedicated QA staff. Quality management in this model is focused on finding and fixing defects, not on overall suitability of the product for its intended use. The knowledge that qas have is essential and needs to be imparted to development team.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Total quality management is a quality management philosophy widely adopted in japanese engineering. In TQM, everyone is responsible for quality and everyone is empowered to make decisions on behalf of quality. The final key component is continuous improvement of products and processes.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                TQM is focused on all elements of design and development, so you're not just fixing bugs. Quality is always the responsibility of the entire organization. Some companies are going to have an easier time adopting TQM than others.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Even junior engineers should feel comfortable asking questions and critiquing their own and others work. Collaboration is key to quality management under TQM and stands in opposition to competition. True culture of accountability understands that and is focused on enabling and empowering people to do their jobs well.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You need to communicate regularly with product and design. Robust code review is really important, and I can't overstate this. Using agile rituals and practices greatly enhances quality.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                People should be comfortable talking about what could still go wrong despite all their best efforts. Total quality management makes quality the responsibility of every person in the organization. Adopting TQM requires allocation of resources and full management support. Dev teams can make simple changes to their process to improve quality.
              </li>
