    <meta property="og:description" content="We all encountered a “Broken Window” theory in practice. The original idea was that if someone breaks a window in a neighbourhood and this window is not repaired right away, the entire area will start getting messier at an accelerated rate.  The same theory is also true for Software Development. How many times have you looked at a legacy system with no code coverage, and decided not to write any tests because ""this is how we do things here""? These bad practices behave just like those ""Broken Windows."" They cause our code to degrade and become unusable.  In this talk, we discuss how to break away from bad development practices and how to address major gaps in your legacy and current systems. We look at ways to successfully lead-by-example and to introduce refactoring culture into your team and organization. We cover tips and tricks that help to improve the development culture and to emphasize the general health of the codebase. "/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>We all encountered a “Broken Window” theory in practice. The original idea was that if someone breaks a window in a neighbourhood and this window is not repaired right away, the entire area will start getting messier at an accelerated rate.</p>
<p>The same theory is also true for Software Development. How many times have you looked at a legacy system with no code coverage, and decided not to write any tests because &ldquo;&rdquo;this is how we do things here&rdquo;&ldquo;? These bad practices behave just like those &ldquo;&rdquo;Broken Windows.&rdquo;&rdquo; They cause our code to degrade and become unusable.</p>
<p>In this talk, we discuss how to break away from bad development practices and how to address major gaps in your legacy and current systems. We look at ways to successfully lead-by-example and to introduce refactoring culture into your team and organization. We cover tips and tricks that help to improve the development culture and to emphasize the general health of the codebase.</p>

              Summary

            <ul>

                You can enable your DevOps for reliability with chaos native. Create your free account at Chaos native Litmus Cloud. Today I'll be talking about legacy systems and how to fix them.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Today's presentation is about legacy systems or as I call things, session fixing broken Windows code team and you. I'll talk about union engineering and quality, why hybrid engineering has been so important to legacy systems developments. And just going beyond code, I'll also talk about teams and about you as an engineer.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 broken window theory is that you're trying to focus and never forget about small things. It's broken teams and it's broken you because you're working on that broken software. Fixing these broken windows of software is where our focus will be today.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 legacy code is simply code without tests. To add tests, you have to refactor your code. Changing the code means working on new features, bug fixes. Do it worth the effort of adding tests and refactoring?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                What exactly is legacy code? You have to keep in mind these chia pet pattern. Avoid glued patterns, meaning things like singletones, very non thread safe way of writing software. Delegation is a great pattern or builder patterns for legacy systems. Same rules will apply anywhere.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Test is what comes to our rescue. They behavior driven and they are increasing our confidence. Most important things are you have to know your domain. Is domain driven design useful in tests? Of course it is.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                 Approval testing is the actual application of domain enforcing unit tests. You're trying to evolve validation as you progress, as your code progresses. It gives you high level confidence, higher than the regular unit tests, but they are more pricey.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                There is a framework called quick theory for Java or JSON schema validator for schema driven tests. It basically gives you that adding to positive integers gives you positive integer. That's exactly what approval testing does. It's not just asserting that true is true or false is false.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Backstop js might be a good proof of concept for screenshot testing. End to end task tests are a bit more complex and they are again user centric. An overall conclusion is that you have to focus and keep it on user dimensions.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Common design pitfalls that we all face as a team. Domain driven design is how we're dealing with those common design pitfalls. The importance of a team work cannot be overestimated. Instead of no design evolution, you have design evolution and just having stagnation.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                The idea of ubiquitous language means that engineers, your tests and your domain experts all speak the same language. Design guidance that you have to provide to yourself and your users goes to context mapping. Communication is essential in domain driven design and it's essential with broken Windows legacy systems.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Work is just work. Don't work all hours of these day. Spend some time for yourself and for your family. Mobile devices are often to blame. Noise interruptions are also a problem. Establish office hours when you're in your expert.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                How broken code and broken teams lead to broken individuals. What about your colleagues, your family and yourself? Stress has purpose. There is a short term stress and there's long term stress. It's important to talk about mental fitness when it comes to dealing with stress.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Overwork and long hours, it's creatures of habits. It's basically working too much, having unreasonable expectations. Keep focused and use benefits like unlimited vacation or health reimbursements. Ultimately, it leads to lost passion.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                To stick to your ways to improve yourself, you have to find inspiration, find purpose. Find a specialist, talk to a professional, experiment what works for you, and share your experiences with others. Lead by example. Your team will change if you change yourself.
