              <li>
                Flow engineering is how to level up your team one map at a time. We're going to look at constraints in the workflow, what's holding us down. We'll connect those constraints to actual factors inside of our organization. And we'll wrap all that up into what I call flow roadmap.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Use whiteboarding to understand the current state of a project. Use value stream mapping to lay out all the activities from start to finish for a given workflow. And then look at investigations as options to figure out how to navigate the landscape.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                A lot of people struggle with identifying a value stream. Looking at working backwards from that outcome helps us isolate a single stream. Third stage is to look at that constraint, that hotspot, and break it down. How might we improve the workflow around these things?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Flow engineering is an excellent method for optimizing collective flow. You really can't do the personal without the collective. We balance collective flow with personal flow. Often, what we'll see is we can do more with less when we optimize a workflow.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                People are going to start talking about this a lot now because this just showed up at the very top of the thoughtworks radar. Everyone who talks about massive performance improvements talks about looking at the end to end flow. Flow engineering is really going to ride this wave.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Mapping is so valuable and so important working together in this way on a visual medium. It's incredibly customizable and it's entirely bespoke for whatever context. It works just as well remotely where everyone's in a different time zone. There's an ebook and an email course that is entirely self guided at flow.
