    <meta property="og:description" content="The evolution of cloud native technologies and the need to scale engineering, leading organizations to restructure their teams and embrace new architectural approaches. Being a cloud native engineer is fun! But also challenging. These days engineers aren’t just writing code and building packages but are expected to know how to write the relevant Kubernetes resource YAMLs, use HELM, containerize their app and ship it to a variety of environments. It isn't enough to know it at a high level. Being a cloud native engineer means that it’s not enough to just know the programming language you are working on well, but you should also keep adapting your knowledge and understanding of the cloud native technologies you are depending on. Engineers are now required to write services that are just one of many other services that usually solve a certain customer problem.  In order to enhance engineers' cloud native knowledge and best practices to deal with production incidents, we started a series of workshops called: “On-Call like a king” which aims to enhance engineers knowledge while responding to production incidents. Every workshop is a set of chaos engineering experiments that simulate real production incidents and the engineers practice on investigating, resolving and finding the root cause.  In this talk I will share how we got there, what we are doing and how it improves our engineering teams expertise."/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>The evolution of cloud native technologies and the need to scale engineering, leading organizations to restructure their teams and embrace new architectural approaches.
Being a cloud native engineer is fun! But also challenging. These days engineers aren’t just writing code and building packages but are expected to know how to write the relevant Kubernetes resource YAMLs, use HELM, containerize their app and ship it to a variety of environments. It isn&rsquo;t enough to know it at a high level. Being a cloud native engineer means that it’s not enough to just know the programming language you are working on well, but you should also keep adapting your knowledge and understanding of the cloud native technologies you are depending on. Engineers are now required to write services that are just one of many other services that usually solve a certain customer problem.</p>
<p>In order to enhance engineers&rsquo; cloud native knowledge and best practices to deal with production incidents, we started a series of workshops called: “On-Call like a king” which aims to enhance engineers knowledge while responding to production incidents. Every workshop is a set of chaos engineering experiments that simulate real production incidents and the engineers practice on investigating, resolving and finding the root cause.</p>
<p>In this talk I will share how we got there, what we are doing and how it improves our engineering teams expertise.</p>

                How do we utilize chaos engineering to become better cloud native engineers? It's a series of workshops that are composed in Siren. Originally meant to bring more confidence to engineers during their own call shifts. But later on it became a great playground to train the cloud native engineering practices.

                The evolution of cloud native technologies and the need to scale engineering is leading organizations to restructure the teams and embrace new architectural approaches. Engineers these days are closer to the product and the customer needs. But there is still a long way to go and companies are still struggling.

                As part of transitioning to being more cloud native distributed, engineers face more challenges. Deep systems are complex and you should know how to deal with them. Cyren is holding workshops to train engineers on cloud native practices.

                A bit on our call procedure before we proceed. We have weekly engineering shifts and ANOC team that monitors our system 24/7. Alert playbooks that assist these on call engineer while responding to an event. First priority is to get the system back to a normal state.

              <li>
                The workshop sessions are composed into three parts. The session starts with a quick introduction and motivation. Make sure that the audience are aligned on the flow and the agenda. The overall session shouldn't be longer than 60 minutes.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Our oncology being workshop sessions are usually trying to be close to real life production scenarios as possible. By simulating real production scenarios, such real life scenarios enables the engineers to build confidence while taking care of real production incident. The discussions around the incidents is a great place for knowledge sharing.
