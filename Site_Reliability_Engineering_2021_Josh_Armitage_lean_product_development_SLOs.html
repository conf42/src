    <meta property="og:description" content="* How can you strip over-processing out of your value stream? * How can you understand and communicate what "good enough" looks like? * How can you systematically challenge and remove assumptions from you consumers?  In supporting enterprises in DevOps & agile transformations across three continents, I discovered a common theme, stories talk of what is to be enabled, but not how well it needs to perform.  Recently, upon joining a platform team drowning under the weight of their backlog, I experimented with SLOs being the beating heart of our product development flow.  To do this, we: * Revisited all previous core usecases and determined meaningful SLIs and SLOs * Made SLOs an inherent part of defining features * Built a lightweight infrastructure to translate technical changes to business events * Made a dashboard to transparently broadcast our SLOs * Made SLOs be the core of conversations with our consumers  By doing this, we: * Removed assumptions from consumers, driving more meaningful conversations about value * Created a beachhead for a more data driven culture * Created a common understanding of what "good enough" looked like * Became better focused on maximising value delivery, over redundant gold plating of features  You'll learn: * How to adopt an SLO driven product development flow * From the mistakes we made along the way * Tips and tricks for defining SLOs for low frequency usecases * How to drive more impactful conversations"/>

<ul>
<li>How can you strip over-processing out of your value stream?</li>
<li>How can you understand and communicate what &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; looks like?</li>
<li>How can you systematically challenge and remove assumptions from you consumers?</li>
</ul>
<p>In supporting enterprises in DevOps &amp; agile transformations across three continents, I discovered a common theme, stories talk of what is to be enabled, but not how well it needs to perform.</p>
<p>Recently, upon joining a platform team drowning under the weight of their backlog, I experimented with SLOs being the beating heart of our product development flow.</p>
<p>To do this, we:
* Revisited all previous core usecases and determined meaningful SLIs and SLOs
* Made SLOs an inherent part of defining features
* Built a lightweight infrastructure to translate technical changes to business events
* Made a dashboard to transparently broadcast our SLOs
* Made SLOs be the core of conversations with our consumers</p>
<p>By doing this, we:
* Removed assumptions from consumers, driving more meaningful conversations about value
* Created a beachhead for a more data driven culture
* Created a common understanding of what &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; looked like
* Became better focused on maximising value delivery, over redundant gold plating of features</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll learn:
* How to adopt an SLO driven product development flow
* From the mistakes we made along the way
* Tips and tricks for defining SLOs for low frequency usecases
* How to drive more impactful conversations</p>

            <h3>
              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Today I'm going to talk through how you can do lean product delivery through SLO. We're going to be talking lean theory, product development, and SRe all in about 25, 30 minutes. One of the powerful things about slos is they convert expectations into concrete outcomes.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                I'm the AWS practice lead at Contino. I'm an AWS APN ambassador, which, if ever, means I do lots of stuff like this. And kind of most poignantly for this talk is I'm a bit of a lean junkie. I love kind of diving into everything about it.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                We're going to be talking specifically about AWS landing zones. Today we're just going to look at one thing and that's account vending. Taking an SLO first approach really helps take some of the ambiguity out of this.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                One of the core concepts of lean is this idea of waste. Defects, overproduction, waiting, unused talent, extra processing, transportation, motion and inventory. Product management is tension management, and that's the tension between delivery and consumers.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                An SLO defines how frequently can I fail of every 100 or 1000 or 10,000 requests. And then you get down to an SLA, which is defining the penalty for exceeding the failure goal. In order to have an SLO, you have to have can SLI.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                An SLO is a goal that you're trying to hit. It should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time boxed. What do we think is realistic and attainable?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Maintaining systems at three nines is ten times harder than maintaining a system at two nines. You want to negotiate the minimum slos for your features. By tracking how you are working and what the ongoing maintenance burden is on your team, you can make better decisions.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Another thing that comes with SLOS is we're ever inflating expectations. When you have this error budget, take risks. Make sure you remind people that systems can fail and your systems will fail. By making these things explicit, you can make these things real.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                So eliminated waste drives better outcomes. The second is that implicit expectations exist. Slos are not only for the googles of the world, they're for everyone. Make sure you're building products that are fit for purpose.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
