    <meta property="og:description" content="Users expect immersive experiences that can not only be entertaining but create engagement and retention.  This workshop will explore some of the theory around user perception while learning the BabylonJS library for creating 3D environments in a web browser.  Additional hands-on sections explore extending this environment to include live streaming media and communications between participants in that metaverse environment. For real-time interactivity with sub-second latency we'll cover some of the same techniques with WebRTC being used by major companies for broadcast quality workflows."/>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Griffin Zahal at Kale is excited to talk to all of you about building a browser based metaverse with Babylonjs. We're going to take a look at 3d environment and game development all within javascript.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Babylonjs is a JavaScript based library for 3d graphics rendering. Traditionally this is in the game development space, but it isn't limited to game developments at all. Uses in education, blockchain, data visualization and others among the game production areas.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Playground Babylon Js is an NPM package that allows you to create 3d environments directly in the browser. It's very dynamic on how you're going to be able to make it happen. We can use camera attached control to let us move the camera dynamically.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Next we have the lights. And lights are very important because without lights, you won't be able to see anything. The sphere itself has some subparameters that we're going to be putting directly into it. Babylonjs does have pre built objects that you might want to build directly in.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Babylon playground lets you create scenes directly from 3d assets and concepts. You can even switch scenes directly within the environment that you have. This also includes areas like VR and AR experiences.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Babylonjs is a tool that allows you to create your own virtual reality experiences. It has built in support for VR headsets where you can try out a lot of these different playground examples on your Google cardboard device.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Using render loops to modify models so that they are updating live without needing to keep on rerendering your scene over and over again manually. Using videos as textures where yes, videos can be pre recorded, but still allows you to take an actual 3d environment and then overlay video directly on it.

                Dolby IO live streaming allows you to be able to stream live content in extremely low latency. It enables real time broadcasting directly in metaverses, which we've seen a lot of very good use cases for. Once again, using an HTML five interface as long as it's accepted in your web browser.

                You also have the ability to add in spatial audio via Dolby as well. There are a lot of web based ways that you're able to do live communications between different people.
