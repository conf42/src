    <meta property="og:description" content="Over the years a lot of research has been conducted and many books have been written on how to improve the resilience of our software. This talk will dive deep into the three keep practices identified by the authors of Accelerate to improve reliability: Chaos Engineering, GameDays, and Disaster Recovery. We will discuss the key measures of tempo and stability, and how practicing Chaos Engineering will increase both.   We will be walking through the Google Cloud open source Bank of Anthos application to illustrate why teams should focus on the customer experience and how to test for failures.   Attendees will learn practical tips that you can put into action focused on resource consumption, capacity planning, region failover, decoupling services and deployment pain. "/>

<!-- Text -->
<p>Over the years a lot of research has been conducted and many books have been written on how to improve the resilience of our software. This talk will dive deep into the three keep practices identified by the authors of Accelerate to improve reliability: Chaos Engineering, GameDays, and Disaster Recovery. We will discuss the key measures of tempo and stability, and how practicing Chaos Engineering will increase both. </p>
<p>We will be walking through the Google Cloud open source Bank of Anthos application to illustrate why teams should focus on the customer experience and how to test for failures. </p>
<p>Attendees will learn practical tips that you can put into action focused on resource consumption, capacity planning, region failover, decoupling services and deployment pain.</p>

              Summary
            </h3>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                Julie Gunderson: How can you make your systems more reliable and improve the reliability of everything? She says two key practices that improve the key measures of tempo and stability are chaos engineering and game days. At the end of this, she will let you know how you can get a free chaos engineering certification.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Tempo is measured by deployment frequency and change lead time. And stability is measures by mean time to recover MTTR and change failure rate. These are the types of metrics that accelerate recommends that you measure.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                According to Accelerate, you should focus on improving reliability. It's the foundation that enables you to have a really great tempo. Engineers feel more confident when software is reliable. That makes you actually able to ship code faster and more reliably.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Chaos engineering is about simulating the chaos of the real world in a controlled environment. You start with a hypothesis and experiment to validate that hypothesis. Communication is important, so you want to make sure you share your plans with everyone. Sharing what you learn makes everyone better engineers.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                To measure how systems change during an experiment, it's important to understand how they behave now. This involves collecting relevant metrics from target systems under normal load. Through these experiments, you're planning about your systems and validating your hypothesis. Share the results of your chaos engineering experiments with your teams.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                You can use any chaos engineering tool. Start small in staging, then expand your blast radius and move to production. Ask yourself, does black holing a critical path service result in a graceful degradation of the customer experience?

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Kubectl scale deployment transaction history and give it two replicas instead of just one. Send 50% of the transaction history pods into a black hole. Will things be okay? Will things get worse? You never really know until you run the experiment.

              </li>
              
              <li>
                Game days are a great way to build relationships within an organization. The goal is cooperative, proactive testing of our system to enhance reliability. Plan for a minimum of 30 minutes though, in the real world. Document the results and then share widely in the organization.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
