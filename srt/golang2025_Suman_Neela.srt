1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,020
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,250
My name is Simon.

3
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,500
Welcome to conference 42, goal line 2025.

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,910
Today we'll be discussing about the
topic transforming payer operations

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,585
with realtime data integration.

6
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:13,305
How.

7
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:20,285
Healthcare payer landscape is undergoing
the performed transformation and how

8
00:00:20,285 --> 00:00:25,295
that can be used to transform payer
operations with realtime data integration.

9
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:29,825
So in today's world, the healthcare
payer landscape is undergoing a

10
00:00:29,825 --> 00:00:33,960
performed transformation through the
integration of real time data processing.

11
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,660
And middleware solutions.

12
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:39,980
So these solutions are dramatically
improving the claims processing,

13
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:45,529
eligibility verification, and statistics,
while ensuring the regulatory complaints.

14
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:49,279
So organizations which are
implementing these technologies

15
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,019
have seen remarkable results.

16
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:59,809
Like example, 40% faster claim processing,
60% fewer denials and reduction in

17
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,649
integration development time with, 50%.

18
00:01:03,175 --> 00:01:05,004
And also the data accuracy.

19
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:08,664
Maintaining the data accuracy
in today's world is a big

20
00:01:08,664 --> 00:01:10,945
challenge for every industry.

21
00:01:11,244 --> 00:01:17,755
So 99.9% data accuracy can be
achieved using this transformation.

22
00:01:18,205 --> 00:01:23,395
Advanced solutions like cloud-based
message brokers can process over 10,000

23
00:01:23,395 --> 00:01:28,660
messages per second, enabling faster claim
resolution and improved fraud deduction.

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,760
So let's get into the
challenges of payer operations.

25
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,680
Current challenges in payer operations,
like one is manual processing bottlenecks.

26
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,300
Traditional claim processing relies
on manual intervention, creating

27
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,990
bottlenecks that slow down the
operation and increase administrative

28
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:51,930
cost, which is like studies shows that
manual crime processing can take up

29
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,230
to 30 days to complete the processing.

30
00:01:55,955 --> 00:02:01,024
and the second challenge, what we
have today is data S and fragmentation

31
00:02:01,445 --> 00:02:05,374
healthcare data exist in disparate
systems, making it difficult to

32
00:02:05,374 --> 00:02:07,774
access complete page and information.

33
00:02:08,255 --> 00:02:13,265
This fragmentation leads to eligibility
errors and delayed claim resolutions.

34
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:19,345
And the third challenge that what we
see is regulatory compliance burden.

35
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:22,465
So payers face increasingly complex.

36
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:27,910
Compliance requirements like
hipaa, a CA, and interoperability

37
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,940
mandates without integrated systems.

38
00:02:31,149 --> 00:02:35,709
Maintaining the compliance becomes
resource intensity and error problem.

39
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:41,569
So these are the challenges like, current
payer industries, healthcare industry,

40
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,569
and bay operations are undergoing.

41
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:47,389
So let's get into your topic.

42
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,140
Like what is the power of
realtime data integration?

43
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:57,460
How can it bring down or bring value
to the processing claims processing

44
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,490
like 40% of faster claims processing
can be achieved using realtime data

45
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:07,110
integration, accelerate claim processing,
and reducing resolution times and

46
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,480
improving your payer efficiency.

47
00:03:10,179 --> 00:03:10,989
and also.

48
00:03:11,749 --> 00:03:17,329
reduce claim denials, so which reduces
60% claim denials using the enhanced

49
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:19,879
data security and realtime verification.

50
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,419
Significantly decrease the costly claim,
rejections and rework, and it also

51
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:29,899
increases 50% integration efficiency.

52
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:33,679
Middleware solutions like Del
Boomi cut the development time in

53
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:36,199
half, which is 50% as we discussed.

54
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:39,109
Speeding implementation
and return of investment.

55
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:45,664
And the last but not least, it's very
important, which is data integrity.

56
00:03:46,234 --> 00:03:52,264
99.9% data integrity can be achieved
using modern integration platform.

57
00:03:52,564 --> 00:03:56,194
Ensure near perfect data
accuracy, minimizing the

58
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,629
error and comprehensive risk.

59
00:03:58,444 --> 00:04:01,464
So these are the, things
that we can achieve using the

60
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:03,204
real time data integration.

61
00:04:03,474 --> 00:04:06,624
This is the power of, real time data
integration in the middleware sector.

62
00:04:07,404 --> 00:04:12,174
So when it comes to how it can be
a backbone of modern payer system,

63
00:04:12,894 --> 00:04:16,554
so today business applications
like claim processing engines,

64
00:04:16,794 --> 00:04:18,804
eligibility verification system.

65
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:22,314
And interactive member quotas.

66
00:04:22,704 --> 00:04:27,924
And when it comes to a p, a management
layer, so second, restful a PA

67
00:04:27,924 --> 00:04:33,284
services, secure restful services,
which can be achieved using and

68
00:04:33,284 --> 00:04:35,084
comprehensive, a PA governance.

69
00:04:35,564 --> 00:04:39,074
And the third one is like
middleware integration layer,

70
00:04:39,284 --> 00:04:43,634
real time data transformation,
intelligent message routing, complex

71
00:04:43,634 --> 00:04:45,884
data, workflow orchestration.

72
00:04:46,384 --> 00:04:50,584
So this is going to be a pivotal role
that is going to play in the middle

73
00:04:51,215 --> 00:04:55,414
middleware integration layer and
data storage and processing, right?

74
00:04:55,775 --> 00:05:01,084
So distributed databases, cloud-based
data warehouses and predictive

75
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:06,724
analysis and engines, infrastructure
that is going to be elastic cloud

76
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:11,164
resources, legacy on-premises system,
and scalable hybrid architecture.

77
00:05:11,989 --> 00:05:15,949
All these things combined can be
a backbone of modern payer system.

78
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:21,889
Enterprise middleware system
solution function as a critical and

79
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:26,359
connectivity issue between connectivity
issue between the heterogeneous

80
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,219
systems in the healthcare ecosystem.

81
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:34,219
These integrations right platforms
enable seamless bidirectional and

82
00:05:34,309 --> 00:05:37,489
data flow while enforcing the robust.

83
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:41,809
Security protocol and regulatory
compliance requirements.

84
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:48,349
So this all, not only doing the seamless
bidirectional data flow, but also,

85
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:53,129
protects the security protocol, regulatory
compliance requirements, which is very

86
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:57,504
important for the payer industry by
creating a unified architecture, a

87
00:05:57,504 --> 00:06:03,054
middleware, bridges legacy systems with
a cutting edge applications providing

88
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:05,155
the technical foundation necessary.

89
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:09,490
For realtime healthcare
operating and, innovations.

90
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,130
And, when it comes to revolutionizing
the claim processing, this is a very

91
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,980
good concept that, I want to bring.

92
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,090
So how the claims processing can be
happened while from the submission

93
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,010
to the status communication.

94
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,450
So one is like submission status
when the claims are submitted

95
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,410
electronically, immediately
validated against the member data.

96
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,010
And also provider contracts.

97
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,260
How the provider's
contracts are established.

98
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,940
Real time data integration allows
the instant format verification

99
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:44,470
and initial error detection format
Verification is very important in the

100
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:49,320
payer industry, so they maintain the
different formats for each sector.

101
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,890
So like that, so payer
industry has its own format.

102
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,630
That format verification is very
important, which is going to.

103
00:06:58,275 --> 00:07:02,055
have the initial error detection
also, and adjudication, right?

104
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:05,445
When you, when it comes to the
second part is adjudication.

105
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:10,575
Middleware ate the complex adjudication
process, applying business rules,

106
00:07:10,575 --> 00:07:15,165
benefit calculations, provider
contract terms in real time, reducing

107
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:20,435
the paper, reducing the processing
time in from days to minutes.

108
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,225
and the third payment determination.

109
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:28,475
Integrated system calculate accurate
payment amounts based on the

110
00:07:28,475 --> 00:07:33,425
realtime contract and benefit data
drastically, dramatically reducing the

111
00:07:33,425 --> 00:07:36,215
overpayments and underpayments status.

112
00:07:36,215 --> 00:07:41,135
Communication, providing the
provide, providing the members and

113
00:07:41,135 --> 00:07:43,585
providers, in, with the status.

114
00:07:43,585 --> 00:07:45,505
Communication is going to help a lot.

115
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,510
Like providers and members receive
instant status updates through the

116
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:54,130
integrated protocols and messaging
systems, improving satisfaction and

117
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:58,260
reducing the inquiry volume, real
time eligibility verification, which

118
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:03,330
is very important and very useful
for all the members and providers.

119
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,470
Member data access, seamless
verification of coverage status, whether

120
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,000
the particular member is eligible.

121
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,190
Can be done instantaneously.

122
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,180
Benefit validation.

123
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,260
Immediate service authorization,
provider confirmation.

124
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,730
Instantaneous results.

125
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,300
Delivery.

126
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:24,390
Financial responsibility, precise cost
Sharing determination that can happen.

127
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,265
Using this real time
eligibility verification.

128
00:08:27,765 --> 00:08:32,265
Revolutionizes both provider workflow
and the member experiences by eliminating

129
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:37,335
uncertainty, reducing administrative
burden, and preventing the delays.

130
00:08:37,835 --> 00:08:41,914
When integrated directly with the
practice management system, it enables

131
00:08:41,945 --> 00:08:46,535
instant benefit verification during
the appointment scheduling at the point

132
00:08:46,535 --> 00:08:52,025
of service sustainability, reducing
the climate, and also optimizing the

133
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:54,965
entire revenue cycle management process.

134
00:08:55,475 --> 00:09:00,695
So it is going to help in all
aspects like service eligibility,

135
00:09:00,695 --> 00:09:03,635
revenue management process.

136
00:09:03,734 --> 00:09:07,334
And also state of the art
verification system, process

137
00:09:07,334 --> 00:09:11,234
eligibility request in millisecond
instead of the minutes or hours.

138
00:09:11,744 --> 00:09:17,384
So seamlessly handling the event,
even most of the volume, extreme

139
00:09:17,384 --> 00:09:20,054
volumes are going to happen
during the open enrollment.

140
00:09:20,564 --> 00:09:25,994
So at that point of time, also, the system
will not be degraded and in the perform

141
00:09:25,994 --> 00:09:28,334
in the aspect of performance or accuracy.

142
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:32,495
When it comes to event driven
architecture for claim statistics,

143
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:36,965
so checking a claim status is a
very important aspect of, real time.

144
00:09:37,415 --> 00:09:40,325
This thing, real time
publishing and notification.

145
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:44,765
When a claim status changes, the
system instantaneously publish an

146
00:09:44,795 --> 00:09:49,775
event that triggers notification
and updates across all the connected

147
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:55,110
systems, reducing the eligibility check
processing time from 1.5 hours to.

148
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,305
Just 0.3 seconds.

149
00:09:58,085 --> 00:10:02,915
Similarly, message brokers and scaling
advanced message broker process over

150
00:10:02,915 --> 00:10:07,325
10,000 messages per second during the
peak periods will help maintaining

151
00:10:07,325 --> 00:10:11,975
the system responsiveness and data
integrity, handling the claim status

152
00:10:12,035 --> 00:10:17,855
updates in just 0.5 seconds versus
three to four hours traditionally

153
00:10:18,355 --> 00:10:19,660
prior authorization efficiency.

154
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:24,790
Event driven systems reduce
preauthorization process time generally

155
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,329
takes 48 hours from to just five seconds.

156
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:32,680
Enabling immediate clinical decision
and which supports dramatically

157
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:38,140
improving provider workflow as well
as member it, it helps members to get

158
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:43,140
the immediate clinical decision and
also accelerated claims adjudication.

159
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,860
The complete claim adjudication
process is transformed from a.

160
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,725
72 hour way to just 30 seconds.

161
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:53,865
Maintaining the data integrity while
enabling the realtime updates for all

162
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:58,575
stakeholders is not easy thing that
can be achieved using the event driven

163
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,455
architecture claim status, checks.

164
00:11:02,235 --> 00:11:05,775
So finally, event driven
architecture enables realtime.

165
00:11:06,195 --> 00:11:10,035
Claim statistics tracking through a
system of publishers, subscribers,

166
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:15,285
and message broker dramatically
reducing the lag between the status

167
00:11:15,285 --> 00:11:17,595
change and stakeholder notification.

168
00:11:18,225 --> 00:11:24,945
So cloud-based message brokers enabling
scalability, so scalability, security

169
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:29,595
integration, seamless integration
are the wonderful features that can

170
00:11:29,595 --> 00:11:31,580
be, achieved using this concept.

171
00:11:32,455 --> 00:11:36,445
So cloud-based message brokers
automatically scale to handle

172
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:39,085
very transaction volumes.

173
00:11:39,235 --> 00:11:44,575
So from routine daily processing to
month end surges, this eliminates

174
00:11:44,575 --> 00:11:48,115
the need for over provisioning
on-premises infrastructure,

175
00:11:48,615 --> 00:11:52,755
while ensuring the consistent
performance as well and security.

176
00:11:52,905 --> 00:11:54,285
So enhanced security.

177
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:58,665
Modern cloud brokers implement
advanced encryption, access

178
00:11:58,665 --> 00:12:00,435
control compliance features.

179
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,480
That meet or exceed HIPA requirement.

180
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,530
This feature protects sensitive
patient data through the messaging

181
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:10,230
process from origin to the destination.

182
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,000
So security is a matter.

183
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,440
So seamless integration, prebuilt
connectors, and standardized APAs

184
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:21,030
enable rapid integration with both
legacy systems and modern application.

185
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,560
This reduces implementation
from months to weeks.

186
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,405
Which is very important.

187
00:12:27,975 --> 00:12:32,385
Drastic red use of the time processing
from months to week while maintaining

188
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:35,175
the data integrity across the platform.

189
00:12:35,675 --> 00:12:36,275
Okay.

190
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:37,415
AI and machine learning.

191
00:12:37,415 --> 00:12:43,455
The next front are how a and machine
learning can be useful, using this

192
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:48,555
middleware technologies, real time data
so we can predict the claim processing.

193
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:54,330
Our AI algorithms analyze the historical
claims data, predict outcomes, identify

194
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,610
potential issues before they occur,
and suggest optimal processing path.

195
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,430
How, which way, which
path that it has to take?

196
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:08,460
This proactive approach reduces the
manual view requirements up to by 30%.

197
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,080
So we are going to, with the predictive
claim processing, the manual effort

198
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,450
is going to be reduced by 35%,
30% intelligent fraud detection.

199
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:23,000
Machine learning models continuously
analyzes the claims patent

200
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,840
to identify the anomalies and
potential fraud in real time.

201
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,980
So machine learning can eliminate the
frauds in the real time scenarios.

202
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,730
This system can detect the
sophisticated fraud schemes that

203
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,220
could in be invisible to system.

204
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,400
We can avoid the fraud detect,
fraud transactions, fraud claims.

205
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:46,830
And when it comes to natural language
processing, NLP extracts meaningful

206
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:52,320
data from unstructured clinical
notes and documentation, enhancing

207
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,060
the claim adjudication process with
relevant clinical content that would

208
00:13:57,065 --> 00:13:59,040
otherwise require a manual review.

209
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,980
So here also, it is going
to save the manual time.

210
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,320
And autonomous resolution.

211
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:09,960
Advanced AI systems can autonomously
resolve routine claim issues without

212
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:15,150
human intervention, allowing staff to
focus on the complex cases that require

213
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,300
clinical expertise and also advertisement.

214
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,100
So edge computing.

215
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,140
So the most training technology,
which is the edge computing

216
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,760
processing at the point of care.

217
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,680
So distributed processing reduces
the bandwidth requirements.

218
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,280
Continuous operation, real
time clinical integration.

219
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,020
So how edge computing is going to help us.

220
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:44,990
So dis distributed processing edge
computing moves data processing closer

221
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:49,880
to the source of data generation,
such as a hospital's clinics.

222
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,860
The distributed approach reduces the
latency by processing the eligibility

223
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:00,170
at simple eligibility and simple claims
directly at the healthcare facility.

224
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:05,960
Before even submission, or transforming
to the transmission, to the central

225
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:11,630
systems so we don't have to process
the data to the transmission, to the

226
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:17,330
central system to identify whether this
particular processing is really required.

227
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,760
The central system.

228
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,560
So this distributed processing can
take care of that at the source

229
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,770
level itself by saving so much.

230
00:15:27,295 --> 00:15:31,705
Time and processing,
eligibility and latency also.

231
00:15:31,915 --> 00:15:33,715
So reduced bandwidth requirement.

232
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:39,605
So it is going to save the, bandwidth,
which is in process, like by processing

233
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,795
the filtering and locally data.

234
00:15:41,795 --> 00:15:46,145
Locally it's competing, reduces the
amount of information that must be

235
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,155
transmitted to the central system.

236
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:54,275
These particularly valuables for
rural and are undeserved areas.

237
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:57,260
So where the limited
connectivity is there.

238
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,030
There, the reduced bandwidth
requirement is going to help a lot.

239
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,310
Continuous Operation Edge systems can
continue to function during the network.

240
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:10,990
Outages are central system maintenance,
storing the transactions locally

241
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,180
until the connectivity is stored.

242
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:19,690
This ensures that patient care continues
uninterrupted, even though even

243
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,490
during the technical disruptions also.

244
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:27,250
Real time clinical integration edge
processing enables real time integration

245
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:32,200
between clinical system and payer system,
supporting value based care models

246
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:38,230
that require immediate feedback on care
decision and their financial implications.

247
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:43,805
So let's see how the roadmap
looks like, for a future outlook.

248
00:16:44,435 --> 00:16:46,740
Short term actions like
zero to six months.

249
00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:52,805
Access to current integration
architecture and identify local gaps.

250
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:57,844
Implement middleware connectors
for high volume transactions.

251
00:16:58,265 --> 00:17:02,854
Deploy cloud-based message brokers
for eligibility verification.

252
00:17:03,485 --> 00:17:07,744
So train the staff on new real
time capabilities and workflows.

253
00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:12,034
So this is the short term goal,
like from zero to six months how

254
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:13,885
we can access the integration.

255
00:17:14,305 --> 00:17:19,205
Architecture and, critical gaps
and how we can, use the middleware

256
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,425
connector for high volume transactions.

257
00:17:21,905 --> 00:17:26,855
How can we deploy the cloud-based message
brokers for eligibility verification?

258
00:17:26,855 --> 00:17:33,485
So whether the person is eligible at or
not instantaneously get the eligibility

259
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:38,245
verification when it comes to medium
term goals, which is six to 18 months.

260
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:43,330
Transition to fully event driven
architecture from claim processing.

261
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,740
Implement AI assisted claims
adjudication for routine claims.

262
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:53,260
Develop, provide provider facing
APAs for direct system integrations.

263
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,395
So provider facing integrations
are going to be very helpful and

264
00:17:57,435 --> 00:18:01,520
implementing the AI assisted claim
Education also at the facility is

265
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,560
going to be very helpful and it's going
to give the instantaneous decisions.

266
00:18:07,115 --> 00:18:12,485
And establish the edge computing pilots
at major provider partners, which

267
00:18:12,485 --> 00:18:17,765
is going to save, longer, processing
time for instantaneous decisions.

268
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:24,215
So long term vision, 18 placements achieve
near instantaneous claim processing.

269
00:18:24,215 --> 00:18:29,790
For standard claims, instantaneous
claim processing can be achieved.

270
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:35,420
In the long term vision, implement
predictive analytics for proactive

271
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,370
intervention, and this can be
achieved using the edge computing

272
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:44,075
implementation of predictive analysis
for proactive intervention, deploy

273
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,710
auto autonomous exception handling for
common issues, transition to blockchain

274
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,900
for select high value transactions.

275
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,785
So these are the long-term visions
that what we are going to achieve.

276
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:03,275
Using the payer transformation healthcare,
using the realtime data integration.

277
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:04,195
Thank you.

278
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:05,635
Thanks, Sue.

279
00:19:05,725 --> 00:19:06,385
Thank you for your.
