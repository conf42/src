1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,310
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,670
My name is Shaka and I am a
supply chain professional.

3
00:00:04,729 --> 00:00:09,110
I currently work at Meta Platforms as a
supply chain solutions program manager.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,870
Today we are going to dive deep
into a topic that is at the

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,830
forefront of modern logistics,
transforming supply chain performance

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,569
through digital twin technology.

7
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:24,330
This isn't just about buzzwords, it's
about creating a virtual real time replica

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,340
of our entire physical supply chain.

9
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:31,154
This digital twin allows us to
stimulate, predict, and optimize

10
00:00:31,185 --> 00:00:35,474
every aspect of our operations
with incredible accuracy and speed.

11
00:00:36,224 --> 00:00:39,524
To achieve this, our approach
is built on two key pillars.

12
00:00:39,825 --> 00:00:45,165
First, we'll explore advanced route
optimization, which goes far beyond simple

13
00:00:45,165 --> 00:00:49,960
GPS, adapting in real time to traffic,
weather, and other unforeseen events.

14
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,700
And second, we'll discuss the power
of a rust powered infrastructure.

15
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:59,200
A choice we made for its superior
performance, security, and reliability,

16
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,820
which is essential for handling the
immense data generated by a digital twin.

17
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,620
Our ultimate goal is to present
a comprehensive cutting edge

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,300
strategy for truly revolutionizing
global supply chain networks.

19
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,255
Okay, great.

20
00:01:15,615 --> 00:01:17,414
Let's walk through our roadmap for today.

21
00:01:17,684 --> 00:01:20,414
Our agenda is designed to
guide you through a complex

22
00:01:20,474 --> 00:01:22,004
digital transformation journey.

23
00:01:22,454 --> 00:01:24,914
We'll start with the fundamentals
and build up to practical

24
00:01:24,914 --> 00:01:26,174
real world application.

25
00:01:26,354 --> 00:01:30,374
First, we'll lay the groundwork by
exploring the digital twin foundations.

26
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:35,324
We'll define exactly what this technology
is, how it functions, and why it's

27
00:01:35,324 --> 00:01:40,124
becoming the cornerstone for every
supply chain management and delivering

28
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:41,714
unprecedented operational improvements.

29
00:01:42,214 --> 00:01:45,725
And next, we'll dive into
key components of the system,

30
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:47,975
variance based route optimization.

31
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:51,440
This is a critical departure
from traditional methods.

32
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:56,419
Instead of just optimizing for the fastest
route, we'll look at strategies that

33
00:01:56,419 --> 00:01:59,149
prioritize predictability and consistency.

34
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,009
This approach dramatically improves
shipment tracking accuracy and reduces

35
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:08,375
the frustrating surprises that come
with unpredictable transit times.

36
00:02:08,874 --> 00:02:12,869
Then we'll talk about the underlying
engine that makes all of this possible

37
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,879
a rust powered infrastructure.

38
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:18,464
And I'll explain why we choose this
specific language for its memory,

39
00:02:18,464 --> 00:02:22,515
safety, and speed, which allows our
system to process massive volumes

40
00:02:22,515 --> 00:02:27,444
of high velocity data with micro
speed precision a non-negotiable

41
00:02:27,444 --> 00:02:29,484
requirement for real time digital twins.

42
00:02:29,904 --> 00:02:34,254
And finally, we'll bring it all together
with a look at implementation and ROI.

43
00:02:34,584 --> 00:02:35,874
This is where we get practical.

44
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:40,014
We'll cover the data integration
requirements, the importance of change

45
00:02:40,014 --> 00:02:41,724
management, and most importantly.

46
00:02:42,114 --> 00:02:45,024
We'll show you how to measure
a substantial and documented

47
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:46,284
return on your investment.

48
00:02:46,764 --> 00:02:50,514
And by the end of this session, you'll
have a clear understanding of not just

49
00:02:50,514 --> 00:02:55,104
the technology, but how also leading
organizations are using this to achieve

50
00:02:55,404 --> 00:02:59,454
transformative results with real world
case studies and documented metrics.

51
00:02:59,954 --> 00:03:00,444
Alright?

52
00:03:00,444 --> 00:03:00,829
All right.

53
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:04,719
Now let's talk about how this
technology is fundamentally changing

54
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,129
the way we manage our operations.

55
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:10,164
Yes, we are moving beyond the traditional
supply chain control tower, which

56
00:03:10,194 --> 00:03:14,544
often just provides a dashboard of
historical data and into a new era

57
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:16,374
powered by digital twin technology.

58
00:03:17,034 --> 00:03:22,044
Think of a digital twin as living,
breathing, virtual replica of

59
00:03:22,044 --> 00:03:23,784
your entire physical supply chain.

60
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,704
It's not just a static model.

61
00:03:26,214 --> 00:03:31,314
It's a dynamic, real-time representation
that enables unprecedented visibility and

62
00:03:31,314 --> 00:03:33,804
control and the results for organizing.

63
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,974
Organizations implementing this
are tangible and measurable.

64
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:43,524
First, let's look at time to market
reduction by building a digital twin,

65
00:03:43,674 --> 00:03:48,294
companies can now stimulate new product
launches and test different supply

66
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:52,014
chain configurations in a virtual
environment before ever committing

67
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:53,454
to a physical implementation.

68
00:03:54,144 --> 00:03:58,764
This allows them to identify and resolve
bottlenecks in a matter of hours, not

69
00:03:58,764 --> 00:04:01,044
months leading to product launches.

70
00:04:01,404 --> 00:04:04,644
That are an incredible 30 to 45% faster.

71
00:04:05,184 --> 00:04:10,464
This leads directly to significant design
and development savings by identifying

72
00:04:10,464 --> 00:04:15,774
and mitigating supply chain constraints
virtually things like capacity limitations

73
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:17,904
or sourcing risks we can avoid.

74
00:04:17,964 --> 00:04:22,604
Costly physical companies are also
seeing average cost reductions of about

75
00:04:22,814 --> 00:04:24,644
two to five millions on new product.

76
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:28,964
In introductions alone, it's like having
a crystal ball for your supply chain.

77
00:04:29,685 --> 00:04:33,315
And finally, the impact on
operational efficiency is profound.

78
00:04:33,585 --> 00:04:38,895
The digital twin powered by AI allows for
continuous automated scenario planning.

79
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:44,145
It can dynamically reallocate resources,
optimize transportation lanes, and

80
00:04:44,145 --> 00:04:49,635
adjust inventory levels in real time,
resulting in a 15 to 25% improvement

81
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:51,945
in overall resource utilization.

82
00:04:52,515 --> 00:04:54,554
Ultimately, this is a paradigm shift.

83
00:04:54,734 --> 00:04:56,685
We are moving away from
the reactive model.

84
00:04:57,044 --> 00:05:02,174
Where we spend our time putting out fires
to predictive one, where real time digital

85
00:05:02,174 --> 00:05:07,304
replicas enable continuous optimization
and automated exception handling

86
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:10,004
often before an issue even arises.

87
00:05:10,504 --> 00:05:13,804
Okay, let's move from a
theory to concrete example.

88
00:05:14,134 --> 00:05:18,424
This case study focuses on a real
world problem optimizing global

89
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,244
maritime shipping routes for years.

90
00:05:21,694 --> 00:05:27,184
Traditional route optimization focused on
just two things, finding the fastest path

91
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:32,254
or the cheapest path, but our work with
leading global shippers shows that this

92
00:05:32,284 --> 00:05:34,655
isn't the whole story we have discovered.

93
00:05:34,924 --> 00:05:41,794
What truly delivers superior outcomes is
variance based route optimization, which

94
00:05:41,794 --> 00:05:45,064
prioritize consistency over sheer speed.

95
00:05:45,564 --> 00:05:48,655
This means we're not just looking
for the route that gets there

96
00:05:48,744 --> 00:05:49,914
in the least amount of time.

97
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:55,119
But the route that gets there in the most
predictable amount of time every single

98
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:57,069
time, and the results are powerful.

99
00:05:57,429 --> 00:06:02,859
First, this approach improved
shipment tracking accuracy by 37%.

100
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:06,789
When you can really predict when a
shipment will arrive, your tracking

101
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:08,469
data becomes far more accurate.

102
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:13,419
This predictability enables precise
inventory planning, and crucially

103
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:18,459
allows you to significantly reduce the
need for an expensive safety stock.

104
00:06:19,195 --> 00:06:23,455
Our advanced algorithms were able
to identify entire shipping lanes

105
00:06:23,455 --> 00:06:28,314
with a 42% lower transit variance,
even when their average transit

106
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:30,174
times were similar to other routes.

107
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:34,184
This means we found routes that
were simply more reliable and the

108
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:36,014
financial impact is substantial.

109
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:41,204
A Fortune 500 manufacturer was able
to achieve about 3.2 million in

110
00:06:41,264 --> 00:06:46,124
annual savings simply by being able
to reduce it safe safety stock levels.

111
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:50,039
A direct result of more predictable
and consistent deliveries.

112
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:54,359
This level of optimization is only
possible with sophisticated digital twin

113
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:58,499
models that can simulate thousands of
route permutations while accounting for

114
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:02,859
a historical variance not just average
transit times, it's a game changer for

115
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:04,239
building resilience and inefficiency.

116
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:06,359
All right, moving on.

117
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,849
Let's talk about the key
capabilities of Rust.

118
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:11,339
First, let's look at Rust Score strength.

119
00:07:11,804 --> 00:07:15,914
Starting with a memory safety, a
major source of bugs in software

120
00:07:15,914 --> 00:07:17,924
comes from how it manages memory.

121
00:07:18,914 --> 00:07:24,704
Rusts unique ownership model virtually
eliminates these bugs for supply chain

122
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:29,924
monitoring applications, which are often
left for run for months or even years.

123
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:30,974
This is a huge deal.

124
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:35,474
We can avoid the kind of gradual memory
leaks that cause systems to slow down

125
00:07:35,474 --> 00:07:39,854
or crash, ensuring our applications
are cons, consistently reliable.

126
00:07:40,354 --> 00:07:42,304
Next we have zero cost abstractions.

127
00:07:42,844 --> 00:07:45,814
This is one of rusts
most impressive features.

128
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:50,074
It means we can write code that is
clean and high level, easy to read

129
00:07:50,074 --> 00:07:54,424
and manage, but compli, but compiles
down to the same level of performance

130
00:07:54,424 --> 00:07:56,464
as a low level language like C.

131
00:07:57,124 --> 00:08:01,539
This lets us execute complex algorithms
with minimum overhead, which is

132
00:08:01,544 --> 00:08:05,624
essential when you're trying to optimize
logistics and route planning on the fly.

133
00:08:06,284 --> 00:08:06,614
Third.

134
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,179
Rust offers fearless concurrency.

135
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,639
The modern supply chain is a whirlwind
of data, especially from iot sensors.

136
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:18,539
We're talking about high velocity data
streams from thousands of touch points.

137
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:22,589
Rust makes this possible to
write multi-threaded code that

138
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:24,719
is completely free of data races.

139
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:28,799
This is a game changer for processing
massive amounts of data concurrently,

140
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:32,519
allowing us to keep up with the pace
of real time global supply chain.

141
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:35,519
And finally, the cross
platform development.

142
00:08:35,534 --> 00:08:37,604
And this is about versatility.

143
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:42,074
Rust can compile to web assembly,
which means a rust powered analytics

144
00:08:42,344 --> 00:08:46,064
and applications can run efficiently
on everything from tiny, low

145
00:08:46,064 --> 00:08:50,174
powered, embedded shipping sensors
to powerful cloud data centers.

146
00:08:50,744 --> 00:08:54,704
This allows us to have a consistent
and efficient code base across the

147
00:08:54,704 --> 00:08:59,084
entire infrastructure from the smallest
decide device to a largest server.

148
00:08:59,584 --> 00:09:02,224
So what does this all
mean for the organization?

149
00:09:02,854 --> 00:09:06,574
These capabilities make rust
uniquely suited for supply chain

150
00:09:06,574 --> 00:09:10,564
applications that demand both
extreme reliability and performance.

151
00:09:10,954 --> 00:09:14,644
While Python is fantastic and
popular language for data science

152
00:09:14,644 --> 00:09:19,564
and prototyping, organizations are
increasingly MA making a strategic shift.

153
00:09:19,714 --> 00:09:23,554
They're moving to a hybrid architecture
where Python is used for initial data

154
00:09:23,554 --> 00:09:28,984
analysis, but final mission critical
production services where failure simply

155
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:30,874
isn't an option, are built in rust.

156
00:09:31,374 --> 00:09:36,014
Okay, now let's get a bit more technical
and look at how rusts architecture

157
00:09:36,014 --> 00:09:38,024
directly benefits the organization.

158
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:42,574
Rusts ownership model is powered
is a powerful concept for 24 by

159
00:09:42,574 --> 00:09:44,374
seven supply chain operations.

160
00:09:44,704 --> 00:09:49,354
It eliminates memory leaks by
managing the lifespan of data.

161
00:09:49,954 --> 00:09:51,214
Let's look at a simple example.

162
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,959
Imagine a function that processes
data from a container in the code.

163
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,774
When the process container data
function is called, it takes

164
00:09:58,774 --> 00:10:00,604
ownership of the container object.

165
00:10:01,114 --> 00:10:04,804
This means that once the function
is finished, rusts compiler

166
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,924
guarantees that the container
is automatically de allocated.

167
00:10:08,614 --> 00:10:12,964
This prevents a common class of bugs
where memories accidentally used after

168
00:10:12,964 --> 00:10:17,614
it's been freed, which is a major cost
of crashes in a long running system.

169
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:22,194
It's a critical feature for all the
always on monitoring applications.

170
00:10:22,584 --> 00:10:24,234
Next, let's talk about the trade.

171
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:24,774
System.

172
00:10:25,254 --> 00:10:29,334
This feature enables to create a
modular and interchangeable component

173
00:10:29,424 --> 00:10:33,864
for things like route optimization
without any performance cost At runtime.

174
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:38,334
Consider a scenario where we have multiple
ways to optimize a shipping route.

175
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:43,554
We can define a route optimizer, optimizer
trade, which is like a blueprint for what?

176
00:10:43,554 --> 00:10:45,294
A route optimizer we must do.

177
00:10:46,284 --> 00:10:51,234
This rate simply states that any route
optimizer must have an optimized method.

178
00:10:51,504 --> 00:10:54,984
Okay, we can then create different
implementations of the straight,

179
00:10:55,044 --> 00:11:00,924
such as variance based optimizer
and then swap them out as needed.

180
00:11:01,824 --> 00:11:05,064
The key here is that because of
how rust compiles this, there

181
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,464
is no or zero runtime overhead.

182
00:11:08,004 --> 00:11:12,384
The compiler knows exactly which version
of the optimized function to use at

183
00:11:12,384 --> 00:11:17,604
compile time, so we get a flexibility
of a high level object oriented design

184
00:11:17,604 --> 00:11:19,194
without any performance penalty.

185
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:23,549
The end result of this approach is a
new class of systems that can achieve

186
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:28,709
microsecond level precision and maintain
incredible reliability even under the

187
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:31,079
most extreme op operational loads.

188
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:35,789
This is the kind of technological
foundation needed for model modern

189
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:40,619
digital twin implementations and other
next generation supply chain solutions.

190
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:41,359
All right.

191
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:45,004
Okay, now we'll quickly cover
the three core pillars of a

192
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,344
successful digital twin development.

193
00:11:47,704 --> 00:11:49,414
First data integration.

194
00:11:49,864 --> 00:11:52,084
A digital twins power comes from its data.

195
00:11:52,594 --> 00:11:56,974
We need to connect thousands of data
sources from ERP systems to IOT sensors.

196
00:11:57,274 --> 00:12:00,274
Processing over 10,000
data points per second.

197
00:12:00,774 --> 00:12:05,094
Rust synchronous runtime makes this
real time high volume integration

198
00:12:05,094 --> 00:12:08,904
possible, giving us a compile
holistic view of the supply chain.

199
00:12:09,534 --> 00:12:09,984
Second.

200
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:13,404
Algorithm optimization data is useless.

201
00:12:13,404 --> 00:12:14,784
Without smart algorithms.

202
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:19,734
We have seen a 25, 20 7% improvement
in predictive maintenance by

203
00:12:19,734 --> 00:12:21,744
using high performance pipelines.

204
00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:27,114
This is achieved through techniques like
parallel processing and GPU acceleration

205
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:31,434
for complex modeling, which allows
us to act on insights with precision.

206
00:12:31,974 --> 00:12:35,334
Third, change management
technology is only half the battle.

207
00:12:35,574 --> 00:12:38,244
A successful deployment
requires an organization.

208
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,209
Organizational transformation and all
our data shows that focusing on this

209
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:45,489
pillar leads to a 92% success rate.

210
00:12:45,989 --> 00:12:49,709
To achieve this through skills training,
process redesign, starting with the

211
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:53,879
phased implementation to build momentum
and buy-in, and the most successful

212
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:58,289
implementations blend technical excellence
with organizational transformation.

213
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:04,919
By excelling in all these three areas,
one can achieve about 3.2 times greater

214
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:07,349
ROI from the digital twin project.

215
00:13:07,349 --> 00:13:11,819
Yes, start with the small, highly
visible process, high visibility

216
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:15,599
process to demonstrate value and get
the entire organization on board.

217
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:17,679
All right, moving on.

218
00:13:17,979 --> 00:13:21,939
To illustrate the power of digital twins,
let's look at a case study from a leading

219
00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:24,219
global supply global shipping company.

220
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:29,139
The company needed to reduce operational
costs and envi environmental impact.

221
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:34,839
While improving delivery reliability
across this fleet of 1 47 container

222
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:38,739
vessels, their solution was a
digital twin platform powered

223
00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:41,049
by rust based edge computing.

224
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:45,729
This system provided real-time
monitoring of over 1200 parameters

225
00:13:45,969 --> 00:13:50,139
per vessel, enabling, dynamic route
optimization, predictive maintenance,

226
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,269
and AI powered fuel efficiency.

227
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:56,619
This architecture relied on rusts
performance and reliability achieving.

228
00:13:57,084 --> 00:14:01,134
A five millisecond processing time
for critical data and almost a

229
00:14:01,134 --> 00:14:05,184
hundred percent system uptime and
a small eight MB memory footprint.

230
00:14:05,664 --> 00:14:08,844
Critically, its efficient data
compression, reduced satellite

231
00:14:08,844 --> 00:14:11,274
transmission costs by 76 percents.

232
00:14:11,874 --> 00:14:12,744
What were the results?

233
00:14:13,104 --> 00:14:18,174
The implementation led to a significant
measurable improvement, operational

234
00:14:18,174 --> 00:14:23,634
cost reduction, about 18%, fuel
efficiency improvements about 12%.

235
00:14:24,024 --> 00:14:26,724
Reduced maintenance downtime above 32%.

236
00:14:27,414 --> 00:14:31,524
This case study demonstrates that a
well-designed digital twin blending

237
00:14:31,524 --> 00:14:35,814
excellence with a clear business
strategy can lead transformative

238
00:14:35,814 --> 00:14:37,614
results in a demanding environment.

239
00:14:38,114 --> 00:14:42,554
Alright, the digital twin market
in the supply chain is growing

240
00:14:42,554 --> 00:14:47,384
rapidly at A-C-H-E-R of about
37.4%, driven by the need for

241
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:48,944
greater efficiency and resilience.

242
00:14:49,694 --> 00:14:54,224
Organizations that daily implementation
risk falling behind is early adopters

243
00:14:54,224 --> 00:14:56,354
need a powerful compounding advantage.

244
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:59,824
From the data, the most forward
thinking organizations are now

245
00:14:59,824 --> 00:15:04,084
combining digital twins with emerging
technologies to unlock new capabilities.

246
00:15:04,474 --> 00:15:09,724
Quantum computing integration is
leading to a 93% reduction in complex

247
00:15:09,724 --> 00:15:14,224
system calibration time with rust
serving as the foundation of these

248
00:15:14,224 --> 00:15:16,564
hybrid algorithms, machine learning.

249
00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:21,559
Advanced machine learning models
built on rusts ecosystem are achieving

250
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:27,229
about 47% higher reception prediction
accuracy than traditional methods.

251
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:30,469
The early movers are developing
capabilities that were

252
00:15:30,469 --> 00:15:32,449
impossible just 24 months ago.

253
00:15:32,989 --> 00:15:36,739
This integration of digital twins
with these advanced technology

254
00:15:37,549 --> 00:15:41,839
technologies represent the next frontier
in the supply chain optimization.

255
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:43,669
The time to act is now.

256
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:44,559
All right.

257
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:48,759
Let's look at the measurable ROI
of digital twin implementation

258
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,589
highlighting key three areas.

259
00:15:50,859 --> 00:15:52,899
First one is real time optimization.

260
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:58,119
By using real time data and predictive
analytics, we can achieve a 21%

261
00:15:58,119 --> 00:15:59,649
reduction in inventory holding costs.

262
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:04,529
This is a quick win with an implementation
timeframe of four to six months and a

263
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:06,809
payback period of just nine to 12 months.

264
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:09,919
Second one is transportation
and analytics.

265
00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:16,009
The rust implemented dynamic routing
algorithms process over 50,000

266
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:21,589
permutations per second, resulting in a
17% reduction in transportation costs.

267
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,329
The project has a fast payback of six
to eight months for the long term.

268
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:30,619
Advanced analytics deliver about a 42%
improvement in forecast accuracy with

269
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:32,989
the payback of about 10 to 14 months.

270
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:35,089
Third one, the compounding effect.

271
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:37,594
These benefits are not one-time gains.

272
00:16:37,924 --> 00:16:42,424
As the digital twins learn, we see
an additional 70 12% performance

273
00:16:42,424 --> 00:16:44,194
and improvement year over year.

274
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:48,545
The key to maximizing this ROI
is a comprehensive measurement

275
00:16:48,545 --> 00:16:51,334
framework aligned with the
business goals from day one.

276
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:52,285
Alright, all right.

277
00:16:52,974 --> 00:16:57,444
Here's a proven 18 month roadmap for a
successful digital twin implementation.

278
00:16:57,444 --> 00:17:02,154
Broken down into four key phases,
phase number one, months one to three.

279
00:17:02,574 --> 00:17:03,294
The foundation.

280
00:17:04,194 --> 00:17:06,594
This phase is all about
building a solid base.

281
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:09,054
We'll select a technology
stack, including rust.

282
00:17:09,234 --> 00:17:13,824
Define the project scope, identify a pilot
process for initial development, phase two

283
00:17:14,214 --> 00:17:16,854
months, four to six, initial development.

284
00:17:17,185 --> 00:17:20,784
Here we execute on a limited scope,
launching a first digital twin.

285
00:17:20,935 --> 00:17:26,169
We integrate core data from systems
E-R-P-W-M-S, et cetera, develop basic

286
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:27,689
simulations and start gathering user.

287
00:17:28,044 --> 00:17:28,584
Feedback.

288
00:17:29,364 --> 00:17:32,455
Third phase months, seven
to 12, which is expansion.

289
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:34,374
This phase is about scaling up.

290
00:17:34,674 --> 00:17:40,524
We'll deploy IOTs sensors for realtime
data, improved advanced rust algorithms,

291
00:17:40,524 --> 00:17:42,324
and establish a central control tower.

292
00:17:42,864 --> 00:17:47,334
This is also when we'll perform our
first major ROI measurement and last

293
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:50,664
phase months, 13 to 18 optimization.

294
00:17:50,814 --> 00:17:54,174
In the final phase, we move
towards a fully optimized system.

295
00:17:54,504 --> 00:17:57,565
And enhance capabilities
with AI and machine learning.

296
00:17:57,594 --> 00:18:01,225
Integrating external partners for
full visibility and work towards

297
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:04,134
fully autonomous optimization.

298
00:18:04,634 --> 00:18:08,985
This structured approach balances quick
wins with long-term goals, leading to

299
00:18:08,985 --> 00:18:11,534
about a 2.7 times higher success rate.

300
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:16,184
And remember to maintain executive
sponsorship and focus on robust change

301
00:18:16,184 --> 00:18:17,684
management throughout the journey.

302
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:18,334
Alright.

303
00:18:19,084 --> 00:18:22,504
To conclude, let's review the
key takeaways and outline a clear

304
00:18:22,504 --> 00:18:24,394
path forward for the organization.

305
00:18:24,894 --> 00:18:26,304
Digital technology.

306
00:18:26,364 --> 00:18:28,314
Digital twin technology is transformative.

307
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,705
Digital twins are delivering
documented improvement in time to

308
00:18:31,705 --> 00:18:35,874
market and operational efficiency,
offering unprecedented visibility

309
00:18:35,874 --> 00:18:39,739
and control, variance based
optimized optimization performance.

310
00:18:40,324 --> 00:18:44,705
Focusing on consistency over speed,
deliver superior results with about a

311
00:18:44,705 --> 00:18:49,175
37% improvement in tracking accuracy
and significant cost reductions.

312
00:18:49,804 --> 00:18:52,324
RUS provides the essential
technical foundation.

313
00:18:52,594 --> 00:18:56,764
Its unique features like memory,
safety and fearless concurrency

314
00:18:56,764 --> 00:19:01,199
enabled next generation infrastructure
that processes high velocity data.

315
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:04,715
With microsecond level
precision implementation

316
00:19:04,715 --> 00:19:06,155
requires a holistic approach.

317
00:19:06,544 --> 00:19:10,354
Success depends on excellence
in data integration, algorithm

318
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:12,424
optimization, and change management.

319
00:19:12,724 --> 00:19:18,874
Organizations that excel in all
three achieve a 3.2 x greater ROI.

320
00:19:19,374 --> 00:19:22,674
Here are the five immediate, actionable
next steps for any organization.

321
00:19:23,124 --> 00:19:25,314
Conduct a digital maturity assessment.

322
00:19:25,674 --> 00:19:27,654
Identify your organization's readiness.

323
00:19:28,194 --> 00:19:30,774
Identify high value pilot opportunities.

324
00:19:31,014 --> 00:19:35,514
Select a manageable project with clear
KPIs and measurable ROI Potential.

325
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:39,699
And develop a technical skills
roadmap, acquired the necessary

326
00:19:39,699 --> 00:19:42,879
rest programming capabilities to
support the new infrastructure.

327
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,099
Establish data governance framework,
ensure data quality, security, consistency

328
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:52,569
for successful initiatives, and lastly,
create an executive steering committee,

329
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:57,309
establish leadership to guide and
support the transformation efforts.

330
00:19:57,939 --> 00:20:01,074
Hopefully this session was helpful
to Y all, and thank you so much.
