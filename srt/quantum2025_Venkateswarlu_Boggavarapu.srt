67
00:03:56,475 --> 00:03:58,305
Now let's come to complex architecture.

68
00:03:58,635 --> 00:03:59,295
Crucially.

69
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:02,835
A strong CDP incorporates
a complex architecture.

70
00:04:02,955 --> 00:04:07,335

It has bonded computational
capacity with sequential processing.

80
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:45,045
This results in single dimensional
data analysis that often

81
00:04:45,045 --> 00:04:46,460
requires multiple iterations.

82
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:51,035
Its performance ceiling is restricted
by classical binary architecture

83
00:04:51,305 --> 00:04:52,775
and algorithmic complexity.

00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:56,585
Scaling linearly are at a
rate that grows steadily but

85
00:04:56,735 --> 00:04:58,805
increasingly fast with problem size.

86
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:03,575
This leads to limited optimization
capabilities, especially in

87
00:05:03,575 --> 00:05:07,490
high dimensional feature spaces
and it's resource intensive.

88
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,150
Request extensive hardware infrastructure.

00:06:05,844 --> 00:06:09,685
And finally, training time is
significantly reduced through quantum

105
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:12,505
accelerated gradient decent algorithms.

106
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:16,885
The key here is the ability to handle
vast amount of data and complex

107
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:22,044
relationships at the speeds and scales
are impossible for classical ai.

108
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,960
So how does this all come together in
your real time scenario data collection?

109
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,950
It starts with capturing comprehensive
customer interactions across digital
