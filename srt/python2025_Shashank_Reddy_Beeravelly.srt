1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,840
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,089 --> 00:00:04,649
I'm Shashank Reddy Pirevelli, currently
working in Walmart as a software engineer.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,540
I'm excited to be here to explore
a topic that has a tremendous value

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,070
for business across industries.

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,409
How AI improves data quality
for better business insights.

6
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,040
In today's data driven world, accurate
and reliable data is the backbone

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,209
of any successful business decision.

8
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:23,589
However, as we know, data is often
unstructured, incomplete, or inaccurate.

9
00:00:24,354 --> 00:00:28,184
These data quality issues can result
in poor decision making, missed

10
00:00:28,184 --> 00:00:30,024
opportunities, and inefficiencies.

11
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:33,804
In this session, we'll explore
how artificial intelligence is

12
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:37,734
transforming data quality management
by offering advanced solutions.

13
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:42,934
We'll also dive into real world challenges
as well as how AI approaches in sectors

14
00:00:42,934 --> 00:00:45,434
like financial services and manufacturing.

15
00:00:45,934 --> 00:00:49,044
Today, we are facing a number of
challenges across data quality.

16
00:00:49,284 --> 00:00:51,344
Let me highlight a few key issues.

17
00:00:52,104 --> 00:00:55,574
Data team often spend about 40
percent of their time dealing with

18
00:00:55,574 --> 00:01:00,314
quality issues, which can consume up
to 25 percent of operation budget.

19
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,864
This result in substantial
loss of productivity.

20
00:01:03,704 --> 00:01:06,064
Next, we have the issue
of critical data gaps.

21
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:10,974
Many enterprise systems functions at
only 75 to 80 percent completeness,

22
00:01:11,554 --> 00:01:15,134
leaving important insights hidden
due to missing or incomplete data.

23
00:01:16,014 --> 00:01:18,664
Another challenge is the
issue with duplicate records.

24
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:23,979
Around 25 to 30% of customer and vendor
record contain duplicates resulting

25
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:27,849
in waste resources and leading to
inconsistent customer interaction.

26
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:33,329
Lastly, corporate data become outdated
at a rate of approximately 23% per

27
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,909
year, and B2B data is even more
volatile, degrading by 36% annually.

28
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:43,719
This rapid rate of data decay makes
it increasing difficult to rely on

29
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:45,579
information for accurate decision making.

30
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,999
These challenges not only affect
productivity, but also hinder overall

31
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,509
business performance and growth.

32
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:55,949
Now let's talk about how AI
power solutions are transforming

33
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,209
data quality management.

34
00:01:57,709 --> 00:02:01,019
With advanced AI algorithms,
we can automatically detect

35
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:02,699
and fix data inconsistencies.

36
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:07,989
This reduces error rate by an impressive
67 percent and process data 50 times

37
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:10,189
faster than the traditional methods.

38
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:14,619
Moreover, natural language processing
models are now being used to

39
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:19,109
standardize data across multiple
languages, achieving 94 percent

40
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:23,849
accuracy and ensuring consistent
data quality and on a global scale.

41
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:27,919
Additionally, using advanced
machine learning models, AI can

42
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,009
intelligently fill data gaps with
91 percent accuracy, eliminating

43
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:33,889
the need for manual data entry.

44
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,989
In real time, AI validation systems
can process up to 850k records per

45
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:42,639
minute, maintaining an impressive 99.

46
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,476
5 percent accuracy.

47
00:02:43,476 --> 00:02:46,264
This ensures errors are detected
and corrected before, and after.

48
00:02:46,804 --> 00:02:48,684
The impact critical business decisions.

49
00:02:49,404 --> 00:02:54,014
These AI solutions are drastically
improving both the speed and accurate

50
00:02:54,014 --> 00:03:00,254
of data management, making it easier to
ensure high quality data across the board.

51
00:03:00,754 --> 00:03:05,104
Let's now look at the impact of AI
powered solutions in financial services.

52
00:03:05,914 --> 00:03:07,854
Thanks to machine learning algorithms.

53
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:12,459
We can accelerate transaction validation
and fraud detection by 250 times.

54
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:16,799
This significantly speeds up the
processing and validation of transactions,

55
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:21,239
allowing business to respond to potential
issues much faster and more effectively.

56
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,319
Next, we observe 35
percent reduction in cost.

57
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:28,579
By leveraging smart automation and
predictive maintenance, operational

58
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:30,619
