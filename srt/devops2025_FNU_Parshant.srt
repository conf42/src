00:02:19,905 --> 00:02:25,375
Previous interconnects supported
speed up of up to 100 Gbps, which

34
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:29,345
while impressive, introduced
latency at the millisecond scale.

35
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:33,625
This was sufficient for many
traditional HPC applications like

36
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:38,765
