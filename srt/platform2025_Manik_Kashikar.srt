1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,700
Greetings for the day.

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:05,660
Thank you for joining today's
session where we will explore how

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,380
platform engineering can bridge the
gap between the promise of digital

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,840
transformation and its actual impact.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,719
I'm marnic a platform architect.

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,100
Meet my co-presenter.

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,360
Hello, I'm Trata, and I'm a
student as well as a digital

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,100
transformation enthusiast.

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,360
We bring prospective from both
the business and technology sites.

10
00:00:26,705 --> 00:00:32,694
So we look at transformation not just as
a buzzword, but as an operating model that

11
00:00:32,694 --> 00:00:36,295
delivers scale, agility, and resilience.

12
00:00:36,795 --> 00:00:42,994
Digital transformation leads every
corporate agenda, but many organization

13
00:00:43,024 --> 00:00:46,564
finds that the impact is very limited.

14
00:00:47,284 --> 00:00:47,674
Why?

15
00:00:48,094 --> 00:00:51,244
There are many reasons to
it, but just to quote a few.

16
00:00:51,814 --> 00:00:55,834
One of the reason is there are
too many silos, duplications, and

17
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:59,824
a legacy complexity that exist
in the organization's ecosystem.

18
00:01:00,274 --> 00:01:03,274
They struggle to scale cost efficiently.

19
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:08,494
There is often a lack of agility
that prevents launching new

20
00:01:08,494 --> 00:01:10,894
products faster and quickly.

21
00:01:11,225 --> 00:01:17,195
So while business demands speed and
innovation, technology often gets drawn

22
00:01:17,315 --> 00:01:23,345
in complexity, that's where platform
engineering provides a digital platform.

23
00:01:23,845 --> 00:01:25,975
So now what is a platform?

24
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:28,525
A platform is more than technology.

25
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,180
It's a reusable digital foundation.

26
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:37,870
It abstracts away complexity, standardizes
how we operate and accelerates innovation.

27
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,330
Think of it like town planning.

28
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:45,490
Instead of building random houses,
we design roads, utilities, and rules

29
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,830
that let the city grow efficiently.

30
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:53,745
Similarly, platforms enable business
and engineering teams to build at

31
00:01:53,745 --> 00:01:55,740
speed and scale types of platforms.

32
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:00,200
We break platform strategy
into four categories.

33
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:04,670
Engineering platform it as
a service for developers.

34
00:02:05,029 --> 00:02:07,520
This is about developer efficiency.

35
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,820
By offering self-service infrastructure
pipelines and monitoring, we reduce

36
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,070
friction and repetitive tasks.

37
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:20,899
Developers can then focus on building
business value instead of plumbing.

38
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,529
It's about moving from
firefighting to value creation.

39
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,060
Second business capabilities
platform business as a

40
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,310
service for speed and agility.

41
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,779
Think of this as the business
engine, instead of fragmented IT

42
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:40,820
solutions, business capabilities
are bundled as reusable services.

43
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,464
This allows rapid product launches,
agility in responding to change,

44
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:50,480
and a modular architecture that
embraces continuous transformation.

45
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:56,870
Data, platform data as a service,
empowering insights and experimentation.

46
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,350
Data is the oil of modern enterprises.

47
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,610
A data platform enables
discovery, creation, and

48
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,530
consumption of data products.

49
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:12,079
With proper governance, with real
type pipelines, it drives insights,

50
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,840
experimentation, and decision making.

51
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,310
This is how organizations unlock
data-driven culture at a scale.

52
00:03:20,029 --> 00:03:25,219
Customer experience platform journey
as a service, enabling consistent

53
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,500
and personalized experiences.

54
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,849
Here, the focus shifts to the end user.

55
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:36,260
A CX platform unifies the
customer journey across channels.

56
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:41,360
One profile, consistent personalization,
seamless onboarding of partners.

57
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,649
It's about delivering one brand,
one experience, irrespective of

58
00:03:45,649 --> 00:03:47,779
channel or partner ecosystem.

59
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:52,375
Each there builds on the other,
creating a full stack digital backbone.

60
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:58,935
Platform thinking is not about building
one of tools or isolated think systems.

61
00:03:59,435 --> 00:04:05,165
It's about designing reusable capabilities
that can be shared across the enterprise.

62
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:07,385
Delivery infrastructure.

63
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:12,725
Instead of every team setting up their
own CICD pipelines, cloud accounts,

64
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:17,195
and monitoring, the platform team
provides them as a ready to use secure

65
00:04:17,195 --> 00:04:23,135
foundation, API, and architecture
remediation service boundaries, gateways,

66
00:04:23,284 --> 00:04:27,935
and even driven architectures are made
consistent, so product teams don't

67
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,424
reinvent governance every single time.

68
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,090
Self-service data.

69
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,570
Data is packaged as products, clean,
discoverable, and ready for consumption.

70
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,060
Teams no longer hunt for data sets.

71
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,980
They simply subscribe to them,
experimentation and telemetry.

72
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,300
New ideas can be tested safely
with real time telemetry,

73
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,850
feature toggles and control roll.

74
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,390
So innovation becomes
responsible and scalable.

75
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,930
Customer touch points,
every customer interaction.

76
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:05,570
Whether web app or partner portal
feels seamless because platforms ensure

77
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:10,640
consistency in the personalization,
routing, and content strategy.

78
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:17,000
So the outcome delivering faster, build
ecosystems, gain insights, experiment

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,330
responsibly, consistent experience.

80
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,440
This is the power of platform thinking.

81
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:27,940
It shifts organizations from
fragmented delivery to enterprise

82
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,190
wise scalability and resilience.

83
00:05:30,655 --> 00:05:34,495
So what is digital transformation?

84
00:05:35,095 --> 00:05:41,155
This evolution is the journey just from
simply convert to automate, to transform.

85
00:05:41,455 --> 00:05:47,035
So now let's discuss this three terms,
which are often used interchangeably.

86
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,935
Digitization, convert analog to digital.

87
00:05:51,115 --> 00:05:52,825
It's just like scanning paper.

88
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,430
Digitalization, automate existing
workflows and digital transformation.

89
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:05,810
Reman reimagining how business
creates and delivers value

90
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,700
with technology at the core.

91
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,320
Now let's discuss why platforms matter.

92
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:17,140
For digital transformation, a system
centric approach slows us down.

93
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,230
Applications are siloed,
integrations are brittle.

94
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,020
A platform approach changes the game.

95
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:27,610
Speed and agility through self-service
capabilities, scalability and

96
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,840
resilience via cloud native
foundations simplification.

97
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:37,180
So teams focus on business value and
innovation at scale, unlocking new

98
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,850
business models and revenue systems.

99
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:45,370
Now I hand over to my core speaker
to talk about this particular problem

100
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,775
statement in the healthcare domain.

101
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:50,395
Now, so far, we have understood
the various terminologies about

102
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:53,945
what is platform thinking approach,
and what is platform engineering

103
00:06:54,005 --> 00:06:56,015
along with digital transformation.

104
00:06:56,315 --> 00:07:00,545
Now, let's understand and pick up a use
case in a healthcare domain, which is

105
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:05,225
related to the invoice processing, and
how do we apply what we have learned

106
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:09,995
so far to this problem statement to
digitally transform their business?

107
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:12,235
Here goes the use case.

108
00:07:13,135 --> 00:07:18,265
So medical invoicing today is highly
manual, paper driven and error prone

109
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:23,455
processing, which processes over a
million of documents weekly with a

110
00:07:23,455 --> 00:07:26,005
significant dependency on human effort.

111
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:28,525
Each invoice requires manual.

112
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:33,765
Physical verification of signature and
stamps and manual forwarding to claims

113
00:07:33,765 --> 00:07:37,425
management team and various other
departments for further processing.

114
00:07:37,965 --> 00:07:42,975
This results in a heavily manual
operations that demands significant

115
00:07:42,975 --> 00:07:47,285
number of full-time resources for
end-to-end processing the claims.

116
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:50,545
Area is growing in the
various geographies.

117
00:07:50,545 --> 00:07:55,375
As you say, the market size is
significantly large in the North

118
00:07:55,435 --> 00:07:57,745
America, Europe, AsiaPac Pacific.

119
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:03,525
Now, while we have understood the current
state of this problem, how are we tackling

120
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,445
this problem in the today's world?

121
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:09,065
Let's understand what kind
of inefficiencies it brings.

122
00:08:09,664 --> 00:08:14,044
To the system first, it brings
lot of operational inefficiencies

123
00:08:14,104 --> 00:08:18,754
in a way that, first, the invoice
processing consumes substantial

124
00:08:18,754 --> 00:08:20,825
manual hours on a monthly basis.

125
00:08:21,004 --> 00:08:24,904
Second, this leads to the high
susceptibility to data entry

126
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,705
errors and fraudulent claims.

127
00:08:27,455 --> 00:08:29,984
Third, there is a limited
accessibility and a real time

128
00:08:29,984 --> 00:08:32,355
visibility to stakeholders.

129
00:08:32,924 --> 00:08:35,879
Fourth, this has increased cost to serve.

130
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:40,010
Reimbursements and reduce
provider satisfaction.

131
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:45,050
In addition to that, there is
also a challenge associated with

132
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,719
scalability and susceptibility.

133
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:52,839
The current system cannot scale
with increasing invoice volumes.

134
00:08:52,915 --> 00:08:57,324
There is a dependency on paper-based
workflows, which contradicts

135
00:08:57,385 --> 00:09:00,084
digital and environmental goals.

136
00:09:00,655 --> 00:09:05,635
Inefficient workflows strain, both
operational budgets and compliance

137
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:11,545
postures, which leads to claim
denials and delay in reimbursements.

138
00:09:11,814 --> 00:09:16,095
Now what we are trying to propose
is a flow, which is built.

139
00:09:16,595 --> 00:09:20,825
Using a platform thinking
approach and how we have digitally

140
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:23,165
transformed the entire ecosystem.

141
00:09:23,945 --> 00:09:28,295
Let's see, so there are multiple
personas which are using this

142
00:09:28,295 --> 00:09:33,935
particular digi digitally transform
flow for the invoice processing.

143
00:09:33,965 --> 00:09:37,805
We have various personas, right
from the healthcare organization

144
00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:39,245
to the insurance organization.

145
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:46,055
Along with the partner channel, who
also helps to analyze and actually

146
00:09:46,055 --> 00:09:50,885
process the claims for the healthcare
organization as a third party supporters.

147
00:09:51,185 --> 00:09:55,895
And in addition, we also have a internal
admin and a support team who are using

148
00:09:55,955 --> 00:09:58,955
our digital transformation process.

149
00:09:58,955 --> 00:10:00,155
The workflow.

150
00:10:00,905 --> 00:10:07,415
Now, let's see how the health healthcare
organization wanted to, who wanted to.

151
00:10:07,915 --> 00:10:14,005
Process the claims via uploading the
invoices will happen in this workflow.

152
00:10:14,505 --> 00:10:20,055
In the digitally transformed workflow, so
first, the healthcare organization uploads

153
00:10:20,115 --> 00:10:24,944
a bunch of invoices for claim processing
through a web portal interface, which

154
00:10:24,944 --> 00:10:26,895
is provided by this invoicing system.

155
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:32,175
Second, the batch of invoices are
verified for sanity checks and

156
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:35,295
it'll get stored in a cloud storage.

157
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:41,025
Third, each invoice is scanned via
OCR and NLP solutions to extract.

158
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:46,380
The required information, and this is
where we actually do the digitalization.

159
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,510
The fourth step is extracting the
signature and stamps available for each

160
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:56,700
invoice via deep learning solutions
and save it again on the cloud storage.

161
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,870
Next it moves to the next
department wherein the government

162
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:05,040
representative will audit and verify
the signature and stamps manually.

163
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,200
And provide an approval.

164
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:12,330
Please note that here we have
introduced human in the loop so as to

165
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,760
avoid any fraudulent at this stage.

166
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,140
Upon approval, the invoice
batch will be sent to claims

167
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,180
department for further processing.

168
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:26,820
The insurance company representative will
take the invoices for further validation.

169
00:11:26,835 --> 00:11:32,565
And either approve, reject, or ask
for more information for the claim

170
00:11:32,565 --> 00:11:37,245
processing, and the UpToDate status
will be reflected on the web portal.

171
00:11:37,815 --> 00:11:42,135
If the claim is approved by insurance
company, the payment workflow

172
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:45,645
will be triggered via payment
interface and the amount will be

173
00:11:45,645 --> 00:11:47,175
credited to the patient's account.

174
00:11:48,045 --> 00:11:53,205
If the approver requires any additional
information about the invoice, it'll

175
00:11:53,205 --> 00:11:55,665
be moved to the on hold status.

176
00:11:56,165 --> 00:12:02,315
However, in case the claim is considered
as fraud or due to insufficient

177
00:12:02,315 --> 00:12:08,195
documentation, it'll be reported as
rejected, and this is how the current

178
00:12:08,555 --> 00:12:14,345
manual process is entirely digitized using
a platform thinking approach along with

179
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,595
applying the digital transformation lens.

180
00:12:17,095 --> 00:12:19,645
Our strategic focus here is very clear.

181
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:23,695
We move from digitization to
digitalization and then entirely

182
00:12:23,755 --> 00:12:26,665
transforming the workflow
into digital transformation.

183
00:12:27,165 --> 00:12:30,915
The shift is from manual to
digital transformation, embed

184
00:12:31,005 --> 00:12:35,955
AI to detect fraud and ensure
compliance, transform the invoicing

185
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:39,975
journey end to end with automation
enabling scalability and accuracy.

186
00:12:39,975 --> 00:12:44,235
C. Let's also discuss the key
milestones in this transformation.

187
00:12:44,535 --> 00:12:47,085
This journey unfolds in phases.

188
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:51,495
Start the value stream mapping and
launching the e-invoicing platform.

189
00:12:51,555 --> 00:12:54,645
Integrate O-C-R-N-L-P and fraud detection.

190
00:12:54,945 --> 00:12:57,525
Automate workflows across stakeholders.

191
00:12:57,765 --> 00:13:02,950
Deploy real-time dashboards finally
expand across networks and geographies.

192
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,680
Each milestone builds maturity
and unlock measurable value.

193
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,650
Let's quickly have a
glance at the roadmap.

194
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:15,300
Our roadmap runs as a multi-year
program scaling from core implementation

195
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,890
to full ecosystem adoption.

196
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:24,660
Importantly, this solution evolve to be an
industry agnostic and platform agnostic.

197
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:30,990
This means the lessons from medical
invoices we will apply to further extend

198
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:36,480
it to other industries like insurance,
retail, as well as finance, and many more.

199
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,990
Now let's understand here that how we
have enabled the digital transformation

200
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,880
using platform thinking lens.

201
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:49,420
Let's consider the same use case that
we are discussing now, which was a paper

202
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,440
heavy labor intensive and prone to errors.

203
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,840
Now applying platform thinking
transformation into this we made it

204
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,570
digital first and AI enabled workflow.

205
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,940
There is a shared ingestion layer
for all invoices, whether it is from

206
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:08,630
hospitals, insurance partners, or
government entities, which comes

207
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,580
through a single digital portal.

208
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,790
This ensures consistency and traceability.

209
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,960
The customer interacts via two channels.

210
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:22,390
One is a web portal and others a chatbot
for submission of their invoices.

211
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,680
Second, there is a u
reusable data services.

212
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:33,340
So instead of manual entry, O-C-R-N-L-P
engines are automating the entire

213
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,080
metadata extraction signature, and
staff stamp validation process.

214
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:43,060
These services aren't built for
one team, but they are reusable

215
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,900
across various departments, be
it claims compliance, or audit.

216
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,545
Third is a validation as a service, the
AI models and human in the loop framework.

217
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:55,215
Validates invoices against business rules.

218
00:14:55,305 --> 00:15:00,225
The fraud detection and anomaly
checks run as a shared capability.

219
00:15:00,705 --> 00:15:04,635
Fourth is a claim processing
platform wherein we are routing,

220
00:15:04,694 --> 00:15:07,995
auditing, approvals, and
the entire payment gateways.

221
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:11,655
They run through an orchestrated
workflow, which is designed

222
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,875
as modular trace and scalable.

223
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:18,885
The final on the top is the experience
layer wherein the customer's

224
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,655
insurance and the regulators.

225
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,190
Get real time status updates via chatbots,
as well as real time dashboards to

226
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,790
which delivers transparency and trust.

227
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,010
The shift is profound.

228
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:36,390
Instead of switching together fragmented
workflows, we build a platform backbone.

229
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:41,130
Instead of scaling people linearly,
we scale capabilities exponentially.

230
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:45,075
Instead of operational risk, we
build compliance into the process.

231
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:49,455
By design, there is a sense of
enabling digital transformation through

232
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:54,135
platform thinking, which converts a
broken manual journey into a future

233
00:15:54,135 --> 00:16:00,225
proof reusable capability stack that
can extend beyond medical invoicing

234
00:16:00,465 --> 00:16:02,955
to the entire insurance ecosystem.

235
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:07,005
Now let's see how we
can define the success.

236
00:16:07,815 --> 00:16:10,485
While there are ma many
measures through which we can.

237
00:16:11,355 --> 00:16:13,695
Define as well as measure the success.

238
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:19,125
We think these are the three
important dimensions, which should

239
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:23,145
be definitely considered while
we define the success metrics.

240
00:16:23,145 --> 00:16:24,885
The first is the customer metrics.

241
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:30,375
Second is the business value wherein
we ensure fraud reduction, compliance

242
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,475
by design and lower cost to serve.

243
00:16:32,715 --> 00:16:36,405
And third, an important aspect
of it is an operational metric.

244
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,120
Wherein we will measure the system uptime,
which is nothing but the availability of

245
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,400
the system, the accuracy of the system,
fraud detection rates, and the throughput.

246
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:52,020
Success is when customer,
business and operations are all

247
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,900
aligned on measurable impact.

248
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,380
So our message is simple.

249
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:01,610
Platform engineering is the
backbone of digital transformation.

250
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,910
It bridges the gap between
ambition and reality.

251
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:09,185
Enabling organizations to move
faster, safer, and smarter.

252
00:17:09,815 --> 00:17:12,185
We appreciate your time
and attention today.

253
00:17:12,185 --> 00:17:15,514
We hope our perspective adds
value, and today's session

254
00:17:15,514 --> 00:17:17,105
leaves you with fresh insights.

255
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,395
Happy learning.

256
00:17:18,895 --> 00:17:19,405
Thank you.
