1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,009
Good morning.

2
00:00:01,069 --> 00:00:02,210
Good evening to everyone.

3
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,120
Welcome to conference 42.

4
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,690
Today I'm here to present a
project that I've been working on,

5
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,010
which is called Dragon Copilot.

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,610
It's a AI provide clinical assistant
and transforming healthcare

7
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,140
workflows and patient care.

8
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,419
Let me introducing myself.

9
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,755
My name is Ku Lato.

10
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:21,040
I'm a senior software
developer here in Microsoft.

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,070
I've been doing the software
development for past 10 years.

12
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:28,660
From this 10 years I had experience
working with automobile, with a TS state

13
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,130
government, and also with the telecom
and healthcare, especially in healthcare.

14
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,830
I've been working five to six years,
either with Nuance Communications or

15
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:40,510
Microsoft As part of this healthcare,
we started on initiate initiation,

16
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,920
that's called Dragon Copilot.

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,160
Before I dive into more on what
this abstract of this project, let

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,930
me start by saying a story of this
project nearly starts before COVID.

19
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,100
All of you guys know how
the COVID pandemic affected.

20
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,970
Especially healthcare doc
patients, there is lot of patients.

21
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,129
The doctor has to visit each patient.

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,750
Once they completed the visit, doctor
has to go fill the documentation,

23
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,210
prescribe the medications,
and come back next patient.

24
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,020
So because of this burdensome
work, doctors cannot able to

25
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:17,950
concentrate on the patient and they
cannot able to help more patients.

26
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,280
Per day because they have to
spend after hours work as well.

27
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,710
Again they have also family.

28
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,990
They have to go to the family and
take care of the family as well.

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,880
That thought especially
helped this project in a way.

30
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,145
How can we do much better so
that we can help both healthcare.

31
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:36,275
Doctors and even the patients as well.

32
00:01:36,815 --> 00:01:40,385
So let me give you, based on the story,
let me give you guys a small abstract.

33
00:01:40,675 --> 00:01:44,875
What it'll do, streamline documentation,
it'll assistance, simplifies the clinical

34
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:48,205
documentation, reduces the administration
task for healthcare provisional

35
00:01:48,535 --> 00:01:50,395
and also advanced AI technologies.

36
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:55,885
We use a ambient recording and LZ national
language processor, which can perform.

37
00:01:55,975 --> 00:01:59,935
Process between conversation
between doctor and patients, it'll

38
00:01:59,935 --> 00:02:01,705
improve the patient care as well.

39
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:05,965
Reduces the admin burden,
allows doctors to focus more

40
00:02:05,965 --> 00:02:07,585
on patient care and outcomes.

41
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,685
Workflow integration and compliance.

42
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:13,615
Seamless integration ensures
timely, accurate documentation and

43
00:02:13,615 --> 00:02:15,535
compliment with healthcare standards.

44
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,645
Let me give you guys problems
that they're facing today and

45
00:02:18,645 --> 00:02:19,875
the solutions as well for that.

46
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:25,430
As I said in the story it's more on
what problems the doctors are facing.

47
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,140
Time consuming documentation.

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,440
Yes.

49
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,160
As I said before, doctors
have been doing documentation.

50
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,205
They have to con, it'll con consume
significant time, and there will

51
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:37,715
be a documentary as it'll not be
perfect and patient has to come again.

52
00:02:37,715 --> 00:02:39,275
Doctors has to visit them again.

53
00:02:39,695 --> 00:02:43,265
And also all doing this
physician will burn out.

54
00:02:43,265 --> 00:02:44,855
Doctors will get burned out easily.

55
00:02:45,185 --> 00:02:49,445
So that to help this, we need
to automate this process.

56
00:02:49,445 --> 00:02:52,275
That's where the third part, that's
where the thought began and we

57
00:02:52,275 --> 00:02:54,735
brought that back to life solution.

58
00:02:54,765 --> 00:02:57,645
What we did as part of
Dragon Copilot is ai.

59
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,595
It's AI proper clinical documentation.

60
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:03,645
Dragon copilot automates the clinical
workflows using ai, enabling physicians

61
00:03:03,645 --> 00:03:07,695
to focus more on patient care
and enhanced patient interaction.

62
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:13,550
93% of patients noted physicians seems
more at attend to and personally with

63
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:17,690
the dry copilot support, so they don't
have to go do the documentation so they

64
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,430
can spend more time with the patients.

65
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:24,045
And another one is melting wheel and
secure solution supports melting wheel

66
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:28,545
transcription, secure data migration, and
accessibility complaints for healthcare.

67
00:03:28,995 --> 00:03:35,715
So what it means is either doctor or
patient in a different, talking different

68
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,465
languages or probably from different
regions, it can help them as well.

69
00:03:39,465 --> 00:03:41,475
It can transcribe it
in different languages.

70
00:03:41,475 --> 00:03:45,495
It can show you the note, it can show you
the transcription, how doctor wants it.

71
00:03:45,795 --> 00:03:47,265
It'll also solve the problem.

72
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:50,645
Let me give you guys the technical
architecture and technologies,

73
00:03:51,185 --> 00:03:52,265
technical architecture.

74
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:57,195
As I said, we have the ambient recording
that is much more ai driven flow.

75
00:03:57,705 --> 00:04:01,635
It'll capture the real time conversation
between physicians and patients using

76
00:04:01,635 --> 00:04:03,585
advanced ambient recording technology.

77
00:04:03,855 --> 00:04:09,005
So it'll grab that conversation
that'll send you to the NLG process

78
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:12,565
and NLG will process it recording
between doctor and patient.

79
00:04:12,565 --> 00:04:13,555
It'll generate the note.

80
00:04:13,555 --> 00:04:14,575
It'll generate the note.

81
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:19,675
Transcript and then deliver back to
the doctor so the doctor can easily see

82
00:04:19,675 --> 00:04:25,605
what they have recorded, what what they
have got the note and what prescriptions

83
00:04:25,605 --> 00:04:27,045
they have ordered for these patients.

84
00:04:27,045 --> 00:04:28,845
If they want to review,
they can do it as well.

85
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:32,805
And also here we are using wise dictation.

86
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:36,225
Doctors don't have to type if they
want to, if they see that note.

87
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,080
Some error, some something is there.

88
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,900
They can do the wise dictation
and a summarization without

89
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,820
doing any hands keyboard work or
doing any work with the hands.

90
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,990
They can easily talk.

91
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,930
They can modify the note,
they can edit the note.

92
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,450
And then HR integration Security.

93
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,225
We helped this solution to be part of EHR.

94
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,890
Health systems as well, so that
that proves he HR is a major

95
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,270
role playing in healthcare today.

96
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,805
So that proves the how This Do com project
is evolving in real healthcare world.

97
00:05:08,305 --> 00:05:09,265
Key technologies.

98
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:11,325
We talked about ambient
recording, how it works.

99
00:05:11,325 --> 00:05:13,785
We talked about an LNL lu, how it works.

100
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:17,035
It'll capture the recording
between doctor and patient.

101
00:05:17,035 --> 00:05:21,195
And LU will enable the accurate
interception of the spoken language to

102
00:05:21,225 --> 00:05:23,175
external relevant medical information.

103
00:05:23,175 --> 00:05:23,835
Effectively.

104
00:05:23,835 --> 00:05:28,125
Why is dictation allows doctors to dictate
and edit note if something seems wrong.

105
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:31,005
If they want to add more,
they can voice dictation.

106
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:32,385
They don't have to type anything.

107
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:36,830
Generate a models, transform unstructured
input into structural clinical

108
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:42,290
documentation, improving accuracy and
efficiency, implementation and security.

109
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,800
Let's talk a bit more on the
implementation, how we did things, and

110
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,690
how we focused on security as well.

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,740
Implementation details, project life.

112
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,560
Cycle management, managed entire
project lifecycle, including designing,

113
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,190
implementation and quality, assistant
coordination, technical contributions.

114
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,660
We focused on mobile web
development, user interfaces design.

115
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,570
We use restful APIs development,
and Epic high code testing

116
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,100
because it's been part of Epic.

117
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,000
So we have to make sure Epic
customers also feel secure.

118
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,400
Frameworks and design
patterns that we have used.

119
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,240
We have used cocoa frameworks, react
frameworks, and we have designed in

120
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,090
M-V-M-M-U-C in designing patterns.

121
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:23,930
We have used Java script, REDX type
scrap as well, code management tools.

122
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,940
As usual, everybody uses.

123
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,290
We use SV and GATE for efficiency
via washing controls, security and

124
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:35,840
compliance, especially when it comes
to healthcare Security is major concern

125
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,210
and we have to, how to follow hipaa.

126
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:39,665
Security rules.

127
00:06:39,905 --> 00:06:43,655
And also we have to follow the
compliance so we don't leak any data.

128
00:06:43,655 --> 00:06:48,445
We don't leak show one doctor's
information to the another doctor, to

129
00:06:48,445 --> 00:06:50,695
another doctor that's against HIPAA rules.

130
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:52,525
So data security and encryption.

131
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:56,575
We have data from voice dictation and
ambient recording, as you guys know,

132
00:06:56,575 --> 00:06:58,375
is encrypted, completely encrypted.

133
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:58,825
Nobody.

134
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,120
Can decrypt that it's securely
stored and protected confidentially.

135
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,810
Regular regulatory of compliance,
the platform compliance with

136
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,340
healthcare regulations like hipaa.

137
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,970
As I said, ensuring legal and
ethical documentation, standards,

138
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,170
accessibility and includes.

139
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,960
If you see Microsoft, it's much more
focused on accessibility drives,

140
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,550
user needs, and also we can help
the usually impaired users as well.

141
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,300
They can use this app still
and they can benefit from it.

142
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,845
When we, when I say this, it's
not, it seems easy, but there

143
00:07:28,845 --> 00:07:32,955
is lot of changes, challenges,
impact and contributions to it.

144
00:07:33,255 --> 00:07:35,645
Let's talk about challenges and solutions.

145
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:40,125
We said, this will help doctors and
patients to, in even multilingual

146
00:07:40,185 --> 00:07:44,655
AI support, or even it'll generate
the note and transcript, you

147
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:46,965
can use AI models and whatnot.

148
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:52,215
But the challenges here is multilingual
AI support, robust AI models developed for

149
00:07:52,215 --> 00:07:56,250
accurate transcription in multi-languages,
enhancing usability across.

150
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,280
Diverse use, diverse users.

151
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,630
Secure data migration.

152
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,810
Data migration is very
much painful process.

153
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:08,430
Here we have to ensure integrity,
unsecurity, minimizing risk of data

154
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,040
loss or breaches during the transfer.

155
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:15,330
Healthcare compliance frameworks work
integrated to met healthcare regulations

156
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,585
and accessibility standards, ensuring
system reliability results and impact.

157
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:21,745
Yes, we have challenges.

158
00:08:22,405 --> 00:08:23,105
We have problems.

159
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,400
But we've come to a point where we
have shown how this project work and

160
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,180
the results of the project is we have
improved the document efficiency.

161
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,550
Dragon Co enhances clinical documentation,
improving recording quality and

162
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:40,930
operational efficiency, significantly
increased physician patient interaction.

163
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,980
Yes, as I said before, IT, physicians
spend more time with patients and

164
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,390
less an administrative during Dragon
Co palate, better work-life balance.

165
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,470
This system contributes to improve work
life balance for healthcare providers

166
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,540
by reducing administrative burden.

167
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,530
Doctors can go spend time with it.

168
00:08:58,165 --> 00:09:00,835
Families and they can take care
of their families as well and

169
00:09:00,835 --> 00:09:03,205
has patient per perception.

170
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:09,025
93% of patients feel their physicians are
more responsible under attentive, using

171
00:09:09,025 --> 00:09:11,430
the Dragon copilot personal contributions.

172
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,700
This is a big project.

173
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,680
A lot of teams came
together and developed this.

174
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,880
And what I, personal contributions I have
done is leadership in product development,

175
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,170
lead end to end development of features
on mobile and web platforms, driving

176
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,640
innovations and cross team collaborations,
cross platform and native development.

177
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,425
I have been heavily invested into the
mobile with different technologies

178
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:36,170
like shift and Object you see and
web react to, and TypeScript as well.

179
00:09:36,745 --> 00:09:40,675
Software architecture and AI
integration focused, scalable software

180
00:09:40,675 --> 00:09:45,355
architecture, because we are part of
a big company, Microsoft, whatever we

181
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:50,605
design, it has to be scalable to the
million of customers, and we have to

182
00:09:51,115 --> 00:09:54,895
integrate AI solutions to enhance this
healthcare technology applications.

183
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:58,705
As I said, this is much more
focused healthcare plus ai.

184
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:02,455
That's the major core
concept of this product.

185
00:10:02,955 --> 00:10:03,675
Conclusion.

186
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:08,955
So let me come giving, give you guys
some conclusion about how it uses

187
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:10,925
AI enhances healthcare efficiency.

188
00:10:11,225 --> 00:10:15,305
Automation of clinical documentation
improves efficiency and supports

189
00:10:15,305 --> 00:10:20,255
healthcare providers in delivering quality
Note advanced AI technologies, future of

190
00:10:20,255 --> 00:10:23,705
patient care in a way to area solutions
like Dragon copilot shape the future.

191
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,230
Of patient care and clinical
operations, collaborate on excellence.

192
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,160
Success highlights that importance
of the interdisciplinary

193
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,450
collaboration and technical
excellence in healthcare innovation.

194
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:40,860
Yeah, this is, I'm done, but this
project is much more, as I say, much more

195
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,990
worth in future prospectives as well.

196
00:10:43,635 --> 00:10:47,115
We our plan is to deliver this to
the, all the doctors across the

197
00:10:47,115 --> 00:10:49,305
globe so that they can use it.

198
00:10:49,395 --> 00:10:55,185
And we may come out of the situation
that we have been in the pandemic.

199
00:10:55,435 --> 00:11:01,485
Because of, very much physician burnouts
that happen with this, we can save

200
00:11:01,945 --> 00:11:05,575
lot more patients, doctors can visit
a lot more patients within the day.

201
00:11:06,175 --> 00:11:06,745
Thank you so much.
