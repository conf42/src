1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,810
Hi there.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,800
Welcome to my talk show at
con 42 Site Label Engineering.

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:10,470
So today's topic is data engineering
in healthcare, how it is transforming

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,870
personalized medicine and diagnosis.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,660
So data engineering is transforming
the healthcare in big way fundamentally

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,900
changing the personalized medicine
and diagnostic approaches, and also

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,380
implementing a clinical settings
by creating robust infrastructure.

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,260
Basically the data engineering enables
comprehensive patient profiles that

9
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,510
supports truly personalized treatment.

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,599
So this also taking care of the
foundation, addressing complex

11
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:47,480
challenges, which are including the
data integration across all systems, and

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,170
also the scalability of exponentially
growing information volumes.

13
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,050
Data governance, quality governance,
and advanced analytics requirements.

14
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:03,670
As healthcare continues, its digital
transformation, data engineering, evolving

15
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:09,945
challenges related to privacy production,
and this also taking care of edge

16
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:12,075
computing for point of care diagnostics.

17
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,380
Includes the design for
diverse populations and ethical

18
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,750
implementations of artificial inte.

19
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,305
In clinical workflow, the found the
foundation of personalized healthcare.

20
00:01:23,935 --> 00:01:28,054
So there are certain f the foundations
which are which plays the important

21
00:01:28,174 --> 00:01:32,524
role, which are genomic information,
that clinical history integration, and

22
00:01:32,524 --> 00:01:36,065
the lifecycle and environmental data.

23
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:38,389
And the data engineering infrastructure.

24
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:43,659
So for the genomic information the cost
of this is going to be like, dropped

25
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:50,019
dramatically from a hundred million
2021, 2001 to just thousand in 2023.

26
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:54,899
Enabling widespread critical
approach and coming to the clinic.

27
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,269
History integration this is a
confidential patient profiles

28
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:00,889
incorporate medical records.

29
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:06,529
Treatment is three and the diagnostic
result across previously sliced systems

30
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:10,039
and the lifetime and environmental data.

31
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:15,819
So these are the certain variable devices
and environmental sensor providers,

32
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:21,129
continuous monitoring, contributing to
the 48% of annual growth in healthcare

33
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:25,229
data volume and coming to the final
data engineering infrastructure.

34
00:02:25,529 --> 00:02:28,319
This is where the data
engineering design complex.

35
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:34,269
Pipelines to process the data
which is 2, 3, 1 4 exabytes of

36
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:36,519
healthcare data expected by 2030.

37
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:39,509
Data collection and
integration challenges.

38
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:43,959
Healthcare data is in credibility,
diverse from the EHRs and

39
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,634
images to variable and genomic.

40
00:02:46,114 --> 00:02:46,894
Sequences.

41
00:02:47,644 --> 00:02:52,904
So each of these the genomic
sequencer, wearable devices and

42
00:02:52,904 --> 00:02:57,294
patient reported outcomes, each
with unique format and standards.

43
00:02:57,924 --> 00:03:01,744
And there is also the unstructured
clinical information, which is up

44
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:06,124
to 80% of the clinical relevant
information, which is existing, the

45
00:03:06,124 --> 00:03:10,544
unstructured format, which has to be
bring it to the structured format.

46
00:03:10,994 --> 00:03:14,474
Using some natural language
processing to extract the data

47
00:03:14,974 --> 00:03:16,799
and the system fragmentation.

48
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:22,819
A single hospital typically manages
over 50 disposable clinical information

49
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:27,559
systems, each with unique data
models and exchange prototypes

50
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:31,759
that must be reconciled to create
unified patient representation,

51
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:33,879
data quality and governance.

52
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:38,219
So there is a certain process we follow
for the data quality and the governance.

53
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,529
Initially is to start with the lineage
tracking and the master data management,

54
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,899
standardization and validation.

55
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:48,649
So these are the four steps
which are involved in the data

56
00:03:48,649 --> 00:03:49,879
quality and the governance.

57
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:54,724
And this will definitely improve
efficiency of personalized medicine, reli

58
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:57,739
fundamentally on pristine data quality.

59
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,919
Advanced analytics infrastructure,
so the high performance computing,

60
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:08,319
stream processing, lops pipelines,
interactive visualization.

61
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:13,609
So these are the four standards
that that improves the technology,

62
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:16,369
which I have been used in the
advanced analytics infrastructure.

63
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:21,649
So supporting the analytical requirement
of personalized medicine requires a

64
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:24,289
sophisticated and computational resources.

65
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:27,709
Tailored to the unique characteristics
of the healthcare data.

66
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:35,759
Genomic analytic workflow for clinical
applications typically requires 122 240

67
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,729
CPU hours per patient for comprehensive,
varied analysis and interruption.

68
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:45,979
Data engineering technologies
have demonstrated a significant

69
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:49,639
quantitative impacts across various
aspects of healthcare delivery.

70
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:54,799
So the natural language processing
system now achieve over 90%

71
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:59,739
accuracy in extracting the clinical
concepts for narrative text.

72
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:05,639
While implementing data province
frameworks reduces errors by 35%, so

73
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:11,489
FHIR based data models, which improves
the query performance an average of 50%

74
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:14,759
compared by traditional relational models.

75
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:21,900
So a well-designed clinical visualization
that reduces decision time by 25%, and

76
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,729
also that agnostic accuracy by 20%.

77
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:26,779
How the genomic medicine is transforming.

78
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:30,829
So first, the rapid sequencing
and then the efficient storage,

79
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:34,939
and then the automated interation
and population integration.

80
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:39,449
So these are the four topics how the
genomic medicine is transforming which

81
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:41,460
is available in the current situation.

82
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:45,519
So the rapid sequencing, which
which, the sequence now completed

83
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,319
in halon instead of weeks.

84
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:51,519
And this enables critical genetic
diagnosis for critical ill

85
00:05:51,549 --> 00:05:56,109
newborn and immediate intervention
and the efficient storage.

86
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:02,029
So we have the efficient devices where we
can store that data in the current systems

87
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,369
and also the automated interpretation.

88
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:08,809
There are sophisticated vari annotation
pipelines, integration filters.

89
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:13,809
Millions of genetic variations down
to 20 to 25 clinical significant

90
00:06:14,769 --> 00:06:17,169
S for targeted treatment planning.

91
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:22,379
So data engineering team at leading
academic medicine center have a

92
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,749
revolutionized genomic by developing
efficient processing pipelines

93
00:06:28,109 --> 00:06:32,689
that analyze complete genomics,
unpredictable diagnostic evaluation.

94
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:38,269
So the early warning system predict
clinical ation five to two hours

95
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:44,209
before traditional sign, and then
multidi multimodal integration.

96
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:49,099
This process, 250 to 400
variable per patient, including

97
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:50,509
continuous waveform data.

98
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:58,219
Advanced analytics apply time series
analytics to identify sub pattern

99
00:06:58,219 --> 00:06:59,899
predictor of disease progression.

100
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,909
Continuous learning.

101
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:07,700
This automated ation workflow incorporate
new data to ma maintain model accuracy.

102
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:15,689
So pioneering the healthcare system are
harnessing sophisticated data engineering

103
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:21,840
to deploy early warning systems that
detect clinical hovers before every.

104
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,880
Patient profile that captures
psychological status according to multiple

105
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,400
patterns which unprotected precision.

106
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:34,490
So these are the four sub basis where
we identify the disease and then we take

107
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,970
certain actions to protect the patient.

108
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,550
And this shows the clinical
impact of our data engineer.

109
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:44,225
What are the metrics and what is
the traditional approach and also

110
00:07:44,225 --> 00:07:45,665
the data engineering approach.

111
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,285
The diagnostic time has reduced.

112
00:07:48,785 --> 00:07:51,025
Of pretty much on a huge number.

113
00:07:51,445 --> 00:07:54,805
So before the diagnostic time used
to take a lot of time, and now

114
00:07:54,805 --> 00:07:59,515
the time has come down by 43 and
the treatment selection physician.

115
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:05,155
Based on the data analytics, they can
decide how this patient has to be treated.

116
00:08:05,215 --> 00:08:09,905
And this information will help the
doctor to take 60% more precise.

117
00:08:09,985 --> 00:08:14,185
A faster way to treat the selection
precision and the time taken to

118
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:16,405
diagnostic for critical cases.

119
00:08:16,555 --> 00:08:22,995
So normally it takes around 16 days to
take the necessary steps for diagnostic

120
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:27,585
of the critical cases, but now it takes
only two to six hours to take a decision.

121
00:08:28,445 --> 00:08:30,095
And the whole genomic analysis.

122
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:32,165
This used to take around
two to three days.

123
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:38,255
Right now it's taking around eight hours
and the variant review efficiency, so

124
00:08:38,255 --> 00:08:42,395
there are millions of variants before
and now as of now in the market, it's

125
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:48,785
30 to 50 s. The treatment outcome
prediction before that additional

126
00:08:48,785 --> 00:08:53,345
push was to see it as a baseline, but
right now that is 30% more accurate.

127
00:08:53,845 --> 00:08:56,485
And in-hospital mortality is a baseline.

128
00:08:57,145 --> 00:08:59,545
And that has reduced by 23%.

129
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:02,595
So right now what are the
challenges in healthcare?

130
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:03,525
Data engineering.

131
00:09:04,035 --> 00:09:07,325
So there are certain ethical
implementations and which which

132
00:09:07,325 --> 00:09:12,635
also includes to designs, the edge
computing, the privacy protection,

133
00:09:13,175 --> 00:09:14,465
and exponential data growth.

134
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,760
So these are the five steps which
we might cross across in dealing

135
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,520
with the future challenges in
the healthcare data engineering.

136
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:29,440
And that will definitely help healthcare
data to, to grow at approximately 36%

137
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,535
annually, significantly outpatient
storage capacity, expenses.

138
00:09:34,035 --> 00:09:39,225
And also the future of healthcare delivery
risks firmly on the shoulders of robust

139
00:09:39,285 --> 00:09:44,475
data engineering by building the technical
infrastructure that enables personalized

140
00:09:44,475 --> 00:09:46,455
medicine and advanced diagnosis.

141
00:09:46,905 --> 00:09:50,595
Data engineering are not merely
supporting healthcare, but

142
00:09:50,595 --> 00:09:52,065
fundamentally transforming it.

143
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:57,875
So the solutions for data integration,
quality management, analytics, and

144
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,300
ethical implementation creates cycles.

145
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:06,185
Where increased information,
accessibility drives improved clinical

146
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:10,295
outcomes, so generating more data
to further refine predictive models.

147
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:14,795
As personalized medicine initiated
expands beyond academic centers to

148
00:10:14,795 --> 00:10:20,750
community settings, the role of data
engineering will become increasingly

149
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,330
central to healthcare evaluations.

150
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:27,220
Thank you very much for taking
time to attend this session.

151
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,760
Again, this session is again about the
data engineering and transforming the

152
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,490
healthcare, so you have a wonderful day.

153
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:33,970
Thank you.
