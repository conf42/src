1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,479
Welcome all for conference 42,
prompt Engineering, 2025 online.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,959
I'm Swami Viro, working Vice President
of Intelligence and Mission Learning

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:20,689
at JP Morgan and Co, where I led in the
intersection of advanced AI technology and

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,330
financial systems with deep automation.

5
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,290
I am dedicated to modernizing investment
banking process, driving innovation,

6
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,080
and ensuring data driven mission making.

7
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:40,885
Today I'll be speaking about transf
role of VE augmented generation

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,760
agents in finance, and how
intelligent prompt automation is.

9
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,550
By streamlining workflows,
enhancing data quality, and

10
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,399
enabling smarter, faster operations.

11
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,379
Let us discuss about
critical infection points.

12
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,509
So like mainly we have
three infection points.

13
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:08,279
One, data fellows and manual
process and real time risks.

14
00:01:08,779 --> 00:01:11,629
Let us dive deep into these three things.

15
00:01:12,349 --> 00:01:18,379
The financial services industry faces
unprecedented challenges in maintaining

16
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:25,669
data consistency, regulatory complaints,
and operational efficiency across

17
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:26,719
increasingly fragmented systems.

18
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:32,739
Traditional data management approaches
can no longer sustain the velocity,

19
00:01:32,889 --> 00:01:36,489
volume, and complexity of modern markets.

20
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:42,419
The IM of retrieval Augmenting
generation system combined with MultiGen

21
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:48,499
architectures represents a fundamental
shift in how financial institution

22
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:51,349
process information make decisions.

23
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:57,880
These systems demonstrate measurably
improvement across critical

24
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:04,090
operational dimensions while addressing
core challenges that help plant

25
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,400
investment banking for decades.

26
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:11,519
Okay, now let us talk about
the data consistency crisis.

27
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:14,390
So today, like we know.

28
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:22,640
10 million plus daily transactions,
70 and hundred plans and continuous

29
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,945
operation of system 24 by seven.

30
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:32,894
Investment banking operations sell evolved
into extraordinarily complex ecosystem

31
00:02:33,464 --> 00:02:38,984
where data flows through numerous
systems, platforms, and jurisdictions.

32
00:02:39,644 --> 00:02:44,465
Simultaneously, major investment
banks process tens of millions

33
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:50,315
of transactions daily with peak
periods reaching exponential higher

34
00:02:50,315 --> 00:02:52,565
volumes during market volatility.

35
00:02:53,065 --> 00:02:57,505
Take daily transactions processed across
multiple systems, requiring perfect

36
00:02:57,565 --> 00:03:04,454
consistency, integration points between
front, middle, and back office platforms.

37
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:10,685
We need perfect integration,
continuous operations, global markets

38
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,780
demand around the clock process.

39
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,880
Each transaction generates multiple
data points that must remain consistent

40
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:24,920
across front office trading systems,
middle office risk platforms, and

41
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,109
back office settlement infrastructure.

42
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:31,150
Traditional batch processing
introduces latency.

43
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:38,290
That creates windows of inconsistency
while real time interaction attempts

44
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,650
struggle with computational demands.

45
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:47,454
Okay, now let us start, like in
existing system, what are the

46
00:03:47,454 --> 00:03:50,015
complications with human cost?

47
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:52,015
So mainly with the.

48
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:57,434
Mainly data quality issues,
manual reconciliation process,

49
00:03:57,584 --> 00:03:59,414
and regulatory requirements.

50
00:04:00,404 --> 00:04:05,714
That is dive deep data quality issues,
combine integration challenges,

51
00:04:06,215 --> 00:04:11,405
information originates from driver
sources, live internal trading

52
00:04:11,405 --> 00:04:17,315
systems, external market data vendors,
regulatory reporting platforms,

53
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,295
and counterparty communications.

54
00:04:20,045 --> 00:04:24,905
Each with different formats, update
frequencies and quality standards.

55
00:04:25,405 --> 00:04:29,875
Highly scale provisionals spend
significant time identifying

56
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:35,605
discrepancies, researching root
causes, and implementing corrections.

57
00:04:36,535 --> 00:04:41,280
What that adds limited strategy
value, but remains essential

58
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,960
for operational integrity.

59
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:49,039
Manual reconciliation process cannot
scale to vinyl modern transaction volumes

60
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,249
while maintaining competitive speed.

61
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:58,149
Even small discrepancies cascaded
into significant problem when

62
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:01,329
undetected across multiple systems.

63
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:07,229
Regulatory requirements are another
layer demanding detail, audit trails,

64
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:12,119
data lineage, proof, and complaints
across multiple jurisdictions.

65
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:17,289
Okay, now let's discuss about what
is the architectural foundational

66
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:21,489
and how multi-agent system works.

67
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,130
In this diagram.

68
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:29,900
So query means like any trade, maybe
it is in the different formats and it

69
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:37,400
interacts with lm and before interacting
LM it going to get its context from

70
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,909
Vector database and after that and going
to work with different agents there.

71
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:48,489
State processing agent
risk assessment, compliance

72
00:05:48,489 --> 00:05:50,859
monitoring, or settlement de can.

73
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:53,369
So let us dive deep.

74
00:05:53,869 --> 00:05:58,969
So in framework, enhance language
model capabilities by connecting

75
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:04,424
them into authority to data sources
rather than relaying solely and

76
00:06:04,744 --> 00:06:05,824
embedded training knowledge.

77
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:11,334
When process inquiries about trade
settlement status, the system reduces

78
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:16,374
relevant information from transaction
databases, settlement platforms,

79
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:21,684
and counterparty communications
before generating responses.

80
00:06:22,184 --> 00:06:26,539
This approach ensures
accuracy, provides a trails.

81
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:32,069
And allow system to work
with up to date information.

82
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:34,829
Extending beyond model training data.

83
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:41,869
Multi-agent architecture, intelligent
distributes across specialized components

84
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,719
rather than monolithic systems.

85
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:50,979
Individual agents focus on
specific domains, trade processing.

86
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:54,449
Monitoring or settlement reconciliation.

87
00:06:54,949 --> 00:07:00,349
Developing the expertise while
coordinating to solve complex problems.

88
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:05,739
Agent coordination protocol enables
sophisticated workflows through well

89
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:10,929
defined interfaces that maintain
modularity while handling complex

90
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:13,969
negotiations and optimizations.

91
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:19,644
So all with the LMEs, like after that.

92
00:07:20,104 --> 00:07:24,884
So it's gonna mainly focus on
semantic search and vector databases.

93
00:07:25,384 --> 00:07:31,254
So in this like in semantic search
and vector database, we mainly

94
00:07:31,254 --> 00:07:35,454
have this components like document,
organization, vector emits.

95
00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:38,764
Seman and contextual understanding.

96
00:07:39,264 --> 00:07:45,084
So for this document, organization,
regulatory frameworks, trading policies,

97
00:07:45,084 --> 00:07:52,089
market data, and historical transaction,
organized for such while reserving

98
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:55,149
relationships second vector embeddings.

99
00:07:55,904 --> 00:08:02,384
Content transformed into mathematical
representation that captures semantic

100
00:08:02,384 --> 00:08:08,304
meaning and context semantic criteria,
contextual relevant information

101
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:11,754
even without exact keyword matches.

102
00:08:12,254 --> 00:08:16,964
Finally, contextual understanding
system handles financial

103
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:19,439
terminology, variations across.

104
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:22,099
Causes and time periods.

105
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:27,399
This semantic understanding was
crucial when dealing with financial

106
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:31,929
technology that varies significantly
across different contexts.

107
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:36,509
Enabling the system to find
relevant information regardless

108
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:38,114
of how queries are phrased.

109
00:08:38,614 --> 00:08:42,694
Okay, now let's talk about the
microservice architecture of lys.

110
00:08:43,684 --> 00:08:50,434
So we use microservice architecture
everywhere, but it is pretty much similar.

111
00:08:50,434 --> 00:08:55,149
What we use some orchestration
like a p, a gateway and different

112
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:58,789
A components interactive here.

113
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:03,819
So mainly the microservice architecture
supporting AA capabilities provide

114
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:09,339
the scalability, reliability, and
flexibility demanded by production,

115
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:15,119
financial systems, individual services,
and specific functions, and scale

116
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:21,909
independently based on demand, independent
scaling services, scale based on demand.

117
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:27,869
Massive transaction volumes during
peak period while maintaining

118
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:34,309
cost efficiency during normal
operations system resilience.

119
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:40,069
Service isolation ensures
issues in one component do not

120
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:42,829
cascade into systemwide failure.

121
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:44,964
Next, security by design.

122
00:09:45,464 --> 00:09:50,984
Access control logging built the
foundation with comprehensive.

123
00:09:51,484 --> 00:09:54,339
Okay, so next important topic is.

124
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,564
So like we have data engineering.

125
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,974
So first one, data source.

126
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:03,334
Like for every brand, we need data source.

127
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:07,864
Here in this investment banking, we
use market data, internal reports,

128
00:10:07,864 --> 00:10:13,704
or regulatory documents, and we can
use this as a context and prompt

129
00:10:13,704 --> 00:10:18,384
prepares the templates and intent
classification and prompt optimization.

130
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:22,784
So every year, lamp just need this prompt.

131
00:10:23,284 --> 00:10:29,395
Process the engineering prompts and
gives the output in different format,

132
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:36,035
automated compliance, monitoring,
recommendation, and customer reports.

133
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,814
So what are the core
benefits with this brand?

134
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:42,089
Engineering, mainly enhanced accuracy.

135
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:47,829
Engineered prompts reduce hallucination
and ensure domain specification.

136
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:53,539
Second, decision making data
interpretation and report

137
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:58,669
generation Third, regulatory
consistency, embeds complaints,

138
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:01,059
both operational efficiency.

139
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:06,949
Three professionals high value
to us with scalable intelligence

140
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:14,079
exchange, AI insights across this
and client operational securely.

141
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:20,459
Okay, now let us see how the realtime
trade process works in the ai.

142
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,109
Okay.

143
00:11:21,609 --> 00:11:26,159
So from execution to
settlement in milliseconds.

144
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:32,069
So we know that like in the current
world, like so based on the trade

145
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:37,649
type, it may take three plus one, or
three plus three or three plus seven

146
00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:42,094
or three plus 15, or even sometimes
it goes to plus 30 to settle.

147
00:11:42,594 --> 00:11:46,574
So in that way now it is
reducing to millisecond.

148
00:11:47,324 --> 00:11:51,164
So it's a data achievement
actually, when you trade executes

149
00:11:51,164 --> 00:11:52,814
a complex structured product.

150
00:11:53,534 --> 00:11:58,514
Intelligent agents automate
workflows that previously required

151
00:11:58,964 --> 00:12:01,184
extensive manual intervention.

152
00:12:01,684 --> 00:12:04,319
The system immediately
validates state economics.

153
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:08,899
Checks, credit limits,
regulatory complaints, and

154
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:10,849
in shared settlement process.

155
00:12:10,849 --> 00:12:13,459
All within milliseconds
of trade execution.

156
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:14,889
Trade execution.

157
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:22,114
Structured product is executed by trader
and instant validation, close economics,

158
00:12:22,114 --> 00:12:26,374
credit limits, and complaints Verified.

159
00:12:26,874 --> 00:12:30,374
Finally, auto settlement
process initiated automatically.

160
00:12:30,874 --> 00:12:35,914
Realtime reconciliation performs
continuous comparation of trade details

161
00:12:35,974 --> 00:12:42,304
across systems, immediately flagging
discrepancies for investigation.

162
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:48,954
This immediate detection prevents small
issues from combining into larger problems

163
00:12:49,044 --> 00:12:54,594
and dramatically reduces the operational
burden of reconciliation teams.

164
00:12:55,094 --> 00:12:59,399
Okay, now let us discuss about
intelligent reconciliation.

165
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:01,459
So in Reconci

166
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:07,929
we mainly talk about the traditional
approach and a based approach.

167
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:11,519
There is a lag to load this presentation.

168
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:12,919
So mainly

169
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:18,534
batch crossing overnight in the
traditional approach and also,

170
00:13:19,394 --> 00:13:25,369
undetected discrepancies, numerous
false positive from format variations,

171
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:31,129
manual investigations of every PLA
and delayed problem resolution.

172
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:34,579
So all these things happen
with the traditional approach.

173
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:38,579
So with the a enhanced approach,

174
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:43,429
we can achieve continuous severe
time reconciliation, India

175
00:13:43,619 --> 00:13:47,839
discrepancy detection, contextual
understanding of equivalence.

176
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:55,704
Of false and prevention, so Amm
system understands contextual,

177
00:13:56,204 --> 00:14:01,004
recognizing that various property
names, settlement dates adjusted

178
00:14:01,004 --> 00:14:06,494
for already are minor price
differences within tolerance for sure.

179
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:10,049
Don't represent two discrepancies.

180
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:15,559
This intelligent reduces false
positives substantially allowing

181
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:21,349
reconciliation teams to focus on
genuine issues requiring investigation.

182
00:14:21,849 --> 00:14:24,849
Okay, what are the
advanced risk assessments?

183
00:14:25,349 --> 00:14:30,289
Okay, advanced risk assessment,
like mainly we're categorized into

184
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:36,499
historical analysis position, Mandarin
correlation detection and emerging risks.

185
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:37,449
Okay.

186
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:44,649
Risk assessment capabilities, benefit
and LY from a system that rails and

187
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:50,979
across vast amounts of historical data,
current position, and market conditions.

188
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:58,579
Risk manage systems that apply
Redfin to current positions, AI

189
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:04,969
and systems, identifying emerging
patterns, correlations across seemingly

190
00:15:04,969 --> 00:15:11,209
unrelated positions and potential
risks that don't fit standard models.

191
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:14,019
Okay, next, historical analysis.

192
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,949
Across of market data.

193
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:23,539
Second position wondering realtime
exposure assessment across portfolios,

194
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:29,999
relation detection, identifying hidden
relationship between positions, emerging

195
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:32,954
risk, identification of non debt.

196
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:38,374
The system continuously monitors
market conditions, analyzes historical

197
00:15:38,874 --> 00:15:46,104
and assist portfolio exposure across
multiple risks dimensions, simultaneously

198
00:15:46,604 --> 00:15:52,154
enabling more aggressive risk taking
within appropriately limits, while

199
00:15:52,154 --> 00:15:54,499
maintaining prudent risk management.

200
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:56,709
Where do complaints monitoring?

201
00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:04,999
Okay, here we have four different ways
of complex monitoring, one regulatory

202
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:10,164
tracking, pattern analysis, impact
assessment, and proactive prevention.

203
00:16:10,664 --> 00:16:17,794
Complaints monitor, react to risk
management rather than simply flagging

204
00:16:18,064 --> 00:16:20,824
transaction that violates explicit rules.

205
00:16:21,784 --> 00:16:27,664
A systems identifi patterns that
suggest potential complaints

206
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:30,004
issues before violations occur.

207
00:16:30,504 --> 00:16:31,224
Regulatory tracking.

208
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:36,034
Monitoring of regular changes
across jurisdiction, pattern

209
00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:41,194
analysis, identifying behaviors
that suggest potential issues,

210
00:16:41,694 --> 00:16:47,814
impact assessment, evaluating how
changes affect current strategies.

211
00:16:48,314 --> 00:16:53,264
Prior to prevention addressing
issues before they became violations.

212
00:16:53,954 --> 00:16:57,194
The system understands
regulatory requirements

213
00:16:57,194 --> 00:16:59,174
across multiple jurisdictions.

214
00:16:59,674 --> 00:17:05,194
Facts changes, and assesses how
those changes impact current

215
00:17:05,404 --> 00:17:07,499
creating strategies and positions.

216
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:12,919
This proactive approach allows
compliance teams to orders potential

217
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:19,419
issues before they become violations
significantly reducing regulatory risk.

218
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,474
Okay, now let us talk
about performance at scale.

219
00:17:22,974 --> 00:17:28,554
So production system characteristics
are like transactions per second

220
00:17:29,004 --> 00:17:33,474
peak processing capacity during
market volatility should be like

221
00:17:33,504 --> 00:17:38,094
1 million plus transactions per
second, and system availability.

222
00:17:38,154 --> 00:17:40,919
Finance up time with automated failover.

223
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:46,569
Is subsequent performance for
interactive operations, the microservice

224
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:52,599
architectural individual components
to scale independently directing

225
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:58,679
resources to bottlenecks services during
peak periods while maintaining cost

226
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,694
efficiency during normal operations.

227
00:18:01,194 --> 00:18:07,724
A. Continuous health monitoring ensures
finance availability that financial

228
00:18:07,724 --> 00:18:13,534
operations demand trade validations
occur within milliseconds of execution.

229
00:18:14,034 --> 00:18:19,554
This calculation complete quickly after
support real time position, monitoring

230
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:25,404
compliance, checks operated, trading
speed without becoming bottlenecks.

231
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:30,224
These aggress seal latency
requirements demand careful

232
00:18:30,434 --> 00:18:33,494
optimization of every system component.

233
00:18:33,994 --> 00:18:38,494
Okay, let us talk about security
and compliance implementations.

234
00:18:39,154 --> 00:18:44,614
We have mainly six topics here, like
data protection, explainability,

235
00:18:45,579 --> 00:18:48,669
access control, model validation.

236
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:55,809
Logging incident response data
protection number one, comprehensive

237
00:18:55,809 --> 00:19:01,059
encryption covering data
addressed in transit and in use.

238
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:07,949
Sensitive financial information, protected
external threats and unauthorized internal

239
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:13,474
access control pipeline permissions with
role based and tribute based controls.

240
00:19:13,974 --> 00:19:18,654
Dynamic authorization conditions
based on context and risk level

241
00:19:19,154 --> 00:19:24,634
audit logging, comprehensive trail
captures every system interaction.

242
00:19:25,474 --> 00:19:29,224
Secure logging infrastructure
prevents tampering with audit

243
00:19:29,224 --> 00:19:31,829
regards, explainability.

244
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:39,259
Here rationally for every a edition
that human reviewers can understand and

245
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:46,139
validates transparent edition making
at mission speed model validation.

246
00:19:46,639 --> 00:19:52,069
Ongoing monitoring ensures a
components continue operating

247
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:53,994
correctly as markets evolve.

248
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:56,594
Maintain system effectiveness.

249
00:19:57,094 --> 00:20:04,464
Finally, in general response, detection
of ous behavior, automated containment

250
00:20:04,644 --> 00:20:08,369
and response to prevent escalation.

251
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:11,624
Okay, now let's talk about
miserable business impact.

252
00:20:12,124 --> 00:20:17,524
Here we will talk about four different
things like cost reduction, efficiency

253
00:20:17,524 --> 00:20:21,454
gains, and error, and steady flexibility.

254
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:27,499
Cost reduction, automation reduces
manual effort for road in operations.

255
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:33,009
Annual growing transaction volumes
without proportional staff increases

256
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:37,399
efficiency gains complete in minutes.

257
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:38,869
In short of hours.

258
00:20:39,369 --> 00:20:41,739
Faster confirmation and settlement.

259
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:45,714
Improve client service and
comp to advantage error.

260
00:20:46,214 --> 00:20:51,524
Pure operational errors means less
correction time, reduce settlement

261
00:20:51,524 --> 00:20:54,724
failures, and improve regular standing.

262
00:20:55,224 --> 00:21:03,074
Next, strategic flexibility content to
portion new opportunities and new markets

263
00:21:03,704 --> 00:21:08,909
and launches products with operational
infrastructure that supports growth.

264
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:13,519
Financial institutions implementing
these technologies report

265
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,189
substantial operational improvements.

266
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:21,859
The efficiency gains allows handling
of growing transactional volume,

267
00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:28,749
minimal managing cost, transforming the
economics of expansion, and enabling

268
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:34,324
opportunities that would be economically
unviable with traditional approaches.

269
00:21:34,824 --> 00:21:36,384
What is the path forward?

270
00:21:36,884 --> 00:21:40,874
So fundamental transformation
of financial operations.

271
00:21:41,374 --> 00:21:47,244
Rad, enhance multi agent A.
Systems are funda, transforming

272
00:21:47,334 --> 00:21:49,074
investment banking operations.

273
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:55,334
This goes beyond automation enabling
system that handle complexity.

274
00:21:55,834 --> 00:21:58,779
And speed The traditional approaches.

275
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:06,079
Current state miserable through cost
reduction, efficiency and risk management.

276
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:12,969
Near firm evaluation, cost
implementation, reduce risk, and

277
00:22:12,969 --> 00:22:16,839
expected capabilities, future potential.

278
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:22,889
Autonomous operations advance
reasoning and risk prevention.

279
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:29,789
As a becomes essential financial
institution must prioritize systematic.

280
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:35,809
A adoption organizations committed
to this transformation will thrive

281
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:43,359
in increasingly competitive and
technologically sophisticated industry.
