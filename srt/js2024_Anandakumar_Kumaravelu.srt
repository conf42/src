1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,730
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:04,790
welcome to the con 42
JavaScript 2024 conference.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,440
And my name is Ananda Kumar Abellu.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,770
And I am a cloud consultant and
an AI ML consultant at a company

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:17,850
named Sara System, who's a premium
cloud partner with Google Cloud.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,680
We closely work with the Google
Cloud team, and I'm one of the

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,589
consultant work for the company.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,025
So today's topic is what I'm going
to talk about is The impact of

9
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:35,115
machine learning on promotional
strategies, which is like a study of,

10
00:00:35,215 --> 00:00:37,755
AI powered coupon personalization.

11
00:00:38,115 --> 00:00:41,135
so I'm quickly, let's get into the topic.

12
00:00:41,405 --> 00:00:44,345
let me start with the, with what
I'm going to talk about today.

13
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:49,125
So one is the introduction to AI
powered coupon personalization.

14
00:00:49,445 --> 00:00:55,855
So when I say coupons, it is just that,
You know when you go to any store, they

15
00:00:56,185 --> 00:01:02,245
give you some special discounts for a
product or anything that you buy comes

16
00:01:02,245 --> 00:01:08,765
with an additional discounts so It can be
either you're going to a particular store

17
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:13,800
or it can be from an e commerce site or
anything that you buy, the discount, that

18
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,900
you get, for that particular product.

19
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:22,520
So AI powered coupon is how the
AI decides, how much discounts

20
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,450
or anything that can be given,
To a personalized person.

21
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,110
Now the coupon is not for everyone,
you know the coupon when I talk about

22
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,720
is just all in general that we have
but how that particular person or that

23
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,800
individual who's going to buy would get
a discount for that particular product

24
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,320
or whatever he is going to purchase.

25
00:01:42,805 --> 00:01:47,035
the next thing is what is the fundamental
about the AI powered personalization?

26
00:01:47,045 --> 00:01:52,515
Why AI is powering that, how or how it is
going to identify that particular person

27
00:01:52,535 --> 00:01:57,615
and only for that particular person AI is
suggesting for, a coupon or a discount.

28
00:01:58,025 --> 00:02:01,885
So how these, personalized coupons
are and offers are created.

29
00:02:02,235 --> 00:02:04,225
the fourth one would
be what is the benefit?

30
00:02:04,235 --> 00:02:07,515
Why are we doing, this AI
powered coupon personalizations?

31
00:02:07,965 --> 00:02:12,295
And the real world case studies, there
are some companies still follow that

32
00:02:12,305 --> 00:02:17,105
and they have been very successful
doing this, coupon personalizations and

33
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:20,535
i'm going to talk about that and the
next thing is what are the challenges

34
00:02:20,545 --> 00:02:24,950
and ethical considerations that while
doing this doing this and what are

35
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:30,270
the challenges that we come up, from
a security, from a data ethicalness,

36
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,190
from data governance, I'm going to talk
about some of the challenges, of that,

37
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,840
and some key performance indicators
when you are doing something, it's

38
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,530
obviously you have to calculate the cost.

39
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,790
KPIs and how we measure that this
particular ai, coupon, personalized

40
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,000
is working for that particular
company and as well as for the

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,590
customer who is buying that.

42
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,000
And that, the, and, and also
where are we heading, what is the

43
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,630
future direction for the ai, AI
on these promotional strategies?

44
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,300
And I'm gonna, conclude with some of the
points, why I have been, Consulting or,

45
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,040
consulting this, coupon personalization
for, big enterprise companies as well.

46
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:09,590
thank you.

47
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,310
And, let's, quickly
get into the, contents.

48
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,740
So first thing, introduction
to the AI personal coupons.

49
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,850
So let me tell you, gimme a small stories.

50
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:24,110
You remember, like I go to a store
example, like a Walmart or a Kroger or,

51
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,670
the nearby federal market, anywhere.

52
00:03:27,015 --> 00:03:29,815
when you enter the store,
there is always a bit of paper.

53
00:03:30,055 --> 00:03:34,175
Where do you see there are, when you
pick out, you pick two pineapples, that

54
00:03:34,185 --> 00:03:36,435
there will be a third pineapple for free.

55
00:03:36,665 --> 00:03:41,895
you will have a very generalized
way on the new, like a newspaper.

56
00:03:42,075 --> 00:03:44,475
if you buy one kg's of oranges.

57
00:03:44,665 --> 00:03:48,495
there will be another, kg of
oranges for the half the price.

58
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:51,935
and some, sometimes like you buy
two shirts, you get the third

59
00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:53,295
shirt for 50 percent discount.

60
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:57,245
you might always think what is
the logical logic behind that.

61
00:03:57,245 --> 00:03:57,330
Yeah.

62
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:57,415
Yeah.

63
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:02,065
Logic Behind it is obviously they wanted
you to buy more, but at that time, most

64
00:04:02,065 --> 00:04:07,205
of the time I have seen that you really,
I don't have the intention to buy a

65
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:11,575
shirt or a pineapple on that particular
day, but the offer is there, right?

66
00:04:12,315 --> 00:04:14,525
But I really don't want
to buy, why would I buy?

67
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:16,189
Because I just bought, a t shirt.

68
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:21,760
a shirt or a pineapple from a day before
and when I go the offer will be there

69
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,330
for the next day and it's always a
disappointment that I have encountered.

70
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,900
I'm sure that you might also
seen that same scenario.

71
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,350
Most of us.

72
00:04:29,475 --> 00:04:30,155
Let's do that.

73
00:04:30,405 --> 00:04:31,075
Oh my God.

74
00:04:31,265 --> 00:04:35,615
I just bought this, but today the
offer is on, on, on, on these today.

75
00:04:36,395 --> 00:04:39,245
it is always the advertisement
is, is being wasted.

76
00:04:39,255 --> 00:04:42,645
Some of the time people buy it,
take user, Oh, I think of doing

77
00:04:42,645 --> 00:04:44,215
it, right now there is an offer.

78
00:04:44,215 --> 00:04:45,535
Let me go and grab that.

79
00:04:45,725 --> 00:04:47,695
But it is not the case for all.

80
00:04:48,145 --> 00:04:50,465
and in a retail.

81
00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:52,865
e commerce site or a retail store.

82
00:04:53,155 --> 00:04:57,305
This is how the traditional,
coupons are, working.

83
00:04:57,535 --> 00:05:03,475
so the, there is no way where whether
this coupons that been advertised, or

84
00:05:03,535 --> 00:05:07,525
sometimes you get a mail as well saying
Hey, you go to the store, this is how,

85
00:05:07,565 --> 00:05:09,195
you buy this, there is a discount.

86
00:05:09,405 --> 00:05:11,691
But at that particular time, at a
certain point of time, you don't

87
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:15,451
need that product or you might
have that product already in store.

88
00:05:15,741 --> 00:05:20,221
But when you want to go and buy, it's
always the discount is not available

89
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:21,881
at the time that you decide to buy.

90
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:23,911
I hope that makes sense.

91
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,021
So what, what we are trying to
do is we are introducing the AI

92
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:30,051
in this coupon personalization.

93
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:36,741
And, I'm trying to see how this is,
this helps in this, personalizations.

94
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:43,621
How, how, better this whole strategy
of giving discounts can work.

95
00:05:43,771 --> 00:05:44,031
Okay.

96
00:05:44,331 --> 00:05:47,921
Obviously, AI is being, AI and
machine learning is top in the market.

97
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:52,151
it is being used, widely
used in every industry.

98
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:56,321
even I have created myself an AI
bot, which it, which I talk to him.

99
00:05:56,441 --> 00:06:00,496
You can ask me who me, for
every person, AI is big.

100
00:06:00,646 --> 00:06:05,046
Right now being a part of our,
ecosystem right now, in our daily life.

101
00:06:05,296 --> 00:06:09,396
this is again a revolution like how
we cannot avoid phones right now.

102
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:14,366
So AI is the next move where, we are
going to use the phone for, like phones,

103
00:06:14,426 --> 00:06:16,926
AI will be a part of our, everyday life.

104
00:06:17,326 --> 00:06:20,336
as I explained, the role
of AI in everywhere.

105
00:06:20,566 --> 00:06:22,376
The second, the personalization matters.

106
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:26,776
I already told you the traditional
way of marketing methods, why this

107
00:06:26,776 --> 00:06:30,466
matters because I, I wanted to, I
really wanted a discount, but at that

108
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:31,886
time the discount is not available.

109
00:06:32,196 --> 00:06:35,516
Rather, whenever I wanted,
the discount is not available.

110
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:40,411
Whenever I, whenever I don't wanted
it, the discount is available.

111
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:44,491
As you see that this is an e commerce
market, it is rapidly growing.

112
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:48,991
it will reach definitely by end of this
year is a 6 trillion market by 2024.

113
00:06:49,331 --> 00:06:53,661
And how these AI can get in,
AI powered coupon strategies

114
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:54,896
can really make a difference.

115
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:59,686
differentiation in this e commerce and the
retail stores, in this current, economy.

116
00:06:59,976 --> 00:07:02,106
So that is what this is all about.

117
00:07:02,146 --> 00:07:05,556
So the key concept, AI
personalization uses customer data.

118
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:06,786
Pretty simple.

119
00:07:06,786 --> 00:07:10,756
I'm getting the data from, a timely
ma matter from, from a person.

120
00:07:10,756 --> 00:07:13,816
Say for example, I'm using my
credit card, I'm getting, I'm

121
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:15,346
going to the same store every time.

122
00:07:15,526 --> 00:07:21,226
So it is just like trying to understand
the purchase history of that person

123
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:23,736
and try to give, the personalization.

124
00:07:24,136 --> 00:07:25,306
so for example.

125
00:07:25,566 --> 00:07:28,566
you remember that is always
I don't drink alcohol.

126
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:31,686
I don't buy beers, or I
don't buy any alcohol stuff.

127
00:07:31,686 --> 00:07:34,436
So when I go, there is a coupon for beer.

128
00:07:34,446 --> 00:07:38,041
Like you buy one beer, there was
another set of beer or alcohol is there.

129
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:39,921
free or there is a discounted price.

130
00:07:40,201 --> 00:07:43,281
I don't want that because I
am a non alcoholic person.

131
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,261
Why do I need that?

132
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:49,301
So try to understand these
kind of criterias based on.

133
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:50,891
for example, I am an apple lover.

134
00:07:50,891 --> 00:07:52,071
I always buy apple.

135
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:57,201
It will be better, from, the, from
January till October by this time.

136
00:07:57,431 --> 00:08:01,821
I have almost like bought, Seven
or seven, eight times apples, like

137
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:03,921
almost every month I'm buying apples.

138
00:08:04,141 --> 00:08:08,161
based on particular this history
Okay, this person likes apples a lot.

139
00:08:08,161 --> 00:08:12,511
So he's been constantly buying
apples So I want that person to

140
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:18,321
have an offer only, only for him
So he buys two pounds of apple.

141
00:08:18,451 --> 00:08:20,241
The third pound is really free for him.

142
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:22,701
So You understand where I'm coming from.

143
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:27,761
It is just personalizing some, for that
person for that particular product.

144
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:29,321
Say it can be biscuits.

145
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:34,381
So based on his, based on his
purchase history, this is one way.

146
00:08:34,631 --> 00:08:39,121
And I'm just going to talk about
many ways how this personalization,

147
00:08:39,171 --> 00:08:40,481
works in the coming slides.

148
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,261
okay, quickly, next one.

149
00:08:43,301 --> 00:08:44,171
What is the fundamental?

150
00:08:44,551 --> 00:08:48,986
What is AI personalization as I just,
told you, it involves the, some of the

151
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:53,996
machine learning algorithms to customize
the market content and promote offer

152
00:08:53,996 --> 00:08:56,726
based on that individual's performance.

153
00:08:56,906 --> 00:09:00,586
Say what I conclude is
based on my health history.

154
00:09:00,586 --> 00:09:05,466
One is health history, my
purchase history, my age, my, my.

155
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:07,291
what else?

156
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:11,651
I can say my, based on my search
history in the, in the website, in the

157
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:19,211
internet, based on my family, members,
it can be of any, any kind of scenarios.

158
00:09:19,421 --> 00:09:25,211
The best is the way, is how much or how
we can collect data from that particular

159
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:29,361
persons and know that particular
person, through mul various sources.

160
00:09:29,751 --> 00:09:34,481
So the key components are how the data
is collected through these systems.

161
00:09:34,581 --> 00:09:38,061
as I told you from different
ways, from different sources,

162
00:09:38,801 --> 00:09:40,711
these informations are collected.

163
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:44,841
Then based on that, the
patterns are being analyzed.

164
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:47,921
as I given you an example of apples.

165
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:53,201
So if I buy apples every month,
based on my apple purchases, the

166
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:58,271
coupons, The base, a coupon is
being generated based on my history.

167
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:03,114
So based on my history, I am a,
since I'm not an alcoholic, I

168
00:10:03,114 --> 00:10:08,331
don't buy alcoholic beverages,
I, we don't need that particular

169
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:09,691
coupon for that particular person.

170
00:10:09,981 --> 00:10:14,881
Rather this can be given to a
another person just for who's more

171
00:10:14,891 --> 00:10:16,321
interested based on that person.

172
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:18,521
His purchase history, for example.

173
00:10:19,091 --> 00:10:23,781
So here, there are some of the tools
like how the predictive analytic tools.

174
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:31,641
so say for the last five years, for every
October I am buying something that only

175
00:10:31,641 --> 00:10:36,251
I buy in October, so it just reminds
these, it, it is just a prediction.

176
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:40,991
So it can, the purchase history can
deliver, tell, okay, this person,

177
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:44,721
for the next October he's going to
purchase this, Halloween costume.

178
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:49,311
Okay, or even the during the
Christmas time or maybe my in

179
00:10:49,311 --> 00:10:53,571
October I was born So he's going to
buy a birthday cake every October.

180
00:10:53,811 --> 00:10:57,271
So why don't we just come give
a five dollar or ten dollar?

181
00:10:57,441 --> 00:11:02,021
offer on that particular cake that he's
going to buy So, you know what, it's

182
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,031
just, it just gives the prediction.

183
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:09,421
based on your information that you have
already given, this kind of like just

184
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:13,891
predicts that, predicts, the algorithm
predicts what it would be the preference

185
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:21,201
for that particular person, to issue
a coupon or, So as I just mentioned,

186
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:25,701
some of them are the purchase history,
browsing behaviors, demographic mean,

187
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:27,661
what location he's in, he's into.

188
00:11:27,851 --> 00:11:29,871
I live in a very cold location.

189
00:11:29,961 --> 00:11:32,401
it is right now, it is
45, degree Fahrenheit.

190
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:33,641
So based on that.

191
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:39,816
so it just predicts me, okay, this person
might buy a woolen cloth or something

192
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:44,076
that, that, that just personalized for
that particular, person and contextual

193
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:46,556
data, consider the time of the day.

194
00:11:46,746 --> 00:11:51,326
the device used or the location, say if
I'm just traveling towards, some couple

195
00:11:51,326 --> 00:11:55,146
of, blocks where there is Walmart, it
just gives me a suggestion, hey, there

196
00:11:55,146 --> 00:11:58,551
is a restaurant inside the Walmart that
gives you an offer, if you go and eat

197
00:11:58,561 --> 00:12:03,451
there, obviously if you buy something, in
there, there is a coupon, that is offered,

198
00:12:03,451 --> 00:12:07,541
you get a free snack, in a subway that
is inside Walmart, something like that.

199
00:12:07,606 --> 00:12:12,236
and also it just shows how data flow
through the AI system and created those

200
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:16,676
personal, just a feeling that, say if
you go to a store and, there is already,

201
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:20,116
you wanted to buy something and there
is a coupon that is available for

202
00:12:20,116 --> 00:12:22,666
that particular day, it feels so good.

203
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,866
Okay, it just makes me feel that,
okay, I'm getting from a discounted

204
00:12:25,866 --> 00:12:27,546
price that is not for others.

205
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:28,826
It's just personalized for me.

206
00:12:30,246 --> 00:12:30,416
it?

207
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:34,166
Okay, let's quickly get
into, how this has been done.

208
00:12:34,496 --> 00:12:38,706
so here, I think as I already
mentioned in the previous slide

209
00:12:38,706 --> 00:12:42,896
as well, customer profiling is
more important, than everything.

210
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:47,531
As I told you, the age, demography,
his behavior, Purchasing.

211
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:54,011
so how, what he would, buy, what he
might be, his interest that he might buy.

212
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:58,051
say if, he loves, apple, there
might be a chance he might love

213
00:12:58,051 --> 00:13:00,146
a beer or, piers or grapes.

214
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:03,476
There might be another fruit
that he might be interested.

215
00:13:03,476 --> 00:13:07,676
So based on that, if you keep on
buying apples, why don't, he may have

216
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,591
a tendency to buy oranges as well.

217
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:13,791
So it just gives us, throws a
suggestion on, that, and this all

218
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,891
comes from, the customer profiling.

219
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:17,801
Then comes the predictive modeling.

220
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:23,421
AI analyzes the history of data and, as I
said, forecast, it forecasts which coupon

221
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:26,081
offer will apply for each engagement.

222
00:13:26,331 --> 00:13:30,571
so say if I, if it is a weekend,
the discounts might be different.

223
00:13:30,571 --> 00:13:32,901
And if I'm going on a weekday,
then it is a different.

224
00:13:32,901 --> 00:13:33,441
different.

225
00:13:33,671 --> 00:13:37,481
so this, these kind of things just goes
in, in, it, it called as a predictive,

226
00:13:37,861 --> 00:13:41,521
modeling, it's just based on that
particular date, time and, and the month.

227
00:13:41,991 --> 00:13:45,471
the real time personalization, it
is a dynamic generation based on

228
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:49,071
customers current behavior, such as I
mentioned, is about browsing history,

229
00:13:49,071 --> 00:13:54,121
product category that you might, buy,
and ensuring the timely relevance.

230
00:13:54,151 --> 00:13:55,121
That is more important.

231
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:57,786
And the word timely
relevance is, I don't, buy.

232
00:13:57,786 --> 00:14:02,356
Buy, a log of wood in summer, rather,
a log of wood keys always bought during

233
00:14:02,356 --> 00:14:04,176
the winter, when I'm go for camping.

234
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:07,836
so this is the relevance and the
relevant discounts that can be

235
00:14:07,836 --> 00:14:11,976
offered during, that the, on that,
on the time, based on the time.

236
00:14:12,366 --> 00:14:14,026
So next case study, one of the.

237
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:17,106
Best and the pioneer in using
the personalized coupon.

238
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,636
Coupon coupons are, Amazon.

239
00:14:19,636 --> 00:14:24,256
Amazon has been a great, and they
have literally boosted their sales by

240
00:14:24,256 --> 00:14:26,626
31st through personalized suggestions.

241
00:14:26,896 --> 00:14:31,666
And you can al always use, if you're
using an Amazon app, then you will re

242
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:36,276
realize that, there are some suggestions
which just, really makes you to go

243
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,206
and search for those, search for it.

244
00:14:38,281 --> 00:14:38,676
you might be just.

245
00:14:39,031 --> 00:14:43,681
thinking about it or you might have just
searched somewhere else and automatically

246
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,851
just gives you that particular
suggestions on that particular product.

247
00:14:47,001 --> 00:14:47,951
it's unbelievable.

248
00:14:47,951 --> 00:14:51,011
Like it's all like you might be
thinking, and that, there is a

249
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:54,371
suggestion based on the app would
just show that particular product.

250
00:14:54,701 --> 00:14:59,291
And, and if you're just wondering how I
was just thinking, how come this is there?

251
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:03,106
And, I, this is all done
by, definitely by the AI.

252
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:04,346
Okay.

253
00:15:04,726 --> 00:15:05,836
why are we doing this?

254
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:10,796
What is, what is my benefit in doing,
AI powered coupon personalization?

255
00:15:11,256 --> 00:15:13,136
one is, your, boost.

256
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:19,096
Boost is the, engagement, you are giving,
more, more offers resonate that more

257
00:15:19,096 --> 00:15:24,376
to that particular customer leading in
increase interactions and satisfaction.

258
00:15:24,946 --> 00:15:26,846
pretty much close to the customer.

259
00:15:27,216 --> 00:15:31,096
Basically, you're trying to understand
what customer would want it.

260
00:15:31,476 --> 00:15:34,696
if you, understand the sales, you,
you should know your customer.

261
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,906
You cannot sell something
that customer won't buy.

262
00:15:37,156 --> 00:15:41,741
You have to Put in your shoes when
you sell something, it's a so trying

263
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:45,341
to understand the personage and
it also drives the sales growth

264
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:49,101
so something that you are keep on
buying and which is not sellable.

265
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:53,191
You don't buy that You only wanted to
have something in your store that can sell

266
00:15:53,191 --> 00:15:58,146
easily or we can sell in that particular
in that season or particular time.

267
00:15:58,556 --> 00:16:03,916
So it just gives you, a lift in, in,
in the, in your sales, in your sales.

268
00:16:04,526 --> 00:16:10,046
So it persuasively sees 30 percent and,
another important thing, as I said in

269
00:16:10,046 --> 00:16:14,526
the beginning, those newspapers that
you, when you enter, those are all like,

270
00:16:14,616 --> 00:16:16,676
it's useless, for me, I don't grab it.

271
00:16:16,686 --> 00:16:17,356
Or if somebody is.

272
00:16:17,456 --> 00:16:21,276
Just pointing me, I don't go and
buy that, because I feel always

273
00:16:21,276 --> 00:16:22,686
that, it's not gonna help me.

274
00:16:22,736 --> 00:16:27,006
those coupons are not gonna help me
anyways because, always when I get it, I

275
00:16:27,006 --> 00:16:31,406
have seen that, I wanted something that,
that those products will not be an offer

276
00:16:31,466 --> 00:16:33,056
or, there will be no coupons for that.

277
00:16:34,351 --> 00:16:39,661
by this way, 30 retail stores
on the e commerce site have seen

278
00:16:39,961 --> 00:16:44,531
35, 37 percent is increased in
the redem, redemination rates.

279
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:48,311
So the offers, whatever that been
offered, they have seen that it has been

280
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:51,221
redeemed, redeemed 37 percent increase.

281
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:53,021
So increased retention.

282
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:57,211
Why would I just go to another store
which just gives me a general coupon

283
00:16:57,441 --> 00:17:02,981
rather than I know that this is the store
which gives me more than what I wanted?

284
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,731
I always try to pick that store, right?

285
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,561
That's called personalized experience.

286
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:11,251
it creates a stronger emotional
connection between the customer and

287
00:17:11,251 --> 00:17:13,561
the brand and increase the loyalty.

288
00:17:13,591 --> 00:17:18,101
I don't, I would just buy a same
kind of product, every time if

289
00:17:18,101 --> 00:17:19,641
there is a discount available.

290
00:17:19,921 --> 00:17:22,271
why would I just choose another brand?

291
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:23,191
It's quite obvious.

292
00:17:23,561 --> 00:17:24,611
And cost efficient.

293
00:17:24,671 --> 00:17:28,691
always like you are predicting
that customer is going to buy this

294
00:17:28,691 --> 00:17:32,581
particular product and you can,
you can, you can be very, the store

295
00:17:32,581 --> 00:17:34,581
can be cost effective as well.

296
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:39,366
And it can also, be very efficient for
the customer that he gets, what he wants

297
00:17:40,336 --> 00:17:45,046
what that he wanted to buy for a better
price rather than, rather than a, like

298
00:17:45,046 --> 00:17:46,936
a standard price, from another store.

299
00:17:47,286 --> 00:17:49,666
he knows that he's going to get
discounts when he, whenever he

300
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:50,896
enters that particular store.

301
00:17:51,741 --> 00:17:56,181
better allocation of marketing resources,
reducing promotional spending waste, and

302
00:17:56,181 --> 00:17:58,251
the best part is the ROI improvements.

303
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:01,891
And the study shows that AI
personalization would double the

304
00:18:01,901 --> 00:18:05,131
return of investment, obviously,
in the marketing campaign.

305
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:10,791
So whatever you are, spending on for
marketing and, I, I've never seen that

306
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,241
it is going to really, be in vain.

307
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:16,131
And the last one is the visualization.

308
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:20,411
The bar graph, comparing traditional
with the AI is a key performance

309
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:25,121
matrix, like conversations, rates,
retention, always there is a high

310
00:18:25,131 --> 00:18:26,781
in, in everything that you do.

311
00:18:27,261 --> 00:18:29,851
Okay, moving on to the, next.

312
00:18:30,821 --> 00:18:34,071
Obviously, I told you that
I will be talking about the

313
00:18:34,191 --> 00:18:35,461
real case studies as well.

314
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:41,481
so, The first and my favorite case
study is always the Netflix, because

315
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:45,441
Netflix has been a very great in,
in doing this for a long time.

316
00:18:45,741 --> 00:18:51,351
They've been using, before, AI and, ML
has been very popular in the industry.

317
00:18:51,641 --> 00:18:56,521
have you ever seen, Netflix been
recommending, a pattern of movies that

318
00:18:56,531 --> 00:19:00,691
you always say if you're, if you always
like thriller movies, which I love, it

319
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:04,701
always recommends me like whenever I
turn on, okay, based on your, thriller

320
00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:08,801
movie suggestion, you might also might
like these movies, which just makes me

321
00:19:08,801 --> 00:19:13,901
to either buy or use that particular,
Netflix, channel all the time rather than

322
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:16,991
me going to another, in a real case study.

323
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:21,656
I think, Netflix have become an
estimated 1 million annual savings,

324
00:19:22,186 --> 00:19:28,116
because of just by, giving, these
personalized contents to, to, to customer.

325
00:19:28,576 --> 00:19:32,586
And the second, thing is always, Amazon,
I think, I already spoke about Amazon.

326
00:19:32,826 --> 00:19:36,566
I have never seen anyone, who, I'm
being amazed whenever I use that Amazon.

327
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:37,956
I always use Amazon.

328
00:19:37,956 --> 00:19:40,106
I think I use two apps.

329
00:19:40,106 --> 00:19:41,606
One is Walmart and Amazon.

330
00:19:41,606 --> 00:19:45,366
I can definitely just make out a
difference between Amazon and Walmart

331
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:50,476
because the recommendations and the
discount that, Amazon offers is fantastic.

332
00:19:50,696 --> 00:19:56,536
Fabulous, because they do a lot of
collaboration filtering and deep learning

333
00:19:56,546 --> 00:20:01,706
algorithms and generate and generates
35 percent of the total sale just by

334
00:20:01,716 --> 00:20:03,626
giving those personalized suggestions.

335
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:07,316
And always, whenever I go, there
is a coupon available for me if

336
00:20:07,316 --> 00:20:08,836
I'm just going to buy something.

337
00:20:09,086 --> 00:20:13,306
I don't know how, but, just wondering,
I'm sure that the algorithm is the AI and

338
00:20:13,306 --> 00:20:16,146
ML algorithms or the background of that.

339
00:20:17,031 --> 00:20:21,031
And some of the other examples are,
I'm not going to read everything,

340
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:22,611
Sephora virtual assistant.

341
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:26,351
It just gives you, it's an app
where, it just gives the leads

342
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:29,841
like 50 lookup average sessions,
increasing purchase intent.

343
00:20:29,841 --> 00:20:33,731
It's an online engagement and driving
sales, both online and in store.

344
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:36,651
And there was a takeaways, another
company, which is an e commerce

345
00:20:36,651 --> 00:20:39,991
and, to digital content streaming
and cosmetics, cosmetic retail.

346
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:41,831
It's just another example.

347
00:20:42,761 --> 00:20:46,011
These are some of the examples
and real time case studies.

348
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:48,661
Okay, moving on.

349
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:49,901
challenges.

350
00:20:50,281 --> 00:20:55,766
whenever know, whenever there is
something, even in IT, there is a huge

351
00:20:55,766 --> 00:20:57,626
amount of data is being collected.

352
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,976
and this is all done in an algorithm.

353
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:04,821
you might, as based on our conversation,
there is a, there are There is

354
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:10,421
so much of data churning, data
filtering, data being analyzed to

355
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:12,211
come up with a personalized coupon.

356
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:16,191
And whenever we deal with data,
there is always challenges and

357
00:21:16,271 --> 00:21:18,601
always data can be manipulated.

358
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:22,131
Data can be done anything, it
can be used against you as well.

359
00:21:22,551 --> 00:21:27,191
So just make sure we are using
these data in a very useful

360
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:29,281
way for the benefit of someone.

361
00:21:29,471 --> 00:21:35,741
we just have, to have a few guardrails
and number one would be the data privacy.

362
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:40,881
The increasing, resilience on,
professional data, data rises concerns

363
00:21:40,921 --> 00:21:45,311
about security because we are not just
going to, randomly just, understand a

364
00:21:45,311 --> 00:21:50,791
person because we are collecting some
personal data as well, based on, like age,

365
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:55,781
his, spending history, uh, you, because
you need to know the person, right?

366
00:21:55,821 --> 00:21:57,871
some of the health, health information.

367
00:21:58,101 --> 00:22:03,021
Say for example, if a person is diabetic,
okay, you're not going to give, a

368
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:08,971
coupon to buy more, sugar or, or a
very sweet carving, products, right?

369
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:12,611
So obviously that, that, that guy
is not going to, based on his.

370
00:22:13,071 --> 00:22:16,381
based on his health, he's
going to decide his, future.

371
00:22:16,381 --> 00:22:21,181
And, and you don't want somebody to
know, that you have some health issues.

372
00:22:21,261 --> 00:22:23,461
Obviously it is just, it's just me.

373
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:27,561
talking about, you, there are some
security and regulatory compliances

374
00:22:27,591 --> 00:22:29,976
that we want every company to, to have.

375
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:31,156
to follow.

376
00:22:31,406 --> 00:22:38,576
those are CCPA and G-D-R-P-R and business
must be transparent about the data use and

377
00:22:38,576 --> 00:22:43,746
you're just gonna, give the information
to these companies based on, and, and, and

378
00:22:43,746 --> 00:22:48,821
we also wanted to know that this companies
is using my data, to generate the coupon.

379
00:22:49,306 --> 00:22:51,736
make sure everything is transparent.

380
00:22:52,116 --> 00:22:54,116
algorithm bias.

381
00:22:54,116 --> 00:23:00,146
The AI models can inadvertently
predicate bias based on the demographic

382
00:23:00,196 --> 00:23:02,166
leading to unequal treatment.

383
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:02,526
Okay.

384
00:23:02,806 --> 00:23:06,256
as I just mentioned, so regular audit
should be made, you don't know that

385
00:23:06,546 --> 00:23:11,066
I literally touch based on something
like, a person from a cold region, what

386
00:23:11,076 --> 00:23:16,446
he wanted from a heart region or from
a race, or he can be from a different,

387
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:19,036
demographic, location based on that.

388
00:23:19,246 --> 00:23:23,446
you should try to understand, say
if, for example, right now I'm living

389
00:23:23,446 --> 00:23:24,866
in a colder region and I just moved.

390
00:23:25,456 --> 00:23:29,226
My, my, my, I just moved means I've
just moved everything to another place.

391
00:23:29,236 --> 00:23:35,426
So it should understand and should not
be biased based on, okay, this guy, he's

392
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:40,006
not just going to buy, this, maybe I've
been buying this for all my day, life.

393
00:23:40,006 --> 00:23:42,146
So still the coupon
personalization to work.

394
00:23:42,146 --> 00:23:44,766
So each has to be a constant check.

395
00:23:45,316 --> 00:23:48,296
every time I, we buy something,
just make sure, that.

396
00:23:48,296 --> 00:23:52,056
the algorithm is reading based
on where the customer is buying,

397
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:53,596
which of the store he's getting it.

398
00:23:53,626 --> 00:23:55,856
So just have a track of the customer.

399
00:23:56,386 --> 00:24:00,006
next one is balancing
personalization and intrusiveness.

400
00:24:02,076 --> 00:24:06,306
over personalization may feel Allow
customers to control their data and

401
00:24:06,306 --> 00:24:08,786
provide transparency on how it is used.

402
00:24:09,106 --> 00:24:09,466
again.

403
00:24:09,611 --> 00:24:14,621
Sometimes you are over personalized,
you may feel very bad, every time, over

404
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:19,681
personalization, it can be based on the
history rather than giving suggestions

405
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:23,921
that you may not, say if you're buying
apple, I don't like grapes, why would

406
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:26,801
I need based on your fruit buying?

407
00:24:27,931 --> 00:24:34,081
History you cannot suggest some Fruit that
might be harmful that for that particular

408
00:24:35,031 --> 00:24:41,511
Person, so just don't over personalize
Personalization is also a bad so make

409
00:24:41,511 --> 00:24:45,901
sure that you have a customer have the
control say there should be something

410
00:24:45,911 --> 00:24:51,901
Invariant an option where it could say,
don't suggest me any of these fruits,

411
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:57,711
something like, or don't suggest me any
of these products, though I have bought

412
00:24:57,721 --> 00:25:02,411
them in the past for someone, but I'm
not really interested, so there should

413
00:25:02,411 --> 00:25:06,546
be some guardrails on that as well, show
me these, or don't show these products.

414
00:25:06,726 --> 00:25:08,356
products, which are, not relevant.

415
00:25:08,656 --> 00:25:11,396
for example, the product
should know that, I'm a man.

416
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:14,666
I might've bought something for
a woman or my wife, but it should

417
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:19,306
not just give me a suggestion to
buy a woman's product all the time.

418
00:25:19,356 --> 00:25:22,266
I'm sure like you, you would understand
what is over personalization means.

419
00:25:22,286 --> 00:25:23,856
I'm just, let's get into that next topic.

420
00:25:23,896 --> 00:25:24,186
Okay.

421
00:25:24,546 --> 00:25:28,336
technical challenges, required
advanced data infrastructure.

422
00:25:28,616 --> 00:25:32,656
skills, AI talents, this is
always a biggest challenge.

423
00:25:33,456 --> 00:25:38,666
Though there are a lot of, AI enthusiasts
in there, but the investments for

424
00:25:38,676 --> 00:25:44,276
doing the data analyzation, data,
data warehousing, data cleaning,

425
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,586
this is all a biggest challenge.

426
00:25:46,636 --> 00:25:50,396
in the recent days right now, until
there is, very high much demand in

427
00:25:50,396 --> 00:25:55,006
the skill set of AI talents, the
person who is deciding on working on

428
00:25:55,006 --> 00:25:58,816
that, who really have to have that
knowledge on what he's trying to do.

429
00:25:59,216 --> 00:26:04,422
there's definitely a significant barrier
for small companies to come up with

430
00:26:04,422 --> 00:26:08,486
these, with these technical challenges
because the infrastructure that is,

431
00:26:08,556 --> 00:26:10,366
that's been built for these are.

432
00:26:10,856 --> 00:26:12,866
are a lot and is expensive.

433
00:26:13,296 --> 00:26:17,506
so highlights, solution approaches
like regular algorithms, audit, data

434
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:21,626
analyzation and customer consent
management tools should be used.

435
00:26:21,946 --> 00:26:25,776
the solution approach has to be,
audited at least six or three

436
00:26:25,776 --> 00:26:27,736
months every or at least a year.

437
00:26:28,216 --> 00:26:30,516
so these are some of the
ethical, and challenges.

438
00:26:30,866 --> 00:26:34,316
for doing this AI coupon personalization,
let's move on to the next.

439
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:39,076
whenever we do something, it's always
that you have to measure that, right?

440
00:26:39,126 --> 00:26:41,196
say, I would say the progress.

441
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:42,746
So this year I have accomplished that.

442
00:26:43,211 --> 00:26:44,291
What is for the next year?

443
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:48,031
It's I think we are all most
professionals working in those companies.

444
00:26:48,321 --> 00:26:53,081
we are always tied up with
the kpis End of the year.

445
00:26:53,081 --> 00:26:56,911
It's always a question your manager asks
you what kpis are how it is not just

446
00:26:56,911 --> 00:27:00,041
you it's for any product or Anything.

447
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:00,731
How have you?

448
00:27:00,801 --> 00:27:03,071
done from the past year to this year.

449
00:27:03,151 --> 00:27:05,391
these are the key performance indicators.

450
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:06,751
One is customer engagement.

451
00:27:06,761 --> 00:27:09,081
Have you really got success on this?

452
00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:13,291
how many click rates that the customer,
click through rates, the time spent

453
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:16,921
on the page, the interaction in that,
and the, gauge interest that customer

454
00:27:16,931 --> 00:27:21,131
had, this, These are some of the
KPIs that we need to measure, while

455
00:27:21,131 --> 00:27:25,161
introducing this, coupon personalization
for any e-commerce or site.

456
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:27,081
The next is, conversation rates.

457
00:27:27,131 --> 00:27:29,531
measure the percentage
of personalized offers.

458
00:27:29,861 --> 00:27:35,061
you just have a track on, recipients
who make this purchase comparing with

459
00:27:35,061 --> 00:27:36,821
the non-personalized, campaigning.

460
00:27:36,881 --> 00:27:42,041
That's a good point, see that, How
many people that have really used

461
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:47,201
this coupon, if they have not used
it, try to educate the customer.

462
00:27:47,211 --> 00:27:51,271
Hey, you have some, something like this
in your app, or when you're buying,

463
00:27:51,281 --> 00:27:54,521
you should, because it's based on
your history, this offer is available.

464
00:27:54,651 --> 00:27:56,981
Maybe they might have not seen
your email, maybe they are

465
00:27:56,981 --> 00:27:58,501
not, but I've used your app.

466
00:27:58,501 --> 00:27:59,681
So educate the customer.

467
00:27:59,681 --> 00:28:04,391
So have that conversation, rate And try
to analyze that particular, particular

468
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:09,531
subject on, on whether this offers that
are being really redeemed by the customer.

469
00:28:09,581 --> 00:28:09,951
Okay.

470
00:28:10,011 --> 00:28:10,811
Redeem ration rate.

471
00:28:10,821 --> 00:28:11,081
That's it.

472
00:28:11,381 --> 00:28:13,511
so how many recipients do you
use as the postional equipment

473
00:28:13,511 --> 00:28:16,441
indicating the relevance and
appealing, appeal of the offer?

474
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:19,161
So are these real, really relevant?

475
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:22,761
some of the times they might show you
something which is not even relevant.

476
00:28:23,171 --> 00:28:26,901
You just go back and check your
data is accurate or is it something

477
00:28:26,901 --> 00:28:28,681
that, that is not correct.

478
00:28:28,731 --> 00:28:32,321
that is something that, you need
to have a valid, validation check

479
00:28:32,351 --> 00:28:35,591
every six or three months here just
based on whether it is working.

480
00:28:35,921 --> 00:28:40,261
customer lifetime value, so whatever we
do, unless otherwise customer is satisfied

481
00:28:40,536 --> 00:28:42,516
There is no, no value on that, right?

482
00:28:42,566 --> 00:28:46,796
So you have a metrics like a KPI
where you assess the impact on

483
00:28:46,796 --> 00:28:48,366
a long term revenue generation.

484
00:28:48,946 --> 00:28:52,116
From a particular customer, how
much the revenue has been generated?

485
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:56,471
I don't think many of the, many of
them know, or any retail store how

486
00:28:56,471 --> 00:29:00,821
many times I use this go to Walmart
or a particular store to buy this.

487
00:29:00,821 --> 00:29:04,291
And how much, I have generated
for, for the Walmart, because I go

488
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:05,761
to different Walmarts every time.

489
00:29:05,761 --> 00:29:08,401
I think, there should be a
generalized way to monitor that.

490
00:29:08,521 --> 00:29:08,701
Okay.

491
00:29:09,121 --> 00:29:10,321
Then, KP analysis.

492
00:29:10,321 --> 00:29:11,911
Explain how to send benchmark.

493
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:14,401
don't be shy to create new strategies.

494
00:29:14,776 --> 00:29:20,126
new KPIs, whenever you see something,
you set your, and start, measuring those

495
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:24,136
indications against those traditional
coupon and distribution methods.

496
00:29:25,536 --> 00:29:28,016
Okay, talking about
next, what is the future?

497
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:29,416
the future is pretty simple.

498
00:29:29,786 --> 00:29:33,026
I know the AI is advancing
into rapid growth.

499
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:36,876
this industry has been rocking
and it is going at a speed.

500
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:39,046
I would say it's going
at the speed of light.

501
00:29:39,306 --> 00:29:40,856
So there are so many improvements.

502
00:29:40,896 --> 00:29:44,026
Every day you re, you take,
you read a tech newspaper.

503
00:29:44,266 --> 00:29:48,686
There was something or the other, in
the, in, in any corner of this world.

504
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:51,986
They've been talking about
AI and ML and new innovations

505
00:29:51,986 --> 00:29:53,606
are being reported every day.

506
00:29:53,946 --> 00:29:56,766
So based on that, we need
a future directions where

507
00:29:56,766 --> 00:29:58,276
we got, granular targeting.

508
00:29:58,751 --> 00:30:02,321
A advancements will enable more
precision customer segments

509
00:30:02,591 --> 00:30:04,061
and hyper-personalization.

510
00:30:04,501 --> 00:30:08,911
so we are just getting more
details and how I can offer some

511
00:30:08,911 --> 00:30:12,061
discounts in a very minute manner.

512
00:30:12,121 --> 00:30:17,881
That is, gang, granular targeting,
integration with a, AR and vr.

513
00:30:18,086 --> 00:30:19,056
that's the future, right?

514
00:30:19,836 --> 00:30:21,036
AR and VR is so exciting.

515
00:30:21,036 --> 00:30:22,286
It's a broader chapter again.

516
00:30:22,626 --> 00:30:26,066
so I'm just going to put my
glasses and just say, Hey, I'm

517
00:30:26,066 --> 00:30:28,046
just looking for some apples now.

518
00:30:28,246 --> 00:30:30,916
If I'm just thinking in my mind,
it's almost like just done.

519
00:30:30,966 --> 00:30:32,256
It just gives you the coupon.

520
00:30:32,286 --> 00:30:34,696
Just all the purchases will be done.

521
00:30:34,906 --> 00:30:38,216
And next any moment my apples
will be arriving at my door.

522
00:30:38,496 --> 00:30:41,136
So virtually try on and
argument, the rear end.

523
00:30:41,581 --> 00:30:45,091
argument to reality shopping, you
don't have to go physically inside

524
00:30:45,141 --> 00:30:50,431
the store, but regularly just put up
with your AR and just do the shopping.

525
00:30:50,971 --> 00:30:54,831
And by the time you see something on
the store in your AR, in your, through

526
00:30:54,831 --> 00:30:58,981
the glasses, it's almost like it just
gives you that, particular, okay, there

527
00:30:59,061 --> 00:31:03,341
is an offer rather than you don't have
to do an app search or you don't have

528
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:05,851
to, go to the website to get a coupon.

529
00:31:05,861 --> 00:31:08,391
The coupon is already shown in your eyes.

530
00:31:08,621 --> 00:31:10,921
how fascinating and why
is activated commerce?

531
00:31:10,941 --> 00:31:14,951
Okay, that's another, common and
everywhere, I ordered my pizza through

532
00:31:14,951 --> 00:31:17,391
my, voice activated, devices at home.

533
00:31:17,631 --> 00:31:20,841
if I wanted, I just tell my
Google home to buy something.

534
00:31:20,841 --> 00:31:21,595
So how about a Google home?

535
00:31:21,786 --> 00:31:25,906
how about checking, whether you have
a coupon or something, in, through

536
00:31:25,906 --> 00:31:29,496
your personal assistant, or your voice
assistant, speaker that can just,

537
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,636
Alexa, just give me, I wanted to buy
something, do you have a discount here?

538
00:31:32,636 --> 00:31:34,736
Yeah, it just throws you
an offer, Pretty cool.

539
00:31:34,736 --> 00:31:34,956
Yeah.

540
00:31:35,576 --> 00:31:40,066
So ethical AI practices, increase
focus on AI transparency and fairness,

541
00:31:40,096 --> 00:31:45,216
expect evolving revolution framework,
and govern AI use in the marketing.

542
00:31:45,226 --> 00:31:46,236
Innovation trends.

543
00:31:46,516 --> 00:31:53,586
Discuss how AI can adapt a new data source
like IoT, wearable technologies, and

544
00:31:53,646 --> 00:32:00,031
provide even more Contact ab, their pro,
promotions that is more important, right?

545
00:32:00,061 --> 00:32:05,071
that's, these are all the, the future,
future, this is all the recommendation,

546
00:32:05,071 --> 00:32:06,961
like innovation trends, right?

547
00:32:08,021 --> 00:32:12,091
which I would really, which is
something that it's very creative,

548
00:32:12,371 --> 00:32:14,621
pro I call this creative promotions.

549
00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:15,926
moving on to next.

550
00:32:18,046 --> 00:32:20,576
We have come to the end
of this presentation.

551
00:32:22,246 --> 00:32:27,696
as I told you, I think my message
is pretty clear on what I have been.

552
00:32:27,956 --> 00:32:33,246
This AI coupon personalization, you
would see in even a very small store,

553
00:32:34,716 --> 00:32:36,496
in any given point, in any time.

554
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:41,526
You go to a personalization, small shop
and you wanted to pick something, these

555
00:32:41,556 --> 00:32:44,226
personalized coupons will be everywhere.

556
00:32:44,536 --> 00:32:48,036
you can get into an e commerce
site or, or a gas station.

557
00:32:48,036 --> 00:32:54,346
You wanted to buy something, any small,
tiny shops, to retain the customers.

558
00:32:54,586 --> 00:32:58,366
These will, these, AI coupon
personalizations will be pretty common.

559
00:32:58,366 --> 00:33:02,296
in, in the recent, in the recent years
coming, in the coming years, all these,

560
00:33:02,316 --> 00:33:09,846
traditional newspaper, coupons will just
be gone and, you will know from just

561
00:33:09,856 --> 00:33:14,726
looking, you get information, through
your app or it can be from any of your,

562
00:33:14,836 --> 00:33:18,686
devices that there is a coupon available
on what, where you go, by the time you

563
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:22,946
go to the store, every time you enter
the store, there is something that You

564
00:33:22,946 --> 00:33:24,716
know, you're thinking to buy something.

565
00:33:24,776 --> 00:33:26,366
There is a discount available for them.

566
00:33:27,116 --> 00:33:27,596
It's simple.

567
00:33:27,816 --> 00:33:29,166
is as simple as that.

568
00:33:29,536 --> 00:33:34,926
it can be electronics, it can be
pa paper, it can be, vegetables.

569
00:33:34,926 --> 00:33:38,006
It can be, a meat, or
you want to buy some.

570
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:41,831
Food, something like, I don't know whether
you, I have, recently I went to a store

571
00:33:41,831 --> 00:33:43,571
where I wanted to purchase something.

572
00:33:43,571 --> 00:33:45,441
I was, though, there, there was a coupon.

573
00:33:45,651 --> 00:33:48,411
They immediately just throws
me another coupon saying that,

574
00:33:48,441 --> 00:33:50,481
Hey, are you having a food?

575
00:33:50,671 --> 00:33:52,021
I said, when I click okay.

576
00:33:52,111 --> 00:33:54,841
And he said, you just throw, Hey,
there is a burger that is available

577
00:33:54,841 --> 00:33:57,111
free for you based on your purchase.

578
00:33:57,291 --> 00:33:58,071
How cool is that?

579
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:01,091
and somewhere that is linked
to the Amazon, store as well.

580
00:34:01,571 --> 00:34:06,671
so again, advanced machine learning
algorithms, business can analyze

581
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:10,341
vast amount of customer data to
leverage high, highly targeted.

582
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:14,821
As I, this is all, conclusion is
just, I'm just talking about, whole

583
00:34:14,821 --> 00:34:16,361
presentation in couple of lines.

584
00:34:16,411 --> 00:34:21,451
So this is how, a personalized
coupon, remediation is done.

585
00:34:21,881 --> 00:34:23,841
And the benefits are very clear.

586
00:34:24,126 --> 00:34:25,506
the business grows.

587
00:34:25,576 --> 00:34:29,366
it really, get, gets you what you wanted.

588
00:34:29,646 --> 00:34:33,566
build, it builds, a very tight,
close relationship with that store.

589
00:34:33,846 --> 00:34:36,486
it just makes the customer happy.

590
00:34:36,746 --> 00:34:38,786
a happy customer, happy buying.

591
00:34:39,116 --> 00:34:40,286
it goes for the store.

592
00:34:40,376 --> 00:34:43,286
It just keeps the
customer for a long term.

593
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:44,966
and it also help.

594
00:34:45,256 --> 00:34:51,786
it also helps the person every time that
you buy something, there is some other,

595
00:34:51,806 --> 00:34:56,156
it just values the money as well for
both of the customer and the end users.

596
00:34:56,846 --> 00:35:00,406
the rest of the things, it is
pretty straightforward on what I do.

597
00:35:00,526 --> 00:35:04,166
I am not going very technical
on how the, how, what are the

598
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:06,246
algorithms is all being used.

599
00:35:06,246 --> 00:35:10,486
But in a very general pay, high
level, these are the, these are some

600
00:35:10,486 --> 00:35:14,266
of the, this is going to be, coupon
personalization will be pretty common.

601
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:19,281
I'm sure like everyone in every
industry might like to, use it.

602
00:35:19,281 --> 00:35:23,561
it can be, it can be, if you want,
can be to, if you right now decide

603
00:35:23,561 --> 00:35:26,721
to go and watch a movie, think
about if there is a discount or a

604
00:35:26,721 --> 00:35:28,131
coupon available for that movie.

605
00:35:28,131 --> 00:35:29,061
How cool is that?

606
00:35:29,241 --> 00:35:32,686
Or if you wanted to go and watch a
game right now, interest and you don't

607
00:35:32,686 --> 00:35:35,836
know whether there will be a coupon
available, if there is a coupon available.

608
00:35:35,836 --> 00:35:38,996
just by checking, just by, based
on your history and based on

609
00:35:38,996 --> 00:35:40,986
your, relevant, how cool is that?

610
00:35:40,986 --> 00:35:43,446
So that cool is what this AI.

611
00:35:43,966 --> 00:35:49,346
Personalization, personalization is,
and I just wanted to thank everyone

612
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:55,536
for this opportunity to talk to you
and just through my insight and vision

613
00:35:56,856 --> 00:36:02,986
about the impact in, impact of machine
learning in, in coupon personalization.

614
00:36:03,276 --> 00:36:06,766
And thank you and you
have a wonderful day.

615
00:36:07,106 --> 00:36:07,716
See you soon.

616
00:36:07,746 --> 00:36:08,126
Thank you.

617
00:36:08,216 --> 00:36:08,406
Bye.
