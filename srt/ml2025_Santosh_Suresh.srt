00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,899
Hi my friends.

2
00:00:01,899 --> 00:00:06,820
This is Santo, so I am here to talk about.

3
00:00:07,884 --> 00:00:13,004
The advances in minimal invasive
diagnostic and treatment across medical

4
00:00:13,004 --> 00:00:19,605
specialties such as Ute bronchoscopy
are using a flexible endoscope

5
00:00:19,664 --> 00:00:22,334
with LED and HD camera on the tip.

6
00:00:23,115 --> 00:00:28,334
These innovations enhance the
precision of diagnosis and treatment,

7
00:00:29,174 --> 00:00:35,020
hence improving outcome which
is revolutionizing patient care.

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,980
In the past decade and a half,
there has been dramatic progress

9
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,930
on flexible endoscopy space.

10
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:48,739
The surgeon or pulmonologist can now see
heart to visualize regions of the human

11
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:56,300
anatomy, such as the lungs, with the
advent of small CC, d sensors that could

12
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,459
be placed in the tip of an endoscope.

13
00:00:59,644 --> 00:01:04,985
And shining light at the tissue
through a fiber optic bundle.

14
00:01:04,985 --> 00:01:11,825
Using an external light engine was
the state of art say 10 years ago.

15
00:01:11,825 --> 00:01:16,154
But today we have there
is a HD revolution.

16
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:23,265
The camera sensors got better in terms
of resolution with CM OS technology,

17
00:01:23,265 --> 00:01:29,955
enhanced photon or light responsibility
that surgeons can see the tissue,

18
00:01:32,715 --> 00:01:37,965
identify and evaluate lesion or features
of interest with high confidence

19
00:01:40,035 --> 00:01:42,885
with visual feedback
received from what they see.

20
00:01:44,055 --> 00:01:49,125
We currently have small, powerful LEDs
that can give light output in the order

21
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:54,855
of five to 10 lumen at a wide cone
angle to eliminate the tissue to give

22
00:01:54,855 --> 00:01:57,435
high quality imagery of human anatomy.

23
00:01:58,435 --> 00:02:04,765
Today we have a 10 20 P HT
resolution imaging that offers

24
00:02:04,765 --> 00:02:06,595
unprecedented clarity with.

25
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:13,990
One 70 degrees field of view that
enables wider view of anatomical

26
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,410
structure with very low latency.

27
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:22,710
60 FPS image that captures motion
such as beating pulse smoothly or can

28
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,680
visualize vasculature with great detail.

29
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,410
Today, the size of endoscopic
tip has gone down from.

30
00:02:31,815 --> 00:02:42,705
10 to 15 outer diameter to about five
outer diameter leading to enhanced patient

31
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:46,095
comfort in minimally invasive procedures.

32
00:02:47,095 --> 00:02:49,555
And there has been
breakthrough in illumination,

33
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:54,985
size, and capability of
illumination technology.

34
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,280
LED on tip.

35
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,590
The size of the LED on tip
has gone from two to three

36
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,880
diameter to about 0.57 diameter.

37
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,160
So the LED, the what?

38
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,297
The two to three lED.

39
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:20,050
The light output of the two to 3M
LED is same as 0.57, about less than

40
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:25,990
an M-M-L-E-D today, minimizing the
thermal impact on the surroundings

41
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,850
and the thermal management, sophisticated
heat dissipation mechanisms and

42
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,740
temperature regulation systems.

43
00:03:38,465 --> 00:03:42,905
Are designed to safeguard
tissues from thermal exposure.

44
00:03:43,905 --> 00:03:49,515
These LEDs are state of the art, can
deliver exceptionally visibility,

45
00:03:49,515 --> 00:03:54,465
exceptional visibility in poor,
accessible, an chemical regions, and

46
00:03:54,465 --> 00:03:56,386
light absorbing environments minutes.

47
00:03:57,386 --> 00:04:04,526
So there are various imaging modalities
modalities RGB imaging by far the

48
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:11,856
most common imaging modality where the
standard full colorization visualization.

49
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:16,551
Providing comprehensive tissue assessment
with natural color reproduction for

50
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:21,051
accurate and automatical identification
during routine examinations.

51
00:04:21,891 --> 00:04:27,411
Then we have near IR imaging
that's specifically used to reveal

52
00:04:27,411 --> 00:04:33,561
subsurface vascular network networks
and structural abnormalities.

53
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:38,631
Clear pixel technology is used.

54
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:46,711
To in challenging light stared
environments to ensure diagnostic

55
00:04:46,711 --> 00:04:53,371
accuracy, even in presence of bodily
fluids or visual obstruction, narrow

56
00:04:53,371 --> 00:04:59,641
band imaging or optical filtering
technology that isolates specific

57
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:05,110
blue green wavelength to dramatically
enhance mucosal surface patterns.

58
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:11,161
And microvascular morphology for early
detection of pathological changes.

59
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:19,741
So the endoscope tip, barring the LED and
the camera, we have space for biopsy tools

60
00:05:21,091 --> 00:05:26,191
that biopsy tools, injection devices,
irrigation systems, and energy delivery.

61
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:28,591
The biopsy tools can be used to.

62
00:05:29,631 --> 00:05:36,580
Extraction of a lesion for analysis
injection devices like therapeutics,

63
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,020
administrative therapeutic agents directly
to the sites, their energy delivery.

64
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,495
So you want to abl a
kidney stone, et cetera.

65
00:05:50,445 --> 00:05:51,285
With a laser.

66
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:57,135
So basically we can penetrate
a laser if you want to perform

67
00:05:57,135 --> 00:06:00,345
lacing irrigation system.

68
00:06:00,345 --> 00:06:03,885
So if you want to suck
out the bodily fluid

69
00:06:06,105 --> 00:06:13,785
in a procedure, say oscopy, the extra
space in the shaft could be used

70
00:06:13,785 --> 00:06:16,155
for these regions for these reasons.

71
00:06:17,535 --> 00:06:21,216
The, the clinical applications
across specialties.

72
00:06:23,106 --> 00:06:31,326
It's like gastroenterology, pulmonology,
urology, otolaryngology, that's the ENT.

73
00:06:34,236 --> 00:06:38,676
You can see the diagnostic
improvements between standard

74
00:06:38,676 --> 00:06:40,956
endoscopy and HD endoscopy.

75
00:06:41,616 --> 00:06:43,506
And HD plus enhancement.

76
00:06:43,926 --> 00:06:49,086
So from standard endoscopy to the HD
plus enhancement, we see about 15 to

77
00:06:49,086 --> 00:06:53,616
20% rise in sensitivity and specificity.

78
00:06:54,576 --> 00:06:58,131
So the accuracy improves
about 15 to 20%, which is big.

79
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:02,766
What are the benefits for the patient?

80
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,336
Benefit for the patient is shorter.

81
00:07:06,336 --> 00:07:07,566
Hospital stays.

82
00:07:09,126 --> 00:07:12,156
It is reduced from multiple
days to mere hours.

83
00:07:12,786 --> 00:07:17,616
So if you can imagine if I have
to do a biopsy of a lung to see if

84
00:07:17,616 --> 00:07:20,496
there is cancer or not, I need not.

85
00:07:21,336 --> 00:07:24,096
So a patient may not
stay for multiple days.

86
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:26,736
A single day is enough.

87
00:07:26,736 --> 00:07:31,716
Using a flexible bronchoscope, go to the
accurately, to the lesion, and then get

88
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:35,016
the, use the tools to conduct biopsy.

89
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:37,455
Less pain medication,

90
00:07:38,455 --> 00:07:42,895
significantly decreases pain
medication requirements, minimizing

91
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:48,926
side effects and dependency concern,
faster return to activities, dramatic

92
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,570
reduction in recovery time as well.

93
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:57,850
Lower total cost, substantial
reduction in financial burden through

94
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:03,580
decreased facility fees, medical
expenses, fewer follow up visits.

95
00:08:04,781 --> 00:08:09,820
What is the impact of the healthcare
impact on the healthcare institution?

96
00:08:10,931 --> 00:08:12,671
Reduced procedure times.

97
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:18,311
30% decrease in average procedure
duration, allowing more efficient

98
00:08:18,311 --> 00:08:22,781
utilization of specialized
resources, increased patient volume.

99
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:30,730
Significant 25% increase in daily
procedure per endoscopic suit, enhances

100
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:35,905
access to critical diagnostics,
improved patient experience.

101
00:08:38,215 --> 00:08:43,645
It's 92% positive feedback, ratings,
reflecting, enhanced comfort and

102
00:08:43,645 --> 00:08:46,166
reduced anxiety during the procedures

103
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:50,276
and superior financial return.

104
00:08:51,236 --> 00:08:55,766
So the inventory cost of the equipment
for the hospital or the healthcare

105
00:08:55,766 --> 00:09:02,606
institution can be recovered within
within 16 months, demonstrating

106
00:09:02,606 --> 00:09:04,406
exceptional operational value.

107
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:13,571
Implementation considerations,
capital investment could be 50,000

108
00:09:13,571 --> 00:09:18,521
to about quarter million to quarter
to half a million depending on

109
00:09:18,521 --> 00:09:25,031
configuration, specialized training
for the staff to ensure proper

110
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,281
system utilization and maintenance.

111
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:33,341
Maintenance requirements, regular service
intervals and sterilization protocols,

112
00:09:33,341 --> 00:09:40,781
external equipment lifespan integration
with EMR, digital archiving of images

113
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:43,901
and findings enhances documentation,

114
00:09:46,361 --> 00:09:47,376
future directions.

115
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:49,336
AI assisted diagnostics.

116
00:09:49,616 --> 00:09:54,266
Machine learning algorithms will enhance
lesion detection and classification.

117
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:59,606
Automated analysis may flag
abnormalities during procedures.

118
00:10:01,675 --> 00:10:05,695
A robotic integration, remote
manipulation will increase precision.

119
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:10,766
Autonomous navigation systems
will access difficult anatomy.

120
00:10:11,336 --> 00:10:17,036
Single use endoscopes disposable systems
will eliminate cross contamination risk.

121
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:20,036
Cost effectiveness will
improve mass production.

122
00:10:22,946 --> 00:10:27,266
AR vr visualization enhanced
3D mapping will improve spatial

123
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:32,786
orientation, immersive interfaces
that will provide intuitive control.

124
00:10:33,786 --> 00:10:34,146
Thank you.
