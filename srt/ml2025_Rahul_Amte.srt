00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,440
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,680
Welcome and thank you for
joining today's session.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,920
My name is Rahul Amte and I work as a
cloud architect with expertise in AI

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,440
infrastructure, DevOps, and security.

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,150
Today we are going to explore
how AI and machine learning

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,290
revolutionizing cloud automation.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,220
Transforming how we manage and
operate cloud infrastructure.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,410
This isn't just about automation.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,730
It's about intelligent automation
that anticipates, adapts

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,890
and optimizes in real time.

11
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,379
Basically, cloud computing, as we all
know, has become the backbone of modern

12
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:44,470
IT infrastructure, but as environments
become larger and more complex, manual

13
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,110
management is no longer feasible.

14
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,920
That's where AI and ML
come into the picture.

15
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:56,349
They offer intelligent automation
solutions that not only reduce human

16
00:00:56,349 --> 00:01:01,149
innovation, but also improve efficiency
and decision making across the board.

17
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:06,820
With that said, we also look at
like, why do we need automation?

18
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,110
What is the need for automation?

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,869
Cloud operations often involve
repetitive time and tasks such as

20
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:16,390
provisioning, scaling, and monitoring.

21
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:23,110
As organizations adopt multi-cloud or
hybrid cloud strategies, the operational

22
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,840
burden is increasing significantly.

23
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:31,750
So what can we do and how AI
can handle this and help us?

24
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:38,260
AI can handle this complexity with
ease, reduce human error, and enable

25
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,835
continuous service availability.

26
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:47,020
With that side, let's look at what
is AI powered cloud automation?

27
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:53,290
AI powered cloud automation refers to the
use of artificial intelligence and machine

28
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:59,320
learning algorithms to manage, optimize,
and troubleshoot cloud infrastructure

29
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,570
like traditional rule based automation.

30
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:05,200
We have currently, which of course
was not in the traditional world, but

31
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,759
in the current cloud world, AI learns
from historical and real time data.

32
00:02:10,135 --> 00:02:14,965
To make predictive and adapt
decisions automatically as you speak.

33
00:02:15,265 --> 00:02:21,705
We have some cool machine learning based
security tools already doing the real time

34
00:02:21,705 --> 00:02:24,315
data, predictive and adaptive decisions.

35
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:27,885
But just imagine spreading
this into the infrastructure.

36
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:31,095
It's definitely going to be
a powered cloud automation.

37
00:02:32,595 --> 00:02:36,465
Let's look at the core
capabilities of AI in cloud ops.

38
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,530
Let's talk about what AI can
actually do in the cloud.

39
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,050
It detects anize like certain
traffic surges or failures.

40
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,530
Predicts future needs, as a resource,
needs optimizes resource placement,

41
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,990
and triggers automated responses.

42
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:58,660
These intelligent futures can
create a self-managing, self-healing

43
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,020
environment with minimum manual effort.

44
00:03:02,905 --> 00:03:03,265
Isn't it?

45
00:03:03,265 --> 00:03:03,475
Cool?

46
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:05,855
Let's look at some use cases now.

47
00:03:06,814 --> 00:03:10,564
Predictive resource scaling is one of
the use case I wanna talk about today.

48
00:03:11,104 --> 00:03:12,574
With predictive scaling.

49
00:03:12,664 --> 00:03:18,004
AI monitors the historical usage
patterns to forecast upcoming demands.

50
00:03:18,184 --> 00:03:23,874
For example during an e-commerce flash
sale, like a, like during Thanksgiving

51
00:03:23,874 --> 00:03:29,214
or Christmas, AI can predict traffic
spikes and scale up resources in advance.

52
00:03:29,214 --> 00:03:35,469
I. This ensures performance while
minimizing over provisioning and cost.

53
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:37,719
Cost is one of the important factors.

54
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:44,079
At the same time, making sure that
consumer has no issues while there

55
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,959
is traffic surges, especially
during the holiday season.

56
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:49,870
So AI is definitely, a
helping factor there.

57
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,340
And the other use case is, as I
was mentioning, cost optimization.

58
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,160
Cloud costs can spiral quickly.

59
00:03:57,954 --> 00:04:04,285
AI helps by analyzing resource usage and
suggesting optimizations like right sizing

60
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:09,594
instances, shutting down ideal resources
or switching to reserved instances.

61
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:15,294
It's proactive, not reactive, and helps
maintain financial efficiency across

62
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:18,445
cloud deployments as it underlines.

63
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:20,335
It's proactive.

64
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:24,415
What we do today for cost
optimization is reactive.

65
00:04:24,475 --> 00:04:28,255
We have to set up things, we'll have to
make a decision, we'll have to execute

66
00:04:28,765 --> 00:04:34,885
to make it work, but AI can definitely
help us with the proactive nature and

67
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:39,325
help us in cost optimization, which
has been a major issue in most of the

68
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:45,865
organizations in this couple of years
because of the spinning of infrastructure

69
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:47,395
left and right in the last decade.

70
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:52,525
We look at other use case
where AI can help us.

71
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,915
Downtime is expensive.

72
00:04:54,515 --> 00:04:59,045
AI can significantly reduce
mean time to repair, which is

73
00:04:59,135 --> 00:05:01,775
by detecting failures, correct?

74
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:02,135
Correct.

75
00:05:02,705 --> 00:05:05,765
Correlating locks and metrics,
and automatically applying

76
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:07,655
fixes or rerouting traffic.

77
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,395
For example, if a note fails, a
can trigger a script to restart

78
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:13,865
the service of provision.

79
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:14,555
New instance.

80
00:05:15,005 --> 00:05:20,405
In the world of incident management
and self feeling, AI can act as

81
00:05:20,705 --> 00:05:22,805
the remediation as a service.

82
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:27,155
In the current setup we have in the
current world of infrastructure,

83
00:05:27,155 --> 00:05:30,034
we have incident response.

84
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:32,234
We have monitoring as service.

85
00:05:32,234 --> 00:05:33,945
We have alerting a service.

86
00:05:34,155 --> 00:05:38,054
Just imagine incidents response as an
automatic service would be awesome.

87
00:05:38,385 --> 00:05:40,844
That is what AI is going to do for us.

88
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,530
What are some key tools and platforms?

89
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,700
Let's look at some providers.

90
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,520
Each major cloud provider is
investing heavily in AI power tools.

91
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,920
As we already know, AWS offers DevOps,
guru and CloudWatch and MLA detection.

92
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,240
Azure has AI integrated with
the monitoring and monitor

93
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,370
and advisor, as in GCP.

94
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,190
Also provides auto ML
and cloud operations.

95
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,430
There are also some third party
apart from these three major

96
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,020
cloud providers native services.

97
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:15,050
The third party platforms like Dynatrace
and Splunk using AIOps are actually

98
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,640
used for the advanced automation
in the cloud infrastructure world.

99
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,300
But there are other tools, a lot
of companies investing in ai.

100
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,790
So there are a lot of other third
party tools as well, which are really

101
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,710
helpful, but we can only choose few.

102
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:32,080
Next let's look at benefits
of AI driven cloud automation.

103
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,260
The benefits are multifold,
as you already know.

104
00:06:35,755 --> 00:06:39,775
You get higher uptime through
proactive management, cost savings

105
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:43,165
through intelligent resource
allocation and enhance security

106
00:06:43,165 --> 00:06:44,545
through annually detection.

107
00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:51,055
It also frees up DevOps teams to focus on
innovation rather than the fight fighting.

108
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:56,865
Innovation as in making things better
and faster than actually trying to

109
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:58,905
fix things, troubleshoot things.

110
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:01,335
AI is one of our team members.

111
00:07:02,405 --> 00:07:04,145
Of course, every.

112
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:07,735
Future comes with some challenges
and some considerations.

113
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,205
Let's look at some here.

114
00:07:10,344 --> 00:07:13,405
However, as I said, there
are challenges to consider.

115
00:07:13,735 --> 00:07:17,725
AI systems are only as good as
the data they are trained on.

116
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:21,205
Poor data quality can lead
to incorrect decisions.

117
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:27,205
Integration with legacy systems can be
complex, and there's always the concern

118
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:30,355
of blindly trusting automated decisions.

119
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:32,905
So especially in the
regulatory industries.

120
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:37,960
We'll have to be very careful
because some decisions made based

121
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:43,509
on the data, poor data quality
can lead to some big problems.

122
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:50,049
So definitely the quality of the data of
the training being given for the models

123
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:54,010
that's considered by AI is very important.

124
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:59,979
With that said, I would like to
conclude by talking about the future

125
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,054
outlook of AI in cloud automation.

126
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:08,440
From what I said altogether, to sum it
up, AI and ML are pushing the boundaries

127
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,810
of what's possible in cloud operations.

128
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:14,979
Today, we are moving towards future
of autonomous cloud management, where

129
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:20,560
AI handles provisioning, optimization,
and even security in real time.

130
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:25,479
This evolution is not just
inevitable, it's already underway.

131
00:08:25,869 --> 00:08:28,270
It's going to get better and amazing.

132
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,180
Once again, thank you for the opportunity.

133
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,730
I really enjoyed it and
really appreciate your time.

134
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:34,450
Thank you.
