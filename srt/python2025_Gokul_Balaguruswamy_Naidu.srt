00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,130
revolutionizing IoT data management.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,280
This topic is at the heart of
technological innovation, combining

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,380
the power of Internet of Things and
advanced data management techniques.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,259
IoT has transformed the way we interact
with the world, connecting billions

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,490
of devices that generate and exchange
massive amounts of data in real time.

7
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,730
From wearable fitness trackers
to industrial automation systems.

8
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:32,055
IoT is driving efficiency, intelligence,
and convenience across industries.

9
00:00:32,655 --> 00:00:36,585
However, with this progress comes
the challenge of managing and

10
00:00:36,585 --> 00:00:41,225
making sense of the vast amount
of data these devices produce.

11
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:45,184
In today's talk, we'll explore
the critical components of

12
00:00:45,194 --> 00:00:49,394
IoT data management, including
scalable architectures, security

13
00:00:49,394 --> 00:00:53,495
measures, intelligent solutions,
and the pivotal role of Python.

14
00:00:54,724 --> 00:00:59,355
Python has become the go to language for
IoT development because of its simplicity,

15
00:00:59,765 --> 00:01:05,465
versatility, and a vast library ecosystem
that supports hardware interfacing, data

16
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,895
processing, machine learning, and more.

17
00:01:08,465 --> 00:01:11,875
By the end of this session, you'll
understand how these technologies

18
00:01:11,894 --> 00:01:15,745
come together to shape the
IoT ecosystem of the future.

19
00:01:22,574 --> 00:01:25,205
Scalable architectures for IoT.

20
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:30,615
Scalability is a foundational
principle of IOD systems.

21
00:01:30,714 --> 00:01:34,865
As IOD adoption grows, the number
of connected devices is expected

22
00:01:34,884 --> 00:01:37,164
to exceed 30 billion by 2030.

23
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:43,365
Each device continuously generates data,
and IOD architectures must scale to

24
00:01:43,365 --> 00:01:48,644
handle this exponential growth without
compromising performance and reliability.

25
00:01:49,584 --> 00:01:51,894
Now let's look at real
time data processing.

26
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:57,330
Real time data processing ensures
that IOD systems respond instantly

27
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,679
to the data they receive.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,199
Imagine a smart city traffic system where
sensors monitor vehicles at intersections.

29
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,650
Data about traffic density is
collected and analyzed in real

30
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:14,190
time to adjust signal timings,
dynamically minimizing congestion.

31
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,369
Without real time processing,
these systems would fail

32
00:02:17,369 --> 00:02:18,589
to meet their objectives.

33
00:02:19,144 --> 00:02:23,535
Technologies like Apache
Kafka, Azure Stream Analytics

34
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:26,315
handle such real time streams.

35
00:02:26,644 --> 00:02:29,245
But Python's role is indispensable here.

36
00:02:29,565 --> 00:02:35,595
Python libraries like Pandas and PyKafka
enable developers to clean, process, and

37
00:02:35,595 --> 00:02:37,774
analyze incoming streams efficiently.

38
00:02:38,164 --> 00:02:43,550
For example, using Python's Pandas,
You can filter real time data for

39
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:50,820
anomalies like unexpected jams and
act on them in Instantly now the other

40
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:56,100
method is data pipelines and storage
data pipelines transform information

41
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:02,239
from ID devices to store and process
Processing units these pipelines must

42
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,600
handle diverse data types from sensor
ratings in to multimedia streams and

43
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,660
ensure they reach the correct destination.

44
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,590
Python's framework, such as Apache
Airflow, simplify the orchestration

45
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,000
of these pipelines, automating data
transfer and transformation tasks.

46
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,820
In terms of storage, IOD
system use databases optimized

47
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,470
for different requirements.

48
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,160
For instance, MongoDB is suitable
for unstructured data like images,

49
00:03:30,665 --> 00:03:37,255
While PostgreSQL handles structured
data like sensor logs, Python

50
00:03:37,255 --> 00:03:42,255
supports these databases through
libraries like pymongo and psycogp2,

51
00:03:45,954 --> 00:03:50,184
making it a versatile tool for
managing ID storage systems.

52
00:03:53,685 --> 00:03:56,964
Now let's look at security
in ID data management.

53
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:04,325
Security is a cornerstone of IoT systems
because these networks often handle

54
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:06,435
sensitive and mission critical data.

55
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:11,424
Think of medical IoT devices that transit
patient health metrics or industrial

56
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:13,214
systems controlling power grids.

57
00:04:13,614 --> 00:04:17,755
Any compromise in security could
lead to catastrophic consequences.

58
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,180
Now, let's look at data encryption.

59
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,120
Encryption protects data
from transmission, ensuring

60
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,350
that even if intercepted, the
information remains unreadable.

61
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:36,299
Protocols like TLS and SSL are standard
in RD systems for secure communications

62
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:37,940
between devices and servers.

63
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,980
For instance, a home security camera
transmitting video footage to a

64
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:48,060
cloud server encrypts the data using
TLS to prevent unauthorized access.

65
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:52,844
Python simplifies this encryption
task with libraries like

66
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:55,635
Cryptography and pyCryptodome.

67
00:04:56,034 --> 00:05:00,854
A developer can use these tools to
encrypt sensitive IoT data streams,

68
00:05:00,894 --> 00:05:03,104
ensuring secure end to end communication.

69
00:05:04,425 --> 00:05:06,264
Authentication and authorization.

70
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:13,185
So, IoT devices must verify their identity
before accessing a network or a system.

71
00:05:13,455 --> 00:05:17,065
And the only authorized entity
should be, should, that should have

72
00:05:17,094 --> 00:05:19,145
access to specific data or controls.

73
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,710
Protocols like OAuth2 and JSON
Web Tokens are commonly used for

74
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,820
authentication and access controls.

75
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:31,990
For example, in a smart home,
only authorized devices like your

76
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,470
smart home or thermostat should
be able to access the central hub.

77
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:41,910
Python libraries such as Authlib allow
developers to integrate OAuth2 and JWT

78
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:49,079
tokens seamlessly, providing robust
authentication mechanisms for IoT systems.

79
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,470
Intrusion detection.

80
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:57,300
Advanced IoT systems include
intrusion detection to identify and

81
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,159
respond to suspicious activities.

82
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,550
Machine learning models built
using Python libraries such as

83
00:06:04,049 --> 00:06:09,690
Scikit learn or PyTorch can analyze
network patterns for anomalies.

84
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,610
For instance, if a smart factory
detects unusual activity on its

85
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,910
network, such as Excessive data
requests from a single device.

86
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,700
The system can flag or block
the activity in real time.

87
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,430
Now let's look at intelligent
architectures with Python.

88
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,399
Python and AI in IOD.

89
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,920
Python is a natural fit for IOD
intelligence because of its extensive

90
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,469
support for AI and ML libraries.

91
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,110
Let's examine some specific applications.

92
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:47,664
Edge computing with AI.

93
00:06:47,955 --> 00:06:52,755
Edge computing involves processing
data closer to the source, such as on

94
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:57,465
the device itself, to reduce latency
and reliance on cloud infrastructure.

95
00:06:57,924 --> 00:07:04,304
For example, an autonomous drone
analyzes data from video feeds locally

96
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:10,444
to navigate obstacles without delays,
causing the Caused by sending data to

97
00:07:10,444 --> 00:07:16,335
a cloud server python libraries like
tensorflow lite and open cv Enable

98
00:07:16,344 --> 00:07:22,184
deploying ai models on the edge devices a
python based drone application Could use

99
00:07:22,184 --> 00:07:26,835
tensorflow lite to detect obstacles and
adjust its flight path in milliseconds

100
00:07:29,275 --> 00:07:34,004
Predictive analytics predictive analytics
involves historical data to prevent

101
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:39,430
future trends or events In IOD, this
is used for proactive maintenance

102
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,280
such as predicting when a machine
will fail based on sensor readings.

103
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,929
Python libraries like scikit
learn, XGBoost, and h2o.

104
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:51,679
ai are ideal for building
predictive models.

105
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:56,860
For instance, in an industrial IOD
setting, Python can analyze vibration

106
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,490
data from machinery and predict potential
failures, allowing for timely maintenance.

107
00:08:02,895 --> 00:08:08,735
Natural Language Processing NLP
enables IoT devices to interpret human

108
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:14,374
language, powering voice assistants
like Amazon Echo or Google Assistant.

110
00:08:22,424 --> 00:08:24,474
functionality for IoT systems.

111
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:29,104
For example, you could use Python to
create a voice controlled smart assistant

112
00:08:29,114 --> 00:08:34,660
for home automation, Allowing users to
control lights or appliances with natural

113
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:42,030
language commands data visualization
Data visualization helps make sense of

114
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:47,700
iot data by presenting it Presenting it
in an intuitive and actionable format

115
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:55,135
python's visualization libraries such
as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly are

116
00:08:55,175 --> 00:08:57,585
invaluable tools for creating dashboards.

117
00:08:57,765 --> 00:09:01,794
For instance, Python can power a
smart city dashboard by showing

118
00:09:01,814 --> 00:09:06,845
energy consumption patterns across
neighborhoods, helping administrators

119
00:09:07,205 --> 00:09:10,165
optimize resource distribution.

120
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,784
Now let's look at Python's
advantages for IoT.

121
00:09:23,415 --> 00:09:24,305
Ease of use.

122
00:09:24,385 --> 00:09:29,325
Python's simplicity makes it accessible
for developers of all levels.

123
00:09:29,885 --> 00:09:35,535

This support accelerates development
and ensures that IoT developers

134
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,290
have access to best practices and
solutions to common challenges.

135
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:25,109
Future of IoT data management.

136
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,280
Scalability.

137
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:33,630
Future IoT systems must handle billions of
devices and petabytes of data seamlessly.

138
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:40,530
Python's frameworks like Flask and
Django allow developers to build scalable

139
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,880
IoT backends that grow with demand.

140
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:43,930
Security.

141
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:48,560
As quantum computing evolves,
IoT systems will require quantum

142
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,279
safe encryption algorithms.

143
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,170
Python's libraries like pycrypto
already enable experimentation with

144
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,740
these advanced cryptographic methods.

145
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,879
Intelligence.

146
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,030
Advanced AI will enable IoT devices
to make autonomous decisions.

147
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:12,499
Python, with its leadership in AI and ML,
will remain central to this evolution,

148
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:17,390
allowing devices to learn, adapt, and
optimize their behavior dynamically.

149
00:11:26,739 --> 00:11:29,279
Now let's look at the case
study of a smart city.

150
00:11:31,295 --> 00:11:37,305
Let's examine a practical application of
IoT in smart city infrastructure, a domain

151
00:11:37,315 --> 00:11:42,824
where IoT technologies are thriving,
are driving significant advantages in

152
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:45,215
urban management and sustainability.

153
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,305
Data collection.

154
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:50,874
The foundation of any smart
city system is data collection.

155
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:55,765
IoT devices such as environmental
sensors, traffic cameras, and smart

156
00:11:55,814 --> 00:12:00,125
meters collect a continuous stream
of data from urban environment.

157
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:04,760
For example, air quality sensors
placed around a city monitors

158
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,410
pollutants like CO2 and PM2.

159
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,030
5 in real time.

160
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,980
Similarly, traffic cameras use
computer vision to count vehicles

161
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:18,020
at intersections, while smart meters
track water and electricity usage.

162
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:22,899
Python plays a vital role here,
with libraries like Raspberry

163
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:29,115
Pi GPIO for hardware interfacing
and Paho MQTT for communication.

164
00:12:29,555 --> 00:12:33,885
Python allows developers to gather
and transmit sensor data efficiently.

165
00:12:34,235 --> 00:12:38,265
For instance, a Python script could
be used to aggregate air quality data

166
00:12:38,265 --> 00:12:43,725
from various sensors and send it to a
centralized cloud platform for analysis.

167
00:12:44,784 --> 00:12:46,315
Analytics and insights.

168
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:52,150
Once the data is collected,
the next step is Analysis.

169
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,910
Machine learning models can identify
patterns, predict future scenarios,

170
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,960
and generate actionable insights.

171
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:04,740
For example, Python's scikit learn can,
can be used to develop a predictive

172
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,379
model for traffic congestion.

173
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:12,039
By analyzing historical traffic
patterns and current sensor data, the

174
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,630
model can predict which intersections
are likely, are likely to experience

175
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,720
congestion and suggest alternate routes.

176
00:13:19,775 --> 00:13:25,155
Python's visualization libraries like
Plotly and Seaborn help in presenting

177
00:13:25,175 --> 00:13:29,105
these insights to city administrators
through interactive dashboards.

178
00:13:29,535 --> 00:13:34,544
For instance, a dashboard showing real
time air quality levels across different

179
00:13:34,545 --> 00:13:40,305
zones of a city can guide policy makers in
implementing pollution control measures.

180
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:43,605
Smart city services.

181
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:49,180
The culmination of data collection
and analysis is actionable

182
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,270
services that enhance urban living.

183
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,299
Examples include adaptive street
lighting, which adjusts brightness

184
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,890
based on pedestrian and vehicle
presence, or waste management

185
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:04,879
systems that optimize collection
routes based on bin fill levels.

186
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:10,300
Python enables the automation
of these services through APIs

187
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,020
and frameworks like Flask.

188
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,210
For instance, Python can power a back
end system that collects bin filled

189
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:21,500
data from IOD sensors, processes, and
sends optimized collection routes to

190
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,420
waste management trucks in real time.

191
00:14:23,969 --> 00:14:28,150
Smart cities can demonstrate
how IOD coupled with Python can

192
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:32,510
create systems that are efficient,
sustainable, and responsive to

193
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,940
the needs of urban populations.

194
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:42,985
Now let's look at a case study
for industrial automation.

195
00:14:46,355 --> 00:14:51,435
So industrial automation is a critical
area for improving efficiency, reduced

196
00:14:51,445 --> 00:14:56,144
downtime, and enhancing safety in
manufacturing production environments.

197
00:14:57,865 --> 00:14:58,944
Machine monitoring.

198
00:14:59,425 --> 00:15:03,385
In industrial settings, IoT
devices monitor machinery to

199
00:15:03,415 --> 00:15:05,125
ensure optimal performance.

200
00:15:05,444 --> 00:15:09,984
Sensors attached to equipments
track variables like temperature,

201
00:15:10,064 --> 00:15:11,814
vibration, and pressure.

202
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:16,445
For example, in a manufacturing
plant, vibration sensors on a

203
00:15:16,445 --> 00:15:21,505
motor detect abnormalities that may
indicate wear or impending failure.

204
00:15:22,074 --> 00:15:28,224
Python facilitates the development of such
monitoring systems through libraries like

205
00:15:28,584 --> 00:15:34,835
Raspberry Pi GPIO for sensor integration
and Pandas for processing sensor data.

206
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:38,735
A Python script can
continuously read data from.

207
00:15:39,185 --> 00:15:43,655
Vibration sensors process it
and store it for real time

208
00:15:43,725 --> 00:15:46,105
monitoring or further analysis.

209
00:15:47,825 --> 00:15:48,974
Predictive maintenance.

210
00:15:49,495 --> 00:15:53,834
So this is one of the most impactful
IoT applications in the industry.

211
00:15:54,045 --> 00:15:58,024
Instead of relying on scheduled
maintenance, predictive systems analyze

212
00:15:58,034 --> 00:16:03,155
sensor data to determine whether a
machine is likely to fail, allowing

213
00:16:03,165 --> 00:16:05,145
repairs to be scheduled proactively.

214
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,590
Python's scikit learn and
XGBoost libraries can be used

215
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,390
to develop predictive models
based on historical data.

216
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:18,400
For instance, if a machine's vibration
exceeds a certain threshold repeatedly,

217
00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:23,769
the model can predict that a bearing
is likely to fail soon, promptly

218
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:26,210
time, prompting timely maintenance.

219
00:16:26,849 --> 00:16:30,490
This reduces downtime and
prevents costly breakdowns.

220
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,020
Python's role doesn't
stop at building models.

221
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:37,800
It also handles deployment through
frameworks like TensorFlow Lite,

222
00:16:37,849 --> 00:16:42,389
which allows predictive models
to run directly on edge devices

223
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,400
for real time decision making.

224
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:50,999
Process Optimization IoT driven
automation goes beyond maintenance to

225
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,909
optimize entire industrial process.

226
00:16:54,190 --> 00:17:00,139
For example, IoT systems in a production
line can adjust conveyor belt speeds

227
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:07,055
and dynamically based Uh, on real time
production data, preventing bottlenecks

228
00:17:07,095 --> 00:17:09,075
and maintaining smooth workflows.

229
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:14,605
Python enables process optimization
through control algorithms and APIs.

230
00:17:14,885 --> 00:17:19,095
Using Python, developers can
write scripts that analyze data

231
00:17:19,124 --> 00:17:24,425
from production line, identifying
inefficiencies, and automatically sending

232
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:26,425
commands to adjust machine settings.

233
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:32,950
Libraries like PYSerial facilitate
communication with industrial hardware,

234
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,609
enabling seamless integration between
IoT devices and factory systems.

235
00:17:38,249 --> 00:17:42,510
Industrial automation powered by
Python and IoT not only improves

236
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:49,030
productivity, but also enhances safety and
sustainability in manufacturing process.

237

00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:20,229
concept Once you once you're comfortable
with python and basic iot concepts.

295
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:25,030
The next step is building a proof of
concept A proof of concept is a small

296
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,530
scale model for your IoT solution
that demonstrates its feasibility.

297
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:33,660
For example, imagine you want to
create a smart agriculture system.

298
00:22:34,409 --> 00:22:38,969
Your POC could include sensors that
monitor soil moisture and temperature,

299
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,274
a Python script that collects this
data and analyzes trends, a simple

300
00:22:44,274 --> 00:22:47,965
interface that recommends irrigation
schedules based on the data.

301
00:22:48,564 --> 00:22:52,044
Python's tools and framework make
this process straightforward.

302
00:22:52,165 --> 00:22:56,835
For instance, you can use Flask
to create a lightweight web

303
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:59,375
application and display sensor data.

304
00:23:00,174 --> 00:23:05,545
Matplotlib can help you generate real time
visualizations of soil moisture levels.

305
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:11,505
SQLite 3 can help you with storing
historical data in a local database.

306
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:18,690
This POC doesn't need to be perfect,
you know, it's, it's meant to test your

307
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,649
idea and identify potential challenges.

308
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:27,180

00:24:11,685 --> 00:24:12,385
Security.

320
00:24:13,335 --> 00:24:17,035
Implement robust security
measures as your solution scales.

321
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:24,575
Use encryption protocols like TLS, SSL,
and secure APIs for device communication.

322
00:24:24,885 --> 00:24:29,075
As your user base grows, ensure
device privacy by incorporating

323
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:33,845
authentication mechanisms like
OR2 using Python's AuthLib.

324
00:24:34,795 --> 00:24:35,925
Optimizations.

325
00:24:36,335 --> 00:24:41,915
Scaling also requires optimizing your
application for performance and cost.

326
00:24:42,735 --> 00:24:47,525
Use Python's AsyncIO for asynchronous
programming to handle multiple

327
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:51,865
IoT devices concurrently, ensuring
efficient data processing.

328
00:24:53,014 --> 00:24:58,114
For machine learning tasks, frameworks
like TensorFlow Lite allow you to deploy

329
00:24:58,165 --> 00:25:03,024
lightweight models on edge devices,
reducing cloud dependency and latency.

330
00:25:05,195 --> 00:25:09,945
IoT specific platforms leverage
IoT platforms like AWS IoT Core,

331
00:25:09,945 --> 00:25:13,474

These platforms simplify
IoT data management, data

333
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,870
processing, and scalability.

334
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,500
Python's SDKs for these services
make integration straightforward.

335
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:29,289
Let's visit a smart agriculture example.

336
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:35,079
After scaling, your system could include
a network of hundreds of sensors deployed

337
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:41,029
across multiple farms, a cloud based
dashboard providing real time insights

338
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:47,110
to farmers, Automated irrigation systems
