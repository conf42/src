1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,550
There are very interesting
findings, we identified part of

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,620
this cost of data breach report.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,989
So they identified close to around 4.

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:20,529
4 million is the average cost of a
data breach, which is really expensive.

5
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,195
And they also identify close to
more than 46 60 percent of data

6
00:00:26,195 --> 00:00:29,104
breaches involve personal data.

7
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:37,695
That's very, I would say a dangerous
precedent because it's like 50 percent

8
00:00:37,695 --> 00:00:41,535
of the time it's the customer data.

9
00:00:42,225 --> 00:00:46,755
So these are some of the challenges
being exposed part of numbers.

10
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,005
Hi everyone.

11
00:00:48,635 --> 00:00:50,594
My name is Indika Vimalasuriya.

12
00:00:50,595 --> 00:00:52,775
Welcome to DevSecOps 2024.

13
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:57,795
Today we'll discuss how you
can build a secure future.

14
00:00:58,295 --> 00:01:04,604
in complex landscape and how
we can leverage AIOps to drive

15
00:01:04,734 --> 00:01:07,864
operational resilience on AWS.

16
00:01:08,364 --> 00:01:11,975
I'll walk you through some of the
challenges in distributed systems

17
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:16,935
and why it's hard and then we'll get
into some of the detailed aspects

18
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:24,165
of AIOps and the security offering
in AWS and we will go into very

19
00:01:24,195 --> 00:01:26,855
detailed AWS implementation use cases.

20
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,940
Very focused on real world and security.

21
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:36,110
And we'll wrap it up with some of the
strategies and some of the metrics

22
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:41,400
we should be focusing on when we
are going through this journey.

23
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,440
So a little bit of myself.

24
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,990
I'm based out of Columbus, Sri Lanka.

25
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,720
I'm a reliability engineering
advocate and a solution architect.

26
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,560
I specialize in site reliability
engineering, observability,

27
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,169
AIOps and generative AI.

28
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,120
I'm a passionate trainer.

29
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:05,040
An energetic technical blogger I'm
also very Proud to hold AWS community

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,030
builder title from AWS under cloud
operations category and also very proud

31
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:16,710
to be ambassador at DevOps institute
So let's move into the detail So

32
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,050
what are the challenges we face in?

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,870
The today's distributed systems.

34
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:27,350
We see a lot of challenges
When we are working on cloud,

35
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:33,150
these challenges touch upon
multiple life cycle phases.

36
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,620
And we'll go through and see what
are these challenges and why,

37
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,780
we have to be vigilant of this.

38
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,540
So identifying something in our ecosystem
is always a challenge because, we have

39
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,740
this, limited visibility across resources.

40
00:02:51,325 --> 00:02:57,545
So there are challenges related to in case
system telemetry data coming from, like

41
00:02:57,615 --> 00:03:03,495
multi cloud or poly cloud environments
and identifying assets and dependencies

42
00:03:03,785 --> 00:03:06,605
and, the dynamic nature of things.

43
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:11,505
So those are very
challenging things to manage.

44
00:03:12,005 --> 00:03:15,375
So when it comes to protect, like how
are we going to protect our state?

45
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:19,324
And we have a challenge
of preventive controls.

46
00:03:19,745 --> 00:03:24,545
because, enforcing consistency across
distributed systems is very hard.

47
00:03:25,245 --> 00:03:29,595
And also configurations in cloud, and
especially when it comes to native

48
00:03:29,595 --> 00:03:35,342
clouds, and, some of the vulnerabilities
it can arise are also very challenging.

49
00:03:35,342 --> 00:03:40,475
So when it comes to detect, how
quickly you can detect a threat,

50
00:03:40,665 --> 00:03:42,705
that, that's the challenge.

51
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:48,665
And I had to be agree that we have made
significant progress in this regard.

52
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,005
There's a lot of.

53
00:03:50,445 --> 00:03:54,545
things in place, but that has
also resulted in, there's a

54
00:03:54,655 --> 00:03:56,545
lot of noise in our systems.

55
00:03:56,925 --> 00:04:01,415
So false positives, noise is one of
the big problem when you are trying

56
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:07,104
to identify threads and difficulty
in finding out, the insider threads.

57
00:04:07,604 --> 00:04:12,654
Within the distributed access model
is also very challenging aspects.

58
00:04:13,154 --> 00:04:14,404
And then respond.

59
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:16,174
How are we going to respond?

60
00:04:17,004 --> 00:04:21,874
The fragmented incident response,
it's a one key challenge area, lack of

61
00:04:21,874 --> 00:04:29,924
integration tools across the cross cloud
responses and a delay in some of these

62
00:04:29,924 --> 00:04:37,654
automating playbooks in the regions and
different parts of our infrastructure.

63
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:39,404
is a key challenge.

64
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,074
And then recovery, generally
we take, considerable of

65
00:04:43,104 --> 00:04:45,484
time to, recover ourselves.

66
00:04:46,014 --> 00:04:50,764
So insufficient disaster recovery
planning in cloud native environments

67
00:04:50,764 --> 00:04:56,984
and Restoration to the pre incident
states due to the complex nature of

68
00:04:56,984 --> 00:04:59,564
our systems are always a big challenge.

69
00:05:00,064 --> 00:05:03,954
And also we have a challenge at our
governance as well because of the

70
00:05:03,954 --> 00:05:10,584
compliance overhead and keeping pace
with the, the continuously changing

71
00:05:10,594 --> 00:05:14,714
regulatory requirements across
globe is a very challenging thing.

72
00:05:15,394 --> 00:05:19,264
And ensuring our state
is always audit ready.

73
00:05:19,764 --> 00:05:25,224
The fact that our state is built on
dynamics, nature, dynamics, scaling.

74
00:05:25,724 --> 00:05:29,144
And on top of that, we need to
ensure things are audit ready

75
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,784
is one of the big challenge.

76
00:05:31,184 --> 00:05:34,984
So if you can see different
aspects of our life cycle of

77
00:05:35,324 --> 00:05:39,384
operations, like the security
operations, like identifying things.

78
00:05:39,934 --> 00:05:45,774
In protecting things, detecting,
responding, recover, and overall

79
00:05:45,784 --> 00:05:50,524
governance, each and every area, we
have seen some of the challenges.

80
00:05:50,694 --> 00:05:55,989
And these challenges are across, the cloud
systems, probably on premise as well.

81
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:02,819
And this has been increased or amplified
because we have been moving from on

82
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:08,269
prem to cloud and with cloud, it's
the dynamic nature, elasticity that

83
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,809
has created some of the challenges
and our monolith applications.

84
00:06:12,809 --> 00:06:19,369
We have moved into microservices with
dependencies and, it's again creating

85
00:06:19,369 --> 00:06:27,339
a lot of, challenge as well and finally
we have our telemetry data Like we

86
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:32,469
have the logs metrics traces and these
things and this is generating Again,

87
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:37,569
a high num high volume of data and
because we have high volume of data

88
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,409
Again, it's a data paradox situation.

89
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:44,929
We are more data with less care
is not provide much information

90
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,274
So it's again a challenge So

91
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:54,064
moving on, let's, get into, some of the
offerings, AWS is offering and how AWS

92
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:57,104
is focusing on, meeting this challenge.

93
00:06:57,604 --> 00:07:02,314
So before we go any further, I think
we all have to be familiar with,

94
00:07:02,604 --> 00:07:08,044
or let's at least cover the AWS
Shares Responsibility Model when

95
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:09,854
it comes to the security pillar.

96
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:13,304
So AWS covers.

97
00:07:13,804 --> 00:07:19,724
AWS is responsible for security of
the cloud and it's about the global

98
00:07:19,724 --> 00:07:24,604
infrastructure, availability zones,
regions, edge locations, data centers.

99
00:07:24,914 --> 00:07:26,644
So it's AWS responsibility.

100
00:07:27,144 --> 00:07:32,154
And AWS also will ensure the
foundation services, security

101
00:07:32,154 --> 00:07:33,314
is being managed as well.

102
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:36,924
It's about compute, storage,
database and networking.

103
00:07:37,904 --> 00:07:39,254
So AWS is.

104
00:07:40,154 --> 00:07:43,824
In summary, responsible for what's

105
00:07:44,324 --> 00:07:47,894
inside the cloud or security of the cloud.

106
00:07:48,394 --> 00:07:53,474
And when it comes to us, the customers,
we are responsible for the security

107
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:58,114
and compliance in the cloud because we
are bringing in that customer content.

108
00:07:58,534 --> 00:08:02,414
We are developing our platforms,
applications, and we are responsible

109
00:08:02,474 --> 00:08:06,674
for tracking and maintaining and
managing identity and access management.

110
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:08,864
And we are responsible for.

111
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:13,689
The maintenance of operating systems
network firewalls and other configurations

112
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:17,499
we are building client side data
encryption server side data Encryption

113
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:19,889
and the network traffic protection.

114
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:23,769
So there's a very clear Distinguish here.

115
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:32,189
So aws will take care of the entire the
security of the cloud and we The customers

116
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:38,509
we want to ensure We secure what we're
going to put in the cloud You So this is

117
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:43,549
one of the key aspects we have to be aware
when we are going through this journey.

118
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:49,519
AWS is also offering a wide range
of tech stack, the services, when it

119
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,229
comes to identifying some of these
security problems and protecting our

120
00:08:55,229 --> 00:09:00,219
ecosystems or the infrastructure or the
application domain and detecting things

121
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:06,099
and also how we can investigate things
much faster, automate the response.

122
00:09:06,644 --> 00:09:07,914
respond and recover.

123
00:09:08,394 --> 00:09:13,424
So these are some of the services
AWS is providing, which allows us to

124
00:09:13,824 --> 00:09:19,874
streamline this entire life cycle,
identify, protect, detect, investigate,

125
00:09:20,114 --> 00:09:22,004
automate and response and recover.

126
00:09:22,624 --> 00:09:23,854
So it's very important.

127
00:09:24,184 --> 00:09:31,339
We, whoever who's going to leverage AWS
or cloud And any cloud provider has a

128
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:35,539
understanding of these services because
you don't have to really reinvent the

129
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:41,149
wheel, but you just have to ensure you use
these services so that we can develop a

130
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:47,349
good practice when it comes to deploying
your data in the cloud and ensuring

131
00:09:47,609 --> 00:09:49,639
that what's in the cloud is Transcribed

132
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:52,779
So there are a lot of
services, AWS is offering.

133
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:59,009
So when it comes to identify,
you have AWS security hub, AWS

134
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:04,419
organizations, AWS control tower,
and trusted advisor, which actually

135
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:06,779
provide a lot of good capabilities.

136
00:10:07,354 --> 00:10:13,344
And we also have AWS service catalog, AWS
config and AWS well architected tools and

137
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:17,034
systems manager which is also providing
a lot of capabilities here as well.

138
00:10:18,004 --> 00:10:23,984
So under protecting things, we have AWS
transit gateway, the, all the foundational

139
00:10:23,984 --> 00:10:32,544
services like Amazon VPC and your AWS
Shield, IEM policies, Amazon Cognito, WAF.

140
00:10:32,554 --> 00:10:36,654
So there are firewall manager,
a lot of stuff, right?

141
00:10:37,024 --> 00:10:41,324
And detecting, we have Amazon
GuardDuty, the Amazon, the inspector

142
00:10:41,584 --> 00:10:43,344
and a lot of other services.

143
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:48,834
So when it comes to the automation, we can
use a CloudWatch to build a lot of these

144
00:10:49,194 --> 00:10:50,574
integrations or the trigger CloudWatches.

145
00:10:51,074 --> 00:10:57,274
like the observability tool aws have
so with that we can observe What's

146
00:10:57,284 --> 00:11:01,914
happening inside this security the
bubble and whenever there are triggers?

147
00:11:02,214 --> 00:11:07,584
We are able to trigger aws step
functions or systems manager lambda

148
00:11:08,004 --> 00:11:13,359
And with that we can actually build
a very comprehensive Workflow and

149
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:15,369
we can recover things much faster.

150
00:11:15,869 --> 00:11:20,469
So there are a lot of other services
as well, but highly early Yes, aws is

151
00:11:20,469 --> 00:11:25,579
offering a lot of services which allows
us to identify things protect things

152
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:32,899
proactively and detect things especially
using ai things like The aws mesh or the

153
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:37,849
inspector guard duty and devops guru,
which we're going to discuss A little

154
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:40,519
in detail, in subsequent, presentation.

155
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,929
The slides are key.

156
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:45,899
Those collectively help us.

157
00:11:46,654 --> 00:11:53,614
To build a comprehensive security
driven, incident workflow also, as I

158
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:56,504
said, All our applications are growing.

159
00:11:56,664 --> 00:11:57,514
It's very complex.

160
00:11:57,764 --> 00:12:04,054
So observability is also key part So we
have aws cloud watch which is providing

161
00:12:04,434 --> 00:12:11,084
Ability to instrument our code and collect
this the data and we we can leverage aws

162
00:12:11,084 --> 00:12:15,724
cloud watch and probably open telemetry
You And it will allow us like this

163
00:12:15,744 --> 00:12:20,374
metrics, logs and traces, the key pillars
of observability on top of that we can

164
00:12:20,374 --> 00:12:26,934
build visualizations and we can build a
lot of insights and analytics and we have

165
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:28,874
the digital experience monitoring as well.

166
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:33,214
So the key pillars, the metrics,
logs and traces on top of that, the

167
00:12:33,214 --> 00:12:35,254
key AI features, the cloud watch.

168
00:12:35,684 --> 00:12:39,324
Is providing we can look at
the metric anomaly detection.

169
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:44,894
We can have the log anomaly detection
We can have ai driven natural language

170
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:49,974
query generations and log analytics And
there's intelligent insights as well.

171
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:53,744
So insights are coming from
both containers lambda The

172
00:12:53,744 --> 00:12:55,604
application insights ec2.

173
00:12:55,844 --> 00:13:00,274
So all these are very powerful
capabilities so all these leverage

174
00:13:00,274 --> 00:13:07,034
ai and the and These things provide
a lot of advanced option for us

175
00:13:07,294 --> 00:13:10,884
to be on top of the system issues.

176
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:15,054
So especially when it comes to any of
the security issues Not we are not going

177
00:13:15,054 --> 00:13:20,094
in a traditional way, but we can use
some of these AI ops capabilities to

178
00:13:20,094 --> 00:13:24,964
identify things much faster understand
the root cause much faster and prevent

179
00:13:24,964 --> 00:13:30,074
it and Not only that but actually go
and eliminate these things permanently.

180
00:13:30,574 --> 00:13:34,934
So generally With AIOps, what we
are looking at security, right?

181
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:39,904
what generally happen is we see a
incident, a security related incidents,

182
00:13:40,244 --> 00:13:42,564
and we want to identify it and fix it.

183
00:13:42,814 --> 00:13:47,454
So with AIOps, we want to
make it, really fast, right?

184
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:53,144
So if you look at it, the first task of
AIOps is even before service impacting

185
00:13:53,144 --> 00:13:54,834
issue happens, can we detect it?

186
00:13:55,684 --> 00:13:58,884
Can we detect that security
issue and can I eliminate it?

187
00:13:58,884 --> 00:14:05,744
We be more predictive maintenance So that
we can eliminate if not, can we detect

188
00:14:05,754 --> 00:14:09,174
the is the security incident much faster?

189
00:14:09,554 --> 00:14:13,844
And so that we can reduce our mean
time to detection and then we fix it

190
00:14:13,844 --> 00:14:18,114
much faster so that we can actually
reduce the time, the cycle time.

191
00:14:18,794 --> 00:14:24,374
The final is can we self feel things
like with, the, we discuss about the

192
00:14:24,374 --> 00:14:29,694
automation workflows Typically, AWS is
offering and leveraging these automation

193
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:31,704
workflows, the self feeling capabilities.

194
00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:37,004
We detect things and then we try
to resolve things much faster.

195
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:37,964
So that is.

196
00:14:38,304 --> 00:14:43,234
The whole advantage the ai ops offerings
are bringing into the table when it

197
00:14:43,234 --> 00:14:48,604
comes to managing high impact security
incidents So one of the other like very

198
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:55,344
cool service aws Has developed and been
evolving we have seen is devops guru.

199
00:14:55,744 --> 00:15:02,984
So it's a it's about analyzing Entire
your aws services like your entire thing

200
00:15:03,014 --> 00:15:08,594
like your account the tags and All the
services so it's able to look at the

201
00:15:08,594 --> 00:15:12,994
metric anomalies related events and
it can able to provide recommendation

202
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,579
So it will be continuously analyzing.

203
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:20,879
the purpose of, Amazon DevOps Guru, it's a
continuously analyze, analyze streams of,

204
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:23,729
the data coming from multiple, channels.

205
00:15:23,979 --> 00:15:27,039
And it's, I have the ability of
monitoring things, understand

206
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,419
relevant metrics to identify.

207
00:15:29,819 --> 00:15:34,079
And baseline the normal behavior
and on top of that understand

208
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:39,089
these, the deviations, the
outliers and the anomaly patterns.

209
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,229
And this is happening across
the entire, our AWS account.

210
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:46,299
So that way that Entire
thing is being covered.

211
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:52,219
So some of the key capabilities of DevOps
guru are it Can do anomaly detection a

212
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:57,559
very powerful anomaly detection and across
like the logs metrics and other things

213
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:01,879
And it's have the capability of root cause
analysis as well with the leveraging of

214
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:07,619
ai and correlating some of these data
sources It's able to do some smart root

215
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:12,539
cause analysis and guiding you in the
right direction It can provide a lot of

216
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:17,419
proactive insights And recommendations
to prevent, the security incidents

217
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:22,799
and it's able to also optimize some of
these Resources and probably identify

218
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:24,529
some of the weaknesses in advance.

219
00:16:24,979 --> 00:16:28,339
It is have some lot of good
Capabilities when it comes to

220
00:16:28,369 --> 00:16:29,769
database monitoring as well.

221
00:16:29,819 --> 00:16:35,689
So Some of these sql injections and other
database for related vulnerabilities.

222
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:41,369
We can mitigate And it's able to do
capacity planning assessment and more

223
00:16:41,369 --> 00:16:46,209
intelligent in that area as well So
it's able to also provide support when

224
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:50,159
it comes to cross service correlation
And it's pretty much integrated with

225
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:55,459
most of the aws services And it will
keep track of you know The security

226
00:16:55,459 --> 00:17:00,689
and other compliance things and also
the most important thing is it allows

227
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:05,999
us to Do automated remediations and
build self healing capabilities.

228
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:12,469
So it's one of the my one of my favorite
like very Useful services WSAS is

229
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:18,749
offering with that we can actually keep
Entire our state on check all the time.

230
00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:24,354
So let's go and check what are the
the real world applications, of

231
00:17:24,404 --> 00:17:27,714
AI ops in the, world of security.

232
00:17:28,054 --> 00:17:34,084
So you have already seen what are
the, what are the key services AWS

233
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:40,014
is offering and, how we can leverage
these offerings and also the offerings

234
00:17:40,014 --> 00:17:42,084
coming part of, observability as well.

235
00:17:42,524 --> 00:17:47,274
And with this, let's go and deep dive
into some of the use cases and try to

236
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:53,584
understand how, We can prevent some of
these security incidents by leveraging

237
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:57,174
this AIOps capabilities being offered.

238
00:17:57,674 --> 00:17:58,834
Let's go through them.

239
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:02,754
The first use case I would like
to walk you through is anomaly

240
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:04,484
detection in logs and metrics.

241
00:18:05,124 --> 00:18:08,034
So anomaly detection is a
very powerful capability.

242
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:12,474
What we are trying to do is we're trying
to baseline the performance when it

243
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:17,124
comes to logs and some of the security
related metrics and especially, logs,

244
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:19,734
because the access logs and other.

245
00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:25,744
Things so this way we can identify some
of the unusual behaviors in our systems

246
00:18:26,244 --> 00:18:31,124
So we can look at and find out some of
the unauthorized access attempts and

247
00:18:31,124 --> 00:18:37,654
identify Very suspicious configurations
or spot some of these lateral movement

248
00:18:37,654 --> 00:18:42,694
patterns So some of these examples,
we are able to monitor spikes in api

249
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:47,704
calls volume tied to a potential ddos
attack So the next time, they're like

250
00:18:47,744 --> 00:18:52,604
we see a spike in api calls like we can
go and correlate it What's happening

251
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:56,684
and whether it's something unusual or
whether it's something to do with the?

252
00:18:57,184 --> 00:19:02,024
Cybersecurity problem and detecting
anonymous API calls from unknown

253
00:19:02,024 --> 00:19:07,494
ips and especially whether these
ips are conflict behaving in, the

254
00:19:07,494 --> 00:19:14,184
connected manner and identify the fail
logins and burst of atoms as well.

255
00:19:14,484 --> 00:19:18,894
So it's pretty much like we, we
define a baseline for logs and the

256
00:19:18,894 --> 00:19:24,094
metrics and we try to understand the
outliers and some of these, anomalies.

257
00:19:24,384 --> 00:19:29,954
Which will help us greatly preventing
some of these security problems And second

258
00:19:29,954 --> 00:19:36,164
one is as I said, there's so much of data
here Like we have logs metrics traces.

259
00:19:36,164 --> 00:19:37,274
We have the observability.

260
00:19:37,554 --> 00:19:42,284
We have all the data coming from
the security services So correlating

261
00:19:42,394 --> 00:19:43,944
these things are very important.

262
00:19:44,274 --> 00:19:48,884
So ability to aggregate correlated
data from various sources It's a very

263
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:53,714
powerful capability Especially when you
are investigating things so that we can

264
00:19:53,714 --> 00:19:56,794
cut the noise and go to the root causes.

265
00:19:57,214 --> 00:20:01,194
So some of these, allows us to map
relationship between suspicious

266
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:05,514
attacks, because there are nowadays,
a lot of attacks are coordinated.

267
00:20:05,734 --> 00:20:10,914
So when that happens, the event
correlations and the service data help us

268
00:20:10,954 --> 00:20:17,014
to understand these coordinations and it
also help us to build unified timelines

269
00:20:17,024 --> 00:20:20,044
and unified response approaches as well.

270
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:22,004
So some of the examples.

271
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:27,129
correlating fail logins with outbound
traffic or linking a history bucket

272
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:33,819
access to a unusual IAM role or flagging
simultaneous logging from distant regions.

273
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:37,109
So this is again a very
powerful, capability.

274
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:40,744
use case because noise is
sometimes one of the greatest

275
00:20:40,744 --> 00:20:42,494
challenges we face these days.

276
00:20:42,904 --> 00:20:46,494
We have, we are doing a lot of good
work when it comes to, detecting things,

277
00:20:46,804 --> 00:20:51,414
but with the noise, it's, it take
us a lot of time to cut across these

278
00:20:51,414 --> 00:20:53,044
things to go to the actual problem.

279
00:20:53,614 --> 00:20:56,934
So event correlation is a powerful
capability which we can leverage

280
00:20:57,534 --> 00:21:02,974
to, reduce the MTTR of, dealing
with these major security incidents.

281
00:21:03,474 --> 00:21:07,324
And that also goes hand with the
noise reduction which are the with

282
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:11,944
the event correlation So this is about
filtering these irrelevant alerts

283
00:21:12,264 --> 00:21:17,364
and ensuring that there's no alert
fatigue And we the teams are always

284
00:21:17,364 --> 00:21:19,034
looking at the high priority incidents.

285
00:21:19,384 --> 00:21:25,924
So the reducing fault positives In guard
the duty or suppressing the duplicate

286
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:32,104
alerts or prioritizing high risk
vulnerabilities So if you exposed to,

287
00:21:32,314 --> 00:21:36,824
like thousands of vulnerabilities, you
had to reduce the noise, understand the

288
00:21:37,104 --> 00:21:40,464
key, essential, the high priority things.

289
00:21:40,764 --> 00:21:46,204
So we can use AI to really help us on
this regard and, trying to narrow down our

290
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:50,554
focus so that we can focus and get things
done instead of getting drowned with.

291
00:21:51,054 --> 00:21:55,184
Forecasting and is a
very powerful capability.

292
00:21:55,294 --> 00:21:59,894
So we can predict some of the potential
threats based on historical data.

293
00:22:00,274 --> 00:22:04,424
So we can look at, things in a
holistic way and identify risk

294
00:22:04,464 --> 00:22:06,014
even before they happen, right?

295
00:22:06,044 --> 00:22:08,974
That's one of the key
objectives of AI ops.

296
00:22:09,624 --> 00:22:14,284
And we can allocate resources,
proactively in advance to prevent

297
00:22:14,294 --> 00:22:16,004
some of these vulnerabilities as well.

298
00:22:16,594 --> 00:22:19,954
So some of the key examples,
predicting potential DDoS

299
00:22:19,954 --> 00:22:21,394
attacks from traffic patterns.

300
00:22:21,404 --> 00:22:26,244
So you don't really have to wait until it
happens, but the way it comes, it's going,

301
00:22:26,284 --> 00:22:30,974
it's like mimicking a classic, Traffic
pattern of a DDoS attack so that you can

302
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:35,574
be ready or we take your we look at we
apply some other use case to Understand

303
00:22:35,574 --> 00:22:41,854
these anomaly IPs now and the coordinated
fashion and we do correlation And then

304
00:22:41,864 --> 00:22:46,694
we are able to response much faster
and we can also look at anticipating

305
00:22:46,694 --> 00:22:53,374
IEM role misuses based on the behavior
and predicting future And forecasting

306
00:22:53,374 --> 00:22:59,194
also pat needs so forecasting is one
of the key high profile, capability or

307
00:22:59,204 --> 00:23:04,104
use case AIOps is offering and finally
the automated incident response.

308
00:23:04,414 --> 00:23:05,524
we had to do that.

309
00:23:05,604 --> 00:23:10,074
We had to identify things much faster,
but providing resolution is the key.

310
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:14,314
This might cut across multiple of
these use cases, the anomaly detection,

311
00:23:14,324 --> 00:23:16,554
the forecasting correlating things.

312
00:23:16,744 --> 00:23:21,074
So once you do that, Then probably it's
easier for us to automate the response

313
00:23:21,544 --> 00:23:27,464
And we can of course limit the blast
radius of these threats So we can do some

314
00:23:27,464 --> 00:23:33,374
auto isolation of compromise instance
or block malicious ips automatically

315
00:23:33,734 --> 00:23:38,814
Rework some of the compromise credentials
or the host or the services So there

316
00:23:38,814 --> 00:23:40,084
are a lot of automation workflows.

317
00:23:40,414 --> 00:23:47,089
We can develop using services offered
by AWS and threat intelligence.

318
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,559
It's a key part.

319
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:54,069
We can enhance some of these models to
look at the way things are coming in

320
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:58,559
and then obviously take more actions.

321
00:23:58,769 --> 00:24:03,359
So this can be more tailors to
understanding, evolving threats.

322
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:07,859
And some of these examples are
automatically backlisting traffic from

323
00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:13,869
some of the suspicious IPs or looking
at phishing attacks and enhancing

324
00:24:13,979 --> 00:24:16,139
logs with thread intelligence.

325
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:21,479
So those are some of the key things
which we can do part of enhanced

326
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:22,819
intelligent thread detection.

327
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:29,859
And we can definitely leverage AI to do
a lot of good behavior analytics as well.

328
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:36,209
So behavior analytics is to understand
what the user behaviors and try to

329
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:38,389
see what users are actually doing.

330
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:44,079
So this is about monitoring
typical behaviors to understand or

331
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:49,809
detect insider threats and ensure
that, we are compliant as well.

332
00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:53,919
Some of the examples are Spotting
access attempts outside work

333
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:59,669
hours or detecting unusual data
transfers by specific users or even

334
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:02,429
identifying unusual configurations.

335
00:25:02,699 --> 00:25:08,889
So the behavior analytics is a
very, Powerful, use case, like

336
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:10,369
we can look at the access logs.

337
00:25:10,369 --> 00:25:14,309
You can look at the, some of
the audit, the audit trails, or

338
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:18,079
you can look at application logs
or some of the metrics, the key

339
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,519
business centric metrics to do this.

340
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:25,139
So now that we have understanding of, what
are some of the high profile use cases.

341
00:25:25,554 --> 00:25:29,774
Let's look at, how, what are the
strategies in building, effective

342
00:25:29,774 --> 00:25:34,724
AIOps, framework to, mitigate
some of the cyber security risk.

343
00:25:35,224 --> 00:25:38,874
First and foremost, it's very
important to set the goal, right?

344
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,954
We just have to have a good
understanding what is our purpose,

345
00:25:42,384 --> 00:25:46,454
what are some of the threats and
what are some of the blast radius and

346
00:25:46,474 --> 00:25:48,494
how we can reduce this blast radius.

347
00:25:48,994 --> 00:25:51,334
some of the improvements we
are targeting when it comes to

348
00:25:51,334 --> 00:25:55,044
eliminating incidents or, MTTD, MTTR.

349
00:25:55,424 --> 00:25:56,834
So those are very important.

350
00:25:57,234 --> 00:26:01,394
We should also focus on where our
AIOps is going to integrate, what

351
00:26:01,414 --> 00:26:02,944
services it's going to monitor.

352
00:26:03,234 --> 00:26:06,464
it's very important you look at
things in a holistic way, look

353
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,284
at the logs, metrics and traces.

354
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:12,689
Look at the observability data
coming from this cloud trails or

355
00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:18,659
the guard duty and use some of these
capabilities like devops guru to have

356
00:26:19,629 --> 00:26:22,639
Ai taking care of the entire ecosystem.

357
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:25,829
We had to also be very collaborative.

358
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:32,149
We had to enable cross teams
synergy between all the teams in

359
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:37,579
the ecosystem so that this goal
of us being fulfilled by everyone.

360
00:26:38,499 --> 00:26:41,379
So we obviously had to use the CloudWatch.

361
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:46,459
CloudWatch is the more real time
observability tool offered by AWS and it

362
00:26:46,459 --> 00:26:51,724
is providing this Amazing capabilities
like anomaly detection the forecasting

363
00:26:51,784 --> 00:26:57,204
and other things So we had to definitely
plan to use these things and build those

364
00:26:57,214 --> 00:27:02,034
sophisticated Advanced capabilities
around that and obviously we'll have

365
00:27:02,044 --> 00:27:06,984
to go with the Automation is provided
by system manager or the lambda You

366
00:27:06,984 --> 00:27:11,784
can get the trigger from cloud watch
and then do the automation as well AWS

367
00:27:11,794 --> 00:27:15,104
is offering loads of tools, doesn't
mean that you have to use everything

368
00:27:15,104 --> 00:27:19,494
but you have to look at your read and
based on that you can pick some of these

369
00:27:19,494 --> 00:27:25,664
useful tools for you and with that you
can build a very, good AIOps framework

370
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:28,704
to support your cyber security needs.

371
00:27:29,464 --> 00:27:33,454
And you can look at the security
and compliance capabilities as well.

372
00:27:33,934 --> 00:27:35,984
There are a lot of
security compliance tools.

373
00:27:36,284 --> 00:27:42,084
checks and best practices AWS is
providing definitely leverage them and

374
00:27:42,084 --> 00:27:47,224
then finally it's about KPIs I always
try to believe regardless whether

375
00:27:47,224 --> 00:27:48,914
it's a security incident or anything.

376
00:27:48,914 --> 00:27:54,464
It's about the customer experience So
we have to keep on ensure we maintain

377
00:27:54,464 --> 00:28:00,394
those customer experience and then ensure
our systems are Available and reliable

378
00:28:00,394 --> 00:28:02,804
as well The, especially the data.

379
00:28:02,904 --> 00:28:07,524
So the data is available and
data is consistent and the data

380
00:28:07,524 --> 00:28:10,714
integrity is not being compromised.

381
00:28:10,884 --> 00:28:13,074
So those are some of the
key things we have to track.

382
00:28:13,504 --> 00:28:17,074
And then we have for all the
security incidents, we had

383
00:28:17,084 --> 00:28:18,504
look at mean time to detect.

384
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:25,029
Meantime to recover and meantime
between failures and also because

385
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:30,529
there's a lot of Eliminations we are
bringing in how many incidents how many?

386
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:38,209
the security incidents, we have been self
healed or eliminated and can all this lead

387
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:44,194
to like we improving volatility in our
systems as well So whole idea is that if

388
00:28:44,194 --> 00:28:49,694
I take a summary aws is offering Lots of
services and they have a very good model

389
00:28:49,704 --> 00:28:55,544
when it comes to shared responsibility
model where aws is responsible for

390
00:28:56,044 --> 00:29:03,979
what's been developed or what's been the
infrastructure side of the cloud and then

391
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:09,459
customers we are responsible for what
are we going to put in the cloud, right?

392
00:29:09,459 --> 00:29:15,449
so AWS is offering lots of services
to ensure that we can build a

393
00:29:15,449 --> 00:29:22,334
very comprehensive identification
protecting and ability to automate

394
00:29:22,374 --> 00:29:24,714
things and recover things much faster.

395
00:29:25,234 --> 00:29:29,684
And we also have the observability based
on CloudWatch, which is providing your

396
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:34,254
logs, metric traces, where you can apply
into all the places where you get the

397
00:29:34,254 --> 00:29:36,684
security, the telemetry data as well.

398
00:29:37,204 --> 00:29:41,004
And then on top of that, we can
do log anomaly detection, log

399
00:29:41,604 --> 00:29:46,794
or the metric anomaly detection,
forecasting, correlation, and noise

400
00:29:46,794 --> 00:29:48,834
reduction, and all those things.

401
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:54,429
And all of this help us in achieving
these targets, but it's very important

402
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:57,799
you baseline these things so that you
know where you are going and you are

403
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:59,909
continuously improving this matrix.

404
00:30:00,409 --> 00:30:01,389
So thank you everyone.

405
00:30:01,449 --> 00:30:02,649
Thank you for taking time.

410
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:25,714
well So there are lots of other good
tech the talks happening with deus ex

411
00:30:25,714 --> 00:30:33,164
ops 2024 organized by con42 So I request
you to join those sessions and learn

412
00:30:33,174 --> 00:30:37,454
about deus ex ops and new trends and
what's happening Thank you everyone.
