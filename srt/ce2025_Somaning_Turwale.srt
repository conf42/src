00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,530
Hello everyone and welcome to my session.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:08,750
I'm Somnath Trewale and today we are
going to talk about maximizing business

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,910
continuity with Azure Site Recovery.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,699
Little bit about me.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,480
I spent two decades in IT and
I'm currently a Senior Technical

6
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,100
Support Escalation Engineer at
Microsoft, specializing in Azure

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,070
Backup and Recovery Services.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,920
My job is helping organizations.

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,949
to build a stable business continuity
and disaster recovery solutions.

10
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:33,589
So let's get started.

11
00:00:34,089 --> 00:00:39,889
Before we get into Azure Site Recovery,
let's take a moment and talk about

12
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:42,800
why business continuity is important.

13
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:48,079
When a disaster strikes, whether
it's a hardware failure, a cyber

14
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,134
attack, or even a natural disaster,
organizations need to be prepared.

15
00:00:53,274 --> 00:01:00,124
A plan to minimize downtime and data
loss without a solid business continuity

16
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:06,604
strategy, recovering from disruption
can be slow, expensive, and chaotic.

17
00:01:07,094 --> 00:01:11,349
That said, implementing
business continuity is not an

18
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:13,919
easy and has many challenges.

19
00:01:14,589 --> 00:01:21,119
The organizations needs to consider
cost, complexity, and compliance.

20
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:22,889
What are the costs?

21
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:27,779
Running a secondary data center,
maintaining hardware, and managing

22
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:31,679
infrastructure expenses can be expensive.

23
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,949
And what is the complexity?

24
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:39,774
Restoring from tapes, Managing
multiple data centers and ensuring

25
00:01:39,894 --> 00:01:46,324
software compatibility, can add
operational overhead and compliance.

26
00:01:46,464 --> 00:01:52,724
Many organizations must meet regulatory
requirements, retain data for

27
00:01:52,734 --> 00:01:58,454
specific periods, and ensure service
availability, all of which can be

28
00:01:58,474 --> 00:02:01,654
challenging to manage effectively.

29
00:02:02,154 --> 00:02:08,414
We just talked about the challenges
to implement the business continuity.

30
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:15,064
Now we'll take a look at how Microsoft
can help to overcome these challenges.

31
00:02:15,994 --> 00:02:21,354
This is where Microsoft and more
specifically the Azure comes in.

32
00:02:21,504 --> 00:02:28,164
Azure helps organizations to tackle
the challenges in several ways.

33
00:02:28,804 --> 00:02:30,004
Reducing cost.

34
00:02:30,354 --> 00:02:34,614
With Azure, you don't have to
pay for additional infrastructure

35
00:02:35,274 --> 00:02:41,334
or for power, cooling, or IT
staff to manage a secondary site.

36
00:02:41,774 --> 00:02:44,954
You can only pay what you use.

37
00:02:45,429 --> 00:02:51,369
And with Simplified Disaster Recovery,
Azure Site Recovery automates failover

38
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:57,489
and recovery processes, so instead of
manual and a stressful recovery process,

39
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:04,299
you can restore workloads with just a
few clicks, ensuring the compliance.

40
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:10,079
Azure removes geographical
constraints, allowing businesses

41
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:16,799
to meet regulatory and compliance
requirements more easily by replicating

42
00:03:16,809 --> 00:03:20,319
workloads across multiple regions.

43
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:22,394
And now, let's Scaling.

44
00:03:23,144 --> 00:03:29,664
ASR supports replication across both
on premises and cloud environments,

45
00:03:29,884 --> 00:03:34,274
whether you are running Hyper
V, VMware, or physical servers.

46
00:03:34,774 --> 00:03:36,644
What is Azure Site Recovery?

47
00:03:37,144 --> 00:03:40,054
It's a tool here to
safeguard your business.

48
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:46,299
You need a robust BCDR strategy,
one that only protects your data,

49
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:52,789
but also keeps your applications and
workload operational, whether the

50
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:56,069
disruption is planned or unexpected.

51
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,909
That's where Azure Site Recovery comes in.

52
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,825
ASR is a key part of Microsoft
Disaster Recovery offering.

53
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,764
ASR is a key part of Microsoft
Disaster Recovery offering.

54
00:04:06,264 --> 00:04:12,434
Replicates the workloads from your
primary site to secondary location,

55
00:04:12,924 --> 00:04:16,494
whether on premises or in Azure.

56
00:04:17,274 --> 00:04:23,214
If a primary region goes down, workloads
can quickly fail over to the secondary

57
00:04:23,214 --> 00:04:26,124
site, keeping your applications available.

58
00:04:26,624 --> 00:04:34,244
Once your primary site is restored,
you can seamlessly fail workloads

59
00:04:34,394 --> 00:04:37,574
back to resume normal operation.

60
00:04:38,164 --> 00:04:45,014
ESR minimizes downtime and data
loss, making your business more

61
00:04:45,454 --> 00:04:47,604
resilient to our disruptions.

62
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:49,454
We looked at Azure Site Recovery.

63
00:04:49,454 --> 00:04:53,894
Now let's consider why
Azure Site Recovery.

64
00:04:54,499 --> 00:05:00,999
With ASR, you get a single unified
solutions for disaster recovery.

65
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:06,919
Azure Site Recovery supports
heterogeneous environments like Hyper

66
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,579
V, VMware, or and even physical servers.

67
00:05:12,109 --> 00:05:18,339
It also provides certified support for
enterprise applications like SharePoint,

68
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:21,409
SQL Server, Exchange, and Dynamics.

69
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:29,059
You can also do the disaster drills with
zero impact on a production environment.

70
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:36,979
It also provides industry leading
RTO and RPO, meaning your business

71
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:43,339
experiences minimal disruption
in the event of a failure.

72
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:46,889
Key concept in disaster recovery.

73
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:53,559
When we talk about disaster recovery,
two key metrics help to define

74
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,329
how prepared an organization is.

75
00:05:56,719 --> 00:05:59,599
The first one is recovery point objective.

76
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:06,699
This tells us how much data loss is
acceptable in the event of failure.

77
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:13,304
Essentially, it's the maximum Age
of a data that can be restored.

78
00:06:13,814 --> 00:06:19,644
A lower RPO means more frequent
backups or continuous replications

79
00:06:19,994 --> 00:06:21,684
to minimize data loss.

80
00:06:22,504 --> 00:06:25,334
Recovery time objective is the second one.

81
00:06:25,884 --> 00:06:30,734
This measures how quickly
systems and services need to

82
00:06:30,734 --> 00:06:32,984
be restored after a disruption.

83
00:06:33,854 --> 00:06:38,889
It's a maximum Downtime a
business can tolerate before

84
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:41,319
operation must be back online.

85
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:47,989
One of the biggest advantage of Azure
Site Recovery is that significantly

86
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:55,049
reduces both RTO and RPO compared to
traditional disaster recovery solution.

87
00:06:55,549 --> 00:07:00,209
With ASR, organization can
restore the business and critical

88
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,919
workloads in little as 15 minutes.

89
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:10,439
Minimizing operational impact and
allowing for a faster return to normal.

90
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:18,219
And also, ESR continuously replicates
data, ensuring that failover happens

91
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:20,619
quickly and with minimal data loss.

92
00:07:20,764 --> 00:07:24,844
So I mentioned, the status report.

93
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:34,364
Now, some of you are maybe understanding
why I am having the status report.

94
00:07:34,864 --> 00:07:39,174
Continuity even in the face
of unaffected disruption.

95
00:07:39,714 --> 00:07:41,444
Why this matters?

96
00:07:42,444 --> 00:07:48,584
By becoming a low recovery time
objective, near real time replication

97
00:07:48,624 --> 00:07:54,034
and automated failover, Azure Site
Recovery ensures that businesses stay

98
00:07:54,114 --> 00:08:00,724
up and running with minimal downtime,
without complexity and high cost of

99
00:08:00,764 --> 00:08:03,054
maintaining a secondary data center.

100
00:08:03,844 --> 00:08:09,574
With ASR, organizations can recover
faster, lose less data, and stay

101
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:16,174
compliant, all while leveraging the
power of the cloud for scalable,

102
00:08:16,584 --> 00:08:18,944
cost effective disaster recovery.

103
00:08:19,444 --> 00:08:24,369
Now, as we know, Azure Site
Recovery, supports Azure workloads,

104
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,339
Hyper V, VMware, and physical.

105
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:31,459
we are going to, deep dive into
the architecture of each one.

106
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:34,459
Let's get started with Azure
to Azure Site Recovery.

107
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,219
Recovery architecture.

108
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,989
Now let's talk about how ASR works
in Azure to Azure scenario and what

109
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:48,269
components are required to set it up
when running the workloads in Azure.

110
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:52,909
It's essential to have a disaster
recovery plan in place to protect

111
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:58,889
against unexpected outages, original
failures, or planned maintenance.

112
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:01,619
Azure Site Recovery enables.

113
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:08,459
Seamless replication of virtual machines
from one region to another, ensuring

114
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:11,569
business continuity with minimal downtime.

115
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,409
How it works?

116
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:22,629
ESR continuously replicates VMs from
primary region to a secondary region.

117
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:28,039
If there is an outage, your
workloads are already synchronized

118
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:30,399
and ready to run in another region.

119
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:36,879
In the event of failure, planned
maintenance, or a disaster,

120
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:41,809
you can failover to a secondary
region with minimal disruptions.

121
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:48,349
ESR automates this process, ensuring
quick and smooth transition.

122
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:55,309
Once a primary region is restored, you
can fail back to your original environment

123
00:09:55,309 --> 00:10:01,109
seamlessly, ensuring normal business
operation with minimal data loss.

124
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:06,489
Now let's look at what all the
components are required to set

125
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:08,909
up the Azure to Azure scenario.

126
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:12,889
To set up Azure to Azure
disaster recovery, you need

127
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:15,059
the following key components.

128
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:21,889
The VMs running in primary region
that needs to be replicated to your

129
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:24,249
disaster recovery target region.

130
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:28,809
Now, we need the recovery vault.

131
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:36,009
The Recovery Vault, where Azure
Site Recovery stores metadata,

132
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:41,889
configuration details for a
replication, failover, and failback.

133
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:44,869
And now we need a replication policy.

134
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:52,599
This defines how often data is replicated
and retention of recovery points.

135
00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:54,029
This helps.

136
00:10:54,564 --> 00:10:58,784
Ensure that you meet your
recovery point objective.

137
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:00,234
That means RPO.

138
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:06,364
You need a target region, the secondary
region where your VMs will be replicated.

139
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:11,344
Microsoft provides paired regions
to ensure optimal disaster recovery.

140
00:11:11,844 --> 00:11:17,284
And then you need network
configuration, especially VNet in

141
00:11:17,284 --> 00:11:21,964
the target region to connect the
recovered VMs after a failover.

142
00:11:22,674 --> 00:11:27,234
You need a subnet that mirrors
your primary region setup.

143
00:11:27,964 --> 00:11:34,404
If you have a public IP, then you need to,
you need a connectivity after a failover.

144
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:41,274
So replication policy and recovery
plans replication settings to define

145
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:45,844
a frequency and consistency of the
replication and recovery plans.

146
00:11:46,229 --> 00:11:51,029
to automate the sequence of failure
operations, including dependencies

147
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:52,719
between the applications.

148
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:58,639
Say, for example, if you have a, three
tiered application, like Tier 1, Tier

149
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:04,779
2, and Tier 3, whenever you are doing
The fellow from one region to another

150
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:11,899
region, you need to ensure that first
your active directory environment comes

151
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:17,239
in, then your database databases comes
online, and then your web application

152
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,409
comes online to, automate that process.

153
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:21,979
You can use the recovery.

154
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:24,579
Then you need a managed disk.

155
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:29,649
ASR supports managed disk, eliminating
the need to manage the storage accounts.

156
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:38,879
For enhanced performance, ASR replicates
data to a storage blob before writing into

157
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,929
the managed disk in the target region.

158
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:45,269
You also need Azure Automation
account, which is optional.

159
00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:48,019
If needed, you can use the automation.

160
00:12:48,664 --> 00:12:54,394
To run the runbooks to trigger custom
script during failover or Failback.

161
00:12:54,894 --> 00:12:59,544
Since we already covered Azure to
Azure scenario, now let's shift our

162
00:12:59,544 --> 00:13:05,014
focus to how Azure site recovery
helps to protect workloads running on

163
00:13:05,014 --> 00:13:07,924
Hyper V by replicating them to Azure.

164
00:13:08,404 --> 00:13:09,454
Many organizations.

165
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:15,169
still rely on premises infrastructure,
including Hyper V virtual machines.

166
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:21,019
While this setup provides a control
and flexibility, it also presents

167
00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:24,269
challenges in terms of disaster recovery.

168
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:30,864
If an on premises data center
experience a failure, whether due to

169
00:13:30,864 --> 00:13:36,439
hardware issues, natural disasters,
cyberattacks, organizations, need a

170
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:42,109
way to quickly recover their workloads
in the cloud to minimize downtime.

171
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:44,929
This is where ASR comes in.

172
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:46,509
How it works?

173
00:13:46,689 --> 00:13:51,579
ASR continuously replicates
Hyper V virtual machines from on

174
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:54,279
premises environment to Azure.

175
00:13:54,779 --> 00:14:00,229
This ensures that up to date
Copies of your workloads are

176
00:14:00,249 --> 00:14:02,319
always available in the cloud.

177
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:09,759
If a disruption in a primary
environment allows ASR to failover

178
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:15,089
to Azure, instantly bringing your
critical application back online.

179
00:14:15,609 --> 00:14:21,139
Once your environment is restored, You
can fail back workloads from Azure to

180
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:26,869
Hyper V infrastructure, returning to a
normal operation with minimal data loss.

181
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:32,369
What components are required to
successfully configure Hyper V to Azure?

182
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:34,599
You will need the following components.

183
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,209
The on premises Hyper V host.

184
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,949
The Hyper V service hosting
the virtual machines.

185
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:42,624
That need a protections.

186
00:14:43,154 --> 00:14:49,524
ESR supports both standalone Hyper
V host, Hyper V clusters managed by

187
00:14:49,544 --> 00:14:51,544
System Center Virtual Machine Manager.

188
00:14:51,984 --> 00:14:52,684
We call it SCVMM.

189
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:58,232
Then we need a recovery vault as we
talked in Azure to Azure scenario.

190
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:02,664
Vault stores all the replication
and recovery settings.

191
00:15:02,874 --> 00:15:08,824
These are the core component that manages
failover, failback, and recovery plan.

192
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:08,984
Thank you for listening.

193
00:15:09,484 --> 00:15:12,324
Then we need ASR provider and agent.

194
00:15:12,324 --> 00:15:17,774
If you are using SCVMM, you need
to install the ASR provider on

195
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:22,994
the VMM server, and if you are
using the standalone Hyper V host,

196
00:15:23,394 --> 00:15:29,329
then install the ASR provider And
the agent on the Hyper V host.

197
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:35,439
The replication policy defines how
frequently data is replicated and how

198
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:38,109
many recovery points are retained.

199
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:40,469
This determines your RPO.

200
00:15:40,969 --> 00:15:42,134
Then the, you need a RPO.

201
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:49,294
Azure target resources like managed
disks, VNet, and recovery plans if you

202
00:15:49,294 --> 00:15:53,924
wanted to, automate some of these tasks.

203
00:15:54,424 --> 00:15:58,204
We have already covered Azure
to Azure, Hyper V to Azure.

204
00:15:58,349 --> 00:16:02,859
Now we are going to cover VMware
to Azure or Physical to Azure.

205
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:07,149
we have two versions of, VMware
to Azure or Physical to Azure.

206
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:09,849
one is classic and one is modernized.

207
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:13,639
classic is going to be deprecated
soon, so I'll not be talking that.

208
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:18,969
So now we are going to talk about
modernized approach to VMware or

209
00:16:18,969 --> 00:16:20,839
a Physical to Azure site recovery.

210
00:16:21,469 --> 00:16:28,289
Let's talk about how ASR helps to protect
VMware virtual machines and physical

211
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:30,939
servers by replicating them to Azure.

212
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,439
Many organizations still run critical
workloads on VMware environments

213
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:41,709
or on physical servers, whether
it is in their data center or

214
00:16:41,969 --> 00:16:43,559
in a co location facilities.

215
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:49,259
While the setup offers control,
it also introduces challenges.

216
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:54,989
Scalability, cost, maintenance, and
most importantly, a disaster recovery.

217
00:16:54,989 --> 00:17:01,319
Traditional recovery methods like
secondary data centers, tape backups,

218
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:06,899
manual failover processes are
often slow, expensive, and complex.

219
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:12,799
This is where Azure Site Recovery
modernizes the disaster recovery,

220
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:17,619
providing Cloud first automated
and cost effective solution.

221
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:19,209
How it works?

222
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:25,049
ASR continuously replicates VMware
virtual machines or a physical service to

223
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:31,579
Azure, ensuring near real time protection
without impacting the performance.

224
00:17:32,569 --> 00:17:36,959
If an outage occurs, whether it's
a hardware failure, cyber attack

225
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:42,689
or natural disaster, you can fail
over workloads to Azure instantly.

226
00:17:43,064 --> 00:17:46,484
Restoring services with
minimal disruption.

227
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:52,524
Once your on premises environment
is back online, you can fill back

228
00:17:52,554 --> 00:18:00,474
workloads from Azure to Azure, sorry,
Azure to your VMware environment.

229
00:18:00,554 --> 00:18:04,539
If it is physical to Azure,
Then you'll not be able to

230
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:07,069
fail back to physical servers.

231
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:12,859
In that case, you need to live in
Azure or you need to have an alternate

232
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:15,409
fail back with VMware option.

233
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:21,284
Now let's look at the key
components involved in VMware

234
00:18:21,284 --> 00:18:22,729
to Azure or physical to Azure.

235
00:18:23,454 --> 00:18:27,774
To set up VMware or physical to
Azure Site Recovery, you need

236
00:18:27,784 --> 00:18:29,634
the following key components.

237
00:18:30,174 --> 00:18:33,344
On premises VMware or physical servers.

238
00:18:33,664 --> 00:18:37,454
These are the workloads
that need the protections.

239
00:18:38,094 --> 00:18:45,249
Then we need, as usual, Azure That's
the heart of ASR, managing replication,

240
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,349
failover, failback, compliance settings.

241
00:18:48,489 --> 00:18:51,639
All metadata will be stored
in Recovery Service Vault.

242
00:18:52,389 --> 00:18:57,409
Then, in on premises, we need a
replication appliance, which can

243
00:18:57,409 --> 00:19:00,589
be installed on Windows Server.

244
00:19:00,824 --> 00:19:06,914
to handle data replication between
VMware or a physical servers to Azure.

245
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:14,484
And this appliance connects to a VMware
vCenter or a standalone ESX host to

246
00:19:14,484 --> 00:19:20,464
replicate the VMs and manages replication
of a physical servers to Azure.

247
00:19:21,354 --> 00:19:27,854
Then we need a mobility service or
mobility agent which will be directly

248
00:19:27,854 --> 00:19:33,784
installed on a VMware machine or a
physical server To enable real time

249
00:19:33,784 --> 00:19:39,474
replication to Azure in our target
Azure Resources, we need a vnet.

250
00:19:39,534 --> 00:19:44,284
Once you fill out the vm, we
need a vnet to connect, and

251
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:46,054
then we need a managed disk.

252
00:19:46,404 --> 00:19:53,694
ESR replicates workloads to these disks
for ENT storage and faster recovery.

253
00:19:54,574 --> 00:19:55,984
Azure virtual machines.

254
00:19:56,484 --> 00:20:02,534
Once fail happens, VMs are automatically
provisions based on the replicated data.

255
00:20:03,194 --> 00:20:04,094
Then we need.

256
00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:12,059
Replication policy and recovery plans,
which replication policy defines the

257
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:19,579
recovery point objective to ensure minimal
data loss and recovery plans, which helps

258
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:26,389
you to orchestrate the failure with the
recovery plans, brings services online.

259
00:20:26,764 --> 00:20:29,004
in the right sequence.

260
00:20:29,504 --> 00:20:34,694
Now we'll take a look at key
success factors pre implementation.

261
00:20:35,264 --> 00:20:40,764
Successfully implementing Azure Site
Recovery requires careful planning,

262
00:20:41,424 --> 00:20:43,484
training, and continuous testing.

263
00:20:44,014 --> 00:20:49,064
A well prepared approach ensures
seamless disaster recovery and

264
00:20:49,404 --> 00:20:51,894
minimizes operational disruptions.

265
00:20:52,774 --> 00:20:54,024
Comprehensive planning.

266
00:20:54,449 --> 00:21:01,599
Before deploying ASR, it's critical,
it's crucial to conduct thorough testing,

267
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:06,759
thorough assessment of your infrastructure
to ensure a smooth transition.

268
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:15,129
Key considerations includes infrastructure
readiness, analyze on premises and cloud

269
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:20,634
workloads to determine replication needs,
network capacity, Thank you for listening.

270
00:21:21,144 --> 00:21:26,014
Evaluate bandwidth requirements
to prevent latency issues.

271
00:21:26,894 --> 00:21:28,364
Compliance and security.

272
00:21:28,474 --> 00:21:34,664
Map out industry regulations to
ensure your disaster recovery setup

273
00:21:34,904 --> 00:21:37,034
meets the government's requirements.

274
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,364
Implementation and roadmap.

275
00:21:39,774 --> 00:21:44,434
Define a structured A rollout plan
tailored to your organization need

276
00:21:44,934 --> 00:21:50,444
through training ensure it teams
are equipped with right skills and

277
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:56,934
certifications in Azure disaster recovery
best practices and ESR management

278
00:21:57,434 --> 00:22:00,204
cloud hands on training to familiarize.

279
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:05,269
Teams with failover and failback
procedures, troubleshooting,

280
00:22:05,609 --> 00:22:08,389
and automation workflows.

281
00:22:08,989 --> 00:22:14,109
Provide ongoing learning opportunities
such as Microsoft Learning Modules

282
00:22:14,109 --> 00:22:17,879
and real world lab environments.

283
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:19,659
Regular testing.

284
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:22,199
Schedule monthly failover drills.

285
00:22:22,404 --> 00:22:25,354
To validate workloads are resilient.

286
00:22:26,354 --> 00:22:31,774
Conduct quarterly full scale
recovery simulations to assess

287
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:34,274
overall disaster recovery readiness.

288
00:22:34,774 --> 00:22:36,724
Monitor system performance.

289

9 recovery reliability and proactively
resolve potentially potential issues.

291
00:22:47,614 --> 00:22:52,954
Now let's look at a step by step guide
to implementing Azure Site Recovery.

292
00:22:53,454 --> 00:23:00,104
In the assessment phase, if you are using
VMware to Azure or Hyper V to Azure,

293
00:23:00,534 --> 00:23:03,454
Microsoft provides a deployment tool.

294
00:23:03,874 --> 00:23:05,254
You can use it.

295
00:23:05,334 --> 00:23:06,934
We call it a deployment planner.

296
00:23:07,274 --> 00:23:11,294
You can run that tool for
a week on your environment.

297
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:17,954
To understand your workload dependencies,
network performance, business continuity

298
00:23:17,984 --> 00:23:23,934
requirements, and, recovery time objective
and recovery point objective to align

00:23:49,084 --> 00:23:52,664
minimize manual intervention.

306
00:23:53,164 --> 00:23:59,384
How you can do the deployment, set
up a recovery vault and configure

307
00:23:59,384 --> 00:24:06,164
replication policies, enable source to
target VM replication with continuous

308
00:24:06,164 --> 00:24:12,004
monitoring, and automate failover and
failback processes for seamless recovery.

309
00:24:12,504 --> 00:24:13,974

310
00:24:14,254 --> 00:24:19,304
Conduct bi monthly failover drills
to measure recovery speed and

311
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:21,354
validate failover configurations.

312
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:26,304
Analyze performance metrics to
refine disaster recovery procedures.

313
00:24:27,024 --> 00:24:33,484
Update recovery plans regularly based
on insights from real world testing.

314
00:24:33,984 --> 00:24:37,994
Conclusion, strengthen the business
continuity with Azure Site Recovery.

315
00:24:38,214 --> 00:24:43,274
At the end of the day, business
continuity is all about resilience.

316
00:24:43,924 --> 00:24:49,474
Being able to recover quickly, minimize
disruptions, and keep operations

00:24:49,924 --> 00:24:52,834
running smoothly no matter what happens.

318
00:24:53,194 --> 00:25:00,044
Azure Site Recovery makes it possible by
providing fast, cost effective, and highly

319
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:02,454
reliable disaster recovery solution.

320
00:25:03,254 --> 00:25:11,129
With recovery, Times up to 90 percent
faster and cost savings between 40 to 60%.

321
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:15,709
ESR eliminates the need
of expensive secondary

322
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:19,869
infrastructure while ensuring 99.

323
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:21,849
9 recovery success rates.

324
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:28,449
Beyond just efficiency and cost savings,
security and compliance are built in.

325
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:33,864
Giving organizations a peace of
mind, their critical workloads
