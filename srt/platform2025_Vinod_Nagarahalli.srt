1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,130
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:01,309 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm, and I'm excited to be
here to discuss a topic that's

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,080
transforming our business operate.

4
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:12,520
The topic is modern ERP as the platform
backbone for AI driven supply chain.

5
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:18,369
So we are living in an era where supply
chains are no longer linear their dynamic.

6
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:23,909
Interconnected ecosystems driven
by data, AI promises to revolution,

7
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:28,109
revolutionize, supply chain planning,
execution, and responsiveness.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,440
But there's a catch.

9
00:00:29,889 --> 00:00:33,790
Most enterprises are still running
on outdated ERP systems that

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,110
were not built for the future.

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,879
Today's enterprises phase a
critical inflection point.

12
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,030
On one side we have exponential
growth in ai, machine learning,

13
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,699
IOT, and predictive analytics.

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,205
On the other hand, we have legacy
RP systems, which are rigid, siloed

15
00:00:50,614 --> 00:00:54,355
and are not designed for real
time AI power decision making.

16
00:00:54,855 --> 00:01:00,355
This mismatch creates inefficiencies
like data silos, delayed

17
00:01:00,355 --> 00:01:04,495
visibility, and an inability to
respond to disruptions quickly.

18
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:10,645
The traditional ERP systems were
built for transaction processing

19
00:01:10,825 --> 00:01:12,415
and not for intelligence.

20
00:01:12,994 --> 00:01:15,875
They're like Ivy built for
cars, but now we are trying

21
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,104
to run I speed trains on them.

22
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:22,914
Without modern ERP platforms that
integrate AI natively, businesses risk

23
00:01:23,095 --> 00:01:28,735
falling beyond competitors who can
sense, predict, and respond much faster.

24
00:01:28,985 --> 00:01:34,805
In this session I will share why modern
ERP must serve as backbone for AI driven

25
00:01:34,805 --> 00:01:40,895
supply chains and how organizations can
transform from reactive, siloed operations

26
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:43,895
to truly intelligent, connected networks.

27
00:01:44,565 --> 00:01:49,184
We'll also explore what makes an
ERP already with real world use

28
00:01:49,184 --> 00:01:53,785
cases and how companies can future
proof the supply chain platforms.

29
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:54,585
All right.

30
00:01:54,884 --> 00:01:59,204
So now that we've set the stage
for why AI driven supply chains are

31
00:01:59,204 --> 00:02:03,515
critical let's address the elephant
in the room which is our existing

32
00:02:03,575 --> 00:02:05,945
ERP systems are holding us back.

33
00:02:06,495 --> 00:02:12,555
The promise of AI can only be realized if
the foundational systems can support it.

34
00:02:13,105 --> 00:02:18,775
And legacy ERP systems simply
were not built for this new world.

35
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:19,424
First.

36
00:02:20,035 --> 00:02:23,155
Legacy RP implementations
are highly fragmented.

37
00:02:23,785 --> 00:02:28,859
Over years of customization and
bolt on solutions, enterprises have

38
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:33,149
ended up with disconnected processes
across planning, logistics, asset

39
00:02:33,149 --> 00:02:36,540
management, hr, finance, and sourcing.

40
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:40,200
And this fragmentation creates data silos.

41
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:44,265
Where critical information is
locked in isolated systems leading

42
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:48,855
to delays in decision making,
duplicated efforts, and an inability

43
00:02:48,855 --> 00:02:51,165
to respond quickly to disruptions.

44
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:57,805
Second data, which is the life
blood of AI, is often not ai.

45
00:02:57,805 --> 00:03:01,815
Already in this systems ERPs may
hold vast amount of structured and

46
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:07,665
unstructured data, but much of it is
incomplete, inconsistent, and siloed.

47
00:03:07,965 --> 00:03:14,325
AI models thrive on clean, standardized,
and integrated data across functions

48
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:17,605
like supply chain finance, hr, et cetera.

49
00:03:18,505 --> 00:03:23,245
Without this, AI initiatives fail
to deliver meaningful insights.

50
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:28,999
The third reason is the rigid
architecture of legacy ERP, which

51
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:33,479
makes it extremely challenging to
integrate with modern technologies be it

52
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:38,829
cloud-based platforms, machine learning
framework, or emerging capabilities

53
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:41,259
like digital twins and generative ai.

54
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,179
This lack of flexibility means
every integration becomes a

55
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:51,099
costly, time consuming project
rather than a seamless capability.

56
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:58,369
This limitations of fragmentation,
poor data readiness rigidity are why

57
00:03:58,369 --> 00:04:02,689
companies struggle to unlock the full
potential of AI in the supply chains.

58
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:09,080
The good news, paradigm is emerging
ERP modernization, guided by

59
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,490
platform engineering principle,
and that's what we'll explore next.

60
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,490
So how do we how do we
overcome the limitation of

61
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,620
legacy ERP we just discussed?

62
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:25,980
The answer lies in rethinking ERP
not as a monolithic application, but

63
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,695
as platform engineer for agility,
scalability, and intelligence.

64
00:04:31,215 --> 00:04:33,870
This is where platform
engineering principles.

65
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,400
Come into play transforming ERP
into flexible foundation, capable of

66
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,680
supporting AI driven supply chain.

67
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,430
Platform engineering focuses on
building scalable and maintainable

68
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:53,530
technology ecosystems by treating
systems as a set of interoperable

69
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,320
services rather than one rigid block.

70
00:04:57,049 --> 00:05:01,919
When applied to the enterprise resource
planning applications, it allows us to

71
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,030
break down the traditional structure
into modular composable pieces.

72
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,849
That can evolve independently
and integrate seamlessly

73
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:13,229
with emerging technologies.

74
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:18,129
The key tenants of platform
engineering approach are microservice

75
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:23,679
architecture, A PFS design, even
driven architecture microservice

76
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:29,200
architecture instead of a single
tightly coupled system, functionality

77
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,570
is de delivered through microservices.

78
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,370
Self-contained modules, for
example, finance, procurement,

79
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,830
planning, logistics, et cetera.

80
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,849
This gives organizations unprecedented
flexibility to scale specific

81
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:50,489
capability rollout updates faster,
and adopt innovations without

82
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,140
disrupting the entire system.

83
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:55,124
Second is the a p first design.

84
00:05:55,374 --> 00:06:02,244
API APIs are the glue that ensures
all ERP functionality is easily

85
00:06:02,244 --> 00:06:07,574
accessible and integrate with other
company or other enterprise systems,

86
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:12,560
be it external partners or internal
partners and also AI solutions.

87
00:06:13,465 --> 00:06:18,055
A well documented version,
API strategy, future proofs

88
00:06:18,055 --> 00:06:21,835
the ERP and enables continuous
integration of new capabilities.

89
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:28,594
Last but not least, the event driven
architecture which moving away from

90
00:06:28,594 --> 00:06:33,130
Batch Pro, batch based processes
to even driven architecture.

91
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,930
Which means real time responsiveness
inventory update, demand

92
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:43,370
signals disruption are processed
instantly enabling predictive and

93
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,380
adaptive supply chain operations.

94
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:51,220
By adapting this platform, engineering
principles, microservices, APIs,

95
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,260
and even driven architecture, we
create an ERP foundation that.

96
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:59,535
That is no longer a barrier
to innovation but a launchpad

97
00:06:59,535 --> 00:07:01,635
for AI driven transformation.

98
00:07:02,135 --> 00:07:03,640
Okay, let's move to the next slide.

99
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,470
Awesome.

100
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,880
So we've seen our platform's energy
platform engineering transforms ERP

101
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,920
into a flexible modern platform.

102
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,300
But flexibility alone is not enough to
truly enable AI driven supply chain.

103
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,620
We need unity.

104
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:25,715
A unified ERP architecture that
breaks down silos across enterprise.

105
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:29,645
Legacy ERP systems operate
as isolated modules.

106
00:07:30,145 --> 00:07:33,655
Whereas modern Unified ERP
architecture treats every part

107
00:07:33,655 --> 00:07:36,974
of the business like planning,
logistics, sourcing finance, asset

108
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:43,364
management as intercon interconnected
components of a single ecosystem.

109
00:07:44,094 --> 00:07:48,239
This shift lays the foundation
for AI because AI needs holistic

110
00:07:48,549 --> 00:07:51,239
real time data to be effective.

111
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:57,439
End-to-end visibility with unified
ERP gain real time access to

112
00:07:57,489 --> 00:07:59,349
data across the value chain.

113
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,879
This means decisions are informed by
what's happening right now, not by

114
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,129
outdated reports or delayed updates.

115
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:10,729
Processes processes no
longer operate in isolation.

116
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:14,159
For example, maintenance scheduling
can automatically factor in

117
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:18,729
production plans, inventory levels and
transportation constraints, enabling

118
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:24,079
crew optimized operations unified ERP
enforces consistent end-to-end process

119
00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:26,319
across the enterprise where it's.

120
00:08:26,944 --> 00:08:29,824
Planning, sourcing, or asset management.

121
00:08:30,364 --> 00:08:34,504
Everyone follows the same best
practices guidelines removing

122
00:08:34,504 --> 00:08:36,874
inefficiencies and inconsistencies.

123
00:08:37,774 --> 00:08:43,884
Finally, unified, ERP establishes
common data model and governance

124
00:08:44,704 --> 00:08:50,744
policies across the enterprise with
thereby reducing the data quality

125
00:08:50,744 --> 00:08:53,394
issues that undermine AI initiatives.

126
00:08:53,694 --> 00:08:59,634
Clean, standardized data, as we know, is
the bedrock of trustworthy AI insights.

127
00:09:00,134 --> 00:09:04,004
Breaking down silos through
unified ERP architecture

128
00:09:04,034 --> 00:09:05,774
doesn't just improve efficiency.

129
00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:10,234
It what it is what makes AI in
supply chain truly positive.

130
00:09:11,054 --> 00:09:16,844
And so next we'll see how this unified
platform enables for intelligent,

131
00:09:16,964 --> 00:09:20,394
autonomous, and decision making at scale.

132
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:22,734
Okay, next slide.

133
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:28,805
Alright, so as we saw that unified ERP
architecture breaks down silos internally

134
00:09:29,395 --> 00:09:32,645
but it truly unlocks air driven value air.

135
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,780
Now for that ERP must also
integrate seamlessly with the

136
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,520
broader enterprise ecosystem.

137
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:43,520
This is where in, integration excellence
becomes the key differentiator.

138
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:49,140
Modern ERP can no longer operate
in silos or as an island.

139
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,650
AI thrives on compressive.

140
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,890
Connected data flow from
shop floor operations to

141
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,300
strategic financial planning.

142
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:03,740
This means moving beyond simple point to
point connections to a deeply integrated,

143
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,090
intelligent operational network.

144
00:10:06,495 --> 00:10:11,055
The core integration pillars
in any, in a new era, ERP, like

145
00:10:11,055 --> 00:10:13,425
S four is the core backbone.

146
00:10:13,605 --> 00:10:19,385
Then on top of that, you have advanced
modules like Ariba, extended warehouse

147
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:23,635
management, transportation management,
integrated business planning, the

148
00:10:23,635 --> 00:10:29,185
financial supply chain management,
which use the end-to-end visibility.

149
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,720
To the entire supply chain and beyond.

150
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:36,440
And then you have systems like Teamcenter,
which are used for product lifecycle

151
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:44,010
management MES systems like camstar or
LIMS systems like Lab Vantage, which play

152
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:49,450
a pivotal role in each of their specific
areas, but come together in terms of

153
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,040
a comprehensive connected data flow.

154
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,280
When ERP becomes this deep, deeply
integrated up, it transforms from a system

155
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,260
of record into a system of intelligence
powering predictive analy analytics,

156
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,700
automated decision making and AI driven
optimization across the enterprise.

157
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:12,140
So the key here is the integration
excellence and how do we achieve that.

158
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:12,820
Great.

159
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,695
Go to the next slide.

160
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:20,525
Alright, so let's look at some of the
examples of of how we can leverage ai.

161
00:11:20,935 --> 00:11:24,985
So far we have talked about building the
foundation of AI driven supply chain.

162
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:29,735
Now let's look at one of the most
powerful real world applications of this

163
00:11:29,735 --> 00:11:32,145
approach which is predictive maintenance.

164
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:39,890
This is where the modern ERP IO
OT and AI converge to deliver

165
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,600
a tangible business value.

166
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:48,125
As you, as you all know, equipment
failures are costly unplanned downtime

167
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:54,035
can all production, can dealer shipments
and essentially erode customer trust.

168
00:11:54,935 --> 00:11:57,455
Predictive maintenance flips the script.

169
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:03,650
Instead of reacting to breakdowns,
companies can actually predict

170
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:07,850
and prevent them using AI
driven insights and algorithms.

171
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:13,010
IOT sensors IOT sensor
network embedded in machines.

172
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:18,440
Feed, continuous stream of data
about the equipment be it the

173
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,135
temperature, vibration, pressure,
and, and many more attributes.

174
00:12:23,835 --> 00:12:26,655
Modern ERP systems aggregate and.

175
00:12:26,735 --> 00:12:31,205
Con contextualize this data, making
it actionable across the enterprise.

176
00:12:31,755 --> 00:12:36,735
On top of that, the machine learning
algorithm are able to detect

177
00:12:36,795 --> 00:12:41,415
subtle patterns and anomalies
early signs of way or failure

178
00:12:41,415 --> 00:12:43,425
that human operators might miss.

179
00:12:43,995 --> 00:12:49,365
These insights are not just descriptive,
they're predictive, anticipating

180
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:51,105
problems even before they occur.

181
00:12:51,965 --> 00:12:55,175
With AI generated early
warnings, maintenance.

182
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:59,410
Maintenance teams can schedule
repair during planned downtime.

183
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,710
Order parts spare parts in advance
and eliminate costly surprises.

184
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,130
This moves organizations
from reactive fighting.

185
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,180
Two proactive.

186
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,710
I think the results are very compelling.

187
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,920
Reduced downtime, lower maintenance
cost, improved asset longevity.

188
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,530
And I have customer satisfaction.

189
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:26,030
This is just one example of a modern
ERP As an AI enabled platform backbone

190
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,700
delivers real competitive advantage.

191
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,950
Okay, let's look at another example.

192
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,950
As predictive maintenance showed
us how AI and RP transformation

193
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,660
operations on the supply side.

194
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,760
Now let's look at the demand side.

195
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,980
AI driven demand forecasting one
of the most impactful applications

196
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,690
of AI and supply chain management.

197
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,770
Accurate demand forecasting has
always been the holy grail for

198
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:56,670
supply chain practitioners and AI
is finally making it a reality.

199
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,280
Traditional forecasting methods
struggle with volatility, limited

200
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,780
data inputs, and the need and the
need for constant manual adjustments.

201
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,070
Ai can overcome these limitations
by leveraging massive data sets,

202
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,650
self learning algorithms and
advanced scenario modeling all

203
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,990
enabled by modern EIP foundation.

204
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:25,260
The modern AI algorithm tap into vast
data sets for multiple sources be it

205
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:31,380
sales history market trends, social
sentiments, weather patterns even IOT

206
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,860
data to uncover even patterns that
traditional methods cannot detect.

207
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,370
Unlike static models
that degrade over time.

208
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,330
Yeah.

209
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,400
Algorithm learn continuously.

210
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:48,420
They are just dynamically as data flows
in ensuring forecasting remain accurate

211
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,610
without constant human intervention.

212
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:55,140
AI also empowers organization
with what if capabilities.

213
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:59,740
It can generate multiple forecast
scenarios, helping business plan for

214
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,700
uncertainties like demand, surge,
supply, disruptions, and market share.

215
00:15:04,535 --> 00:15:09,475
The result it's it's reduced
stockouts, lower inventory costs

216
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:14,705
fast, faster response to market
changes, and a significant competitive

217
00:15:14,985 --> 00:15:17,685
advantage edge over others.

218
00:15:18,525 --> 00:15:23,095
This is our modern ERP enables
business to move from guess from

219
00:15:23,095 --> 00:15:27,665
guesswork to precision forecasting
fueling resilience and profitability.

220
00:15:28,165 --> 00:15:29,990
Okay, let's move to the next slide.

221
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:35,470
Alright, so we saw at AWA Transforms
operations and forecasting, let's.

222
00:15:36,295 --> 00:15:41,805
Now let's address another critical
area where modern E-L-P-N-A AI converge

223
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,525
contracts management and risk mitigation.

224
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:49,370
This is the area where natural
language processing or NLP.

225
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,645
Is making a real impact.

226
00:15:52,255 --> 00:15:55,045
Contracts are the backbone
of business relationships.

227
00:15:55,075 --> 00:15:59,410
We all know that covering everything
from supplier agreement to customer

228
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,330
agreement, to compliance requirements.

229
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:04,960
But in many enterprises, many
companies, contracts are still

230
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:10,205
unstructured, manual and very
disconnected from operations and NLP.

231
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:16,760
Changes that by turning contracts into
actionable intelligence NLP capabilities

232
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:22,860
can can automatically extract and
analyze key details from every contract.

233
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:26,020
Like payment terms, what
are my delivery obligations?

234
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,975
What are the compliance clause
and many more items like that.

235
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:33,815
Essentially eliminating manual
reviews and reducing errors.

236
00:16:34,315 --> 00:16:35,965
Machine learning algorithms.

237
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:41,350
Can scan thousands of contracts to
identify hidden risks, such as unfavorable

238
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:47,120
terms concentration of exposures or
patterns that could lead to disputes.

239
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:51,440
This proactive insight allows
companies to mitigate risk before

240
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,260
it becomes expensive and costly.

241
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,615
When integrated with ERP systems, this
contract intelligence don't just sit.

242
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:02,665
In the legal side or the legal
department, it treats directly

243
00:17:02,665 --> 00:17:04,615
into operational decisions.

244
00:17:04,865 --> 00:17:08,555
One of the examples that I've seen
is a supplier, when they miss a

245
00:17:08,555 --> 00:17:12,995
critical delivery obligation, ERP
can automatically adjust production

246
00:17:12,995 --> 00:17:15,185
plans or trigger alternative sourcing.

247
00:17:15,885 --> 00:17:20,745
By inputing, NLP, forward contract
intelligence into ERP organizations

248
00:17:20,745 --> 00:17:25,420
gain better compliance, reduced risk,
and faster smarter decision making.

249
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:30,190
This is another step towards making
ERP not just a system of record,

250
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,920
but a system of intelligence, right?

251
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,080
So let's move to the next one.

252
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:35,850
Okay.

253
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:36,750
Forward looking vision.

254
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:43,010
So we've explored our modern ERP supports,
today's AI driven supply chain needs.

255
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,340
But what's next?

256
00:17:44,645 --> 00:17:46,385
Where is this journey heading?

257
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,875
The future of ERP is not
just a transactional system.

258
00:17:49,975 --> 00:17:55,045
It's becoming the launch path for
enterprise wide AI innovation.

259
00:17:55,345 --> 00:17:59,505
The shift from traditional
back office ERP to AI enabled

260
00:17:59,505 --> 00:18:01,365
platform is more than an upgrade.

261
00:18:01,435 --> 00:18:02,545
It's a paradigm shift.

262
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:08,035
ERP will be the no center of the
no center for AI driven decision

263
00:18:08,035 --> 00:18:09,835
making across the enterprise.

264
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,535
LA large language ma models.

265
00:18:12,915 --> 00:18:18,235
The n the LLMs will enhance nearly
every happy process from customer

266
00:18:18,235 --> 00:18:23,065
service chat bots that under understand
complex inquiries to air driven

267
00:18:23,065 --> 00:18:25,365
procurement to autonomous planning.

268
00:18:25,915 --> 00:18:31,725
This brings intelligence to every
interaction that we know of digital twin.

269
00:18:32,225 --> 00:18:37,320
The digital twins of entire supply
chains will provide real time virtual

270
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,870
models of operations powered by the
data foundation, ERP System Delivery.

271
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,640
This allows company to simulate
and optimize operations before

272
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,320
making decision in the real world.

273
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,090
ERP systems will increase.

274
00:18:51,795 --> 00:18:56,745
Will increasingly annual routine
decisions automatically like inventory

275
00:18:56,745 --> 00:19:01,385
replenishment your supply selection,
your production scheduling which

276
00:19:01,385 --> 00:19:06,015
will free human experts to focus on
strategy and more on the innovation

277
00:19:06,165 --> 00:19:09,010
side of things with edge computing.

278
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:09,420
ERP.

279
00:19:10,035 --> 00:19:15,185
Connected systems will process and execute
decisions at the point of action while

280
00:19:15,185 --> 00:19:20,435
staying synchronized with the core ERP
enabling instant distributed intelligence.

281
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:27,025
The evolution of ERP into an AI platform
backbone is not a distant intuition.

282
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:27,865
It's happening now.

283
00:19:28,445 --> 00:19:32,425
Organizations that embrace the
shift will lead in resilience,

284
00:19:32,455 --> 00:19:34,375
inefficiency, and innovation.

285
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,590
The, probably the question for all
of us is are we ready to make ERP

286
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,360
the foundation of our AI future?

287
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,720
Alright, so let's look at
implementation strategies.

288
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:51,300
So we, we've seen the vision
of ERP as an AI launch pack.

289
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,550
But how do we actually get there?

290
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:57,990
This transformation requires
disciplined strategic approach,

291
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,470
and that's where the implement
implementation strategies come in.

292
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:08,800
Implementing an AI Ready ERP platform
isn't just a technology project, it's a,

293
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:16,200
it is a business transformation success
depends on aligning data architecture

294
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,660
people, and the business value.

295
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,430
Everything starts with clean,
consistent consistent and governed data.

296
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:30,340
Without a trusted data foundation, AI
will fail to deliver accurate insights.

297
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:35,530
First thing, first, establish data
quality standards, ownership and

298
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:38,050
governance policy from the outset.

299
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,510
Avoid the trap of trying
to boil the ocean.

300
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,870
Focusing on specific business
domains like planning, logistics, or

301
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:51,260
maintenance when made modernization
will have the highest impact.

302
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:55,660
This approach delivers quick
win while bundling and building

303
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,710
momentum for broader transformation.

304
00:20:59,415 --> 00:21:04,275
Balance innovation with stability,
use cutting edge technologies like

305
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:11,015
microservices and APIs, but ensure they
instantly and and seamlessly integrate

306
00:21:11,075 --> 00:21:13,055
with proven enterprise grade systems.

307
00:21:13,975 --> 00:21:16,180
Last technology won't succeed.

308
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,430
Without people invest in skill
development have a stakeholder

309
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:26,960
buy-in and be ready for the cultural
readiness for AI enabled operations.

310
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:32,355
And finally deliver tangible
business value early and of and often

311
00:21:32,985 --> 00:21:36,555
identify use cases that generate
measurable return on investments.

312
00:21:36,705 --> 00:21:42,425
This builds the, this builds the executive
support and funds further innovation.

313
00:21:42,725 --> 00:21:43,835
Let's move to the next slide.

314
00:21:44,335 --> 00:21:44,635
Alright.

315
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:47,605
Now that we have covered
implementation strategies,

316
00:21:47,665 --> 00:21:51,595
let's look at the architectural
foundation that makes modern ERP.

317
00:21:52,135 --> 00:21:55,505
Truly adaptive composable architecture
with the API first design.

318
00:21:56,235 --> 00:22:01,095
This is the shift from rigid
monolithic ERP system to flexible,

319
00:22:01,185 --> 00:22:06,625
more modular platform that can
evolve as business need changes in

320
00:22:06,685 --> 00:22:08,880
today's dynamic environment business.

321
00:22:09,165 --> 00:22:12,105
Requirements change now very rapidly.

322
00:22:12,755 --> 00:22:15,395
Traditional ERP upgrades can keep up.

323
00:22:15,425 --> 00:22:19,055
They're too slow, they're too expensive,
too costly, and too disruptive.

324
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:24,125
A composable architecture enables
companies to build, to evolve

325
00:22:24,215 --> 00:22:28,425
and integrate capabilities on
demand without being constrained

326
00:22:28,425 --> 00:22:30,165
by a single inflexible system.

327
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:35,215
The core principle of the composable
ERPR, the modular component,

328
00:22:35,335 --> 00:22:39,595
the microservices, a PF first
design, even driven architecture.

329
00:22:39,655 --> 00:22:44,985
We, which we briefly discussed about this
architecture turns into leaving evolving

330
00:22:44,985 --> 00:22:50,295
system one that can integrate with future
innovations without major overalls.

331
00:22:50,935 --> 00:22:55,165
And it's the backbone for AI
ready intelligent supply chains.

332
00:22:55,465 --> 00:22:56,995
Let's go to the next slide.

333
00:22:57,495 --> 00:22:57,825
Alright.

334
00:22:57,885 --> 00:23:02,495
As we embrace AI driven ERP platforms,
there's another critical dimension we

335
00:23:02,495 --> 00:23:06,705
cannot overlook which is the security,
the governance, and the compliance.

336
00:23:07,305 --> 00:23:12,225
AI brings immense power, but it
also introduces new risks that,

337
00:23:12,345 --> 00:23:15,765
that demand robust strategies with.

338
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,960
AI embedded into ERP.

339
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:22,730
We are not just processing business
transactions, we are making

340
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:27,730
autonomous decisions, managing
very sensitive data and relying

341
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,740
on the machine learning models.

342
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,850
This raises the stakes for.

343
00:23:33,435 --> 00:23:36,075
Trust, accountability and resilience.

344
00:23:36,795 --> 00:23:40,905
And the key focus area here
is the data governance.

345
00:23:40,985 --> 00:23:45,005
We must ensure data lineage,
quality and transparency.

346
00:23:45,515 --> 00:23:47,705
This includes managing training.

347
00:23:48,155 --> 00:23:54,575
For training data for AI models,
detecting bias and making algorithms

348
00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:56,645
explainable to stakeholders.

349
00:23:57,225 --> 00:24:02,595
Model, the lifecycle management
AI models can't be set and forget.

350
00:24:02,685 --> 00:24:07,945
We need to, we need structured
processes for worsening, for performance

351
00:24:07,945 --> 00:24:09,955
monitoring and automated retraining.

352
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,790
To keep models accurate and reliable.

353
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,430
Then there is, privacy production.

354
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:20,030
Protecting personal and sensitive
data is, is absolutely non-negotiable.

355
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:25,520
Techniques like differential privacy and
federated learning allow us to preserve

356
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,070
privacy while leveraging AI at scale.

357
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,740
Last but not the least is the AI security.

358
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:37,425
We must defend against advers
attacks data poisoning, model

359
00:24:37,425 --> 00:24:39,195
extraction attempt, et cetera.

360
00:24:39,675 --> 00:24:44,985
Without robust security, even the
most advanced AI can be compromised.

361
00:24:45,645 --> 00:24:49,335
And building strong security
governance and compliance framework

362
00:24:49,365 --> 00:24:54,675
ensures that AI enabled ERP systems
are not only innovative, but

363
00:24:54,675 --> 00:24:56,805
also trustworthy and resilient.

364
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,055
This is how we create platform.

365
00:24:59,475 --> 00:25:02,385
That businesses and
regulators can rely on.

366
00:25:02,885 --> 00:25:03,995
Let's move to the next slide.

367
00:25:04,495 --> 00:25:08,305
Alright, so we discussed the technology,
architecture, and the governance.

368
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:09,485
But here's the truth.

369
00:25:10,295 --> 00:25:13,895
Technology alone doesn't
transform business.

370
00:25:14,475 --> 00:25:18,970
People and processes do, so to
fully leverage AI enabled ERP

371
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:23,470
platforms, we must prepare the
organization itself for change.

372
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:29,620
AI enabled ERP is not just a new
system, it's a new way of operating.

373
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:34,180
Success requires rethinking
processes, upskilling of

374
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,340
teams, and evolving leadership.

375
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:41,030
To thrive in this environment
we must strategically redefine

376
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:45,440
workflows, integrating human
expertise with intelligent automation.

377
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,695
And this is not.

378
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,110
About replacing people.

379
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,630
It's about enhancing collaboration
between humans and AI driven systems.

380
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,430
That's about the process
redesign the skills development.

381
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,820
Essentially building the
right technical and business

382
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,270
competencies is very essential.

383
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,355
Team needs to understand data.

384
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,280
AI and process automation to
fully harness this new capability.

385
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:14,630
Then there's the leadership evolution
where leaders play a pivotal role.

386
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:21,150
They must adapt to overseeing hybrid
teams, balancing automated decision

387
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:26,340
making with human judgment and fostering
a culture of innovation and adaptability.

388
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,615
The organizational readiness is.

389
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:31,685
Not a one-time checklist.

390
00:26:31,805 --> 00:26:34,295
It's an ongoing commitment to change.

391
00:26:34,795 --> 00:26:40,105
Companies that embrace this
mindset will lead no while those

392
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,595
who resist risk falling behind.

393
00:26:42,715 --> 00:26:45,430
That's a very simple fact
about organizational read.

394
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,470
With technology, governance and
people all aligned enterprises can

395
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:55,630
truly unlock the power of ERP as the
backbone for AI driven supply chain.

396
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,370
Let's bring this all together
in our final thoughts.

397
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:59,050
Okay.

398
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,010
Going to the next slide.

399
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,550
So we explore the technology, the
architecture, the governance and

400
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,950
the people side of transformation.

401
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,720
Now let's bring it all
together with the big picture.

402
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:15,690
ERP modernization isn't just a IT
project, it's a strategic imperative.

403
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:21,940
The world we operate in is increasingly
complex, very fast moving, unpredictable.

404
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:25,480
Traditionally, ERP
systems ti cannot keep up.

405
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:29,160
They were built for stability
but not for adaptability.

406
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,680
Modern ERP infused with AI becomes
the foundation of intelligent,

407
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,110
responsive, and adaptive enterprise.

408
00:27:38,055 --> 00:27:43,275
Organizations that embrace this
transformation will gain sustainable

409
00:27:43,335 --> 00:27:45,855
advantage that go beyond cost saving.

410
00:27:46,775 --> 00:27:52,445
They'll be able to anticipate customer
needs rather than just re react to them.

411
00:27:53,135 --> 00:27:55,865
Optimize resources across the value.

412
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:00,380
Respond proactively to market
shifts and disruptions.

413
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:04,660
The urgency of action is very important.

414
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:08,200
The window to establish leadership
in this transformation is narrow.

415
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:14,170
Those who act decisively now
will create advantage that

416
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,820
competitors will struggle to match.

417
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:22,210
Those who do delay risk being left
behind in a marketplace that rewards

418
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,520
agility, intelligence, and innovation.

419
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,410
The future belongs to the
enterprise that make ERP the

420
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,330
backbone of AI driven operation.

421
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:37,795
The question isn't if this transformation
is coming, it's whether you will lead.

422
00:28:38,045 --> 00:28:42,095
The transformation or be forced
to catch up, now is the time to

423
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,315
modernize, innovate, and take the lead.

424
00:28:44,815 --> 00:28:45,505
So with that.

425
00:28:46,005 --> 00:28:48,185
Thank you for your time
and engagement today.

426
00:28:48,235 --> 00:28:52,945
I appreciate the opportunity to share
insights on how modern ERP can serve as a

427
00:28:52,945 --> 00:28:55,225
backbone for AI three one supply chains.

428
00:28:55,815 --> 00:28:59,165
We have covered a lot of ground
from the challenges of legacy ERP to

429
00:28:59,165 --> 00:29:04,075
platform engineering, to integration
excellence, AI powered applications,

430
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:07,255
governance and organizational
readiness required to succeed.

431
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,210
The key takeaway is clear.

432
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,480
ERP modernization isn't optional.

433
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:15,490
It's the, it's a foundation of
competitive advantage in the ai.

434
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:19,620
I'd be happy to continue this
conversation, explore your specific

435
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,870
challenges or discuss practical steps to
accelerate your EIP MODERNATION journey.

436
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:28,400
As you go back to your organizations,
I encourage you to ask are we ready

437
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,270
to make the platform that drive
intelligence across our enterprise?

438
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:36,420
Those act now will define the
future for their industries.

439
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,790
Thank you once again.

440
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,740
It's been pleasure speaking with you and
I look forward to the exciting future.

441
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,170
We can build together.

442
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,070
Thank you.
