1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,049
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,329 --> 00:00:03,820
it's a pleasure to be here at con 42.

3
00:00:04,179 --> 00:00:10,139
2025 discussing one of the most,
transformative aspect of modern computing

4
00:00:10,329 --> 00:00:12,469
cloud database management systems.

5
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:14,579
So I'm Prashant Reddy.

6
00:00:14,819 --> 00:00:18,659
And today I'll take you through
the evolution of cloud database,

7
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:22,789
highlighting their advantages,
challenges, and future trends.

8
00:00:23,304 --> 00:00:27,994
So whether you're a database engineer
or architect or a business leader,

9
00:00:28,205 --> 00:00:33,184
this session will provide valuable
insights into navigating the cloud

10
00:00:33,184 --> 00:00:35,385
database landscape effectively.

11
00:00:35,885 --> 00:00:39,835
So let's jump on the rise
of the cloud databases.

12
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,710
So traditional on premise databases
are rapidly being replaced

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,930
by, cloud based solutions.

14
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:52,100
So in fact, like the 90 percent
of the enterprises are expected

15
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,390
to migrate to cloud DBMS by 2025.

16
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,180
So there should be a question why the
answer is simple, the scalability,

17
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,190
flexibility and the cost reduction.

18
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:06,519
So the cloud, database market is booming.

19
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:10,150
and it's projected to
reach, almost like 68.

20
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,670
9 billion dollars by 2026.

21
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,000
Growing at a growth rate of 15.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,455
7%. So the growth is a testament to how
organizations are trusting cloud platforms

23
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:28,724
to manage, their most, critical, assets.

24
00:01:29,124 --> 00:01:34,319
So with this shift, It's essential to
understand how cloud databases work

25
00:01:34,339 --> 00:01:36,569
and what makes them a game changer.

26
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:41,199
So let's jump on to the cloud
advantages, the scalability

27
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:43,549
and cost effect efficiency.

28
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,699
So the cloud databases
revolutionize the way we handle

29
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:50,749
the scalability and the cost.

30
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:57,014
So coming to the elasticity, I would say
the unlike traditional databases, Cloud

31
00:01:57,014 --> 00:02:03,314
DBMS scales instantly from gigabytes
to petabytes within without downtime.

32
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:08,984
So this means the businesses do not
have to over provision the resources.

33
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:13,924
So saving money while saving the
money while ensuring high performance.

34
00:02:14,494 --> 00:02:17,544
coming to the second one, I
would say the multi tenancy.

35
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:23,619
Cloud DBMS reduces the infrastructure
cost by almost 40, 60, 40 to 60 percent

36
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:25,979
compared to the on premise solutions.

37
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:29,509
and the organizations only
pay for what they use.

38
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:34,209
So benefiting from the enterprise
grade security and automatic updates.

39
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:39,679
So the serverless architectures
are to eliminate the infrastructure

40
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:43,219
management, which will be
reducing the DevOps overhead.

41
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:45,159
By up to 80%.

42
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:49,399
the platform which will take care
of the backup scaling and the

43
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:53,599
maintenance allowing teams to
focus on more over the innovation.

44
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:58,589
So these benefits, make cloud
databases cost efficiency.

45
00:02:59,149 --> 00:03:01,869
I would say the scalable
and easy to manage.

46
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:09,464
So coming to the performance and the cost
savings, the real world impact, the impact

47
00:03:09,464 --> 00:03:14,544
of the cloud databases on the performance
and cost savings is undeniable.

48
00:03:14,604 --> 00:03:20,094
I would say like 300 percent
performance boost cloud based system

49
00:03:20,094 --> 00:03:24,364
deliver faster query responses,
allowing real time analytics and

50
00:03:24,514 --> 00:03:27,504
quick business discussions, decisions.

51
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:33,134
So 40 percent infrastructure
cost reduction, smart resource

52
00:03:33,204 --> 00:03:39,094
allocation ensures there are no idle
capacity, keeping cost optimized.

53
00:03:39,774 --> 00:03:44,344
So the 60%, 62 percent total
cost savings over three years.

54
00:03:44,844 --> 00:03:49,679
So when factoring in the hardware,
The maintenance and operation

55
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:54,069
cost organizations see the
significant, financial benefit

56
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:56,259
with these compelling numbers.

57
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:02,739
So it's clear why companies are shifting
to cloud based, database solutions.

58
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:08,159
another challenging is the thing is
the migration and the vendor lock in.

59
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:11,479
of course, the cloud migration
is not without problems.

60
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:16,659
So two major concern I would include
them as migration complexity.

61
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:20,869
So 60 percent of the organization
faces challenges like data

62
00:04:20,869 --> 00:04:25,449
integrity issues, downtime risk
and the schema compatibility.

63
00:04:25,619 --> 00:04:31,999
successful migration basically requires
A careful planning, robust, a testing

64
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:35,349
and the strong execution strategies.

65
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:41,109
So vendor lock in, then the major
another concern is the vendor lock in.

66
00:04:41,109 --> 00:04:45,849
62 percent of the enterprises worry about
being logged into a single cloud provider.

67
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:49,799
The only solution for that is implement
the portable architectures and

68
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:56,819
maintain the clear exit strategies to
prevent the dependency on one vendor.

69
00:04:56,849 --> 00:05:02,074
So addressing these all challenges
ensures a smooth Cloud transition

70
00:05:02,074 --> 00:05:04,034
and long term flexibility.

71
00:05:04,664 --> 00:05:09,214
So coming to another thing is about
a security and high availability.

72
00:05:09,674 --> 00:05:10,594
and building the trust.

73
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,744
So security and availability are
the two priorities of the cloud.

74
00:05:14,254 --> 00:05:19,074
So security investments, cloud
providers invest heavily in the

75
00:05:19,114 --> 00:05:22,947
advanced threat, detection, encryption,
and the compliance measures.

76
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:27,777
So to ensure the data protection
and coming to high availability.

77
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:32,647
Cloud database management
system solutions guarantee 99.

78
00:05:32,717 --> 00:05:38,307
9 percent uptime down for sure and
higher, reducing the downtime and

79
00:05:38,307 --> 00:05:42,647
ensuring the business continuity
by leveraging these capabilities.

80
00:05:43,057 --> 00:05:49,687
Organizations can confidently move
to the cloud while keeping their

81
00:05:50,057 --> 00:05:53,417
data secure and high available.

82
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,907
So as we look.

83
00:05:55,352 --> 00:05:59,252
So basically, as we look to the
future trends, NoSQL and the hybrid

84
00:05:59,252 --> 00:06:04,302
solutions, there are three key
trends are shaping the industry.

85
00:06:04,302 --> 00:06:09,832
So the NoSQL in databases growing
in popularity for handling the

86
00:06:09,832 --> 00:06:14,042
unstructured data and supporting
high volume transactions.

87
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:18,832
And the hybrid cloud solutions,
is the best of the relational

88
00:06:18,832 --> 00:06:24,012
and NoSQL databases to handle
diverse data workloads efficiently.

89
00:06:24,432 --> 00:06:28,872
And the cloud native applications,
more applications are being built

90
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:33,722
specifically for the cloud, utilizing
the serverless and the microservices.

91
00:06:34,442 --> 00:06:38,722
architectures for improving resiliency.

92
00:06:39,062 --> 00:06:43,362
So these trends continue to
define how business, store

93
00:06:43,482 --> 00:06:45,712
manage and leverage their data.

94
00:06:46,262 --> 00:06:49,802
So the demand for the
cloud database expertise.

95
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:52,347
has also reshaped the job market.

96
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:58,597
So the salary premium, the cloud database
expert, and 17 percent higher salaries

97
00:06:58,607 --> 00:07:03,817
than the traditional, database, management
system professionals, and coming to

98
00:07:03,817 --> 00:07:08,967
the industry demand organizations are
actively seeking skilled professionals

99
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:14,287
to manage their cloud database
environments and the career opportunity,

100
00:07:14,487 --> 00:07:18,237
I would say the cloud database skills
are now essential for the career

101
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:20,737
advancement in the data driven world.

102
00:07:21,077 --> 00:07:24,957
So investing in the cloud
expertise is no longer an optional.

103
00:07:25,017 --> 00:07:27,947
It's a necessary for I. T. Professionals.

104
00:07:28,117 --> 00:07:31,547
So from these, we can
the key tech takeaways.

105
00:07:32,047 --> 00:07:38,567
The embrace embracing the cloud revolution
is to summarize the organization should

106
00:07:38,587 --> 00:07:42,877
focus on three main key aspects to
leverage the cloud database effectively.

107
00:07:42,877 --> 00:07:47,877
I would say the cost efficiency, security
and reliability and future proofing.

108
00:07:47,887 --> 00:07:49,947
So coming to cost efficiency.

109
00:07:50,607 --> 00:07:55,937
So the business can reduce total
ownership, cost by 62%, as I said

110
00:07:55,957 --> 00:08:00,297
earlier, through the dynamic scaling
and the resource optimization.

111
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:05,057
So the coming to security and
reliability, cloud databases provide.

112
00:08:05,642 --> 00:08:10,992
Enterprise grade security and high
availability, making them ideal

113
00:08:11,002 --> 00:08:16,312
for mission critical applications
and coming to the future proofing

114
00:08:16,692 --> 00:08:21,812
investing in hybrid cloud strategies
and cloud database expertise is

115
00:08:21,812 --> 00:08:27,282
a crucial for staying competitive
in a rapidly evolving landscape.

116
00:08:27,282 --> 00:08:32,802
So by embracing the cloud revolution,
Organizations can achieve a greater

117
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:35,952
efficiency, security and the innovation.

118
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:40,732
So coming to, so basically coming to
the navigating the cloud databases

119
00:08:40,732 --> 00:08:43,972
landscape for the organizations
planning to migrate to the cloud,

120
00:08:44,362 --> 00:08:45,892
we need to follow a couple of steps.

121
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:48,572
So basically, assess what we need.

122
00:08:49,277 --> 00:08:52,207
analyze your database workloads,
compliance requirements

123
00:08:52,207 --> 00:08:54,017
and peak usage patterns.

124
00:08:54,377 --> 00:08:57,837
And, the next major important
step is explore the options.

125
00:08:58,217 --> 00:09:04,257
So compare, cloud providers
with AWS, Azure, Cloud, Google

126
00:09:04,287 --> 00:09:10,227
Cloud, and evaluating their cost,
scalability and, security features.

127
00:09:10,647 --> 00:09:14,867
So the next major important
step is like pilot and migrate.

128
00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:17,622
So that's, begin with a small scale pilot.

129
00:09:17,782 --> 00:09:21,882
I would say 10 to 15 percent of
the data before executing the full

130
00:09:21,892 --> 00:09:25,572
migration, implement the paddle
operations to minimize the downtime.

131
00:09:25,592 --> 00:09:27,812
So that's a major, a step.

132
00:09:28,312 --> 00:09:29,842
Every organization should be following.

133
00:09:30,232 --> 00:09:35,942
So a well planned approach ensures
a smooth transition and maximum

134
00:09:35,952 --> 00:09:37,542
value from the cloud adoption.

135
00:09:38,212 --> 00:09:42,632
so from all these, the next steps, I
would say, stay ahead of the curve.

136
00:09:42,742 --> 00:09:46,527
So to maintain the competitive,
Edge in the cloud database

137
00:09:46,527 --> 00:09:50,687
management, we need to encourage
continuous learning within our team.

138
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:55,057
So regularly evaluate emerging
technologies to stay ahead of the

139
00:09:55,057 --> 00:09:59,777
industry trends and, the partner build
the partnerships with the cloud providers

140
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:02,677
to leverage any new capabilities.

141
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:07,427
So cloud technology is evolving
fast and, and staying ahead

142
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:09,597
will be the key to the success.

143
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:13,112
So I would say, yeah.

144
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,732
So thank you all for
your time and attention.

145
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:20,262
I hope this session has provided you with
a valuable insights into the evolution

146
00:10:20,262 --> 00:10:25,952
of cloud databases and how to navigate
the challenges and opportunities ahead.

147
00:10:26,552 --> 00:10:28,772
so yeah, I would like
to hear your thoughts.

148
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:33,072
Let's open the floor for any
questions or any discussions.

149
00:10:33,652 --> 00:10:34,492
Thank you so much.
