00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,279
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,759 --> 00:00:03,349
I'm Karthik Mohan Moran.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,629
I'm a software engineer with about
eight years of experience in full stack

4
00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:11,759
development specializing in Salesforce.

5
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,259
I've also worked with big
queries in Google Cloud platform

6
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,389
and Python for data analytics.

7
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:24,419
My expertise lies in designing and
developing user interface solutions.

8
00:00:24,749 --> 00:00:31,560
And enterprise integrations are to
deliver exceptional user experiences.

9
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,890
I've seen firsthand how the UI can make or
break a user's experience and efficiency,

10
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,060
especially in complex enterprise systems.

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,815
That's why I'm so passionate about
the topic we are diving into today.

12
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,260
Emotional intelligence in the cloud.

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,570
In this presentation, we'll be exploring
how we can create adaptive interfaces

14
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:04,250
that don't just process data, but also
actually understand and respond to the

15
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,120
users cognitive and emotional state.

16
00:01:07,975 --> 00:01:13,165
We'll start by looking at the current
implementation gap in this technology

17
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:19,645
and then highlight the proven benefits
that emotionally aware interfaces offer.

18
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:24,975
We'll dive into the methodologies
and accuracy of how these systems

19
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:33,645
infer user states non-invasively and
discover and discuss the various,

20
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:35,995
adaptive mechanisms they can employ.

21
00:01:36,495 --> 00:01:41,215
We'll also review the significant
performance improvements observed.

22
00:01:41,715 --> 00:01:48,465
We'll also discuss some time on
the ethical considerations and

23
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:54,915
user acceptance factors, which are
essentially finally we'll touch upon

24
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,510
the implementation architecture.

25
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,970
A roadmap for adoption and future
directions in this exciting field.

26
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:07,810
My goal is to show how this is a
leap forward in making our enterprise

27
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:13,900
software more intuitive, supportive,
and ultimately more human centric.

28
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,859
Particularly when the stakes
are high let's dive into it.

29
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:25,659
The core idea is to transform our
enterprise software by embedding

30
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:28,119
effective computing principles.

31
00:02:28,619 --> 00:02:35,429
This means we need to create systems
that can detect and intelligently

32
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:39,449
respond to our cognitive and
emotional states in real time.

33
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:46,049
While the benefits like better decision,
quality and user satisfaction are well

34
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:53,669
documented, the actual implementation of
these emotionally aware systems in the

35
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:57,119
enterprise environments has been limited.

36
00:02:57,619 --> 00:03:03,019
We will explore the architecture
and methodologies behind building

37
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:05,259
these, responsive interfaces.

38
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:12,399
Interfaces that adapt dynamically by
analyzing non-invasive interaction

39
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:18,539
data, which is particularly
crucial for enhancing performance

40
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,639
in high stakes scenarios.

41
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:21,469
Okay.

42
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,569
So let's look at the
current implementation gap.

43
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:30,659
As we can see from the chart and
as research confirms, there is a

44
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:36,329
striking disparity despite clear
evidence of their effectiveness.

45
00:03:36,779 --> 00:03:41,699
Enterprise systems are significantly
behind consumer applications

46
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,349
when it comes to adopting these
effective computing principles.

47
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:51,389
To put some numbers on it only about
18% of the current enterprise systems

48
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:53,729
utilize any effective principles.

49
00:03:54,539 --> 00:04:00,809
Some studies even place the figure for
comprehensive emotional awareness lower

50
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:08,729
around 13.6% compared that to the consumer
space where nearly 69% of applications

51
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:10,979
already feature adaptive elements.

52
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:17,649
What's particularly concerning is
that this gap is even wider in high

53
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:22,629
stakes environments where you'd expect
the benefits to be the most sought.

54
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:32,789
After we see adoption rates as low as
7.2% in the financial platforms, 5.8%

55
00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:34,739
in the healthcare management systems.

56
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:40,184
A mere 3.4% in the critical
infrastructure operations.

57
00:04:40,684 --> 00:04:44,284
Now given that the technological
foundation has matured

58
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:50,564
considerably, we can suggest that
the primary hurdles are now more

59
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:54,424
organizational than purely technical.

60
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:56,704
Okay, let's move on.

61
00:04:57,204 --> 00:04:58,554
Let's see some benefits.

62
00:04:58,664 --> 00:05:03,504
Although we are seeing a lot of gap in
the implementation of these adaptive

63
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:09,424
systems or these computing principles
the proven benefits of these interfaces

64
00:05:09,484 --> 00:05:12,634
are undeniable and quite compelling.

65
00:05:13,134 --> 00:05:17,724
For example, in a high stakes field,
like healthcare studies have found

66
00:05:17,724 --> 00:05:23,454
that professionals using emotionally
responsive interfaces experienced a

67
00:05:23,544 --> 00:05:31,354
27% reduction in diagnostic errors
and a 34% improvement in their dec

68
00:05:31,744 --> 00:05:36,624
decision confidence course, particularly
during the critical care situations.

69
00:05:37,124 --> 00:05:40,484
That's like a direct impact
on patient outcomes and clinic

70
00:05:40,784 --> 00:05:45,694
clinician assurance across various
complex enterprise environments.

71
00:05:45,754 --> 00:05:54,414
Integrating effective computing has been
shown to reduce cognitive load by 37.2%.

72
00:05:54,914 --> 00:05:59,774
Imagine how much that can alleviate
mental fatigue and improve focus.

73
00:05:59,894 --> 00:06:06,184
Consequently, we also see a 29% increase
in task accuracy across multiple sectors.

74
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:09,504
And these are not just isolated findings.

75
00:06:10,224 --> 00:06:15,244
There are comprehensive studies for
example, there is one involving about

76
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:22,074
1800 participants that has established
statistically significant correlations.

77
00:06:22,574 --> 00:06:28,114
Between like the interface, adaptability,
and enhance the performance metrics.

78
00:06:29,104 --> 00:06:33,684
These improvements clearly demonstrate
the transformative potential we

79
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:38,534
are talking about, especially in
demanding enterprise settings.

80
00:06:39,034 --> 00:06:40,054
Let's go to the next slide.

81
00:06:40,554 --> 00:06:45,264
So how do these systems actually infer
our emotional or cognitive state?

82
00:06:45,764 --> 00:06:50,094
It's done through very intelligent
and pretty clever, effective

83
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:55,824
inference methodologies, focusing
mainly on non-invasive data.

84
00:06:56,324 --> 00:07:00,330
For example let's go first with
the interaction velocity analysis.

85
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:06,340
This looks at things like typing rhythm
variations here can co correlate quite

86
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,920
strongly with cogniti cognitive load.

87
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,280
Like there are some values here
which is statistically significant.

88
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:19,510
For example, if your keyboard
interaction speed drops by 21.7%.

89
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,910
It's a consistent indicator of
increased cognitive demands.

90
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:25,650
Okay.

91
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:29,689
Other method is error pattern recognition.

92
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:33,974
The way we make mistakes
can be, very telling.

93
00:07:34,474 --> 00:07:39,024
Clustering patterns of errors,
for example, can predict fatigue

94
00:07:39,114 --> 00:07:44,004
with around 72.8% accuracy.

95
00:07:44,504 --> 00:07:51,744
If someone's correction behavior
suddenly jumps by 28.5%, it often signals

96
00:07:51,794 --> 00:07:56,504
frustration, even the types of errors
like increase in navigation errors.

97
00:07:57,015 --> 00:08:02,445
Versus data entry errors can create
recognizable emotional signatures.

98
00:08:02,945 --> 00:08:06,534
Then there's this workflow
sequencing behavior.

99
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,864
Then we are cognitively overloaded.

100
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:17,639
We tend to deviate more from optimal
task paths by as much as 52.7%.

101
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:22,129
Machine learning models can
analyze the sequence patterns alone

102
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:29,780
and detect decision hesitation
with about 74.6% accuracy.

103
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,090
Let's go next slide.

104
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:36,520
Okay let's dig a bit deeper into
these non-invasive detection methods

105
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:41,500
because they rely on the subtle
cues from our everyday interactions.

106
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,460
We've touched on the typing rhythm
variations like these correlate with

107
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,660
cognitive load at an R value of 0.73.

108
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:57,230
And like a 21.7% drop
in the keyboard speed.

109
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,950
That is a strong signal of
increased mental demand.

110
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,710
Also we have the mouse movement patterns.

111
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,180
They are pretty insightful.

112
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:09,620
How do you move?

113
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,825
Your mouse can show correlations.

114
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:16,885
With states of emotional discomfort
or uncertainty, essentially

115
00:09:16,885 --> 00:09:23,015
creating recognizable digital
signatures of the user's experience.

116
00:09:23,515 --> 00:09:26,305
Then we have a temporal
engagement metrics.

117
00:09:26,905 --> 00:09:29,465
This includes things like dwell time.

118
00:09:29,965 --> 00:09:33,735
So if a user's dwell time
on a particularly complex

119
00:09:33,735 --> 00:09:36,405
interface element increases by.

120
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:42,720
38.4%, it correlates strongly
with the state of confusion.

121
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:48,360
Similarly, if their attention switching
frequency that is like how often

122
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:55,380
they jump between elements increases
by around 57.3%, it's a reliable

123
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,210
indicator of information overload.

124
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:02,570
All these indicators are then processed
by increasingly sophisticated models.

125
00:10:03,215 --> 00:10:08,765
And using supervised learning,
particularly ensemble based

126
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:17,495
architectures, we are now achieving
around 79.5% classification accuracy

127
00:10:17,555 --> 00:10:21,035
across five distinct emotional states.

128
00:10:21,535 --> 00:10:30,595
Okay, so what is the accuracy of the
effective inference methods right now?

129
00:10:30,655 --> 00:10:32,725
Let's consolidate the accuracy.

130
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:37,105
As you can see in this table,
the numbers are quite promising.

131
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:41,085
For like the overall emotional
state detection, we are looking

132
00:10:41,085 --> 00:10:43,905
at around 77.4% accuracy.

133
00:10:44,715 --> 00:10:48,645
The typing rhythm correlation
with cognitive load is a

134
00:10:48,645 --> 00:10:52,835
strong 0.73 mouse movement.

135
00:10:52,905 --> 00:10:58,135
Patterns show a correlation of
0.68 with emotional states, we

136
00:10:58,135 --> 00:11:04,350
can predict fatigue from error
patterns with about 72.8% accuracy.

137
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:12,760
Decision hesitation detection from
workflow sequencing is at 74.6%,

138
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:19,400
and the correlation between dwell
time and confusion is a high 0.77.

139
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:25,310
Importantly, when classifying across
these five distinct emotional states,

140
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,040
our accuracy is now reaching 79.5%.

141
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,350
What's really pushing these advancements
is the underlying technology.

142
00:11:35,015 --> 00:11:39,565
Cloud-based processing infrastructures
have slashed inference latency.

143
00:11:39,715 --> 00:11:43,345
That is the time it takes to
make a detection by nearly

144
00:11:43,345 --> 00:11:46,930
62% just since the year 2020.

145
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,950
Furthermore, federated learning
approaches are enabling privacy,

146
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:57,645
preserving insights across organizations
while maintaining a remarkable.

147
00:11:58,145 --> 00:12:03,735
88.3% accuracy, which you'd
get from a centralized model.

148
00:12:04,235 --> 00:12:08,645
This is key for scaling these
systems effectively and ethically.

149
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:09,435
Okay.

150
00:12:09,935 --> 00:12:13,585
Okay, so the systems infer a user state.

151
00:12:14,365 --> 00:12:15,505
What happens after that?

152
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:20,485
This is where the adaptive interface
mechanisms kick in, allowing the

153
00:12:20,485 --> 00:12:22,375
interface to respond intelligently.

154
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:27,015
First information density
modulation the system.

155
00:12:27,075 --> 00:12:32,305
What it does is the system can
dynamically adjust the complexity of the

156
00:12:32,305 --> 00:12:35,845
interface based on the cognitive state.

157
00:12:36,775 --> 00:12:40,755
Let's say for example, reducing
interface complexity during

158
00:12:40,755 --> 00:12:43,425
detective cognitive overload.

159
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:52,845
This has resulted in a 32.6% decrease
in decision errors under 35.8%

160
00:12:52,935 --> 00:12:56,045
improvement in task completion times.

161
00:12:56,545 --> 00:12:58,225
Contextual assistant deployment.

162
00:12:58,965 --> 00:13:04,115
Let's say if confusion is detected,
the system can proactively offer help.

163
00:13:05,045 --> 00:13:09,815
This has been shown to reduce the
support ticket submissions by a

164
00:13:09,815 --> 00:13:17,830
significant 38.2% and decrease the
task abandonment rates by 26.4%.

165
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,680
Workflow simplification.

166
00:13:19,935 --> 00:13:20,225
Okay.

167
00:13:20,725 --> 00:13:25,505
During like high stress periods
the interface can restructure

168
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:27,685
complex complex tasks.

169
00:13:28,105 --> 00:13:36,895
This has led to a 31.5% reduction
in error rates and a nearly 25%

170
00:13:37,075 --> 00:13:41,535
decrease in reported stress levels
interface, contrast enhancement.

171
00:13:42,525 --> 00:13:46,485
The system can make
dynamic visual adjustments.

172
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:55,145
Based on attention, state visual tracking
studies confirmed a 37.6% improvement in

173
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:58,385
attention allocation to critical elements.

174
00:13:58,385 --> 00:14:03,375
With such dynamic adjustments
and crucially intelligent timing

175
00:14:03,435 --> 00:14:09,125
of interventions, this optimizes
notification delivery to reduce

176
00:14:09,635 --> 00:14:13,505
interruptions leading to a 47 41 0.7.

177
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:19,310
Percent reduction in workflow
interruptions and a 27.3%

178
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,260
decrease in task recovery time.

179
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,550
These mechanisms work together to
create truly responsive environments.

180
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:34,210
Modern implementations are achieving
around 71.8% accuracy in state

181
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:41,620
detection with an impressive
89.2% user satisfaction rate.

182
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:46,380
Regarding the appropriateness
of these adaptations.

183
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,360
Okay, so performance improvements.

184
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,480
Now let's consolidate these performance
improvements because they truly highlight

185
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,870
the impact of emotionally aware interfaces
as we have seen from various studies.

186
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:07,830
In healthcare, we are observing a 27%
reduction in diagnostic error and a 34%

187
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,870
improvement in decision confidence scores.

188
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:18,070
When it comes to task efficiency,
users are completing tasks 35.8%

189
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:25,210
faster, and there's a 29.4%
increase in overall task accuracy.

190
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,595
So it's not just faster, but it's also.

191
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,000
More accurate.

192
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:36,800
The cognitive benefits are
substantial with a 37.2% reduction

193
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:44,450
in measured cognitive load and a
32.6% decrease in decision errors.

194
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,580
And these systems even reduce
the burden of support needs

195
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,250
on support needs leading to.

196
00:15:51,750 --> 00:16:00,540
38.2% reduction in support ticket
submissions and a 26.4% decrease

197
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,850
in task abandonment rates.

198
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:08,900
These figures collectively demonstrate the
significant positive impact across a range

199
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:14,020
of critical metrics, especially in those
high stakes enterprise environments where

200
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:17,270
decision quality is absolutely paramount.

201
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:22,830
Now what is the implementation
architecture that powers

202
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,180
these adaptive systems?

203
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,660
So it can generally be broken
down into four key layers.

204
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,260
The first one is data collection.

205
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,490
This involves gathering those non-invasive
interaction patterns we've discussed

206
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:41,700
typing behavior, mouse movements,
workflow navigation, and so on.

207
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,945
And then we have the next
layer as the inference engine.

208
00:16:48,445 --> 00:16:53,385
Here we have our machine learning
models that process this interaction

209
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:57,355
data to detect the user's
emotional and cognitive states.

210
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:02,365
And then we have the next layer,
which is the adapt adaptation rules.

211
00:17:02,865 --> 00:17:06,835
This is the decision logic
based on the inferred state.

212
00:17:07,165 --> 00:17:11,845
These rules determine the most
appropriate interface modifications.

213
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:15,105
And then there's the interface adaptation.

214
00:17:15,605 --> 00:17:20,395
So this is the dynamic adjustment
The user actually experiences.

215
00:17:20,995 --> 00:17:25,295
Like changes to the information density,
contextual help popping up simplified

216
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:28,665
workflows or visual enhancements.

217
00:17:29,165 --> 00:17:31,265
The key factor here is speed.

218
00:17:32,115 --> 00:17:37,365
Modern implementations like a four
layer framework documented by Morales

219
00:17:37,785 --> 00:17:43,690
can achieve an insurance to adaptation
latency of just 2 85 milliseconds.

220
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,320
This allows for truly
real time responsiveness.

221
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:52,910
And it's a cloud-based processing
that provides the backbone, enabling

222
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:57,750
these sophisticated models while
maintaining performance across

223
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,850
diverse enterprise environments.

224
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,010
Now, we absolutely must address the.

225
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,010
Ethical considerations.

226
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:11,220
This technology is powerful, and
with that power comes responsibility.

227
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,500
Fir first, transparent consent.

228
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,100
It's not enough for systems to be smart.

229
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,405
Users must understand that.

230
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:22,170
Agree to how the data is being used.

231
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,930
Properly implemented.

232
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:27,860
Transparency measures can
increase user acceptance by a

233
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:32,240
67.3% compared to opaque systems.

234
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:39,030
When it comes to sharing interaction
data, a striking 78.4% of users are

235
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:47,115
willing if they are given granular
opt-in permissions versus only 29.2%

236
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,995
Who accept blanket consent models?

237
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,465
This really highlights
the need for user control.

238
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:57,145
Next inference, accuracy, and fallbacks.

239
00:18:57,895 --> 00:18:59,755
So no system is perfect.

240
00:19:00,245 --> 00:19:02,315
Graceful degradation protocols.

241
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:07,265
What happens when the system has
low confidence in its inference?

242
00:19:07,765 --> 00:19:10,730
That's what graceful
degradation protocols are.

243
00:19:11,425 --> 00:19:16,315
This can reduce negative user
experience by nearly 64%.

244
00:19:16,815 --> 00:19:20,865
Implementing confidence thresholds
where the system defaults to a static

245
00:19:20,865 --> 00:19:26,845
interface, if I'm unsure, improves
overall user satisfaction by almost 39%.

246
00:19:27,345 --> 00:19:32,580
And a major ongoing challenge is
the algorithmic bias mitigation.

247
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:39,860
So unmitigated systems can show
inference accuracy by as much as

248
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:48,620
24.8% across different cultural
backgrounds and 29.3% across age groups.

249
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,280
This is clearly unacceptable.

250
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:56,920
The good news is that by using a
balanced training data set and.

251
00:19:57,475 --> 00:20:03,535
Cultural calibration, these disparities
can be significantly reduced down to

252
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:07,615
around 8.3% and 10.6% respectively.

253
00:20:08,115 --> 00:20:12,075
Okay let's continue with the
user concerns and safeguards.

254
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:16,885
The primary concern is
employee monitoring boundaries.

255
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:22,640
It's understandable that users
worry about how effective data.

256
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,190
Might be used.

257
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:30,300
In fact, 71.5% of the surveyed enterprise
users are concerned about its potential

258
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,270
misuse for performance and evaluations.

259
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,300
That's right concern.

260
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,530
However, implementing technical
safeguards that explicitly prevent the

261
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:46,140
extraction of individual performance
metrics from this data can boost the

262
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,900
system trust ratings by nearly 60%.

263
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,610
It's about support, not surveillance.

264
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,070
We don't want to micromanage people.

265
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:58,410
User override capabilities
are also absolutely essential.

266
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,645
Users need to feel in control.

267
00:21:01,145 --> 00:21:09,905
Systems that provide easy to use override
mechanisms achieve a remarkable 82.3%

268
00:21:09,905 --> 00:21:15,665
higher user satisfaction score than
those without such controls maintaining

269
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:17,905
user agency over their experience.

270
00:21:18,405 --> 00:21:22,545
This all points to the importance
of an ethics by design approach.

271
00:21:23,025 --> 00:21:26,565
Building ethical guardrails into
the system from the very beginning

272
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:31,245
and being transparent about them
doesn't just address privacy concerns.

273
00:21:31,515 --> 00:21:33,945
It substantially
increases system adoption.

274
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:40,345
Longitudinal studies have even
documented a 53.2%, higher

275
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,935
implementation success rate.

276
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:49,240
For systems that incorporate ethics by
design principles from the outset rather

277
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,100
than treating ethics as an afterthought
or a mere compliance checkbox.

278
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:00,000
So what are the key user acceptance
factors that drive adoption of

279
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,540
these emotionally aware interfaces?

280
00:22:03,485 --> 00:22:09,545
The data is quite clear as illustrated
here and backed by numerous studies.

281
00:22:10,045 --> 00:22:14,605
First and foremost, acceptance is heavily
influenced by the implementation of

282
00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:18,925
these ethical safeguards and transparency
measures we've just discussed.

283
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:24,225
Users need to trust the system
and understand how it operates.

284
00:22:24,915 --> 00:22:25,635
Secondly.

285
00:22:26,385 --> 00:22:31,155
Providing granular control and
clear accessible overhead mechanisms

286
00:22:31,245 --> 00:22:35,625
significantly boost their willingness
to adopt and use these systems.

287
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:40,675
It's about empowering the user, and
thirdly, specifically addressing

288
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:44,725
those concerns about the misuse
of data for performance evaluation

289
00:22:45,415 --> 00:22:49,380
through robust technical safeguards
is absolutely essential for

290
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,100
building and maintaining trust.

291
00:22:52,075 --> 00:22:55,165
Especially within enterprise environments.

292
00:22:55,665 --> 00:23:00,375
Ultimately, users are more likely to
embrace these technologies if they

293
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:05,685
feel respected in control and confident
that the system is there to support

294
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:07,935
them, not to judge or undermine them.

295
00:23:08,435 --> 00:23:12,340
Okay, so implementation roadmap.

296
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,280
Bringing these sophisticated
systems to life requires a

297
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,410
structured implementation roadmap.

298
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:21,400
It begins with the
assessment and planning.

299
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:26,580
This involves thoroughly evaluating
current interfaces, identifying those

300
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,730
high stakes workflows where adaptation
can yield the most benefits, and crucially

301
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:38,280
establishing solid ethical frameworks
and clear consent models from day one.

302
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:43,880
We also need to determine the most
appropriate adaptation mechanisms for

303
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,190
specific use cases during this phase.

304
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,850
Next is pilot implementation.

305
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:55,770
The strategy here is to deploy in
limited control environments, ensuring

306
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,990
robust feedback mechanisms are in place.

307
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,710
Transparent communication
about the system's capabilities

308
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,170
and its limitations is vital.

309
00:24:05,025 --> 00:24:10,035
As it's as is the comprehensive
user training, especially on how

310
00:24:10,035 --> 00:24:12,315
to use any override controls.

311
00:24:12,815 --> 00:24:16,105
Following the pilot, we moved
to refinement and expansion.

312
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:21,805
This is where we meticulously analyze
pilot data to improve inference

313
00:24:21,805 --> 00:24:27,585
accuracy and ensure the adaptations
are genuinely appropriate and helpful.

314
00:24:28,085 --> 00:24:34,565
Any identified bias issues or other user
concerns must be rigorously addressed

315
00:24:34,565 --> 00:24:39,785
before gradually expanding the system
to additional workflows and user groups.

316
00:24:40,285 --> 00:24:43,585
Finally continuous I improvement
is an ongoing commitment.

317
00:24:44,485 --> 00:24:48,325
This means establishing persistent
monitoring of system performance

318
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:54,505
and user satisfaction regularly
updating the underlying models.

319
00:24:55,005 --> 00:24:59,715
To enhance accuracy and potentially
expanding emotional state detection

320
00:24:59,715 --> 00:25:04,965
capabilities and always maintaining
open channels for user feedback.

321
00:25:05,465 --> 00:25:10,875
Okay, so as we look to the
future direction and draw our

322
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:14,085
conclusions, the cloud interface.

323
00:25:14,585 --> 00:25:14,945
Sorry.

324
00:25:15,005 --> 00:25:20,305
The cloud infrastructure evolution is
a key enabler, continued improvements

325
00:25:20,305 --> 00:25:24,575
in processing efficiency, and the
maturation of federated learning

326
00:25:24,605 --> 00:25:29,645
approaches will continue to reduce
the technical barriers to implementing

327
00:25:29,645 --> 00:25:31,235
these sophisticated systems.

328
00:25:31,735 --> 00:25:36,940
This also paves the way for cross
organizational insights where privacy,

329
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:41,050
preserving federated learning allows for
shared learning and model improvement.

330
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:46,920
Maintaining around 88.3% of
centralized model accuracy without

331
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,720
compromising sensitive data.

332
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,250
The ongoing ethical framework
development is paramount.

333
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:58,850
We need standardized approaches to
transparency, consent, and bias mitigation

334
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:06,940
to ensure these technologies are properly
implemented responsibly and can scale.

335
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,710
Effectively, let's not forget the profound
potential for enhancing occupational

336
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:17,050
wellbeing beyond pure performance
gains, these systems can significantly

337
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:21,880
contribute to reduced stress and improved
workplace satisfaction for the users.

338
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,790
What we are witnessing is a
significant evolution in enterprise

339
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,070
software design philosophy.

340
00:26:27,935 --> 00:26:28,415
It's a shift.

341
00:26:28,835 --> 00:26:33,065
It's a shift from a singular focus
on functional efficiency to creating

342
00:26:33,065 --> 00:26:36,895
systems that's that dynamically
and intelligently respond to human,

343
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,635
cognitive and emotional needs.

344
00:26:39,135 --> 00:26:44,985
As the technical hurdles continue to
diminish, our most critical work will

345
00:26:44,985 --> 00:26:50,655
lie in thoughtful considerations of these
design principles and the unwavering

346
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,835
commitment to robust ethical frameworks.

347
00:26:54,335 --> 00:26:59,025
This is how we'll create systems
that don't just perform tasks, but

348
00:26:59,025 --> 00:27:05,745
genuinely enhance human capability and
respect fundamental rights and privacy.

349
00:27:06,245 --> 00:27:11,075
Thank you for giving me this opportunity
to speak to you on this paper.

350
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,260
Have a good day.
