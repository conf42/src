00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,280
Hi, welcome to the conference.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,709
Today I will be talking about
self-healing BLE networks

3
00:00:06,949 --> 00:00:09,440
powering resilient iot at scale.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,970
Introduction to self-healing BLE networks.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,159
Today we are exploring a
transformative approach to

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,540
internet of things, specifically
self feeling Bluetooth networks.

7
00:00:23,229 --> 00:00:27,700
In an increasing connected
world, we need networks.

8
00:00:28,225 --> 00:00:33,535
That can automatically detect,
diagnose, and recover from fault

9
00:00:33,595 --> 00:00:35,095
without human intervention.

10
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:41,455
The core concept is simple, yet
powerful, create intelligent network

11
00:00:42,114 --> 00:00:44,125
that can maintain themselves.

12
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:50,335
BLE has emerged as an ideal
protocol for iot due to its low

13
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:55,555
power consumption and scalability,
but traditional approaches have.

14
00:00:55,914 --> 00:00:59,905
Struggle to make these
networks truly resilient.

15
00:01:00,404 --> 00:01:04,660
So let's talk about the growth and
importance of network resilience.

16
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,009
Let's talk.

17
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:11,230
Talk about the market dynamics,
the self-healing iot market is.

18
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:18,295
Predicted to expand dynamically
through 2030, driven primarily

19
00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:21,115
by industrial sector adoption.

20
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:27,265
This isn't just technological
trends, it's a business imperative.

21
00:01:28,015 --> 00:01:35,055
Critical industries like healthcare and
infrastructures are targeting 99% uptime.

22
00:01:35,715 --> 00:01:38,840
That means less than an
hour of downtime per year.

23
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,380
A standard that demands
extraordinary network reliability

24
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:49,890
as an as enter, enterprises
develop IOT systems at mass scale.

25
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,170
We are talking thousands of
interconnected sensors and devices

26
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,589
that meets for advanced self-healing
protocol becoming crucial.

27
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:05,919
Current challenges in IOT networks,
the obstacles are significant.

28
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,089
Significant.

29
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:13,959
BLE devices are in currently
resource constrained with limited

30
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,509
processing capabilities and memory.

31
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:22,749
This restricts the complexity of
algorithms we implement, creating a

32
00:02:22,749 --> 00:02:28,690
fundamental challenge in building in
intelligent network as networks grows.

33
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,839
Reliability become reliability
becomes exponential and more complex.

34
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:39,660
More nodes means more potential
points of failure leading to

35
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,480
unpredictable propagation patterns.

36
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:48,440
Traditional fault recovery methods
suffer from unacceptable latency

37
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,710
between detecting a fault and recovering
the network power consumption.

38
00:02:54,535 --> 00:02:59,785
Add another layer of complexity
in field development.

39
00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:06,685
Continuous network monitoring can rapidly
deplete battery services, making long-term

40
00:03:07,045 --> 00:03:09,715
autonomous operation, challenging

41
00:03:10,215 --> 00:03:12,475
our open source framework approach.

42
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:13,195
We.

43
00:03:13,395 --> 00:03:17,925
We developed a comprehensive
solution addressing these challenges

44
00:03:18,315 --> 00:03:19,755
through four key innovation.

45
00:03:19,905 --> 00:03:22,125
First intelligent recovery.

46
00:03:22,725 --> 00:03:26,985
We have implemented machine learning
based anomaly detection with

47
00:03:27,105 --> 00:03:29,415
predictive healing capabilities.

48
00:03:29,685 --> 00:03:34,040
This means not just detecting failure,
but anticipating and preventing them.

49
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,380
Second, a distributed architecture
that enables coordination.

50
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,610
Between local and network level healing
mechanism devices can make intelligent

51
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:53,120
autonomous decisions while contributing
to overall network resilience.

52
00:03:53,630 --> 00:04:00,050
Third memory efficient design are
algorithms are purpose built for

53
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:05,600
resource constrained iot devices,
ensuring sophisticated fault recovery

54
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,750
mechanisms with minimal memory footprint.

55
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:13,595
Finally, we have leveraged modern
programming patterns that enables

56
00:04:13,655 --> 00:04:19,265
advanced concurrent processing with
minimal computational overhead.

57
00:04:19,765 --> 00:04:24,805
Next, let's talk about power
efficiency across operational states.

58
00:04:25,525 --> 00:04:32,715
Our power optimized strategies cover
every network, operational state due.

59
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,880
During active scanning, we have
reduced power draw by 60 to 75, 70

60
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,730
5% through dynamic channel hopping
and adaptive duty cycle in connected

61
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:49,650
mode, optimized packet framing and
connection intervals tuning E 40%.

62
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,430
Energy saving.

63
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,140
Energy consumption.

64
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:58,320
Our fault detection mechanism uses
intelligent, threshold based monitoring,

65
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,125
reduces power spikes by 83% compared to.

66
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,870
Periodic pooling.

67
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:11,260
In standard mode, we have achieved
sub 10 point, sub 10 micro amp powers

68
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,500
consumption with a vehicle latency under
3.5 milliseconds for critical events.

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,290
Let's talk about the life weight
machine learning implementation.

70
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,410
What we have done here's our approach.

71
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,740
Becoming truly innovative, our machine
learning model models consume just

72
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:36,040
four kb of memory while achieving 95%
detection accuracy for network anomalies.

73
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,720
Instead of relying on external
service, each device conduct

74
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,280
local real-time analysis.

75
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,320
We have implemented a distributed
intelligence model where insights

76
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,220
are shared across the network
through federated learning,

77
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,230
ensuring continuous improvement.

78
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:59,500
Without compromising data privacy,
adaptive thresholds, and automatically

79
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,940
calibrate based on the environment,
conditions, and network traffic

80
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,830
dynamically reducing the false
positives while maintaining

81
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,110
the subsecond detection speed.

82
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,480
Let's talk about the
performance benchmark.

83
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:15,660
Now.

84
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,765
Our frameworks dynamically
outperform traditional approaches.

85
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:26,685
We have achieved 90% faster recovery times
triple battery life and improved packet

86
00:06:26,895 --> 00:06:35,455
delivery reliability by 14%, all while
using only 25% of, memory of conventional

87
00:06:35,844 --> 00:06:37,255
by using conventional methods.

88
00:06:37,755 --> 00:06:40,905
Next, let's talk about the
architecture for scale.

89
00:06:41,895 --> 00:06:47,655
Our architecture is designed to manage
complexity at unpredictable scale.

90
00:06:48,315 --> 00:06:53,445
We can orchestrate thousands of BLE
device with zero touch provisioning

91
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,325
and automated firmware distribution.

92
00:06:56,925 --> 00:07:02,145
Advanced scheduling algorithms allow
10 to 20 concurrent BLE connections

93
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:04,155
per gateway with minimal latency.

94
00:07:04,635 --> 00:07:10,515
Arm meh coordination enables transparent
roaming with sub 50 millisecond handoff.

95
00:07:10,874 --> 00:07:15,224
Between coverage zones, ensuring
uninterrupted operations.

96
00:07:15,724 --> 00:07:19,174
Now let's talk about code
implementation and examples.

97
00:07:19,674 --> 00:07:23,724
We have created a comprehensive
open source code base that delivers

98
00:07:24,715 --> 00:07:28,284
production ready implementation of
BLE, connection management, anomaly

99
00:07:28,284 --> 00:07:33,190
detection, power optimization, and
memory efficient package handling.

100
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,190
Our goal.

101
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,910
Is to solve the most challenging aspect
of resilient iot development with

102
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:46,780
minimal integration efforts, empowering
developers to build more robust networks.

103
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,299
So now let's talk about
the real world application.

104
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:57,749
Using these methods, let me illustrate our
framework impact across diverse scenarios.

105
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:01,119
In industry automation,
we have maintained.

106
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:04,989
We are maintaining 99.9% uptime.

107
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:09,849
Our mission critical equipments
monitoring is high interference and

108
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:11,589
in high interference environment.

109
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:19,389
Some cities, can now manage vast sensor
networks with self diagnosed capabilities

110
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:23,739
that reduces maintenance visits by 78%.

111
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:28,840
Healthcare monitoring benefits from
uninterrupted patient data streams

the key, takeaways and the next

116
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,950
steps and the future directions.

117
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,960
Modern programming has fundamentally
transformed network resilience.

118
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,340
We have proven that resource
constraint devices can implement, can

119
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:02,990
implement sophisticated self-healing
mechanisms without compromising

120
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,670
performance or battery life.

121
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,890
Machine learning is now
practical on low power devices.

122
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,460
Adaptive power management
techniques allows extended device

123
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,920
functionality without sacrificing.
