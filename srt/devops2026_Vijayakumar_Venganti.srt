00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,199
Speaker 47: Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,980
Welcome to Zero Trust Security in DevOps.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,219
Automating test verification
across 5G Pipeline.

4
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:09,949
I'm VI Marvin Genti.

5
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:14,779
And today we'll explore how zero
trust transforms security in

6
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:17,450
fast moving 5G DevOps environment

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,920
with 5G connections
exceeding projections and.

8
00:00:21,265 --> 00:00:26,334
Cybersecurity threats evolving very
rapidly, including AA driven attacks.

9
00:00:27,175 --> 00:00:29,334
Traditional perimeter
security is obsolete.

10
00:00:29,995 --> 00:00:35,775
Zero trust is now the baseline with
over 60% of organizations adopting

11
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:38,955
it and plans for 81% by year end.

12
00:00:39,455 --> 00:00:45,055
According to recent surveys, this approach
enables secure high velocity deployments

13
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:47,214
without compromising project protection.

14
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:54,164
Now I will cover the security imperative,
the core paradox, why legacy models fail,

15
00:00:54,584 --> 00:00:59,684
zero trust fundamentals, embedding in
pipelines, the four layer architecture,

16
00:00:59,714 --> 00:01:05,414
CICD implementation, 5G integration
challenges, and finally, real world

17
00:01:05,444 --> 00:01:07,035
insights and future directions.

18
00:01:07,755 --> 00:01:08,265
Let's begin.

19
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:12,360
In the world where we live in security
is no more a check, just a checkbox.

20
00:01:13,294 --> 00:01:17,464
It's enabler of innovation
in a high connected world.

21
00:01:17,964 --> 00:01:24,545
The rapid adoption of DevOps in 5G has
transformed security industry, software

22
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:28,085
delivery, but it introduces massive risks.

23
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:32,345
Organizations now deploy
code multiple times a day.

24
00:01:32,845 --> 00:01:34,524
Compressing security reviews.

25
00:01:35,024 --> 00:01:38,894
Key issues are these
development velocity pressures.

26
00:01:38,894 --> 00:01:43,454
Team expands, attack
surfaces with each push.

27
00:01:43,954 --> 00:01:46,594
Hence, continuous verification
is very essential.

28
00:01:47,094 --> 00:01:52,645
Perimeter security assumes threats
stay outside, but in cloud native

29
00:01:52,704 --> 00:01:55,224
architecture, that boundary has dissolved.

30
00:01:55,724 --> 00:02:01,964
Recent study highlights that 70% of 5G
networks still face misconfiguration

31
00:02:01,964 --> 00:02:07,515
vulnerabilities often from
unverified access in dynamic steps.

32
00:02:08,014 --> 00:02:12,034
5G distributed nature with edge
computing, network slicing and

33
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:15,365
massive iot demands a paradigm shift.

34
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:17,165
No more relying on perimeter.

35
00:02:17,665 --> 00:02:22,720
DevOps team faced A paradox rapid
cycles conflict with thorough

36
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,450
validation with expanded attack surface.

37
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,940
This is even intensified in five G's
complex and foster infrastructure

38
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,010
where infrastructure completely
multiplies exponentially.

39
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,185
Why traditional models fail?

40
00:02:38,015 --> 00:02:43,015
Because legacy assumptions break down
traditional perimeter based fails.

41
00:02:43,075 --> 00:02:48,555
As it assumes threats are coming from
outside, but this perimeter trust becomes

42
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:55,665
invalid in multi-cloud 5G for instance,
Ericson notes that zero trust matches 5G.

43
00:02:55,665 --> 00:02:59,985
By eliminating implicit trust,
reducing lateral movement by

44
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,230
up to 80% in enterprise setups.

45
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,690
Static rule-based access control
can't adapt to constantly

46
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,830
changing infrastructure.

47
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:13,160
One time authentication leaves
unverified windows and lateral

48
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,840
movement goes undetected.

49
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:20,010
Once inside a private 5G penetration test
case study revealed that without zero

50
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:26,010
trust, industrial networks were vulnerable
to insider threats in under 30 minutes.

51
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:31,040
Zero Trust is a security model
built on simple but powerful idea.

52
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:37,600
Never trust, always verify Key
principles of zero Trust are every

53
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,795
user, device, and service must
be continuously authenticated,

54
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:45,315
authorized, continuously validated.

55
00:03:45,815 --> 00:03:49,755
It assumes attackers are
inside the system already.

56
00:03:50,255 --> 00:03:54,425
So you design your system
to limit blast radius.

57
00:03:54,815 --> 00:03:58,505
Detect anonymous quickly,
and respond instantly.

58
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:04,875
This philosophy designs systems to
contain compromises immediately as per

59
00:04:05,535 --> 00:04:08,565
NIST and CISA guidelines of 5G clouds.

60
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:13,695
Zero Trust reduces breach impact
by focusing on data and apps.

61
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:20,155
Integrate zero trust into CI CD pipelines
by automating verification at every stage.

62
00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:22,525
No manual bottlenecks.

63
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:26,965
That means at code level
that is sign every commit.

64
00:04:27,865 --> 00:04:33,385
Run static analysis, scan
dependencies, and at container level

65
00:04:34,105 --> 00:04:37,740
image scanning, verify provenance.

66
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,990
Apply runtime policy and at
the infrastructure level,

67
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,280
validate infrastructure as
a code, detect configuration

68
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,220
drift, and enforce immutability.

69
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,470
And finally, at the network
level service mesh with mutual

70
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,860
TLS enforce MIS segmentation.

71
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,700
The key is automation manual review
won't work anymore at this scale.

72
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,030
We need automated consistent checks
that execute at mission speed.

73
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,820
Propose this four layer approach,
which addresses challenges of securing

74
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,805
DevOps workflows in 5G environments,
the access layer, transport layer,

75
00:05:18,465 --> 00:05:22,635
policy intelligence layer, and
control, and orchestration layer.

76
00:05:23,135 --> 00:05:27,025
The access layer start with
continuous identity verifications

77
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:29,695
with multi-factor authentication.

78
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:32,925
Mutual TLS container attestation.

79
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:37,085
Run time monitoring, behavioral
analysis, detect anomalies.

80
00:05:38,015 --> 00:05:40,610
Recent a advances a integrates device.

81
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,370
Posture for decision, as
in Palo Alto Networks.

82
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:43,810
Nvidia.

83
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,850
A factory integration for
zero Trust in edge ai.

84
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:53,380
The next layer is transport and
segmentation layer prevents lateral

85
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:59,500
movement via 5G slicing policies,
zero trust gateways, ai analyze

86
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,500
traffic, auto blocks, anomalies.

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,530
Best of practice, microsegmentation,
isolates, workloads.

88
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,120
The next layer is policy
and inte intelligence layer.

89
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,800
AI driven decisions making uses
AI baselines and alarm detection,

90
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,820
dynamic policies, auto containment.

91
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,255
It uses adaptive security
ecosystem to continuously learn

92
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,635
normal behavioral patterns.

93
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:31,135
For users, services and infrastructure,
any deviation from these baselines

94
00:06:31,135 --> 00:06:33,895
will be detected as potential threats.

95
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:39,275
Once threats are detected, it adapts
policies in real time, a powered zero

96
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:46,075
trust for 5G slices, managers, dynamic
security without performance hit the loss

97
00:06:46,075 --> 00:06:48,475
layer, control and orchestration layer.

98
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:53,865
This layer governs centralized
policy with distributed environment.

99
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:59,045
Central government is like a centralized
zero trust controller, which is AI

100
00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:06,125
powered identity and access management
with policy as a code immutable

101
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:11,845
audits for every run by providing a
feedback loop so that a risk insights

102
00:07:12,235 --> 00:07:14,125
directly update the security posture.

103
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:20,175
This overall four layer approach ensures
distributed enforcement for resilience.

104
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:22,295
You can't trust what you can't see.

105
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:28,255
This layer gives you total visibility,
zero trust implementation in CICD

106
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:30,535
workflows, embedded every stage.

107
00:07:31,315 --> 00:07:35,845
Signed commits, secret
scanning, container analysis.

108
00:07:36,345 --> 00:07:39,995
A SC validation, air and
AMI detection, practical.

109
00:07:40,495 --> 00:07:44,965
Remove static credentials and
automate checks for every deployment.

110
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,835
Create an immutable chain of custody.

111
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:51,994
Each step creates cryptographic attention.

112
00:07:51,994 --> 00:07:52,205
Attention.

113
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,734
Forming a trusted chain from
developer to production.

114
00:07:56,234 --> 00:07:58,754
Zero trust integration with 5G networks.

115
00:07:59,114 --> 00:08:04,114
Leverage 5G slicing for pipeline
isolation, edge intelligence for

116
00:08:04,114 --> 00:08:08,425
low latency detection, continuous
device authentication and isolation.

117
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:13,455
C. SG recommends zero trust
for CSPs to master 5G.

118
00:08:13,634 --> 00:08:14,354
Security

119
00:08:14,854 --> 00:08:17,045
implementation challenges and limitations.

120
00:08:17,545 --> 00:08:21,505
Some of the challenges are
operational complexity, ai attack

121
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:26,785
surfaces, performance, overhead
skills, gap and cultural shift.

122
00:08:27,285 --> 00:08:29,595
Address these with the
training and phase adoption.

123
00:08:30,255 --> 00:08:35,420
It's not just about the tools, it's
about mindset, skillset, and discip.

124
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,600
To wrap up, zero.

125
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,309
Trust is no longer an optional.

126
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:43,150
It's a foundational for 5G
and cloud-native DevOps.

127
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,930
It enables fast, safe deployments.

128
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,800
It minimizes blast radius.

129
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:54,030
It accelerate accelerates
automated response.

130
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,320
The future is self-healing systems.

131
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,640
Quantum safe, crypto verified
policy correctness zero.

132
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,230
Trust is not in a destination.

133
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:10,310
It's a mindset, a continuous
process, and it's your best defense.

134
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,970
With this conclusion, I'll end my session.

135
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,750
