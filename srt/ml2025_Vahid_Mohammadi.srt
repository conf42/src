00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:02,610
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,950
Hope all you guys are well.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:12,600
My name is Vahid from University of TD
and International Student Recruitment

4
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:19,060
services company based in the uk
and we recruit the students from all

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,499
over the world to study in the uk.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,130
So if you want to study
in the uk, just join us.

7
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:26,830
Okay.

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,090
Let's go.

9
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:33,555
It's wonderful being with you today.

10
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:38,725
I'd like to start with something
we all know artificial intelligence

11
00:00:38,785 --> 00:00:40,975
which is no longer the future.

12
00:00:41,455 --> 00:00:46,684
It's already a big part of our
lives and it's not going anywhere.

13
00:00:47,535 --> 00:00:52,955
Whether we like it or not AI is
changing how we live, how we work,

14
00:00:52,955 --> 00:00:55,565
how we learn, even how we think.

15
00:00:56,105 --> 00:00:59,015
And in education, this
change is happening fast.

16
00:00:59,715 --> 00:01:04,075
Students all over the world are
using ai in their studies today.

17
00:01:04,405 --> 00:01:05,815
All of us know.

18
00:01:06,745 --> 00:01:09,875
And the question is, are
they using it properly?

19
00:01:12,215 --> 00:01:12,755
Okay.

20
00:01:12,755 --> 00:01:20,625
A global survey by the digital digital
Education Council in July, 2024, which

21
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:28,885
included more than 3,800 students
from 16 countries found that 86% of

22
00:01:28,885 --> 00:01:30,955
the students use AI in their studies.

23
00:01:31,345 --> 00:01:37,135
And more than half of them
do so on a Bay Weekly basis.

24
00:01:39,385 --> 00:01:46,305
Most of the students say they use
AI to research for information

25
00:01:46,825 --> 00:01:48,595
mainly to write assignments.

26
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:57,780
About 86% 60, sorry, 66% said they
used chat g Pity, showing just how

27
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,090
prevalent the use of this tool has been.

28
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,800
An additional report by Status
Star published in August, 2024.

29
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,220
Also included about two months
late after, after two months.

30
00:02:11,895 --> 00:02:18,305
About previous survey also concluded
that 86% of college students

31
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,695
use AI tools for their studies.

32
00:02:22,115 --> 00:02:27,484
These statistics are attempting
to inform us about something.

33
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:33,965
AI is already a big part of
education, but here the question,

34
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:40,234
are students using AI to learn or
are they using to replace learning?

35
00:02:41,225 --> 00:02:43,025
That's the question, that's the concern.

36
00:02:43,475 --> 00:02:51,005
Too many students with AI to do
the work for them to do assignments

37
00:02:51,095 --> 00:02:58,434
instead of as a tool to help and
empower them to think and create.

38
00:02:59,164 --> 00:03:01,579
This is where the concern begins.

39
00:03:03,929 --> 00:03:08,639
Today I want to talk about this
concerns, but also the potential

40
00:03:09,779 --> 00:03:11,819
of the other concerns as well.

41
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:16,679
Because when when used in the
right way, AI can enhance a

42
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:18,539
student, not replace universities.

43
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:20,059
Let's explore how

44
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:25,074
ai detectors AI detectors.

45
00:03:25,554 --> 00:03:29,454
Maybe many, you, many
of you guys know or not.

46
00:03:29,514 --> 00:03:33,804
Programs designed to establish
whether a written work was

47
00:03:33,804 --> 00:03:39,324
produced or with the assistance
of artificial intelligence or not.

48
00:03:39,684 --> 00:03:45,624
And these programs have been installed
by the majority of the schools, majority

49
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:47,514
of profit university professors.

50
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:53,184
These programs like ING,
GPT Zero Regionality.

51
00:03:53,799 --> 00:04:00,819
And even Grammarly now are employed by the
majority to check essay and assignments.

52
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:07,809
Now, I'm not here to argue about whether
these detectors are always correct.

53
00:04:08,529 --> 00:04:15,519
We know that they're not sick, honestly,
and we already know they have so many

54
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:19,509
problems and issues to detect the ai.

55
00:04:19,869 --> 00:04:21,579
They frequently get it wrong.

56
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,749
And even human written
stuff gets called hunting.

57
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,469
But again they may get
wrong, but this is the truth.

58
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:36,219
Most professors don't
depend on detectors only

59
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:42,279
because they already know about
AI detectors problems or possible

60
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,719
problems on something like that.

61
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,659
And.

62
00:04:47,214 --> 00:04:51,834
They con, they contrast the
students' recent writing with

63
00:04:51,894 --> 00:04:53,754
what they've written before.

64
00:04:56,674 --> 00:05:04,214
They check their references as sites
because AI programs such GGPT tend

65
00:05:04,214 --> 00:05:06,584
to use fictional or Foster Francis.

66
00:05:06,614 --> 00:05:06,914
Indeed.

67
00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:13,039
A study recently conducted reported
that just 7% of chat g PT generated

68
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:15,859
references were accurate and verifiable.

69
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:21,879
They also search for suspicious
patterns excessively formal tone,

70
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:28,819
absence of personal voice or academic
terminology that does not fit the

71
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:31,189
students' normal styles that they know.

72
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:37,214
Even some teachers talk with the
students about how they write with them

73
00:05:37,214 --> 00:05:44,324
to see if they actually wrote or wrote
it or just submitted what AI offered.

74
00:05:45,764 --> 00:05:47,924
So what did the student do?

75
00:05:49,644 --> 00:05:57,904
Another hack arrived after so
many problems, AI humanizer.

76
00:05:58,954 --> 00:05:59,704
Okay, let's.

77
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:00,409
Talk.

78
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:02,119
What is ai humanize?

79
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:08,789
Ai humanizes are softwares that
makes material written by AI and

80
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:15,779
rewards, rewards it so it sounds more
human, and we can call it humanized.

81
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:16,079
Nice.

82
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:21,259
They attempt to fool AI detectors
by changing sentence sentence

83
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:27,414
structure tone and vocabulary
even, or rephrase, paraphrase.

84
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:33,144
And in the majority of cases they
have succeeded, to be honest.

85
00:06:33,174 --> 00:06:38,404
They have succeeded and
they've imposed on the system.

86
00:06:40,664 --> 00:06:42,254
But there is a real question.

87
00:06:42,314 --> 00:06:44,084
Did they make a difference?

88
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:46,334
Professors still call it out.

89
00:06:47,114 --> 00:06:53,174
They sense the disconnect in tone,
the lack of through thinking and that

90
00:06:53,174 --> 00:06:58,594
this, the disparity between the voice
of this student and the end result.

91
00:07:00,274 --> 00:07:06,594
And more importantly students,
don students themselves know when

92
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:08,604
they did not actually do the work,

93
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:12,774
let's something else.

94
00:07:13,374 --> 00:07:22,134
Even if the assignments is not called
if if it wasn't written by the students.

95
00:07:24,324 --> 00:07:25,464
Let's think about that.

96
00:07:26,064 --> 00:07:26,844
That's not fair.

97
00:07:27,564 --> 00:07:28,284
It's not fair.

98
00:07:28,794 --> 00:07:30,144
There's no learning involved.

99
00:07:31,014 --> 00:07:36,474
Universities have different
policies, actually different

100
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:40,369
policies, and let me show you.

101
00:07:40,369 --> 00:07:40,379
Okay.

102
00:07:41,404 --> 00:07:43,984
Students, universities
have different policies.

103
00:07:44,794 --> 00:07:47,344
Some of them ban AI use entirely.

104
00:07:47,404 --> 00:07:48,394
Others allow it, but.

105
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:50,579
Only if the students disclose it.

106
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,799
It's a controversial topic.

107
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:03,869
Some professors view AI use as a cheating
while other view it as a chance to learn.

108
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:09,599
I remember one educator suggested
recently, instead of putting

109
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:15,029
detection front and center, let's
change the way we design assignments.

110
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:20,809
Make them personal, reflective
or event event driven.

111
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,740
Let's make it harder
to outsource thinking.

112
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:27,494
And I think that's the answer.

113
00:08:28,304 --> 00:08:29,534
I think that's the answer.

114
00:08:29,984 --> 00:08:34,464
We shouldn't fear ai, but we
should fear a future where

115
00:08:34,464 --> 00:08:36,144
students do not think anymore.

116
00:08:37,314 --> 00:08:43,554
So now the question is, what is the
right approach to using AI in education?

117
00:08:44,944 --> 00:08:50,254
How do we move from
replacement to empowerment?

118
00:08:50,914 --> 00:08:51,154
Okay.

119
00:08:51,154 --> 00:08:55,965
Let's discuss about that in next.

120
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:03,255
Let's pause a MO for a moment
and imagine a different world.

121
00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:10,305
A word where students don't use AI
to escape learning, but to deepen it,

122
00:09:11,505 --> 00:09:18,075
imagine students asking AI not to write
their assignment, but to show them how

123
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:27,705
to write, imagine, and AI that teaches
them the structure of a strong say.

124
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:36,065
That explain what makes an introduction,
compelling how to organize arguments

125
00:09:36,095 --> 00:09:41,065
and how to critically analyze
a source, something like that.

126
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:47,575
Picture a student working on a
difficult assignments and instead

127
00:09:47,635 --> 00:09:52,045
of handing it off to ai, they ask.

128
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,935
I don't know how to start.

129
00:09:53,935 --> 00:09:56,455
Can you help me think it through?

130
00:09:57,145 --> 00:09:58,675
And the AI respond.

131
00:09:58,975 --> 00:09:59,875
Let's break it out.

132
00:10:00,115 --> 00:10:02,035
Let's break it down together.

133
00:10:02,755 --> 00:10:07,075
Here's what's unclear and
here's how we can fix it.

134
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:16,245
I like a trusted mentor, this AI gives
feedback, identifies weaknesses, and

135
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:18,555
guides the students step by step.

136
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,520
But never does the work for them.

137
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,050
I believe it's beautiful word, isn't it?

138
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:34,200
Imagine about this AI mentor, AI friend.

139
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:41,320
It's the world that real
educators carrying professors

140
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,410
and mentors already try to build.

141
00:10:45,115 --> 00:10:49,545
They they read every line
of a student's assignments.

142
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:55,275
They offer feedback not just
on grammar, but on ideas.

143
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:58,835
They don't just grade they guide.

144
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:03,635
Now imagine an AI that
assures the mission.

145
00:11:05,405 --> 00:11:10,865
This mission is, let's talk
one that, two different ais.

146
00:11:10,985 --> 00:11:14,495
One of that refuses to
do the work for you.

147
00:11:15,155 --> 00:11:21,595
Even if you ask another one says I
won't write this for you, but I learn,

148
00:11:21,775 --> 00:11:25,315
teach you how to become someone who can,

149
00:11:28,615 --> 00:11:30,925
this is no longer a tool control.

150
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,095
It's a friend.

151
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:40,210
A friend who has your back,
but also holds you accountable.

152
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,840
In this world, AI
doesn't replace learning.

153
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,600
It re reinforces it.

154
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:54,090
It pushes students to become independent
thinkers, strong writers, better

155
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,600
learners, and that's the shift we need.

156
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:06,865
From common and controlled AI to
collaborative, ethical, empowering ai

157
00:12:07,495 --> 00:12:14,635
let's stop asking AI to do our work and
start asking to help us do it better.

158
00:12:15,055 --> 00:12:15,295
Okay.

159
00:12:24,685 --> 00:12:27,655
Okay, so where does that leave us?

160
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:35,515
If we truly want AI to argue education
and not detract from it, we must rethink

161
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:37,375
our relationship with this technology.

162
00:12:37,835 --> 00:12:41,985
We need to move away from shortcuts.

163
00:12:42,315 --> 00:12:48,165
Away from plagiarism, away from
mindsets of let AI do it for me.

164
00:12:48,555 --> 00:12:52,930
Instead, let's help a student
see AI for what it should be.

165
00:12:53,945 --> 00:13:01,385
Powerful learning, power learning partner,
powerful learning friend, learning mentor,

166
00:13:01,805 --> 00:13:07,935
let's instruct students and encouraging
them, encourage them to use AI as a tool

167
00:13:07,935 --> 00:13:10,575
for exploration, feedback, and grow all.

168
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:13,095
And

169
00:13:13,235 --> 00:13:15,505
Yeah, to ask more more.

170
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,260
Informed questions to understand
their mistakes, to grow with with

171
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,200
each try not avoid the process.

172
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:33,180
For in for, in its sense, AI was never
meant to take the place of human learning.

173
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,450
It was designed to accelerate
human growth, right?

174
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,700
And educator education.

175
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:44,165
Real education isn't just about answers.

176
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:47,315
It's about a struggle, reflection, wonder.

177
00:13:47,835 --> 00:13:51,555
It's learning to think not what to say.

178
00:13:52,305 --> 00:13:56,325
And also, let's create
environments where students are

179
00:13:56,325 --> 00:13:58,515
not punished for leveraging ai.

180
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:04,545
What to learn to leverage its
responsibly, ethically, and creatively.

181
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,065
Let's give them to.

182
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:08,655
Competencies.

183
00:14:09,165 --> 00:14:09,975
The mindset.

184
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:16,185
Mindset and the confidence
to own their learning with

185
00:14:16,185 --> 00:14:18,985
the support of tools like ai.

186
00:14:19,555 --> 00:14:25,305
Because if we do, we not just
protecting the future of education,

187
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:29,235
we are taking it to a higher level.

188
00:14:30,405 --> 00:14:30,915
Okay?

189
00:14:32,295 --> 00:14:32,655
Yes.

190
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:38,935
This better word, we can make this
award and I think this word is possible.

191
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:41,345
Okay.

192
00:14:41,345 --> 00:14:42,545
What is the best part?

193
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,365
We are building it.

194
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:50,680
We are developing a new AI
powered platform in the ed tech

195
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,330
education technology space.

196
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:58,140
One that's not here to replace
educators or right assignments is

197
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,600
here to empower students to become.

198
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:07,810
Better thinkers and better
writers on this platform.

199
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:14,290
Every students gets their own AI
friend, a personalized academic guide.

200
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:19,200
They can name they can
interact with and grow on site.

201
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,870
This is more than a chat bot.

202
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,380
This is like an AI mentor.

203
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:33,000
Instructed not only by code, but by
actual academic professionals who

204
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,440
understand the struggles students
face with writing assignment.

205
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:45,570
TE is essay and academic articles
in the, and that's the point in,

206
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:51,360
in, in the first phase, this AI
friend will answer questions the

207
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,260
students have about academic writing.

208
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:01,720
Read their work and provide helpful
feedback, help them learn what went

209
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,210
wrong and how to read correctly.

210
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,200
Offer guidance instead
of something like hacks.

211
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:14,700
And most importantly,
don't do the work for them.

212
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,880
This AI doesn't attempt to be omniscient.

213
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,600
Omniscient

214
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,890
if it doesn't.

215
00:16:24,265 --> 00:16:25,495
Know a response.

216
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:26,995
It won't guess.

217
00:16:27,535 --> 00:16:29,575
Instead, it flags it.

218
00:16:30,045 --> 00:16:37,115
That a human academic admin okay,
can step it, teach the correct

219
00:16:37,115 --> 00:16:42,455
answer to this AI friend and
teach the AI and this ai friend.

220
00:16:42,455 --> 00:16:48,635
Learn it in time, this AI friend
will become better than the past.

221
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:57,980
It will become more intelligent and it'll
begin to customize the guidance based

222
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:05,630
on each student's university and in the
future, maybe even based on the specific

223
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,630
expectations of individual professors.

224
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,740
And imagine that's,

225
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,820
let's,

226
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:19,430
okay.

227
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,810
Imagine that.

228
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:25,190
A deeply knowledgeable, always
available ethical academic guide.

229
00:17:25,865 --> 00:17:31,055
Who knows your background, your
challenges, your goals, and is there

230
00:17:31,055 --> 00:17:33,335
to support you, not replacing you.

231
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:36,905
Yeah, we're not just building a tool.

232
00:17:36,965 --> 00:17:40,775
We are building trust,
accountability and growth.

233
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:45,215
We are not just implementing
AI in education.

234
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:49,420
We are fortifying education with ai.

235
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,170
And if we do it correctly, we'll
create a generation of learners who

236
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:05,190
don't just know how to write, but know
to how, and much know how to think,

237
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,010
how to question, how to ask a
question, how to ask a question

238
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,770
correctly, and how to innovate.

239
00:18:15,735 --> 00:18:18,495
Okay with AI as a facilitator.

240
00:18:18,525 --> 00:18:26,775
Facilitator, not an aid with AI
as a facilitator, not an eight.

241
00:18:29,415 --> 00:18:37,075
And this regional responsible empowering
AI in education isn't just theoretical.

242
00:18:38,815 --> 00:18:41,155
It's something we've started working on.

243
00:18:41,215 --> 00:18:42,505
We are building a platform.

244
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:48,880
Called estimate an academic support
system where the students are not just

245
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,740
user users of ai, but collaborators
in their own learning process.

246
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,670
The idea is a simple but powerful.

247
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,140
Every student is paired with AI companion
one they can name, talk, and grow with.

248
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:14,860
Not a tool to perform their work for
them, but a guide to help them learn to

249
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:22,250
do it for themselves in its initial phase,
asking addresses academic writing it

250
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:28,670
reads students drafts, offers constructive
feedbacks, detects weaknesses and offers.

251
00:19:29,205 --> 00:19:35,955
So many suggestions always based
on peda geological principles and

252
00:19:35,985 --> 00:19:38,235
never replacing the student's voice.

253
00:19:41,535 --> 00:19:48,125
What is the difference between
anate with all of the other ais?

254
00:19:48,905 --> 00:19:52,985
What makes Ased unique is the
manner in which it learns.

255
00:19:53,505 --> 00:20:01,555
It's not merely trained, but on the
base data or something like that, or

256
00:20:01,555 --> 00:20:05,635
search on the internet or learning
from the internet, but under human

257
00:20:05,635 --> 00:20:12,565
supervision by specialists in higher
studies and scholarly writing.

258
00:20:12,985 --> 00:20:19,165
If the AI hesitates on a question, it
doesn't provide a placeholder answer.

259
00:20:21,115 --> 00:20:23,425
No, not like other ais.

260
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,225
It flags the issue.

261
00:20:25,255 --> 00:20:33,775
And a human admin a step in not merely
to response correctly, V, but to teach

262
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:36,715
the AI how to respond in the future.

263
00:20:37,295 --> 00:20:41,240
This creates creates a model
in which the system grows.

264
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,150
Over the time, ethically, rightly,
and in the line with real academic

265
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,400
expectations, that's the point.

266
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:54,650
That's the right thing that universities,
or colleges or schools wants, or

267
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,230
professor wants or lecturer wants.

268
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:06,125
The ultimate vision is even broader
estimate comes of age with the students.

269
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:14,320
It'll eventually be capable of recognizing
institutional context, understanding

270
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,930
how expectations can differ between
universities or even between specific

271
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,830
structures and beyond beyond the academy.

272
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:29,830
It'll support the students through
daily challenges, finding housing,

273
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,190
navigating administrative procedures.

274
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,990
Adjusting to life abroad.

275
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,920
The hope is not perfection.

276
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,210
It's continually growth and trust.

277
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:51,900
Estimate isn't being built to
be the solution to all things.

278
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:55,110
It's being built to be a responsible.

279
00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:01,510
A responsible alley in a more complex
educational landscape, helping a

280
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:07,920
student not by doing the work for them,
but by accompanying upon accompanying

281
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:13,140
them this is one way we believe
AI can actually make a difference

282
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:19,080
in education, not by replacing the
work of students or teachers, but.

283
00:22:19,525 --> 00:22:27,035
By amplifying what makes them human
this isn't just a tool for students.

284
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:32,555
We are building estimate with the
clear intention of working alongside

285
00:22:32,555 --> 00:22:34,265
university, not around them.

286
00:22:35,045 --> 00:22:40,895
Our goal is to create a system that
academics, institutions can trust.

287
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:44,455
A system that encourages responsible A IU.

288
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,760
Which the university like that with
the colleges like that, which the

289
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:56,280
schools like that with the professors
and academic staff likes that.

290
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:01,170
We believe that if we do it,
do this correctly, universities

291
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:04,020
won't just adopt this AI friend.

292
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:09,510
They'll embrace it because it's
in line with their purpose.

293
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,270
It honors the.

294
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:17,975
Standards and it makes their
students more resilient.

295
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:24,535
That's the future we are working toward
one where technology and academia

296
00:23:24,595 --> 00:23:27,895
aren't at art, but in collaboration.

297
00:23:27,955 --> 00:23:29,095
Yes, that's the point.

298
00:23:29,725 --> 00:23:34,735
Thank you very much for your attention,
for your kind attention and hope to

299
00:23:34,735 --> 00:23:37,270
sue all of you guys in estimate and.

300
00:23:38,135 --> 00:23:44,855
Change the future of learning, future
of education in education technology.

301
00:23:45,035 --> 00:23:45,845
Thank you very much.
