1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,220
Good morning.

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,990
Good afternoon everyone.

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:09,510
My name is Rajni k I'm a senior support
communications manager at Snowflake.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,490
Welcome to this talk.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:17,280
This talk is about AI driven
customer experience, how to start

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,730
scale and succeed in the enterprise.

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,509
Let's get started.

8
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:23,339
Okay.

9
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:27,509
So customer experience
is rapidly changing.

10
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:34,779
Like all these companies and enterprises
were able to serve customers in a reactive

11
00:00:34,779 --> 00:00:41,740
mode until yesterday, meaning customers
if run into any problem, they'll come to.

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,960
The enterprise support portal, or
they'll call the customer service,

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,480
they'll open up a technical ticket
or support case with the company, and

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,250
then somebody will be looking into the
problem after they happen and then they

15
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,339
try to solve and help the customer.

16
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:06,009
So that was the yesterday scenario,
how the customer's experience was.

17
00:01:06,595 --> 00:01:13,145
And coming to today, in this, today's
years and world of ai practically

18
00:01:13,145 --> 00:01:18,785
anticipating customer needs even
before the customer asks, right?

19
00:01:18,785 --> 00:01:23,704
It's becoming increasingly
common by, by leveraging AI

20
00:01:23,704 --> 00:01:25,505
tooling and the technologies.

21
00:01:26,225 --> 00:01:29,225
So yet these AI tools are delivering.

22
00:01:30,139 --> 00:01:34,579
Delivering, sorry, personalized
experiences to millions of

23
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:38,479
people simultaneously in
real time across the globe.

24
00:01:38,529 --> 00:01:41,919
You take an example of retail
or healthcare or banking and

25
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:46,809
finance, whatever industry it
is, they are using AI to deliver

26
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:48,969
personalized experience at scale.

27
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:52,059
So I'll talk about that in the
upcoming slides and I'll show you some

28
00:01:52,059 --> 00:01:54,459
examples from different industries.

29
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:00,629
And also, yeah, mixing AI with the
human expertise is very important

30
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:02,309
not to replace the humans.

31
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,419
One has to leverage AI to amplify
that kind of an expertise from

32
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:08,919
the human side of the things.

33
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:12,259
So that's that, that's how
like the customer experience

34
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:14,329
is changing in today's world.

35
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:18,999
So here are the three pillars
of like artificial intelligence

36
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:20,709
driven customer experience.

37
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:24,809
The first pillar is hyper
hyper personalization.

38
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:29,169
Like tailoring experiences
to individuals based on their

39
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:32,049
preferences, behaviors, or context.

40
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:36,269
For example, if you take any
e-commerce business so like Amazon or.

41
00:02:37,084 --> 00:02:41,494
Any other e-commerce retail,
so they know like what the

42
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,714
customer's browsing history was.

43
00:02:43,714 --> 00:02:47,374
They know what the customers
purchased during what time, what

44
00:02:47,374 --> 00:02:51,604
they bought in the last winter, or
like what kind of a colors they like,

45
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:53,734
what kind of a models they like.

46
00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:55,204
So they know everything, right?

47
00:02:55,204 --> 00:02:56,764
They know everything about their customer.

48
00:02:57,304 --> 00:03:02,059
So by leveraging AI on top of
the data, whatever they have.

49
00:03:02,844 --> 00:03:05,694
They can personalize
everything to the customer.

50
00:03:05,724 --> 00:03:09,654
That particular customer, not 10 thousands
or a hundred thousands of customers.

51
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:14,034
It's personalized to that particular
individual who is browsing during

52
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:18,084
that moment, during that day,
during that festival season or

53
00:03:18,084 --> 00:03:19,584
holiday season, whatever it is.

54
00:03:20,084 --> 00:03:23,774
And the second pillar
is like intelligent ent.

55
00:03:24,165 --> 00:03:29,094
These AI powered reagents, like
they, they are very capable enough

56
00:03:29,094 --> 00:03:32,004
to try solving complex problems.

57
00:03:32,364 --> 00:03:34,045
They understand the patterns.

58
00:03:34,045 --> 00:03:34,944
Even if you have.

59
00:03:35,484 --> 00:03:39,624
Mountains of data, they know how to,
dig through the data and come up with

60
00:03:39,624 --> 00:03:45,624
like solutions with, for those complex
issues with mixing up with human empathy.

61
00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:49,894
So these are going to be very
powerful agents, these AI agents.

62
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:53,214
And the last one is
predictive insights, right?

63
00:03:53,214 --> 00:03:59,874
Anticipating needs and resolving any
issues that may happen even before

64
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:02,164
customers notices them, right?

65
00:04:02,194 --> 00:04:06,534
For example, in the, i in the
telecom industry if the company

66
00:04:06,804 --> 00:04:11,814
companies are using AI to
proactively monitor the signal drops.

67
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,954
Or if it is in fiber internet
or something, they even.

68
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:19,259
Getting to know if there are any
pockets, drops or something like that.

69
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,219
And then they are proactively
fixing those issues even before

70
00:04:23,249 --> 00:04:24,779
the customer noticing them.

71
00:04:24,809 --> 00:04:27,489
So that's pretty solid pillar.

72
00:04:27,549 --> 00:04:30,149
For the, aI driven customer experience.

73
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:32,899
Alright, let's go to the next one.

74
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:37,239
And the next one is an example
from the retail industry.

75
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:41,519
I talked about this a little bit in
the previous one as I said if you

76
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,484
take a real world scenario as soon
as a customer walks into your store

77
00:04:45,544 --> 00:04:47,554
or they started browsing online.

78
00:04:48,174 --> 00:04:49,224
Shopping online.

79
00:04:49,224 --> 00:04:54,534
So AI recognizes who that customer
is and what their browsing history

80
00:04:54,954 --> 00:04:58,414
and what kind of purchase patterns
the customer had in the past.

81
00:04:58,984 --> 00:05:02,524
And then they'll there, and then
they'll provide those recommendations

82
00:05:02,524 --> 00:05:04,234
based on all these points.

83
00:05:04,864 --> 00:05:11,269
And the second one is the AI will enable
dynamic pricing for the customer based on

84
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,009
their individual preference and demand.

85
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:17,504
It's not like a. Generic solution
or 20% off across all the

86
00:05:17,504 --> 00:05:18,764
customers or something like that.

87
00:05:19,124 --> 00:05:25,514
But it's basically pointing or
categor like delivering the pricing

88
00:05:25,514 --> 00:05:30,344
strategy exclusively designed
for that particularly individual

89
00:05:30,344 --> 00:05:32,024
during that day, during that time.

90
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,929
During that holiday season.

91
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:36,239
So that's the hyper
personalization in retail.

92
00:05:37,109 --> 00:05:41,309
And the third one again, as I said
showing product recommendations

93
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:42,149
based on the weather.

94
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:48,354
Hey, this customer has purchased a winter
jacket during last year, during November.

95
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:53,434
And if the customer is browsing during
November, but this year around the

96
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:57,754
same time, probably let's show him
like some different winter jackets

97
00:05:57,754 --> 00:06:02,554
based on his color references, based on
his choices that he made in the past.

98
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:06,314
So that's hyper-personalization that
we are talking about, and this is

99
00:06:06,314 --> 00:06:12,804
all made possible because of, like
using AI into the regular workflows.

100
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:17,224
So that's the power of AI and
coming to the hyper-personalization.

101
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:20,004
And if you take finance
or healthcare, right?

102
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:24,204
So finance financial services
are like companies who

103
00:06:24,204 --> 00:06:26,184
offers like investment plans.

104
00:06:26,524 --> 00:06:29,434
They are basically using AI to tailor.

105
00:06:29,754 --> 00:06:33,624
Tyler to provide a tailored approach
based on the risk tolerance of the

106
00:06:33,624 --> 00:06:36,174
individual based on their personal goals.

107
00:06:36,484 --> 00:06:39,604
Based on the, based on like
their age, where they are in

108
00:06:39,604 --> 00:06:41,584
their life during wall stage.

109
00:06:42,124 --> 00:06:46,144
And, like it's a powered personal
financial advisor for that particular

110
00:06:46,144 --> 00:06:48,184
design, exclusively for that individual.

111
00:06:48,454 --> 00:06:53,224
Based on these, all these factors,
a 25 year world startup founder.

112
00:06:53,634 --> 00:06:57,204
Maybe looking at the different
options compared to a 55-year-old

113
00:06:57,204 --> 00:06:58,944
person who is nearing retirement.

114
00:06:59,274 --> 00:07:04,624
So the system understands using the ai
about the, about all these like data

115
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:09,604
points, and then comes up with the,
like financial plan, investment plan

116
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:13,054
exclusively designed for that particular
customer based on all these factors.

117
00:07:13,554 --> 00:07:14,604
That's about finance.

118
00:07:14,604 --> 00:07:17,154
And if you come to healthcare,
again, the same thing.

119
00:07:17,664 --> 00:07:23,064
AI is powering, delivering care at
speed based on the medical history,

120
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:27,124
previous, past episodes of the
customer their references, their

121
00:07:27,124 --> 00:07:30,894
demographics, or if they, based on,
even based on their literacy level.

122
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:35,014
Because some of the educational
materials they are very important

123
00:07:35,014 --> 00:07:36,154
for the patients, let's say.

124
00:07:36,604 --> 00:07:40,504
If your patient knows that, if they're
the first time diabetic patient, they

125
00:07:40,504 --> 00:07:43,684
wanted to understand what are the,
some of the things that they have to

126
00:07:43,684 --> 00:07:48,034
take care and what are the dietary
plans and all this kind of stuff.

127
00:07:48,364 --> 00:07:50,524
If you just hand out your education.

128
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:54,464
Educational papers or something like
that, that they have to go through, it

129
00:07:54,464 --> 00:07:56,384
would be difficult for them to understand.

130
00:07:56,594 --> 00:07:58,724
So that's where the AI can help you.

131
00:07:59,034 --> 00:08:03,564
Like based on all this information
to serve patients better based

132
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:08,374
on all these, like inputs it's
exclusively like patient-centric.

133
00:08:08,684 --> 00:08:12,084
I, as we know it's not like
one size fits all, right?

134
00:08:12,084 --> 00:08:12,694
It has to be.

135
00:08:13,464 --> 00:08:14,064
Category.

136
00:08:14,064 --> 00:08:18,244
It has to be specially designed for
that particular patient based on all

137
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:19,954
these factors that we talked about.

138
00:08:20,524 --> 00:08:21,844
So that's another example.

139
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:24,704
In the healthcare we talked about
retail, finance, and healthcare.

140
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,899
So in the next slide, probably I'll
talk through the case study that

141
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:33,559
we work at Snowflake for processing
thousands of customer satisfaction

142
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,089
feedbacks that are coming in.

143
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:39,449
So the part one in this particular
slide I'll explain the challenge

144
00:08:39,449 --> 00:08:42,569
that we have faced, and in the
next slide I'll talk about the

145
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:43,949
solution that we have put together.

146
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:44,659
Okay.

147
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:47,249
The challenge was, as I said as soon as.

148
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,230
Like a support ticket is closed.

149
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,680
We ask, or we send a survey link
to our customers, ask them to

150
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,060
provide their feedback, right?

151
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,160
Based on the service
that they have received.

152
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,750
And as part of the survey, we are
providing a open text form, open text

153
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,020
box, asking them to provide their response
whatever they're thinking about the

154
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:10,010
survey, and if they would like to see
any improvements or if they wanted to

155
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,840
understand why certain feature is designed
in such a way or something like that.

156
00:09:14,195 --> 00:09:17,415
Or even if they wanted to say
thank you to the customer engineer,

157
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:19,635
whoever helped them to fix the issue.

158
00:09:19,785 --> 00:09:23,085
So that's the kind of open text box
that we are putting in the survey form

159
00:09:23,475 --> 00:09:27,415
and asking our customers to fill the
form as soon as they have some time.

160
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:31,495
So we are receiving definitely
responses thousands of responses

161
00:09:31,495 --> 00:09:33,415
are coming in every week.

162
00:09:33,835 --> 00:09:38,865
And we are a we have a team of
three and manually going through

163
00:09:38,865 --> 00:09:42,525
each of those responses and
categorizing them by sentiment like

164
00:09:42,525 --> 00:09:44,145
positive, negative, or neutral.

165
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,235
And also mapping them to issue type.

166
00:09:47,665 --> 00:09:49,285
Like this is a product feature issue.

167
00:09:49,335 --> 00:09:51,345
This is a service quality issue.

168
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,250
Or this is a technical issue,
something like that, right?

169
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,800
So we need to bucket those feedbacks
into various issue types so that we can

170
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,030
have some kind of a closed loop process
so that we can fix those issues and

171
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,330
improve our overall customer satisfaction.

172
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:11,400
So manually categorizing those thousands
of feedbacks that are coming in and

173
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,450
putting them into various sentiments
and issue types is a very tedious tasks.

174
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,770
Literally it takes weeks.

175
00:10:17,815 --> 00:10:21,475
If we are receiving thousands of
feedbacks this week to process those

176
00:10:21,475 --> 00:10:26,575
thousands of feedback manually, it takes
weeks for a team of three or team of

177
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:29,725
anybody to to, do that kind of a work.

178
00:10:30,155 --> 00:10:35,120
So of course, like the teams were
burned out doing a repetitive heavy

179
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,215
manual data entry kind of a work.

180
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,860
It's not going to scale out, and
it's by the time the feedback

181
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,960
reached to the particular team
it's already scaled out, right?

182
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,200
We cannot really make use of the feedback.

183
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,160
So that's the problem that we, we dealt
with in my company where I work right now.

184
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,760
And let me show you the solution, right?

185
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,360
What's the solution that we came up?

186
00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:00,410
Of course we used the ai but what we
did was like, we plugged the AI into

187
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,850
the whole workflow, as I said, like we
have a platform survey platform that is

188
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,615
getting all the survey responses and we
are feeding the survey responses into

189
00:11:08,615 --> 00:11:12,290
your snowflake table, capturing that
information into your snowflake table.

190
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,980
And then we have plugged in
the AI deployed AI model.

191
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:25,055
To read all those, like feedbacks and at
scale and classify them into sentiments,

192
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,035
into issue types and everything right.

193
00:11:27,035 --> 00:11:27,635
At scale.

194
00:11:27,635 --> 00:11:29,745
We don't need to manually do this.

195
00:11:29,805 --> 00:11:30,195
Yeah.

196
00:11:30,225 --> 00:11:31,905
The workflow will automatically.

197
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,300
Call the ai model a AI function, and
then it'll process all those feedbacks

198
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,400
we, which were came in the last
week and automatically process them.

199
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,570
So what's the result?

200
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,600
Earlier it used to take weeks,
as I said, like to process

201
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,920
those thousands of feedbacks.

202
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,420
Now it is, AI is doing it in overnight,
maybe within hour, within few hours.

203
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,450
So that's a tremendous change from
the effort standpoint, and then it's,

204
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:02,225
it is definitely saving millions of
dollars by, like eliminating that kind

205
00:12:02,225 --> 00:12:07,820
of manual work and freeing up the teams
so that the teams can free up from

206
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,710
that kind of a robot type of work.

207
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:15,975
And better utilize that time in strategic
problem solving, building relationships,

208
00:12:16,305 --> 00:12:19,665
and working with cross-functional teams
to actually implement the feedback that

209
00:12:19,665 --> 00:12:21,485
we are receiving from our customers.

210
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,065
So what's the end result here?

211
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:27,695
Of course, we have an improved
csat customer satisfaction.

212
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,355
And also pretty faster
response times, right?

213
00:12:31,355 --> 00:12:35,975
We don't need to wait for weeks and
we can solve those issues pretty fast.

214
00:12:36,365 --> 00:12:38,765
And also happier teams, right?

215
00:12:38,765 --> 00:12:42,835
So even like the internal teams are pretty
happy because they get to see the customer

216
00:12:43,315 --> 00:12:47,155
responses, customer feedback in any
faster time so that they can act on it.

217
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:48,875
Then they can close the loop.

218
00:12:49,415 --> 00:12:51,035
That's this kind of a solution.

219
00:12:51,475 --> 00:12:53,545
So again, like we didn't
build it from the scratch.

220
00:12:53,545 --> 00:12:58,815
We used our existing workflow and instead
of doing a manual categorization, we

221
00:12:58,815 --> 00:13:03,225
have we have plugged in an AI model a
classification model into the existing

222
00:13:03,225 --> 00:13:07,315
workflow, which is like reading,
feeding sorry, reading the data from

223
00:13:07,315 --> 00:13:11,575
a snowflake table and processing it
and putting it into another table.

224
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:16,125
And then that table is of course having
all the information, the sentiment and the

225
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,565
issue type, categorization, everything.

226
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:24,015
And so this entire workflow is
scheduled to run every week.

227
00:13:24,065 --> 00:13:25,655
We don't need to do anything every week.

228
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:30,295
Midnight Sunday night, it kicks off and
it starts processing all that information

229
00:13:30,295 --> 00:13:35,575
by Monday morning as soon as the teams are
in, and they will be able to see all the

230
00:13:35,605 --> 00:13:37,615
information and start working on those.

231
00:13:38,135 --> 00:13:40,025
Yeah, this is very useful.

232
00:13:40,545 --> 00:13:42,915
Our teams are happy, as I
said, like we are using it.

233
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,895
In our company right now,
and it's pretty good.

234
00:13:45,895 --> 00:13:46,795
It's going pretty good.

235
00:13:47,555 --> 00:13:50,355
And like even when it comes
to in this slide, right?

236
00:13:50,355 --> 00:13:54,915
Even it comes to we, we all, at
some point in time in interacted

237
00:13:54,915 --> 00:13:56,825
with chatbots for sure, right?

238
00:13:56,825 --> 00:13:57,905
These chat bots, right?

239
00:13:57,905 --> 00:14:00,815
The traditional chat bots,
more or less are designed to.

240
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:06,320
Answer frequently asked questions
based off of script based responses.

241
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,580
Something like, what are your store hours?

242
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,350
Or what's your written policy?

243
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,100
Or something like that, right?

244
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,105
So immediately there will be.

245
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,360
There will be an answer
available based on a script.

246
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,845
So it's a traditional chat bot
that we have that we are we have

247
00:14:19,845 --> 00:14:21,395
all seen, and interacted with.

248
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,615
But AI has changed that
game as well, right?

249
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:28,215
So the modern AI agents are
so powerful and they're pretty

250
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:29,985
good at solving complex issues.

251
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,370
And, like understanding the context,
the full context, what the customer

252
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:39,980
is talking about, and they can also
signal the customer frustration and

253
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,780
like they, they try to, empathetically
respond back to the customer based on the

254
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,250
questions that the customers are asking.

255
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,500
And even it can pull in a human, right?

256
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,680
If it cannot solve.

257
00:14:51,095 --> 00:14:52,655
The problem there and itself.

258
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:57,695
And it'll provide the full context
to human and then the human can pick

259
00:14:57,695 --> 00:14:59,495
it up there and there itself, right?

260
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:02,435
Without needing to go back, start
over everything from the beginning.

261
00:15:02,855 --> 00:15:05,165
So that's the power of modern AI agents.

262
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:07,405
So just to give you an example, right?

263
00:15:07,405 --> 00:15:07,765
If you.

264
00:15:08,605 --> 00:15:13,505
Look at any airline if you missed
your flight, and then you are

265
00:15:13,505 --> 00:15:15,505
looking to rebook your flight, right?

266
00:15:15,505 --> 00:15:20,195
So if you imagine you have
a ai chat bot or a agent.

267
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:25,270
Available within your flight provider
app, which will automatically understand

268
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:29,360
your situation, compares prices and
everything rules and everything.

269
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,580
And it comes up with your
new new flight booking.

270
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:32,850
All.

271
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,390
You just need to do an accept, click
on accept, and then you're good to go.

272
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,550
You are new boarding pass
will be ready and you're ready

273
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,630
to board your next flight.

274
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,890
So that's a kind of an, a good realistic
example that I can talk about other than

275
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,720
what we have implemented at Snowflake.

276
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,670
With the modern AA agents,
you don't need to do anything.

277
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,910
You don't need to talk to any
person, any human, so everything

278
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,500
will be taken care automatically.

279
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,500
So I think that's where like the,
a AI agent, short signing the agent

280
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,750
AI is becoming so popular especially
for these type of use cases.

281
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,510
Let's go to the next slide.

282
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:08,940
So this is where like I just wanted
to touch upon various industries

283
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:12,600
where they can start, where, how they
can scale and succeed with the ai.

284
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,330
For example, as I talk a little bit about,
like the telecom or the internet companie.

285
00:16:18,865 --> 00:16:23,815
They can predict predict so churn
even before customers leave, right?

286
00:16:24,355 --> 00:16:28,955
Let's say the usage is going down or, if
the customer is not using their service

287
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:34,155
pretty much any much pretty much, then
probably, like it can practically.

288
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:39,360
Send out personal retention offers
through their, to their emails based

289
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,710
on the behavior or something like that.

290
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,520
So that, that is one thing.

291
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:47,550
And also, if the, as I said, if the
network is not working as expected

292
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,400
let's say a customer has signed up for,
like a hundred megabits per second.

293
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:56,410
But they are end up receiving only 20
s. But they're not noticing anything.

294
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,180
Major difference.

295
00:16:58,525 --> 00:17:01,705
Like the, these systems can predict
and then they can fix everything

296
00:17:01,705 --> 00:17:04,895
back in the backend automatically,
even before customer notices it.

297
00:17:05,395 --> 00:17:09,705
And also in the SaaS side of the things
we know, like the SaaS is a very popular,

298
00:17:09,705 --> 00:17:13,185
like a lot of product, a lot of companies
are spliting up their SaaS products.

299
00:17:13,725 --> 00:17:15,135
The AI can help you.

300
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:18,035
Identify feature adoption gaps.

301
00:17:18,075 --> 00:17:23,235
And also, let's say O one SaaS
company have 10 different features,

302
00:17:23,235 --> 00:17:27,585
the customer is only using one
or two probably, like the AI can

303
00:17:27,585 --> 00:17:31,755
automatically send a personalized
tutorial based on the customer use

304
00:17:31,755 --> 00:17:33,525
case or the customer environment.

305
00:17:33,555 --> 00:17:36,285
And then they can explain like
how they can use other eight

306
00:17:36,285 --> 00:17:38,955
or nine features, which the
customer is not using as of today.

307
00:17:39,455 --> 00:17:43,785
And also it can help respond to customer
proactively even before they come and

308
00:17:43,785 --> 00:17:45,285
open a support case with us, right?

309
00:17:45,285 --> 00:17:46,275
Support ticket with us.

310
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:50,335
And when you take a look
at the manufacturing, the

311
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,045
predictive analytics kind of a.

312
00:17:52,925 --> 00:17:59,275
Use case for the manufacturing industry is
basically anticipating equipment failures.

313
00:17:59,685 --> 00:18:01,965
Scheduling, maintenance even before.

314
00:18:02,025 --> 00:18:07,605
And they go down IOT sensors by using
IOT sensors and like the systems will

315
00:18:07,605 --> 00:18:09,195
predict and then they'll send in alert.

316
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,660
To the technician, and the technician
will automatically take care of

317
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,070
the, of those, missions missionary
before, before they go down.

318
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:21,175
And also as we all know ai is
helping financial and all companies,

319
00:18:21,175 --> 00:18:24,075
maybe mostly this is applicable
for all industries, right?

320
00:18:24,075 --> 00:18:27,815
Where payment is payment processes
involved, so it can automatically

321
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:32,015
detect payment issues and issue
auto refund in case of any

322
00:18:32,015 --> 00:18:33,215
failures or something like that.

323
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,410
And even communicate before the
customers can complain, saying that,

324
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,240
Hey, your transaction is failed.

325
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,355
We have automatically refunded every
amount back to the original payment

326
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:43,315
method or something like that.

327
00:18:43,975 --> 00:18:46,975
So that's the power of predictive
analytics, and that's where the

328
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:50,735
companies can start scale and succeed
without, needing to put too much of

329
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:55,175
manual effort just by tapping on the
AI and including AI into their regular

330
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,995
workflows and adding human in the loop.

331
00:18:58,495 --> 00:18:58,915
All right.

332
00:18:59,115 --> 00:19:02,975
Let's so what are the, some of the ethical
challenges or what are the, some of the

333
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:07,725
challenges that, that anybody or everybody
can face during this whole journey?

334
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,900
Number one is and also I'll touch base
a little bit about how to navigate them.

335
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,080
Number one is like the data
is always residing in silos.

336
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:19,440
So that is the biggest challenge that
they all these enterprise companies

337
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,420
have, like they have their CRM systems,
they have their customer transaction

338
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,910
systems, they have their royal TP systems.

339
00:19:27,495 --> 00:19:31,395
Maybe they have their like data
warehouses, data lakes, so that

340
00:19:31,395 --> 00:19:32,625
the data is everywhere, right?

341
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:36,735
So we need to invest in, how to
overcome the challenge is simple, right?

342
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:37,360
We have to.

343
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,960
Invest in, in data integration
and a good data governance before

344
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,080
plugging in yay AI on top of the data.

345
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,180
So that's the number one challenge.

346
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,200
And and how to overcome that is
is having a good data governance

347
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,490
and data integration in place.

348
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,490
And the second one is by
us in training, right?

349
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:00,540
So if you train your model
only on some type of data.

350
00:20:00,955 --> 00:20:03,865
It'll always try to, bias
us towards that, right?

351
00:20:03,865 --> 00:20:07,285
So you have to ensure that your
training data is well diversified

352
00:20:07,855 --> 00:20:12,475
and also you need to audit data for
the training data for data quality.

353
00:20:12,955 --> 00:20:15,745
Are there any issues or is
the data, is the good data

354
00:20:15,745 --> 00:20:17,465
or does it have any bad data?

355
00:20:17,665 --> 00:20:20,985
Missing emails or missing missing,
like some other information,

356
00:20:20,985 --> 00:20:24,885
which is very key for the AI
model to predict and take action.

357
00:20:25,465 --> 00:20:29,815
And also how to test models for
fairness across, different segments

358
00:20:29,815 --> 00:20:32,935
of people, different segments of, like
geographies or something like that.

359
00:20:33,475 --> 00:20:35,935
So that's one thing that
we have to be very careful.

360
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,655
And the second one is and the third
one is like our personalization

361
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,305
is sometimes it causes.

362
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,205
Too much of a problem for customers.

363
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:47,715
We have to be always transparent
and we have to tell our customers

364
00:20:47,715 --> 00:20:52,005
that saying that, Hey, we are using
AI to provide you a better service.

365
00:20:52,005 --> 00:20:54,275
If you are not into it please opt out.

366
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:56,415
From that, something like that, right?

367
00:20:56,415 --> 00:20:59,475
So we have to provide better
controls to, to our customers.

368
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:06,545
And also adding humans in the loop for
any critical decisions is always best.

369
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:09,845
Even though AI is doing a lot
of heavy lifting, that shows

370
00:21:09,845 --> 00:21:11,495
some accountability on our side.

371
00:21:11,545 --> 00:21:14,175
Which is very important in this slide.

372
00:21:14,245 --> 00:21:17,304
So these are the five best
practices that, that I can, and

373
00:21:17,304 --> 00:21:18,270
that I can share with you all.

374
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,399
The number one is of course data is first.

375
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:26,379
I always put data at the first
because, like quality data foundation

376
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:31,689
even before building your EA models,
training your EA models or testing them.

377
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:36,639
So you have to always have your
data, quality of data available

378
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:38,409
in a commonplace and also.

379
00:21:38,909 --> 00:21:42,739
You need to integrate AI
into your existing workflows.

380
00:21:43,249 --> 00:21:46,259
You don't need to, create or
rebuild everything from the scratch.

381
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,099
Just identify areas where your
teams are putting a lot of manual

382
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:54,929
effort and see naturally v AI
can be a best fit in that area.

383
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:58,569
And then start including ai there, right?

384
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:04,539
So you just build a AI model or try to
plug in your s and then input your, data

385
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:09,109
into the LLM and it'll automatically,
start taking care of that heavy

386
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:10,579
process lifting or something like that.

387
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,779
And of course, you have to
the third best practice.

388
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:14,499
You have to always.

389
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:16,189
Add a human in the loop.

390
00:22:16,739 --> 00:22:20,129
As we know, AI tends to make
some mistakes, so it's always

391
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:24,330
good to have some human oversight
and feedback into the model.

392
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,500
The fourth one is, like
measure continuously.

393
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,470
In our previous example that
I have shown you, like csat.

394
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:36,110
So we have before and after, and also
we try to see like how the CSAT scores

395
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,650
before and after, how the resolution
times are looking, like, how the

396
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:43,575
retention rates are looking like,
so you have to track and iterate on

397
00:22:43,575 --> 00:22:44,784
the same thing every now and then.

398
00:22:45,284 --> 00:22:49,374
And the last point here is the,
transparency, as I talked about it

399
00:22:49,374 --> 00:22:53,405
in the earlier slide, you have to be
very transparent with the use of ai.

400
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:56,614
So you have to tell your customers
that you're using AI to improve

401
00:22:56,614 --> 00:22:58,024
their overall experience.

402
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:02,375
It, it definitely builds trust and you
have to provide them options, right?

403
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:05,705
If they don't want to use ai, they can
they should be able to opt out of that.

404
00:23:06,065 --> 00:23:07,745
So that's the fifth to best practice.

405
00:23:07,745 --> 00:23:12,215
These five best practices are a very
important, and we have used these five

406
00:23:12,215 --> 00:23:16,705
best practices in our day-to-day regular
work at Snowflake building the, especially

407
00:23:16,705 --> 00:23:18,145
the examples that I have talked about.

408
00:23:18,645 --> 00:23:20,145
So what is the path forward?

409
00:23:20,145 --> 00:23:22,685
So the path forward is
pretty simple, right?

410
00:23:22,685 --> 00:23:28,445
So these companies are, that the leading
tech companies are using ai for serving

411
00:23:28,445 --> 00:23:31,365
better providing best customer experience.

412
00:23:31,735 --> 00:23:36,145
Come up with like the features that
the customers are asking for, improving

413
00:23:36,145 --> 00:23:38,305
their overall products and services.

414
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:39,685
So those are the winners.

415
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:42,385
These winners aren't
replacing humans for sure.

416
00:23:42,435 --> 00:23:48,040
With the AI automation or A TKA are
using AA in regular day-to-day life.

417
00:23:48,605 --> 00:23:54,015
But instead they are enhancing the overall
experience by adding AI into the regular

418
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:58,565
workflows and having human connection
with with all these intelligent systems.

419
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:03,235
One, one small thing that I can suggest
definitely to everybody, whoever

420
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:07,655
is listening to this conversation
this talk you have to start small.

421
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:10,975
You don't need to build everything
from the scratch, as I said, see

422
00:24:11,025 --> 00:24:15,945
observe your existing workflows
and see where you can include ai.

423
00:24:16,395 --> 00:24:20,535
So that's where like you have to
measure your impact and, and also

424
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:26,195
see that if the scaling also works
from if AI can best serve that kind

425
00:24:26,195 --> 00:24:30,315
of a scale always keep the human in
the loop and feedback to the model.

426
00:24:30,855 --> 00:24:32,235
Thank you all so much for.

427
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,670
Like joining in if you have any questions,
feel free to reach out to me and you

428
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:42,650
can find me on LinkedIn by my name
Rajni K, and you can connect with me.

429
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,810
Thank you so very much, and you happy?

430
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,750
You have a great conference.

431
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,140
Thank you.

432
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:47,470
Bye-bye.
