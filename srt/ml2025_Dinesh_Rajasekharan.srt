1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,780
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,959
I'm Dineh Raja Sharan.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:12,220
I'm honored to be here at Con 42 to
talk about the future of cybersecurity.

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:19,990
As someone deeply involved in
both academia and industry,

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,715
I've seen firsthand how the
cybersecurity landscape is evolving.

6
00:00:26,064 --> 00:00:29,634
And how AI is not just a
tool, but a game changer.

7
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:35,665
Over the next 30 minutes, I will walk
you through the transformation from

8
00:00:36,205 --> 00:00:43,225
reactive to predictive cybersecurity,
focusing on how AI is enabling

9
00:00:43,615 --> 00:00:51,115
organizations to stay ahead of ever more
sophisticated cyber security threats.

10
00:00:52,225 --> 00:00:53,335
Let's dive in.

11
00:00:54,335 --> 00:00:58,055
To app appreciate the urgency
of this transformation.

12
00:00:58,055 --> 00:01:06,755
Consider this, the global cost of
cyber crime is expected to reach

13
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:11,165
10.5 trillion annually by 2025.

14
00:01:12,575 --> 00:01:17,105
That's up from $3 trillion
just a decade ago.

15
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:24,185
This explosion is driven by everything
from ransomware to phishing,

16
00:01:24,575 --> 00:01:27,605
data theft nation state attacks.

17
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:34,565
The good news is we have tools
today that can help us fight back.

18
00:01:36,155 --> 00:01:37,805
AI is one such tool.

19
00:01:39,455 --> 00:01:45,155
MIT's a AI two platform,
for example, detects.

20
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:53,120
85% of attacks and a
financial firm using AI saw a

21
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,580
60% drop in false positives.

22
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,280
These are in incremental improvements.

23
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,720
They are breakthroughs.

24
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:09,660
So why isn't traditional
security enough anymore?

25
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,650
First, it's reactive.

26
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,720
It only kicks in once
damage is already done.

27
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:26,200
Second, the sheer volume of data
in modern networks overwhelmed

28
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,360
static rule-based systems.

29
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:35,050
Third, traditional systems depend on
known attack vectors or signatures.

30
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,950
That means if an attacker
creates a new tactic.

31
00:02:39,475 --> 00:02:42,094
A zero day your defense is blank.

32
00:02:42,994 --> 00:02:48,904
This is like using a map from the past
to navigate a rapidly shifting landscape.

33
00:02:50,374 --> 00:02:54,844
AI allows us to move beyond
that limitation by learning from

34
00:02:54,844 --> 00:02:56,765
patterns, not just pass emails.

35
00:02:57,765 --> 00:03:03,284
AI changes the game by enabling real time.

36
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:06,135
Dynamic threat detection.

37
00:03:08,804 --> 00:03:11,954
It starts with comprehensive
data collection.

38
00:03:13,124 --> 00:03:17,535
Everything from firewall
logs to user behavior.

39
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:24,644
Then it pre-process the data cleaning
and structuring it from analysis.

40
00:03:26,475 --> 00:03:33,084
Next AI models, the large language
models dive into the data.

41
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:37,944
Identifying subtle patterns or
anomalies that humans might miss.

42
00:03:39,144 --> 00:03:44,094
Finally, the system provides
security teams with actionable

43
00:03:44,094 --> 00:03:51,774
insights, sometimes even triggered
automated containment protocols.

44
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:57,384
The result is faster detection,
better prioritization, and

45
00:03:57,444 --> 00:03:59,094
more efficient response.

46
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:01,684
And how do we go about this?

47
00:04:02,195 --> 00:04:07,954
So there are three foundational
techniques at play here, anomaly

48
00:04:07,954 --> 00:04:14,044
detection, pattern recognition,
and real-time threat intelligence.

49
00:04:16,445 --> 00:04:19,954
Anomaly detection uses historical data.

50
00:04:20,254 --> 00:04:24,754
To flag behaviors that
deviate from the norm.

51
00:04:27,094 --> 00:04:32,284
Pattern recognition identifies
complex combinations of events

52
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:34,444
that may signal a threat,

53
00:04:36,454 --> 00:04:41,659
and the real time threat
intelligence integrates internal

54
00:04:41,809 --> 00:04:48,739
data with global threat feeds
to assess risk asset intervals.

55
00:04:51,619 --> 00:04:53,359
And then they act together.

56
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:55,489
Together.

57
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:03,710
These techniques enable systems to evolve
and adapt just as quickly as attackers do.

58
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,369
And then let's.

59
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:10,969
Zoom into the three models, what we
discussed in the previous slides,

60
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:14,359
ly detection, pattern recognition,
real time threat intelligence.

61
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:18,474
Let's consider the example
of a supervised learning.

62
00:05:19,739 --> 00:05:23,760
Supervised learning uses
labeled data sets like previous.

63
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:28,409
Phishing attacks leveraging the
previous phish phishing attacks.

64
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:31,119
You can predict similar future attacks.

65
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,159
On the other hand, unsupervised
models are more exploratory.

66
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,319
They cluster data, they find outliers.

67
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:43,349
They're perfect for spotting
new kinds of threats.

68
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:49,809
Then there's deep learning which
shines in high volume, high complexity

69
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:51,519
environments like cloud infrastructure.

70
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:59,729
These models, especially the the
nns and CNNs of the world, are

71
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:04,859
able to process logs, sensor data,
user actions in a nuanced way,

72
00:06:04,859 --> 00:06:07,204
identifying threats no human code.

73
00:06:08,204 --> 00:06:12,284
Normally detection is
not a one time setup.

74
00:06:13,754 --> 00:06:17,714
First, it builds a baseline
of normal operations.

75
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:22,139
Who locks in when, what actions are taken.

76
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:28,109
Then in real time, it flags deviations.

77
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:33,839
For instance, if an employee
suddenly accesses an entire database

78
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:40,634
at 3:00 AM which is not a normal
pattern, the system notices.

79
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:44,924
More importantly, these AI systems evolve.

80
00:06:45,734 --> 00:06:50,114
They adapt their baseline to
reflect changes in normal behavior,

81
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:54,014
minimizing false positives over time.

82
00:06:54,434 --> 00:06:56,834
They get smash smarter, not just faster

83
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:58,184
click.

84
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:02,534
Let's look at three case
studies, for example.

85
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:09,509
Let's take a financial institute,
let's say a major bank integrated

86
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:16,169
AI for fraud detection, and saw not
only fewer false positives, but a 50%

87
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,709
increase in new fraud types detected.

88
00:07:21,514 --> 00:07:26,944
An e-commerce chain uses AI
to mitigate DDoS attacks,

89
00:07:26,974 --> 00:07:29,674
reducing impact by 91st, 95%.

90
00:07:31,429 --> 00:07:37,039
In healthcare, AI identified subtle
patient records, access patterns

91
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:38,629
that flagged insider threats.

92
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:45,919
These stories show how AI not only
helps protect, but also optimizes

93
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:51,709
how teams operate, freeing them
to focus on critical tasks.

94
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:58,839
Speaking of the pattern recognition
from the previous slides pattern

95
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:01,629
recognition is where AI truly shines.

96
00:08:02,109 --> 00:08:06,939
Attackers don't always follow the
same path, but they are often common

97
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:11,139
sequences like login anomalies
followed by privilege escalation.

98
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:15,644
AI mines historical logs to
find these attack fingerprints.

99
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:21,435
With the graph based analysis,
AI can even detect coordinated

100
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:24,374
campaigns across distributed systems.

101
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:29,654
This transforms how we investigate
threats from reactive foreign

102
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,089
six two proactive hunting,

103
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:35,044
the real time threat intelligence part.

104
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:40,509
AI also uses, I said, ears
across the network 24 7.

105
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:49,760
It correlates activities across endpoints
servers, cloud apps to spot risks early.

106
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,120
More importantly, it reacts in real time.

107
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,540
Some systems can isolate
infected machines.

108
00:08:57,305 --> 00:08:58,205
Automatically.

109
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:02,325
But by precious time and by
sharing threat intelligence across

110
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:07,155
organizations, we are creating a
more resilient digital ecosystem.

111
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:13,215
Studies show organizations
using threat intelligence reduce

112
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:15,105
breach cost by over 2 million.

113
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:18,095
However it's not all rosy.

114
00:09:20,045 --> 00:09:21,785
AI requires data.

115
00:09:23,225 --> 00:09:30,595
Specifically it requires clean label data
which often could become a bottleneck.

116
00:09:32,495 --> 00:09:36,215
Poor data leads to poor models,
and then there's a trust gap.

117
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:42,325
If a model flags a threat can be
explained why this black box nature

118
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:46,100
can be a compliance challenge also.

119
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,290
False positives still happen.

120
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:55,490
And then if frequent, and then if
frequent, they desensitize analysts,

121
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:02,130
a phenomenon known as alert fatigue,
lots of alerts lots of false positives.

122
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,950
Lastly, ethical concerns around
surveillance data usage must

123
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,630
be addressed thoughtfully.

124
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,500
The future though.

125
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:18,780
Looking ahead, if you see explainable
AI models that just justify their

126
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,670
decisions adversarial machine
learnings to defend against AI attacks,

127
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,200
federated learnings for privacy,
preserving analysis and analytics and

128
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,970
fully autonomous security systems.

129
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,340
So these.

130
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,020
Models, advances are not decades away.

131
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,620
They're already being tested in research
labs, in early stage developments.

132
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,320
Right now, there are several
startups that have been spinning

133
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,610
up with the same models.

134
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:46,945
So in summary,

135
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,480
AI isn't just the future of
cybersecurity, which is going to

136
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,530
happen like 10 10 years from now.

137
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,640
It is happening right now.

138
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,270
It's present.

139
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,410
But it's real value lies in collaboration
between humans and machines.

140
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,910
Between ethics and innovation.

141
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:11,710
If you build AI thoughtfully the result
will be stronger, smarter, and more

142
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:18,220
sustainable security systems that adapt
and scale without increasing without

143
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,370
increasing increasingly digital work.

144
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:22,650
Thank you.
