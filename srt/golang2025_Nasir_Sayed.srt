1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,930
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,370
Thank you for joining me today.

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,030
My name is Nas.

4
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,710
I'm thrilled to discuss how AI power
relationship data analysis, transforming

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,000
the fight against the financial fraud
and financial fraud is a global crisis

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,760
costing market over 3 trillion annually.

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,750
This isn't just a number, it's
a threat to economic stability,

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,120
investor confidence, and the trust
that underpin our financial system.

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,390
Traditional fraud detection matter while.

10
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,290
Often falls short when
it comes to identifying

11
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,300
sophisticated criminal networks.

12
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,049
Why?

13
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:36,819
Because they miss the hidden relationship
that enabled the complex fraud schema.

14
00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:41,920
Today I'll show you how AI driven
relationship analysis powered by

15
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:48,340
machine learning and graph based
algorithm is revolutionizing the space.

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,950
We'll explore how these technologies.

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,879
Enable financial institution to uncover
intricate connections and interview

18
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,160
before significant damage occur.

19
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,089
Let's start by understanding
the scale of the problem.

20
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:06,300
Fraudulent activities drain
over 3 trillion from the

21
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:07,919
global economy every year.

22
00:01:08,309 --> 00:01:12,389
To put that into perspective, the more
than the GDP of many countries combine.

23
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,030
This isn't just a problem
for bank or cooperation.

24
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,109
It affect consumers, small
businesses, and the entire economies.

25
00:01:19,895 --> 00:01:25,535
But here are the good news, the AI power
systems, and are making a real difference.

26
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,729
For example, these systems can
reduce false positive by 35%,

27
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,049
and it means less time wasted
investigating legitimate transaction

28
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,969
and more focus on the actual threat.

29
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,469
Even more impressive AI enhanced
fraud detections rates by 60%.

30
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:46,709
This mean we are now able to identify
sophisticated fraud network and high risk

31
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:49,225
individual with far greater accuracy.

32
00:01:49,725 --> 00:01:52,184
These aren't just incremental improvement.

33
00:01:52,725 --> 00:01:58,185
They are game changing advancement power
by machine learning model, like random

34
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:03,494
forest gradient boosting and deep neural
network of traditional detection methods.

35
00:02:04,095 --> 00:02:07,650
Now, let's talk about why the
traditional methods often fail First.

36
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,820
Traditional system focus on
the individual transactions.

37
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,350
In isolations, they look at
one transaction at a time, but

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,960
fraudster don't operate that way.

39
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,760
They use multiple accounts, entities,
and time period to hide their activities.

40
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,090
Traditional systems means
these patterns entirely.

41
00:02:26,364 --> 00:02:30,564
Second, these systems rely too heavily
on the historical fraud patterns.

42
00:02:31,075 --> 00:02:34,855
While history is important,
criminals are constantly innovating.

43
00:02:35,304 --> 00:02:38,994
By the time traditional system catch
up, the damage is already done.

44
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:43,254
Third, traditional system only
work with the structured data.

45
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:47,274
Things like transition, record
and account is, but fraudster

46
00:02:47,545 --> 00:02:49,524
leaves clues in unstructured data.

47
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:55,010
Social media, post news article, and
other external sources, traditional

48
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,749
system can't process this information.

49
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,209
Leaving critical
intelligence on the table.

50
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:04,549
These limitations create gap, that
criminal exploit, and that's where

51
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:05,945
the AI and machine learning comes in.

52
00:03:06,445 --> 00:03:09,204
This is where the AI
relationship analysis, Heinz,

53
00:03:09,234 --> 00:03:10,645
let me break it down for you.

54
00:03:11,185 --> 00:03:15,984
First, AI deliver an 80% reduction
in false positives compared to

55
00:03:15,984 --> 00:03:20,140
traditional rule-based system that
a massive improvement in efficiency.

56
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,740
Second AI uncovered complex
multi-layer fraud schema by

57
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,780
identifying non-obvious relationship.

58
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,030
For example, it can connect the dot
between seamlessly unrelated accounts

59
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:37,200
and entities using a graph based
machine learning models like Graph

60
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,820
Sage, graph Conversional network,
and the third AI seamlessly integrate

61
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,620
structure and unstructured data.

62
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,269
It can analyze the transition record.

63
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,880
Alongside social media, post news
article, and more using natural

64
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,840
language processing the techniques
like bird or transformer models.

65
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,230
Finally, AI enabled the
proactive risk identification.

66
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,910
Instead of waiting for fraud to
happen, AI identifies suspicious

67
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:07,710
pattern and emerging their threat
before financial losses occur.

68
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:12,779
In short, AI gives us a powerful
tool to stay ahead of fraudster.

69
00:04:13,245 --> 00:04:17,265
To achieve this AI system, integrate
data from multiple sources.

70
00:04:17,265 --> 00:04:18,435
Let's look at some example.

71
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:24,224
Public record, like government registries,
corporate filing, property records,

72
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,730
real complex ownership hierarchies,
and potential shell companies.

73
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:32,385
I. These are often used in fraud
schema to hide the true beneficiaries.

74
00:04:32,985 --> 00:04:35,685
Transition histories are
another critical source.

75
00:04:36,165 --> 00:04:40,305
By analyzing financial flow across
the multiple accounts and time

76
00:04:40,305 --> 00:04:45,015
period, AI can expose sophisticated
money movement pattern and coordinate

77
00:04:45,015 --> 00:04:50,925
fraudulent activities using time,
citizen analysis, anomaly detection

78
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:53,330
algorithm like isolation, forest, and.

79
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,740
Auto encoder.

80
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,705
The social connections are also key.

81
00:04:58,205 --> 00:05:01,625
Digital footprints across social
platform and professional network

82
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:08,045
can illuminate hidden relationship,
affiliation, and potential conclusions

83
00:05:08,105 --> 00:05:13,445
between signaling unrelated parties
using social network analysis.

84
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,190
We also call SNA.

85
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,720
Finally, the real time news and the
media monitoring provide critical context

86
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,420
for evaluating suspicious behavior
and emerging fraud trend Using NLP

87
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:31,210
and sentiment analysis by combining
these sources, AI paint a comprehensive

88
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,160
picture of fraud, potential fraud.

89
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,550
At the core of this technology, a
graph based machine learning model,

90
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,440
let me explain how they work.

91
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:45,110
First, the system ingest and
pre-process multi-source data.

92
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,510
This involve occurring, validating
and standardizing data from

93
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,860
various sources Using EDL
extract, transform load pipeline.

94
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,025
Next it perform entity resolution.

95
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:02,880
Unifying deduplicating identify using
fuzzy matching algorithm clustering

96
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,090
techniques like DB scan or kmi.

97
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:11,010
For example, it might recognize that
John Smith or J Smith are the same

98
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:15,530
person I. Then it mapped the relationship
generating a comprehensive network

99
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,180
graph that despite how entities are
connected, using the graph database

100
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,910
like Neo 4G or Amazon Neptune.

101
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,350
Finally, it applies algorithm
to detect and melos pattern.

102
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:33,070
For example, it might flag a network
of account that are transferring

103
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:37,930
money in a statically come in
probably way using community detection

104
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,120
algorithm like, label propagation.

105
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,160
This end-to-end process allow us to
identify fraud with unprecedented.

106
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,640
I could see one of the most
powerful feature of AI relationship

107
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,210
analysis is this ability to
detect hidden relationship.

108
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,770
Let's look at some example.

109
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,690
First, alias detection.

110
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,950
Frauds are often operate
under multiple identities.

111
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,260
AI can identify these aliases
by analyzing linguistic pattern,

112
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:13,210
behavioral fingerprints, and contextual
relationship using an LP models like

113
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,145
world to work vertical org glowy.

114
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,870
For example, it might notice that
two accounts using similar language

115
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,210
are having overlapping IP addresses.

116
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,890
Second layer ownership.

117
00:07:23,975 --> 00:07:28,205
Fraudster often use nested shell
companies and complex copyright

118
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:30,185
hierarchy to hide their control.

119
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:35,225
AI can penetrate the structure to
expose the ultimate beneficial owners

120
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:41,885
using graph traversal algorithm like
breath first, search depth first search.

121
00:07:41,915 --> 00:07:42,995
Indirect connections.

122
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:46,655
Fraud often use intermediate
issue to hide the relationship.

123
00:07:47,405 --> 00:07:51,020
AI can uncover these hidden
connections by mapping share assets.

124
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,040
Common associate and other indirect
links using links prediction algorithm.

125
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,200
Finally, a temporal pattern.

126
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:04,750
AI can detect suspicious timing,
correlation across transaction, using

127
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:11,020
time series analysis and statistical
model like A-R-I-M-A of profit.

128
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,775
These capabilities make it.

129
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,760
Incredibly difficult for fraud to hide.

130
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,740
Let's look at some real world result.

131
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,350
AI and relationship analysis achieves
95% detection rate compared to

132
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,210
just 40% with traditional system.

133
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,210
That's more than double the effectiveness.

134
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,460
It also reduces false
positive from 60% to just 25%.

135
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,070
This means fewer unnecessary
investigation and more focus on actual

136
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,800
threat in terms of processing time.

137
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,290
AI solution can process suspicious
transition in just 15 hours compared

138
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,130
to 72 hours with conventional methods.

139
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,910
This enabled a faster
responses to potential credit.

140
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:58,745
And when it comes to complex fraud,
schema AI detect 85% of cases versus

141
00:08:58,745 --> 00:09:00,425
only 30% with tradition system.

142
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:02,665
This number speaks for themselves.

143
00:09:03,115 --> 00:09:04,975
AI is a game changing in fraud detection.

144
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:09,415
I. To successfully implement AI
relationship analysis, there are several

145
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:13,795
best practice to follow for establish
a robust data governance framework.

146
00:09:14,215 --> 00:09:18,265
This means having a comprehensive policies
for secure data acquisition, ethical

147
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:23,395
usage, second integrated AI system
seamlessly with existing technology.

148
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:29,425
This might involve deploying the advanced
graph database like Neo 4G Tiger Graph.

149
00:09:29,925 --> 00:09:33,590
The an analytics platform that
communicate flawlessly with

150
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,300
your current infrastructure.

151
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:40,040
The third deploying phase start
with a high impact business area.

152
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:45,050
To validate ROI refine the process
before rolling out organization-wide.

153
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,800
Finally, create a dynamic
learning ecosystem.

154
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:54,665
This means implementing structure feedback
loops with fraud analyst to continuously

155
00:09:54,665 --> 00:09:59,645
enhance model accuracy and adapt the
emerging fraud pattern using reinforcement

156
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:02,525
learning and online learning techniques.

157
00:10:03,215 --> 00:10:06,845
By following this best practice,
you can maximize the effectiveness

158
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:08,525
of AI in your organization.

159
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:13,085
Financial, regulatory Now mandate
transparent AI decision making process.

160
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:14,795
This means generate.

161
00:10:15,295 --> 00:10:19,345
This means system must generate
comprehensive audit trial and clear

162
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:24,655
justification when flagging suspicious
relationship pattern using explainable

163
00:10:24,685 --> 00:10:32,935
AI technique like SHAP, sharply
Adaptive Explanation or LIME, local

164
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,935
interpretable model agnostic explanation.

165
00:10:36,115 --> 00:10:38,095
Privacy compliance is also essential.

166
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,130
The data acquisition and
processing must strictly adapt to

167
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,190
G-T-P-R-C-C-P-A and other financial.

168
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:51,230
A November organization must
implement rigorous concept mechanism

169
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:55,700
and practice data minimization
throughout analysis workflow.

170
00:10:56,255 --> 00:11:00,065
Continuous testing and third party
validation of AI model is also

171
00:11:00,065 --> 00:11:04,385
essential for regulatory compliance,
regular independent audit insurer.

172
00:11:04,385 --> 00:11:08,315
I will call them fairness,
statistical accuracy, and freedom

173
00:11:08,315 --> 00:11:09,785
from discriminatory outcome.

174
00:11:10,565 --> 00:11:13,505
Finally, across border
consideration are important.

175
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:19,855
International financial investigation
of complex jurisdiction requirements

176
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:24,745
organization must establish robust
framework for compliant data sharing

177
00:11:24,775 --> 00:11:29,145
across regulatory boundaries with
varying legal standard, the future

178
00:11:29,145 --> 00:11:30,825
of AI in financial compliance.

179
00:11:30,975 --> 00:11:34,065
Looking ahead, the future of
AI in financial compliancies,

180
00:11:34,575 --> 00:11:36,015
incredibly exciting.

181
00:11:36,585 --> 00:11:38,895
First, we'll see real
time fraud detection.

182
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:44,595
Instead of investigating fraud after
it happened, system will identify

183
00:11:44,925 --> 00:11:49,395
as it happened using streaming data
processing framework like Apache Kafka.

184
00:11:49,395 --> 00:11:53,145
Apache Flink Prevention will
replace the investigation.

185
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:57,455
Second, the cross industry collaboration
will become more, more common.

186
00:11:57,965 --> 00:12:02,555
Finance institution will Moore and
patent using federated learning

187
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:07,475
technique, creating a collective defense
that strengthen all participants.

188
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:13,035
That quantum computing will take
patent detection to UDE by, by

189
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:19,065
enabling analysis of vastly large geo
dataset, quantum computing will require

190
00:12:19,395 --> 00:12:21,285
patent that are currently invisible.

191
00:12:21,945 --> 00:12:25,095
Finally, predictive risk
model will anticipate new

192
00:12:25,095 --> 00:12:26,745
fraud type before the emerge.

193
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:31,995
Use in generative adverse serial
network and simulation based

194
00:12:31,995 --> 00:12:34,420
on approach says this mean.

195
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,160
Adaptation will out face
the criminal innovation.

196
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:42,360
In short, AI will continue
to revolutionize the fight

197
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,620
against financial fraud.

198
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,750
To wrap up AI power, relationship
data analysis is transforming the

199
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,400
fight against financial fraud.

200
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:55,460
By uncovering hidden connections,
reducing false positive and enabling

201
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,515
proactive is identification.

202
00:12:58,335 --> 00:13:01,850
It come a powerful solution
to a global problem.

203
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:04,655
The numbers speak for themself.

204
00:13:05,255 --> 00:13:10,415
AI is more than doubling detection
rates, reducing the positive,

205
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,645
enabling faster response time.

206
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:20,975
But beyond the number, AI is giving us
a tool to stay ahead of fraud starts

207
00:13:20,975 --> 00:13:24,035
in an increasingly complex world.

208
00:13:24,725 --> 00:13:25,895
Thank you for your time.

209
00:13:25,955 --> 00:13:29,105
I look forward to your questions.

210
00:13:29,345 --> 00:13:29,795
Thank you.
