00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,110
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,970
My name is Neha.

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:09,000
Today I will be discussing a comprehensive
framework for integrating artificial

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,950
intelligence into in-licensing
and e permitting support systems.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,900
This presentation examines how
advanced natural language processing

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,820
and machine learning techniques
can create intelligent assistance.

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,170
That argument.

8
00:00:25,485 --> 00:00:31,425
Human support agents rather than
replace them by automating routine

9
00:00:31,425 --> 00:00:37,995
tasks such as information gathering,
document verification, and case routing,

10
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:44,745
AI significantly streamlines the
licensing process while maintaining high

11
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:47,625
standards of accuracy and compliance.

12
00:00:48,495 --> 00:00:55,905
Early implementation results demonstrate
substantial, improves improvements in

13
00:00:55,995 --> 00:01:01,875
case resolution times staff productivity,
and overall user satisfaction.

14
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:07,665
Before diving into the AI solution,
let us first set the stage by

15
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:13,060
looking at the current landscape
of digital licensing services and

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,340
why a transformation is needed.

17
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,600
Digital government initiatives
have laid the groundwork for AI by

18
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,030
modernizing licensing processes.

19
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:32,370
Many governments now have dedicated
digital transformation offices and digital

20
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,580
first policies for regulatory services.

21
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:42,720
According to OECD data, 51% of
member countries have established.

22
00:01:42,975 --> 00:01:51,884
Central digital transformation offices and
roughly 68% have specific digital first

23
00:01:51,884 --> 00:01:54,075
strategies for licensing and permitting.

24
00:01:54,765 --> 00:01:59,384
However, the maturity of e
licensing still varies greatly.

25
00:02:00,075 --> 00:02:08,445
Leading nations boost around 72 person
digital integration of services while

26
00:02:08,535 --> 00:02:11,625
other continues to rely on hybrid.

27
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:13,995
Paper and digital systems.

28
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:19,215
These disparities lead to
inconsistent user experiences.

29
00:02:19,575 --> 00:02:24,645
Crucially, countries with fuel
integrated digital licensing strategies

30
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:28,665
see much higher citizen satisfaction.

31
00:02:28,755 --> 00:02:36,855
About 43% higher than average compared
to those, who do patchwork systems.

32
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:42,330
This underlines the value of
complete digital modernization

33
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,980
in government services.

34
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,020
In summary, there is a broad
recognition that embracing

35
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:54,060
technology can improve licensing
performance and user satisfaction.

36
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:01,680
Yet, despite this progress, many
operational challenges persist in

37
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,560
current systems, and this is where.

38
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,310
AI can make a meaningful difference.

39
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,010
Let us examine those challenges.

40
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:17,150
Next, despite digital progress,
today's e licensing systems face

41
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,490
significant operational hurdles.

42
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,130
Many processes remain manual.

43
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,405
In fact, how staff spend how to.

44
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:33,215
70% of their time on tedious document
verification and compliance checks.

45
00:03:33,785 --> 00:03:37,145
Cross jurisdiction workflow
are especially slow.

46
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:43,595
International license application
takes about 15 to 20 days longer to

47
00:03:43,595 --> 00:03:46,595
process on average than domestic ones.

48
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,440
And even within US state to
state verifications, for example,

49
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:56,660
transferring A CPA license add
around 12 to 15 days to the timeline.

50
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:05,630
As a result, about 82% of licensing
authorities report difficul

51
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,239
maintaining consistent services levels
during peak application periods.

52
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:15,850
Backlogs are common, especially
in high mobility professions.

53
00:04:16,194 --> 00:04:19,735
Where applicants move
across states frequently.

54
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:26,814
Furthermore, current systems struggle to
adapt quickly when regulation changes.

55
00:04:27,265 --> 00:04:32,184
Implementing a new compliance
requirements can take several months.

56
00:04:32,784 --> 00:04:36,914
These challenges, labor intensive
processes, jurisdictional complexity

57
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:42,349
and slow adaptability underscore
the need for a smarter approach.

58
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:43,580
This is where.

59
00:04:44,194 --> 00:04:49,774
AI comes in promising to
elevate many of these issues.

60
00:04:50,104 --> 00:04:54,184
Through intelligent automation
and decision support,

61
00:04:54,684 --> 00:04:58,734
artificial intelligence is
introducing a paradigm shift in

62
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:01,224
how licensing cases are handled.

63
00:05:01,974 --> 00:05:06,984
Early implementation of AI
assisted in-licensing systems have

64
00:05:07,044 --> 00:05:09,684
demonstrated dramatic improvements.

65
00:05:10,404 --> 00:05:17,334
Across key metrics, studies report
a 76% reduction in processing time

66
00:05:17,604 --> 00:05:24,204
and a 89% increase in accuracy
in application handling, along

67
00:05:24,294 --> 00:05:26,874
with a 92% drop in compliance.

68
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:31,694
Errors meaning process become much
faster and far less error prone.

69
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:36,569
AI is especially valuable
in complex scenarios.

70
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:41,969
For example, in multi-jurisdictional
license verifications where rules

71
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:49,259
differ by region AI solutions
have shown roughly 83% better

72
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:54,599
performance compared to traditional
methods, machine learning models.

73
00:05:55,109 --> 00:06:03,059
Can even predict application outcomes with
around 91% accuracy, enabling agencies

74
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:10,739
to resolve potential issues proactively
and allocate resources more effectively.

75
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:16,129
It is worth emphasizing that
these AI tools are designed to

76
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:19,939
argument, not replace human experts.

77
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:21,679
The AI handles.

78
00:06:22,085 --> 00:06:28,744
Routine tasks and provides data-driven
insights while human officers continue

79
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:34,445
to oversee the process and make
judgment calls on exceptional cases.

80
00:06:35,254 --> 00:06:41,585
The success indicator so far, make
a strong case that AI can address

81
00:06:41,585 --> 00:06:44,284
the challenges we identified.

82
00:06:44,885 --> 00:06:51,064
Next, let's discuss what is required
to implement such AI capabilities.

83
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:55,864
Starting with a technical architecture
that underpins the system.

84
00:06:56,364 --> 00:07:01,794
Implementing AI in-licensing
requires a robust architecture

85
00:07:02,034 --> 00:07:06,835
that blends into current government
IT systems, and remains scalable.

86
00:07:07,585 --> 00:07:12,984
Our solutions use a modern
microservices based architecture

87
00:07:13,674 --> 00:07:16,224
infused with AI components.

88
00:07:16,915 --> 00:07:21,325
Research shows this approach can
boost performance significantly.

89
00:07:22,105 --> 00:07:29,215
AI optimized services handled complex
licensing workflows 78% faster

90
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,255
than traditional system designs.

91
00:07:32,005 --> 00:07:36,534
Machine learning helps manage
the service network efficiently.

92
00:07:37,284 --> 00:07:40,495
AI driven routing and load balancing.

93
00:07:40,495 --> 00:07:40,885
Cut.

94
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:48,265
Interservice communication delays by
63%, and predictive scaling automatically

95
00:07:48,265 --> 00:07:51,775
adds capacity during peak demand.

96
00:07:52,435 --> 00:07:55,405
The architecture has three layers.

97
00:07:55,905 --> 00:08:00,909
The inter, if it is, sorry,
intelligent data acquisition

98
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:05,530
for automated data gathering and
validation, cognitive processing,

99
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,899
middleware for real time decision.

100
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:14,604
Support and smart workflow routing,
adaptive service delivery for

101
00:08:14,604 --> 00:08:17,064
dynamic resource allocation.

102
00:08:17,544 --> 00:08:22,945
This layer design allows the system
to quickly adapt to different

103
00:08:22,945 --> 00:08:28,140
tasks and volumes while remaining
compatibility with legacy systems.

104
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:34,409
In short, this technical foundation
enables AI driven intelligence

105
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,720
throughout the licensing process.

106
00:08:37,245 --> 00:08:42,044
Leading us to how data is
processed within the system.

107
00:08:42,544 --> 00:08:49,625
The AI system uses a multi-stage data
processing pipeline to analyze each

108
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:53,194
application rapidly and thoroughly.

109
00:08:54,155 --> 00:09:01,505
It performs an initial AI screening
to classify submission and extract

110
00:09:01,714 --> 00:09:04,594
key information achieving up to 98.

111
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,560
Percent accuracy.

112
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:13,389
It then applies cognitive validation with
deeper machine learning checks, which

113
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:19,689
raise accuracy to roughly 92%, sorry, 96%.

114
00:09:19,749 --> 00:09:26,349
And finally, a contextual validation
using advanced transformation transformer

115
00:09:26,354 --> 00:09:29,244
based models compared to application.

116
00:09:30,084 --> 00:09:37,584
Against relevant regulations bringing
accuracy to approximately 98%.

117
00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:43,094
These three automated checks
occur within seconds, flagging

118
00:09:43,094 --> 00:09:48,885
errors or compliance issues early,
and allowing valid applications

119
00:09:48,944 --> 00:09:51,224
to move forward without delay.

120
00:09:52,064 --> 00:09:52,665
Moreover.

121
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:59,250
The pipeline adapts to different document
formats and jurisdiction specific rules.

122
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:05,520
By learning from each case, this
intelligent framework dramatically

123
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:12,180
cuts down manual work, and it continues
to improve itself over time as

124
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,569
more data is processed in essence.

125
00:10:15,884 --> 00:10:21,374
The system handles licensing data
swiftly and with high precision,

126
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:27,034
ensuring accuracy and compliance from
the start with processing streamlined.

127
00:10:27,034 --> 00:10:32,464
And the next consideration is
how we safeguard the system

128
00:10:32,494 --> 00:10:34,474
security and integrity.

129
00:10:34,974 --> 00:10:41,574
Security is a key and a critical
pillar of this AI driven system.

130
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:49,994
The platform employs intelligent adaptive
defenses that evolve with emerging threats

131
00:10:50,144 --> 00:10:52,844
while safeguarding data and privacy.

132
00:10:53,344 --> 00:10:59,074
There are three key components, AI
enhanced authentication using behavior

133
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:05,750
biometrics for continuous user
verification, which achieves 96% accuracy

134
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,110
in detecting unauthorized access attempt.

135
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:16,160
Cognitive authorization, an AI that
dynamically adjusts user permissions

136
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:23,780
based on context and risk preemptively
blocking 89% of potential access

137
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:30,339
violations and intelligent data protection
machine learning algorithms that

138
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:36,969
monitor data usage and flag anomalies,
identifying suspicious access events.

139
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:41,079
47 times faster than traditional methods.

140
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:47,439
Together these measures greatly
strengthen the system's defense.

141
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:53,889
They catch threats in real time,
automatically adapt to new attack

142
00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:59,949
patterns, and even adjust security
controls as regulation change.

143
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:05,924
In essence, that AI makes the licensing
process not only more efficient.

144
00:12:06,654 --> 00:12:11,214
But also highly secure
and compliant by design.

145
00:12:11,694 --> 00:12:17,034
Now, having covered the architecture
and security, let's examine the core

146
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:24,299
functionalities and how we benefit
that this AI enabled system delivers.

147
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:32,214
Integrating AI into the licensing platform
introduces several key capabilities.

148
00:12:32,714 --> 00:12:34,754
Intelligent information processing.

149
00:12:35,594 --> 00:12:42,104
Automated data extraction and validation
significantly improves accuracy by about

150
00:12:42,104 --> 00:12:50,834
64% and speeding up to processing time,
for example, turning a task that took

151
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:55,304
45 minutes into one, done in 12 minutes.

152
00:12:55,724 --> 00:12:59,529
Workflow optimization, AI
driven workflow management.

153
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:04,649
Dynamically prioritizes en routes
cases, cutting average case

154
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:14,489
resolution time by 53%, and improving
decision consistency by 76%.

155
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:22,349
Advance the analytics Daphne Framework
and AI analytics engine analyzes

156
00:13:22,349 --> 00:13:24,689
patents and provides decision support.

157
00:13:25,544 --> 00:13:30,224
It has improved the accuracy of
decisions in complex cases by

158
00:13:30,224 --> 00:13:36,644
59% and can predict potential
compliance issues or workload surges.

159
00:13:36,944 --> 00:13:41,384
So they are, and they can
be addressed proactively.

160
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:47,404
Overall, these capabilities allow the
licensing process to run faster, more

161
00:13:47,404 --> 00:13:49,684
accurately and more consistently.

162
00:13:50,404 --> 00:13:51,694
The AI handles.

163
00:13:51,979 --> 00:13:54,679
Routine work and flag issues.

164
00:13:54,979 --> 00:14:00,859
While human officials can focus
on complex cases, having seen what

165
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:07,159
the system can do, let us consider
how to implement it effectively

166
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:10,179
to realize this AI solution.

167
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:14,519
We follow a four part
implementation strategy.

168
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:21,169
Infrastructure preparation and governance,
establishing the necessary infrastructure

169
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:28,189
and AI governance early, which results
in 63% better compliance, alignment

170
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:35,119
system integration, connecting the
AI platform seamlessly with legacy

171
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:42,649
systems, 71% faster interstate license
verification processing observed.

172
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:49,649
Capability development, comprehensive
