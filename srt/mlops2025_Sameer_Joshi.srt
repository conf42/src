00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,220
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,540
My name is Samis Joshi.

3
00:00:02,599 --> 00:00:05,570
I'm working with Cognizant as a
senior, a technical architect on Duck

4
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,490
Creek Technology Cloud platforms.

5
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:12,150
I'll Today we're walking you through
how robust ML ops practices are

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,280
transforming insurance operations.

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,609
And then over the next few slides,
I'll show you how AI driven

8
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:21,119
strategies are delivering up to
65% efficiency gains and reducing.

9
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:25,069
Processing times by as much as
99% across insurance functions.

10
00:00:25,069 --> 00:00:25,879
So let's dive in.

11
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:28,179
So here's our agenda for today.

12
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:31,989
First, we'll look at the broader
AI transformation in insurance.

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,680
Then we'll dive into ML Lops
architecture and examine specific

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,520
technical deep dives like modeling
computer vision and telematics.

15
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:45,199
Next we'll touch on compliance
and biases detect, followed by an

16
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:47,879
implementation roadmap and ROI analysis.

17
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,529
Finally, I'll summarize the key takeaways
and share the actionable next steps.

18
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,479
Let's start.

19
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:58,089
Insurance as an industry has
come a long way in AI adoption.

20
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:02,349
Before ML ops only about 18% of the
carriers are experimenting with AI.

21
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:05,869
Today, thanks to ML ops that
option has grown to 54%.

22
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:12,600
The results are tangible 65% higher
operational efficiency, and a 60%

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,399
improvement in underwriting accuracy.

24
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:16,829
This isn't just about automation guys.

25
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,019
It's about enabling cons, consistent
data driven decisions that scale.

26
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,919
Let's rewind and see why
transformation was needed.

27
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:30,079
Traditionally, policy applications
involve paperwork and manual data entry.

28
00:01:30,529 --> 00:01:34,829
Underwriting was often subjective and
policy issuance took three to four days.

29
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:38,279
Claims assessments could stretch
for weeks, and risk evaluation

30
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:40,049
was limited to annual reviews.

31
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,139
The net effect was higher cost.

32
00:01:43,809 --> 00:01:48,099
Long cycle times and inconsistent
customer experiences.

33
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:51,329
So now here comes into picture the ML ops.

34
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,869
So ML lops brings order and automation.

35
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,559
So here we are talking about continuous
integration and deployment pipelines

36
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:01,769
that cut the deployment cycles by 78%.

37
00:02:02,169 --> 00:02:04,779
Feature store architectures,
architectures that reduce

38
00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:07,024
feature engineering time by 67%.

39
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:11,979
And model registries that ensure
traceability and compliance.

40
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:16,899
This integrated architecture allows
insurers to respond quickly to

41
00:02:16,899 --> 00:02:19,059
market and regulatory changes.

42
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:20,339
That's interesting.

43
00:02:20,564 --> 00:02:23,924
Proceeding with transformative
transf transformative results

44
00:02:24,314 --> 00:02:25,484
on the policy issuance.

45
00:02:25,994 --> 00:02:27,944
So consider policy issuance.

46
00:02:28,184 --> 00:02:30,674
So traditionally it
took three to four days.

47
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:33,374
With ML lops, it's down to just 15%.

48
00:02:33,374 --> 00:02:33,899
Now with mops.

49
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:41,739
So that 99% re time reduction in time
while maintaining a 93.6% accuracy rate.

50
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:46,509
The key lies in the automated risk
assessments, document processing

51
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:51,189
and continuous monitoring that
ensures model remains accurate

52
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:53,079
even as risk profiles evolve.

53
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:56,819
Proceeding to next step comes
the catastrophe modeling.

54
00:02:57,359 --> 00:02:59,009
That's a very important point in here.

55
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:03,839
Catastrophe modeling is critical for
insurers but traditional approaches relied

56
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:08,879
on static data and quarterly updates with
machine learning operations model in just

57
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,014
real time weather data, satellite image
imagery, and even assemble approaches that

58
00:03:14,014 --> 00:03:16,474
mix physics and machine learning together.

59
00:03:16,684 --> 00:03:17,169
The outcome.

60
00:03:18,034 --> 00:03:23,194
It's a 31% boost in the flood
prediction accuracy, nearly 30%

61
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:28,294
better cyclonic forecast, and a 43%
improvement in claims readiness.

62
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:30,724
And that's a very good number.

63
00:03:31,224 --> 00:03:33,279
If you pro, if you look
into the computer vision.

64
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:37,654
In case of the property and casualty
insurance let's start on this point.

65
00:03:37,814 --> 00:03:41,594
In this case, if you see computer
vision has ref re redefined the property

66
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:46,834
inspections with drones running Edge,
deploy on the running on the edge deployed

67
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:51,974
models, insurers can capture pre-pro,
insurers can capture pre-process and

68
00:03:51,974 --> 00:03:53,864
assess property damage in real time.

69
00:03:54,354 --> 00:03:59,034
Accuracy has reached 89% and
inspections that once took days

70
00:03:59,034 --> 00:04:00,094
are now completed in minute.

71
00:04:00,964 --> 00:04:03,784
Importantly, champion
challenger frameworks.

72
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:09,044
Ensure models are continuously valued and
improved proceeding with the telematics.

73
00:04:10,004 --> 00:04:14,265
This basically brings the real time
example where I'll tell you how

74
00:04:14,564 --> 00:04:18,224
telematics is helping in assessing
the real time driver risk assessment.

75
00:04:18,504 --> 00:04:21,534
Driver behavior is another area
that is being shaped by ai.

76
00:04:21,624 --> 00:04:24,684
Telematics use uses OBD two.

77
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:28,779
Which is on onboard diagnostic
devices and smartphones to

78
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,999
capture over 300 driving features.

79
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,999
Kafka based streaming pipelines
processes, terabytes of data

80
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:37,309
daily and containerized inference.

81
00:04:37,369 --> 00:04:41,989
Inference engines adjust seamlessly to
traffic loads compared to traditional

82
00:04:41,989 --> 00:04:43,849
demographic based risk assessments.

83
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:48,379
Predictive power has improved by
83%, and that's again, a very good

84
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:52,749
number now proceeding to regulatory
compliance and bias distinction.

85
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,289
So no AI transformation is
complete without addressing

86
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:57,759
fairness and compliance.

87
00:04:58,119 --> 00:05:02,209
So automated adversarial
testing detects nearly 80% of

88
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:04,009
potential bias before deployment.

89
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:07,889
Model validation pipelines,
automate documentation and

90
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:12,674
regulate regulatory reporting
cutting compliance cycles by 67%.

91
00:05:13,294 --> 00:05:18,884
So techniques like lime, LIME,
local interpretable model, agnostic

92
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:23,514
explanations, and SHAP shapely
edit additive explanations.

93
00:05:23,514 --> 00:05:28,504
These enhance explainability, which
is crucial in market regulated like

94
00:05:28,504 --> 00:05:30,594
insurance now proceeding with the.

95
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:34,479
How the architecture looks like
the integrated data architecture.

96
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:39,099
So to achieve accurate models,
insurers must unify data.

97
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:44,319
So here eight to 12 data sources come
together, like customer data, property

98
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:49,749
details, IOTs, telematics, imports,
credit scores, even alternative signals

99
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,514
like satellite imaginary imagery.

100
00:05:51,694 --> 00:05:53,434
So by integrating these sources.

101
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,949
Through automated feature
engineering predicting accuracy

102
00:05:57,949 --> 00:05:59,989
improves by more than 36%.

103
00:06:00,489 --> 00:06:05,069
Now, if we come to the key components
for the MLF implementation, ML LOPS

104
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:09,119
implementation there are four components
that make it make this possible.

105
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:10,949
Automated deployment
pipelines using GitHubs.

106
00:06:11,924 --> 00:06:17,624
Monitoring frameworks for real time
drift detection experimentation platforms

107
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:23,384
for AB testing and centralized feature
stores with versioning Together, these

108
00:06:23,474 --> 00:06:29,224
form a mature ML ops ecosystem that
balances speed, accuracy and compliance.

109
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:33,684
So now if we look into the
implementation roadmap, so

110
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,009
transformation doesn't happen overnight.

111
00:06:35,844 --> 00:06:41,304
So phase one is building the foundation
registries, versioning, and pipelines

112
00:06:41,904 --> 00:06:45,774
over three to four months it, it
takes to build all these things.

113
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:47,664
Now, phase two, operationalize.

114
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:51,549
Workflows, like automated
training and monitoring.

115
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:54,679
The typically, this typically
takes two to three months.

116
00:06:54,769 --> 00:07:00,319
And then phase three, that adds
optimization, automated retraining,

117
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:04,519
AB testing, and compliance
automation over three to four months.

118
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,089
So within a, within less than a
year, insurancers, insurers can go

119
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:13,329
from POC to production, and that's a
very good timeframe to achieve this.

120
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:16,739
So next we'll proceed
with the ROI analysis.

121
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,989
The results speak for
themselves, which on my slide.

122
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:23,839
Before ML ops model deployment,
claims processing and process and

123
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,169
policy issuance times are much
higher after adoption carriers.

124
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:31,129
Certain big carriers saw improvements
within nine to 12 months, and

125
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:33,159
these aren't just marginal gains.

126
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:36,544
They are game changers that
reduce operational costs and

127
00:07:36,544 --> 00:07:38,344
scale as new models come online.

128
00:07:38,844 --> 00:07:41,454
Proceeding to the key takeaways.

129
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:47,794
First is ML lops is driving a 300%
growth in AI adoption across insurance.

130
00:07:48,004 --> 00:07:52,414
Secondly, end-to-end automation
insurers accuracy above 93%

131
00:07:52,444 --> 00:07:54,034
while enabling rapid iter.

132
00:07:54,534 --> 00:08:00,174
Third, compliance and fairness
frameworks cut regulatory cycles by 67%.

133
00:08:00,574 --> 00:08:06,534
For your next steps assess your current ML
maturity and pri prioritize high value use

134
00:08:06,534 --> 00:08:11,329
cases, establish foundational components
like registries and feature tools,

135
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:13,979
and integrate compliance from day one.

136
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,929
Doing this as it was mentioned,
we can go from POC to production.

137
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:21,089
In within nine to 12 months.

138
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:22,929
Thank you guys.

139
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:24,209
Thank you for your time and attention.

140
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:28,559
I hope this session gave you a big picture
and technical depth on how ML Ops is

141
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,109
revolutionizing the insurance operations.

142
00:08:31,609 --> 00:08:33,589
Thank you and good day.
