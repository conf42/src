1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,390
My name is Harpreet Singh.

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:05,740
I'm going to talk about how do we
leverage the sales data analytics to

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,690
optimize the pharmaceutical drug launches.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:14,520
So I'm going to talk about some of the
typical challenges we have, when we

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,890
are talking about the drug launches,
how data analytics, work as a solution.

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,520
I'll also cover some of the aspects
of the predictive modeling AI

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,640
machine learning, in the scenarios.

8
00:00:27,185 --> 00:00:30,535
also we'll look at, some of
the, cases where the real time

9
00:00:30,535 --> 00:00:32,375
analysis help with the insights.

10
00:00:32,655 --> 00:00:36,575
Also, we will, we'll cover some of
the KPIs and then we talk about some

11
00:00:36,585 --> 00:00:41,295
of the advanced data architecture in
the industry and then some of the best

12
00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:43,855
practices, for these analytics deployment.

13
00:00:44,355 --> 00:00:47,125
So I think to start with, I think
the very first thing about when

14
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:51,675
you think about any drug launch
in the pharmaceutical industry.

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,980
It takes a lot of time and efforts
and resources if you think about

16
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,610
an average one, Development
of one product costs around 2.

17
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:05,630
6 billion dollars It provides you an
exclusivity of few years So then I think

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,500
the market timing and entry is critical
also as a first product It gives you

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,155
a competitive advantage in the in that
therapeutic area Also, I think the the

20
00:01:16,165 --> 00:01:20,865
initial months are very critical because
that's where 60 percent of the revenue is

21
00:01:20,905 --> 00:01:26,055
generated in like just first six months of
the launch so For the companies it is very

22
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:31,525
important then they optimize these launch
strategies To make sure that they are in

23
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:36,025
their highest revenue potential right and
helping a lot of patients at the same time

24
00:01:36,525 --> 00:01:43,115
so now Let's talk about, we understand the
challenges, but how do the data analytics,

25
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:44,945
from the sales side help with that?

26
00:01:45,835 --> 00:01:51,905
So I think the sales data analytics,
in the launch phase, for the product

27
00:01:52,225 --> 00:01:56,285
provide real time data insights,
which help you to optimize in

28
00:01:56,285 --> 00:01:57,985
every step of the cycle, right?

29
00:01:58,335 --> 00:02:01,035
So for example, if you
think about a forecasting.

30
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:05,635
different predictive models can be
used, to forecast of the product

31
00:02:05,685 --> 00:02:09,705
revenue and which are typically
in a very good accuracy range.

32
00:02:10,055 --> 00:02:13,565
also, there's a lot of element
of the real time data processing.

33
00:02:13,565 --> 00:02:15,945
There's a lot of rich
data on the pharma side.

34
00:02:16,305 --> 00:02:21,345
So processing of those data also
provide you a quick insights

35
00:02:21,345 --> 00:02:23,305
to react on the market events.

36
00:02:23,765 --> 00:02:28,820
Also based on this, We are able
to penetrate a market potential

37
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,570
or market share at a higher rate.

38
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,160
So all these different elements of
the analytics and data addresses these

39
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,310
challenges and then we'll talk some of
those in details in the next few slides.

40
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,970
I think the very first thing is about when
you think about the advanced analytics,

41
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,440
predictive modeling, AI, machine
learning, we do have a lot of data, right?

42
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,035
So if you think about the data
from the prescriber, from the

43
00:02:53,045 --> 00:02:57,725
doctors, patient level data, medical
claims, hospitals buying product.

44
00:02:58,135 --> 00:03:00,185
So there's a lot of rich data.

45
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,275
That's where a lot of, AI
algorithm can be used to provide

46
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:04,255
those insights and insights.

47
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,200
Some of the capabilities of the
predictive models can be related

48
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,830
to how do you target the physician.

49
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,810
So if you want to look at which doctors
you need to target for the pre launch

50
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,750
and the post launch phase, a lot of
AI driven segmentation we created,

51
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,630
then you can look at who are the high
potential prescriber and then you

52
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,620
can optimize the engagement for that.

53
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,400
Also from the pricing point of
view, there are different models

54
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,670
available where you can use.

55
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:36,065
multiple inputs and have Provide what
should be the right price for the

56
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:39,745
product and providing the competitive
advantage at the same time I think

57
00:03:39,745 --> 00:03:44,245
when you think about these models, they
have evolved a lot in last few years

58
00:03:44,245 --> 00:03:48,175
right now We are talking about 80 to
90 percent accuracy in these models.

59
00:03:48,205 --> 00:03:52,175
So we are getting a really good accuracy
from these predictive models when you

60
00:03:52,185 --> 00:03:56,885
think about the insights Also, a lot of
these models can also be used for the

61
00:03:56,885 --> 00:04:01,125
territory deployment and that provide
an efficiency of at least 30 percent

62
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:05,135
efficiency with the, with deploying
those territories for the launches.

63
00:04:05,635 --> 00:04:10,935
I think the other important thing, when we
think about a lot of data, you think about

64
00:04:10,945 --> 00:04:15,985
there's like millions of data points,
also because that launch is so crucial.

65
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,890
There's limited time frame when we
have to react a company has to react

66
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,650
on the market events So real time data
processing definitely helps a lot.

67
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,690
And then if you think about the real
time processing Reduce the market

68
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,029
response time from 15 days to like few
days and like maybe three days, right?

69
00:04:34,549 --> 00:04:38,479
So these Definitely improved
accuracy in forecasting.

70
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:42,624
you can you are able to predict things
more accurately also at the same time You

71
00:04:43,144 --> 00:04:47,004
Any kind of adjustment you need to make,
in, in, in that launch strategy, you can

72
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:50,704
do it like as less as like in 72 hours.

73
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:53,674
so these are very critical things
and timely things during the

74
00:04:53,674 --> 00:04:54,894
first six months of the launch.

75
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:59,774
And then, before the launch and
after the launch, there are a lot

76
00:04:59,774 --> 00:05:05,404
of KPIs which play a critical role,
in understanding if the product is

77
00:05:05,464 --> 00:05:07,394
on a right path for the success.

78
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:12,409
these KPIs are derived by different
data analytics, pieces around it.

79
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:15,979
So when you think about, I think we
have some of the examples here, think

80
00:05:15,989 --> 00:05:17,179
about the conversion rate, right?

81
00:05:17,179 --> 00:05:20,119
So when you launch a product,
how many doctors have actually

82
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,229
prescribing this product?

83
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:26,839
So definitely, I think the, if you can
achieve 15, 20 percent conversion in

84
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:31,539
first three months, that kind of correlate
with 85 percent of the probability of you

85
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,569
would achieve, your first year target.

86
00:05:34,049 --> 00:05:39,549
Also, when you think about the patients,
the persistency on adherence to the

87
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:40,869
product is also important, right?

88
00:05:40,869 --> 00:05:46,529
So how long a patient is staying on
therapy for 3 months, 6 months, right?

89
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:52,079
So if you have a good persistency, good
adherency, you have a very high chances

90
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,529
of product is getting a successful launch.

91
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:59,299
So these early conversion rate, provides
a momentum for the launch, for the

92
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:05,159
commercial success and higher persistency
definitely build that brand loyalty

93
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:06,389
and market leadership at the end.

94
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:10,439
so these benchmarks, these KPIs, you
can track them on a weekly basis.

95
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:14,259
You can track them on the monthly
basis based on the objective

96
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:15,659
of their brand launches.

97
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:18,779
So now I think, There are
different pieces, right?

98
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:24,999
I think we talk about the AI, predictive
models and then the real time, generation.

99
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:31,790
also we talk about this plethora of data
across doctors, hospitals, patients.

100
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,269
The other important thing with
that much of data, you also need, a

101
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:38,059
very high processing speed, right?

102
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:40,179
So we are talking about
like petabytes of data.

103
00:06:40,664 --> 00:06:46,294
So now a lot of pharma companies
are spending A lot of money on their

104
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:51,384
infrastructure around the data warehouse
right on the aws cloud based system.

105
00:06:51,384 --> 00:06:53,654
So to process this kind of data, right?

106
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:58,054
So there's definitely a lot of cloud based
warehouse that can handle like millions

107
00:06:58,114 --> 00:07:03,894
of transaction per second Once you set up
these infrastructure on top of that We are

108
00:07:03,894 --> 00:07:09,479
implementing like python or r kind of a
language which Provides you these models

109
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:14,139
and these high accuracy Also hundreds
of dashboards are built on top of that.

110
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:17,739
So you have your data structure then
your python and r and then you have a

111
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:20,199
lot of dash dashboard tableau dashboard.

112
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:25,449
You think about Power bi dashboard that
also helps you to see how What's happening

113
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:29,829
in the market and then these dashboard
create like I would say hundreds of report

114
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:34,610
for different customers based on their
need like sales marketing finance etc I

115
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,240
think with all of these things in place.

116
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,620
and helping a successful launch.

117
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,420
I think there are some best
practices right across the

118
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,010
industry, which we have seen.

119
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:48,810
I think the first thing we just touched
about, the data quality has to be there.

120
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,620
It's garbage in, garbage out, right?

121
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,850
If your data quality is not
good, you will not have that

122
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,760
highest, higher accuracy, right?

123
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,030
And there, there are definitely a
dedicated team in, in, in the pharma

124
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,800
companies, which are working on the
lot of validation process, right?

125
00:08:04,315 --> 00:08:08,215
To make sure that the millions of
records what we are having has a higher

126
00:08:08,265 --> 00:08:14,225
accuracy and it's a good quality data
they have a lot of different Framework

127
00:08:14,235 --> 00:08:19,805
on data governance, which provides you
like continuous audit of this humongous

128
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:23,615
data Also the other thing when you
think about the best practices, there

129
00:08:23,615 --> 00:08:29,695
are a lot of different models Which
requires resources and An effort to

130
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:35,085
implement that so one of the Approaches
maybe apply a pilot product, right?

131
00:08:35,095 --> 00:08:39,055
So for example, you want to have a
prediction model which predict how many

132
00:08:39,055 --> 00:08:42,795
new patient will come into the market
So instead of doing like a full fledged

133
00:08:42,835 --> 00:08:46,395
national level implementation, which
would require millions of dollar You

134
00:08:46,395 --> 00:08:48,459
can start with a small territory, right?

135
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:53,372
You start with one territory and
test that model and Get that feedback

136
00:08:53,372 --> 00:08:56,582
from the sales and marketing and
do you see a value out of it?

137
00:08:57,007 --> 00:09:01,507
So This phase approach definitely help
you so you start with territory and then

138
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:05,857
based on that You can apply that fine
tune the model and apply throughout the

139
00:09:05,857 --> 00:09:11,437
nation so these Scalable implementation,
definitely give you a lot of confidence

140
00:09:11,777 --> 00:09:17,367
and at the same time these models are
built based on feedback, during the pilot

141
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:23,607
phase The kpis we talk about so they're
like at least 50 kpis pre launch and

142
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:27,862
post launch With a higher accuracy that
also provide a critical insights right

143
00:09:27,872 --> 00:09:31,662
throughout that and then if you have to
do a course correction You can do it do

144
00:09:31,662 --> 00:09:37,062
that during that launch phase Also, I
think that the model updates and then is

145
00:09:37,102 --> 00:09:40,732
are there any biases and the consistent
performance tracking is also a critical

146
00:09:40,842 --> 00:09:46,072
piece I think with that maybe I think
just A conclude all of these thing is

147
00:09:46,082 --> 00:09:51,422
that the integration of the sales state
analytics and in pharmaceutical industry

148
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:56,082
has proven to be transformative right
and providing a substantial improvement

149
00:09:56,482 --> 00:10:00,642
in terms of the market penetration
the resource optimization a successful

150
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:08,162
launch so so definitely is solving a very
complex challenge, right and then We talk

151
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:14,427
about the development cost and then how
compressing the launch window and then the

152
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:18,417
traditional methods like previous methods
were, I think it's helping we, it's

153
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,377
helping us to overcome those challenges.

154
00:10:20,397 --> 00:10:24,507
And then advanced predictive modeling,
AI, machine learning, these are,

155
00:10:24,787 --> 00:10:30,207
even accelerating these insights
for the company and making sure

156
00:10:30,227 --> 00:10:32,477
that the launches are successful.

157
00:10:33,337 --> 00:10:36,527
So results, and I think
the approaches are clear.

158
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:40,147
The pharmaceutical companies are
implementing these data driven

159
00:10:40,147 --> 00:10:44,697
strategies on an average of 30 23
percent improvement on launch trajectory.

160
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:49,397
And then they see a higher market
