1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,290
Good day everyone.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,890
My name is a Sal from
End Living Technologies.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,260
Today I will be discussing how we
can optimize Oracle and skill server

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,719
databases in cloud, focusing on
practical frameworks for achieving high

5
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,705
performance on AWS and Azure Clouds.

6
00:00:19,205 --> 00:00:23,165
First, the critical role of
database performance As robotics

7
00:00:23,195 --> 00:00:27,784
automation and data driven system
continues to expand database

8
00:00:27,784 --> 00:00:29,314
performance become mission critical.

9
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:33,709
Every milliseconds of the latency
can influence real time decision.

10
00:00:34,209 --> 00:00:38,919
I will cover why optimization of
database on Modern Cloud platform is not

11
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:41,439
just a beneficial, but it's essential

12
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:44,009
foundational optimization techniques.

13
00:00:44,339 --> 00:00:48,509
Before we drive into cloud native
tools, it is important to understand

14
00:00:48,569 --> 00:00:54,049
core database optimization principles
like a scale plan management, a WR

15
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:57,079
analysis, query, store insights.

16
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:02,679
These help maintain stability,
diagnose bottlenecks, and track

17
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:03,969
very performance over time.

18
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:12,190
Next, cloud Native Performance Tools,
both AWS and Azure provide powerful tools.

19
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:17,920
Like a WR. Performance Insights
helps you to visualize and diagnose

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,210
database load in real time.

21
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,660
While Azures intelligent tuning uses
machine learning to automatically

22
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,430
adjust and improve the performance.

23
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,590
Next query optimization query execution.

24
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,560
Identifying and resolving problematic
queries is central to optimization.

25
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:39,419
Using tools like a WR and Performance
Insights, you can pinpoint slow queries.

26
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:44,509
Review the execution plan and
apply targeted improvements like

27
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,759
indexing or query rewriting.

28
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:51,289
Next now we'll see into resource
utilization and workload throughputs.

29
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:55,880
Efficient resource management
ensures maximum throughput memory.

30
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:58,695
Ivo and CPU must.

31
00:01:59,195 --> 00:02:03,214
Appropriately while connection
pooling helps reduce the latency

32
00:02:03,274 --> 00:02:05,464
in high concurrency environments.

33
00:02:05,964 --> 00:02:09,234
Exhibition plan stability
ensures predictable performance.

34
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:15,084
Using SQL Plan Management in Oracle and
a query stored plan, forcing in a scale

35
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:20,545
server, you can capture and enforce the
optimal plans to prevent the regressions.

36
00:02:21,045 --> 00:02:25,204
Partitioning strategics for sales
partitioning improves performance

37
00:02:25,204 --> 00:02:30,325
and simplified management with a
range hash or list partitioning.

38
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:34,734
It helps to target specific
data sets efficiently and

39
00:02:34,734 --> 00:02:36,325
reduce the maintenance windows,

40
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:38,774
workload, governance, and resource manage.

41
00:02:39,274 --> 00:02:45,274
Governance ensures critical workloads
get the resources and they need Oracle

42
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:49,834
Resource Manager and Escal Server
Resource Governance allows fine tuned

43
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:52,984
control over CPU and Memory and Sessions

44
00:02:53,484 --> 00:02:54,609
cross-platform benchmark.

45
00:02:55,109 --> 00:03:00,269
Comparing AWS and Azure performance
through standardized benchmarks helps to

46
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:05,669
determine optimal workload par placement
testing with KPS, like query response

47
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:09,959
time and TPS gives clarity on trade offs.

48
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:14,279
Now we'll go to the
strengths and of AWS and.

49
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:19,084
AWS offers deep visibility and
flexibility tools like Performance

50
00:03:19,084 --> 00:03:21,574
Insights and Aurora Serverless.

51
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:26,154
Meanwhile, Azure provides machine
learning driven through hyperscale

52
00:03:26,154 --> 00:03:28,559
database that supports massive workloads.

53
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:31,029
Cost management in cloud databases.

54
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,709
Cost to optimization is just as vital.

55
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:35,594
A right sizing instance.

56
00:03:35,714 --> 00:03:40,244
Committing to reserve capacity,
optimizing storage, and setting up

57
00:03:40,244 --> 00:03:45,044
monitoring alerts are key strategies
for sustainable cloud spending.

58
00:03:45,544 --> 00:03:48,034
Now we'll go through the emerging trends.

59
00:03:48,784 --> 00:03:52,249
We are seeing automat automation
evolve with machine learning

60
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:54,184
driven through serverless database.

61
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:59,814
Edge computing and greener infrastructure
that reduce the carbon footprint.

62
00:04:00,314 --> 00:04:03,524
Now we'll see the roadmap,
how the roadmap will be.

63
00:04:04,304 --> 00:04:08,474
Start by assessing your current
performance improvements, quick

64
00:04:08,474 --> 00:04:12,224
wins, established governance,
and plan strategic improvements.

65
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:14,744
Remember, optimization
is a continuous process.

66
00:04:15,224 --> 00:04:16,844
We cannot stop on a day.

67
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:21,634
It should continue as data
grows or infrastructure grows.

68
00:04:22,134 --> 00:04:24,084
Finally, the takeaways.

69
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:28,279
Integrated traditional techniques
with cloud tools optimized across

70
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:33,284
all dimensions and prepare for the
future with adapt to architectures.

71
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:34,804
Thank you Finally.

72
00:04:35,554 --> 00:04:36,574
Thank you for your time.

73
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:40,294
I hope this session give you the
accountable insights into optimizing

74
00:04:40,294 --> 00:04:43,834
your database performance, cost
effective, and scalability in the cloud.

75
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:45,064
Thank you.
