00:01:58,654 --> 00:02:02,384
However, this rapid approach
is not without its challenges.

32
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:06,699
On average, organizations
face a staggering 43 cloud

33
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:08,399
security incidents every month.

34
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,509
These range from data breaches
to misconfigurations and

35
00:02:12,529 --> 00:02:14,019
malicious insider activities.

36
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:18,009
These incidents highlight a harsh reality.

37
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,649
Many organizations are not fully
equipped to handle the security

38
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:24,859
complexities that come with the cloud.

39
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:30,984
Traditional approaches to cyber
security are often inadequate, leaving

40
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:35,994
gaps in protection and exposing
sensitive data to potential threats.

41
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:41,184
This underscores the urgent need for
a comprehensive security framework

42
00:02:41,224 --> 00:02:45,434
that doesn't just react to the
threats, but actively prevents them.

00:03:58,359 --> 00:03:59,909
unmatched speed and accuracy.

61
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,849
The third pillar is the
quantifiable security enhancement.

62
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:07,679
Our approach has been proven
to deliver remarkable results.

63
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:13,599
Around 94 percent fewer successful
breaches and 76 percent reduction

64
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,859
in the detection time compared to
the traditional security systems.

65
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,689
These metrics highlight the effectiveness
of our framework in mitigating risks.

00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:25,749
Finally, an enterprise grade
reliability ensuring 99.

67
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:30,899
29s of availability, while maintaining
the comprehensive security.

68
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:36,039
This means organizations can rely
on their cloud environments to

69
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:40,669
remain operational and secure even
during their high demand periods.

70
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:45,569
Together, these components form a robust
and innovative solution to the most

71
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:47,759
pressing challenges in cloud security.

72
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:50,439
setting up a new standard
for the industry.

73
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:55,859
Now let's discuss the network security
architecture within the frame, framework.

74
00:04:56,359 --> 00:05:01,579
At its core, at its core, is a zero trust
implementation that employs military

75
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:03,379
grade network micro segmentation.

76
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:09,649
Each subnet operates with its,
dedicated security context, enforces

77
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:12,119
strict and granular access policies.

78
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:16,739
This approach has shown to reduce the
lateral movement attacks by an impressive

79
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:22,199
85 percent, especially even if an
attacker gains access to one part of the

80
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,139
network, they are effectively isolated,
prevents preventing the further spread.

81
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,249
Another critical component is our
AI ML traffic analysis system.

82
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:39,674
This state of, state of the art
technology process processes over 1

83
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:41,534
million network events per second.

84
00:05:42,154 --> 00:05:47,314
By leveraging advanced deep
learning models, it achieves a 99.

85
00:05:47,364 --> 00:05:51,034
2 percent accuracy in detecting
sophisticated attack patterns,

86
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,664
including zero date threats.

87
00:05:54,174 --> 00:06:00,124
What's more, it reduces false positive
by 92 percent ensuring the security

88
00:06:00,124 --> 00:06:05,044
teams can focus on real issues
without, unnecessary distractions.

89
00:06:05,884 --> 00:06:08,094
Lastly, the tripwire
system is a game changer.

90
00:06:08,594 --> 00:06:13,289
It reduces attacker persistent
times from an industry average

91
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,264
of 72 days to less than 24 hours.

92
00:06:17,234 --> 00:06:23,104
Distributed sensor networks and parallel
processing allows for the neutralization

93
00:06:23,104 --> 00:06:24,964
of threats within 50 milliseconds.

94
00:06:25,924 --> 00:06:32,314
This rapid response capability ensures
minimal disruption to the operations

95
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:33,904
while protecting the sensitive data.

96
00:06:34,404 --> 00:06:39,684
Authentication is one of the most critical
aspects of cloud security, and this

97
00:06:39,684 --> 00:06:41,464
framework takes it to the next level.

98
00:06:42,344 --> 00:06:46,494
It starts with an advanced
user classification system

99
00:06:46,504 --> 00:06:48,294
that processes and analyzes 1.

100
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:53,354
2 million authentication requests
daily with lightning fast response

101
00:06:53,354 --> 00:06:54,764
times of under 200 milliseconds.

102
00:06:55,614 --> 00:06:56,164
It blocks 99.

103
00:06:56,164 --> 00:06:59,674
7 percent of unauthorized access attempts.

104
00:07:00,274 --> 00:07:04,024
The key here is AI powered
behavioral analysis.

105
00:07:04,474 --> 00:07:08,834
which detects the patterns and anomalies
that traditionally systems often miss.

106
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:11,624
Token security is another vital feature.

107
00:07:12,304 --> 00:07:17,444
the framework validates 500, 000
secure tokens per minute using

108
00:07:17,444 --> 00:07:18,624
a military grid encryption.

109
00:07:19,194 --> 00:07:25,474
The multi layer approach to
certificate validation ensures nearly

110
00:07:25,474 --> 00:07:29,084
perfect security, achieving 98, 99.

111
00:07:29,184 --> 00:07:33,154
98 percent of effectiveness
against sophisticated spoofing

112
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,684
and manipulation attempts.

113
00:07:35,554 --> 00:07:40,474
Finally, the Kilt switch mechanism
provides an industry leading

114
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:42,314
security lockdown capability.

115
00:07:42,844 --> 00:07:47,004
In less than 100 milliseconds, it
terminates the compromised sessions across

116
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:48,724
all the connected systems and devices.

117
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:54,219
This feature has proven highly
effective and reducing unauthorized

118
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:58,554
access incidents by 94 percent
compared to the traditional methods.

119
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:04,074
Together, these components form a
robust authentication framework that

120
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:06,174
safeguards sensitive systems and data.

121
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:11,714
Authorization ensures that users
and systems only access the

122
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,334
resources they are allowed to.

123
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:18,184
And this framework takes a highly
dynamic and detailed approach.

124
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:22,174
First, we'll implement the
principle of least privilege.

125
00:08:22,804 --> 00:08:23,314
Processing 1.

126
00:08:23,314 --> 00:08:29,224
5 million authorization decisions
daily across 25 distinct access levels.

127
00:08:30,014 --> 00:08:36,004
This ensures that users only have
access to what they need for their role,

128
00:08:36,034 --> 00:08:38,174
reducing the risk of privileged abuse.

129
00:08:38,674 --> 00:08:42,994
Dynamic access control is another
key feature with 10, 000 policy

130
00:08:42,994 --> 00:08:44,814
updates occurring every hour.

131
00:08:45,244 --> 00:08:50,264
These updates are automated and
detect excess privileges, revoking

132
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:51,834
them immediately if necessary.

133
00:08:52,654 --> 00:08:58,034
This dynamic approach ensures that
access policies remain accurate and

134
00:08:58,034 --> 00:09:00,274
reflect the current operational context.

135
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:04,314
Continuous auditing plays a vital
role as well, analyzing over

136
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:06,214
50 million daily access events.

137
00:09:07,084 --> 00:09:10,824
By doing so, the system
reduces privileged, privileged

138
00:09:10,824 --> 00:09:11,944
related audit findings.

139
00:09:12,824 --> 00:09:14,814
by an impressive 90, 91 percent.

140
00:09:15,314 --> 00:09:18,604
This not only ensures the
compliance, but also makes the

141
00:09:18,604 --> 00:09:20,244
auditing process more efficient.

142
00:09:20,744 --> 00:09:26,344
Finally, real time risk assessment
evaluates 200 distinct risk factors

143
00:09:26,404 --> 00:09:29,004
to dynamically adjust privileges.

144
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:34,719
This proactive capability ensures
that potential risks are mitigated

145
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:37,739
before they can cause any harm.

146
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:42,049
Maintaining the security of
sensitive systems and data.

147
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:48,029
APIs are the backbone of our modern
applications, enabling seamless

148
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:49,539
communication between systems.

149
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,859
However, they are also a
significant target for attackers.

150
00:09:54,674 --> 00:09:58,774
Our framework addresses this
with a robust API security layer.

151
00:09:59,494 --> 00:10:02,694
At the core of this layer is
the request validation system,

152
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:05,954
which processes an astonishing 2.

153
00:10:05,954 --> 00:10:07,864
3 billion requests every day.

154
00:10:08,364 --> 00:10:12,514
that's over 2, 000, sorry,
26, 000 requests per second.

155
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:14,404
All validated with a 99.

156
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:17,624
97 percent exploit prevention rate.

157
00:10:18,124 --> 00:10:22,954
Despite this rigorous security, the
system remains ultra fast, response

158
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:24,689
times of under 50 milliseconds.

159
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:30,619
Anomaly detection is another essential
feature, leveraging advanced machine

160
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:35,789
learning algorithms and a data set of
over 500 billion historical API requests.

161
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:40,909
The system analyzes 235 unique
parameters per transaction.

162
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:46,179
This allows it to identify and block
potential threats with precision.

163
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:52,414
Threat intelligence Integration
rounds out the API security layer.

164
00:10:53,194 --> 00:11:00,634
By synthesizing real time data from
27 global intelligence sources, the

165
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:05,514
framework updates its protection
mechanism every 30 seconds.

166
00:11:06,424 --> 00:11:11,414
This ensures that it remains resilient
against the latest cyber threats and

167
00:11:11,414 --> 00:11:17,334
attack vectors, providing organizations
with an unparalleled level of security.

168
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:23,504
Threat detection is, a cornerstone for
any security framework, and this system

169
00:11:23,534 --> 00:11:25,354
is designed to excel in this area.

170
00:11:26,324 --> 00:11:30,424
It leverages advanced,
analytics to process 2.

171
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:32,934
