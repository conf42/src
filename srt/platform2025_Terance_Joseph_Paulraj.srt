1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,489
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,989 --> 00:00:03,520
Thank you for joining today.

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:09,989
My name is Terrance Stan, Joseph Ra
and I specialize in enterprise data

4
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:15,330
architecture, cloud data engineering,
and AI driven business intelligence.

5
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:17,694
Let me start with a simple question.

6
00:00:18,194 --> 00:00:22,409
Have you ever had to wake up in
the middle of the night because

7
00:00:22,409 --> 00:00:23,819
your data pipeline broke?

8
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:29,749
The dashboard for the morning meeting is
empty and everyone is waiting for answers.

9
00:00:30,249 --> 00:00:34,119
This is not right for many
engineers and managers.

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,640
This happens again and again.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,705
Instead of building new solutions,
we spend our time firefighting

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,160
and fixing broken system.

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,480
But what if you could change that?

14
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:54,519
What if our system could detect problems
before they spread, fix themselves and

15
00:00:54,519 --> 00:00:56,679
free us to focus on real innovation.

16
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:02,669
Today, I want to share how we can
move from what I call pipeline

17
00:01:02,669 --> 00:01:04,800
health to platform paradise.

18
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:11,095
I will walk you through the problem we
face in the hidden cost and the solution.

19
00:01:11,785 --> 00:01:16,015
Which is building a self-healing,
metadata driven data platform.

20
00:01:16,915 --> 00:01:17,695
Let's begin.

21
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:20,415
Many of us have faced
the maintenance crisis.

22
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:26,855
Your small change in an upstream system
like adding a single new field can

23
00:01:26,855 --> 00:01:30,545
break dozen sub pipelines, reports fail.

24
00:01:31,355 --> 00:01:35,555
Dashboard stand blank and the
end entire team scrambles.

25
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:40,885
Instead of delivering new
features, teams waste days or weeks

26
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,795
finding out what broke and why.

27
00:01:44,295 --> 00:01:48,849
Simple integration, which should
take a few days, stretch into weeks.

28
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:52,335
Over time, technical depth piles up.

29
00:01:53,145 --> 00:01:56,384
The more we build, the more
fragile system becomes.

30
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:59,554
The crisis doesn't just hurt developers.

31
00:02:00,184 --> 00:02:02,164
It hurts business too.

32
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,514
Decision makers lost.

33
00:02:04,514 --> 00:02:08,834
Trusting dashboards, delays,
means missed opportunities.

34
00:02:09,614 --> 00:02:10,755
What should be the strength?

35
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:14,289
Data driven insights, but
it becomes a weakness.

36
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:18,749
The problem here was in
clumsy coding or bad luck.

37
00:02:19,249 --> 00:02:20,149
The problem is steep.

38
00:02:20,649 --> 00:02:22,509
The architecture itself was fragile.

39
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:27,399
Unless we rethink how
systems are redesigned, these

40
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:29,199
midnight calls will never yet.

41
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:33,989
Traditional data systems usefully
follow your simple ETL model.

42
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:37,339
The extract, transform, and load.

43
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:44,089
On paper, it looks fine, but in
practice this model hides big cost.

44
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:46,299
The first fit and cost is speed.

45
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:51,809
Engineering velocity drops
because even small changes need

46
00:02:51,809 --> 00:02:53,879
coordination across many teams.

47
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:58,544
Adding a customer field may procure
updates in multiple systems.

48
00:02:59,044 --> 00:03:01,174
The second cost is operations.

49
00:03:01,674 --> 00:03:07,284
As the number of pipelines grows
linearly, the complexity goes much faster.

50
00:03:07,784 --> 00:03:11,114
Each new pipeline makes the
system harder to maintain.

51
00:03:11,614 --> 00:03:13,684
Teams spend more time keeping.

52
00:03:13,684 --> 00:03:16,624
World systems are live
than building new ones.

53
00:03:17,124 --> 00:03:20,879
The third cost is quality
problems often so up late.

54
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:26,299
After the data has been already used
for important business and decisions,

55
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,979
fixing them feels like detective work
and the business losses confidence.

56
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,369
These are in just technical headaches.

57
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:40,269
These are business problems and
reliable data means lower decisions,

58
00:03:40,749 --> 00:03:43,569
missed chances and reduced competition.

59
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:49,214
What seems like a small system issue
can hold back the entire organizations.

60
00:03:49,714 --> 00:03:51,384
There are two more hidden costs.

61
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,574
We often overlook the
fastest developer experience.

62
00:03:56,074 --> 00:03:58,979
New team members face
a steep learning curve.

63
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:03,349
The system is too complex for
one person to fully understand.

64
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:08,499
Senior engineers become bottlenecks
because they are the only one

65
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,779
who knows the fragile details.

66
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:14,309
This makes self-service almost impossible.

67
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:16,159
The second is scalability.

68
00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:22,329
As the data grows, traditional
system hit performance was scaling

69
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,619
doesn't make things smooth.

70
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:25,809
But it makes them heavier.

71
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:29,189
Often, the only way forward is expensive.

72
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:33,629
Rates are messy patches
that increase complexity.

73
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:36,679
Further, these issues
are like a hidden tax.

74
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:39,649
Every new feature cost more to bill.

75
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:41,689
Every change takes longer.

76
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:47,364
Over time, this tax slows down
the business and frustrated teams.

77
00:04:47,864 --> 00:04:51,074
So pipeline here is in just
about late net failures.

78
00:04:51,644 --> 00:04:58,064
It is also about slower projects,
rising costs, and unhappy engineers.

79
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:03,874
If you want a better feature, we
need a smarter design that scales

80
00:05:03,964 --> 00:05:06,249
without thought creating more pain.

81
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:11,034
In the turning point comes when
we look at metadata in a new way.

82
00:05:11,534 --> 00:05:16,634
Met data is simply data about
data, things like schema, rules,

83
00:05:16,634 --> 00:05:18,374
lineage and configurations.

84
00:05:18,874 --> 00:05:21,874
In most systems, metadata is scattered.

85
00:05:22,374 --> 00:05:23,514
Some is in document.

86
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:26,409
Some in code and some in people's heads.

87
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,289
Because of this, the system cannot
react automatically to changes.

88
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:37,139
But what if you treat metadata as
the foundation of the platform?

89
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:40,849
Think of it like the nervous
system in the human body.

90
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:46,739
Your body reacts automatically when you
touch something hot, it does not wait

91
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:49,829
for your brain to write new infections.

92
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:54,494
In the same way, your metadata
driven system can detect changes,

93
00:05:54,824 --> 00:05:59,924
adopt behavior, and stay consistent
without waiting for humans.

94
00:06:00,424 --> 00:06:03,214
It becomes self our and self-healing.

95
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:09,874
This simple shift making metadata,
your first class situ, citizen turns

96
00:06:09,874 --> 00:06:13,204
fragile pipelines into strong platforms.

97
00:06:13,704 --> 00:06:20,049
It reduces firefighting and gives teams
the confident that the system can adopt.

98
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:21,549
As things change.

99
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:28,859
Once metadata becomes the foundation,
the system changes completely first.

100
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,334
Schema changes are no longer disaster.

101
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:36,664
Instead of pipelines, breaking the
system understand what change and

102
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:38,704
adjust downstream automatically.

103
00:06:39,694 --> 00:06:43,684
This means fever, suppress,
and fever ate costs.

104
00:06:44,184 --> 00:06:48,434
Second linear lineage
tracking becomes clear.

105
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:51,784
Every piece of data can be
traced back to each source.

106
00:06:52,284 --> 00:06:57,054
If your problem occur, we know where
it started and what was affected.

107
00:06:57,554 --> 00:07:02,339
There is no need for detective work
that quality checks are built in.

108
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,639
Rules travel with the data.

109
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:10,269
If something looks wrong, the system
alerts us before the data reaches reports.

110
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:13,949
Finally, the documentation
becomes self updating.

111
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:17,089
No more outdated wikis or spreadsheets.

112
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:22,059
Developers and analyst can always
see first correct information.

113
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:27,479
In short, metadata turns
pipelines into your living self.

114
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:33,169
Our system, instead of being fragile, the
platform becomes adoptive and reliable.

115
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:34,449
It gives engineers.

116
00:07:35,109 --> 00:07:39,549
More time to build new features, and
it gives the business more trust in

117
00:07:39,549 --> 00:07:42,119
the data that they use every day.

118
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:47,239
To make metadata driven systems
real, there are four key patterns.

119
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:49,999
The first is the metadata repository.

120
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:52,114
This is a central brain of the system.

121
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:57,679
It holds schemas, lineage, quality
rules, and operational details.

122
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,749
Everything is connected here.

123
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:02,379
The second is even driven architecture.

124
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,969
This means the system reacts immediately
to changes when your schema changes,

125
00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:13,939
when your jaw finishes, or when
your quality check fails even start

126
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:16,339
triggered, and the system adapt.

127
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:22,199
The third is service miss for the
data instead of big, fragile ETL jobs.

128
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,689
We use many small services.

129
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,869
Each one does a simple task well.

130
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:32,429
They connect through clear
interfaces, which makes the whole

131
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,319
system flexible and reusable.

132
00:08:34,819 --> 00:08:39,219
The fourth is policy, year
score, governance rules, privacy

133
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,439
checks, and retention policies.

134
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:42,969
Are written as code.

135
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:48,819
They are percent tested and deployed
just like any other software.

136
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:54,359
Together, these four patterns
create a platform that can scale

137
00:08:54,359 --> 00:09:00,389
smoothly, respond quickly, and remain
reliable as the business grows.

138
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:05,089
One of the best results of this
approach is a better experience

139
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:10,394
for developers instead of writing
complex ETL code developer use.

140
00:09:11,064 --> 00:09:17,084
Declarative data contracts, they
simply say what data they need and the

141
00:09:17,084 --> 00:09:19,334
system figures out how to deliver it.

142
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:24,514
Developers can also create test
environments instantly when yes,

143
00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:29,044
with your single command, your full
environment is ready for experiments,

144
00:09:29,644 --> 00:09:32,104
no longer weights, no manual setup.

145
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:36,564
Documentation is always for us
because it is generated from metadata.

146
00:09:37,064 --> 00:09:40,664
Teams no longer waste time
updating Wiki or slides.

147
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:45,664
The system itself explained what
data exceeds and how it flows.

148
00:09:46,164 --> 00:09:48,864
There is also intelligent discovery.

149
00:09:49,364 --> 00:09:54,434
The platform suggests useful
data sets, wants of risk and

150
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:56,054
highlights, connect sense.

151
00:09:56,684 --> 00:09:59,204
It's like having a smart
assistant for data.

152
00:09:59,704 --> 00:10:00,439
The result is clear.

153
00:10:00,939 --> 00:10:05,289
Less firefighting, more building
developers spend time creating

154
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:07,119
value, not fixing problems.

155
00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:13,599
Productivity goes up, moral goes up, and
the company benefits because engineers

156
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:16,059
are focused on innovation, not endless.

157
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:16,869
Maintenance

158
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:20,534
operations also improve with
metadata driven systems.

159
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:26,469
In traditional monitoring, we track things
like CP usage, memory, or job completion.

160
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:31,629
These are important, but they don't
tell us if the data itself correct.

161
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:37,049
With metadata, the system can
check business logic, for example.

162
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:42,839
Revenue numbers can be converted across
multiple sources to make sure they match.

163
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:43,879
The system.

164
00:10:44,064 --> 00:10:46,314
Also provides predictive detection.

165
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:51,674
By learning patterns from history,
it can warn us when something

166
00:10:51,674 --> 00:10:56,054
unusual is happening, such as
a certain drop in data volume.

167
00:10:56,554 --> 00:11:01,254
And when your problem does occur, the
system offers automated root cut analysis.

168
00:11:01,254 --> 00:11:06,344
It source exactly where the issue started
and which downstream systems are affected.

169
00:11:06,844 --> 00:11:09,454
These sales, our sub directive work.

170
00:11:09,954 --> 00:11:14,454
With these capabilities, operations,
sift from reactive firefighting

171
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:16,494
to proactive management.

172
00:11:16,994 --> 00:11:20,984
Instead of waiting for things to
break the system, help us stay

173
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:25,844
a again of issues and keep data
flowing smoothly for the business.

174
00:11:26,344 --> 00:11:31,594
Governance and complaints are often
seen as barriers, but with metadata,

175
00:11:31,594 --> 00:11:36,234
they become part of the system
itself through policy As code rules

176
00:11:36,234 --> 00:11:41,304
for data privacy, retention, and
access are return into the platform.

177
00:11:42,264 --> 00:11:42,624
They are tested.

178
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:47,829
And deployed like software, which
makes them reliable and consistent.

179
00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:53,069
This help with regulatory needs
instead of relying on manual checks,

180
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:55,799
compliance is built automatically.

181
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:02,479
This means less risk and more trust as
yay A is added into business intelligence.

182
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:07,099
We also need to ensure
fairness and transparency

183
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:09,249
with metadata driven T design.

184
00:12:09,969 --> 00:12:14,229
Bias checks and fairness rules
can be part of the system.

185
00:12:14,729 --> 00:12:19,879
The platform can flag when
data looks unbalanced or when

186
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:22,039
models show risky patterns.

187
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:25,629
This allows companies to
move faster without fear.

188
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:31,244
They can innovate, use AI, and
deliver insights while still

189
00:12:31,244 --> 00:12:33,674
say, staying ethical and fair.

190
00:12:34,174 --> 00:12:38,099
It build confident for both
engineers and decision makers.

191
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:39,589
That's very important.

192
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:44,919
In today's world, communists cannot
offer to be locked into one cloud vendor.

193
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:46,419
That's true.

194
00:12:47,294 --> 00:12:51,124
Metal meta trader driven
architecture helps avoid that trap.

195
00:12:51,624 --> 00:12:54,174
We provide agnostic pro processing.

196
00:12:54,804 --> 00:13:00,174
The same logic can run on AWS,
Azure or Google without rewriting.

197
00:13:00,674 --> 00:13:04,244
The processing rules are separated
from the cloud details, so

198
00:13:04,244 --> 00:13:06,224
teams can move workloads easily.

199
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:09,634
The system also supports
intelligent workload placement.

200
00:13:10,144 --> 00:13:13,324
Jobs can be placed based
on cost, performance, and

201
00:13:13,324 --> 00:13:16,084
complaints needs, for example.

202
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:22,714
Sensitive data may run in one region
for complaints while less sensitive

203
00:13:22,714 --> 00:13:25,294
work is run where costs are lower.

204
00:13:25,794 --> 00:13:28,824
Cross flow synchronization
is also very easier.

205
00:13:29,324 --> 00:13:34,954
The metadata layer tracks where
data lives and how it is used

206
00:13:35,254 --> 00:13:36,719
and whether it is up to date.

207
00:13:37,219 --> 00:13:42,619
This ensure consistency across environment
we thought endless manual effort.

208
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:47,349
This flexibility saves money,
avoids vendor locking and

209
00:13:47,349 --> 00:13:48,849
make the system feature flow.

210
00:13:49,349 --> 00:13:53,819
As cloud providers change their
offerings, the business can adapt quickly.

211
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:57,089
We without being tied down
to your single vendor.

212
00:13:57,589 --> 00:13:59,059
Big Bang Rerate are risky.

213
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:04,204
Instead, we use proven strategies
to move toward metadata driven

214
00:14:04,204 --> 00:14:05,704
platforms, step by step.

215
00:14:06,204 --> 00:14:11,964
The strangler fig pattern, let us build
their new systems alongside wall systems.

216
00:14:12,264 --> 00:14:14,804
Over time, the new replaces the world.

217
00:14:14,894 --> 00:14:16,964
We thought a big risky cutover.

218
00:14:17,464 --> 00:14:20,344
The metadata boots scrub
strategies are another option.

219
00:14:20,844 --> 00:14:24,684
We start by collecting metadata
from the existing systems we

220
00:14:24,684 --> 00:14:26,244
thought changing how they work.

221
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:31,559
This gives immediate benefits, like
better documentation and lineage tracking.

222
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:34,369
We can also build a center of excellence.

223
00:14:34,969 --> 00:14:37,294
Your somal expert team leads the way.

224
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:41,204
Creates reference
implementations and train others.

225
00:14:41,704 --> 00:14:45,424
They guide the whole committee
in adopting new patents.

226
00:14:45,924 --> 00:14:51,149
Finally, they use incremental rollout
instead of trying to do everything at

227
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:56,029
once, we start with high value areas
like schema management or lineage.

228
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:00,589
Once those are stable, we
expand to other capabilities.

229
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:06,669
These strategies make transformation
possible, practical and less stressful.

230
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:07,689
For teams.

231
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:09,559
Success needs to be measured.

232
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:11,719
We matter the driven system.

233
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:13,879
We can track real improvements.

234
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:18,354
We have seen an 80 P percentage
reduction in manual interventions.

235
00:15:18,774 --> 00:15:23,364
This means engineers spend for
less time fixing broken pipelines.

236
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:30,519
We have also achieved 99.9%
reliability in critical PEA systems.

237
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:34,139
Dashboards and reports are
available when business users

238
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:36,389
need them building trust in data.

239
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:40,939
Another key outcome is 40
percentage cost reduction.

240
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:47,049
By optimization workloads and using
resources more efficiently, companies

241
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:49,119
save money while delivering more.

242
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:52,889
Those numbers are not
just technical metrics.

243
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,839
They represent better business
outcomes, faster delivery of new

244
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,939
features, greater confident in decision
making, and more efficient use of

245
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:05,299
resources, and the improvements.

246
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:05,959
Don't stop.

247
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:12,319
Because metadata given visibility into
every part of the system, teams can

248
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:15,079
keep tracking, adjusting and improving.

249
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:20,679
Continuous improvement becomes part
of the culture, not a one time event.

250
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:24,934
This make the platform smarter
and stronger over time.

251
00:16:25,434 --> 00:16:27,414
These ideas are not just theory.

252
00:16:28,344 --> 00:16:32,454
I have implemented metadata driven
platforms in large enterprises,

253
00:16:32,544 --> 00:16:33,559
and the results are clear.

254
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:39,039
In one case, the company achieved an
85 percentage drop in manual fixes.

255
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:43,739
Engineers were no longer spend
spending their days firefighting.

256
00:16:44,714 --> 00:16:47,384
Which freed them to work on new solutions.

257
00:16:47,884 --> 00:16:53,044
Reliability also reached 99.9
percentage for mission critical business

258
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:59,154
Intelligence leaders could trust their
dashboard knowing they would always be

259
00:16:59,154 --> 00:17:01,434
available with fresh, accurate data.

260
00:17:01,934 --> 00:17:06,679
On top of that, the company saved
40 per 40 percentage in cost.

261
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:11,679
By optimizing workloads across
multiple clouds and making

262
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,509
smarter use of resources.

263
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:19,439
Most importantly, business teams moved
from being reactive to proactive.

264
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:24,949
Instead of worrying about broken
reports, they use data to innovate

265
00:17:25,714 --> 00:17:27,954
operations and serve customers better.

266
00:17:28,454 --> 00:17:32,114
This is the real impact of
metadata driven platforms.

267
00:17:32,624 --> 00:17:34,754
They don't just fix technical issues.

268
00:17:35,114 --> 00:17:39,734
They change how the entire
company uses data, creating

269
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:42,134
space for growth and innovation.

270
00:17:42,634 --> 00:17:44,089
What excites me most is.

271
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:48,829
How this approach advances the
whole field of data architecture.

272
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:53,589
By treating metadata as the nervous
system, we have moved beyond the

273
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:55,869
world idea of pipeline as cold.

274
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:01,769
Now we think in terms of policies
and transformation as metadata, the

275
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:05,819
shift makes systems more flexible,
adaptive, and easier to manage.

276
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:11,584
It also brings even driven design
together with metadata repositories.

277
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:14,904
Creating platforms that are self-healing.

278
00:18:15,404 --> 00:18:19,664
When something changes, the system
reacts automatically instead

279
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:22,714
of waiting for engineers, this
is more than just improvement.

280
00:18:23,704 --> 00:18:28,534
This is a new architecture, yet different
way of designing enterprise systems.

281
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:33,479
It help us scale to cloud level
data volumes while still keeping

282
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,159
system reliable and efficient.

283
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:43,199
So metadata driven design isnt just about
solving today's problem, it is shaping

284
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:45,629
the future of enterprise data platforms.

285
00:18:46,129 --> 00:18:51,769
It shows how companies can campaign
cloud yay a and governance into

286
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:53,629
one strong adaptive system.

287
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:59,349
The future becomes even more exciting once
metadata driven platforms are in place.

288
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:05,854
First, we will see yay driven optimization
in the system itself will land from

289
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:08,704
patterns of use and adjust automatically.

290
00:19:09,634 --> 00:19:15,004
For example, it can optimize performance
or reduce cost without human intervention.

291
00:19:15,504 --> 00:19:19,374
Second, we will see automated
data, product creations.

292
00:19:19,874 --> 00:19:24,284
Business users will simply describe
what they need in natural language.

293
00:19:24,434 --> 00:19:28,199
The platform will then create the
pipelines and deliver the data.

294
00:19:28,364 --> 00:19:33,034
We thought weeks of engineering
efforts, that platform will

295
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:33,934
provide real time adoption.

296
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:39,384
As business condition change, like a
sudden market shift, the system can

297
00:19:39,504 --> 00:19:41,694
adjust data processing on its own.

298
00:19:42,194 --> 00:19:44,054
These are not far off dreams.

299
00:19:44,594 --> 00:19:46,244
These are next steps.

300
00:19:46,244 --> 00:19:50,674
Once metadata is central, the
foundation we laid today opens

301
00:19:50,794 --> 00:19:56,224
the door to systems that not only
run, but also think and adapt.

302
00:19:56,724 --> 00:19:59,774
This is a real feature of
enterprise data architecture.

303
00:20:00,274 --> 00:20:03,479
Building this kind of platform
is not just a technical shift,

304
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:05,759
it is also a cultural one.

305
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:10,729
Companies that make move to
metadata driven architecture

306
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:12,979
will gain real advantages.

307
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:15,079
They can innovate faster.

308
00:20:15,574 --> 00:20:20,994
Because engineers are not stuck fixing
broken systems, they can run more reliably

309
00:20:21,504 --> 00:20:23,724
because the platform heals itself.

310
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:28,294
They can make smarter decision
because data is trusted and

311
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:30,694
they can scale without kios.

312
00:20:30,904 --> 00:20:34,899
Because complexity is managed at
the metadata level, the midnight

313
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:37,509
crisis may never fully disappear.

314
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:40,684
Combo systems will always face a pressure.

315
00:20:41,454 --> 00:20:44,694
But the difference is
how companies respond.

316
00:20:45,194 --> 00:20:50,714
With metadata driven system challenges
are handled smoothly and automatically.

317
00:20:51,214 --> 00:20:55,774
In the end, organization that
accept this change will lead

318
00:20:55,774 --> 00:20:57,319
in the data driven economy.

319
00:20:57,819 --> 00:21:02,824
They will turn their data from your
burden into your true to advantage.

320
00:21:03,574 --> 00:21:07,414
This is what it means to build
the platform of tomorrow.

321
00:21:07,914 --> 00:21:11,304
These approaches having stayed
hidden inside one company.

322
00:21:11,574 --> 00:21:14,244
They have been shared and ED widely.

323
00:21:14,744 --> 00:21:19,574
They have been presented at professional
conferences on forums where experts

324
00:21:19,574 --> 00:21:21,524
in data and a discuss their impact.

325
00:21:22,034 --> 00:21:26,714
They have been adopted as reference
models by multiple global organization.

326
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:30,674
Who saw their value and
wanted to copy the approach.

327
00:21:31,174 --> 00:21:35,164
They have also been published
as frameworks, making it easier

328
00:21:35,164 --> 00:21:39,274
for companies and teams to learn
from these ideas and apply them.

329
00:21:39,774 --> 00:21:45,384
The fact that these practice are
being repeated, reused and scaled by

330
00:21:45,384 --> 00:21:50,334
others is powerful proof it source
that metadata driven architecture

331
00:21:50,689 --> 00:21:52,939
is not just a one off solution.

332
00:21:53,584 --> 00:21:56,824
It is the best practice for
modern enterprise systems.

333
00:21:57,324 --> 00:21:59,844
This kind of acceptance is very important.

334
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:04,594
It shows that industry serves this
value in this design, and it helps

335
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:08,649
spread the benefits to many more
organizations across the world.

336
00:22:09,149 --> 00:22:11,669
Thank you for spending
your time with me today.

337
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:17,279
We started this task in Pipeline
Health, sleepless night, broken

338
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:19,949
dashboard, and constant fighting.

339
00:22:20,449 --> 00:22:24,529
Then we saw how metadata driven
systems can change everything.

340
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:27,919
They detect problems adapt automatically.

341
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:29,914
And heal themselves.

342
00:22:30,414 --> 00:22:31,794
We looked at real numbers.

343
00:22:32,664 --> 00:22:36,294
These are not just technical
