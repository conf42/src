00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,930
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:06,690
today I'm going to discuss about how the
back cell power delivery is helping in

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,510
the chip design, to reduce the IR drop.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,360
That means power ation in the chip and
improve the performance and even improve

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,130
the signal integrity, between the.

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:26,290
Signals in the design or in the chip,
like how it is helping, through the chip.

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,680
I'm going to discuss on this
more in my coming slides.

8
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,930
So coming to that backside
power delivery network.

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,879
Now, we'll call it as A-B-S-P-D-N.

10
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:39,349
It's a technology currently,
or opting, like in the.

11
00:00:39,849 --> 00:00:45,219
Two m below that, two nanometer
below that technologies.

12
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:51,189
So it's a revolutionary because earlier
visit to have that, whole, the power

13
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:53,229
delivery on the front side of the design.

14
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:55,049
Along with the signals.

15
00:00:55,769 --> 00:01:01,000
So suppose like if you have the metal
layers of 15, then the top metal layers

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,579
will go for power and the next metal
layers will go for the clock, and

17
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:07,380
the remaining metal layers is go for.

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,300
Signal.

19
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,390
So because of that, we can't use all
the metal layers but signals and there

20
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,190
is no availability of the, for the
routing resources, for the signals.

21
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:23,620
Because of that, we move that most of
the backside, most of the power routes

22
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,070
in the backside through nano silicone.

23
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:28,740
Through Silicon vs.

24
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,810
We are making like a reducing the
stop state of the chip and we are

25
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:41,260
putting like a sending the VS through
that to connect that backside power.

26
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,540
So it's a revolution in the chip design
currently opting like, many of the lower

27
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,120
level node like Intel, TSMC and Samsung.

28
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:56,040
This actually earlier as I mentioned,
the power and signal are in the, of the

29
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,900
design, but here we are moving that entire
power into the backside of the design.

30
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,060
And, we are using like,
continue this one to the.

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,240
DS V. This is helping like a
significant improvement in the

32
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,750
performance, efficiency and power.

33
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,380
So this incorporat like silicon.

34
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,175
We, for that power delivery
through Silicon Subrate, we are

35
00:02:18,175 --> 00:02:19,775
attending like a silicon subrate.

36
00:02:20,275 --> 00:02:20,875
substrates.

37
00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:23,215
SUBRATE means it's a CMOs device.

38
00:02:23,245 --> 00:02:25,465
There's a substrate in the CMOs device.

39
00:02:26,155 --> 00:02:31,755
So we are making like as much as, thinning
because of, to connect that backside

40
00:02:31,755 --> 00:02:34,245
power with the front side of the design.

41
00:02:34,245 --> 00:02:37,085
Integrating that front side of
the design with, through silicon

42
00:02:37,085 --> 00:02:41,975
V is routing congestion, air
drop, improving that activity.

43
00:02:42,475 --> 00:02:47,075
In Intel's power via implementation and
further developments are going in the

44
00:02:47,465 --> 00:02:50,945
other manufacturers like TSMC and Samsung.

45
00:02:51,445 --> 00:02:54,835
So I'm going to discuss more
about on this in my coming slides.

46
00:02:55,335 --> 00:02:59,625
So if you're coming to that traditional
power delivery limitations, these are

47
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:05,145
routing congestion in advanced, the five
nanometer and below there will be like,

48
00:03:05,195 --> 00:03:10,265
Most of that 40% of our routing resources
is control by the power delivery.

49
00:03:11,195 --> 00:03:14,815
And, remaining goes to the clock
and signal as, metal just carrying

50
00:03:14,815 --> 00:03:19,135
down in the lower technology to 24
nanometer higher drop increasing

51
00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:23,275
dramatically by 45% compared with
the previously technology notes.

52
00:03:23,845 --> 00:03:28,305
So it's a severely constrained in the
signal routing options because we don't

53
00:03:28,305 --> 00:03:31,225
have the, routing sources for the signals.

54
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,520
So for this, we are moving
to that, the backside power.

55
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,370
And also there is a other
disadvantage, water degradation.

56
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,350
like the technologies are,
going down, like we are going

57
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,240
towards the two nanometer.

58
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,460
So the what is operating, what
is also will come down now,

59
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,390
like 0.7 volts and, it drops.

60
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:53,600
What?

61
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,520
It drops also significantly 20 15% across
the day during the high competition loads.

62
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,240
Even like in the critical corners,
it's increasing like 16.5%.

63
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,200
So this is like another
disadvantage, with the front side.

64
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,620
So there is a power supply noise.

65
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,510
Currently the dynamic Power
Circuit operation generates

66
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,620
a substantial power supply.

67
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,420
Noise is reaching, 85 to 95 MTSS peak
to peak, under typical workloads.

68
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,705
This is a regular, normal,
power turbine, supplies.

69
00:04:25,205 --> 00:04:30,885
And in place fluctuations, said 22% from
nominal values, security and timing.

70
00:04:30,885 --> 00:04:31,605
Predictability.

71
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:36,755
So this p report delivery, very
hard feature, how it'll be the,

72
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:40,205
as I mentioned earlier, they were
processing, we reading that, this

73
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:45,685
substrate as much as less possible
to make it like, to get high yield.

74
00:04:45,805 --> 00:04:51,195
Along with that, With, battery yield
and reducing that substrate sub subrate

75
00:04:51,195 --> 00:04:55,095
to 12 to 50 micron thickness with
exceptional control maintained within

76
00:04:55,135 --> 00:05:01,315
45 micron, across the 300 millimeter
wave advanced TV fabrication use,

77
00:05:01,325 --> 00:05:06,805
remarkable s of, 10 to one in, backside
Power delivery is a featuring like

78
00:05:06,865 --> 00:05:12,715
ultra fine via diameters under to 200
nanometer and beside depth exceeding to.

79
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,290
2.5 microns.

80
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,320
So power level implementation,
specialized backside.

81
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:23,465
Metal stack utilizing advanced
copper metalization techniques.

82
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:30,565
Use low sheet resistance of, point knot
one five, m for the engineered three layer

83
00:05:30,565 --> 00:05:34,435
power distribution network with optimized
4.2 micrometer thickness, delivers

84
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:36,700
substantial, 58% reduction in the.

85
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:42,570
PDN implements, compared to conventional
approaches, the system benefits

86
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:47,470
significant election in, required met
layer from conventional, like conventional

87
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,480
10 to 12, like 10 to 15 even, met layers.

88
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:57,430
Now it is, we are moving to 7, 2 8,
for the same, frequency, so signal.

89
00:05:57,895 --> 00:06:04,195
Interconnect length decreases by 25% and
that they contributing to the dynamic

90
00:06:04,695 --> 00:06:08,895
traumatic cause delay improvement
of 35% while cement signal pro stock

91
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:13,435
by 42% because of, more routing
sources available for the signals.

92
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:17,885
So it improves the performance and
it's a state and weak power as,

93
00:06:17,885 --> 00:06:20,770
there are more vs for the, power.

94
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:24,855
And the more routings is available for
the signal, there will be less crosstalk.

95
00:06:25,355 --> 00:06:28,205
So if you're comparing the performance
between the traditional, power delivery

96
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:32,985
network and backside power delivery
network, the sistance is, traditional.

97
00:06:32,985 --> 00:06:36,825
It is like one 50% and ambassador power,
it is a hundred percent the poor concept.

98
00:06:37,755 --> 00:06:41,715
What for, If you're comparing with the
WA four millimeters squared, then it

99
00:06:41,715 --> 00:06:49,305
is 2.5 in the conventional and 1.75,
and a metal area says it is 35% and

100
00:06:49,355 --> 00:06:51,125
15% in the backside power delivery.

101
00:06:51,815 --> 00:06:58,265
Pdn, it is a hundred percent, 155% I drop
it is a hundred percent in the, if you're

102
00:06:58,265 --> 00:07:01,640
comparing with a hundred percent, then
it'll be like 40% with the B-S-P-D-N.

103
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,429
Metal layers will be calmed down.

104
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:07,510
It is if you are getting with eight in
the traditional, and it'll be like three.

105
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,829
So while manufacturing, we
have to capture these things.

106
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:16,109
We tending, tending or to five
to 10 microns, with exceptional

107
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:21,059
surface integration below two
nanometer or Ness TS integration.

108
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:25,274
Hi Christian, 500 nanometer TSP
featuring industrial leading tenish.

109
00:07:25,274 --> 00:07:29,684
One has aspect ratio with the near
vertical, 89.8 plus or minus 0.2,

110
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:34,574
decreased side wall profiles, and the
thermal management TSV replacement

111
00:07:34,724 --> 00:07:39,794
architecture, the critical thermal grads
by 40%, enhancing the device reliability.

112
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:46,324
So these are like the helping the, we have
to catch the, this while manufacturing

113
00:07:46,324 --> 00:07:48,499
for the back still power delivery.

114
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,870
So design methodology, observation,
so machine learning optimization, 68%

115
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,700
action in design cycles with, 40% I
improvement and power delivery network.

116
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,700
Advanced simulation dose.

117
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,510
If you, with the 3D Electromatic
technology achieving like it's a

118
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,594
94% coalition with the whatever
we get with the actual silicon.

119
00:08:08,095 --> 00:08:12,200
post silicon measurements,
power ga certific like best,

120
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,740
TSV placement algorithms.

121
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:19,980
Will it reduce like the higher drop
voltage drop by 48% across critical path?

122
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,870
The most of the leading, companies
that are opting this, backside

123
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,980
power delivery currently.

124
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:31,040
So this will reduce like the thermal
disp and improve the current density

125
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,440
across, different, multiple designs.

126
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,595
The, even the run time.

127
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:39,795
Also with that one, the run time
will be increased by 70% improvement.

128
00:08:40,295 --> 00:08:43,935
The, it'll exit the time
to market of the designs.

129
00:08:44,435 --> 00:08:48,365
So these are measure players
currently opting the backside power

130
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:55,526
delivery intel power via currently
Intel is opted, the old means 7.8

131
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,435
er, the Intel, latest technology.

132
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,029
It is the current, TSMs.

133
00:09:00,094 --> 00:09:00,964
Latest technology.

134
00:09:00,964 --> 00:09:04,744
TSMC, not at comeback, but Intel
is working on this 1.8 nanometer.

135
00:09:05,494 --> 00:09:07,024
so faster.

136
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:08,534
Updated in the intel, technologies.

137
00:09:09,074 --> 00:09:13,094
Intel latest technologies, it's
actually like a 30%, power delivery,

138
00:09:13,484 --> 00:09:16,314
efficiency, and, the current, improvement.

139
00:09:16,314 --> 00:09:19,314
Also, it's a 2.8 amps
for millimeter square.

140
00:09:19,814 --> 00:09:24,014
While maintain like a four plus or minus
4% voltage regulation across the day.

141
00:09:24,594 --> 00:09:28,944
TSMC has invested like the 2.8 billion
on this backstory, power delivery.

142
00:09:29,244 --> 00:09:33,204
They're working on this, demonstr,
exceptionally like 28% power efficiency

143
00:09:33,204 --> 00:09:37,074
with, their predicting and with
the 15% performance improvement.

144
00:09:37,574 --> 00:09:42,704
In the two M process node, Samsung
Hal up to this one, vertical

145
00:09:42,704 --> 00:09:44,744
power delivery with the TSVs.

146
00:09:45,204 --> 00:09:51,084
one 50 nanometer diameters with
the same finished one as aspect

147
00:09:51,084 --> 00:09:55,814
of TSVs advanced Metalation
Techniques Seal 2.2 x electronic.

148
00:09:56,249 --> 00:09:59,309
Aggression resistance, computation,
power delivery architectures

149
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,009
with this, Samsung technologies.

150
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:04,179
So feature aspects 2025 and beyond.

151
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:05,709
I said 25%.

152
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,499
market adoption in the.

153
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:13,269
2025. predicting for the, high
performance computing and, mobile

154
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:17,999
applications, say 25% predicting will
adopt this, backside power delivery

155
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:19,499
with the latest advance nodes.

156
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,189
And a market opportunity
is like 85 5 billion.

157
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:28,549
for the technology integration across
semi sectors, 40%, efficiency improvement

158
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:34,409
for efficiency gains in, next generation
sites, rising advanced, the, BSPD

159
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:37,319
and our teacher with, compared to
that conventional, front cell power

160
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:41,279
delivery, the current density entity,
it's for four ramps for millimeter

161
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,199
square peak current handling capacity
while maintaining precise, plus

162
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:47,589
minus 3.5%, across all regulations.

163
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:52,519
Advanced research insureds now
exit towards, breakthrough BSPD and

164
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:58,629
implementations with the unprecedented
specific teams are developing ultra mini

165
00:10:58,989 --> 00:11:04,369
TSP structures, with the diameters below
hundred nanometer and, revolutionary one.

166
00:11:04,369 --> 00:11:09,024
currently like we are, How the 300
nanometer and a 200 nanometer TSPs,

167
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:14,334
so the current, they're working on
to reduce that, diameters to hundred

168
00:11:14,334 --> 00:11:16,334
nanometer and, expect of the list.

169
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:19,274
One, it'll improve the
width and the depth of that.

170
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:19,484
we.

171
00:11:19,984 --> 00:11:24,854
And also the junction temperature, beyond
and improving that current, density.

172
00:11:25,364 --> 00:11:27,074
So the work is still going on.

173
00:11:27,074 --> 00:11:27,464
This.

174
00:11:27,544 --> 00:11:32,064
so for metrics across manufacturers
for change, implement inte leads with

175
00:11:32,064 --> 00:11:37,884
the 30% improvement followed by TS
MC 28%, and Samsung at 25% with their

176
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:39,954
backside power delivery implementations.

177
00:11:40,754 --> 00:11:46,699
TSV yield rates closely intellectual,
high manufacturing patient with, 19.95

178
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:53,664
TSV rate while TSMC and, Samsung, follows
by closely by 98, 99 0.8 and 99.7.

179
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:57,574
Current density city, power via
technology enabled intel to reach

180
00:11:57,754 --> 00:11:59,884
2.8 times for millimeters square.

181
00:12:00,334 --> 00:12:05,429
and the Samsung and TSM just, logging on
this, Just below, temperature reduction.

182
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:08,949
All manufacture choose, significant
cooling benefits with, inate using

183
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:12,330
temperature by eight degrees ingrade
while t Samsung seven degrees.

184
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,830
The temperature is, performs metrics
for the back power delivery, feature.

185
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,730
Implications, density
improvement implement is not just

186
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,990
transfer density improvement.

187
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:27,940
Also, along with the performance
improvement, competition powerment,

188
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,470
it is like 25% improvement.

189
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,615
with the traditional delivery
network, the power is reduced by

190
00:12:33,615 --> 00:12:39,580
35, 2 40% with the different metal
layers, performance enhancements.

191
00:12:40,195 --> 00:12:44,375
Overall performance efficiency improved by
2020 5% with the dynamic power, reduction.

192
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:47,795
30% in, high performance
competing measurement, and

193
00:12:47,795 --> 00:12:51,665
35% who design flexibility
separation of power and signal.

194
00:12:51,845 --> 00:12:54,515
do domains enable 30 reduction
in routing complexity.

195
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:59,365
It'll reduce the routing resources with
the average violent, also will come

196
00:12:59,365 --> 00:13:03,855
down to 2020 5% required, metal air
reduction from, it'll also come down to.

197
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,010
Metal layers right into instructed while
we are going with the less metal layers.

198
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:13,025
78, for the same functional
8%, 18% delay reduction.

199
00:13:13,525 --> 00:13:15,235
Economic impact and co conclusions.

200
00:13:15,235 --> 00:13:17,965
ancient cost of this,
will increase 18 to 22%.

201
00:13:18,445 --> 00:13:23,135
return of vestment timelines will
be like, 15, 12, 20 months For

202
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:27,865
data center implementations, yield,
implement 80%, higher than conventional

203
00:13:27,865 --> 00:13:32,925
process, then cycle at 25% reduction
design cycle enrollment, cycle time.

204
00:13:33,425 --> 00:13:35,815
this is, as a advanced technology.

205
00:13:35,905 --> 00:13:40,025
Currently most of the lower
technology nodes, we are, adopting

206
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:41,525
in the lower technology nodes.

207
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:42,875
in the cheap design.

208
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:48,390
So for the, to reduce the power
and improve the performance

209
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,870
and, reduce the ity issues.

210
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,920
So thank you.

211
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,720
Thank you for listening.

212
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,310
Thank you very much.
