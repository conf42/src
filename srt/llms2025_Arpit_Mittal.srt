1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,310
Good morning and good evening.

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,570
I'm api.

4
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,310
I have about 14 plus years experience
working in the payment industries.

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,460
Currently I'm working as a staff
software engineer in PayPal.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,020
Today I will be giving a talk on
revolutionizing payment security

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,640
and user experience, AI driven fraud
prevention and realtime personalization

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,080
in the modern payment systems.

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,680
We'll discuss how AI is
transforming the payment, security

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,070
and personalization through the
realtime case studies and metrics.

11
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,550
Payment security has evolved a lot.

12
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,440
Let me give you a few examples
in which payment security plays a

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,930
crucial role in the payment platforms.

14
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,890
Most of the customers
forgot their password.

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,730
The platform need OTP and email
based authentication to have

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,670
those customers, the customers.

17
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:55,625
They want to, they will type their
credit card information, name, address,

18
00:00:55,625 --> 00:01:00,535
first time, but they don't want to
put all those details again and again

19
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:02,215
while doing the future purchases.

20
00:01:02,785 --> 00:01:07,505
They want those details to be auto-filled
for them next time so that they can

21
00:01:07,505 --> 00:01:10,955
just click next and then they will
be able to complete the purchases.

22
00:01:11,455 --> 00:01:14,875
The customers they want to use crypto.

23
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,560
They want to use different
funding instruments.

24
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,650
For example, gift calls to make
the purchases customer want to

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,840
have buy now pay later capability.

26
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,020
They don't want to pay
the amount immediately.

27
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,800
They want to pay the amount
in future in installments.

28
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,985
Customer want to use coupons,
discounts to make the payments.

29
00:01:37,485 --> 00:01:41,985
So all in all these scenarios, there
will be some information that will

30
00:01:41,985 --> 00:01:43,935
be collected by our payment platform.

31
00:01:44,435 --> 00:01:48,965
All that information, for example,
the credit card information, the

32
00:01:48,965 --> 00:01:54,575
crypto related information, the
name, address, all those details

33
00:01:54,755 --> 00:02:00,355
need to be encrypted, need to be
stored in the PCI compliant format.

34
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:06,135
So that customer will feel
safe while using your platform

35
00:02:06,645 --> 00:02:08,055
and doing the transactions.

36
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:13,805
So with the global online transactions
surpassing 6.3 trillion annually, cyber

37
00:02:13,805 --> 00:02:17,315
criminals are deploying increasingly
sophisticated attack methods.

38
00:02:17,675 --> 00:02:20,795
This unprecedented volume of
digital payments create complex

39
00:02:20,795 --> 00:02:24,695
security challenges that traditional
systems struggle to address.

40
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:29,975
While robust security measures
are essential, customers demand

41
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:32,015
friction free transactions.

42
00:02:32,345 --> 00:02:35,555
Modern payment systems must strike
the perfect balance between the

43
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:39,425
stringent fraud prevention and
seamless authentication that keeps

44
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:42,725
legitimate users moving smoothly
throughout their payment journey.

45
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:49,465
AI driven fraud prevention plays a crucial
role as well in the payment platform.

46
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:52,135
Let me give you a few examples.

47
00:02:52,735 --> 00:02:55,135
Consider a customer who is a bad customer.

48
00:02:55,135 --> 00:02:58,705
He's a terrorist, he's purchasing
bad items using your platform.

49
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,109
We don't want to allow that
customer to purchase the items.

50
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:07,320
A customer who is a fraudulent customer
and who is doing transactions on

51
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,529
behalf of a real customer and he's
doing transactions at an unusual

52
00:03:12,529 --> 00:03:15,140
location, at an unusual time.

53
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:21,859
A customer who is making a large
payment, large international payment

54
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:25,159
at an unusual time, a customer.

55
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:29,614
Who has bad records registered
against your platform?

56
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,375
So we want to stop all those customers.

57
00:03:33,335 --> 00:03:38,704
We want to analyze the behavior for those
customers, and if it devi deviates from

58
00:03:38,704 --> 00:03:43,655
the normal behavior, then we want to stop
all those customers using our platform.

59
00:03:44,155 --> 00:03:48,055
So our cutting edge AI engine
harnesses machine learning to analyze

60
00:03:48,055 --> 00:03:51,475
over 1 billion transactions daily,
identifying suspicious patterns

61
00:03:51,475 --> 00:03:53,185
that traditional systems will miss.

62
00:03:53,815 --> 00:03:58,345
Through sophisticated dynamic risk
scoring and continuous model optimization,

63
00:03:58,345 --> 00:04:00,055
we have delivered exceptional result.

64
00:04:00,415 --> 00:04:07,045
A 76% reduction in fraudulent transactions
while slashing false positives by 92%,

65
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:11,905
dramatically improving both security
and customer satisfaction by processing

66
00:04:11,905 --> 00:04:13,855
more than 200 distinct data points.

67
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:15,355
Paul transaction in real time.

68
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:19,375
Our system makes highly accurate
fraud prevention decisions in

69
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:22,480
under a hundred milliseconds
faster than the blink of an eye.

70
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,570
There are few more scenarios.

71
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,620
Consider a customer who has
been onboarded on your platform.

72
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,140
He did not submit it, his driver
license, social security number,

73
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,880
and we have allowed that particular
customer to use our platform,

74
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,040
so the onboarding should
be smoother and all that.

75
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,800
Driver license social security number.

76
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,870
Social security number.

77
00:04:47,515 --> 00:04:52,455
The biometric authentication,
all those things require ai.

78
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:57,345
And using AI we can do the smoother
onboarding for the customers.

79
00:04:57,845 --> 00:05:02,995
Let's go through the few case studies are
a retail giant fraud prevention success.

82% reduction in fraud, 95% fewer
false positives, 1.8 million recovered

88
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,960
revenue, and 23% boost in customer
satisfaction within three months.

89
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,380
Let's go over few more case studies.

90
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,980
Our AI powered solution has also been
used for few crypto companies who got

91
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,010
bankrupt and when they partnered with us.

yet frictionless payment ecosystem.

170
00:11:01,705 --> 00:11:04,555
So in future, how the
payments will happen?

171
00:11:05,185 --> 00:11:08,425
Let me tell you, based
on my thought process.

172
00:11:08,925 --> 00:11:13,475
So the payments right now, those
are happening through the cards

173
00:11:13,895 --> 00:11:18,155
and those are made of plastic and
they're harmful for our environment.

174
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:22,495
So in future, what will happen is
all those payments will be done.

175
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:26,814
through the fingerprinting, through the
facial authentication of those customers,

176
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,515
and those will be tied to the cards.

177
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,855
And with that customer will
be able to make the payment.

178
00:11:32,355 --> 00:11:35,325
Customer will have the smart
homes, they will have the small

179
00:11:35,325 --> 00:11:36,855
devices inside their home.

180
00:11:37,755 --> 00:11:43,335
They can feed the data of how
frequently they want groceries to

181
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,225
be delivered, which items they want.

182
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:47,575
they want to be delivered to their home.

183
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:50,535
How, what time?

184
00:11:50,595 --> 00:11:54,635
Those grocery items should come and
they will have the subscription.

185
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,935
They'll put all those details and
groceries will be automatically

186
00:11:57,935 --> 00:12:00,755
delivered to the customer address
and automatically the payment will

187
00:12:00,755 --> 00:12:02,975
be made from those smart devices.

188
00:12:03,475 --> 00:12:08,245
Customers when they are going to the
gas station to fill the gas, there

189
00:12:08,245 --> 00:12:11,935
will be small devices inside the
car through which the, automatically

190
00:12:11,935 --> 00:12:15,115
the payment will be done and the
customer will be able to fill.

191
00:12:15,115 --> 00:12:15,715
The gas

192
00:12:16,215 --> 00:12:19,665
customer will use all the
voice assistant systems.

193
00:12:19,665 --> 00:12:24,405
For example, Alexa, Google
Assistant, shitty assistant.

194
00:12:24,905 --> 00:12:30,495
So all these systems, they will just
instruct about, like about the payment

195
00:12:30,495 --> 00:12:33,525
and which items they want to purchase,
and automatically those items will

196
00:12:33,525 --> 00:12:34,965
be delivered to their home address.

197
00:12:35,465 --> 00:12:39,815
So we'll experience hyper pro
personalized payment journeys that

198
00:12:39,815 --> 00:12:43,265
adapt to individual preferences while
maintaining bank graded security.

199
00:12:43,765 --> 00:12:45,895
So the key takeaways and the next steps.

200
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,600
AI is revolutionizing
the payment security.

201
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,220
Advanced algorithms and machine learning
are creating unprecedented levels of fraud

202
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,810
prevention while reducing false positives
and enabling smoother transactions.

203
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,530
Personalization drives
miserable business value.

204
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,610
AI powered personalization doesn't
just improve customer experience.

205
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,030
It delivers concrete results
with higher transaction values

206
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,010
