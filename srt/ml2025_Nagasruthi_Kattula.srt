1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,280
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,060
This is Shruti.

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,650
Today we'll be covering into how AI
is transforming security architectures

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,990
and cloud-based CRM systems.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,860
We'll be looking into real world
enterprise implementations across

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,280
multiple industries, and we'll
examine the practical intersection

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,465
of how machine learning capabilities
can help robust security frameworks

8
00:00:22,015 --> 00:00:23,345
through detailed case studies.

9
00:00:23,455 --> 00:00:26,820
From Starbucks, capital One,
Mayo Clinic, JP Morgan Chase,

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,040
we'll uncover both successes.

11
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:32,384
And critical failures that
provide valuable lessons

12
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:34,155
for our own implementations.

13
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:40,545
In today's agenda, we'll be covering about
the core concepts of machine learning,

14
00:00:41,205 --> 00:00:42,580
and we'll be going through case study.

15
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,150
One by one, which is Starbucks, followed
by Capital One breach, and then how

16
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,260
in the healthcare machine learning
security is transforming the industry.

17
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,180
And last but not least, the JP
Morgan Chase multi-cloud machine

18
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,100
learning security and how the
security is orchestration, how the

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,695
security is orchestrating across.

20
00:01:04,185 --> 00:01:05,265
Multiple platforms.

21
00:01:05,535 --> 00:01:09,465
So our session will move from theoretical
foundations to practical implementation

22
00:01:09,465 --> 00:01:11,505
strategies with each case study.

23
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:14,145
Building upon the lessons
of previous examples.

24
00:01:15,585 --> 00:01:20,205
In the current security architecture,
the challenges that we often face

25
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:25,250
are manual threat detection, which is
sometimes awfully long and painful.

26
00:01:26,115 --> 00:01:28,965
We take reactive security
posters, which is.

27
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,940
What we do after the security
incident happens, rather than

28
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,710
protecting it proactively, we
have stat static access controls,

29
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,090
which needs maintenance over time.

30
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,560
And have to adjust based on
the industry requirements.

31
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,369
We have limited visibility across
platforms where the security doesn't

32
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:53,369
really talk and it works in silos in
each platform with machine learning, we

33
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:58,740
have automated analy detection, which is
continuously learning from data patterns.

34
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:02,105
And it detects the anomalies
and flags to the system.

35
00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:05,255
We have predictive threat
modeling, which predicts the

36
00:02:05,255 --> 00:02:07,295
threats even before they occur.

37
00:02:07,355 --> 00:02:11,765
By behavioral analysis, we have
adaptive access management, which

38
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:16,685
switches the accesses dynamically
based on the role of the accessor.

39
00:02:17,465 --> 00:02:21,365
The platform security correlation
helps in orchestrating the

40
00:02:21,365 --> 00:02:23,225
security across multiple platforms.

41
00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:26,045
And this is what we'll see in
the multi-cloud architecture by

42
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:30,075
JP Morgan J. Machine learning
fundamentally transforms cloud

43
00:02:30,075 --> 00:02:34,515
security by enabling systems to learn
automatically from the data patterns,

44
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:39,495
predict potential vulnerabilities,
and take defenses in real time.

45
00:02:40,455 --> 00:02:44,475
This shift from reactive to proactive
security postures is particularly

46
00:02:44,475 --> 00:02:48,645
crucial in customer relationship
management industry, where the

47
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,900
customer data sensitivity is often.

48
00:02:51,584 --> 00:02:54,944
It's often accompanied with
complex access requirements.

49
00:02:55,814 --> 00:02:59,954
Let's dive into machine learning
security architecture components.

50
00:03:00,374 --> 00:03:01,904
There are four building blocks to it.

51
00:03:02,084 --> 00:03:05,864
One is threat detection, where the
machine learning models identify

52
00:03:05,864 --> 00:03:09,524
enamels behavioral patterns and
potential security breaches.

53
00:03:09,944 --> 00:03:14,474
Second one is access intelligence,
adaptive authentication systems that

54
00:03:14,474 --> 00:03:17,714
adjust the security requirements
based on the risk profiles.

55
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:23,114
Data protection, which automatically
classifies the data into highly

56
00:03:23,114 --> 00:03:27,644
sensitive information and enforces
the encryption security orchestration,

57
00:03:27,644 --> 00:03:32,684
which helps us in orchestrating
security across multiple systems.

58
00:03:32,714 --> 00:03:34,334
It coordinates security response.

59
00:03:35,144 --> 00:03:38,894
These core components form the
foundation of modern machine learning,

60
00:03:38,894 --> 00:03:40,695
enhanced security architectures.

61
00:03:41,114 --> 00:03:44,954
When properly implemented, they
create a very synergistic system

62
00:03:45,284 --> 00:03:50,594
that continuously improves itself and
it adapt its defensive capabilities

63
00:03:50,894 --> 00:03:55,214
through learning while maintaining
compliance with regulatory frameworks.

64
00:03:56,024 --> 00:03:57,529
Now, let's take a look into Starbucks.

65
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:02,834
Starbucks has implemented Salesforce's
CRM security architecture.

66
00:04:03,974 --> 00:04:09,134
What are the core concepts that Starbucks
implement in their security enhancement?

67
00:04:09,464 --> 00:04:14,474
One is personalized experience, which has
advanced machine learning algorithms that

68
00:04:14,474 --> 00:04:19,664
deliver tailored customer recommendations
while enforcing robust security protocols.

69
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:24,885
Second one is behavioral monitoring,
sophisticated pattern recognition.

70
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:29,429
We'll identify and flag enamel
analyst transactions in real time.

71
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:32,429
Third one is going to be data
classification, which is com

72
00:04:32,429 --> 00:04:36,900
compartmentalization, where it
automatically categorizes the data

73
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,460
during data ingestion itself and
enforces granular access controls

74
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:43,049
and encrypts the data as well.

75
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:48,419
So this Starbucks has revolutionized
their security framework by embedding

76
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,994
advanced machine learning algorithms
within their Salesforce CRM

77
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:54,155
environment, creating a seamless fusion.

78
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,650
Of customer experiences and
also robust security measures.

79
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:02,550
This implementation demonstrates
how intelligent data processing can

80
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,990
significantly reduce any potential
attacks while maintaining performance

81
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,550
at global enterprise scale.

82
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:12,155
The breakthrough innovation
lies in their security first

83
00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:15,875
approach to personalization,
where protection mechanisms are

84
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:17,955
woven into the customer engine.

85
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,590
This inter integration ensures
that data safeguards automatically

86
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,729
scale in proportion to customer
interactions establishing a new

87
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:29,549
paradigm for secure CRM implementation.

88
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,549
Let's take a look at
the technical details.

89
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,609
There are three main components
to the security architecture

90
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:36,659
that Starbucks have implemented.

91
00:05:37,784 --> 00:05:41,684
Which is first one is Einstein's
Einstein Analytics integration, which

92
00:05:41,684 --> 00:05:43,634
is a core feature of Salesforce.

93
00:05:43,724 --> 00:05:47,715
This in this feature, there are
custom machine learning models for

94
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:51,374
correlating security events with
customer behavior patterns across

95
00:05:51,554 --> 00:05:53,150
30,000 plus locations globally.

96
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:58,965
There's real time encryption pipeline
where automatic field level encryption

97
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:04,979
is enforced based on data categorization,
and this is being processed over 87

98
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:08,955
million plus customer records while
maintaining quick response time.

99
00:06:09,764 --> 00:06:13,814
Adaptive permission framework, which
is again, the role-based access we talk

100
00:06:13,814 --> 00:06:17,264
about, we talked about as one of the core
building components of machine learning

101
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:22,694
architecture, the context of our access
controls, adjust the employee data access

102
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:28,124
based on behavioral baselines that are
set up by the company and ly detection

103
00:06:28,335 --> 00:06:31,030
across two 50,000 plus user accounts.

104
00:06:31,815 --> 00:06:35,205
The technical implementation
leverages Salesforce shield with

105
00:06:35,205 --> 00:06:38,955
some customer extensions, creating
a security fabric that doesn't

106
00:06:38,955 --> 00:06:41,114
compromise the customer experience.

107
00:06:41,655 --> 00:06:45,945
This approach determines that security
and functionality can be complementary

108
00:06:46,215 --> 00:06:48,314
rather than competing priorities.

109
00:06:49,364 --> 00:06:52,900
Let's move on to Capital
One, AWS breach analysis.

110
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,900
So the backstory of it in
short would be there is a mis

111
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,030
misconfigured web application
firewall inside AWS environment.

112
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,120
The attacker was able to use
SSRF vulnerability to access

113
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,390
the metadata service, which is
server site forgery request.

114
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,090
How was the attacker able to use it?

115
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,890
The attacker was able to gain access
to IAM credential access temporarily,

116
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,600
which has access permission.

117
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:27,284
And was successfully able to data
exfiltrate a hundred million plus

118
00:07:27,284 --> 00:07:29,354
customer records without detection.

119
00:07:29,685 --> 00:07:35,414
So this 2019 Capital One breach serves as
a critical case study in cloud security

120
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:40,335
failures analysis reveals that machine
learning could have prevented this.

121
00:07:41,505 --> 00:07:44,685
Let's do dive into how it
could have been implemented.

122
00:07:45,315 --> 00:07:47,474
The first component that
comes into picture for machine

123
00:07:47,474 --> 00:07:48,870
learning is behavioral analysis.

124
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,729
So the machine learning would
detect abnormal IAM credential usage

125
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:56,909
patterns, misconfiguration scanning.

126
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:02,649
So whenever there is any insecure
configuration or invalid configuration

127
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:06,939
built machine learning can automatically
scan the system based on the

128
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:11,379
regulatory checks that we enforce,
and it automatically identifies any

129
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:17,529
insecure wire firewall settings, access
intelligence, role-based access control.

130
00:08:18,294 --> 00:08:23,034
It evaluates the access based on
the context for resource request.

131
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:23,334
Right?

132
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:26,754
Modern Machine Learning security
solutions could have prevented the

133
00:08:26,754 --> 00:08:30,774
speech through the about three,
which is continuous monitoring of

134
00:08:30,774 --> 00:08:35,125
credential usage patterns, automatic
detection of configuration, drift,

135
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,415
and alerting the system that there is.

136
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:41,845
Of Misconfigured Firewall by applying
zero trust principles in role-based

137
00:08:41,845 --> 00:08:45,295
access controls which is enhanced
with machine learning decision making.

138
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:49,074
The system would have required
additional verification for unusual

139
00:08:49,074 --> 00:08:54,055
access patterns, which potentially
blocks the attack before data exposure.

140
00:08:55,629 --> 00:09:00,025
Now let's dive into Mayo Clinic
Healthcare Machine Learning security.

141
00:09:00,864 --> 00:09:04,314
The three main components that Mayo
Clinic uses in machine learning

142
00:09:04,314 --> 00:09:06,775
security are data classification.

143
00:09:07,134 --> 00:09:11,935
So there is machine learning powered
automatic data classification of

144
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:17,634
protected health information with 99.3%
accuracy across 23 million patient

145
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:21,834
records ensuring appropriate security
controls are applied contextually.

146
00:09:23,724 --> 00:09:28,854
Advanced role-based access control
intelligence, the predictive analysis,

147
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:33,805
the predictive access patterns analysis
that identifies potential unauthorized

148
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:39,084
access attempt before they occur with
87% reduction in false positives compared

149
00:09:39,084 --> 00:09:41,574
to traditional rule-based systems.

150
00:09:42,204 --> 00:09:46,104
Automated compliance monitor, which
is scanning the system continuously

151
00:09:46,104 --> 00:09:49,615
for HIPAA compliance verification,
using machine learning models,

152
00:09:49,615 --> 00:09:51,415
trained on proper audit findings.

153
00:09:52,045 --> 00:09:56,994
Maintaining compliance while processing
8.4 TB of daily healthcare data.

154
00:09:57,594 --> 00:10:02,514
This implementation is in Microsoft Cloud
for healthcare, and this demonstrates

155
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:07,254
how machine learning transforms static
security controls into dynamic learning

156
00:10:07,254 --> 00:10:13,239
systems that adapt to complex workflows of
healthcare industry without compromising.

157
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,310
The compliance requirements.

158
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:19,869
Let's dive into the Mayo Clinic's
machine learning security architecture.

159
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:23,589
The first one would be data
ingestion, which is categorizing the

160
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,199
data automatically while intaking.

161
00:10:26,604 --> 00:10:32,094
Okay with classification and
encryption enforced unclassified data.

162
00:10:32,694 --> 00:10:35,935
The second component would be machine
learning process, where all the

163
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:40,795
behavioral and access pattern analysis
and anomaly detection happens.

164
00:10:41,305 --> 00:10:44,334
Third component is compliance
verification, which is scanning

165
00:10:44,334 --> 00:10:47,874
the system continuously with our
automated regulatory checks and

166
00:10:47,874 --> 00:10:49,884
validations that we put in place.

167
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:54,175
Fourth one would be contextual access,
which is switching the permissions

168
00:10:54,175 --> 00:11:00,385
dynamically based on context or role of
whoever is trying to access the resources.

169
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:04,464
Mayo Clinic's architecture creates
a continuous learning system

170
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:08,124
that enhances protection while
streamlining clinical workflows.

171
00:11:08,244 --> 00:11:14,364
Their machine learning models evolved
from 76% accuracy to over 98% through

172
00:11:14,364 --> 00:11:19,224
operational feedback loops, demonstrating
how healthcare organizations can leverage

173
00:11:19,224 --> 00:11:24,469
AI to improve security posture while
meeting specialized industry requirements.

174
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:27,954
Let's dive into our last use case.

175
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:31,374
JP Morgan Chase, multi-cloud
machine learning security.

176
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:39,244
So JP Morgan Chase has used different
clouds to for different security aspects.

177
00:11:39,604 --> 00:11:45,124
They've used AWS for AWS security, which
has machine learning powered ly detection

178
00:11:45,124 --> 00:11:49,114
engine for transaction processing and
database access, which is handling

179
00:11:49,114 --> 00:11:51,394
over 5 trillion daily data points.

180
00:11:52,204 --> 00:11:56,944
Second one would be GCP Google
Cloud Platform, which has AI model

181
00:11:56,944 --> 00:12:00,844
training environment with specialized
container security and federated

182
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:03,094
learning across jurisdictions.

183
00:12:03,604 --> 00:12:07,714
Third one is Microsoft Azure, which
takes care of customer facing services

184
00:12:07,714 --> 00:12:12,069
with adaptive authentication and real
time threat intelligence integration.

185
00:12:13,354 --> 00:12:17,104
This multi-cloud strategy represents
the cutting edge of machine learning

186
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:19,234
powered security orchestration.

187
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:24,334
Their implementation creates a
unified security fabric across

188
00:12:24,515 --> 00:12:29,555
A-W-S-G-C-P and Azure while maintaining
consistent policy enforcement through

189
00:12:29,555 --> 00:12:31,084
machine learning governance models.

190
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:36,005
This approach enables them to leverage
the strengths of each cloud provider

191
00:12:36,305 --> 00:12:41,135
while maintaining a coherent security
posture that meets stringent requirements

192
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,295
of financial services regulation.

193
00:12:45,035 --> 00:12:49,025
The advantage that they have seen
with this cross cloud machine learning

194
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:54,964
security architecture, which 99.7% fraud
detection, so the accuracy of machine

195
00:12:54,964 --> 00:13:00,755
learning driven transaction system
processing over $7.4 trillion annually.

196
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:06,680
They have 5,000 plus security
models deployed using machine

197
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,060
learning algorithms across clouds
for specific security functions.

198
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:18,890
89% incident reduction, decrease
in security incidents following

199
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,750
machine learning implementation.

200
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,895
The average time for
any identified threats.

201
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,709
Is three minutes, which is very quick.

202
00:13:28,249 --> 00:13:33,020
JP Morgan's approach demonstrates how
enterprises can create a coherent security

203
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,020
strategy across multi-cloud platforms.

204
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:39,770
Their central machine learning
orchestration platforms normalizes

205
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:43,699
security telemetry from different
providers, enabling comprehensive

206
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,640
threat detection regardless of
where the workloads are deployed.

207
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,510
For any implementation of
machine learning, enhanced

208
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,069
security, there are four.

209
00:13:52,939 --> 00:13:55,310
Building blocks that we
will have to start with.

210
00:13:55,969 --> 00:14:00,019
The first one is security assessment,
connecting a comprehensive evaluation

211
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:04,489
of existing security controls,
identifying gaps and opportunities

212
00:14:04,489 --> 00:14:06,139
for machine learning enhancement.

213
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:10,219
We'll have to map the current data
flows to understand where machine

214
00:14:10,219 --> 00:14:13,785
learning can provide the highest
security value if we plug it in.

215
00:14:14,704 --> 00:14:18,334
Then we start with developing the
models, which is building and training

216
00:14:18,334 --> 00:14:22,055
the machine learning models for
specific security functions like anomaly

217
00:14:22,055 --> 00:14:27,425
detection, role-based access controls,
compliance monitoring, scanning the

218
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:31,715
system, establishing the baseline
for all of the behavioral profiles

219
00:14:31,715 --> 00:14:33,334
and validation methodologies Also.

220
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,579
Come under Model Development
integration architecture.

221
00:14:37,729 --> 00:14:41,449
Now comes designing the technical
architecture for integrating this

222
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:45,859
machine learning security components with
existing cloud infrastructure, ensuring

223
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:50,275
appropriate data access is given and
the processing capabilities are granted.

224
00:14:51,485 --> 00:14:55,564
Last one would be governance framework,
where you'll be establishing an

225
00:14:55,564 --> 00:15:00,125
oversight process for machine learning
security models, including guardrails,

226
00:15:00,305 --> 00:15:04,324
performance monitoring, bias detection,
continuous improvement methodologies.

227
00:15:04,775 --> 00:15:07,745
So this framework provides a
structured approach to implementing

228
00:15:07,745 --> 00:15:12,515
machine learning within your security
architecture, focusing on high value

229
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:16,954
use cases while maintaining appropriate
governance and compliance awareness.

230
00:15:18,349 --> 00:15:20,660
So what are the key takeaways
and next steps for us?

231
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,160
Machine learning fundamentally transforms
cloud security from static rules to

232
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:31,219
adaptive reactive to proactive intelligent
systems that continuously improve secure

233
00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:35,300
successful implementations like Starbucks,
may clinic demonstrate that security

234
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:38,660
and functionality can be complimentary
rather than competing priorities.

235
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:43,385
As you begin your implementation
journey, focus on identifying high

236
00:15:43,385 --> 00:15:48,155
value use cases where machine learning
can plug in and address specific

237
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,464
security challenges in your environment.

238
00:15:50,915 --> 00:15:52,954
Start with well-defined problems.

239
00:15:53,015 --> 00:15:57,035
Establish clear success metrics,
build towards a comprehensive

240
00:15:57,035 --> 00:16:00,724
machine learning security framework
through iterative improvement.

241
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:02,555
Thank you.
