00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,110
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,550
My name is Rinku Mohan.

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:08,010
Today we are going to discuss a topic that
is increasingly significant in our rapidly

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,690
changing world, the importance of digital
inclusion for the aging population.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,860
This is closely related to my
research on the digital exclusion

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,450
of elderly inclusions, where we
explore the challenges they face and

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,965
the solutions needed to ensure no
one is left behind the digital age.

8
00:00:26,465 --> 00:00:31,174
As life expectancy continues to rise
around the world, the issue of aging

9
00:00:31,174 --> 00:00:33,095
has become more and more significant.

10
00:00:33,485 --> 00:00:36,545
This change brings both
opportunities and challenges.

11
00:00:37,145 --> 00:00:40,565
The technology advancements have
the power to transform lives,

12
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:44,644
offering better living conditions and
opportunities to connect socially.

13
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:48,935
However, for many elderly
individuals, navigating modern

14
00:00:48,935 --> 00:00:50,675
technologies can be a real challenge.

15
00:00:51,515 --> 00:00:55,565
The digital inclusion is crucial
here by ensuring that everyone,

16
00:00:55,864 --> 00:01:00,035
regardless of their age, has access
to and can use digital tools.

17
00:01:00,065 --> 00:01:00,815
Effectivity.

18
00:01:01,385 --> 00:01:04,444
We can promote social justice
and equal development.

19
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:08,554
It helps bridge gaps, foster
connections, and improve the

20
00:01:08,554 --> 00:01:10,355
overall quality of the life of the.

21
00:01:10,855 --> 00:01:14,065
This research mainly focuses
on the understanding of the

22
00:01:14,065 --> 00:01:16,075
digital divide among the elderly.

23
00:01:16,465 --> 00:01:20,395
We wanted to find out what causing
all the others to struggle with

24
00:01:20,395 --> 00:01:25,085
technology, how their how this impact
their lives, and why these challenges

25
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,645
differ from one country to another.

26
00:01:27,365 --> 00:01:31,655
So the ultimate goal is to figure
out ways to help them integrate

27
00:01:31,655 --> 00:01:33,455
better into today's digital world.

28
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,800
And we explored three main questions.

29
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,110
What is the current situation
of the digital exclusion?

30
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,610
How well are the older people able
to use devices like smartphones,

31
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,890
computers, and other digital tools?

32
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,510
Secondly, what are the key
reasons behind this difficulties?

33
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,620
How do things like their income,
health or age affect their

34
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,420
ability to use technology?

35
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,020
And how does this impact
their everyday lives?

36
00:02:01,785 --> 00:02:06,195
And finally, how do these issues
vary between different countries?

37
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:10,334
Are all the peoples in wealthier
countries facing the same struggles

38
00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:12,675
as those in the less wealthy ones?

39
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:17,235
And by answering these questions, we
hope to provide practical insights

40
00:02:17,235 --> 00:02:21,735
that can guide policies, programs,
and community efforts to make the

41
00:02:21,735 --> 00:02:26,175
digital world more accessible for
elderly, no matter where they live.

42
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,420
Here is something interesting from
the general knowledge about older

43
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,219
age groups and their internet use.

44
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,870
As people get older, their
internet usage drops significantly.

45
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:44,279
For example, in age groups like 45 to
54, 55 to 64 and 65, plus the number of

46
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:48,269
internet users is about 10 percentage
less compared to younger groups.

47
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:51,810
This trend highlights how
technology adoption becomes

48
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,399
more of a challenge with age.

49
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,499
Another point to note is the oldest
dependency ratio the number of older

50
00:02:58,499 --> 00:03:03,399
people compared to the working age
population in most countries except India.

51
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:05,200
This ratio is above 50.

52
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:10,279
This means that there are at
least 50 older adults for every

53
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:15,919
a hundred working a stupid For
India, it's slightly lower at 37.

54
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:17,719
Looking ahead.

55
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:23,329
It is projected that by 2075, more
than half the population in these

56
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,129
countries will be senior citizens.

57
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,409
This means that addressing the
digital divide and preparing for

58
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:33,159
an aging population will become
more important in the future.

59
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:38,549
For our research, we collected aging
data from five high income countries and

60
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:40,589
five lower and middle income countries.

61
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,839
The higher income countries include
United Kingdom Germany, Austria,

62
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:50,639
France, Estonia, and the lower and
middle income countries included India,

63
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,354
Mexico, Brazil, Bulgaria, and Romania.

64
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:57,944
We selected these countries to
ensure a diverse representation

65
00:03:57,944 --> 00:04:00,164
of economic and cultural context.

66
00:04:00,734 --> 00:04:05,474
By comparing digital exclusion across
these regions, we were able to see

67
00:04:05,804 --> 00:04:10,094
how challenges differ between the
wealthier and less wealthy countries

68
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:15,319
and gain deeper insights into the
factors driving the digital divide.

69
00:04:15,884 --> 00:04:20,174
And we looked at the data from
these sources over five years,

70
00:04:20,174 --> 00:04:26,144
from 2019 to 2023 to ensure we
capture trends and changes over.

71
00:04:26,644 --> 00:04:31,204
Once we had the data, we analyzed it
using various statistical methods.

72
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:35,674
For example, principle component
analysis, which help us to understand

73
00:04:35,674 --> 00:04:40,104
the key factors driving the digital
exclusion and the test like five

74
00:04:40,104 --> 00:04:44,905
square and anova, which help us to find
the patterns compared groups and see

75
00:04:45,354 --> 00:04:49,465
how digital exclusion varies between
countries, income levels, and age.

76
00:04:49,965 --> 00:04:55,124
This combination of methods allowed us to
identify the main barriers older adults

77
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:59,684
face when using technology and how these
challenges differ across the regions.

78
00:05:00,494 --> 00:05:04,905
This table Compass five higher income
countries, Austria, Germany, France,

79
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:11,234
Estonia, and uk focusing on population
size, age, gender, and digital exclusion.

80
00:05:11,755 --> 00:05:15,805
The United Kingdom stands out with
the largest group of participants

81
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:20,525
while Austria has the smallest in
terms of age, the median across all

82
00:05:20,525 --> 00:05:25,055
countries is the early seventies,
but UK has a slightly younger

83
00:05:25,055 --> 00:05:27,066
population with a median age of 69.

84
00:05:27,934 --> 00:05:31,715
Gender wise, women are more
represented in every country.

85
00:05:32,074 --> 00:05:36,694
Estonia, for example, has the
highest proportion of women now

86
00:05:36,694 --> 00:05:38,674
when it comes to digital exclusion.

87
00:05:38,974 --> 00:05:44,074
Estonia and France has the
highest rate around 30 percentage.

88
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:49,340
While UK is doing much better with only
11 percentage of the population excluded.

89
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,409
When we look at the age, the median
across middle income countries

90
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:58,030
ranges from 64 to 70 years with
bacteria have the oldest group.

91
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,159
The 55 to 64 group is the largest
in most countries, especially in

92
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:07,449
India and Mexico, where it accounts
for nearly half the population.

93
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:12,789
On the other hand, the 75 plus age
group is much smaller, particularly

94
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:17,049
in India and Mexico, where it's
around 16 to 17 percentage.

95
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:21,894
For gender, there is a fairly balanced
split in most countries, though bras,

96
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:27,624
Brazil has a slightly higher proportion
of men at 55 percentage, while India

97
00:06:27,624 --> 00:06:32,924
and Mexico have more women at around
53 percentage, the most striking

98
00:06:33,554 --> 00:06:35,684
insight is digital exclusion in media.

99
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:40,299
Which has the highest rate within
staggering 91 percentage of the

100
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:45,129
population display excluded highlighting
a major challenge for connectivity.

101
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,869
In contrast Mexico has the lowest
exclusion rate at 33 percentage showing

102
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,029
significant progress in digital access.

103
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:58,204
Age and marital status are two key factors
when it comes to digital exclusion.

104
00:06:58,654 --> 00:06:59,794
Let's start with age.

105
00:07:00,214 --> 00:07:04,864
Older age groups are significantly
more likely to be digitally excluded,

106
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:09,844
and this issue is even more pronounced
in lower and middle income countries.

107
00:07:10,474 --> 00:07:14,914
In contrast, higher income countries
tend to do a better job for including

108
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:17,374
older populations in digital world.

109
00:07:17,874 --> 00:07:20,094
Now let's talk about merit status.

110
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:24,714
Individuals without partners, whether
single, divorced or widow without

111
00:07:25,134 --> 00:07:27,684
are more likely to be excluded.

112
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:32,214
This 10 is noticeable in all
countries, but the gap is much

113
00:07:32,214 --> 00:07:34,374
wider in middle income countries.

114
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:37,379
So what does this mean overall?

115
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:42,449
The most digitally excluded demographics
are older adults and individuals

116
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:47,699
without partners, and this is especially
severe in middle income countries.

117
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:52,079
These findings highlight the
origin need for targeted efforts

118
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,699
to close this digital divide.

119
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:57,989
The factors affecting digital
exclusion was identified using.

120
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:02,674
A factor analysis which is a
dimensional reduction technique used

121
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:05,134
to identify the most important factors.

122
00:08:05,674 --> 00:08:11,264
And it suggests that three different
factors are primarily causing digital

123
00:08:11,264 --> 00:08:16,145
exclusion among elderly, and among which
socioeconomic factors highlight that

124
00:08:16,354 --> 00:08:21,694
the difference in country type education
and math status are key socioeconomic

125
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:23,914
drivers of digital exclusion.

126
00:08:24,454 --> 00:08:28,655
And the policy interventions
targeting education and mal support

127
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:31,054
can help bridge the digital gap.

128
00:08:31,714 --> 00:08:36,725
And the component two, which is health
related issues, stress that the physical

129
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:41,105
and health conditions are significant
barriers to digital inclusion.

130
00:08:41,794 --> 00:08:45,810
And it suggests that the healthcare
support systems that integrate

131
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,340
digital literacy programs are
necessary to bridge this gap.

132
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:56,535
And the component three, which is age
related limitations, emphasize the role of

133
00:08:56,535 --> 00:09:02,865
age and physical limitations in excluding
individuals from the digital space, and

134
00:09:02,865 --> 00:09:08,145
it recommend age friendly technologies
and accessibility enhancements.

135
00:09:08,775 --> 00:09:12,945
Variations of digital exclusion
between higher income and middle income

136
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:18,705
countries were identified by square
test, and the result indicate that

137
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:22,765
there is a strong association between
country type and digital exclusion.

138
00:09:23,365 --> 00:09:27,535
This suggests that digital exclusion
is not evenly distributed across

139
00:09:27,535 --> 00:09:32,005
countries and is strongly influenced
by their economy classification.

140
00:09:32,665 --> 00:09:36,775
Higher income countries have better
digital inclusion due to advanced

141
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:40,735
infrastructure, affordability and
widespread of digital literacy.

142
00:09:41,235 --> 00:09:46,335
The middle income countries face greater
challenges included, including limited

143
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:51,675
access to technology, poor infrastructure
and affordability values, which

144
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,955
amplify the digital exclusion rates.

145
00:09:54,735 --> 00:09:58,275
This slide presents the result
of a I square test used to in

146
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:02,145
investigate the relationship
between age groups of different.

147
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:07,175
It explores whether the age group
significantly impacts digital inclusion

148
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:11,045
or exclusion depending on the economy
classification of the country.

149
00:10:11,615 --> 00:10:16,055
The highly significant Kai Square
result confirms that age groups are

150
00:10:16,055 --> 00:10:20,715
associated with digital exclusion,
and this association varies across

151
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:22,330
higher and middle income countries.

152
00:10:23,115 --> 00:10:27,735
The older age groups in middle income
countries are likely more affected

153
00:10:27,735 --> 00:10:32,685
by digital exclusion compared to
en age groups or their counterparts

154
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:34,185
in higher income countries.

155
00:10:34,615 --> 00:10:39,865
This could be due to lack of access
to digital technologies, lower digital

156
00:10:39,865 --> 00:10:44,665
literacy among older operations,
or infrastructure and affordability

157
00:10:44,665 --> 00:10:46,675
challenges in middle income countries.

158
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:51,300
The ANO test was used to find the
variation in the life satisfaction

159
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,360
among digitally secured people
in higher income countries.

160
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,640
And result suggests that there is a
significant difference in the variation

161
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,740
of means across different countries.

162
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:09,220
And the Austria has reported the higher
rate for the displaced credit people, and

163
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,710
the Estonia has got the lowest rating.

164
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,440
Similarly while comparing the variation
in the life satisfaction among the

165
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:22,470
digitally excluded people in middle
income countries, the Romania has got

166
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:29,010
the highest rate, while the India has got
the lowest rate for life satisfaction.

167
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:34,880
To investigate the impact of digital
exclusion and its interaction with country

168
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:40,700
in terms of health rating, the two way
an test was performed, and we can see

169
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:47,570
that the digitally included people in all
other countries, except Mexico is showing

170
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,010
higher rating for health while comparing
to the digitally excluded people.

171
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,560
Final thought.

172
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,510
The digital exclusion has many impacts,
like it reduces access to essential

173
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,970
services, social connections, and banking.

174
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,020
Also, it affects quality of life of.

175
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,190
The key findings include there are
significant disparity in the digital

176
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,420
exclusion rate between higher income
countries and middle income countries

177
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:20,560
where UK is having only 11 percentage
and is having 91 percentage of people are

178
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:25,320
digitally excluded, and the socioeconomic
age related and health related

179
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,060
challenges are found to be the primary
con contributors of digital exclusion.

180
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,570
And the successful programs like
Austria's, digital Seniors, and India's

181
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:41,630
Age digital literacy programs show
promise, but it require expansion and

182
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:46,625
tailored programs for rural areas and
underserved demographics are also crucial.

183
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:51,895
The recommendations include expand
digital literacy programs to remote

184
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:57,945
areas and include affordable devices
and internet access, and focus on most

185
00:12:58,035 --> 00:13:04,065
excluded groups like 75 plus in higher
income countries, and anger and early

186
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:05,895
groups, inter middle income countries.

187
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,430
Also encourage community based activities
and public private collaborations

188
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,620
to promote technology adoption.

189
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:20,110
The future research should look into the
cultural and healthcare related aspects

190
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:25,900
of the digital exclusion and conduct
longitudal studies to track progress and

191
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,765
effectiveness of these interventions.

192
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:34,075
Collaborative efforts, policy makers and
organizations are essential to bridge the

193
00:13:34,075 --> 00:13:35,845
digital divide and support the elderly.

194
00:13:36,345 --> 00:13:38,355
