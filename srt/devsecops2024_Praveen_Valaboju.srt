00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,920
Welcome to COM 42 DevSecOps 2024.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,180
This is Praveen Kumar Vallabhoju.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,090
I'm a Landovering.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,710
And in this session, I'll be talking
about integrating cloud technologies

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,509
for enhanced healthcare system.

6
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:15,849
A comprehensive approach to
revolutionizing healthcare

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,160
efficiency and patient care.

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,280
Whenever I say cloud technologies, I
like to give some examples like AWS,

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,940
Azure, Google Cloud, and Autoclick Cloud.

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,910
I'll start with my table of content.

11
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,750
It has introduction, challenges in
healthcare, proposed solutions, AI seed

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,980
automation, Kubernetes for scalability,
containment with documentum, neural

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,620
network for AI driven insight, innovate
platform benefit, finally, conclusion.

14
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:43,589
Introduction, the need for digital
transformation in healthcare,

15
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:47,239
why now healthcare is facing
unprecedented challenges in

16
00:00:47,249 --> 00:00:48,669
managing massive data volume.

17
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:54,560
The need for timely care and compliance
with evolving regulation is growing.

18
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:55,530
Solution.

19
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,140
Cloud technologies address these
challenges by enabling secure,

20
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,130
scalable, and efficient system.

21
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:02,109
Key insight.

22
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,120
A unified cloud platform can bridge
the gap between technological

23
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,570
limitation and healthcare demand.

24
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,140
Challenge in healthcare.

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,030
Current challenges in healthcare system.

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,120
Key challenges.

27
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,100
Data overload.

28
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,600
Lack of structure.

29
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:18,265
System for storing and
retrieving patient information.

30
00:01:18,435 --> 00:01:19,135
System downtime.

31
00:01:19,565 --> 00:01:23,064
Even a few minutes of system
downtime can jeopardize patient care.

32
00:01:23,614 --> 00:01:24,694
Regulatory compliance.

33
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:29,035
Keeping up with HIPAA and other
global healthcare standards

34
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:31,155
is resource intensive.

35
00:01:31,644 --> 00:01:33,644
Workflow inefficiency.

36
00:01:33,725 --> 00:01:38,655
Manual process increases errors
and delay critical decision impact.

37
00:01:38,675 --> 00:01:43,205
Without modernizing these challenges
will escalate as healthcare demand rises.

38
00:01:43,705 --> 00:01:46,145
Proposal solution integrating
advanced cloud technologies.

39
00:01:47,135 --> 00:01:50,345
CACD automation reduces
manual intervention and

40
00:01:50,345 --> 00:01:52,015
ensures seamless deployment.

41
00:01:52,035 --> 00:01:56,585
Whenever I say CACD, it's like
tools like GitHub and GitLab.

42
00:01:57,505 --> 00:02:02,724
And Kubernetes handles dynamic
scaling to meet fluctuating demands.

43
00:02:03,214 --> 00:02:08,495
So when I say Kubernetes, it's
like EKS, AKS, and other Kubernetes

44
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,094
platforms available in the market.

45
00:02:10,094 --> 00:02:10,734
very much.

46
00:02:11,144 --> 00:02:15,165
organizes structured and
unstructured medical data efficiency.

47
00:02:15,195 --> 00:02:18,314
in other words, a documentum is an open
text product available in the market.

48
00:02:18,344 --> 00:02:19,734
It's enterprise level management.

49
00:02:20,314 --> 00:02:26,105
Neural network drives insights for
diagnostic, imaging, and decision

50
00:02:26,114 --> 00:02:30,725
making, which can be achieved using
Python libraries like TensorFlow.

51
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:34,545
And other neural network
libraries like Keras.

52
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:37,674
Those libraries can help in
making the neural network work.

53
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:38,725
Outcome.

54
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:42,805
A unified platform that lowers
costs, ensures compliance,

55
00:02:42,874 --> 00:02:44,555
and improves patient outcomes.

56
00:02:44,555 --> 00:02:46,954
CSED.

57
00:02:46,954 --> 00:02:49,554
Automation automating healthcare
application deployment.

58
00:02:49,555 --> 00:02:50,625
Why does CSED matter?

59
00:02:51,365 --> 00:02:56,874
Fast, reliable updates are crucial for
mission critical healthcare applications.

60
00:02:56,995 --> 00:02:58,704
Automation reduces human errors.

61
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,540
and ensure constant deployment.

62
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,499
So when I say CRCD, it's like
a code commit, manual testing.

63
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:09,919
All these things can be automated in
the CRCD platform so that, deliverable

64
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,890
will be faster and reliable and secure.

65
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,989
And, with the key benefit, 30 percent
priority gain, teams can focus on

66
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:20,879
inline automation instead of manual
deployment, faster responses,

67
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,919
bug fixes, and feature updates,
rollouts, in hours instead of days.

68
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:25,179
Thank you.

69
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:29,459
Kubernetes for Scalability Dynamic
Resource Management Kubernetes How

70
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,279
Kubernetes helps Automatically scales
resources based upon their real time

71
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:38,429
demand Ensure critical systems remain
operational even during peak usage.

72
00:03:38,429 --> 00:03:43,679
So it's like you have a hospital
website and it might be need like

73
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:45,489
more resources during the peak time.

74
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:50,509
Kubernetes will help in making autoscale
and which brings up the based upon the

75
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,799
traffic and CPU configuration we can
bring up the application to support with

76
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:59,569
the more parts and when there is low
traffic and low usage and based upon the

77
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:02,999
CPU you can bring down the parts usage.

78
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:05,149
So with this we can reduce the.

79
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,509
resource, management, which is equal
to a benefit, like 40 percent cost

80
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:13,409
reduction only uses resources when
needed, optimizing cloud expenses.

81
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:17,629
And it supports zero downtime
reliable service for the healthcare

82
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:18,879
professional and patients.

83
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,189
which means if we have a new feature,
we can just bring up the new feature.

84
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:25,699
Like we thought bringing up with the
current application going down totally.

85
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:28,159
We can just bring it up, do
the blueprint deployment.

86
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:32,769
which means we can just bring up the
newly featured application up and

87
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:37,069
just bring down the old feature down
using the pod reduction and bring up

88
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,879
the new feature up with more pods.

89
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:42,589
which means We can achieve the zero
downtime and without a patient even or

90
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:46,659
persons who are using this application may
not even know there is an application went

91
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:48,689
down for the significant amount of time.

92
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:53,559
Example, a hospital can scale
its systems during health crisis

93
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,719
without overhauling infrastructure.

94
00:04:56,219 --> 00:04:57,459
Content management with Documentum.

95
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,219
Managing healthcare with Documentum.

96
00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:02,069
One Documentum solves.

97
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:03,329
Organizers.

98
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:09,114
Structured and unstructured data
allows secure and quick access

99
00:05:09,384 --> 00:05:11,344
to critical patient record.

100
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:16,274
So when I say organized structure
like lab results, we can just store

101
00:05:16,304 --> 00:05:21,804
these lab results and document them
using metadata and all other fields.

102
00:05:22,244 --> 00:05:28,094
And whenever we enter this data and
which is finally helpful for us to

103
00:05:28,104 --> 00:05:32,554
return the document quicker than the
normal process of finding the document.

104
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:37,364
So with these, the benefit includes
like HIPAA compliance document handling

105
00:05:37,414 --> 00:05:42,124
ensures data security since it is stored
in the enterprise content management.

106
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:46,144
So content management is designed for the
providing the security of the document.

107
00:05:46,234 --> 00:05:48,784
So it provides the, as for
the complexity, provide the

108
00:05:49,644 --> 00:05:51,594
security standard and efficiency.

109
00:05:51,924 --> 00:05:57,744
Since we have the metadata on this
document, we can, it is, helps like

110
00:05:57,804 --> 00:06:00,994
finding the document very faster
as compared to The normal process.

111
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:07,214
And with this example, document reduces
patient record retrieval times by up to

112
00:06:07,214 --> 00:06:10,024
60 percent enabling quicker diagnosis.

113
00:06:10,524 --> 00:06:12,234
Neural network for AI driven.

114
00:06:12,794 --> 00:06:15,524
So transforming healthcare
with neural network.

115
00:06:15,634 --> 00:06:16,894
Applications in healthcare.

116
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:22,124
Medical images detect anomalies in x
ray and MRI with a human level accuracy.

117
00:06:22,624 --> 00:06:24,684
Predictive analysis
identify potential outcome.

118
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:26,284
Complications early.

119
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:27,844
Personalized treatment.

120
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:31,574
Suggest treatment plan
tailored to individual patient.

121
00:06:31,634 --> 00:06:32,164
Impact.

122
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:37,654
Reduces diagnostic errors and support
evidence based decision making.

123
00:06:38,594 --> 00:06:43,164
Surpasses human performance like
tasks like detecting cancer itself.

124
00:06:43,214 --> 00:06:44,734
I just want to give some example.

125
00:06:45,324 --> 00:06:47,414
So basically where we use neural network.

126
00:06:47,444 --> 00:06:50,009
So example of patient A
goes to the patient B.

127
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:55,999
perform the CT scan and it may be any
way, it is due to, it may be due to

128
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:01,869
the device malfunction or the person
who is operating who need more, higher

129
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,969
accuracy of the image due to the
chance, high chance of, exposing the

130
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:07,669
radiation to the particular patient.

131
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:13,134
So with this neural network, we can
easily, you know, detect, is the person

132
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:17,574
exposed to higher radiation and, if it is
go, if it goes for the higher radiation,

133
00:07:18,024 --> 00:07:25,094
we can start working on the, treatment
before it makes go to the cancerous cell.

134
00:07:25,594 --> 00:07:29,274
With this slide, I'd like to give
the benefit of this platform, unified

135
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:30,424
cloud platform for healthcare.

136
00:07:30,924 --> 00:07:36,614
Integrating solutions like CI, CD,
Kubernetes, Documentum, and AI for

137
00:07:36,614 --> 00:07:40,434
seamless operation benefits workflow
automation eliminates redundancies and

138
00:07:40,854 --> 00:07:45,194
improves collaboration, cost reduction,
pooling resources, lower operational

139
00:07:45,504 --> 00:07:51,564
expenses, patient outcome, faster,
more accurate diagnosis and treatment,

140
00:07:52,084 --> 00:07:56,814
scalable and feature ready, easily adopts
new technologies and growing demand.

141
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,539
example, hospital adapting unified
cloud platform reported 25 percent

142
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:04,659
improvement in patient care efficiency.

143
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:05,809
Conclusion.

144
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,819
The integration of advanced
cloud technologies into health

145
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,500
care system is non step.

146
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,130
It's not just a technological shift, but
a transformative approach to addressing

147
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,600
critical challenges in the industry.

148

By leveraging CI SEED Automation,
Kubernetes Documentum, and neural network,

149
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:27,940
SDK organizations can create a unified,
scalable, and intelligent infrastructure.

150
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,600
This integration optimized workflow
ensures compliance with stringent

151
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,510
regulations, reduces operational
costs, and most importantly,

152
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,040
improves patient care outcomes.

153
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:46,210
The unified platform fosters collaboration
among healthcare professionals, enhances

154
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:53,040
diagnostic accuracy, and enables timely
treatment, laying the foundation for a

155
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:59,150
data driven, patient centric healthcare
system as the healthcare landscape

156
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:05,160
continues to evolve with trends like
precision medicine and remote monitoring.

157
00:09:06,105 --> 00:09:10,015
This integrated approach
provides the adaptability and

158
00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:13,945
scalability needed to incorporate
emerging technology seamlessly.

159
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:18,405
So with this, I would like to thank
everyone who gave this opportunity to
