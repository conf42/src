1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,550
Speaker 5: Hello people.

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,750
My name is Avi Vinta.

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,260
I am very happy to speak to you
about the AI driven vectorized

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,620
motor health monitoring for any
industry for industrial applications.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,490
And I would firstly like to thank
the conference 42 for giving me

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,049
this opportunity to speak with
you all, a little about myself.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,419
My name is Avi.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,230
I go by Avi Nasta.

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:28,959
I am currently a principal at MongoDB,
where I manage strategic relations

10
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:35,329
and partnerships with the SI ecosystem
pertaining to the IOT and the ai.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,100
Industry.

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,839
I have close to 20 plus
years of experience now.

13
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:46,080
I have graduated as an electrical
engineer from my bachelor standpoint

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,450
and did my master's in mechanical.

15
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,690
By the virtue of that, I'm an
electro mechanical engineer.

16
00:00:51,835 --> 00:00:57,245
And I'm happy to speak to you guys
about my passionate subject, which

17
00:00:57,245 --> 00:01:02,195
is the motor industry, the electrical
machines, and the reliability around them.

18
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:07,365
Let's go back, I think, jumped
up, slide let's understand what

19
00:01:07,414 --> 00:01:08,794
we are gonna speak today about.

20
00:01:09,464 --> 00:01:14,064
If you really look upon the motors motors
have existed for several decades now.

21
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:18,889
The very virtue of a motor runs
on a principle where, you have

22
00:01:18,889 --> 00:01:21,979
an electrical field and you put a
magnet in that electrical field.

23
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:26,769
There is motion or kinetic motion
developed by the magnet in there.

24
00:01:27,664 --> 00:01:31,154
Now when you look into this this
this particular technique, there

25
00:01:31,154 --> 00:01:32,594
is no rocket science there.

26
00:01:32,594 --> 00:01:37,524
It has been well established and
proven but the nature of a motor has

27
00:01:37,585 --> 00:01:40,025
been an integral part for all of us.

28
00:01:40,455 --> 00:01:43,850
The way we clean our dishes, we
use a dishwasher that has a motor.

29
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,049
If you look at our washing machine
that has a motor, your, our heating

30
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:51,220
equipments, our cooling equipments,
the HVAC industry uses a lot of motor.

31
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,559
And there are industrial applications for
them, which goes into compressors, which

32
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:59,169
are required in a lot of factories today.

33
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:02,119
We need conveyors, we need
automation, we need robotics.

34
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,834
All of the places, it's it is a
requirement and it that has become

35
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,569
a foundational component of whether
we want it or whether we don't.

36
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,519
So what happens with that?

37
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:14,360
With that foundational
component, anything goes wrong.

38
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,549
There are down times, there
are catastrophic problems.

39
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:23,049
There are issues and the list goes
on and on, which is a integral part

40
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:24,779
of the complexities that keep coming.

41
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:30,359
Now the research or the thesis that
I have developed upon works upon the

42
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:34,850
reliability of these machines and also
predicting the reliability of these

43
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,860
machines, using certain techniques.

44
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,590
Now, one also has to understand that
these machines by the virtue are

45
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,650
foundational, but are also very commodity.

46
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,090
When you look into these particular
motors these motors, could lie in

47
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,570
the bracket of DC and AC motors.

48
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,530
This thesis that I have performed is
predominantly on the AC motors, although,

49
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,930
the BLDC motors, which are the brush
brushless DC motors and the switch

50
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,740
reluctance motors also come into this
arena of the thesis that I have performed.

51
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,700
Let sorry.

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,710
Now let's understand the construction
of these motors, before that let's break

53
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,450
down the entire construction of a motor.

54
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,280
Like I mentioned to you it works
on a very simplifi days principle.

55
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,020
You have an electrical motion
being electrical current that is

56
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,230
given to them to, to an equipment.

57
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,290
This particular equipment gives
you current take motion, and this

58
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,725
kinetic motion, could be rotary, you
can then translate that to linear.

59
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,120
Or more complex mechanisms.

60
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,380
Now, if you look into this entire chart,
and if I have to break this down as a

61
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,670
block diagram, you have an input, you
have a process which is basically your

62
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,150
motor, and you have an output, which
is basically your mechanical motion.

63
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,520
Now if you really look into all
of this the way you can basically

64
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:56,490
identify what are the areas on, on
these motors, could be based on the

65
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,320
design specifications of the motor.

66
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,990
So if the motor was desired
to run at a particular RPM.

67
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,610
It was desired to run
at a particular torque.

68
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:09,690
All of that is something that is available
with the motor, with the specifications,

69
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,550
and you can configure them using a drive.

70
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:17,750
The other aspects, could be, they have to
be positioned into specific environments

71
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,810
and you can measure the temperature
around it, the vibration around it.

72
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,300
And the electrical signals, which are
very foundational and many of the motors

73
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,560
today go through that particular process.

74
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,330
Then, you have alarms that come in,
saying that, hey, if the motor is

75
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,860
not performing well and, there is
an emergency stop, you can basically

76
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,690
have threshold based alarms around it.

77
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:38,715
Saying that, Hey, this has to
operate in a certain temperature.

78
00:04:38,715 --> 00:04:41,094
It has to operate in
a certain environment.

79
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:44,365
And, you can basically set up those
alarms and they are existing today.

80
00:04:44,365 --> 00:04:48,499
And the the way on this, the
predictability has been predominantly

81
00:04:48,499 --> 00:04:52,019
by the intelligence of a person who
has been working on this particular

82
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:53,399
industry for several years.

83
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:55,179
Based on that, one can imagine.

84
00:04:55,644 --> 00:04:59,934
Looking at a motor he or she can
understand that there are emerging faults.

85
00:05:00,124 --> 00:05:02,744
And that is a signal and you
go and do the prediction.

86
00:05:03,224 --> 00:05:06,584
But net, if you look at all
of the scenario, all of these

87
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:08,144
things, were done in isolation.

88
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:11,084
They were done in silos,
buckets, or in one.

89
00:05:11,574 --> 00:05:14,664
Ability to identify
based on the experience.

90
00:05:14,694 --> 00:05:15,894
One has experienced.

91
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:21,644
So there has not been the ability
to stitch in all of these inputs and

92
00:05:21,644 --> 00:05:26,894
create an AI model to tell you when and
where and how the motors can go fault.

93
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:31,654
Now the approach that we, we identified
to, to solve this was basically taking

94
00:05:31,654 --> 00:05:33,244
all of the layers that were foundational.

95
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:35,984
We spoke about the temperature,
we spoke about the vibration, we

96
00:05:35,984 --> 00:05:39,534
spoke about the input currents we
spoke about the design conformance,

97
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:42,534
we spoke about one's intelligence,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

98
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:46,694
And, we basically try to create
a multi-layer decision process.

99
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:50,054
And that becomes my first point,
which is multi-layer diagnostics.

100
00:05:50,694 --> 00:05:56,134
Second is, the ability to take the data
that is coming from specific sense points.

101
00:05:56,484 --> 00:06:00,264
It could be a sensor that you have
incorporated in internally, or it could

102
00:06:00,264 --> 00:06:03,484
be the soft sensors and identifying them.

103
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:07,339
To a particular failure point
or to a maintenance point.

104
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:11,199
And using the power of mathematics
in the form of vectors and

105
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:12,659
ai, is the second point.

106
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:13,829
Which we studied upon.

107
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:17,969
And the third was, to take the
layers of diagnosis or the layers

108
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:22,229
of decision making integrated with
what can be extrapolated and creating

109
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:23,519
an intelligence model around it.

110
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:28,299
So again, let me give this down in a
much more easier manner for you all.

111
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:32,539
There is this motor, the motor
has its own ways of of identifying

112
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:34,069
what can go wrong in it.

113
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:38,459
And to that, there are several methods
that are already been in practice.

114
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:45,219
We are taking those methods and creating
a automation through ai, to identify

115
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:46,779
what could be these failure points.

116
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,679
So let's break it down.

117
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:54,210
The way I broke down the block diagram
for us the first, is the input block.

118
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,850
Then you have the process block,
and you have the output block.

119
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,979
And let's call the
entire thing as a design.

120
00:06:59,905 --> 00:07:03,015
Now the first analysis that you
know, or the layers that you are

121
00:07:03,015 --> 00:07:06,315
speaking about for decision making
comes from the design conformance.

122
00:07:06,895 --> 00:07:11,545
The design conformance basically indicates
to how is the motor supposed to behave?

123
00:07:11,575 --> 00:07:16,145
What is the talk, whether it is being
driven on a 60 hertz signal, whether it is

124
00:07:16,194 --> 00:07:19,955
to be driven on a 50 hertz signal whether
it's a four pole machine, whether it's a

125
00:07:19,955 --> 00:07:22,305
six pole machine whether all of this has.

126
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,775
A good load condition.

127
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,580
Does it behave good on
a no load condition?

128
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,440
How does it behave on
a full load condition?

129
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,720
And creating the thermal
behavior patterns around it.

130
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,110
Predominantly this kind of a test which
is called design conformance test.

131
00:07:36,525 --> 00:07:38,845
Is validated, through a circle diagram.

132
00:07:38,895 --> 00:07:42,240
Where, you basically plot the the
thermal profile, basically put the

133
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,350
load, no load and load conditions.

134
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,290
And I'm sure, whoever's an electrical
engineer would've gone through their labs

135
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,270
and they know what a circle diagram is.

136
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:54,330
And, based on that you can basically
identify what is the motor supposed

137
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,560
to do and whether it is doing the.

138
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,720
The actual theory now, when you try to
take all of that data and digitize it

139
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,820
in the form of a data platform, that
becomes your design signature analysis.

140
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,910
Now, in the design signature
analysis, you're validating what

141
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,230
the talk requirement should be.

142
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,410
This could be an integral part of
a drive, and you're taking that

143
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,850
information or you can measure them.

144
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:17,225
Self, the RPM we are speaking of the
mechanical adjustments that you're trying

145
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:20,315
to do, in terms of whether it has been
fixed properly, whether it has been

146
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:22,355
housed properly and things like that.

147
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:25,115
The thermal behavior, because
many of these motors, come with

148
00:08:25,115 --> 00:08:26,985
an integral thermocouple devices.

149
00:08:26,985 --> 00:08:30,445
So you know, you will identify whether
these motors are going beyond a particular

150
00:08:30,445 --> 00:08:32,185
threshold or not, and so on and so forth.

151
00:08:32,215 --> 00:08:34,045
So that is the design signature analysis.

152
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:37,785
And this is layer one of multi-layers
that we were speaking about, which is

153
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:39,195
where you do this particular analysis.

154
00:08:39,695 --> 00:08:40,205
Second.

155
00:08:40,725 --> 00:08:43,135
Again, coming back to that block
diagram, you remember, you had the

156
00:08:43,135 --> 00:08:46,435
input, you had the process, and
you had the output in the input.

157
00:08:46,465 --> 00:08:50,045
You basically try to feed
in mostly a current, right?

158
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:51,415
That's how the motor works.

159
00:08:51,635 --> 00:08:54,965
When the current is fed into the motor,
you basically identify whether it is

160
00:08:54,965 --> 00:08:57,125
a 60 hertz motor or 50 hertz motor.

161
00:08:57,515 --> 00:09:00,275
And based on that you
basically try to identify.

162
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,530
What pole machine it is, it's a
four pole or a six pole machine.

163
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,540
And on there, you basically know that
you have a constant voltage and to that

164
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,780
con constant voltage you're feeding in
current that's how the motor works, right?

165
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,480
And in this scenario, you basically
use the power of fast for your

166
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,580
transform, which is FFTs to identify.

167
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:22,405
The the FOIA transform of the
sinusoidal wave that you are feeding in.

168
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:25,285
Now, the sinusoidal wave
in this particular scenario

169
00:09:25,635 --> 00:09:27,105
is got to be a pure wave.

170
00:09:27,105 --> 00:09:30,400
Suppose, it's a sinusoidal wave, and
if you try to give sinoc sinusoidal

171
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:35,310
wave into a phosphoria transform you'll
basically start seeing harmonics.

172
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,020
You'll start seeing harmonics at say
this was a 60 herdz sinusoidal wave.

173
00:09:39,405 --> 00:09:43,125
You'll start seeing them at 60 Hertz, then
you'll see them at one 20, then you'll

174
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,345
see them at 180 two 40 and so forth.

175
00:09:46,325 --> 00:09:48,515
Now that's how the
mathematics has to behave.

176
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:53,695
But when you try to put the sinusoidal
wave, through the motor and when you're

177
00:09:53,695 --> 00:09:57,085
trying to measure, there is a back
EMF that is generated by the motor

178
00:09:57,085 --> 00:09:58,795
because every motor is also a generator.

179
00:09:58,855 --> 00:09:59,755
Let's remember that.

180
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:04,005
And when there's a back MF these
sinusoidal waves, get a distortion.

181
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,940
Now when you take the fast four year
transform and you basically have

182
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,460
a current sensor and this current
sensor is fed, to your Fast four year

183
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,700
transform on your MATLAB or any of the
tools that you're using, you'll start

184
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,910
seeing that there is a spike at 60,
there's a spike at one 20, there's a

185
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,790
spike at 180 and but along with that.

186
00:10:21,035 --> 00:10:22,535
You have side bands.

187
00:10:22,895 --> 00:10:26,325
Now, your appearance on this,
would look like there is a one

188
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:29,535
60, and then you have these side
bands that are associated to it.

189
00:10:29,965 --> 00:10:32,815
And many a times, these side
bands are considered to be noise.

190
00:10:32,815 --> 00:10:34,320
And, we, I we eliminate that.

191
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,800
Right now in this particular scenario,
what we basically identify to do is, let's

192
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,800
call this particular pattern with the main
spike and the side bands as a signature.

193
00:10:44,505 --> 00:10:47,745
Now this particular signature is
very unique to a motor that has

194
00:10:47,745 --> 00:10:52,680
been produced and has to adhere to a
certain design conformance right now.

195
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,390
Now, I and assume that this
particular motor is going through

196
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:00,110
its own life cycle, it's losing its
stock, it's losing its attributes,

197
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,810
of what what it should behave like.

198
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,460
The side bands change.

199
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,930
So the side bands, could.

200
00:11:05,135 --> 00:11:07,705
Change in amplitude, or
it can change in width.

201
00:11:08,075 --> 00:11:10,660
And that's where, you identify
that there's something going,

202
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,620
something really wrong with E motor.

203
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,070
And you can identify those
and compare those harmonics to

204
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,690
identify anomalies in a motor.

205
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,810
So again, let me give you the layer one.

206
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,640
Layer one was on design conformance.

207
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:27,750
Layer two is, you're identifying what can
go wrong inside a motor through the input.

208
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,690
Now let's get to the layer three.

209
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,720
Now, like I mentioned, every
motor, has got an output.

210
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,450
Now this particular output is
what you measure the motor for.

211
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:41,510
How good the motor is, that's how the
output and the behavior of the motor is

212
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,370
supposed to work for a particular thing.

213
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:47,445
Now in this particular case, when you
look at the motor or when you hear the

214
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:49,435
motor, there are certain reactions to it.

215
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:53,195
There is a certain amount of noise
that is generated on these motors.

216
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:58,165
And these noise is not necessarily
only audio, it could be thermal, it

217
00:11:58,165 --> 00:12:00,015
could be vibration, and so forth.

218
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,725
So when you try to house the
motor and when you keep them in

219
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:07,395
play there is a lot of, thermal
outburst that happens in a motor.

220
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:08,835
When you touch a motor, it becomes hot.

221
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:12,740
And, suppose, you know how much hot
it is becoming this could be a good,

222
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,800
could be a good example, from the
region that I come in, India, the way

223
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,130
we would know the blenders are getting
over overloaded, was the sound of the

224
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,830
motor or, touching these, the surface of
the blender, which would get very hot.

225
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,590
And we would immediately get to know
that there's something wrong here.

226
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,640
Either we need to reduce the
load or, basically get basically

227
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,755
get the changes done on it.

228
00:12:31,235 --> 00:12:34,975
So it's the same principle, if you,
I imagine instead of a human being,

229
00:12:34,975 --> 00:12:38,875
you have a sensor there or a soft
point, where you can identify the.

230
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,460
The vibration, you can identify the noise.

231
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,320
Best example, you're driving a
car and there's some rattling

232
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,460
noise that comes in your car.

233
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,460
The first thing that you as a human
being, would identify this saying

234
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,510
that, Hey, there's something wrong.

235
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,280
It could be because my dashboard not
doing well, or my seats are squeaking,

236
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,510
or there's something wrong with.

237
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,950
My engine, same scenario.

238
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,100
We are trying to now
apply that on a motor.

239
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,320
There's something going wrong with
a motor, it could be in the form of

240
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,040
vibration, it could be in the heat,
it could be in the sound and the

241
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,320
efficiency itself and that, we are
trying to categorize them as reactions.

242
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,230
Now, all of these reactions
could be absolute data.

243
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,360
It could be raw data and it
could be unstructured data.

244
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,270
Now storing all of this unstructured
data, you can basically pull them

245
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,670
into a document model in a database,
and then try to retrieve them.

246
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,990
The possibilities are endless.

247
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,890
But, the layer three basically
identifies the the reaction around it.

248
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:32,295
Now, what do you do with
all this information, right?

249
00:13:32,565 --> 00:13:35,195
You had layer one, which was
giving you design conformance.

250
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:38,315
You had layer two, where you're
basically using current signature

251
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:40,145
patterns, to identify the default.

252
00:13:40,505 --> 00:13:43,115
Then you have layer three
and you'll be like, Ari, how

253
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,135
many more layers do you need?

254
00:13:44,135 --> 00:13:45,755
You're speaking about
multiple layers here.

255
00:13:46,235 --> 00:13:50,015
Now the fourth layer that we are speaking
about is integrating all of this together.

256
00:13:50,475 --> 00:13:53,535
It's basically trying to create
an A plus B plus C, equals

257
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,675
to some kind of an anomaly.

258
00:13:54,985 --> 00:13:57,775
And that's where the beauty
of the vectorization comes in.

259
00:13:57,815 --> 00:14:02,625
And that particular layer we speak, we, we
call it as the aging signature analysis.

260
00:14:03,105 --> 00:14:05,835
Now in the aging signature
analysis, you have a baseline.

261
00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:08,195
We, you remember I was speaking about
the standard signature patterns.

262
00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:12,575
And then from there, you basically
are pumping in more data.

263
00:14:12,575 --> 00:14:16,325
You're trying to extrapolate data from
design, through your current signatures

264
00:14:16,325 --> 00:14:19,985
through your reaction, and you're
trying to create a algorithm around

265
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:22,200
it to identify points of failure.

266
00:14:22,615 --> 00:14:24,025
So let's take an example here.

267
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:27,605
There is this particular motor
which was operating to, to run

268
00:14:27,655 --> 00:14:29,035
in a compressor application.

269
00:14:29,605 --> 00:14:32,755
Now, compressor applications are pretty
discreet, it was, the motor was being

270
00:14:32,935 --> 00:14:34,885
leveraged as a limited anger talker.

271
00:14:35,465 --> 00:14:37,655
And it was rotating at a particular load.

272
00:14:38,105 --> 00:14:41,905
And suddenly, you identify that the
compressor values, were getting were

273
00:14:41,905 --> 00:14:44,425
getting skewed up, which was ultimately.

274
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,610
Hampering the entire the plant operation.

275
00:14:48,495 --> 00:14:52,885
And in this, what you basically identified
was my compressor is not doing well.

276
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:56,165
In a old environment, you would go
basically get the new compressor,

277
00:14:56,165 --> 00:14:59,105
new motor, you'd replace all of
them, or, based on your knowledge,

278
00:14:59,125 --> 00:14:59,820
you would do one or the other.

279
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:03,945
Now imagine a point where, you
have data that is coming from your

280
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,915
concurrent signature analysis,
which basically is speaking about

281
00:15:07,245 --> 00:15:08,565
the motor and the motor health.

282
00:15:09,135 --> 00:15:12,645
Now, based on the reaction, you're
basically identifying the application

283
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,295
that happened to the motor was at fault.

284
00:15:14,865 --> 00:15:17,295
And the design conformance
saying that, your motor has to

285
00:15:17,295 --> 00:15:18,525
behave in a particular manner.

286
00:15:19,065 --> 00:15:24,065
Now that information from design flowing
in through input flow or current.

287
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,690
Flowing into the out the output could
basically tell you the aging trend

288
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:33,530
of the motor and that aging trend,
could mean bearing wear wear and tear.

289
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,250
It could mean winding losses.

290
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,780
It could mean resistance changes.

291
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,220
It could mean the overall
installation integrity.

292
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,440
The installation takes a
beating at a particular point.

293
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,260
Now, rather than changing the
entire system now, what are the

294
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,760
pointers that are spoiled in it?

295
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,380
Before they are getting spoiled and, you
have a predictive maintenance that can

296
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,090
be taken care on those particular meters.

297
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,120
So that's where stitching this information
from layer one to two, to three to

298
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,130
four which I call it as aging signature
analysis, becomes very important.

299
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:05,410
Now let's speak about how all
this data is flowing today.

300
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,760
There is the power of sensors.

301
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,630
Most of the sensors are inbuilt.

302
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,050
Again just be, take in mind, all
these motors are commodities.

303
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:18,990
They are bought by k. Or pounds and not
necessarily, to, to a specialized value.

304
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,370
There are specialized motors as well.

305
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,900
Please don't get me wrong there,
but, many a times, the amount of

306
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,430
r and d that they would do on a
particular motor would be very limited.

307
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,520
So what do we have to do with, we have
to take the power of the existing sensor.

308
00:16:32,955 --> 00:16:34,395
And vectorize the data around it.

309
00:16:35,205 --> 00:16:38,925
Vectorization is the most important part,
so you get the basic information in terms

310
00:16:38,925 --> 00:16:43,155
of temperature, vibration, elect the
electrical inputs and so on and so forth.

311
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:47,295
Then vectorizing that data using the
power of mathematics to vectorize

312
00:16:47,295 --> 00:16:52,245
and identify what could happen with
this particular vector on vibration.

313
00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:53,145
What could be the.

314
00:16:53,435 --> 00:16:55,570
The effect they could
the cause and effect.

315
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,940
And identifying early detections of
failure, becomes much more critical.

316
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,270
Now it's not given that, if you have
this data and you vectorize them,

317
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,770
you'll get the early detection.

318
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:09,190
Early detection has to be associated
with similar measurements and

319
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,930
similar defects and anomalies.

320
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,590
That the system keeps learning.

321
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,900
And as it keeps learning more
and more, the early detection

322
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,800
becomes a lot more predictable.

323
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,760
Now so like I was mentioning, creating
a platform, that keeps building upon

324
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,850
these anomalies, learning upon these
anomalies and creating these patterns the

325
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:32,610
trends around it you know are something
that we you know we identified them

326
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,290
through our con continuous learning
loop now this continuous learning loop,

327
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:41,070
leveraged a lot of database and I'll use
a lot of document models of database.

328
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,020
So there was a lot of unstructured data.

329
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,290
We could take photographs, videos,
and, try to pump in as much data as we

330
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:50,860
could and streamline that particular
data onto an AI path in creating models

331
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,150
around it using vector models around it.

332
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,435
To identify the specific failures, like
the ones that I was just mentioning

333
00:17:56,435 --> 00:18:00,675
to you about, what are the operational
benefits and outcomes, just imagine,

334
00:18:00,675 --> 00:18:04,665
the economics of a, of an industry
where, you have zero downtime coming

335
00:18:04,665 --> 00:18:06,015
because of electrical machines.

336
00:18:06,355 --> 00:18:09,685
So I've given you an example on
a rotating electrical machines.

337
00:18:09,685 --> 00:18:13,115
You can use this for anything in,
in the electrical environments.

338
00:18:13,365 --> 00:18:16,325
Currently we are doing more research
around it and, we would be having.

339
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,100
The you know the loads, no.

340
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,400
Typically an electrical motor is an
inductive and a capacitive node load.

341
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,190
We are trying to do this on pure resistive
loads, and more complex loads as well.

342
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,040
But what does that mean
from an operational benefits

343
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,000
and outcome standpoint?

344
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,360
We have more predictable we have
a preventive maintenance model.

345
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,120
That means, you don't have
to do firefighting after the

346
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,590
event has happened or occurred.

347
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,910
You can do it much before you have
reduced downtime, in, in specific

348
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:46,030
environments and factories, and
you have enhanced reliability.

349
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,280
So that means your systems
are a lot more reliable.

350
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:53,100
And the underlining benefit is the overall
cost advantage because of the workflow.

351
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,700
Streamline a streamlined, a workflow
that, we've been able to create with this.

352
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,205
So again, from a DevOps alignment
standpoint, there is data-driven

353
00:19:02,205 --> 00:19:05,535
decisions, there is continuous monitoring
that is happening and learning,

354
00:19:05,865 --> 00:19:08,985
and there is resilient operations
that is driving this philosophy.

355
00:19:09,485 --> 00:19:11,715
I just spoke about it,
the implementation for.

356
00:19:12,405 --> 00:19:15,855
For considerations include
an existing sensor network.

357
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:20,245
I taking the inputs from the sensor
network and creating a data architecture

358
00:19:20,675 --> 00:19:22,535
a data platform, so to speak.

359
00:19:22,925 --> 00:19:26,375
And from there, creating a system
integrated view and from there,

360
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:30,335
creating AI models and from that
AI models, basically feed in

361
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,470
information, for whatever application
you would like to do that.

362
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,380
That was about my presentation.

363
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,900
I would be very happy
to answer any questions.

364
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,820
Like I mentioned, my name is Avi.

365
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,510
I go by Aviana sister.

366
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,750
I am the principal at MongoDB
currently managing the strategic

367
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,690
relations and partnerships for
our system integrator market.

368
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,940
Looking forward to speaking with you all.

369
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,980
Thank you again, and
thank you for your time.
