1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:02,640
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,019
Hope everyone is fine.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,360
My name is Hari Esh Babo gdi, having
totally yourself experience in

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,420
enterprise workflow architecture with
a strong focus on AI powered process

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,335
optimization and robotic automation.

6
00:00:19,115 --> 00:00:26,805
Currently I serve as architect where
I design, develop, and support the

7
00:00:27,105 --> 00:00:31,724
intelligent workforce systems that
seamlessly integrate real time

8
00:00:31,724 --> 00:00:36,405
decision making, artificial in
intelligence and end-to-end automation.

9
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:42,825
My work is centered around solving
the complex business problems and

10
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:44,655
enhancing the operational efficiency.

11
00:00:45,914 --> 00:00:50,474
Throughout my career, I had the
privilege of collaborating with

12
00:00:50,474 --> 00:00:52,575
several pioneering organizations.

13
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:58,590
Across the telecom, finance and
insurance sectors driving innovation

14
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:01,349
and digital transformation at scale.

15
00:01:02,099 --> 00:01:07,259
So today I'm going to present
how multimodal AI is transforming

16
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:09,869
a patient centered healthcare.

17
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,899
Our multimodal AI framework is redefining
the landscape of modern healthcare by

18
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,200
inly, orchestrating, and integrating.

19
00:01:23,355 --> 00:01:31,565
Wide spectrum of patient data
sources, including health, healthcare

20
00:01:31,565 --> 00:01:37,445
records, variable devices, genomic
data, and patient reported outcomes.

21
00:01:38,615 --> 00:01:44,975
By synthesizing these adverse
impact in real time, we empowering

22
00:01:44,975 --> 00:01:46,625
with deep actionable insight.

23
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,160
That support precise, timely,
and personalized care decisions.

24
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:58,910
At the same time, our system elevates
administrative and cognitive burdens

25
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:05,060
on healthcare providers by automating
protein analysis and surfacing the

26
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,100
most relevant clinical information.

27
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:15,410
Ultimately, enhancing the outcomes while
optimizing the operational efficiency.

28
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,290
Multimodal approach.

29
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:25,280
So electronic healthcare records,
robust electric electronic health

30
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,400
records serve as the backbone of modern
healthcare analytics by consolidating

31
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,710
the comprehensive medical histories,
clinical nodes, and diagnostic

32
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:42,440
information, electronic healthcare
records provides the essential foundation

33
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,560
for advanced AI driven interpretation.

34
00:02:46,385 --> 00:02:48,515
Clinical decision support systems.

35
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:52,625
And the second one is
patient reported outcomes.

36
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:59,945
Direct structured input from patient
captured subject to experiences such

37
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:03,935
as pain levels or emotional wellbeing.

38
00:03:04,745 --> 00:03:08,915
Data that traditional clinical
metrics often overlook.

39
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:17,300
These insights empower clinicals to design
truly personalized care pathways based

40
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,570
on what matters most to the patients.

41
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,270
And the third one, as part of the
multimodal approach is genomic profiles.

42
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:33,770
So detailed genetic profiling enables
the application of precision medicine.

43
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:39,740
By identifying individual genetic
variations and biomarkers.

44
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:46,190
So clinicals can select highly targeted
therapies, improve treatment efficiency

45
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:54,290
and reduce adverse reactions, transform
the standard of care for complex diseases.

46
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,950
And the fourth one, as part
of the multimodal approach

47
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,125
is wearable sensor data.

48
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:07,490
So real time data from wearable devices
allows for continuous psychological

49
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:13,940
monitoring, including heart rate, sleep
patterns, physical activity, and more.

50
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:19,730
This ongoing stream of data fills
the gaps between the clinical

51
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:25,400
visits offering a dynamic view of
health trends and supporting early

52
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,780
strategies reduce your clinical burden.

53
00:04:31,055 --> 00:04:36,455
So it reduces the 42% of
the documentation time.

54
00:04:37,355 --> 00:04:44,615
So this will reduce the administrative
documentation workload, and it

55
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:52,595
saved like 3.5 hours, whatever this
hours saved these additional hours.

56
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:57,235
Clinical, the S can spend
with patients weekly.

57
00:04:58,885 --> 00:05:05,425
The third one is 89% of the provider
satisfaction where clinicians

58
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:07,915
reporting improve work-life balance.

59
00:05:09,865 --> 00:05:11,815
So enhance your patient engagement.

60
00:05:12,325 --> 00:05:16,105
So there are four things we
will cover as part of the

61
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:18,265
enhance your patient engagement.

62
00:05:18,655 --> 00:05:23,275
The first one is increase
participation and impressive.

63
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:31,000
87% of the patients are now actually
involved in their own healthcare, engaging

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,300
more deeply in treatment planning,
following Daily Health, opines and using

65
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,700
digital tools to track the wellness.

66
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,420
This behavioral shift is fostering
better health outcomes and stronger

67
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,085
adherence to the care plans satisfaction.

68
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,610
So patient experience
scores have a surge by 42%.

69
00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:01,510
A clear indicator demographics including
age gaps, socioeconomic levels, and

70
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:07,000
clinical conditions, conforming the in
universal effectiveness of personalized

71
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,000
AI support supported interventions.

72
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,020
And the third one is better communication.

73
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,330
So healthcare professionals are now.

74
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:23,530
68% more time to the
tailored care conversations.

75
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:30,700
Moving beyond the generic advice
to meaningful and patient specific

76
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:38,655
discussions, these enables more informed
decisions and stronger provider patient.

77
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,120
And the fourth one is
stronger relationship.

78
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:50,860
93% of the patients report elevated
trust in their healthcare providers.

79
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:58,930
When AI driven insights are openly shared
and clearly explained, transparency

80
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:06,070
and personalization are providing
essential in building long-term, trusted

81
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,380
partnerships between the patients.

82
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,970
Under care teams,

83
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:17,440
as part of our AI framework, there
are uncovering hidden correlations.

84
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,020
First one is their own genomic analysis.

85
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:30,670
AI examines genetic variance
across patient populations, and

86
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:35,410
the second one is the pattern
detection, so system identifies.

87
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,635
To traditional analysis method.

88
00:07:39,745 --> 00:07:42,655
And the third one is
treatment optimization.

89
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:52,045
Medications match to the generic
profiles for maximum efficiency, and

90
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:54,355
the fourth one is outcome improvement.

91
00:07:55,135 --> 00:08:00,505
Reduce adverse events and
enhance treatment responses.

92
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,620
This is the early prediction
of the patient ation.

93
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:12,520
So how our AI framework is
predicting the patient's ation.

94
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,610
Our advanced AI protection system
identifies critical determination

95
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:24,010
signals up to 48 hours before
the conventional monitoring

96
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,120
issues providing a crucial time.

97
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:36,220
Advantage for the clinical intervention
by analyzing sub psychological pattern

98
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:43,180
changes across multiple parameters
Simultaneously, the system issues

99
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:53,650
detection rates of 65 to 96% compared to
the traditional monitoring, 10 to 65%,

100
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,460
dramatically improving patient outcomes.

101
00:08:57,925 --> 00:08:59,665
In times since two scenarios,

102
00:09:01,765 --> 00:09:08,785
optimized oncology care, so it
improves the quality of life.

103
00:09:09,895 --> 00:09:16,645
Our advanced data driven approach leads
to the significant enhancements in

104
00:09:16,645 --> 00:09:23,005
patient wellbeing by delivering precisely
calibrated treatments that align with

105
00:09:23,485 --> 00:09:26,410
each clinical history genetic backup.

106
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,650
Lifestyle and ongoing health data.

107
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:35,590
By minimizing adverse effects and
maximizing therapeutic efficiency.

108
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:41,380
Patients experience better day-to-day
functionality, reduce the symptom

109
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,010
burden, and a greater sense of
control over their health journey.

110
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,920
Reduce the hospitalizations.

111
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,370
By predictive analytics,
continuous monitoring, and

112
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,140
timely clinical interventions.

113
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,750
Our AI driven care model significantly
lowers the risk of emergency

114
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:04,150
admissions by identifying the early
warning signs and addressing the

115
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,265
health issues before the xray.

116
00:10:07,045 --> 00:10:12,130
We enable proactive care management
that minimizes the complications,

117
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:15,280
reduces the unnecessary hospital visits.

118
00:10:15,775 --> 00:10:20,454
And enhances the overall healthcare
efficiency, ultimately improving

119
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,995
the both patient outcomes
and the cost effectiveness.

120
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,584
And the third one is
optimize treatment pathway.

121
00:10:29,185 --> 00:10:33,505
So leveraging the power of artificial
intelligence, our system generated

122
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:38,785
tailored treatment protocols
that are dynamically aligned with

123
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,305
each patient's clinical profile.

124
00:10:42,204 --> 00:10:46,374
Genetic makers, lifestyle
factors and realtime health data.

125
00:10:47,454 --> 00:10:53,724
This physician driven approach ensures
that care plans are evidence-based, adapt

126
00:10:53,724 --> 00:10:59,035
to and highly individualized, leading
to the foster recovery, fewer side

127
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:01,944
effects and improved treatment adherence.

128
00:11:04,254 --> 00:11:05,185
The communication.

129
00:11:05,964 --> 00:11:09,089
So how our AI framework is.

130
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:16,060
Bridging the communication gaps between
the specialist primary care and the

131
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:23,109
patients in terms of the specialist
access to the consistent, comprehensive

132
00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:30,189
patient data across all touch points and
the primary care enhancing visibility

133
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:36,430
into the specialist recommendations
and treatment ISTs AI system that

134
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,499
translates complex medical data.

135
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:41,439
Into clear, actionable recommendations.

136
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:46,449
And the fourth one is the patient's
better understanding of the complex

137
00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:49,000
medical decisions and treatment plans

138
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,189
from React two to React two care.

139
00:11:54,790 --> 00:12:00,520
So how our AI framework is

140
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:05,469
using a reactive to proactive care.

141
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,600
The shift from reactive to proactive
care in healthcare is being

142
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,850
accelerated by artificial inte
intelligence and how these diseases

143
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,720
are ED prevented and how unmanaged.

144
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:28,900
So predictive analytics and early risk
identification, AI excels at analyzing

145
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:34,870
vast amount of patient data, including
healthcare records, imaging, genetics.

146
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,735
And real time biometric inputs.

147
00:12:38,694 --> 00:12:45,625
For example, AI can detect sub progress
in the vital signs or behavior such

148
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:51,775
as a small but consistent changes in
respiration or sleep quality that may

149
00:12:51,775 --> 00:12:57,146
indicate the nearly onset of conditions
like sepsis or hyper protection.

150
00:12:58,824 --> 00:13:04,494
The personalized risk profiles and
targeted interventions, AI enables

151
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:10,254
the creation of personalized risk
profiles by integrating data from

152
00:13:10,254 --> 00:13:15,780
various sources, including genetics,
lifestyle and environmental factors,

153
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:20,964
and management, and improved outcomes.

154
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:23,785
So studies have shown that.

155
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:31,194
The proactive care management targeting
AI identified at risk patients can

156
00:13:31,194 --> 00:13:35,215
lead to the significant reductions
in preventable hospital admissions.

157
00:13:36,324 --> 00:13:44,334
For instance, one intervention at OLA
Health resulted in 27% drop in potentially

158
00:13:44,425 --> 00:13:50,485
preventable hospital admissions among
high risk patients identified by ai.

159
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:56,605
And realtime monitoring
and dynamic care plans.

160
00:13:56,905 --> 00:14:01,405
Wearable and remote monitoring
devices feed continuous data into

161
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:07,194
the AI systems enabling realtime
assessment of the patient health.

162
00:14:08,365 --> 00:14:10,785
AI can trigger alerts exist.

163
00:14:10,785 --> 00:14:16,305
Care plans are prompt outreach
when detect deviation from

164
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:20,175
expected patterns such as missing.

165
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:25,440
Missing medications are reduced
refill activity, ensuring

166
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,750
timely support and intervention.

167
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:32,580
And the last one is operational
efficiency and provider cost.

168
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:40,740
It also automates the risk screening,
trash and documentation, freeing up

169
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,230
clinicals to focus on high value tasks

170
00:14:46,105 --> 00:14:49,110
and the real world impact and.

171
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:58,350
Our comprehensive five year study
across 27 healthcare systems

172
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,740
reveals transformative improvements.

173
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:09,314
34% increase in clinical efficiency,
