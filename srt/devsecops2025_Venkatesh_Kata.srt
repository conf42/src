1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,220
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,200
I'm myself Esta, and I have two 12 plus
years of experience in the field of DevOps

3
00:00:07,229 --> 00:00:09,750
and automation middleware technologies.

4
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:14,370
Today we are going to explore one of
the most exciting and transformative

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,119
shifts happening in all of
cybersecurity and cloud engineering.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,380
We are entering an era where
security is no longer a bottleneck.

7
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,869
A final checkpoint or a
reactive process instore.

8
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:30,340
It becomes predictive, autonomous,
continuously learning, and

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,640
deeply embedded in the entire
lifecycle of software delivery.

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:40,750
AI is reshaping DevSecOps in ways we could
not have imagined even a few years ago.

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,460
What once required?

12
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,540
Massive manual effort.

13
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:48,735
Long tricycles and human
interpretation now can be handled

14
00:00:48,735 --> 00:00:51,375
automatically, often in seconds.

15
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:55,935
What previously slowed teams down
can now enable faster innovation with

16
00:00:55,935 --> 00:01:02,655
stronger production, and what used to
LMAs with noise can now be distal into

17
00:01:02,715 --> 00:01:04,875
meaningful contextual intelligence.

18
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:10,305
My goal today is to walk you through this
transformation slide by slide, and show

19
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:13,245
how AI changes not only tools and process.

20
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:16,815
Mindsets, cultures and operating models.

21
00:01:17,315 --> 00:01:19,330
Okay, DevSecOps Revolution.

22
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,800
We begin with the core
idea of this presentation.

23
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,380
AI powered autonomous cloud security.

24
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,950
The future of DevSecOps is not
just about automating tasks.

25
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:34,275
It's about intelligent systems
that can anticipate, interpret, and

26
00:01:34,275 --> 00:01:35,775
respond to threats in real time.

27
00:01:36,435 --> 00:01:39,765
Traditionally, security
was bolted on at the end.

28
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:46,275
Today we integrate AI driven security
into every stage, like design,

29
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:50,930
coding, infrastructure, provisioning,
deployment, and operations.

30
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:56,580
Moving on the security velocity
paradox, one of the oldest distinctions

31
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,450
in software engineering is the
battle between speed and security.

32
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:06,630
Teams want to deploy fast release features
quickly and keep up with business demands.

33
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,460
Security teams want.

34
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,870
Breaker, precision and deep analysis.

35
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:19,700
This mismatch leads to friction manual
gates, slow developers scanners, oral

36
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,430
security teams with thousands of alerts.

37
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,980
Compliance introduces delays that
can stall entire release, but with

38
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,894
threats evolving faster than ever.

39
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,870
We cannot sacrifice speed or security.

40
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,175
We need both.

41
00:02:34,674 --> 00:02:39,804
And AI finally allows us to achieve
that balance the AI solution.

42
00:02:40,304 --> 00:02:46,184
AI resolves this paradox by changing
the nature of security work, rather

43
00:02:46,184 --> 00:02:50,594
than reacting to vulnerabilities
after they appear, AI predicts them

44
00:02:51,225 --> 00:02:52,904
instead of waiting for reports.

45
00:02:53,295 --> 00:02:55,425
AI analyzes continuously.

46
00:02:56,055 --> 00:02:59,955
Instead of relying on humans to
shift through false positives,

47
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:05,025
AI triages, prioritizes and
even fixes issues automatically.

48
00:03:05,865 --> 00:03:07,995
AI is in just a faster scanner.

49
00:03:08,325 --> 00:03:13,365
It's an intelligent partner that enables
developers to ship faster and safer.

50
00:03:13,865 --> 00:03:16,495
Moving on beyond automation.

51
00:03:17,454 --> 00:03:20,965
This revolution goes far
beyond basic automation.

52
00:03:21,174 --> 00:03:24,745
Mission learning recognizes
subtle patterns that even

53
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:26,725
experienced analysts may miss.

54
00:03:27,385 --> 00:03:30,775
Neural networks understand
relationships across cloud

55
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:32,965
resources and traditional tools.

56
00:03:33,024 --> 00:03:34,704
Analyze in isolation.

57
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:40,375
Reinforcement learning improves
decision making with every iteration.

58
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,809
Learning from the environment
just like a human would.

59
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,579
We are shifting from procedural
automation to adaptive intelligence.

60
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:56,339
Moving on to Evolution of DevSecOps, let's
take a broader look at how we got here.

61
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,109
Legacy security.

62
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:05,849
Security occurred at end, painful, slow,
and was a bit risky early DevSecOps.

63
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:10,950
Shift left, improved timing,
but still rely heavily on

64
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,950
manual work tool proliferation.

65
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,250
Tools multiplied, but context didn't.

66
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,330
Teams were buried in
alerts, AI revolution.

67
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,100
Now we use intelligence prediction
and automation to reduce

68
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,170
noise and increase accuracy.

69
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,175
This evaluation is shaping the next
decade of software engineering.

70
00:04:33,675 --> 00:04:38,475
Core AI technologies mission
learning moral strain on

71
00:04:38,475 --> 00:04:43,095
millions of core samples can spot
vulnerabilities never seen before.

72
00:04:43,755 --> 00:04:46,935
Neural networks analyze
cloud configurations

73
00:04:46,935 --> 00:04:49,095
holistically, not individually.

74
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:53,525
Reinforcement learning finds
the most secure and these

75
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:54,845
relationships attackers don't.

76
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:57,205
Compromise one resource.

77
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:00,865
They chain misconfigurations
to move laterally.

78
00:05:01,555 --> 00:05:06,655
GNNS can detect these multi-step
attack parts in ways that

79
00:05:06,715 --> 00:05:08,995
humans simply cannot scale to.

80
00:05:09,985 --> 00:05:13,915
This is the next frontier of
cloud security intelligence.

81
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:16,395
Architectural implementation.

82
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:21,045
A critical factor in successful
adoption is seamless integration.

83
00:05:21,795 --> 00:05:28,275
AI must be unusable to users working
inside the IDE scanning IAE during pull

84
00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:32,955
requests, validating deployments in
real time technologies like federated

85
00:05:33,225 --> 00:05:38,925
learning model versioning and continuous
feedback cycles ensure these systems

86
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:40,815
evolve without causing disruption.

87
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:41,345
Okay.

88
00:05:41,845 --> 00:05:46,015
One of the most powerful outcomes
of AI adoption is automated

89
00:05:46,015 --> 00:05:47,515
vulnerability remediation.

90
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:52,135
Traditional workflows involve
security scanning, ticket creation,

91
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:57,835
developer rework, reviews, and
retesting a cycle that can take weeks.

92
00:05:58,435 --> 00:06:03,445
AI shortens this to minutes by fixing
common vulnerabilities automatically.

93
00:06:04,075 --> 00:06:08,155
While preserving the controls
collectively, if each setting looks

94
00:06:08,155 --> 00:06:13,045
correct individually, AI can detect
dangerous interactions between them.

95
00:06:13,825 --> 00:06:19,165
Many organizations have discovered
issues they were unaware of for

96
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:22,195
years thanks to AI analysis.

97
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:25,245
Moving on to predictive security.

98
00:06:25,745 --> 00:06:29,225
This slide actually captures the
heart of modern cybersecurity

99
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:35,765
prediction, AI analysis, behavior
patterns, commit histories, deployment

100
00:06:35,765 --> 00:06:37,655
trends and infrastructure changes.

101
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:40,865
To anticipate where vulnerabilities
are likely to occur.

102
00:06:41,365 --> 00:06:45,415
This moves us from firefighting
to foresight, dramatically

103
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:47,305
improving resilience.

104
00:06:47,805 --> 00:06:49,365
Continuous compliance.

105
00:06:50,055 --> 00:06:55,935
Compliance has historically been slow,
and this makes regulated industries more

106
00:06:55,935 --> 00:06:58,755
efficient and significantly reduces risk.

107
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,065
AI decisions must be explainable.

108
00:07:01,575 --> 00:07:07,635
We address these with adversarial
training, differential privacy, federator

109
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:11,955
learning, and model explainability
frameworks like lime and sharp.

110
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:15,285
Responsible AI is essential.

111
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,880
New skills and team structures.

112
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,750
Security engineers must
understand ML basics.

113
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,330
ML engineers must understand security.

114
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,260
Cross-functional collaboration
becomes the default operating model.

115
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,410
Importantly, we frame AI as an
augmentation tool, not a threat to jobs

116
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,940
strategic implementation roadmap.

117
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,200
AI transformation isn't
just about technology.

118
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,250
It requires new skills and
team structures, strategic

119
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,870
implementation roadmap.

120
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,300
To adopt AI in DevSecOps,
organizations must access maturity.

121
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:58,330
Start with high value pilots decide
on build versus buy measure outcomes.

122
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,625
Scale successful initiatives.

123
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:05,860
AI is long-term journey that
requires iteration and adaptability.

124
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,800
Autonomous security operations.

125
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:14,380
The future is autonomous AI agents
will investigate threats, generate

126
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:19,210
policies, analyze cloud, posture,
and handle incident response.

127
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:24,790
Humans will oversee strategy,
ethics, and complex decision making.

128
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,770
This is where the industry is
going, and organizations that

129
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,230
prepare now will lead the future.

130
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,930
Thank you for your time.

131
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,460
AI driven SecOps is not
just an exciting idea.

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,490
It's a necessity for modern organizations.

133
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:45,100
It improves speed, accuracy, resilience,
and overall security posture.

134
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,540
As we conclude, I want to
leave with this thought.

135
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,080
Security is no longer about
reacting to the last thread.

136
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,270
It's about predicting the next one.

137
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,660
AI gives us the ability to stay ahead.

138
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,710
To build systems that
learn, heal, and adapt.

139
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,920
The future of DevSecOps is autonomous,
intelligent, and resilient, and the

140
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,920
organizations that embrace this future
today will be the leaders of tomorrow.

141
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,300
Thank you once again.
