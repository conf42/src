1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,449
My name is.

2
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:06,050
Today we're gonna discuss about
realtime data analytics in the

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,290
cloud, enabling enterprise making.

4
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:14,880
We're gonna discuss about how, modern
cloud architecture and scalable

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,580
infrastructure can revolutionize your
organization's ability to harness data

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,759
and enhance operational efficiency and
deliver superior customer experiences.

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:33,620
So the global cloud analytics market
is experiencing a rapid growth valued

8
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:45,795
at 22 point 23.2 billion in 2020, and
projected to, expand at, CAGR of 24.3%.

9
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:50,645
Increasing adoption of cloud-based
business intelligence tools across

10
00:00:50,645 --> 00:00:56,195
various industries, particularly in
banking, finance, and insurance sector.

11
00:00:56,695 --> 00:01:01,780
So the core components of realtime
analytics are data ingestion layer,

12
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,590
data crossing, layer, storage layer.

13
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:09,840
So we're going to talk in
detail about how these layers,

14
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,070
will perform their operations.

15
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,430
So in data ingestion, layer sing,
seamlessly, integrates real-time data,

16
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:24,210
streams from iot devices, applications,
and third party source, as while

17
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,210
maintaining data quality and consistency.

18
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:34,155
So in the processing layer, we leverage,
a distributed comp computing and in

19
00:01:34,155 --> 00:01:40,605
memory processing to execute complex
analytics ML models and business logic

20
00:01:40,605 --> 00:01:47,605
with millisecond latency in the storage
layer, it implements hybrid storage

21
00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:54,524
architecture, combining in memory casing
and persistent storage to optimize both.

22
00:01:54,975 --> 00:01:56,295
Speed and durability.

23
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:03,145
Modern real-time analytics systems are
built on three, interconnected pillars

24
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:06,235
of functions in perfect synchronization.

25
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:14,725
The data ingestion layer acts as a robust
front door, handling massive throughput of

26
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:21,535
up to millions of events per second while
ensuring data integrity and for format.

27
00:02:22,035 --> 00:02:28,455
Consistency this continuous stream
flow into processing layer while

28
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:35,235
sophisticated distributed algorithms
and machine learning models transform

29
00:02:35,295 --> 00:02:40,055
raw data into business insights
within milliseconds, the storage layer

30
00:02:40,445 --> 00:02:46,435
completes the, this architecture by
implementing a hybrid approach combining,

31
00:02:46,995 --> 00:02:49,035
blazing fast in memory processing.

32
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:54,675
persistence towards to maintain both
performance, and data durability.

33
00:02:55,125 --> 00:03:00,225
This carefully orchestrated system
empowers organizations to make

34
00:03:00,585 --> 00:03:06,115
precise, data driven at speed
of their business operations.

35
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:07,585
So it's

36
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:08,835
performance.

37
00:03:09,335 --> 00:03:18,605
So Max Throughput is about 800 K. Stable
throughput is about 300 K and utilization

38
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:21,755
threshold around eight per 80%.

39
00:03:22,255 --> 00:03:27,209
The data ingestion layers serves
as a critical foundation of

40
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,849
realtime analytics success.

41
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,469
Advance streaming platforms
like Apache Kafka deliver ex

42
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:37,045
exceptional throughput capabilities.

43
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:44,709
Which perform with performance carefully
balance between message volume and size

44
00:03:45,369 --> 00:03:51,700
to ensure consistent service quality
organization should implement proactive

45
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:59,199
monitoring and maintain utilization below
ET threshold, which allows, headroom

46
00:03:59,499 --> 00:04:06,200
for unexpected traffic spikes while,
System pon, responsiveness processing,

47
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,069
layer optimization, horizontal scaling.

48
00:04:09,309 --> 00:04:13,679
we have three components here,
horizontal scaling, resource allocation,

49
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:19,789
consistent performance, horizontal,
scaling, es, cloud native, elasticity.

50
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:25,989
To automatically scale,
processing capability kept up

51
00:04:25,989 --> 00:04:31,479
to 300% higher workloads while
maintaining consistent performance.

52
00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:37,719
This ensures response times stay
within 10% of baseline event

53
00:04:37,719 --> 00:04:39,489
during peak demand periods.

54
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:40,979
efficiency by.

55
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,959
Targeting 60 to 70% CP
utilization in normal operations.

56
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,479
This creates a safe buffer zone as
performance degrades rapidly when

57
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:59,929
utilizing exceeds 85%, leading to, missile
processing deadlines and, potential system

58
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:03,159
bottlenecks, consistent performance.

59
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:07,569
So implement robust scaling mechanisms.

60
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:14,799
Guarantee, stable response times
within one 50 milliseconds, window.

61
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:19,749
During dynamic scaling events,
this architecture ensures,

62
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:27,649
performance with 95% of, requests
completing within 2200 milliseconds,

63
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:29,779
even at a maximum system load.

64
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,589
Storage layer, considerations.

65
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:38,109
So while, we discuss about the
storage layer consideration, we

66
00:05:38,109 --> 00:05:39,999
mainly consider three points.

67
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:41,049
Yeah.

68
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:48,489
Throughput performance, tied data,
retention and scaling and late Z profile.

69
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:51,369
So in right throughput performance.

70
00:05:51,869 --> 00:06:00,179
distributor storage systems maintain right
throughput of up to, 100,000 events per

71
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:07,559
second, per node when properly configured
with the performance, heavily dependent

72
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:11,829
on data, partitioning strategies.

73
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:19,199
tide data retention systems, implementing
tide storage, strategies, demonstrate

74
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:24,949
30% improvement in query response
time, compared to our single tire

75
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:32,189
implementation, particularly for data
less than 24 scaling latency profile.

76
00:06:32,594 --> 00:06:40,774
so storage systems, maintains consistent
latency, profiles up to 85% capacity

77
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:43,834
threshold beyond this point, right?

78
00:06:44,134 --> 00:06:52,499
Latencies increase by approximately
20% for every 5% increase in.

79
00:06:52,999 --> 00:07:00,229
85, 80 5% to monitor the system to
80%, 85% of the capacity threshold,

80
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:02,199
event driven architecture.

81
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:06,279
So there are four, key points
we need to discuss here.

82
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:11,269
One is handles, five 50,000
plus, concurrent events per

83
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:13,280
second with zero message losses.

84
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,860
So low latency sub, hundred
milliseconds response.

85
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,180
Time for real, time making improved
efficiency, 35 per percent.

86
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:29,310
Faster processing with 40%
lower, resource utilization.

87
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,600
So optimal, batch size.

88
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,060
So 25 event, micro batches.

89
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:41,990
Maximize throughput, latency, balance,
event driven, architecture serve as

90
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:47,810
a, cornerstone for modern realtime
analytics enabling, data processing

91
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,810
and immediate business insights.

92
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:58,190
empirical testing demonstrate,
35% improvement in processing

93
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,535
speed while reducing.

94
00:08:00,155 --> 00:08:05,465
Infrastructure costs by 40% compared
to traditional batch processing system.

95
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:11,125
By implementing a precise micro
batch sizing and intelligent

96
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:17,035
event, routing organizations can
achieve the optimal balance between

97
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:22,675
system response and, resource
efficiency, security, and compliance.

98
00:08:23,095 --> 00:08:24,655
Encryption overhead.

99
00:08:24,785 --> 00:08:30,935
enterprise grade AEs encryption
provides robust security with a minimal

100
00:08:30,935 --> 00:08:38,705
impact, adding only 2.3%, to crossing
time while ensuring complete data

101
00:08:38,705 --> 00:08:41,045
protection across distribution system.

102
00:08:41,045 --> 00:08:44,995
So with, with less,
process processing time.

103
00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:47,915
We can incorporate, encryption.

104
00:08:48,415 --> 00:08:51,665
So second authorization,
authentication performance.

105
00:08:52,055 --> 00:08:56,675
So on high performance authentication
systems, deliver exceptional

106
00:08:56,885 --> 00:09:03,345
reliability, with 99.5% successful
verification rates while maintaining

107
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:09,705
rapid sub hundred millisecond response
time for seamless user experience.

108
00:09:10,205 --> 00:09:15,385
When it comes to compliance monitoring,
advanced distributed monitoring

109
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:21,045
capabilities handle thousand events
per second in real time, maintaining

110
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:28,355
95 per 95% accuracy, and, compliance
verification across all regulated

111
00:09:28,805 --> 00:09:31,895
frameworks and internal policies.

112
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:40,375
So realtime security, enforcement
processes, thousand or 10,000, compliance,

113
00:09:40,615 --> 00:09:47,675
rules simultaneously identifying, and
flagging violations within 2.5 seconds

114
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:52,670
to enable immediate, corrective action
and maintain continuous compliance.

115
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,880
Performance considerations.

116
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,140
So latency management, network
latency, in distribution systems

117
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:09,385
includes trans transmission delay
of 0.0 4.42, 3.3 millisecond.

118
00:10:09,885 --> 00:10:17,695
Prop delays between, 0.5 milliseconds

per no, querying delays 5 2 50

120
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,640
milliseconds, about 80% utilization.

121
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,450
Processing or optimization.

122
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:35,780
Adaptive resource management systems
maintains the, stable performance

123
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:42,170
when processing load varies between
42 80, 80 5% of maximum capacity.

124
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,510
Optimal resource utilization is
achieved when processing tasks are

125
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,090
distributor distributed across.

126
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:56,420
For both, computational and bandwidth
resources, scalable patterns,

127
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,490
system, implementing dynamic
resource, allocation can achieve

128
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,890
25% better resource utilization.

129
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:09,180
Then static allocation
approaches, maintaining resource

130
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,555
utilization between 60 to 80%.

131
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:17,380
provides an optimal balance between
performance and scalability, monitoring

132
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,680
and, observation, observa variability.

133
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,680
One is, when it comes to system health
monitoring, machine learning based

134
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:32,930
