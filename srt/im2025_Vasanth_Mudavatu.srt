1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,120
In this session, we'll explore the
need for transparency of intelligent

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,580
AI systems and how to strengthen AI
driven incident management to reshape

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,530
enterprise strategy and impact.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,820
Let's dive in.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,120
So we are gonna look into why transparency
is critical for AI incident management,

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,150
and what is the urgency, how do you
build trust, and what are the key

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,250
pillars for algorithmic transparency?

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:34,530
A couple of real world examples and
we'll deep dive into the framework

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,240
for implementing transparency and
the strategies and how do you measure

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,710
the success and impact of this
framework, and then open dialogue,

11
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:44,840
the challenge.

12
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,730
So what is the challenge here?

13
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:53,420
So how can we trust AI systems
whose decisions could be biased?

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,609
These days, the AI systems
are no longer just assisting.

15
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,059
They are the frontline
commanding officers.

16
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:06,930
And as the influence of the
AI systems surges, a critical

17
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,060
challenge looms for security teams.

18
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,039
And how do we trust, how do we trust the
decisions being made by these AI systems

19
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:19,219
For us, especially when the AI algorithms
are tasked with making split second.

20
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,874
Mission critical judgments.

21
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:26,024
It could be catastrophic,
but to breach our defenses.

22
00:01:26,114 --> 00:01:30,794
So this vulnerability can escalate
minor anomalies into a full

23
00:01:30,794 --> 00:01:32,684
blown organizational crisis.

24
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:37,894
So beyond just compliance, the
transparency isn't just a best

25
00:01:37,894 --> 00:01:41,734
practice, it is the bedrock
of operational effectiveness.

26
00:01:42,234 --> 00:01:46,704
It actively forges the
resiliency essential for today's

27
00:01:46,894 --> 00:01:49,354
critical security operations.

28
00:01:49,854 --> 00:01:51,414
Let's unveil the urgency here.

29
00:01:52,074 --> 00:01:54,324
Why the transparency is non-negotiable.

30
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,174
The three main reasons.

31
00:01:56,264 --> 00:02:01,454
One is relentless cyber threats,
stringent regulatory mandates and

32
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,254
catastrophic operational risks.

33
00:02:03,754 --> 00:02:04,954
The AI space is.

34
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:06,559
Continuously evolving.

35
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:10,999
And every day we are noticing a
sophisticated, say, cyber threats.

36
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:15,459
And it is morphing with
unprecedented speed, right?

37
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:20,730
So to build an impenetrable defense
system, security teams desperately

38
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,760
need powerful, transparent, and
verifiable AI solution, not just the

39
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,810
algorithms, then the regulatory mandates.

40
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,570
So across the pivotal sectors like
financial services, the regulatory

41
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:39,970
bodies are no longer suggesting they
are mandating transparent AI decisions.

42
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,550
The organizations must proactively
demonstrate the explainability to

43
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:51,010
effort penalties, and safeguard their
operational licenses and public trust

44
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,000
and catastrophic operational risks
in the moment of critical incident.

45
00:02:56,795 --> 00:02:59,045
Response time is not just money.

46
00:02:59,735 --> 00:03:03,845
It is the difference between
containment and catastrophic.

47
00:03:04,805 --> 00:03:09,935
The inherent opacity of black box
AI introduces dangerous hesitation,

48
00:03:10,235 --> 00:03:14,915
crippling rapid decision making, and
transforming nascent threats into a

49
00:03:14,915 --> 00:03:17,255
full balloon organizational crisis.

50
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:21,040
So let's unveil the
transparency framework.

51
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:28,565
What are the pillars that will illuminate
the journey of AI from being a black

52
00:03:28,565 --> 00:03:32,495
box to a verifiable trustworthy system?

53
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:35,605
There are four pillars, so
let's talk about the pillar

54
00:03:35,605 --> 00:03:37,585
one, which is explainability.

55
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:42,235
It's a stakeholder explanation strategy
that occurs at multiple levels.

56
00:03:43,105 --> 00:03:47,695
So this approach ensures all
stakeholders understand AI decisions.

57
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:52,230
AI Decisions made by AI Executive Summary.

58
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,110
This summary provides a strategic
insights giving the leaders a high level

59
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,170
overview of AI implications and its risks.

60
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,300
The analyst detail covers the
key features, importance, and

61
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,140
specific decision pathways, and
supports a detailed analysis.

62
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,660
The technical deep dive, it examines
the AI model, weight weights, and the

63
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,850
algorithmic logic and offer complete
transparency for technical experts.

64
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,210
These tailored explanations will
help build trust and ensure users

65
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:34,970
understand the reasoning behind the AI
decisions and when and how they need it.

66
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,150
Pillar two, it's accountability.

67
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:43,440
Granular attribution, so we should be
able to pinpoint exact data inputs,

68
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,850
model components, and algorithmic
pathways for each air decision.

69
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,745
This provides transparency into the why
behind every outcome, empower, oversight.

70
00:04:56,245 --> 00:05:00,594
We should equip human operators
with the real time insights and

71
00:05:00,594 --> 00:05:05,485
escalation protocols to intervene
swiftly when AI confidence drops

72
00:05:05,985 --> 00:05:08,895
or when an anomaly is detected.

73
00:05:09,765 --> 00:05:14,565
So this will ensure that the
human control is critical.

74
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,535
And number three is immutable.

75
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,080
Auditability.

76
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:23,010
We one should preserve a comprehensive
tamper proof record of all AI decisions,

77
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:29,550
including inputs, outputs, and human
interventions, creating an unalterable

78
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,540
chain of custody for regulatory
adherence and forensic analysis.

79
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,990
Pillar three is bias mitigation.

80
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,265
How do you enrich training data?

81
00:05:38,765 --> 00:05:42,784
We should curate the representative
data sets to eliminate blind spots

82
00:05:42,905 --> 00:05:44,495
and detect all cyber threats.

83
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:49,914
Real time monitoring to neutralize
emerging bias patterns in live

84
00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:55,405
models and rigorous fairness metrics
to implement objective metrics,

85
00:05:55,944 --> 00:05:59,484
to validate threat assessments and
ensure equitable response actions.

86
00:06:00,384 --> 00:06:03,744
Unchecked AI bias creates
dangerous blind spots.

87
00:06:04,314 --> 00:06:05,275
It leads to.

88
00:06:05,775 --> 00:06:10,275
Overlooking threats and false positives,
but this will compromise operational

89
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:16,035
integrity, erodes trust, and jeopardizes
swift accurate incident resolution.

90
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:18,215
Pillar four is auditability.

91
00:06:18,515 --> 00:06:24,635
So in the current complex landscape of
AI driven cybersecurity, auditability

92
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,735
is not just a best practice.

93
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:32,750
It's a foundational pillar for maintaining
trust, ensuring accountability, and

94
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,260
enabling rapid informed incident response.

95
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,240
It allows organizations to
understand, verify, and explain every

96
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,100
decision made by the AI systems.

97
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,460
So let's dig deep into this a little bit.

98
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:52,080
So transparent decision journeys so
clearly trace every AI decision from

99
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,690
initial input to the final recommendation.

100
00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:01,310
In an incident, understanding why an
AI flagged something or missed a threat

101
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,450
is paramount for quickly reconstructing
it throughout this thought process,

102
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:10,790
and that helps identify root causes
and validate legitimate alerts.

103
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:16,520
It also prevents wastage of resources
or an oversight of a catastrophic

104
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,790
incident effective model version.

105
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,220
Use robust version control to track
all model verifications and assess

106
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,750
their impact on the outcomes.

107
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:31,330
So the ability to roll back to a previous
stable model version is critical.

108
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,870
And whenever there is an update, it
could introduce vulnerabilities, so

109
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:41,680
performance regressions, or it could
increase the false positives and thus

110
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,570
minimizing the exposure to new threats.

111
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,510
So the effective model
versioning is critical.

112
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:52,050
Automated compliance reports automate
the generation of comprehensive audit

113
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:58,510
reports is on AI model performance,
bias detection, incident response logs,

114
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,700
decision traces, and version histories.

115
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:05,170
Post incident reviews are streamlined
with the readily available reports,

116
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,820
providing critical evidences
for forensic investigations, and

117
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,380
demonstrating due diligence in
adhering to security policies.

118
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,030
Those are the four pillars of
the transparency framework.

119
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,640
Let's look at a real world impact.

120
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,950
Let's focus on critical
infrastructure, so power grids, right?

121
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:29,060
The transparent AI empowers
operators to swiftly pinpoint

122
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,790
network anomalies, significantly
accelerating threat validation.

123
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,920
This rapid detection is vital for
averting widespread disruptions

124
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,540
and maintaining grid stability.

125
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,480
Safeguarding a water treat water
treatment explainable algorithms

126
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,280
deliver unparalleled forensic precision,
unmasking, subtle and malicious

127
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,800
control patterns with scatter systems.

128
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,150
This ensures the integrity of
essential public health infrastructure

129
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,600
revolutionizing transit systems.

130
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,460
Clear AI reasoning optimizes
the collaboration among

131
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,405
security teams expediting.

132
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,420
Incident response and fortifying
risk mitigation against complex

133
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:14,130
multi-vector cyber incidents,
thereby ensuring commuter safety and

134
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,755
operational community unlocking trust.

135
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:21,275
Our AI transparency framework
starts with a strategic assessment.

136
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:26,355
One should evaluate the current
AI systems, identify gaps.

137
00:09:26,855 --> 00:09:30,515
Transparency, the lack of
transparency and the compliance needs.

138
00:09:31,475 --> 00:09:33,965
It's purposefully secure by design.

139
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:40,275
So the architect explainable AI models
embed accountability mechanisms into

140
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:42,765
the design and seamless integration.

141
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:48,495
So deploy these AI solutions seamlessly
into the current tool set and implement

142
00:09:48,495 --> 00:09:53,385
monitoring and feedback systems for
insights continuous optimization.

143
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,250
Refine the AI transparency features.

144
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:01,440
Use the feedback, operational feedback
to drive improvement and innovation.

145
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,970
How do you overcome
implementation challenges?

146
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,390
So we have to protect the
intellectual property.

147
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,770
The challenge is balancing
the AI model transparency with

148
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,590
proprietary algorithmic protection.

149
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:20,130
One way we can work on the challenge is
to use layered explanations to provide

150
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,370
insights without revealing sensitive ip.

151
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,640
Second challenge is how do you
balance the performance and interop?

152
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,060
Interop, interpretability, reconciling
the need for high detection accuracy with

153
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,250
the demand for clear expecta explanations.

154
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,485
So for this, we can deploy a hybrid
architecture that combines high

155
00:10:38,485 --> 00:10:43,095
performance models with dedicated
interpretability modules adapting

156
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:47,955
to new threats, challenge, ensuring
transparent models remain effective

157
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:54,725
and resilient against evoking, evolving
attack Vectors solution is implement

158
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:58,805
continuous learning frameworks to
strengthen model defenses with.

159
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,130
Persevering transparency.

160
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,280
How do you measure transparency?

161
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:10,360
Success of transparency Before faster
fos, faster triage, the explainable

162
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,110
AI significantly accelerates
incident classification, allowing

163
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,000
security teams to respond quickly.

164
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,730
Analyst confidence, the security
professionals that trust AI

165
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,810
recommendations more when
transparency substantially clarifies

166
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,160
the decision making process.

167
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,350
Improved coordination.

168
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,430
Transparent AI decisions
dramatically enhance cross team

169
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:36,960
collaboration, streaming efforts
and speeding up strategic responses.

170
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,120
Reduce false positives.

171
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:45,000
Explainable model helps analysts
quickly validate, estimate activities

172
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:50,070
significantly, reduce distractions and
optimizing, optimize the resources.

173
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,680
What is a path forward?

174
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,550
So cultivate trust
through AI transparency.

175
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,870
So the effective incident
response isn't about choosing

176
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,700
between human expertise and ai.

177
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,660
It is about how seamlessly
they are integrated together.

178
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,280
'cause that collaboration should
be transparent and empowers

179
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,140
empowering the humans in the loop.

180
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,020
The organizations embrace.

181
00:12:14,755 --> 00:12:19,315
Transparency of algorithms isn't
just to prepare for the future,

182
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:23,725
it is to build a strong security
posture for the organization.

183
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:27,475
This commitment offers clear advantages.

184
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:30,085
The response time will become faster.

185
00:12:30,355 --> 00:12:35,150
A regulatory compliance will be
met and confident security teams.

186
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,600
What are the key takeaways
from the session?

187
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,660
So prioritizing AI
transparency is critical.

188
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:47,190
How do you empower human AI synergy
and realize a algorithmic advantages

189
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,160
integrate for resilient security?

190
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:55,730
Prioritizing AI transparency is
ground AI in incident management with

191
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,640
unwavering explainability, fairness
and accountability, and improve the

192
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,370
collaboration between AI and humans.

193
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:09,260
Is to elevate the incident response
efficiency and realizing the advantages of

194
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:14,930
algorithmic transparency is to accelerate
response times, guarantee regulatory

195
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:20,020
compliance, and build high confidence
security teams integrating for resilience.

196
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:25,060
Security unifies human AI
capabilities to construct a robust

197
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,475
future proof security posture.

198
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:28,215
Hope.

199
00:13:28,215 --> 00:13:31,305
Hope we have learned about the
incident management, AI driven

200
00:13:31,305 --> 00:13:35,955
incident management, and the need
for transparency in those systems.

201
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:36,945
Thanks so much.
