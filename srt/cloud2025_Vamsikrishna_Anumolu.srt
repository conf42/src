1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,739
Hello all, so let me introduce myself.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:07,839
so I have overall 15 years of IT industry
experience with a robust background

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,940
across financial technology, digital
marketing and automobile sectors.

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,659
I excel in platform engineering,
reliability engineering and DevSecOps

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,610
SaaS operations and service delivery.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,990
My expertise includes multi, Tenant
SaaS applications and cloud native

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:32,050
microservices and streaming data platforms
complex event processing, event stream

8
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:36,099
processing and cyber security Like
today we are stepping into the future of

9
00:00:36,099 --> 00:00:40,819
fleet management, where transformative
technologies are reshaping, the way manage

10
00:00:40,849 --> 00:00:45,649
and operation operate vehicle fleets with
the integration of artificial intelligence

11
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:47,799
and the internet of things and Kubernetes.

12
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:52,829
We unlock new possibility of
efficiency and safety fleet

13
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,179
management is the process of managing.

14
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:57,499
let me introduce about
What is fleet management?

15
00:00:57,499 --> 00:01:01,969
Fleet management is the process of
managing a company's vehicles and

16
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,369
assets through their life cycle.

17
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:09,729
The goal is to improve efficiency and
reduce cost and increase performance.

18
00:01:09,749 --> 00:01:14,099
The fleet care, fleet management
itself like Itself introduced

19
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,329
is a process of improving the
efficiency and cost and performance.

20
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:24,519
how about integrating AI, like AI and,
IOT along with this fleet management

21
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:27,939
and along with the Kubernetes, like
cloud native solutions like Kubernetes.

22
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:31,939
So picture, like in a picture of
world where AI predicts maintenance

23
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:37,129
needs before issue rises and IOT
optimizes routes in real time and

24
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:39,499
Kubernetes scales operations seamlessly.

25
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:44,659
This convergence can reduce, reduce
operational cost by, up to 30

26
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:47,779
percent improve vehicle reliability
and enhance driver safety.

27
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,660
so let's deep dive into this actually.

28
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,590
so let's deep dive into that, it actually.

29
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,629
So So, how AI is transforming
fleet management?

30
00:01:57,639 --> 00:02:01,219
if you see the, the current, diagram,
and if you see that, you have the company

31
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:05,099
vehicles, let's say if you have a,
ambulances, or, maybe, a trucks, like a

32
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:08,909
company will be having trucks, and, the
companies will be having, companies like

33
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,740
Uber, A any other, any, carpet companies,
having their own vehicles, so what happens

34
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,630
is, like we need to, obviously like com,
fleet manage manager, like fleet managers

35
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:22,040
should able to, see the dashboards,
like what's going on, what's going on,

36
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,720
with the tire pressures and, vehicle,
tire, tire pressures as well as fuel and

37
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,259
certain things like a fuel and maintenance
like, they have in the dashboards.

38
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:35,909
So based on that they will try to take
the decisions of buying the new vehicles

39
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:40,709
or do the maintenance and improve
proactive performance measures So we

40
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:43,499
should see in the dashboards actually,
you know We should see what's going in

41
00:02:43,499 --> 00:02:47,249
the dashboards and we should get an alerts
actually that's how it is right now when

42
00:02:47,429 --> 00:02:53,659
it comes to like how AI is Revolution
in this whole process, so artificial

43
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:59,069
AI is revolutionary revolutionizing
We how we manage optimized vehicles.

44
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:03,529
So through advanced Learning
algorithms and predictive analysis.

45
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:10,419
So AI enables decision making automobiles
complex operation task The transformation

46
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:15,929
is helping fleet managers to reduce
costs and improve safety and maximize

47
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:18,569
efficiency At an unprecedented, scale.

48
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:24,479
So it's, so what, it's more of because
of algorithms, predictor, by using AI and

49
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:30,109
predictor, AI with predictor algorithms,
we can easily, we can, we can easily, we

50
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:34,419
can, we can simplify the decision making
and, and automate any complex tasks.

51
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:39,319
so this is about like how, AI
transforming fleet management and,

52
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,389
next coming to the next slide.

53
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:43,574
so how, So due to the rise
of, fleet management, there

54
00:03:43,574 --> 00:03:44,504
are two things are happening.

55
00:03:44,504 --> 00:03:47,494
One is a predictive maintenance and
other thing is, efficiency boost.

56
00:03:47,734 --> 00:03:51,694
So when it comes to predictive
maintenance, a drives advanced,

57
00:03:51,724 --> 00:03:55,384
advancements in, predictive
maintenance and reducing vehicle

58
00:03:55,384 --> 00:03:58,564
downtime by at least 40% and advanced.

59
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:02,789
and advanced algorithms analyze the
engine data to forecast potential

60
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,879
issues before it even occurs.

61
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,039
So that's a big, that,
that's a big, big thing.

62
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,869
that, that really big thing when it
comes to the, vehicle maintenance.

63
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:13,299
It's and again, it, coming to
the efficiency boost AI overall.

64
00:04:13,974 --> 00:04:18,054
operational effi, improve the operational
efficiency with organizations experience

65
00:04:18,054 --> 00:04:23,134
improving, improvements of around 30
percent and smart systems optimizes

66
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:27,274
routes, schedules and, resource
allocation real time, like smart systems

67
00:04:27,474 --> 00:04:31,754
such as like IOT devices are going
to optimize the routes and, schedules

68
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:33,484
and resource allocation real time.

69
00:04:33,814 --> 00:04:35,764
So this is really, big change.

70
00:04:36,264 --> 00:04:39,254
so IOT internet of, IOT means
like internet of things.

71
00:04:39,254 --> 00:04:43,724
So how it is, so which is really useful
in real time tracking and monitoring.

72
00:04:44,154 --> 00:04:47,674
IOT provides three things,
like one is enhanced safety and

73
00:04:47,674 --> 00:04:51,294
another one is transparency and
third one is risk reduction.

74
00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:57,124
So when it comes to enhanced safety,
IOT enables real time tracking of

75
00:04:57,424 --> 00:04:59,824
vehicles and condition, and condition.

76
00:05:00,194 --> 00:05:04,604
Monitoring enhancing of, fleet safety
and they're coming to say transparency.

77
00:05:05,574 --> 00:05:09,234
IOT enabled sensors offer
increased transparency.

78
00:05:09,234 --> 00:05:13,214
This provides a clear view of
fleet operations and it comes to

79
00:05:13,214 --> 00:05:14,744
the third thing, a risk reduction.

80
00:05:14,744 --> 00:05:19,244
Like now companies using IOT reporting
25 percent decrease in risks.

81
00:05:19,624 --> 00:05:21,914
This is due to enhanced
monitoring and data.

82
00:05:22,414 --> 00:05:27,114
. And, let's, coming to the, third, third
key component, which is a Kubernetes.

83
00:05:27,114 --> 00:05:30,124
So like in Kubernetes, how,
how Kubernetes, powering modern

84
00:05:30,124 --> 00:05:31,534
fleet management infrastructure.

85
00:05:31,534 --> 00:05:37,054
So we, because we need infrastructure
in, IT we need infrastructure and a for

86
00:05:37,324 --> 00:05:39,429
running ai, predictor, fleet management.

87
00:05:39,429 --> 00:05:43,469
We need, so we need it in edge
computing for which is essential.

88
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:48,139
E even in, essentially in even in a
fleet management right now, so how

89
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:51,929
fleet care, how a Kubernetes is,
revolutionizing this whole process,

90
00:05:51,929 --> 00:05:56,449
it is, using, so if you see, so what
Kubernetes is doing, it's an underlying,

91
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,369
key backbone of all these things, so
because if, backbone of these things,

92
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:04,359
so what it is providing So Kubernetes
provides a central, containerization

93
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:08,839
and resource management capabilities for
robust, robust fleet management systems.

94
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:12,009
And, and, second thing, it
comes like automated deployment.

95
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:16,729
See, so Kubernetes, provides seamless
scaling, automated deployment of

96
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:21,409
applications and microservices for real
time data processing, which is for IoT.

97
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:26,499
And third thing, resource optimization,
and has the resource utilization and

98
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:28,189
efficiency management of computing.

99
00:06:28,664 --> 00:06:31,574
Resources for AI and IoT operation.

100
00:06:31,964 --> 00:06:35,874
And the third thing is it provides
security and flexibility, flexibilities.

101
00:06:36,304 --> 00:06:40,414
so when it comes to security and
flexibility, it isolates environments

102
00:06:40,414 --> 00:06:42,584
with an multi environment support.

103
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:48,339
Like a cloud on prem hybrid for secure and
adaptable operation, which is very key in

104
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:53,859
fleet care management So when it comes to
the scalability kubernetes allows seamless

105
00:06:53,859 --> 00:06:58,469
scaling of application microservices
that process large volumes of iot data

106
00:06:58,804 --> 00:07:03,184
In real time, it's really like IOT data
is the key for a fleet management and

107
00:07:03,194 --> 00:07:09,884
to get the a real time data Of a vehicle
so and when it comes to the deployment

108
00:07:09,894 --> 00:07:15,064
it can automate deploy kubernetes can
automate deployment Scaling operations

109
00:07:15,074 --> 00:07:19,624
in fleet management ensuring that
updates and new features are continuously

110
00:07:19,634 --> 00:07:24,124
integrated and delivered and also
Kubernetes provides resource efficiency.

111
00:07:24,124 --> 00:07:30,164
Kubernetes enhances resource utilization
by effectively managing computer

112
00:07:30,254 --> 00:07:35,294
resources essential for processing
AI models and handling IoT data.

113
00:07:35,884 --> 00:07:38,654
And the fourth thing is
isolation and security.

114
00:07:39,044 --> 00:07:42,334
With its containerization feature,
Kubernetes provides isolation

115
00:07:42,334 --> 00:07:46,714
environments for different applications,
enhancing security and reliability.

116
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:48,194
And flexibility.

117
00:07:48,194 --> 00:07:49,674
It supports various environments.

118
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:55,749
such as cloud, on prem hybrid and making
it adaptable, changing data processing

119
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:59,119
and AI requirements in fleet management.

120
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:03,389
In summary, Kubernetes serves as a
backbone for deploying and maintaining

121
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:08,909
robust, scalable, and efficient systems
necessary for the dynamic field of

122
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:11,339
IoT and AI driven fleet management.

123
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,699
And coming to the success story
of AI predicting, breakdowns.

124
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:18,919
So transform, transformative
AI integration.

125
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:22,869
Our cutting, like cutting edging,
our cutting edge, machine, system

126
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,809
revolutionized fleet management by
processing an unprecedented, 500, 000

127
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:32,839
data points from real time vehicle
sensors, comprehensive engine diagnostics,

128
00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:34,789
and detailed maintenance history.

129
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:39,524
Histories to spot emerging
mecha, mechanical issues before

130
00:08:39,904 --> 00:08:41,754
they become, critical failures.

131
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:45,094
And second thing is game
changing predictive power.

132
00:08:45,114 --> 00:08:49,344
By harnessing the power of advanced
algorithms, the system delivered

133
00:08:49,384 --> 00:08:53,664
an enhanced 90 percent success in
forecasting mechanical failures

134
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:55,849
two weeks before they occurred.

135
00:08:56,169 --> 00:09:00,739
This breakthrough enabled fleet managers
to schedule maintenance strategically,

136
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:05,399
virtually, eliminating unexpected
breakdowns and their associated costs.

137
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,499
And third thing is
dramatic financial impact.

138
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:10,459
The result, spoke volumes.

139
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:15,359
Like organization deploying this AI
solution captured an average of 2.

140
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:17,489
3 million in annual savings.

141
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:21,539
The, the gains came from eliminating
emergency repair premiums.

142
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:26,779
Strategical, scheduling maintenance during
off peak hours and maximizing vehicle

143
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:29,919
uptime enhanced fleet productivity.

144
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:34,059
Another success story, like
IOT, like about IOT, like how

145
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:36,039
IOT improving fuel efficiency.

146
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:38,559
So one is like a vehicle, diagnostics.

147
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,249
And second thing is fuel savings.

148
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:42,819
And third thing is a
sustainable operations.

149
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:46,609
So when it comes to the vehicle
diagnostics, real time IOT sensors

150
00:09:46,869 --> 00:09:51,029
monitored, engine performance,
deliver, behavior and routing

151
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:55,319
efficiency and leading to, data driven
optimization of fleet operations.

152
00:09:55,944 --> 00:09:57,544
And then coming to the fuel savings.

153
00:09:57,894 --> 00:10:01,854
Implementation resulted 20 percent
improvements in fuel efficiency,

154
00:10:02,274 --> 00:10:08,614
saving an average of 150, 000 annually
per, vehicle, per 100 vehicles

155
00:10:08,614 --> 00:10:10,204
while reducing maintenance costs.

156
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:14,324
And, the third thing is,
reduce sustainable operation.

157
00:10:14,324 --> 00:10:18,924
Reduce carbon emissions by 20
25%, equivalent to removing 50

158
00:10:18,924 --> 00:10:20,974
percent cars from road annually.

159
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:25,889
while meeting, stringent environment
compliance standards and coming

160
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:28,549
to the success story of Kubernetes
scaling operations when it comes

161
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:29,649
to the fleet care management.

162
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:33,979
seamless deployment, one is seamless
deployment and second one is scalability

163
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:35,689
and third one is reliability.
