00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,650
Today, we'll explore how modern
technologies scalability,

8
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,009
compliance, cybersecurity, and
how these innovations are shaping

9
00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:28,290
the future of healthcare delivery.

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,969
The healthcare cloud computing market
is experiencing an unprecedented

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,209
growth, currently valued at 51.

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:42,119
47 billion, and it's projected
to nearly triple 239.

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,489
68 billion by 2029.

14
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:47,900
This growth is driven by the rapid
adoption of digital solutions,

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,200
particularly in North America, which
leads in innovation and implementation.

16
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:58,050

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,880
This shift is not just about technology.

20
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:13,110
It's about fundamentally transforming how
healthcare is delivered and experienced.

21
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,500
The scale of healthcare data management.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,190
Healthcare organizations are
dealing with an explosion of data.

23
00:01:20,925 --> 00:01:24,225
On average, they manage 259.

24
00:01:24,515 --> 00:01:30,335
2 terabytes of patient data annually
with larger hospital networks

25
00:01:30,805 --> 00:01:33,974
processing up to 665 terabytes.

26
00:01:33,975 --> 00:01:38,715
This data comes in many forms, structured
patient records, unstructured clinical

27
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:43,375
notes, high resolution medical images, and
real time monitoring data of IoT devices.

28
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:46,095
A lot of other, ways of, During the data.

29
00:01:46,425 --> 00:01:50,745
However, the challenge is that data
generation is outpacing storage

30
00:01:50,755 --> 00:01:53,485
capacity growth by 25 percent annually.

31
00:01:54,015 --> 00:01:57,295
This creates a pressing need for scalable,
efficient data management solutions.

32
00:01:57,795 --> 00:02:03,365
Without addressing this issue, healthcare
organizations risk being overwhelmed

33
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:09,435
by the sheer volume of data they
need to store, process, and analyze.

34
00:02:09,935 --> 00:02:12,325
Let's talk about cybersecurity
challenges in healthcare.

35
00:02:12,825 --> 00:02:16,935
Cybersecurity is one of the most critical
challenges facing healthcare today.

36
00:02:17,435 --> 00:02:23,735
On average, 1, 285 attempted
cyberattacks every week.

37
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:27,894
Ransomware attacks have
seen a dramatic 94.

38
00:02:27,894 --> 00:02:33,155
3 percent increase 94 percent surge this
year, forcing hospitals to make impossible

39
00:02:33,155 --> 00:02:36,715
choices between paying criminals or
risking disruption to patient care.

40
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:39,245
The financial impact is staggering.

41
00:02:39,315 --> 00:02:45,025
In 2023, the average cost of a data
breach in healthcare reached 10.

42
00:02:45,105 --> 00:02:48,255
93 million, the highest
across all industries.

43
00:02:48,755 --> 00:02:50,365
But this isn't just about money.

44
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:54,165
Cybersecurity is a patient safety issue.

45
00:02:54,545 --> 00:02:59,315
A breach can compromise sensitive patient
data, disrupt critical medical systems.

46
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,530
And even put lives at risk.

47
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,670
Healthcare organizations must
prioritize cyber security as a

48
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,270
fundamental component of patient care.

49
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,790
Implementing comprehensive
different strategies to protect

50
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,330
both data and human lives.

51
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,000
If we talk about the compliance
requirements, compliance is another major

52
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,060
challenge for healthcare organizations.

53
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,020
They must navigate a complex web of
regulations, including HIPAA in the

54
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,520
U. S., GDPR in Europe, and various
local and state specific laws.

55
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,780
To maintain compliance, healthcare
institutions invest approximately

56
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,590
15 percent of their IT budgets into
activities like staff training, security

57
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,880
infrastructure, and regular audits.

58
00:03:35,785 --> 00:03:41,228
For mid sized hospitals, this translates
to an average annual investment of 3.

59
00:03:41,228 --> 00:03:43,625
8 million in compliance management.

60
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:47,435
This includes costs for documentation,
documentation systems, dedicated

61
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:50,685
compliance officers, ongoing staff
certifications, and external audits.

62
00:03:51,235 --> 00:03:54,515
While compliance is costly, it's
essential for protecting patient

63
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:59,165
privacy and avoiding significant
legal and financial penalties.

64
00:03:59,165 --> 00:03:59,554
Likewise,

65
00:04:00,054 --> 00:04:04,554
many healthcare organizations are
still grappling with outdated systems.

66
00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:09,009
76 percent of healthcare
institutions operate with systems

67
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:10,569
that are over 10 years old.

68
00:04:11,179 --> 00:04:14,429
These legacy systems are
not only inefficient, but

69
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:15,859
also expensive to maintain.

70
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:19,449
Annual maintenance costs exceed 8.

71
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,169
3 billion across the U. S.

72
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:23,099
healthcare sector.

73
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:26,049
They also cause significant downtime.

74
00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:31,139
On average, healthcare providers
experience 32 hours of downtime

75
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,619
annually, which can disrupt
patient care and operations.

76
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:39,639
Perhaps most concerning is that
legacy systems consume 60 to 80

77
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:44,949
percent of IT budgets just for
maintenance, leaving little room

78
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:46,609
for innovation and modernization.

79
00:04:47,109 --> 00:04:50,379
This highlights the urgent need
for healthcare organizations to

80
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,739
transition to more modern, scalable,
and efficient data architectures.

81
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:59,489
Now let's talk about the modern
solutions, like the data lakes, federated

82
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:02,269
learning, these are revolutionizing
the healthcare data management.

00:05:02,894 --> 00:05:08,844
Data lakes enabled real time access
to diverse medical data sources from

84
00:05:08,844 --> 00:05:11,194
patient records to imaging data.

85
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:16,414
This integration has led to 47 percent
improvement in clinical decision

86
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:21,294
support accuracy and reduced complex
query times from days to just hours.

87
00:05:21,794 --> 00:05:26,414
Federated learning takes this a
step further by enabling secure

88
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:31,334
collaboration across institutions
without transferring sensitive data.

89
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:38,659
This approach Reduces data transfer volume
by 91 percent or up to about 92 percent

90
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,899
ensuring patient privacy while still
allowing for advanced AI driven insights.

91
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:48,299
