00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,080
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:07,340
My name is, I have t years of experience
in Enterprise Cloud technologies with

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,440
a strong focus on data engineering
analytics and I also have the more than

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,090
15 years of deep industry expertise
working across various sectors to drive

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,810
innovation, performance, and value
through the data driven solutions.

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,865
Today we are going to talk about that.

7
00:00:23,365 --> 00:00:26,455
Data services and below the
topics we are going to cover,

8
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,265
let's move to agenda Today.

9
00:00:29,415 --> 00:00:34,475
We'll expose some of the key challenges
enterprise face in modern integration

10
00:00:34,475 --> 00:00:36,605
with a special focus on SAP system.

11
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:40,845
We'll drive into the SAP World
Data Services for examine how,

12
00:00:40,845 --> 00:00:44,265
what data are transforming
integration by enabling seamless

13
00:00:44,265 --> 00:00:47,325
data exchange across the platforms.

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,880
In this scenario, we will look
at the performance optimization

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,190
techniques, explore real world case
studies, and discuss how mobile

16
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,260
and the third party integrations
are driving greater efficiency and

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,910
adoption across the industries.

18
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,310
Let's move on to the next one.

19
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:08,630
For modern enterprise integration
challenges, large augmentation often

20
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,600
operate across five to 15 distinct
systems are more than that one.

21
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,550
With every new system added
complexity does not just

22
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,130
increase, it grows exponentially.

23
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,490
Create what researchers
call integration depth.

24
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,680
Some of the common challenges included
middleware dependency, which drives

25
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,375
up cost to heterogeneous environment,
massive data volumes that create

26
00:01:32,395 --> 00:01:36,350
the bottlenecks at the interface
boundaries, pushing performance

27
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,990
recommend to the limit security weakness.

28
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:44,020
Explicitly when exposing sens or
high confidential data to the modern

29
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,330
cloud-based application complexity and
return data transformation as a different

30
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,925
system often represent the same business
concept in entirely different ways.

31
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:58,955
Integration method often lead
to what we call ity integration.

32
00:01:59,435 --> 00:02:03,995
The tangle, a fragile and expensive
web of connection that's become

33
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:05,735
harder to maintain over time.

34
00:02:06,515 --> 00:02:10,055
Let's move the next further integration
and distance aggression cycles.

35
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:15,025
Enterprises often move between cycle
of consultation and fragmentation

36
00:02:15,025 --> 00:02:17,095
driven by the evolving business needs.

37
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:19,110
According to the research by Lee and May.

38
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,690
Each new system added indication
pain point does not just increase.

39
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,670
They multiply creating,
escalating complexity across

40
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,720
the enterprise landscape.

41
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,480
In two days, always on economy,
that demand has shifted toward the

42
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,630
real time access to zero latency
or maybe with near zero latency.

43
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,929
Even small delays can impact decision
making, customer experience, and

44
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:46,820
overall operational efficiency.

45
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,810
With that one, the evaluation, SAP
integration Flats, SAP integration,

46
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,940
has gone through the several key stages
on over the time in the past or early,

47
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:03,140
early, SAP in the beginning of the custom
SAP web program and bad jobs were used.

48
00:03:04,025 --> 00:03:07,355
This work well for basis
needs, but lack of flexibility

49
00:03:07,745 --> 00:03:09,605
for in real time operations.

50
00:03:10,295 --> 00:03:11,165
Traditional integration.

51
00:03:11,165 --> 00:03:15,365
Next middleware layers and the
connectors were introduced with the

52
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:20,165
effective, with the cured specialized
expertise and often create silos.

53
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:21,395
Access systems.

54
00:03:21,895 --> 00:03:24,285
What data service error today?

55
00:03:24,285 --> 00:03:25,700
The data service presenter.

56
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:31,755
A major shift delivering restful,
standardized A PA overall STTP,

57
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:37,595
enabling seamless, scalable, and modern
integration platform first approach.

58
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:43,235
Finally, integration has evolved to
the platform first model where security

59
00:03:43,235 --> 00:03:48,035
scaling, more monitoring and error
handling, or managed centrally at

60
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:52,205
the platform level, not individually
at the error integration point.

61
00:03:52,705 --> 00:03:53,875
To move on the next slide.

62
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:56,635
The what Data Service
architecture Overview.

63
00:03:57,355 --> 00:04:02,845
What data Extend Rest principle to meet
the unique needs of SAP environments.

64
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:08,485
First, it use entity modeling that
aligns directly with SAP application

65
00:04:08,485 --> 00:04:12,715
layer, ensuring your natural fit
for enterprise data structures.

66
00:04:13,135 --> 00:04:16,495
Second, all data provides
metadata descriptions.

67
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:21,775
Making service, self-documenting and
easier for developers to understand

68
00:04:21,834 --> 00:04:28,915
and consume that it supports standard
CT P operations, including get post,

69
00:04:28,945 --> 00:04:33,235
put and delete, ensuring seamless
integration across modern applications.

70
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:38,350
Finally, what data definition can
consumed by third party application

71
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,960
while preserving rich business
semantics, enabling consistent

72
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,900
meaning and context across platform.

73
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,120
Let's talk about that benefit and
benefit of that water data approach.

74
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,670
Let's look at some of the key
benefits of the word data First.

75
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:01,960
Democratize data access operating
under the principle of connect once re

76
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:08,340
often reuse often, which significantly
improves efficiency and scalability.

77
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:15,515
Second, it reduce integrity complexity of
offering consistent interfaces, simplified

78
00:05:15,995 --> 00:05:21,960
security, and broad compatibility
through the JSN and Excel support that.

79
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:28,530
It takes a developer friendly approach
by using restful patents familiar to

80
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:33,270
most developer and align aligning closely
with the S-A-P-I-P first strategy.

81
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,820
Finally, all data brings strong
technical advantages, including

82
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,830
flexible querying and simplified entity
relationship model that can fully

83
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,020
leverage SAP HANA in memory patterns.

84
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,890
Let's talk about the performance
automations and techniques.

85
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,450
Scale performance in more that
is achieved through several

86
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,770
key optimization techniques.

87
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,050
Select filtering, selective filtering,
imagination support, response

88
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,720
to comparison, batch processing
filtering is this user server.

89
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,940
Site filtering which dollar filter
expression to only the what necessary,

90
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,360
and avoiding un unnecessary data loads.

91
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,280
Imagination support.

92
00:06:14,865 --> 00:06:18,375
Implemented using dollar skip
and dollar top parameters.

93
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:24,165
This ensure large data sets are
delivered in smaller, manageable chunks.

94
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:29,625
Response comparison, algorithm,
compass data payloads,

95
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:35,495
and significantly reduce bandwidth
usages, batch processing, multiple

96
00:06:35,555 --> 00:06:39,095
operation or consolidating into
the single call, minimizing network

97
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,165
power rate and improving efficiency.

98
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:47,600
With these techniques, response time
can drop to as low as 700 milliseconds

99
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,490
even for complex data scenarios.

100
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,060
Let's talk about a advantage
of automation techniques.

101
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,610
Let's move on the next topic.

102
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,900
Now let's focus on two advanced
automation techniques that take all

103
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,969
data performance to the next level.

104
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,719
Selective field projection,
delta core capabilities.

105
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:06,960
For the selector fields projection.

106
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:11,640
Using the store selection option, we
can retain only the recurred field

107
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,619
rather than that entire dataset.

108
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:18,289
This prevents unnecessary data
transfer and keeps payload size

109
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:21,499
minimal delta query capabilities.

110
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:26,509
This allows use to fetch only
the data that has changed since

111
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:27,919
the last synchronization point.

112
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:33,819
It's particularly valuable for the large
dataset with the frequent updates as

113
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:38,019
it is a significant reduced bandwidth
usage and improve significant efficiency.

114
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:43,359
Together these techniques ensure
faster performance and more scalable

115
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,599
integration, especially in the
data heavy interface environment.

116
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:51,149
And let's talk about the implementation
case studies and metrics.

117
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:56,119
This graph highlights the metrics across
key industry sectors, manufacturing,

118
00:07:56,179 --> 00:08:00,339
retail, financing, service, and
healthcare, showing the real world I

119
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:02,649
impact of the door data integration.

120
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:07,749
Case studies confirm several benefits,
reduce development, maintenance for

121
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:13,299
cost through the standardized, reusable
A ps, aps improved user satisfaction.

122
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,934
Faster response time and
smarter, smoother interaction.

123
00:08:18,434 --> 00:08:23,264
These results demonstrate how data
service are driving measurable efficiency

124
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:25,714
and business value across industries.

125
00:08:26,344 --> 00:08:28,654
Let's talk about the
industry specific benefits.

126
00:08:28,704 --> 00:08:33,624
In continuation with the previous
slide, let's now explore how modern

127
00:08:33,624 --> 00:08:37,554
integration delivers measurable
benefits across the various industries.

128
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:42,504
Manufacturing industries achieved
32 percentage fewer parts

129
00:08:42,504 --> 00:08:45,984
shortage through the real time
supply chain synchronization.

130
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:51,734
Retail industries improved inventory
accuracy from 82 to 98.5 percentage

131
00:08:51,734 --> 00:08:55,574
enabling better stock management
and customer satisfaction.

132
00:08:56,324 --> 00:09:02,024
Financial service enable faster compliance
and greater agility in launching the

133
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:07,864
new services healthcare providers, and
80% of reduction of integration relay

134
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:13,434
related data errors, ensuring better
patient care and operational efficiency.

135
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:19,329
And how we are going to connect with the
mobile, mobile and third part application

136
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:21,279
integration, the key feature of that one.

137
00:09:21,819 --> 00:09:24,729
Now let's look at the how
all data supports mobile

138
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:26,079
and third part integration.

139
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:31,329
All data are low SAP data to be
consumed directly by mobile application

140
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,119
using JS N and HCDP protocols.

141
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:41,499
This means we no longer rely on
S-A-B-G-A or legacy RFC based approaches.

142
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,589
Complexity and integration.

143
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:44,579
Integration overhead.

144
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:48,509
Additionally, the simplified
authentication and the seamless

145
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:53,699
data delivery significantly boost
user adoption, making the overall

146
00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:58,289
experience much more in-build and
efficiency for the business user

147
00:09:58,289 --> 00:10:00,559
and developers, mobile integration.

148
00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:02,539
Let's talk about the mobile
indication architecture.

149
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,899
Let's expose the mobile
index architecture.

150
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:09,549
This architecture follows your laid
approach, starting from the SAP

151
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:14,229
backend, exposing data through the old
data services, passing through that

152
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:18,669
robust security layer, and finally
reaching the mobile application.

153
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:24,589
Support mobile first strategies enabling
users to ex execute critical business

154
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:27,469
process beyond technical reports.

155
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:32,179
At the same time, it ensure strong
complaints and enterprise grade

156
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:35,899
security with non-negotiable
and modern IT landscape.

157
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,954
The key takeaways of the world of concept.

158
00:10:38,454 --> 00:10:40,949
To wrap up, let's summarize
the key takeaway from the

159
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:42,479
today's discussion on all data.

160
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,639
First, all data strikes the right balance
between SAP safety functionality, and

161
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:54,029
industry standard protocols making
its versatile enterprise integration.

162
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:58,979
Second, both the development and
maintenance effort are significantly

163
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,329
reduced, allowing team to focus on
developing business value rather than

164
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,829
the managing complex integration.

165
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:11,029
With the proper optimization, enterprise
grade is fully achievable, ensuring

166
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:12,829
variable and scalable operations.

167
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:17,869
Fourth, real world examples across
industries clearly demonstrate ever

168
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:19,909
efficiency, gain, and cost reduction.

169
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:24,919
And most importantly, more data
enables through digital transformation

170
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:30,019
seamlessly connecting SAP system
