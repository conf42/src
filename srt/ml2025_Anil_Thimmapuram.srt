00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,060
Hi.

2
00:00:00,839 --> 00:00:01,799
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,030
This is Anil Kumar.

4
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:09,390
I'm here to talk about 5G Infrastructure
Automation, and let me give you

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,100
a little bit intro about myself.

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,110
So I studied at Harrisburg
University, worked at Verizon, and

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,590
I'm currently working at United
Airlines as a DevOps engineer.

8
00:00:19,205 --> 00:00:25,555
Now when you hear of 5G most people
immediately think a faster Netflix

9
00:00:25,555 --> 00:00:30,385
or smoother Zoom calls and maybe one
or two dropped calls less, right?

10
00:00:30,385 --> 00:00:31,705
So it's all about 5G.

11
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:36,085
So I will let explain
something more about 5G today.

12
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:39,575
But what if we had told you we used 5G?

13
00:00:39,575 --> 00:00:45,615
Not to binge watch more tv, but to help
cities think we automated the traffic.

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,510
Include emergency response, even
made energy usage, more sustainable.

15
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:58,440
We gave cities a digital nervous system,
and today I'm walking you through, not in

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,425
theory, but real world deployed solution.

17
00:01:02,175 --> 00:01:09,435
You'll see how edge computing small cells,
automation, and gold, good old DevOps made

18
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:12,615
cities faster, smarter, cleaner, right?

19
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:17,595
So let's dive in The first section
of it it's a smart city problem.

20
00:01:18,255 --> 00:01:20,055
Let's go back to the straight point.

21
00:01:20,445 --> 00:01:26,205
The mass cities are now well complicated,
but their systems are way behind.

22
00:01:26,565 --> 00:01:30,975
Like when you compare, traffic
lights are like set on 2005 timers

23
00:01:30,975 --> 00:01:33,090
with the grid locks and all.

24
00:01:33,525 --> 00:01:37,875
All right, so like power grids
always on whether you need it or not.

25
00:01:38,235 --> 00:01:43,175
Emergency services like often routing
through traffic with no dynamic data,

26
00:01:43,175 --> 00:01:45,815
like when an ambulance is trying to go.

27
00:01:46,025 --> 00:01:49,415
So they just follow the GPS and
go and follow through the routes.

28
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:54,875
Which they gave one funny example,
in one city the traffic sys light

29
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:57,395
system couldn't be updated remotely.

30
00:01:57,695 --> 00:01:59,345
We had to send someone out.

31
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:05,695
But with the USB stick there, and
that's not outdated, that's prehistoric.

32
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:10,885
It wasn't just inefficient, it was
dangerous, wasteful and expensive.

33
00:02:10,885 --> 00:02:11,935
Need a manpower.

34
00:02:11,935 --> 00:02:16,495
We need a real time data driven
cities that where 5G and DevOps,

35
00:02:16,675 --> 00:02:20,055
that's where DevOps came in and
we come up with some strategy.

36
00:02:20,364 --> 00:02:20,964
Here.

37
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:23,289
The DevOps revolution, right?

38
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:27,609
So when I talk about the DevOps
revolution, so where DevOps meets

39
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:32,559
infrastructure, usually when you hear
right DevOps, you think deploying

40
00:02:32,589 --> 00:02:35,559
microservices, managing CICD, et cetera.

41
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:38,529
But we use the DevOps to deploy networks.

42
00:02:38,589 --> 00:02:43,659
Every router switch and edge
was defined as a code, like

43
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:45,789
an infrastructure as a code.

44
00:02:46,089 --> 00:02:49,839
We had terraform plants
that spun up 5G clusters.

45
00:02:50,845 --> 00:02:57,035
We did it in AWS hand charts configured
edge services, pipelines, auto tested

46
00:02:57,035 --> 00:02:59,975
latency, bandwidth, even failures.

47
00:03:00,405 --> 00:03:05,685
Instead of saying, let's send a guy with
the LA ladder, we set, let's push to

48
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,644
pro, we reduced deployment time by 85%.

49
00:03:09,644 --> 00:03:13,634
You know what I'm trying to say is that,
so instead of sending a person with a

50
00:03:13,634 --> 00:03:15,674
USD stick with, along with a ladder.

51
00:03:16,214 --> 00:03:19,484
So what we just did was
let's push it to the prod.

52
00:03:19,544 --> 00:03:24,104
Whatever the automation we did, we
reduced the deployment time by 85% and

53
00:03:24,164 --> 00:03:29,664
created a rollback options that didn't
exist in the real traditional networking.

54
00:03:30,204 --> 00:03:35,154
So here comes our next slide, which is
like a building the low latency network.

55
00:03:35,484 --> 00:03:37,914
So it's about a latency breakdown.

56
00:03:37,914 --> 00:03:41,045
I'm talking here to
make smart cities smart.

57
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,165
They need to respond instantly.

58
00:03:43,464 --> 00:03:46,734
We need a sub 10 milliseconds latency.

59
00:03:46,825 --> 00:03:52,084
That meant small cells on the light
poles building business buses, basically

60
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:56,614
anywhere with power and wifi and fiber
back haul, connecting everything,

61
00:03:56,884 --> 00:03:58,984
edge nodes, doing local processing.

62
00:03:58,984 --> 00:04:02,674
No more round trips to
a cloud 2000 miles away.

63
00:04:03,094 --> 00:04:07,834
This enabled right live video
analytics, real time alerts.

64
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:10,399
And autonomous drone patterns.

65
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:13,010
We are talking Miss milliseconds here.

66
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:14,989
That's less than a blink.

67
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:20,659
Imagine a camera, spots a fire
and instantly rewrote the traffic

68
00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:21,979
with a dispatching alerts.

69
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:27,909
No waiting, no bottlenecks instantly
rero the ambulances to a different

70
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,190
route so that you can save lives.

71
00:04:30,614 --> 00:04:33,414
So it's like interesting
thing we built here.

72
00:04:33,715 --> 00:04:40,525
So next go, I'll go to the section four,
which is a IOT mess like iot ecosystem.

73
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:46,734
What I taught, what we presented, so
it's like we have connected like network.

74
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:49,374
We layered in devices, lots of them.

75
00:04:49,734 --> 00:04:52,944
So like 10,000 connected
endpoints per square mile.

76
00:04:53,754 --> 00:05:00,025
Smart meters, pollution sensors, cameras,
emergency buttons, EV chargers, so all

77
00:05:00,265 --> 00:05:03,085
talking, adapting, learning autonomously.

78
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:09,414
We didn't just install gadgets, but we
created a nervous system for the city.

79
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:15,354
One time our sensors picked up
an air quality spike and rerouted

80
00:05:15,354 --> 00:05:17,004
a school buses away from it.

81
00:05:17,244 --> 00:05:19,314
So that isn't a mesmerizing.

82
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:21,564
So no humans involved in there.

83
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:27,905
Like just the systems have been taken
care and they, the system just knew it.

84
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:33,034
So it has picked an air quality
in the air and spike and rerouted

85
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:35,734
the traffic along the distances.

86
00:05:36,094 --> 00:05:39,164
So here comes our next slide.

87
00:05:39,224 --> 00:05:44,554
It's a smart traffic management which
we call it as a smart traffic and power.

88
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,849
So I will talk a little bit
about the smart traffic here.

89
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:55,299
With AI powered video analysis, our system
adjusted traffic lights in a real time.

90
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:59,019
So I told you right, so it, the
traffic got rerouted in the previous

91
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:03,279
lights, so it's like a lights
adapted to the condition, not timers.

92
00:06:03,904 --> 00:06:07,384
Like what we talk about
previous lives, green waves

93
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:09,964
reduced stop and start driving.

94
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:15,304
Emergency corridors were dynamically
open for the ambulances and fire trucks.

95
00:06:15,664 --> 00:06:21,124
We reduced the commute times by
25% and cut idle time in half.

96
00:06:21,694 --> 00:06:26,024
That's gas saved time saved
and air cleaned up, right?

97
00:06:26,024 --> 00:06:27,704
So now on to the power.

98
00:06:28,124 --> 00:06:33,404
We used a smart grids IOT meters
that automatically balanced energy,

99
00:06:33,824 --> 00:06:36,584
a solar output high charged.

100
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:41,384
The EV stations demand low at night
power street lights using stored

101
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:47,894
batteries, neighborhood surge shift
load instantly, and this led to a

102
00:06:48,164 --> 00:06:54,224
35% reduction in the city using it
and 28% drop in the carbon output.

103
00:06:54,254 --> 00:06:57,194
And it was just efficient
and it was sustainable.

104
00:06:57,794 --> 00:07:02,614
So that's where my smart traffic
and power management came in.

105
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:07,114
And let's do the next slide,
which is how we rolled it out

106
00:07:07,114 --> 00:07:10,034
into the real time traffic here.

107
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:13,414
The, this wasn't just a one day
magic or something like that.

108
00:07:13,654 --> 00:07:18,405
It was structured and in a
phases like, assessment phase

109
00:07:18,824 --> 00:07:21,504
and automation work pilot zone.

110
00:07:21,864 --> 00:07:23,844
Parallel rollout and all.

111
00:07:23,994 --> 00:07:28,854
So assessment phase is every duck
pole and antione was mapped in the

112
00:07:28,854 --> 00:07:30,924
assessment phase in the initial phase.

113
00:07:31,104 --> 00:07:33,474
Then afterwards it's an
automation framework.

114
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:38,504
There, there comes our picture like,
building A-C-I-C-D pipelines with the

115
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:42,914
A bill for infrastructure and all this
comes into the automation framework.

116
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:46,729
And next phase we went to the pilot zone.

117
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:51,949
We started in dense downtown
zones, like where we have a a heavy

118
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:54,169
traffic and also to test it out.

119
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:57,084
So we did that in a,
as a pilot zone phase.

120
00:07:57,264 --> 00:08:03,324
And after that parallel roll rollout
using IAC and kops, we scaled citywide.

121
00:08:03,654 --> 00:08:05,504
So we treated infrastructure.

122
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:11,169
Like software, like a clean,
modular, testable, each

123
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:12,999
deployment validated itself.

124
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:16,664
And yeah, as I mentioned, this
all conducted in a phases, so that

125
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:19,064
helped a lot for us to move forward.

126
00:08:19,454 --> 00:08:24,374
So here comes the, a real impact,
like a measurable impact, what we

127
00:08:24,374 --> 00:08:26,174
have achieved using this one, right?

128
00:08:26,174 --> 00:08:27,704
I'll tell you the numbers, right?

129
00:08:28,604 --> 00:08:33,474
So it's all about 23%
lower commute times 42%.

130
00:08:34,434 --> 00:08:40,424
Of a faster emergency response and 35%
of our energy savings have been showed up

131
00:08:40,664 --> 00:08:44,714
and 64% bump in a resident satisfaction.

132
00:08:44,714 --> 00:08:47,795
These are like an app approximate values.

133
00:08:47,795 --> 00:08:51,034
What we collected so far from
the c, from the automation.

134
00:08:51,274 --> 00:08:54,634
This wasn't just a dashboards
and data I was talking here, it

135
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,644
was a people living better lives.

136
00:08:56,724 --> 00:09:00,774
Like when it comes to the commuter,
whatever the automation we did using the

137
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:06,384
5G one CT manager said, we used to respond
to the problems, now we prevent them.

138
00:09:06,804 --> 00:09:08,574
That there isn't that amazing.

139
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:09,174
Yep.

140
00:09:09,234 --> 00:09:09,534
Yep.

141
00:09:09,714 --> 00:09:12,534
So that's what we achieved
with the automation.

142
00:09:12,734 --> 00:09:15,915
And next to the scaling
to the global cities.

143
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:20,685
What we talk here about is a
scalable architecture and open

144
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,454
standards and knowledge transfer.

145
00:09:22,634 --> 00:09:29,185
So we didn't want to be a onetime
success year, so we opened or we,

146
00:09:29,244 --> 00:09:33,305
so we open source the blueprint
model which is a modular playbooks.

147
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,910
Vendor, neutral tech and a
training program for cities.

148
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:44,119
So now as I spoke, we are working with
the 15 plus cities globally, scaling

149
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:48,199
up with the AI driven automation
and adding privacy fast designs.

150
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:55,099
So Citizen Trust is built in, this is the
future and that, and it's, and repeatable,

151
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:57,290
so scalable architecture, what.

152
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:01,755
We, when we talk about is that our
frameworks seamlessly adapts to

153
00:10:01,964 --> 00:10:07,604
metropolitan areas of any scale
implementation can be faced.

154
00:10:08,354 --> 00:10:08,655
Yeah.

155
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:14,335
So this is, as I told, this is the future
and it's unrepeatable when it comes to the

156
00:10:14,415 --> 00:10:20,775
the path forward of what it is, expanding
the partnerships and, enhance the privacy

157
00:10:20,775 --> 00:10:23,595
framework and advanced AI integration.

158
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:28,005
So this all comes under the
forward thinking, like a path

159
00:10:28,005 --> 00:10:32,835
forward, what I'm talking and
he, it's just, it is a wrap up.

160
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,620
To wrap up everything.

161
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,640
So 5G isn't just a speed, it's
about a smart infrastructure,

162
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,750
and DevOps isn't just for a code,
it's also for automating cities.

163
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:47,820
Just as an example, as I mentioned, we
are not just solving traffic pro jams.

164
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:52,980
We are building a future where
cities think, adopt, and care for

165
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,960
