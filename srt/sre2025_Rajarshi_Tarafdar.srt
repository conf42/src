1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,630
Hi all.

2
00:00:01,689 --> 00:00:04,970
This is thank you for joining my talk.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:11,489
Today I am discuss human AI sym
robotics, which is revolutionizing

4
00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:15,219
the precision in collaborative
systems with datadriven advancements.

5
00:00:16,134 --> 00:00:21,384
The human ai Symbi Robotics is
transforming the collaborative systems

6
00:00:21,384 --> 00:00:26,905
through continuous feedback loops that
enhances both the human creativity and

7
00:00:26,905 --> 00:00:29,545
the artificial intelligence capabilities.

8
00:00:30,384 --> 00:00:34,574
Today, I'm going to present that
explores how these revolutionized.

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,240
Systems which is has high impact on
high position fields such as surgery.

10
00:00:41,839 --> 00:00:46,190
And it also helps in integrating
the multimodal perception.

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,440
It helps in our medical predictions.

12
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,955
It helps in the bidirectional
interfaces and physical actuation.

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,880
In this topic, we'll examine the
measurable improvements in these

14
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,410
surgical outcomes, challenges in
the implementations, and the future

15
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,910
potential of these technologies
which spans across various domains.

16
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,210
Coming to the next slide,

17
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,380
today we are going to discuss
about the architecture of the

18
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,600
human AI symbiotic systems.

19
00:01:18,365 --> 00:01:24,264
It's on the kind of pial structure
where we have shown the, a diagram there

20
00:01:24,264 --> 00:01:28,764
is multimodal perception which is the
advanced sensor fusion technologies.

21
00:01:29,634 --> 00:01:32,744
And then there comes the
AI prediction engines.

22
00:01:32,984 --> 00:01:34,364
Machine learning algorithms.

23
00:01:35,234 --> 00:01:39,604
There is physical actuators, which
has the precision mechanical response

24
00:01:39,604 --> 00:01:45,184
systems, and there comes the bidirectional
interfaces, which consist of the

25
00:01:45,184 --> 00:01:47,584
seamless human AI communication channels.

26
00:01:48,394 --> 00:01:52,234
The foundation of these symbiotic
robotics reached on these

27
00:01:52,234 --> 00:01:54,094
four integrated subsystems.

28
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:59,979
Advanced sensor fusion helps in
collecting the environmental data

29
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:04,299
while the machine learning gets the
feedback from the real time data.

30
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:10,719
It helps in making the computational
decisions into physical actions and

31
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,589
also increases the accuracy up to 94.2.

32
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:19,819
We have given a use case
for applications here.

33
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:25,569
We have used the different parameters in
terms of the metrics the decision latency

34
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:30,769
reduction it helps in the faster surgical
making decisions, thereby increasing

35
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:34,819
the productivity up to almost 58.4%.

36
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:39,679
Then there comes the position improvement
where we are dealing with the enhanced

37
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:46,974
tissue MA manipulation accuracy, and
that comes around almost 29 7% accuracy.

38
00:02:47,814 --> 00:02:52,574
And then there is also the
complication reduction and we are

39
00:02:52,574 --> 00:02:56,534
seeing a significant reduce in
the minor surgical complications.

40
00:02:57,164 --> 00:03:00,064
And that will be around 41.2%.

41
00:03:00,844 --> 00:03:05,084
And also there is average reduction
in the patient stay duration.

42
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:08,664
So almost eight.

43
00:03:10,894 --> 00:03:16,534
So these surgical platforms based on
the AI has demonstrated significant

44
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:18,724
improvements in the clinical outcomes.

45
00:03:19,474 --> 00:03:24,414
The it also enhances the surgical
capabilities by providing the real time

46
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:27,779
guidance and precision instrument control.

47
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:33,169
Therefore it helps in the just
technological and for the better

48
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:35,779
experience from the patient perspective.

49
00:03:36,779 --> 00:03:41,359
We have given some diagram, which
consist of different parameters

50
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:43,519
unnecessary movements total.

51
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,039
Cognitive load and task performance.

52
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,474
We have just try to give this metrics.

53
00:03:49,344 --> 00:03:55,174
So these symbiotic systems practically
improve workflow efficiency

54
00:03:55,174 --> 00:03:57,094
across multiple dimensions.

55
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:03,254
Almost 25% reduction in unnecessary
instrument movements coupled with

56
00:04:03,314 --> 00:04:10,155
around almost 19.3% decrease in the
total demonstrates how AI optimization

57
00:04:10,155 --> 00:04:12,725
streamlines technical execution.

58
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:18,889
These systems reduces the
cognitive load by almost 28.4%.

59
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:26,499
This gives these a lot of help in terms of
the critical decision making rather than

60
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,889
mechanical execution of the routine task.

61
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:33,739
This use case helps in achieving
the superhuman position.

62
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:38,929
But there are also human limitations
these surgeons are facing.

63
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,404
Like a lot of issues in the
terms of the micro surgeries.

64
00:04:42,744 --> 00:04:46,479
There can be a natural hand
framer or there is like

65
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,789
induced position degradation.

66
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:55,129
Visual perception limitations, and
when this system integrate with the

67
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,299
ai the, basically the AI robotic
capabilities enhances this limitations.

68
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:03,889
There are barriers, tre
filtering and the motion scaling.

69
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:08,219
There is enhanced visual
feedback with the magnification.

70
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:14,109
Then submillimeter positions
consistently are maintained in the most

71
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:16,779
demanding microsurgical applications.

72
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:20,949
AI assisted robotic systems have
demonstrated capabilities that

73
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:23,109
exceed expert human performance.

74
00:05:23,994 --> 00:05:28,954
These position enables the surgical
possibilities which are previously

75
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,974
considered too risky and for the patients.

76
00:05:32,744 --> 00:05:37,759
These AI robotic capabilities help since
it's numerous on in this surgery field.

77
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,529
There are also lot of
technical challenges.

78
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:46,444
We have to deal with latency management
intent prediction and safety.

79
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:55,639
Though it has really advanced the systems
uht around 5,200 milliseconds in terms of

80
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:01,654
the critical performance in the critical
applications we, in order to reduce these,

81
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:06,324
we have, we need further innovations
in terms of the communication protocol

82
00:06:06,774 --> 00:06:09,204
and the com computational architecture.

83
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:16,710
So in case of the intent prediction, our
current algorithms achieve almost 94.2%

84
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:22,660
accuracy in predictable scenarios, but
struggle with noble situations and expert

85
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:29,225
level technique that devi from different
training patterns and safety verification

86
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,710
perspective, formal verification of the.

87
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,720
Systems remains challenging
here, so we have to add up the

88
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,750
AI human collaborative systems.

89
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,230
Bidirectional learning.

90
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,540
I have some here.

91
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:53,735
There are different forms like human
expertise which provides intuition

92
00:06:53,785 --> 00:06:56,095
creativity and the judgment capabilities.

93
00:06:56,615 --> 00:06:58,615
Then it'll be the human learning.

94
00:06:59,095 --> 00:07:04,994
Hydrogen again, various insights from the
previous decision making AI capabilities.

95
00:07:05,655 --> 00:07:08,655
Then the AI enhancements
also comes into picture.

96
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:13,634
So the system improves precision
and the Integr collective expertise.

97
00:07:14,144 --> 00:07:18,195
Then the knowledge transfer, so
the techniques are already captured

98
00:07:18,195 --> 00:07:20,145
and encoded into the AI models.

99
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:26,880
So these systems continuously help in the
bidirectional learning where the humans

100
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,490
and the AI both are mutually improving.

101
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,420
And surgeon also teach the
system their techniques.

102
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:39,025
While also gathering the necessary
feedback in terms of the AI capabilities.

103
00:07:39,535 --> 00:07:43,155
So this is basically a
bidirectional learning capabilities.

104
00:07:43,345 --> 00:07:47,095
Both the AI and the
are collaborating with.

105
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:51,945
So there are various multimodal
communication interfaces there.

106
00:07:52,345 --> 00:07:55,875
One is voice control which
consists of the natural language

107
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,915
commands and confirmations.

108
00:07:58,365 --> 00:07:59,925
Then there is gauge tracking.

109
00:08:00,055 --> 00:08:03,425
So the eye movement monitoring
for attention based control.

110
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,920
Helps in the gauge tracking and then
there is the gesture recognition.

111
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,100
Hand and the body movement
interpretation falls under this

112
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,250
and the he haptic feedback.

113
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,005
This will be basically the force
and the tactile sensation delivery.

114
00:08:20,145 --> 00:08:25,285
So these channels has drastically
reduced in terms of the in cognitive

115
00:08:25,335 --> 00:08:29,425
workload almost reduction around 32.6%.

116
00:08:30,145 --> 00:08:34,715
And around improvement of
28% in the tax performance.

117
00:08:35,255 --> 00:08:37,815
These interfaces create more in, I.

118
00:08:38,815 --> 00:08:44,145
By leveraging the natural communication
modes and the providing ens feedback.

119
00:08:44,805 --> 00:08:49,095
The most effective systems here
adapt to the different users

120
00:08:49,185 --> 00:08:51,280
and preferences and needs.

121
00:08:52,085 --> 00:08:56,395
This helps in switching, the multimodal
communication interface, which is.

122
00:08:57,395 --> 00:09:00,785
Then there comes the ethical
framework for the integration

123
00:09:00,835 --> 00:09:03,055
here, the autonomy and the control.

124
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:06,595
Establishing clear boundaries
for ai, decision making

125
00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:10,575
authority while maintaining
the meaningful human oversight.

126
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:13,115
And then there is data privacy.

127
00:09:14,825 --> 00:09:19,075
In these developing protocols for
responsible collection and use of

128
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:25,615
surgical data while ensuring appropriate
patient consent and the revolution

129
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:30,445
responsibility attribution it'll
help in creating the frameworks for.

130
00:09:31,015 --> 00:09:35,315
Determining the accountability
when the outcomes involve the human

131
00:09:35,315 --> 00:09:39,835
AI collaborative decisions the
access and the equity addressing

132
00:09:39,835 --> 00:09:44,405
disparities in availability of
advanced surgical technologies across

133
00:09:44,435 --> 00:09:49,440
healthcare systems and geographical
regions to prevent the quality gaps.

134
00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:55,014
But we have to consider this in terms
of the ethical guidance to see whether

135
00:09:55,014 --> 00:09:59,904
this integration will be ethically
integrate into this AL practice.

136
00:10:00,214 --> 00:10:04,174
It'll create the trust among the
patients and the practitioners

137
00:10:04,174 --> 00:10:05,554
and the regularity bodies.

138
00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:12,569
We can also use in different
applications apart from surgery.

139
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:17,149
We can use this in the different
domains like industrial manufacturing

140
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,319
which always need the precision.

141
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:23,519
And it's a complex environment, so
it's basically needs the flexibility.

142
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:29,879
We also can explain this use case in
the, space exploration which art space,

143
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:35,579
latency compensation with the remote
operations and the disaster response.

144
00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:40,559
So in case of any difficult environment
intervention with the human judgment

145
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:45,559
and then there comes this scientific
research so micro nanoscale

146
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:48,089
manipulation with the, human creativity.

147
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:52,089
So these principles and the
technologies developed for the

148
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:56,439
surgical applications are finding
new homes across diverse domains,

149
00:10:56,979 --> 00:11:01,429
each feel presence, unique challenges
for these human AI collaborations.

150
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:04,569
But all can be made mutually beneficial.

151
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:09,369
And these applications can be
span across multiple domains.

152
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:12,629
It's a multi-billion
dollar industries, but.

153
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:17,979
In major kit takeaway from
this top the symbiotic future.

154
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,844
So it's miserable impact human AI
symbiotic systems have demonstrated ative,

155
00:11:24,214 --> 00:11:30,104
improvements in this iCal outcomes almost
the precision increased to almost 30% and

156
00:11:30,104 --> 00:11:33,014
the complication reductions to almost 32%.

157
00:11:33,674 --> 00:11:35,774
And it's actually continuous evolving.

158
00:11:35,774 --> 00:11:39,794
We are just doing the ongoing research
in the bidirectional learning and

159
00:11:39,794 --> 00:11:44,904
the multimodal interface in terms of
the latency and intent prediction.

160
00:11:45,444 --> 00:11:48,264
And there is also complement capabilities.

161
00:11:48,364 --> 00:11:53,264
So the most successful implementations
leverage the strengths of the human

162
00:11:53,314 --> 00:11:55,774
intuition and the machine precisions.

163
00:11:56,584 --> 00:11:59,544
And we can be on the surgical settings.

164
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:05,474
We can expand this to the different
domains like space industry disaster

165
00:12:05,504 --> 00:12:11,344
management had the human judgment and the
mission positions must seamlessly combine.

166
00:12:12,094 --> 00:12:18,334
Here our goal is not to replace human with
ai, but just key takeaway is to combine

167
00:12:18,334 --> 00:12:22,024
the human in the AI symbiotic robotics.

168
00:12:22,744 --> 00:12:25,564
And it is needs to be a
collaborative environment.

169
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:31,434
So where the, humans or nations could
accomplish anything independently.

170
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:32,824
Thank you all.
