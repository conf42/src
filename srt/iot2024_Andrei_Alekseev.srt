1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:00,970
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,070
My name is Andrew.

3
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,440
Today I will tell you about artificial
intelligence and how it's changing

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,730
the fintech industry and make it even
more interesting than it was before.

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,190
Let's begin.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,929
before we get started, please
allow me to introduce myself.

7
00:00:16,389 --> 00:00:18,319
I'm a professional marketing specialist.

8
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:22,474
I studied marketing at university and have
been working in the marketing company.

9
00:00:23,035 --> 00:00:27,495
For 20 years, 14 of which I have
been working in the fintech industry.

10
00:00:27,865 --> 00:00:31,104
And right now I am the chief
marketing officer at well trade.

11
00:00:31,184 --> 00:00:32,834
trade is a financial company.

12
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:33,624
Okay.

13
00:00:33,624 --> 00:00:38,114
So today I will tell you about several
interesting cases that my colleagues in

14
00:00:38,114 --> 00:00:43,144
the industry are doing, and which I have
directly encountered at work with every

15
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:45,874
day, I will tell you a little bit about.

16
00:00:45,925 --> 00:00:50,440
chatbots, bot agents and how
artificial intelligence is changing the

17
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,550
infrastructure of the brokers themselves.

18
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,060
we will also talk about content
and how content creation is

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,650
currently becoming one of the main
jobs for artificial intelligence.

20
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,850
I will tell you about how
AI helps in advertising.

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,780
And in acquiring and retaining customers,
I will give you two good examples from my

22
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,910
previous companies, Libertex and Volbi.

23
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,720
And we will finish this presentation
with a short discussion on the topic

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,710
of the future of AI and FinTech.

25
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:20,570
Okay.

26
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,560
So let's start with
chatbots and bot agents.

27
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,400
This is the most obvious case of using
artificial intelligence, in my opinion.

28
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,890
And at the moment I have several
examples when AI completely changed

29
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,600
the entire customer support department.

30
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,280
Many of you already know what intercom is.

31
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:44,080
Intercom is highly convenient platform for
customer support, where you can connect

32
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,370
all incoming requests from online chats.

33
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,840
Emails, different social
media networks in one place.

34
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,000
they already have a built in AI feature.

35
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,740
And when I worked at crypto startup,
you holder, we were one of the first

36
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,990
company who actually tried their feature.

37
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,770
And we did this with two
different approaches.

38
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,540
The first one, we built bot
that solved the most popular

39
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,960
problems right in the online chat.

40
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,160
It didn't just answer questions,
but actually solved problems.

41
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,870
For example, we, with the searching
of, for a transaction in the blockchain

42
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:29,810
or with the verification status at
the KYC stage, and this bot instantly

43
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,700
reduced the flow of incoming requests
in the department and actually.

44
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,520
Decrease the workload for the whole team.

45
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,960
And secondly, we connected the AI agent to
all dialects with life support specialists

46
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,350
so that the AI agent could learn.

47
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,270
And then just a couple of weeks,
the bot completely learned

48
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,330
how and what to answer people.

49
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,280
Then we launched it on its own,
but only on night shifts when we

50
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,000
had a shortage of life agents.

51
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,520
And that bot did really well.

52
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:08,850
The advantages of AI in the support
department are obvious, AI reacts faster,

53
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,560
AI is more accurate, and it's not subject
to emotions because sometimes life agent

54
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:20,040
can be not in a good mood and person just
can reply something not that politely, or

55
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:26,660
it's not that accurate and most important
AI can work 24 seven without salary.

56
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,290
What did all this cases lead to?

57
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:29,970
You can ask.

58
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:35,110
And I think many have already guessed,
when we just first started this project,

59
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,790
we had 14 different people working
in the customer support department.

60
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:43,490
Now there are only three left
and they are doing pretty good.

61
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,020
And the last case.

62
00:03:45,545 --> 00:03:46,655
It's about feedback.

63
00:03:46,705 --> 00:03:51,775
when I worked at a Markets, we
created an amazing AI bot on Telegram

64
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:55,405
for collecting all feedbacks on the
internet about the company for the last

65
00:03:55,405 --> 00:03:58,435
24 hours with automatic translation.

66
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:03,415
For example, every morning at
9:00 AM I had a notification from

67
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:05,155
that bot with all the feedback.

68
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,090
That we had on Trustpilot,
AppStore, Google Play yesterday.

69
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,700
That allowed me to constantly monitor
the situation with our customer

70
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,070
service and our scores everywhere.

71
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:18,930
Okay.

72
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,300
let's move on.

73
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,550
This is the more complex case
of AI application in fintech.

74
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,460
I would call it infrastructure.

75
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,700
I know of several good examples
of AI using compliance and dealing

76
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:36,380
firstly, this is the very obvious case
with money laundering and screening

77
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,140
of clients and their transactions.

78
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,460
there are several companies that
provide such service for several

79
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,890
thousands dollars a month.

80
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,240
But the good news is you can do it.

81
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,040
Yourself completely.

82
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,610
Today, there are solutions where AI
helps fintech companies check clients

83
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:59,180
for sanctions lists and analyze incoming
transactions, checking the crypto wallets

84
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,670
and addresses just to make sure that
wallet is a red flag, not green flag.

85
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:10,490
And secondly, I know several examples
of successful integration of AI into

86
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:15,660
the dealing infrastructure, even in my
current company, AI successfully tracks

87
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:21,750
suspicious trading activity, asset price
manipulation, or group bonuses laundering.

88
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:26,520
The system automatically analyze
when something suspicious happens.

89
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:31,170
For example, very similar trades from
the same location with the same IP

90
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,220
address, but with different devices.

91
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,750
And finally, AI successfully assists
dealing in daily work, for example,

92
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:45,260
managing liquidity and order book,
and also helping with price slippage.

93
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,410
Okay.

94
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,070
enough about boring stuff.

95
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,990
Let's talk about customer
acquisition and advertisement.

96
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:57,160
as many companies have already switched
completely to AI generated content.

97
00:05:57,705 --> 00:06:01,475
as an example of big players,
I can refer to eToro.

98
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:06,625
I was recently in London at the finance
conference, finance magnets conference,

99
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:11,675
and I talked to Stephanie, she's the
marketing director at eToro and she

100
00:06:11,675 --> 00:06:16,215
said that almost all the texts on the
web, on their website, all the pictures

101
00:06:16,235 --> 00:06:18,925
and translations were made using AI.

102
00:06:19,425 --> 00:06:22,935
In addition, she said that their latest.

103
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,420
big advertising campaign, which they
launched for the Olympic games this year

104
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,670
was 95 percent made with the help of AI.

105
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,060
You can Google this campaign
and watch videos on YouTube.

106
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,780
It's really cool.

107
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,480
It, it's really amazing.

108
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,910
Another example of successful use
of AI and work is a root stock lab.

109
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,760
you can check their website.

110
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,350
That's the crypto startup from Europe.

111
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:55,040
And all their content on the website,
including pictures, images, translation

112
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,830
is made with the help of AI.

113
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,730
their latest educational and
advertising campaign, which they

114
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:07,840
launch in honor of Bitcoin birthday
was made entirely with the help of AI.

115
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:08,980
What can I say?

116
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,610
It's just, wow.

117
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,540
Okay.

118
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:16,560
from attracting clients, we move on
to activating them and retaining them.

119
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,670
As an example of using AI, I
can tell you about my case with

120
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,410
Libertex, where I can work, where
I worked for six and a half years.

121
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:29,360
And for those who don't know,
Libertex is a trading platform.

122
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:36,470
And like many other offers, large brokers,
they had the resources to support an

123
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,710
entire department called the Academy.

124
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,320
So the trading Academy was engaged
in preparing trading ideas, trading

125
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:51,440
strategies, writing digests, making
forecasts for various assets and every

126
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,570
quarter releasing large analytical
reports on various markets with

127
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,280
forecasts and price prediction.

128
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:04,830
So as soon as AI appeared, we decided
to try to use it in daily tasks.

129
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:10,960
Yes, of course, we had to train the model
first for a really long time, but what

130
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,020
they have now is just simply amazing.

131
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,230
According to statistics, AI
even often gives more accurate

132
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,710
forecasts than a human.

133
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,900
the academy is no longer exists.

134
00:08:23,835 --> 00:08:28,845
now it called Libertex lab and it has
everything for new clients, as well as

135
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:33,265
experienced traders, as you may know,
one of the biggest pain points for a

136
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:39,425
newbie in financial markets is opening
the first deal people are just afraid.

137
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,520
To make a mistake.

138
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,610
They are not experienced enough yet.

139
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:49,800
Yes, they may understand what they
are interested in, for example,

140
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,480
gold or Bitcoin, but they are not
even sure which direction to open

141
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,870
the deal up or down, long or short.

142
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:04,150
So now this problem completely
covered by trading signals.

143
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,110
If you don't know what
to trade, no problem.

144
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,710
Here is the whole set of trading
signals where you can open several

145
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:16,050
deals on different assets at once with
just one click and earn money fast

146
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,390
for more attract advanced traders.

147
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,910
AI prepares trading ideas, trading
strategies, reviews, and weekly

148
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:29,210
digests with price forecasts
for different assets in general.

149
00:09:29,955 --> 00:09:35,125
As far as I remember, out of 12 people
who used to work at the academy, only

150
00:09:35,205 --> 00:09:40,605
two people remain who work with prompts
and constantly generate content.

151
00:09:41,305 --> 00:09:42,245
So that's about it.

152
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:44,505
AI taking our jobs.

153
00:09:45,005 --> 00:09:45,325
Okay.

154
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:48,535
So moving next to my favorite example yet.

155
00:09:48,535 --> 00:09:53,968
We'll be, we'll be is the next
generation trading platform,

156
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,141
completely focused on AI.

157
00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:57,781
The idea is pretty simple.

158
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,966
AI will help you to trade better.

159
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:04,866
And the biggest flaw of a
successful trader is emotions.

160
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:09,196
Sometimes emotions make a successful
trader, not very successful, and the

161
00:10:09,196 --> 00:10:11,246
person can just lose all the money.

162
00:10:11,746 --> 00:10:14,896
This is the problem that will be solves.

163
00:10:15,386 --> 00:10:18,316
They initially made their
platform based on the AI.

164
00:10:18,436 --> 00:10:22,586
at the very initial stage, a trader
can choose an assistant like a

165
00:10:22,586 --> 00:10:24,656
co pilot who is ready to adapt.

166
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:30,356
to the trading style and needs
of any person in will be those

167
00:10:30,356 --> 00:10:32,296
assistants, are called bodies.

168
00:10:32,746 --> 00:10:36,716
At the moment, you can choose one
of five different bodies depending

169
00:10:36,806 --> 00:10:42,526
on the assets you are interested
in, the level of risk tolerance that

170
00:10:42,586 --> 00:10:44,526
you have and your trading strategy.

171
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:49,456
In essence, five different bodies
are different prompts that work

172
00:10:49,456 --> 00:10:51,976
with, within the specific framework.

173
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:53,651
what's, highly versatile.

174
00:10:53,661 --> 00:10:58,191
They can, they capable of
fundamental and technical analysis.

175
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:03,241
Roughly speaking, they constantly monitor
what is happening in the news or social

176
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:09,361
media and give forecasts on how this may
affect the price of a particular coin.

177
00:11:09,641 --> 00:11:14,151
For example, if Elon Musk writes
something positive about Dogecoin

178
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:18,321
on Twitter, the body will give you
a buy signal almost immediately.

179
00:11:18,821 --> 00:11:22,831
In addition, the body
constantly analyzes the charts.

180
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:27,601
If any pattern is noticed on the
candles, you will also receive a push

181
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:29,922
notifications with the trading signal.

182
00:11:30,242 --> 00:11:33,902
When you click on this notification,
you will immediately be offered

183
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:38,172
a deal, which you can accept
and open in literally one click.

184
00:11:38,672 --> 00:11:40,352
I think this is a very cool.

185
00:11:40,352 --> 00:11:43,852
And as far as I know, this project is
growing and developing really fast.

186
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:48,712
And at the moment they already have tens
of thousands of active traders per day.

187
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,552
I wish them a very good luck.

188
00:11:52,052 --> 00:11:52,412
Okay.

189
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:55,772
almost at the end of the presentation,
let me tell you a little bit about

190
00:11:55,872 --> 00:12:02,292
how AI helps, very large corporations
Bloomberg and the Reuters have already

191
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,022
widely implemented AI in their processes.

192
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:09,337
For example, I know about a unique
technology that helps them to research

193
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:11,957
and analyze large amounts of data.

194
00:12:12,787 --> 00:12:19,767
The AI based system scans all the
world's weather forecasts, websites, the

195
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:25,327
system monitor natural disasters, like
droughts, floods, and other events that

196
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:32,407
can somehow affect the harvest of various
assets, such as coffee, cocoa, or wheat.

197
00:12:32,907 --> 00:12:37,657
If the AI sees something that can
affect the harvest, for example, it

198
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:40,017
can affect the price of the asset.

199
00:12:40,237 --> 00:12:44,287
AI automatically writes an
analytical forecast based on the

200
00:12:44,287 --> 00:12:48,787
data and sends this report to a
person who can make a decision.

201
00:12:49,747 --> 00:12:52,877
I think this is an amazing
example, how AI can help traders.

202
00:12:53,377 --> 00:12:56,587
So you can take your time
to find all articles.

203
00:12:57,427 --> 00:13:01,877
on Reuters and Bloomberg, where they
predict a rise in coffee prices.

204
00:13:02,377 --> 00:13:06,577
And as you may know, right now, coffee
prices have reached record levels.

205
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:07,427
okay.

206
00:13:07,427 --> 00:13:10,097
My final slide, let's
talk about the future.

207
00:13:10,597 --> 00:13:14,457
What do you think awaits
FinTech in the near future?

208
00:13:15,317 --> 00:13:18,627
I think there are several
possible scenarios.

209
00:13:18,627 --> 00:13:19,391
Scenarios.

210
00:13:19,722 --> 00:13:25,622
We may be able to fully customize
the interface like Tom Cruise in the

211
00:13:26,312 --> 00:13:28,462
Minority Rapport movie, for example.

212
00:13:29,112 --> 00:13:33,942
AI can completely change our understanding
of Interaction with the interface.

213
00:13:34,282 --> 00:13:37,582
Maybe we won't even need to
monitor the price chart anymore.

214
00:13:37,742 --> 00:13:38,072
Who knows?

215
00:13:38,072 --> 00:13:42,772
I'm A hundred, almost a hundred percent.

216
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:43,152
Sure.

217
00:13:43,152 --> 00:13:47,072
That's soon more and more
platform will add trading bots.

218
00:13:47,902 --> 00:13:52,922
Each trader will be able to choose any
bot depending on the trading strategy,

219
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:55,622
risk tolerance, or deposit amount.

220
00:13:56,462 --> 00:14:01,162
And perhaps soon we will see how
brokers will add the ability to

221
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:03,042
customize the trading platform itself.

222
00:14:03,412 --> 00:14:06,632
For example, someone
may find the buy, long.

223
00:14:07,202 --> 00:14:10,122
By button on the right
side, more convenient than

224
00:14:10,122 --> 00:14:11,772
on the left and vice versa.

225
00:14:11,882 --> 00:14:12,372
Who knows?

226
00:14:12,972 --> 00:14:17,462
Someone needs a minute charts while
someone else doesn't need charts at all.

227
00:14:17,462 --> 00:14:24,392
AI can generate and customize any
interface for the needs of every

228
00:14:24,392 --> 00:14:28,542
trader, as it will be convenient
for him or for her in general.

229
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:32,662
I think that AI and fintech is
just gaining momentum and the

230
00:14:32,732 --> 00:14:34,372
most interesting is yet to come.

231
00:14:34,872 --> 00:14:35,212
Okay.

232
00:14:35,212 --> 00:14:38,312
So that's all I have for now.

233
00:14:38,782 --> 00:14:40,212
Thank you for your attention.

234
00:14:40,352 --> 00:14:41,802
I hope you enjoy it.

235
00:14:42,302 --> 00:14:42,762
Please.

236
00:14:42,972 --> 00:14:46,531
You can scan if you want to connect
with me, just scan the QR code

237
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:48,172
and let's be in touch on LinkedIn.

238
00:14:49,002 --> 00:14:50,802
And for now, bye everyone.

239
00:14:50,982 --> 00:14:51,522
Thanks again.
