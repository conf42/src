00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,770
Hello everyone and welcome.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:07,370
I'm Somnath Trewale and today we are going
to deep dive into Azure Site Recovery.

3
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:14,215
A modern cloud native approach to a
disaster recovery that's transforming

4
00:00:14,424 --> 00:00:17,965
the way business ensures resiliency.

5
00:00:18,634 --> 00:00:25,494
Disaster recovery has came a long way,
and I think it's important to first take

6
00:00:25,495 --> 00:00:28,924
a step back and look at how we got there.

7
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:35,530
In the early 2000, a disaster
recovery was a. Completely a manual

8
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,390
process, backup tapes, secondary data
centers, and long recovery times.

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:47,270
It may take around 24 hours or more
just to bring a system back online.

10
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:53,549
Then we saw a virtualization
change the game Hyper V VMware.

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,730
These technologies helped
to reduce recovery times to

12
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,680
hours and made testing easier.

13
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:06,939
Now, we entered the new era,
cloud based disaster recovery.

14
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:13,080
With Azure Site Recovery brings
instant failover, a few minutes

15
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,480
RTOs, and intelligent orchestration.

16
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:23,210
The flexibility and scalability of
the cloud mean business can Achieve

17
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:28,080
a resilience without a complexity
of a traditional infrastructure.

18
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,310
Now let's talk about the
architecture of Azure Site Recovery.

19
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:39,130
If you are running Azure VMs,
our application is seamless.

20
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:42,109
No additional infrastructure is needed.

21
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,750
The Azure Site Recovery
agent will be installed.

22
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:53,090
on the VM and it will replicates the data
to the target region in a VMware to Azure

23
00:01:53,090 --> 00:02:00,100
scenario that requires an on premises
appliance and a mobility agent on the

24
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:07,320
virtual machines or a physical server for
a smooth migration and Hyper V to Azure.

25
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,840
It's even simpler with Azure
Site Recovery Provider.

26
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,320
And if you are dealing with
the physical servers, a setup

27
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,870
is similar to VMware using the
process to handle the replication.

28
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,630
This flexibility ensures that regardless
of your environment, ASR can fit.

29
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:30,415
into your disaster recovery strategy.

30
00:02:30,915 --> 00:02:34,585
Planning is a key to a disaster
recovery implementation.

31
00:02:34,985 --> 00:02:41,475
A solid framework includes understanding
which applications are mission

32
00:02:41,475 --> 00:02:46,844
critical by assessing the workloads
and validating the infrastructure.

33
00:02:46,965 --> 00:02:52,355
Making sure you have the bandwidth,
latency and the initial syncs

34
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:57,795
are optimized, and you can do
a testing failure scenarios.

35
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:02,954
Either it's a planned or unplanned or
a test failures to ensure everything

36
00:03:02,955 --> 00:03:09,854
works when it matters most, creating
a recovery runbooks, detailed step by

37
00:03:09,854 --> 00:03:12,434
step recovery guides to your teams.

38
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:14,334
This structured approach.

39
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:18,489
helps to eliminate surprises
during a real disaster.

40
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:21,619
Let's talk about the replication.

41
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:26,729
Azure Site Recovery uses multiple
strategies to keep the data in sync.

42
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,869
A real time block replication
mirrors the data as changes happen

43
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:35,299
and keeping the RPOs closer to zero.

44
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:43,340
Our intelligent push architecture
comprises and duplicates data and

45
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,120
reducing the network overhead.

46
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:52,039
Database to sync engine only transfers the
change data, optimizing the performance.

47
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:59,109
VSS integrated snapshots ensure that
applications like SQL and SAP remain

48
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:02,070
consistent during the failover.

49
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:07,179
This means organization can
maintain business continuity.

50
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:11,350
with a minimal data loss
and near instant recovery.

51
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:16,360
A recovery process and here where
things get really interesting.

52
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,950
Enterprise workloads using Azure
Site Recovery can achieve 15 minutes

53
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:28,350
RTOs and near real time 30 seconds
RPOs mean almost no data loss.

54
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:36,090
A customer can deploy Deployments
have shown 76 percent reduction in

55
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,520
downtime, which is a game changer.

56
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:45,560
ASR also integrates deeply with Azure
Monitor, Azure Automation, giving

57
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:51,889
you real time insights and failovers
and enterprise grade data protection.

58
00:04:52,519 --> 00:05:00,660
And, If you are running a mission critical
apps like SAP, Oracle or SQL, ASR ensures

59
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,700
they meet RTOs without missing a bit.

60
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,160
Let's talk a cost.

61
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,320
One of the biggest advantage of Azure
Site Recovery is the cost efficiency.

62
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,840
Traditional data recovery requires
a secondary data centers, dedicated

63
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,580
hardware, and a constant maintenance.

64
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:28,740
With ASR, 40 to 60 percent on disaster
recovery costs, thanks to pay as you go.

65
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,550
pricing and elimination of,
secondary site expenses.

66
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,980
And with a built in scalability,
business can protect up to 10,

67
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,840
000 incidents with auto scaling
and intelligent load balancing.

68
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,800
Key recommendation.

69
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,570
So what are the key takeaways?

70
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,290
of ensuring a successful
ASR implementation.

71
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,170
Comprehensive planning.

72
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,980
Start with well defined strategy.

73
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,720
Regular testing.

74
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:02,280
Validate your disaster recovery
plan with frequent failover drills.

75
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,780
Stop training.

76
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,240
Your team needs to be
confident in managing ASR.

77
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,080
Integrated monitoring.

78
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,570
Use a real time alert to stay
ahead of potential issues.

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,830
A well executed ASR plan can be
the difference between business

80
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,310
continuity and prolonged downtime.

81
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:27,430
Future directions and finally,
where is this all heading?

82
00:06:28,335 --> 00:06:33,775
We are seeing AI powered recovery
automations that predicts the

83
00:06:33,775 --> 00:06:35,495
failure before they happen.

84
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:40,515
Post quantum cryptographic
security to protect their data.

85
00:06:40,515 --> 00:06:47,575
Seamless edge to cloud disaster recovery,
ensuring IOT workloads are protected.

86
00:06:48,055 --> 00:06:53,575
And keep Kubernetes integration making
cloud native application disaster ready.

87
00:06:54,345 --> 00:06:56,435
With 99%.

88
00:06:56,655 --> 00:06:57,905
Recovery success rate.

89
00:06:58,245 --> 00:07:02,435
I just said recovery is the
front of enterprise disaster

90
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:04,555
recovery and business resilience.

91
00:07:05,055 --> 00:07:09,765
Disaster recovery isn't just
about reacting to outages.

92
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:13,115
It's about being prepared.

93
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:19,090
Minimizing downtime and ensuring business
continuity with Azure site recovery.

94
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,920
We are seeing organizations achieve
faster recoveries, lower cost and a

95
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,920
future proofed resilience strategy.

96
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,920
Thank you all for joining today.

97
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,700
I hope this session helps you
take more strategic approach

98
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,570
to modern disaster recovery.

99
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,820
Thank you once again.
