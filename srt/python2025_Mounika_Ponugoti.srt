00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,820
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:01,699
I'm Monika.

3
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:02,980
Thank you for joining me.

4
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,109
Today's talk is about enhancing
embedded device security,

5
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,690
a cost effective approach.

6
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,360
Embedded devices are essential
in our day to day life.

7
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,229
We are very much dependent
on them in every aspect.

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,029
they are in home automation.

9
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:23,139
Transportation and medical devices,
education there everywhere.

10
00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:28,639
However, these devices often like
the, the robo security measures, which

11
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:33,949
puts them, at risk, due to the cost
power and performance trade offs.

12
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:38,374
So in this talk, we are going to
discuss about some of the applications.

13
00:00:39,034 --> 00:00:42,204
we can use to improve the
security of these devices.

14
00:00:42,704 --> 00:00:47,274
Cyber criminals often target
the embedded devices which are

15
00:00:47,344 --> 00:00:51,944
in critical infrastructures, or
industrial systems or AOT systems.

16
00:00:52,314 --> 00:00:57,379
for example, you can think of flight
controls or it can be, A healthcare

17
00:00:57,379 --> 00:01:04,389
system, or it can be a gas pipeline, or it
can be any other which are very critical.

18
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,339
So often they try to exploit
the weaknesses through a for

19
00:01:09,339 --> 00:01:12,789
example, they may try like this
default password, the password.

20
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:17,799
Passwords, or they may exploit the
outdated firmware where they know that

21
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:24,019
this buffer overflows or stack overflows
or any other kind of issues are already

22
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,709
exist and they try to exploit those first.

23
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:34,814
a study shows that, 83 percent
of the embedded systems actually,

24
00:01:35,074 --> 00:01:36,594
lack the security features.

25
00:01:37,154 --> 00:01:43,214
so the breaches, which incur due to this,
lack of security features is very costly.

26
00:01:43,484 --> 00:01:48,444
Often organizations pay millions of
dollars because of the damages and

27
00:01:48,454 --> 00:01:50,954
as well as to recover, these systems.

28
00:01:51,454 --> 00:01:55,844
So to improve the security of the
embedded devices, it is crucial

29
00:01:55,894 --> 00:01:59,724
to, consider addressing the
known vulnerabilities as well.

30
00:02:00,304 --> 00:02:03,797
so secure core practicing, eliminates
the potential, vulnerabilities like a

31
00:02:03,797 --> 00:02:07,544
buffer overflows and memory corruptions.

32
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:12,414
secure boot mechanisms, helps to
enhance the security by blocking the

33
00:02:12,414 --> 00:02:14,374
unauthorized access to the software.

34
00:02:14,904 --> 00:02:19,374
and also, they, they validate the
authenticity of the firmware that is

35
00:02:19,374 --> 00:02:25,244
being executed, and this is very important
because otherwise, otherwise anyone

36
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:29,634
can inject the malicious code, during
the boot up, and then they corrupt the

37
00:02:29,644 --> 00:02:35,604
boot software or they can take control
of the device after the OS comes up.

38
00:02:36,164 --> 00:02:40,394
secure boot mechanisms can also
helps to mitigate, some of the,

39
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:45,494
some of the attacks, along with this
intrusion detection also helps to

40
00:02:45,494 --> 00:02:49,884
improve the network security where
it can detect the any suspicious

41
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:51,854
activities or possible attacks.

42
00:02:52,154 --> 00:02:56,024
It can alert the administrator
or even we can take automated

43
00:02:56,034 --> 00:02:59,174
actions to prevent any attacks.

44
00:02:59,674 --> 00:03:01,024
obfuscation also helps.

45
00:03:01,369 --> 00:03:07,509
to enhance the security of the devices
by, randomizing the symbol names

46
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:09,609
and the function calls in the code.

47
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:14,689
this, this, makes, harder for the
attacker to reverse engineer the

48
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:16,919
code to create, targeted attacks.

49
00:03:17,534 --> 00:03:22,034
To improve the robustness of the embedded
devices, it is important to consider

50
00:03:22,054 --> 00:03:24,094
other advanced security measures as well.

51
00:03:24,584 --> 00:03:29,244
for example, control flow integrity,
encryption of the code or, address space

52
00:03:29,244 --> 00:03:35,554
randomization, or we can, insert the stack
and erase or authenticate any dynamic,

53
00:03:35,874 --> 00:03:38,294
modules that are, dynamically loaded.

54
00:03:38,794 --> 00:03:44,424
Control flow integrity, helps with, helps
with, security because, It doesn't let the

55
00:03:44,454 --> 00:03:47,344
attacker to execute any part of the code.

56
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:53,284
control flow integrity makes sure
that only the validated execution

57
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:55,184
paths are actually executed.

58
00:03:55,774 --> 00:03:59,074
other than that, like any
other paths won't be executed.

59
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:03,034
attacker won't be jumped from one
part of the code to any part of

60
00:04:03,094 --> 00:04:07,154
the code, because it's prohibited
to do address space randomization.

61
00:04:07,654 --> 00:04:13,224
Helps, also helps because every time
the device is, boot up, every time

62
00:04:13,224 --> 00:04:17,754
the device boot up, the image kind of
loads it a different place in the ram.

63
00:04:17,994 --> 00:04:24,014
So it, it, it helps with the mitigating
certain kinds of attacks as well

64
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:29,444
as it also makes the, it also makes
it harder for the, attacker to.

65
00:04:29,944 --> 00:04:33,494
To create any targeted, attacks.

66
00:04:33,994 --> 00:04:38,574
Authenticating any, dynamically
loaded models is also very

67
00:04:38,574 --> 00:04:43,214
important, because otherwise,
attacker might include a malicious

68
00:04:43,214 --> 00:04:45,464
code as part of the dynamic models.

69
00:04:45,954 --> 00:04:49,464
also strictly controlling the
access to the parts of the

70
00:04:49,464 --> 00:04:51,294
memory by different models.

71
00:04:51,384 --> 00:04:54,729
When, there are like a multiple
system on trips is very.

72
00:04:55,239 --> 00:05:01,119
Important as well, because there are
sometimes if one of the component is

73
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:06,939
actually a compromise, it is highly
possible that through that attacker

74
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:13,199
might compromise the other component,
other devices on that chip as well.

75
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:18,409
So instead of that, if we can strictly
access the control, we can mitigate

76
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:20,629
some of the security attacks as well.

77
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:24,789
The other proactive measure to
improve the security, includes,

78
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:26,189
regularly updating the software.

79
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:31,919
for example, patching the software
regularly is, crucial, either to fix the

80
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,479
bugs or to fix any known security issues.

81
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:40,749
most of the time, cybercriminals
tries to exploit these unknown issues.

82
00:05:40,809 --> 00:05:44,499
So it's very important to,
close, those, known issues.

83
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:49,489
other techniques are like, address
sanitization and undefined behaviors,

84
00:05:49,489 --> 00:05:54,579
like sanitization at runtime, or also,
helps to mitigate some of the attacks.

85
00:05:54,609 --> 00:06:00,759
For example, sometimes attackers,
can craft, can craft The system to

86
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:05,749
run into undefined behavior and then
corrupt the memory so that they can

87
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:12,569
take control over it by enabling
these in the devices, we can make sure

88
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:18,199
that we are these any attacks which
are related to this are mitigated.

89
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:21,639
as discussed in the beginning,
the security of the embedded

90
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,029
devices is often trade off with
the performance and the cost.

91
00:06:25,549 --> 00:06:31,349
however, we can still prioritize the
security on these devices by conducting

92
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:36,939
the threat models to identify the
critical vulnerabilities and by, only

93
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:42,944
considering the restricted risk profiles,
which are actually, suitable for the,

94
00:06:43,214 --> 00:06:47,164
for these, embedded for the given
embedded device and as well as for a

95
00:06:47,164 --> 00:06:51,904
given, constraint, we can also consider
like improving the performance of

96
00:06:52,114 --> 00:06:56,914
these, secure algorithms or introducing
the, hardware, dedicated, hardware

97
00:06:56,914 --> 00:07:02,124
accelerators, for the cryptography related
things, or we can, Use the lightweight

98
00:07:02,684 --> 00:07:10,924
algorithms to reduce the load on the
embedded core and, uh, and also we

99
00:07:10,924 --> 00:07:14,744
can, utilize like existing environments
if there are any security issues.

100
00:07:15,654 --> 00:07:20,234
we can, use them or if there are
any trusted, trusted, trusted

101
00:07:20,234 --> 00:07:25,544
execution environments, we can use
them to maximize the protection, but

102
00:07:25,764 --> 00:07:27,904
without affecting the performance.

103
00:07:27,904 --> 00:07:33,344
Here are the list of different,
techniques that we have discussed,

104
00:07:33,404 --> 00:07:37,964
and these, techniques can be, rolled
out to the existing, embedded devices

105
00:07:38,654 --> 00:07:40,634
to reduce the attacking surfaces.

106
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:45,904
so with all these, different kinds
of method, it makes it, harder for

107
00:07:45,904 --> 00:07:50,934
the attacker to craft the cases,
specific to a, given device and

108
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:53,204
then, exploit those vulnerabilities.

109
00:07:53,664 --> 00:07:58,724
So these methods, these methods helps
to reduce the number of attacks.

110
00:07:59,224 --> 00:08:04,574
By collaboratively considering to,
considering the security by design, by

111
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:09,564
using the industry standard frameworks
and then using the scanning tools to

112
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:14,694
detect the vulnerabilities and also
threat modeling to detect any known,

113
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:19,304
known threats ahead of the time and
then, improve the code accordingly.

114
00:08:19,644 --> 00:08:23,924
And also by designing the
layered architecture to integrate

115
00:08:23,944 --> 00:08:25,594
the defense in, principles.

116
00:08:25,634 --> 00:08:29,714
And then by implementing the
secure protocols, we can reduce

117
00:08:29,754 --> 00:08:33,164
the, we can reduce the attacks
on this embedded systems.

118
00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:38,194
study shows that 80 percent of the
critical vulnerabilities are reduced

119
00:08:38,194 --> 00:08:40,844
by regular updates and, scanning.

120
00:08:41,264 --> 00:08:46,554
90 percent of the, attempted breaches were
blocked because of the enhanced protocols.

121
00:08:47,024 --> 00:08:50,774
now we can see that, these security
measures are, really important

122
00:08:50,814 --> 00:08:55,314
by incorporating at least, some
of these measures will really

123
00:08:55,324 --> 00:09:00,584
ensure that, embedded devices are
protected at least to some extent.

124
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:05,704
we can provide the confidence to
the users, by following this core

125
00:09:05,864 --> 00:09:09,364
principle where we can provide
the, robo security frameworks.

126
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:15,119
to protect the critical operations,
we can monitor the, systems in real

127
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:19,969
time to, for the, and provide the
security status and also provide

128
00:09:19,979 --> 00:09:21,359
the visibility into the systems.

129
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:26,149
we can also make sure that the mission
critical, environments are always,

130
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:28,219
performed, have a consistent performance.

131
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:33,564
this way we can, we can, Not only
just show that, security is going

132
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:37,444
to be, add on future, but it's
a foundation of everything that

133
00:09:37,804 --> 00:09:39,354
we do with the embedded systems.

134
00:09:39,854 --> 00:09:44,254
In conclusion, with the adoption of
security measures which are discussed

135
00:09:44,254 --> 00:09:48,824
in this talk, we can transform the
embedded systems from the vulnerabilities

136
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,144
into resilient technologies.

137
00:09:51,644 --> 00:09:56,834
We can enable a secure, intelligent,
and interconnected digital systems which

138
00:09:56,834 --> 00:09:58,564
are ready for the future challenges.

139
00:09:59,064 --> 00:10:03,634
The key takeaways from this talk are,
we can implement the robo security

140
00:10:03,634 --> 00:10:08,084
measures from the beginning of the
project itself, and, we can continuously

141
00:10:08,094 --> 00:10:13,564
monitor for regular, updates, for the,
security patches or implementing the

142
00:10:13,564 --> 00:10:20,834
security protocols or, updating, any
known, issues or, And also optimizing

143
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:25,494
the security, without compromising
the functionality, all, functionality.

144
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:30,614
we can also build a trust, with the user
by fostering the conference, through

145
00:10:30,624 --> 00:10:33,074
the transparency and the reliability.

146
00:10:33,074 --> 00:10:38,624
So the next actions that we would
need to take is assess our systems

147
00:10:38,784 --> 00:10:40,234
and then implement the best practices.

148
00:10:40,524 --> 00:10:45,664
Practices that suits the needs and without
impacting the performance of the systems.

149
00:10:46,564 --> 00:10:53,034
And also it is very important to stay up
to date on the current security trends

150
00:10:53,484 --> 00:10:55,964
and as well as the emerging threats.

151
00:10:56,464 --> 00:10:57,964
I hope you like my talk.

152
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:04,164
Thank you for giving me this
opportunity and have a very good day.
