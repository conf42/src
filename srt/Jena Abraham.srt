1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,869
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,270
Today I'll be discussing how machine
learning is transforming the landscape

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,250
of high speed protocol testing.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,879
We'll explore innovations in both hardware
and verification techniques and how

5
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:19,770
AI is driving new levels of efficiency
and accuracy in these critical areas.

6
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:25,990
Okay, so let's take a closer look
at the key challenges we face when

7
00:00:25,994 --> 00:00:28,594
verifying modern high speed protocols.

8
00:00:30,294 --> 00:00:35,155
As interface speeds increase in standards
evolve, our traditional methods of

9
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:37,394
verification are simply not keeping pace.

10
00:00:38,884 --> 00:00:41,274
First time is a major constraint.

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,729
Verification timelines are
shrinking while the complexity of

12
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:47,769
protocols is growing exponentially.

13
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,669
Traditional methodologies re rely heavily
on manual test creation and execution,

14
00:00:55,149 --> 00:01:00,519
which can't scale fast enough to meet
today's aggressive development cycles.

15
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,189
This results in longer debug cycles
and a high risk of missing critical

16
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:08,860
issues before tape out or release.

17
00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:16,179
Next, we have coverage gaps
despite having large test suites.

18
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:22,600
Conventional approaches often miss
rare edge cases, especially at protocol

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,969
boundaries or during state transitions.

20
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,679
These are precisely the areas where
critical failures occur in the

21
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:34,124
field, and catching them late in
the cycle can be extremely costly.

22
00:01:35,664 --> 00:01:40,675
The inability to guarantee full
state space coverage leaves a blind

23
00:01:40,675 --> 00:01:42,865
spot in overall system quality.

24
00:01:44,575 --> 00:01:47,455
Lastly, scaling is a growing problem.

25
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:55,225
Emerging standards like PCI Gen five,
gen six, USB four come with exponentially

26
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:59,710
more states configurations and timing
requirements than their predecessors.

27
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:06,325
Verifying, verifying them thoroughly
requires orders of magnitude.

28
00:02:06,414 --> 00:02:11,545
More test vectors and existing tools
or methods can't build to handle

29
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:13,495
that kind of scale efficiently,

30
00:02:14,495 --> 00:02:17,649
to effectively tackle the
challenges of protocol verification.

31
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,420
We have developed a Hy Hybrid
approach that combines the

32
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,369
strengths of formal methods, dynamic
simulation, and AI integration.

33
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:31,290
This layered strategy allows
us to maximize coverage,

34
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:35,159
accuracy, and efficiency in
validating high speed protocols.

35
00:02:36,884 --> 00:02:40,994
First, we use formal verification
to mathematically prove the

36
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,424
correctness of the protocol behavior.

37
00:02:44,384 --> 00:02:48,704
These techniques such as symbolic
execution and theorem proving

38
00:02:48,884 --> 00:02:53,105
are exhaustive, meaning they can
explore all possible states and

39
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:54,874
transitions within a protocol.

40
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,244
All a key strength here is
for zero false negatives.

41
00:03:00,994 --> 00:03:02,284
If the formal method.

42
00:03:03,185 --> 00:03:07,085
If the formal model passes, we are
guaranteed that certain classes

43
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:09,454
of bugs simply don't exist.

44
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:15,125
This is especially critical for ensuring
absolute compliance with protocol

45
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,984
specs at the architectural level.

46
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:24,185
Formal methods alone don't capture
real world hardware behavior, which

47
00:03:24,185 --> 00:03:26,555
is where dynamic simulation comes in.

48
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:29,165
Simulation continue.

49
00:03:29,765 --> 00:03:34,385
Simulation provides hardware accurate
testing, letting us observe how the

50
00:03:34,385 --> 00:03:39,995
implementation behaves under actual
traffic, variable timing conditions,

51
00:03:40,025 --> 00:03:42,485
and diverse system configurations.

52
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:49,925
It's essential for catching edge cases
that depend on electrical noise, race

53
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:52,145
conditions, or timing violations.

54
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,320
Scenarios, formal methods
may ab, ab abstract anyway.

55
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:04,475
So the third layer of our approach
is AI integration, which acts

56
00:04:04,475 --> 00:04:08,614
as a smart bridge between formal
and simulation environments.

57
00:04:09,754 --> 00:04:13,715
Machine learning algorithms
analyze verification results and

58
00:04:13,715 --> 00:04:16,534
dynamically adjust test priorities.

59
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:25,040
By using coverage data and prob
problematic fault models, AI helps

60
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,500
us focus on the areas most likely
to contain bugs significantly

61
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,230
improving verification efficiency.

62
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,560
This creates a feedback loop where
insights from simulation inform

63
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:45,050
formal analysis and vice versa,
continually refining the test process.

64
00:04:46,505 --> 00:04:51,034
By combining the precision of
formal methods, the realism of

65
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:56,345
simulation, and the adaptability of
ai, our hardware approach delivers

66
00:04:56,735 --> 00:05:01,745
a comprehensive, scalable solution
for high speed protocol verification.

67
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:09,184
This synergy allows us to achieve
faster time to coverage and higher

68
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,554
confidence in protocol compliance.

69
00:05:12,555 --> 00:05:17,625
Now let's look at the performance
impact of integrating FPGA acceleration

70
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,094
into our verification framework.

71
00:05:22,034 --> 00:05:27,854
These results de demonstrate how hardware
acceleration can dramatically improve the

72
00:05:27,854 --> 00:05:30,554
speed and scalability of protocol testing.

73
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:32,809
First, we achieved.

74
00:05:34,064 --> 00:05:40,094
85% reduction in overall verification time
compared to traditional CPU based methods.

75
00:05:41,084 --> 00:05:45,284
This is a game changer, especially
for teams working under tight

76
00:05:45,524 --> 00:05:47,454
time to market constraints.

77
00:05:48,234 --> 00:05:53,859
FP Gs allow us to offload
computationally intensive tasks such as.

78
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:59,049
Packet parsing protocol, state
monitoring and real time error

79
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:01,539
detection directly into hardware.

80
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:08,139
This result is significantly faster,
results in significantly faster test

81
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:10,779
execution without compromising accuracy.

82
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:14,469
Next, we have reached two.

83
00:06:16,884 --> 00:06:20,544
Operation Latencies, which
is a mega major breakthrough.

84
00:06:21,894 --> 00:06:26,564
This ultra low latency enables real
time protocol analysis where the

85
00:06:26,564 --> 00:06:32,594
system can react almost instantly
to protocol events or anomalies.

86
00:06:33,764 --> 00:06:37,844
It's particularly valuable for
debugging time sensitive issues and

87
00:06:37,844 --> 00:06:43,214
observing transient faults that might
be missed in slower environments.

88
00:06:45,164 --> 00:06:49,454
Finally, our 12 x increase in
trans transaction throughput is

89
00:06:49,454 --> 00:06:53,294
due to the inherent parallelism
in FPGA architectures.

90
00:06:54,254 --> 00:06:59,564
Unlike CPUs, which process
sequentially, FPGS can execute multiple

91
00:06:59,564 --> 00:07:04,844
verification tasks simultaneously,
making them ideal for handling high

92
00:07:04,844 --> 00:07:07,124
speed, high volume data streams.

93
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:09,399
This allows us to ra.

94
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:14,664
Run far more test vectors in
less time, covering a broader

95
00:07:14,664 --> 00:07:16,614
spectrum of protocol behavior.

96
00:07:18,114 --> 00:07:22,194
These results clearly show that
FPGA acceleration isn't just an

97
00:07:22,194 --> 00:07:27,114
optimization, it's an enabler for
next generation verification demands.

98
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:31,619
With faster execution, real
time responsiveness, and

99
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:33,149
massive increased throughput.

100
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,889
FPGAs unlock new possibilities
for scalable high

101
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:39,479
performance protocol testing.

102
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,109
So at the heart of our verification
framework is the AI driven

103
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,599
verification core, a powerful.

104
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:52,209
Engine that transforms how we
approach protocol validation.

105
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:57,849
It uses machine learning, not
just for automation, but for

106
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:01,359
intelligent decision making
throughout the verification process.

107
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:05,529
The core begins with
decision intelligence, where

108
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:08,474
problem prob problem models.

109
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:16,689
Problem models I use to predict high
risk, edge cases up to 94% of accuracy.

110
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,159
This allows us to eliminate
redundant test cases, focusing our

111
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:23,039
efforts where they matter most.

112
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:29,490
Instead of brute force testing, we
apply smart targeting, save both

113
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,679
time and computational resources.

114
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:38,714
Using deep learning algorithms, the system
continuously analyzes historical test data

115
00:08:38,714 --> 00:08:45,374
to uncover su subtle protocol violations
that might escape traditional checks.

116
00:08:46,185 --> 00:08:51,374
These could be timing anomalies,
rare sequence violations, or usage

117
00:08:51,374 --> 00:08:56,714
patterns that deviate from spec
but aren't immediately obvious.

118
00:08:58,124 --> 00:09:00,279
With this intelligence,
we can dynamically.

119
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:06,839
Prior prioritize test scenarios based
on likelihood of exposing hidden bugs.

120
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:13,770
The core continuously refines its
strategy, adapting to feedback from

121
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,260
ongoing simulations and formal analysis.

122
00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:23,280
Finally, AI enables semantic
coverage analysis, mapping each

123
00:09:23,344 --> 00:09:27,290
aspect of the protocol spec to
actual test scenarios or test cases.

124
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:32,359
This ensures a hundred percent
functional coverage, not just in

125
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:37,069
terms of code or state space, but
in how the system aligns with real

126
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:40,109
world protocol, behavior, and intent.

127
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,229
It also helps identify coverage
blind spots early, reducing the

128
00:09:46,229 --> 00:09:49,050
risk of missed issues in production.

129
00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:56,249
In summary, our AI driven
verification core delivers faster.

130
00:09:56,594 --> 00:09:59,144
Smarter and more thorough testing by com.

131
00:09:59,234 --> 00:10:03,854
Combining predictive analysis,
learning from experience, and actively

132
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:05,954
guiding the verification process.

133
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:12,789
It's a major step forward from static
rule-based verification toward a truly

134
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:15,629
adaptive, intelligent led methodology.

135
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:20,229
So this slide outlines how we've
implemented supervised learning to

136
00:10:20,229 --> 00:10:26,259
enhance our verification workflow by
learning from historical verification

137
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:27,534
out outcomes we have built.

138
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,275
Models that predict and prioritize
the most impactful test ca test,

139
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:33,930
test vectors or test cases.

140
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,790
Again streamlining the entire process.

141
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:42,069
So we first start with a
large data set compiled from

142
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:44,140
historical verification results.

143
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,800
This includes both
passing and failing cases.

144
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,470
What sets our approach apart?

145
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:56,104
Is the expert driven classification
of past defects, which provides

146
00:10:56,104 --> 00:10:59,344
meaningful context and labels
for the learning process.

147
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:05,435
This label data gives the model a
deep understanding of what constitutes

148
00:11:05,435 --> 00:11:10,265
a meaningful protocol violation and
what patterns typically lead to them.

149
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:16,974
For each protocol, we use custom neural
network architectures tuned to unique.

150
00:11:17,424 --> 00:11:22,464
Characteristics of that network,
such as timing parameters or timing

151
00:11:22,674 --> 00:11:27,684
patterns like you call it, sequence
behavior or encoding anomalies.

152
00:11:28,284 --> 00:11:35,424
We also apply advanced hyper parameter
tuning to optimize for both prediction

153
00:11:35,424 --> 00:11:40,344
accuracy and model generalization,
ensuring that the model isn't just

154
00:11:40,464 --> 00:11:44,874
memorizing past failures, but truly
learning how to anticipate new ones.

155
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:50,709
Once trained, these models are
deployed via lightweight inference

156
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:54,999
engines within the en, within
the verification environment.

157
00:11:55,569 --> 00:12:00,459
They identify high yield test vectors,
those most likely to uncover bugs

158
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,699
with an impressive 97% precision.

159
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:08,944
And because this is a self-improving
system, it continuously.

160
00:12:09,744 --> 00:12:15,424
Updates and refines its predictions with
every new round of verification data.

161
00:12:17,164 --> 00:12:22,204
This creates a closed learning loop that
gets smarter and more efficient over time.

162
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:29,434
In summary, our supervised
learning implementation transforms

163
00:12:29,434 --> 00:12:34,024
historical verification knowledge
into real time predictive power.

164
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:39,139
It's a strategic upgrade from
reactive testing to proactive,

165
00:12:39,229 --> 00:12:43,729
intelligent verification, ensuring
we spend time where it matters most.

166
00:12:44,684 --> 00:12:44,804
I.

167
00:12:45,804 --> 00:12:51,174
So one of the most time consuming aspects
of protocol verification is generating

168
00:12:51,174 --> 00:12:53,754
effective and comprehensive test cases.

169
00:12:54,804 --> 00:13:00,084
A solution uses machine learning powered
test generation, which significantly out.

170
00:13:00,349 --> 00:13:04,129
Outperforms traditional,
manual or rule-based methods.

171
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:09,259
Traditionally, test generation
relies on expert written scenarios

172
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:11,179
or constrained random techniques.

173
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:16,129
These methods can be slow,
redundant, and often mis edge

174
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:22,299
cases, especially in high complex
protocols with massive state spaces.

175
00:13:24,224 --> 00:13:28,604
Our system uses machine learning
algorithms to learn from prior test

176
00:13:28,604 --> 00:13:30,974
results and protocol specifications.

177
00:13:32,054 --> 00:13:36,764
It automatically generates test cases
that are both relevant and high impact,

178
00:13:37,454 --> 00:13:41,654
focusing on areas likely to reveal
hidden bugs or unverified behavior.

179
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:49,274
What sets our approach apart is that
it excels in both volume and precision.

180
00:13:49,304 --> 00:13:54,554
We are able to generate far more test
vectors in a short time while maintaining

181
00:13:54,554 --> 00:14:00,494
a high signal to noise ratio, meaning
fewer redundant or low value tests.

182
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:05,474
This leads to more efficient
simulations, faster coverage

183
00:14:05,474 --> 00:14:10,259
closure, and a higher likelihood
of uncovering critical bugs early.

184
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:18,094
The system also adapts as as verification
progresses dynamically adjusting

185
00:14:18,094 --> 00:14:22,834
its output based on gaps in coverage
and feedback from failed tests.

186
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:28,774
It's a li, it's a living learning
test generator that evolves with the

187
00:14:28,774 --> 00:14:31,504
design and verification process itself.

188
00:14:32,734 --> 00:14:38,104
In summary, our automated test generation
system delivers smarter, faster, and

189
00:14:38,104 --> 00:14:45,164
more complex, a more complete coverage f
freeing engineering teams from repetitive

190
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:50,144
test development and allowing them to
focus on deeper analysis and debugging.

191
00:14:51,144 --> 00:14:55,874
So this this slide breaks down the
custom neural network architecture we've

192
00:14:55,874 --> 00:14:57,884
designed for protocol verification.

193
00:14:58,484 --> 00:15:02,834
It's built from a ground up to
handle the unique demands of high

194
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:07,244
speed interface testing, combining
deep learning techniques with

195
00:15:07,244 --> 00:15:09,374
protocol specific intelligence.

196
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,929
So the first part is the input layer.

197
00:15:14,109 --> 00:15:19,329
The input layer is ca carefully crafted to
capture a rich and relevant feature set.

198
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:24,849
It includes protocol specific
PA parameters, such as encoding

199
00:15:24,849 --> 00:15:28,419
schemes, error checking rules,
and RU and flow control.

200
00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:34,239
We also feed in precise timing and
synchronization data, essential for

201
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:37,659
identifying timing related violations.

202
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:41,889
Another key input is the
vector of state transitions.

203
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:45,519
These represent the full
behavior model of the.

204
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:50,349
Of the protocol, allowing the network
to understand expected sequences.

205
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:56,859
Finally, we aggregate historical defect
patterns, giving the model context

206
00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:59,229
from past issues and their signatures.

207
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,109
Next we look at the hidden layers.

208
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:04,819
In the hidden layers.

209
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:07,879
We leverage a mix of
deep learning techniques.

210
00:16:09,214 --> 00:16:15,454
So we look at T cns, which is the
temporal conation networks that are

211
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:20,344
used for pattern recognition across
time series data, which is typical

212
00:16:20,344 --> 00:16:22,804
in waveform and transaction streams.

213
00:16:24,454 --> 00:16:30,454
Bidirectional LLS TMS allow the model
to understand protocol behavior in

214
00:16:30,454 --> 00:16:35,704
both forward and backwards sequence
flows critical for protocols with.

215
00:16:36,065 --> 00:16:38,525
Complex handshake or error recovery.

216
00:16:39,785 --> 00:16:41,285
Multi-head attention.

217
00:16:41,885 --> 00:16:46,895
MEChA mechanisms help the model focus
on specific parts of the sequence,

218
00:16:46,895 --> 00:16:51,775
such as state transitions, where
violations are most likely to occur.

219
00:16:52,704 --> 00:16:58,675
We also use fully connected layers
in high dimensions to allow the allow

220
00:16:58,675 --> 00:17:04,105
for complex feature interactions and
decision making at a semantic level.

221
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:07,629
So lastly, the output layer.

222
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:17,500
This layer supports multi key verification
tasks, such as prioritizing test vector

223
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,869
generation with each test ranked by
a confidence scoreboard on predicted.

224
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:29,200
Impact and risk predictive coverage
mapping which highlights which parts

225
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,870
of the protocol spec are insufficiently
tested or missing altogether, real

226
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:40,060
time violation detection, where
the model can flag anomalies as

227
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,800
they occur during simulation.

228
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:48,115
And a statistical probability
distribution for likely defect types of

229
00:17:48,115 --> 00:17:53,155
protocol failure categories, enabling
smarter debugging and reporting.

230
00:17:54,655 --> 00:17:58,965
This architecture isn't just about
prediction, it's about driving.

231
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,210
Actionable intelligence into
the verification process.

232
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:10,470
It helps us test smarter, identify issues
earlier, and ultimately ensure high

233
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,750
protocol reliability and compliance.

234
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:19,069
Yeah, this is just a slide which
talks about specific results of

235
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:26,339
different protocols like PCIE five,
USP four, ddr, R five H, DM I 2.1.

236
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:28,029
The different protocols.

237
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:29,399
These are all the high speed.

238
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,974
Protocols that have, that
are being used in these days.

239
00:18:33,694 --> 00:18:39,534
And, how we have been able to reduce the
time that is needed for like generating,

240
00:18:39,534 --> 00:18:44,264
or basically testing, like generating, as
well as testing out all these different

241
00:18:44,264 --> 00:18:49,264
cases as we have, as I have explained in
the previous slides it also gives you a

242
00:18:49,264 --> 00:18:54,830
chart of how coverage, where, how much
of coverage we get out of our our the.

243
00:18:56,925 --> 00:19:00,045
The neural network that I was talking
about, the algorithms that we've put

244
00:19:00,045 --> 00:19:04,725
in place, so how it actually helps
with coverage and also bug detection.

245
00:19:04,775 --> 00:19:09,935
With this, instead of going in for east
spins are generally so expensive, this

246
00:19:09,935 --> 00:19:13,945
is very good for bug detection because
you keep running, you keep learning.

247
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:17,605
The system keeps learning and keeps
running those tests, which have

248
00:19:17,605 --> 00:19:20,135
which have sourced bugs in the past.

249
00:19:20,495 --> 00:19:25,325
So it's a good repetitive process of
finding out where the bugs really recite

250
00:19:25,325 --> 00:19:27,365
and regressing the system further.

251
00:19:28,365 --> 00:19:32,055
So in this slide, we focus on how
feature selection is handled by

252
00:19:32,055 --> 00:19:34,305
our AI driven verification system.

253
00:19:35,505 --> 00:19:40,785
Feature selection is critical for
ensuring we focus on the most impactful

254
00:19:40,785 --> 00:19:45,735
protocol parameters, enabling more
efficient and effective testing.

255
00:19:46,725 --> 00:19:50,985
First, we use advanced machine
learning algorithms to analyze

256
00:19:50,985 --> 00:19:52,815
the protocol specifications.

257
00:19:53,475 --> 00:19:57,615
The goal is to automatically identify
and extract the most critical

258
00:19:57,615 --> 00:20:00,225
parameters that need to be verified.

259
00:20:01,605 --> 00:20:04,395
These could include packet
types, state transitions, timing

260
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,240
sequences, or error conditions.

261
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:13,035
By intelligently focusing on these key
parameters, we reduce the amount of

262
00:20:13,065 --> 00:20:18,285
irrelevant data being processed, ensuring
a more targeted verification approach.

263
00:20:19,215 --> 00:20:23,625
The system then moves to correl
correlation detection, where it

264
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:28,065
uncovers complex relationships
between verification variables.

265
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:34,080
For example, it might find that certain
protocol violations only happen under

266
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,030
specific timing conditions, or when
specific combinations of inputs occur.

267
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,640
Recognizing these interdependencies allows
the system to generate tests that explore

268
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:50,100
edge cases, scenarios that are critical,
but often missed in conventional testing.

269
00:20:52,005 --> 00:20:56,025
Once correlations are detected, the
system applies feature ranking to

270
00:20:56,025 --> 00:20:58,335
prioritize verification parameters.

271
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:04,485
Each parameter is ranked based on its
impact on overall protocol coverage

272
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:06,885
and its potential to uncover defects.

273
00:21:07,905 --> 00:21:12,825
This ensures that the most critical
parameters are tested first, improving

274
00:21:12,825 --> 00:21:16,395
the efficiency and effectiveness
of the verification process.

275
00:21:17,385 --> 00:21:19,925
Finally, the system is self-optimizing.

276
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:23,195
It continually refines its
feature selection strategy

277
00:21:23,195 --> 00:21:24,995
as verification progresses.

278
00:21:26,015 --> 00:21:32,285
With each test, itration, new insights are
incorporated, allowing the system to adapt

279
00:21:32,285 --> 00:21:34,955
and evolve its approach based on real.

280
00:21:35,315 --> 00:21:36,605
Real time findings.

281
00:21:37,715 --> 00:21:42,875
This dynamic refinement allows, ensures
that the test coverage always remains

282
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:47,465
comprehensive and test resources are
directed where they're needed most.

283
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:54,305
In summary, feature selection intelligence
enhances our verification process by

284
00:21:54,305 --> 00:21:58,505
ensuring that we focus on the most
critical parameters and edge cases.

285
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:03,715
This intelligent data driven
approach leads to smarter testing,

286
00:22:03,774 --> 00:22:07,595
better coverage, and ultimately
more reliable protocol validation.

287
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:08,625
Okay.

288
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:15,365
Lastly this is in conclusion as we look
to the future, the role of AI and machine

289
00:22:15,365 --> 00:22:20,195
learning in hardware verification will
only continue to grow, making the process

290
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,685
smarter, faster, and more adaptable.

291
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:29,240
Let's explore three key trends shaping the
next generation of hardware verification.

292
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:35,060
First, we are moving towards enhanced
ML integration, especially with

293
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,280
the use of reinforcement learning.

294
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:42,290
Reinforcement learning will allow
our verification systems to self

295
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:45,365
optimize over time learning.

296
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:51,440
Self optimize over time learning the
most efficient test strategies based

297
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,480
on feedback from each test cycle.

298
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,820
In addition, predictive models will
advance to a point where they can

299
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:05,900
anticipate potential design flaws before
a protocol can even be implemented,

300
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,425
reducing costly post design fixes.

301
00:23:10,425 --> 00:23:15,975
Essentially this means we'll catch issues
earlier, saving both time and resources,

302
00:23:15,975 --> 00:23:19,365
while improving design reliability.

303
00:23:20,925 --> 00:23:25,845
Another exciting development is
cross protocol intelligence as

304
00:23:25,845 --> 00:23:27,945
different protocol types evolve.

305
00:23:27,975 --> 00:23:33,915
Like ethernet P-C-I-E-U-S-P, we will
see knowledge transfer between domains.

306
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:36,585
This means insights gained from.

307
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,520
Verifying one protocol can be
applied to another, accelerating

308
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:48,765
the entire verification process Over
time we'll start seeing universal

309
00:23:48,765 --> 00:23:50,625
verification patterns emerge.

310
00:23:50,655 --> 00:23:55,605
Simplifying the testing process across
diverse interface types and making

311
00:23:55,605 --> 00:23:57,915
it easier to validate new protocols.

312
00:23:59,235 --> 00:24:04,695
Finally, we are heading toward a
verification driven design paradigm.

313
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:09,360
AI Insights will no
longer be a afterthought.

314
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:09,690
Tale.

315
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:17,520
Actively guide hardware design from the
outset by shifting verification left.

316
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,350
In other words, moving it earlier in
the development timeline, designers will

317
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:27,240
have instant feedback on the robustness
and correctness of their designs.

318
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,260
This will not only help to
identify issues earlier.

319
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:36,975
But also drive more reliable,
optimized hardware from the very

320
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,925
beginning of the design process.

321
00:24:40,665 --> 00:24:42,315
So in conclusion, the hardware.

322
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:47,085
The future of the hardware verification
is deeply intertwined with AI

323
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:50,775
and ml enhanced ML integration.

324
00:24:50,775 --> 00:24:55,065
Cross-functional intelligence and a
verification driven design approach

325
00:24:55,065 --> 00:25:02,235
will re revolutionize how we approach
hardware validation leading to faster,

326
00:25:02,235 --> 00:25:04,485
smarter, and more reliable designs.

327
00:25:05,485 --> 00:25:06,445
Thank you for your time.
