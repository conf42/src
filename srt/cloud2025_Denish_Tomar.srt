00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,000
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:03,560
Welcome to my talk today.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,920
We are going to talk about something
amazing, something cool, something

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,660
that I think we all struggle with at
some point that is cloud complexity.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,239
Before we dive in, let
me introduce myself.

6
00:00:16,145 --> 00:00:19,105
My name is Dennis Thoma, and
I am a dev rel at Kumulos.

7
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:24,065
That means I spend my time helping
developers like you navigating

8
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:28,004
cloud native technologies,
simplify infrastructure, and most

9
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:32,005
importantly, avoid unexpected
cloud build that make your CFO cry.

10
00:00:32,614 --> 00:00:33,745
So let's jump right in.

11
00:00:34,245 --> 00:00:36,364
All right, let's talk about chaos.

12
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:40,664
Who here has deployed something to the
cloud thinking it's a small update?

13
00:00:41,115 --> 00:00:43,595
And boom, your select
notification explodes.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,010
Yeah, it's happened to me.

15
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,670
One morning, I pushed what I
thought was a simple change.

16
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,430
Within few minutes, alert was firing
off like a New Year Eve's firework show.

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,290
And we all know that the worst
part will at the end of the month.

18
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,580
And, cloud building can sometimes
feel like a mystery novel.

19
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,440
You never know the ending,
what is going to happen.

20
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:12,470
And, as you can see in this slide, there
is a picture which shows before and after.

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,960
And in my case, before was a nightmare
of hidden cost and confusions.

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,200
I thought that it, this can't be right.

23
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,410
This was when I knew I
had to find a better way.

24
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,540
So, this was my wake up call.

25
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,330
Cloud itself isn't the problem.

26
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,920
It's how we manage it.

27
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,980
I realized we need only three things.

28
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:39,695
First one is Transparency, like
know exactly what we are paying for.

29
00:01:40,195 --> 00:01:46,405
And second one is simplicity, like
cut down complexity in configurations.

30
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:49,205
And last one is flexibility.

31
00:01:50,035 --> 00:01:52,345
No vendor logins and no more headaches.

32
00:01:52,985 --> 00:01:55,915
Imagine this full visibility
into your cloud resources.

33
00:01:56,365 --> 00:01:58,445
Like turning on the
light in the dark room.

34
00:01:58,945 --> 00:02:01,135
It was sudden realization for me also.

35
00:02:01,895 --> 00:02:07,315
Like it was like switching from an old
telephone to the latest smartphone.

36
00:02:08,025 --> 00:02:11,975
As you can see on this slide, there
is a picture which shows you are

37
00:02:11,975 --> 00:02:16,795
going from old telephone to latest
smartphone in the digital world.

38
00:02:17,295 --> 00:02:21,235
And suddenly I was in control
instead of my cloud controlling.

39
00:02:21,735 --> 00:02:24,075
So this is where Cumulus comes in.

40
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,290
Let me tell, let me tell you
about our real world case.

41
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:33,554
One of our clown client was
struggling with unpredictable cost.

42
00:02:33,845 --> 00:02:35,085
and multiple vendors.

43
00:02:35,965 --> 00:02:40,275
Every month was a surprise bill for
him and that's not good for him.

44
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:47,435
With QMLESS, we switched to our model
to the fixed cost and no metering model.

45
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:53,515
Instead of getting bill for every single
operations or every single resources,

46
00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:59,465
we used a simple predictable unit based
system called QMS, QMLESS Compound Unit.

47
00:02:59,965 --> 00:03:03,425
It was like turning a chaotic
file of papers into a neatly

48
00:03:03,455 --> 00:03:04,715
organized filling cabinet.

49
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:09,365
And like, switching from paper
minute font plan to unlimited data.

50
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:14,295
suddenly cloud spending became as
predictable as Netflix subscriptions.

51
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:19,435
After everything, I learned that
I have come with three colder

52
00:03:19,585 --> 00:03:21,145
suits for the cloud sanity.

53
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:23,135
First one is simplify.

54
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:26,285
Complexity doesn't, does
not make you smarter.

55
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,534
It's just make you troubleshooting harder.

56
00:03:29,265 --> 00:03:32,924
Imagine this is a assembling
IKEA furniture without the

57
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:34,784
manual, but with not the fun.

58
00:03:35,785 --> 00:03:37,385
And the second one is transparent.

59
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:41,345
You wouldn't order food at the restaurant
if they refused to show you prices.

60
00:03:42,235 --> 00:03:44,265
Could cloud should work the same thing.

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,070
And the last one is, stay flexible.

62
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,270
No vendor should own your
infrastructure choices.

63
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,800
Keep your options open just
like keeping backup snacks in

64
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,320
your case of meal disappoint.

65
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:03,249
The benefits are like less
stress, predictable budgets, and

66
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,140
more time for the innovations.

67
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:06,810
Who wouldn't want this?

68
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,670
Of course, we all want this.

69
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,895
And so At the end, here's
the takeaway key points.

70
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:17,615
The cloud doesn't have
to be a source of stress.

71
00:04:18,405 --> 00:04:22,445
With the transparency, simplified
management, and the freedom to

72
00:04:22,485 --> 00:04:27,044
choose what's best for us, we
can turn into a powerful ally.

73
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:33,355
As the cumulus says, that cumulus shows
us that it's not about fighting the cloud.

74
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,789
It's about mastering it and like,
as you can see in this slide,

75
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,700
there is a guy who is thinking
what is happening on the earth.

76
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,619
And after he get know about the
cumulus, now he is just a chill guy.

77
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,430
He can enjoy by himself.

78
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,260
So thank you.

79
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,820
All right, let's wrap up this.

80
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,670
I hope you enjoyed my talk
and found it eye opening.

81
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:05,259
