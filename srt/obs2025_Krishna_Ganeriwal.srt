1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,045
Hey everyone, this is Krishna Gal. I'm
a senior software engineer working at

2
00:00:05,045 --> 00:00:07,535
Meta in the ads privacy infra team.

3
00:00:08,045 --> 00:00:12,755
I work closely in the intersection
of privacy, infrastructure and

4
00:00:12,755 --> 00:00:14,795
scalable distributed systems at Meta.

5
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:18,945
Today I'll walk you through
why observability is becoming

6
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:21,975
absolutely foundational to
privacy aware infrastructures,

7
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,645
especially at hyper massive scale.

8
00:00:25,145 --> 00:00:26,915
Like the ones being dealt at.

9
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:27,965
Big tech companies.

10
00:00:28,355 --> 00:00:31,925
We'll talk about the challenges,
architectural patterns, real world

11
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:36,615
examples from companies like Meta and
what the future looks like in this domain.

12
00:00:37,115 --> 00:00:39,815
And that's what the agenda here covers.

13
00:00:39,934 --> 00:00:44,935
We'll also go over the key use cases
that we have in privacy systems from

14
00:00:44,935 --> 00:00:48,864
the perspective of observability
and also the architectural

15
00:00:48,864 --> 00:00:50,485
patterns, benefits, and other.

16
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:53,355
Major advancements in this area.

17
00:00:53,855 --> 00:00:56,075
So now what are privacy aware systems?

18
00:00:56,415 --> 00:00:59,925
Privacy aware systems were
initially designed to ensure that

19
00:00:59,925 --> 00:01:01,725
user data is handled correctly.

20
00:01:02,205 --> 00:01:07,325
It's very important in today's age to
be aware and also respect the user's

21
00:01:07,325 --> 00:01:10,815
consent in handling user data across.

22
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,460
Service or a whole company stack as well.

23
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,610
Since privacy and regulations are
tightening every day across multiple

24
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:24,999
countries, these, the systems are a
part of a broader initiative, which

25
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:29,169
is also called Privacy Aware, infra
across the industry, which aims to

26
00:01:29,169 --> 00:01:33,159
embed privacy deeply into the technical
fabric of the company's infra.

27
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,909
Now, what does observability mean?

28
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:36,210
Observability.

29
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:41,210
In systems engineering, it meant
inferring in internal system

30
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,949
states from external outputs.

31
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:48,629
That includes three primarily key
pillars, logs, metrics, and traces

32
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:53,519
In privacy, infra specifically, it's
about reconstructing who touched a

33
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,004
user's data y and whether they were
allowed to touch that user data.

34
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,399
Think of it as the ability to
reconstruct a privacy black box

35
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,469
recording for every interaction.

36
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:09,479
That's critical when regulators or
users ask What happened to my data?

37
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,459
That's exactly what observability
helps tackle in case of privacy

38
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,559
aware infra coming to why privacy
aware info needs observability.

39
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:20,669
Data privacy today is under.

40
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:28,289
Regulatory scrutiny some of which are
G-D-P-R-C-C-P-A, India's DPDP, and now.

41
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:31,429
These fines are really high.

42
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:34,789
If you're caught not complying to
these regulations, it could be up to

43
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:38,209
4% of your global company revenue.

44
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:41,299
But what's more important
than fines is trust.

45
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:45,649
Your customers or users would just
stop trusting your services if you

46
00:02:45,649 --> 00:02:51,069
do not handle and respect their
privacy well, and it's not embedded

47
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:52,649
well in your company's infra.

48
00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:55,939
But that's more important
than fines and user trust.

49
00:02:56,469 --> 00:03:01,599
It's also very important for a company to
be able to answer to their customers who

50
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,389
access their data, what is going on with
their data and where it's being used for.

51
00:03:05,899 --> 00:03:10,219
That's where observability comes
in, not just for uptime or latency,

52
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:14,209
but to trace audit and enforce
data policies in real time.

53
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:15,979
Real time is the key here.

54
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,739
Now we'll touch upon a few.

55
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:21,714
Really important key use
cases in the privacy world.

56
00:03:21,864 --> 00:03:26,844
In terms of your observability there
are five real world use cases that we

57
00:03:26,844 --> 00:03:28,884
encounter on a daily basis at scale.

58
00:03:29,464 --> 00:03:34,084
First is data lineage, which is basically
tracking the entire flow of user data.

59
00:03:34,904 --> 00:03:38,264
It could start from where was
it generated, who processed it,

60
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:40,004
and was it shared externally?

61
00:03:40,899 --> 00:03:44,919
The other use case is consent
propagation, which is basically if a

62
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:47,379
user re revokes their consent in one ui.

63
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,519
We need to ensure all systems
respond to that in real time.

64
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:54,909
One lagging cache could
cause a compliance failure.

65
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:58,959
To give you an example, for instance,
if a user is okay with sharing their

66
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,479
location for showing, let's say,
personalized ads to them, and later

67
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:09,199
they go and update their, settings
to not share their location anymore.

68
00:04:09,619 --> 00:04:14,719
We have to make sure that for whatever
cases their location was being used

69
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:19,409
for, let's say for some kind of data
modeling or some kind of machine learning

70
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:21,719
model or training use cases, right?

71
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:25,709
We have to go and make sure that
the user's location data is wiped

72
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:27,599
out from those models completely.

73
00:04:27,929 --> 00:04:29,609
That's what consent propagation is.

74
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:32,654
The other use case is purpose limitation.

75
00:04:32,684 --> 00:04:35,834
Data collected for personalization
should not be used for targeting

76
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:39,014
or training ML models, as I
said, without explicit consent.

77
00:04:39,774 --> 00:04:42,834
The other use case that we can
think of is anomaly detection,

78
00:04:43,224 --> 00:04:47,304
for instance, login from a new
location or accessing full history.

79
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:48,989
Are these use cases expected?

80
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,969
Is there a policy mismatch somewhere?

81
00:04:51,179 --> 00:04:51,509
All these.

82
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,129
Questions could be answered really
well if there's a very well oiled

83
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:00,489
observability machine embedded
in the whole privacy scenario.

84
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,829
And then the last use case that I
could come up with is policy drift

85
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:08,249
monitoring, which is basically
over time does enforcement.

86
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:12,419
We can, our system silently
bypassing updated constraints.

87
00:05:12,924 --> 00:05:16,644
All these questions should be
answerable via privacy of our infra

88
00:05:17,124 --> 00:05:20,544
and without observability, it's not
possible to answer these questions.

89
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:24,534
Each of these need traceability
or adaptability, and in many

90
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:26,994
cases, automated enforcement.

91
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:32,824
Now coming to what other system design
challenges at implementing observability

92
00:05:32,824 --> 00:05:35,204
at such a big scale of privacy infra.

93
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:36,959
First is volume.

94
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:39,959
At hyperscale, you are dealing
with billions of log events

95
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,879
daily and petabytes of data.

96
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:45,929
To be able to process all of
this and generate meaningful

97
00:05:46,619 --> 00:05:50,739
observability out of this whole
privacy data is a massive challenge.

98
00:05:51,369 --> 00:05:52,779
The second part is speed.

99
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:58,669
In this case, you could, you cannot
take hours or days to process this

100
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,919
data since most of these services
that a lot of these billion.

101
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:07,249
Customer companies deal
with are realtime use cases.

102
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:13,459
So you need to handle and observability
at the speed of subsecond latency.

103
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:18,279
The other design challenge that one
needs to deal with is granularity.

104
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:23,169
Observability must be at a per user
level, not just per system level.

105
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:29,089
Since every user's privacy settings,
privacy comfort is very different.

106
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:31,759
It also depends on the
ecosystem they are in.

107
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:36,019
So it has to happen at a per use user
in some cases per impression level.

108
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,109
The last part is security.

109
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,459
Observability data itself is very
sensitive since it contains a

110
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:46,329
lot of information about how the
user interacted with the system,

111
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:49,194
details about the user et cetera.

112
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:53,394
So it must not leak PII or
personally identifiable information.

113
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:57,939
As it'll amplify the risk further
and be a loss at compliance.

114
00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:01,089
So we need to design the speed,
scale, and security all at once.

115
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:05,219
Coming to what the architectural patterns
you've observed in this industry.

116
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:09,659
So to be able to build observability
for privacy, the first thing

117
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:11,129
is event driven lineage.

118
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:17,199
We use services or systems such as
Kafka or any kind of pub sub, system

119
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,969
to track data flows in real time.

120
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:23,409
The second part of the co whole
ecosystem is consent aware tagging

121
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:29,849
where we try to map every data payload
to a specific purpose and scope.

122
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:36,089
By pur, what I mean by purpose and scope
here is we mark every data with what

123
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,489
kind of systems can absorb that data.

124
00:07:38,489 --> 00:07:40,109
For instance, if it's.

125
00:07:41,004 --> 00:07:46,764
An ads ecosystem and a user has revoked
their cons, has not given their consent

126
00:07:47,184 --> 00:07:51,054
to the service to use it, to use,
let's say, their location for it.

127
00:07:51,474 --> 00:07:57,594
We have to tag their location data to not
be specifically used for ad systems and

128
00:07:57,624 --> 00:07:59,934
maybe be able to use it for other systems.

129
00:07:59,934 --> 00:08:02,364
So consentable tagging
is very important here.

130
00:08:02,874 --> 00:08:04,944
The third part is embedded policy engines.

131
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:09,769
There has to be a lot of runtime guard
checks if data access aligns with consent.

132
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,279
The fourth part is
cryptographic audit trails.

133
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,210
Maybe use Merkel trees or blockchain
style structures for immutable verifiable

134
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:23,420
logs which help in audit trails and are
also cryptographic at the same time too.

135
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,599
As we spoke.

136
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,995
Observability itself is a very
sensitive privacy use case.

137
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:33,320
These patterns are not just theoretical,
they're being deployed in production by

138
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,780
privacy focused teams across Vic Tech.

139
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,360
Now, coming to some of the case studies
especially lineage data lineage at scale,

140
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,630
take to take an example of let's say meta.

141
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:48,500
Linear systems track data across
thousands of internal sources.

142
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,270
Consent status propagates within
the data and policy engines enforce

143
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,460
compliance throughout these data sources.

144
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,300
These systems power realtime
visualizations of how data moves

145
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:04,845
and are used by auditors, legal and
engineering teams alike to be able to.

146
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:11,540
Figure out if there's any kind of privacy
leaks or if there's any kind of policy

147
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,440
dilution or if there's any kind of misses.

148
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,775
All these things are enabled through
observability at such massive hyperscale.

149
00:09:20,775 --> 00:09:25,215
What used to take days of queuing
logs is now automated in real time.

150
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:32,235
This enables almost a 40 to 50% reduction
in audit prep time across several inter

151
00:09:32,295 --> 00:09:39,085
internal teams at meta if applied at in
the right ways using observability for

152
00:09:39,085 --> 00:09:41,465
such privacy aware infras structures.

153
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:45,215
Now, what are the benefits
of privacy observability?

154
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:49,775
Faster audits as we spoke about
it, reduce which reduce compliance

155
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:53,135
friction, and build confidence
with not just the regulators, but

156
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:55,625
with legal, with customers itself.

157
00:09:56,545 --> 00:10:01,025
They enable reduced fine risk which
basically helps in early detection

158
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:05,945
of misuse of what, and he hence
prohibit any kind of escalation.

159
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:10,555
It also helps, provide enough team, enough
time for teams to fix those at scale.

160
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:12,745
Third part is internal trust.

161
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:15,695
Developers have visibility
into how their systems behave.

162
00:10:16,025 --> 00:10:21,035
So it's not just the end con consumer,
but internally developers are confident

163
00:10:21,035 --> 00:10:25,235
of where and what is happening with a
certain kind of data, with observability.

164
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:27,095
And then the last part is safer.

165
00:10:27,095 --> 00:10:31,445
ML only compliant data reaches
downstream models, reducing the risk

166
00:10:31,445 --> 00:10:33,395
of training or unauthorized input.

167
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:38,900
In short, observability reduces both
legal and operational risk while

168
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,400
improving the system hygiene incredibly.

169
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,760
Coming to what the future looks like
in this domain there are still a lot

170
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,250
of exciting open areas of research
in privacy aware infrastructure.

171
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:56,410
Looking specifically from the lens
of observability, we can, let's say,

172
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,860
use machine learning models to detect
privacy anomalies in real time.

173
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:04,855
And to be, to enable real
time observability while these

174
00:11:04,855 --> 00:11:06,115
models are being trained.

175
00:11:06,115 --> 00:11:11,505
The inferred data is a big challenge in
itself to be able to observe systems.

176
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:15,225
Become policy enforcement
systems both at the same time.

177
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,045
That's again, a big area of research.

178
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:23,655
The third part could be should we
standardize policy observability like we

179
00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:25,995
did with open telemetry for system traces.

180
00:11:26,505 --> 00:11:29,445
There's no industry standard at
the moment, especially to handle

181
00:11:29,445 --> 00:11:34,305
this at scale and in a very
compliant and standard manner.

182
00:11:34,785 --> 00:11:38,605
This is a huge area, in my opinion,
where researchers and developers

183
00:11:38,605 --> 00:11:40,405
could invest heavily with.

184
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:46,660
The goal is to move from the fact
of inspection to real time Automatic

185
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:52,545
enforcement in a privacy control plane
and observability helps move there faster.

186
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:58,905
In conclusion observability in
privacy infra is not optional anymore.

187
00:11:59,325 --> 00:12:01,635
If you can't see it, you can't enforce it.

188
00:12:01,965 --> 00:12:04,385
That's the that's my takeaway from.

189
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:09,965
My experience working in this domain
as systems scale only observable

190
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:14,225
systems can remain compliant, ethical,
and trustworthy at the same time.

191
00:12:14,585 --> 00:12:17,375
And the investments we make
today are what will power

192
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,875
responsible innovation tomorrow.

193
00:12:19,745 --> 00:12:20,175
Thank you.
