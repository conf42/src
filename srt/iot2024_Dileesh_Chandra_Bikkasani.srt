00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,940
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,910
Welcome to Con 42 Internet
of Things IoT 2024.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:11,469
My name is Dilshan Rabbi Kasani and
welcome to my session on digital twins.

4
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:17,690
So the session I'll be covering today
is about the transformative role of

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:22,690
digital twins for network resiliency
and fault tolerance in IoT systems.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:29,420
As IoT systems grow and evolve,
the increasing complexity of

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,770
managing the networks for those
systems increases as well.

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,530
digital twins can offer solutions.

9
00:00:36,235 --> 00:00:37,265
for these problems.

10
00:00:37,475 --> 00:00:38,805
So let's dive right in.

11
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:44,035
today I plan to cover, give a brief
introduction about what digital

12
00:00:44,065 --> 00:00:49,704
twins are, what is network resiliency
and what is fault tolerance and

13
00:00:49,714 --> 00:00:53,254
why these are important and how
digital twins can enhance them.

14
00:00:53,794 --> 00:00:58,254
I'll touch up briefly on what
digital twins are, and the role

15
00:00:58,254 --> 00:01:01,995
of digital twins in this, network
resiliency and fault tolerance.

16
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:08,735
I'll also provide some use cases, in
IOT systems and advantages of using

17
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:13,365
digital twins and, implementation
challenges of digital twins as well.

18
00:01:13,965 --> 00:01:19,235
and I'll conclude with future directions
and what to use within digital twins.

19
00:01:19,655 --> 00:01:22,195
So let's get started.

20
00:01:22,935 --> 00:01:28,355
so we are currently living in an age of
smart, meaning that every system around

21
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:30,925
us, we prefer to have it as smart system.

22
00:01:31,455 --> 00:01:38,495
Either it's smartwatch or smart car
or smart city or whatever, right?

23
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:43,895
as we go towards the smart approach
and smart mindset, there are many

24
00:01:43,935 --> 00:01:46,255
complex IOT systems that are involved.

25
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:52,920
which need to be always interconnected
with each other and transfer

26
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,590
data to the appropriate systems.

27
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:02,780
So to support these systems, what we need
to do is to simulate and troubleshoot

28
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,469
any issues with the IOT systems, right?

29
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,860
So coming to the IOT architecture.

30
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:13,790
So you'll have your usual sensors,
actuators, and smart devices, which

31
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,540
are transmitting always the accurate
amount of data that it's required

32
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,440
to digitally simulate, systems.

33
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:27,810
So you have, you'll have your gateways
and you'll collect all this data and

34
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,950
store it in a data lake somewhere.

35
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,780
And once you have all this
is a traditional approach in

36
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,890
machine learning too, right?

37
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,450
Where you'll get your data, you'll clean
it and you'll put it in a data warehouse.

38
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,670
And then perform some kind of machine
learning or, build some models

39
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,110
around that, predicting failures or,
predicting any issues with the systems.

40
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,280
So, you'll have your control
applications, your models, your

41
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,060
machine learning, your data analytics.

42
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,830
And, at the end of the day,
What you really need is

43
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,370
everything working together.

44
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,490
so coming to network resiliency.

45
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,890
So what basically network resiliency
means is, the ability of the network

46
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,540
to withstand and recover, quickly
from disruptions and failures.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,170
So in case of a network disruption
or a failure, the network

48
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,720
needs to come back up, right?

49
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:17,760
Okay.

50
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,040
When you have smartwatch a
smartphone, you know how it feels

51
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,730
when, it goes out of network, right?

52
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,710
So you always need that quick, turnaround
of connecting back to the network.

53
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,840
And, in case of any failures you
need, for it to connect back, as well.

54
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,860
and the capacity of the network,
you need the network to come back

55
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,460
up fastly and adapt and continue.

56
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,390
So not just.

57
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,430
Basically, the same thing
happening twice, right?

58
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:51,510
So you'll want the system to learn
basically what happened by simulating

59
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:57,900
it in the backend, either through some
data lake or some machine learning model.

60
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,870
So you'll need this
information in the backend.

61
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,560
So network resiliency, meaning that,
the network needs to withstand and

62
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,480
recover quickly from the disruptions.

63
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,360
So importance of network resilience.

64
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,110
you need to minimize the downtime.

65
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,170
So we all face downtimes.

66
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:23,600
But, what, the companies need to do
or what the systems need to be in a

67
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,150
shape where it reduces the downtime.

68
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,520
So you want as much downtime,
as minimal downtime as possible.

69
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,060
So you need to reduce the
service, interruptions.

70
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,050
and you need to ensure the
operations are continuous.

71
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,980
you need to protect the
data as well, right?

72
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,520
So once your network is down or
some system is done, there'll be a

73
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,410
multitude of, vulnerabilities that you
will be exposed to, which you need to

74
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,880
quickly, recover, or you'll be subject
to information loss or corruption,

75
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,160
during the outages, data corruption.

76
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,050
So you need to maintain
the productivity as well.

77
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,950
So even though you.

78
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,760
users lose some kind of network,
access, you still want them to

79
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,210
perform some kind of things, right?

80
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:13,170
And all of this, the things that I talk
about in terms of, a digital connectivity.

81
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,000
So this is a basic digital connectivity
that everyone needs to have.

82
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,530
And I'll discuss later about how
digital twins can enhance this.

83
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,740
So enhance customer satisfaction.

84
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,570
So customers need to have the
uninterrupted service, and

85
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,860
increased customer satisfaction
or you lose customers, right?

86
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,590
And fault tolerance.

87
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,030
So this is similar to, network
resilience, but what fault tolerance

88
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,420
is, even if a part of the system
fails, rest of the system can

89
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,010
function, as smoothly as possible.

90
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,825
So some parts of the system
fail and everything goes on.

91
00:05:46,835 --> 00:05:48,455
That's not a good experience, right?

92
00:05:48,745 --> 00:05:52,595
So you want to minimize the
downtime of, applications as well.

93
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:54,695
you want to improve the reliability.

94
00:05:54,695 --> 00:05:57,385
So the systems need to be more dependable.

95
00:05:57,845 --> 00:06:05,045
and it's not very easy for IOT systems
to be, simulated because the complexity

96
00:06:05,105 --> 00:06:12,090
of, so let's say if you have, a hundred
thousand or some big amount of a number

97
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,660
of IOT system connected together.

98
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,370
It's hard to simulate all the
systems where failure, happens.

99
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,600
So that's where digital trends can help.

100
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,680
protect protecting, data.

101
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:27,450
during failures, you want to have a
backup mechanism and, Some kind of

102
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:31,380
mechanism where data corruption doesn't
happen and, failure doesn't happen.

103
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,970
So role of fault tolerance,
in minimizing disruption.

104
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,230
continued operation.

105
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,980
So you have to enable systems to
function when, some components

106
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,570
fail and, prevent complete outages.

107
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,930
So where you can't even access the system.

108
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,110
you want to reduce the downtime.

109
00:06:48,585 --> 00:06:52,075
So all of the service interruptions
that happen, you want to reduce that.

110
00:06:52,105 --> 00:06:58,365
So this is similar to network resiliency,
where, in fault tolerance, what we talk

111
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:05,385
about is it's, it's a system's capability
of coming up, even when a component fails.

112
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:10,695
Right and Reliability, so Overall
reliability and dependability of

113
00:07:10,735 --> 00:07:15,905
the systems are also important and
protecting the Critical information of

114
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:20,995
the customers when our failures happen
and enhancing the customer experience

115
00:07:21,695 --> 00:07:26,465
This is what the fault tolerance Role
is in minimizing the disruptions.

116
00:07:26,555 --> 00:07:30,825
So coming to the actual core
of the topic Digital twins.

117
00:07:30,835 --> 00:07:32,975
So what are digital twins?

118
00:07:33,735 --> 00:07:39,335
So digital twins are nothing but a virtual
replica of the actual physical system.

119
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:44,365
So you have your physical system, let's
say that a manufacturing system or a

120
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:47,825
component or a service or anything, right?

121
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:52,665
So you have all of the data of the
physical system where you can build

122
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:59,305
a virtual replica of it in the
cloud or on prem where it digitally.

123
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:03,225
So it's a digital representation
of a physical object.

124
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:08,425
so the, thing with the digital
twin is you need real time data.

125
00:08:08,715 --> 00:08:13,445
So continuously, you need to
update the physical, digital system

126
00:08:13,795 --> 00:08:15,435
with the physical systems data.

127
00:08:15,825 --> 00:08:19,005
So all of the data that you have
in the physical system, you'll

128
00:08:19,085 --> 00:08:21,145
store it, in near real time.

129
00:08:21,715 --> 00:08:24,145
And you'll build a digital twin.

130
00:08:24,315 --> 00:08:25,545
digital twin out of it.

131
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,275
So this can help you in
a multitude of reasons.

132
00:08:29,285 --> 00:08:31,385
So you, for any simulation, right?

133
00:08:31,705 --> 00:08:35,085
you can simulate, a failure
happening within a particular

134
00:08:35,085 --> 00:08:38,735
system, digitally without having
any impact on the physical system.

135
00:08:38,815 --> 00:08:45,145
So this way you can set up a feedback
loop where in digital systems, you can,

136
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,995
experiment with multitude of, parameters.

137
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,980
and have the changes implemented
in the physical system.

138
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:58,420
So this can help the decision making
process where you perform multiple

139
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:03,860
number of tests in the digital twin
and implement in the real system.

140
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,120
examples of the digital twins are
manufacturing equipment, where

141
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,500
you have multiple number of.

142
00:09:09,725 --> 00:09:11,255
pieces, IOT systems.

143
00:09:11,645 --> 00:09:17,265
And once you get all of the data
in a place somewhere, you can

144
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:18,925
build a digital twin out of it.

145
00:09:19,335 --> 00:09:24,435
And you can have an exact replica
of your physical system, digitally.

146
00:09:25,145 --> 00:09:30,015
So buildings, infrastructure, supply
chain, human bodies, even in healthcare

147
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:31,885
can be represented, digitally.

148
00:09:32,385 --> 00:09:38,535
So coming to the types of digital twins, a
manufacturing component or, within an IoT

149
00:09:38,535 --> 00:09:42,335
system are, a simple piece of equipment.

150
00:09:42,895 --> 00:09:44,555
You can have all this together.

151
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:45,795
in the.

152
00:09:46,395 --> 00:09:49,815
digital realm and have it as a
digital twin of your physical system.

153
00:09:50,265 --> 00:09:54,655
you can have either assets so you
can, it can be a car, an aeroplane

154
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:59,865
or, some kind of smart device where
you can have it, digitally, somewhere.

155
00:10:00,605 --> 00:10:01,465
So process.

156
00:10:01,465 --> 00:10:05,905
So even the process can be,
digital made as a digital twin.

157
00:10:06,295 --> 00:10:10,855
So for example, you have a manufacturing
process that runs somewhere, from

158
00:10:10,855 --> 00:10:14,725
point A to point B, you can take
all of the steps and all of the IOT

159
00:10:14,725 --> 00:10:18,455
systems involved in that process
and get the data out of the systems.

160
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,370
and make a digital twin out of it.

161
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,590
So you can do it for the systems
and network of systems as well.

162
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,310
So let's say you have a multiple number
of systems that are connected together.

163
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,770
anywhere you can get the data
out of the IOT system, you can

164
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,820
make a digital twin out of it.

165
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,830
So here is a digital twin life cycle.

166
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,990
So as I mentioned, data is at
the heart of the digital twin.

167
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,910
first step is to collect the data.

168
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,280
So any system you have, you'll
basically collect the data.

169
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,630
You'll save the data somewhere,
you'll transmit the data and

170
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,910
you store the data somewhere.

171
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,840
So once you have the data stored for
all of your systems that you require,

172
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,770
you'll evaluate and analyze the
data with multitude of parameters.

173
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,020
So you can simulate
the parameters as well.

174
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:11,440
So for example, if you have, a
Tesla car or, any car, you can.

175
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,840
crash it a hundred times, right?

176
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,880
So in the digital world, what you can
do is you can run a simulation that

177
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,210
you can, based on the parameters.

178
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:26,430
So what happens if I crash it in this
way and the parameter of X is something.

179
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:30,190
So you can have multiple parameters
where you can adjust these

180
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,850
parameters and test it out digitally.

181
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,640
You can evaluate.

182
00:11:34,965 --> 00:11:39,645
The simulations and based on the
simulations, what you can do is

183
00:11:39,675 --> 00:11:41,345
connect back to the physical system.

184
00:11:41,595 --> 00:11:45,445
So now, once you have the results
and you have some parameters, now

185
00:11:45,445 --> 00:11:46,785
let's say you want to make a change.

186
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:51,005
So you'll link back to
the physical system.

187
00:11:51,255 --> 00:11:53,510
So this is a continuous loop.

188
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,460
Where you're from collection
of data to updating the system.

189
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:03,650
So this feedback loop, you can automate
the feedback loop as well, where

190
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,810
you have a data linkage in between.

191
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,110
So once the data link is established
and you have all the process set up.

192
00:12:10,675 --> 00:12:17,015
Based on some parameters, you can simulate
something, and you can basically, update

193
00:12:17,015 --> 00:12:19,265
the setting back to the physical system.

194
00:12:19,765 --> 00:12:26,255
coming to the challenges in IoT networks,
as, IoT networks grow and evolve, so the

195
00:12:26,275 --> 00:12:29,499
complexity of the system evolves as well.

196
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,585
so number of interconnected devices.

197
00:12:31,795 --> 00:12:37,365
Now, everything you have, you wanted
to be connected to each other, either

198
00:12:37,475 --> 00:12:40,355
it's your phone, watch, earphones.

199
00:12:40,755 --> 00:12:44,625
and this is, this increases
with the IOT systems as well.

200
00:12:45,095 --> 00:12:48,505
So where you have multiple number of
devices that needs to stay connected

201
00:12:48,505 --> 00:12:50,175
together to perform accurately.

202
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:55,075
So as it increases, as the
number of systems increase, the,

203
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:56,745
complexity increases as well.

204
00:12:57,315 --> 00:13:00,275
And the protocols with
which they communicate with

205
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:01,475
each other differs as well.

206
00:13:01,725 --> 00:13:05,245
And the standards with which
they communicate change as well.

207
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:09,495
as these interdependencies
increase, the complexity increases.

208
00:13:09,825 --> 00:13:15,705
and all of this can be performed
within a digital world without having

209
00:13:15,715 --> 00:13:16,845
any impact on the physical world.

210
00:13:16,885 --> 00:13:21,495
that's where digital twins really
help in maintaining IoT systems.

211
00:13:21,725 --> 00:13:22,735
real time data dependency.

212
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:27,575
So some critical applications
within IoT systems require real

213
00:13:27,675 --> 00:13:29,345
time data for optimal performance.

214
00:13:29,345 --> 00:13:30,965
So that is a challenge as well.

215
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:33,725
that I'll cover in the
digital twin section as well.

216
00:13:34,405 --> 00:13:35,685
So network latency.

217
00:13:35,705 --> 00:13:40,395
So all of the systems to stay
connected together, the systems

218
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:41,935
need to be connected very fast.

219
00:13:42,205 --> 00:13:43,465
So network has to be.

220
00:13:44,085 --> 00:13:46,545
really fast and the connection
speeds has to be really fast.

221
00:13:47,055 --> 00:13:50,575
network latency is another issue as well.

222
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:55,455
So some failures, so let's say if you have
a network outage or a packet loss or high

223
00:13:55,455 --> 00:13:58,055
latency, this can disrupt the operations.

224
00:13:58,135 --> 00:14:03,325
for your systems, where you can, where
digital twins help in, simulating this.

225
00:14:03,915 --> 00:14:05,525
So security vulnerabilities.

226
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:09,325
So all of your security
devices, you can simulate it.

227
00:14:09,385 --> 00:14:11,265
let's say your firewall goes down, right?

228
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:16,740
So physically, it's really hard for you
to test that out when you have actual

229
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:23,070
users in the system, where virtually
digital twins make this easy, where you

230
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:28,770
can simulate a firewall going down and
make choices based on these parameters.

231
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,080
Scalability.

232
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:35,310
So as IOT systems grow in, scale,
scale, managing and maintaining

233
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,710
these systems increase as well.

234
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,290
and limitations to the
traditional methods.

235
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:47,530
So rather than having proactive approach,
for fault management, you can have a

236
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:53,400
simulated experience in the digital
involved and have the systems upgraded

237
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,740
automatically in a feedback loop.

238
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:01,910
and it's also difficult in predicting
and preventing complex failures.

239
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:10,320
And if you have a large IoT
ecosystem, it's hard to visualize

240
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,470
the entire system way physically.

241
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:18,670
So if you have it in digital,
it's easy to, visualize right and

242
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,200
make decisions based on those.

243
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,800
So digital twins in network
resiliency and fault tolerance.

244
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,610
How can this help?

245
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:30,300
How can digital twins help in network
resiliency and fault tolerance for

246
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,447
the limitations that we saw earlier?

247
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:37,977
You can do a proactive failure detection
so you can identify any potential

248
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:43,117
issues, either simulating a variant
error of IoT systems or network

249
00:15:43,137 --> 00:15:45,807
congestion or before they occur.

250
00:15:46,197 --> 00:15:51,077
So you can predict what's going
to happen when let's say 100, 000

251
00:15:51,077 --> 00:15:57,637
users attack your network or use
your network or use your system.

252
00:15:57,947 --> 00:16:01,542
You can simulate that and
have systems ready in place.

253
00:16:01,902 --> 00:16:03,832
and you can analyze the data patterns.

254
00:16:03,842 --> 00:16:08,332
So this is on par with the traditional
machine learning and data science

255
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:11,892
model as well, where you can use
traditional data science and machine

256
00:16:11,892 --> 00:16:16,152
learning within the digital pins and
simulate those, results and update

257
00:16:16,152 --> 00:16:17,622
the systems back, physical systems.

258
00:16:18,147 --> 00:16:24,687
So predictive maintenance, so forecasting,
equipment failures, and, you can schedule

259
00:16:24,697 --> 00:16:29,137
maintenance proactively without, having
any impact on the physical systems.

260
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:34,867
So you can, traditionally how
it's done is, you collect all the

261
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:39,147
data and you have it somewhere,
but that's just a store of data.

262
00:16:39,327 --> 00:16:41,097
and not a physical system within itself.

263
00:16:41,637 --> 00:16:45,157
So a digital, a replica of
the physical system, as such.

264
00:16:45,447 --> 00:16:49,187
But you'll have a big table of data and
you'll perform some machine learning,

265
00:16:49,187 --> 00:16:53,257
you'll predict your analytics and
whatnot and update the physical system.

266
00:16:53,757 --> 00:16:56,987
With the digital twins, what you
can do is to set up a feedback loop.

267
00:16:57,702 --> 00:17:00,912
and have that, help, with the network
resilience and fault tolerance.

268
00:17:01,092 --> 00:17:06,522
So disaster recovery, so you can,
simulate the disaster scenarios where, for

269
00:17:06,522 --> 00:17:12,742
example, a natural, calamity occurs, like
earthquakes or floods, and you can assess,

270
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:17,152
you can physically, It's physically, it's
impossible to, simulate these rights.

271
00:17:17,152 --> 00:17:20,162
You can, in the digital world,
it's easy to simulate these.

272
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:24,362
So you can simulate, what happens
when an earthquake or flood happens.

273
00:17:24,422 --> 00:17:29,392
You have various systems, all are
interconnected and assess the impact

274
00:17:29,392 --> 00:17:30,672
of the critical infrastructure.

275
00:17:31,327 --> 00:17:34,637
and use cases, coming to the use cases,
there are multiple use cases for the

276
00:17:34,647 --> 00:17:39,487
IoT systems where you can have, smart
cities, industrial IoT and healthcare IoT.

277
00:17:40,197 --> 00:17:44,697
So within the smart cities, you can
have energy grids where you can optimize

278
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:46,087
the energy distribution of the grid.

279
00:17:46,187 --> 00:17:49,887
you can predict the, blackouts
or any service interruptions.

280
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,787
and you can integrate, renewable
energy sources as well.

281
00:17:53,277 --> 00:17:56,417
So for transportation systems, you
can improve the flow of traffic.

282
00:17:56,717 --> 00:18:01,927
You can simulate based on the
physical data, physical traffic data.

283
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:07,347
You can capture all the physical data
and have it, simulate in a digital

284
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,987
environment, a digital twin of traffic.

285
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,097
So remember I mentioned you
can do a process as well.

286
00:18:13,577 --> 00:18:18,477
So all of the traffic that flows through a
certain point, you can have that process.

287
00:18:18,952 --> 00:18:23,972
As a digital twin and simulate what
happens and simulate the number of,

288
00:18:24,412 --> 00:18:26,812
accidents or, anything that can happen.

289
00:18:27,162 --> 00:18:30,172
and you can optimize the
traffic based on that.

290
00:18:30,682 --> 00:18:34,662
You can optimize the public transport
as well, where in holiday time or

291
00:18:34,662 --> 00:18:40,282
in a high flowing area, you can
predict, based on the digital twins.

292
00:18:40,592 --> 00:18:45,462
You can set up simulation scenarios and,
Prevent those, public transport issues

293
00:18:45,772 --> 00:18:47,932
and enhance the roads have safety as well.

294
00:18:48,632 --> 00:18:52,582
So coming to industrial IOT,
coming to predictive maintenance.

295
00:18:52,892 --> 00:18:57,865
So you can, predict the machinery health
or equipment failures based on all

296
00:18:57,865 --> 00:19:03,242
of the IOT systems that are connected
to, a modern machinery system, right?

297
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:07,622
equipment site so you can predict
all these equipment failures and

298
00:19:07,622 --> 00:19:09,632
schedule the maintenance a accordingly.

299
00:19:10,102 --> 00:19:15,032
so optimizing, process optimization, you
can, improve the efficiency of a process,

300
00:19:15,272 --> 00:19:18,502
reduce waste, or enhanced product quality.

301
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:21,182
You count this, you call this,
lean manufacturing, right?

302
00:19:21,182 --> 00:19:23,132
Where you have green
manufacturing, lean manufacturing.

303
00:19:23,732 --> 00:19:28,772
where you, improve efficiency, reduce
the waste that you produce, and you

304
00:19:28,772 --> 00:19:30,282
can enhance product quality as well.

305
00:19:30,952 --> 00:19:35,932
So coming to healthcare, healthcare
has some, really interesting, digital

306
00:19:36,212 --> 00:19:40,672
twin scenarios as well, where you
can monitor a patient health remotely

307
00:19:41,052 --> 00:19:47,732
by, creating a physical, a digital
replica of the patient's health.

308
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:51,842
So this helps you in early intervention.

309
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:56,687
And, if any critical life support
systems are needed or any medical devices

310
00:19:56,707 --> 00:19:58,547
are needed, this can help as well.

311
00:19:59,047 --> 00:20:02,587
So coming to the implementation
challenges, so there are, some challenges

312
00:20:02,597 --> 00:20:04,247
in implementing digital twins as well.

313
00:20:04,877 --> 00:20:08,107
so data integration and interoperability.

314
00:20:08,477 --> 00:20:12,847
So connecting data from, collecting
and integrating data from different

315
00:20:12,857 --> 00:20:14,787
sources is a challenge as well.

316
00:20:14,807 --> 00:20:19,567
So you have your thousands of hundreds
of thousands of millions of sensors.

317
00:20:19,877 --> 00:20:23,887
you'll have to collect those data and
you'll have to make sure that the network

318
00:20:23,887 --> 00:20:30,927
that the data is transported to is
seamless and store the data somewhere.

319
00:20:31,152 --> 00:20:33,722
you will have your databases,
your APIs and whatnot.

320
00:20:34,252 --> 00:20:37,662
So you have to ensure the
data consistency, accuracy

321
00:20:37,772 --> 00:20:40,292
and interoperability, across
the different systems as well.

322
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:45,772
So scalability, so scaling digital
twin models, is a challenge as well.

323
00:20:45,782 --> 00:20:50,662
handling the complexity and computational
demands of large scale IoT deployments,

324
00:20:50,992 --> 00:20:57,072
with, Increasing IOT system, it's hard
to manage it in the digital twin as well.

325
00:20:57,232 --> 00:21:00,442
forget about managing it
physically, but, digitally it's

326
00:21:00,502 --> 00:21:01,872
really hard to manage as well.

327
00:21:02,342 --> 00:21:05,502
deploying scalable for complex systems.

328
00:21:05,772 --> 00:21:10,372
So you have a million devices, and all of
those are, in the form of a digital twin.

329
00:21:10,692 --> 00:21:11,342
it's.

330
00:21:12,012 --> 00:21:16,222
It's okay to perform some kind of metrics
or, some kind of simulations based on

331
00:21:16,222 --> 00:21:22,472
that, but it's really harder to have, that
feedback loop, for millions of systems.

332
00:21:22,732 --> 00:21:27,732
So the scalability within the
digital twins is hard as well.

333
00:21:28,342 --> 00:21:30,012
So real time synchronization.

334
00:21:30,132 --> 00:21:35,807
So this is challenged with every system,
not just digital twins, but, you'll at

335
00:21:35,807 --> 00:21:37,822
least have to have a near real time.

336
00:21:38,322 --> 00:21:42,402
data ingestion loop, where you
synchronize the data between your

337
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:44,792
physical system and the digital system.

338
00:21:45,242 --> 00:21:47,912
So that is a challenge, for
the digital twins as well.

339
00:21:48,412 --> 00:21:53,742
And you have to ensure your virtual
model actually, accurately reflects the

340
00:21:53,742 --> 00:21:55,152
current state of the real world system.

341
00:21:55,612 --> 00:22:00,202
Now you have all of your million
devices or, however many systems

342
00:22:00,222 --> 00:22:02,532
you have in the digital world.

343
00:22:03,332 --> 00:22:08,432
Setting up those systems initially
will be a challenge as well, where

344
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:12,712
you need to set up the way that
it's exactly in the physical world.

345
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:14,802
So that can be a challenge as well.

346
00:22:15,182 --> 00:22:18,192
But I think to conclude this session.

347
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:23,167
let's dive into the future directions
so you can use machine learning and

348
00:22:23,197 --> 00:22:27,897
AI and integrate it into the digital
twins, and, power your decision making.

349
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:31,637
you can have digital twins that
can make autonomous decision based

350
00:22:31,637 --> 00:22:34,807
on real time data and predictions
and set up a loop for that.

351
00:22:34,827 --> 00:22:38,237
That's a loop that I talked
about where you can, simulate

352
00:22:38,397 --> 00:22:41,017
the systems and you can make it.

353
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:44,627
take some autonomous stations and
implement in the physical system.

354
00:22:45,277 --> 00:22:47,747
leverage of the 6G networks.

355
00:22:47,987 --> 00:22:52,667
So now, with the ITU, guidelines,
providing for 6G networks, the

356
00:22:52,677 --> 00:22:54,507
bandwidth and, network connectivity.

357
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:58,677
for these systems will be,
very much faster and, higher.

358
00:22:59,137 --> 00:23:05,097
So to enhance real time, data exchange,
6G can be used for digital twins as well.

359
00:23:05,327 --> 00:23:10,447
exploring, UR LLC, ultra available,
low latency communication for

360
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:14,107
mission critical systems, mission
IoT systems can be used as well.

361
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:19,917
So these are some, things that can
enhance the digital twin experience.

362
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:22,547
And cross industry applications.

363
00:23:22,857 --> 00:23:28,327
So you can have it, in multiple,
cross industries where one of the

364
00:23:28,327 --> 00:23:32,747
system that you have physically is
in one industry and the other system

365
00:23:32,747 --> 00:23:34,347
that you have is in other industry.

366
00:23:34,597 --> 00:23:39,475
So cross industry, can be, another, future
direction for digital twins as well.

367
00:23:39,475 --> 00:23:44,927
So in this talk to conclude in this
talk, we have covered a digital

368
00:23:45,197 --> 00:23:51,187
twins, how they help IOT systems, how
they help reduce network resiliency

369
00:23:51,217 --> 00:23:53,987
and fault tolerance in IOT systems.

370
00:23:54,037 --> 00:23:59,317
And how can you enhance your IOT
systems based on digital twins?

371
