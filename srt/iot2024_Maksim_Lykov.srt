But today, we are witnessing a
transformation unlike anything before.

6
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:20,409
One driven, not by
mechanical breakthrough.

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:25,470
But by the integration of cutting edge it,
this, it revolution is reshaping vehicles

8
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:28,080
into intelligent, connected ecosystems.

9
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,930
One considered a tool for transportation.

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,489
The car has now evolved into smart
companion, capable of seamless,

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,930
communication, personalization,
and even making after decision.

12
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,515
In this presentation, we'll explore
how the, automotive industry's

13
00:00:43,575 --> 00:00:47,890
adoption of it has brought us to this
point and where it's taken us next.

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,330
We'll focus on three key areas,
the rise of smart vehicles, the

15
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,860

by enabling smartphone projection
onto supported vehicle displays.

24
00:01:26,565 --> 00:01:28,005
And I'm excited to be here.

25
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:33,744
And, before we dive into the
details, let me briefly outline what

26
00:01:33,854 --> 00:01:35,134
we'll be covering in this session.

27
00:01:35,634 --> 00:01:40,154
At the heart of the automotive IT

34
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:08,999
how we interact with our vehicles.

35
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,659
Think of a car that learns your
habits, adjusts its settings to your

36
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:17,999
preferences, and in truth, you're
always updated with the latest features.

37
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:19,539
Just like your smartphone.

38
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:23,889
On the other hand, infotainment
systems have transformed cars into

39
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:26,459
hubs of connectivity and entertainment.

40
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:31,519

45
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:51,349
Balancing advanced features with
usability and ensuring distraction free

46
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:53,519
interfaces remain critical priorities.

47
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,829
And finally, we have future trends.

48
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:59,449
the promise of reshaping the
very essence of transportation.

49
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:04,249
From autonomous vehicles that can
navigate without human intervention to

50
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:08,719
blockchain powered data security, the
horizon is filled with possibilities.

51
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,169
Concepts like mobility as a service,
or shifting focus away from ownership,

52
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,199
And toward shared on demand models.

53
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:22,379
And as personalization becomes a
key driver, vehicles are expected to

54
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:27,529
become an extension of our homes and
offices, tailored uniquely to each user.

55
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:31,039
Together, these three pillars are
not just transforming the driving

56
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,539
experience, they are redefining what it
means to own and interact with a car.

57
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:40,579
As we move forward, this innovation
will control to blur the line between

58
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:43,019

59
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,194
for that.

60
00:03:43,694 --> 00:03:47,984
And to truly understand the IT revolution
in the automotive industry, we need to

61
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:50,674
take a step back and explore its roots.

62
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:54,214
The integration of IT into
cars didn't happen overnight.

63
00:03:54,504 --> 00:03:58,994
It was a gradual journey, one marked
by key milestones, that laid the

64
00:03:58,994 --> 00:04:00,554
foundation for today's achievement.

65
00:04:01,054 --> 00:04:05,764
And the earliest signs of IT adoption
in vehicles can be traced back to

66
00:04:06,244 --> 00:04:12,064
1980s, when electronic control units,
or ECUs, began to appear in cars.

67
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:15,914
These small computers were initially
introduced to improve engine performance

68
00:04:15,954 --> 00:04:19,884

76
00:04:45,264 --> 00:04:46,404
systems began to surface.

77
00:04:46,904 --> 00:04:50,804
what started as a simple radio and
cassette players, eventually evolved into

78
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:53,574
CD changers and basic navigation systems.

79
00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:59,614
Through primitive by today's standards,
these features hinted at a future

80
00:04:59,644 --> 00:05:03,444
where cars would serve as more
than just a mode of transportation.

81
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:06,974

usability, but also set a new standard

169
00:10:42,134 --> 00:10:46,544
for infotainment systems, shaping
consumer expectations and encouraging

170
00:10:46,874 --> 00:10:48,574
further innovation in its space.

171
00:10:49,074 --> 00:10:52,194
As infotainment system evolved,
AI integration became a

172
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:53,844
major driver for innovation.

173
00:10:54,304 --> 00:10:58,124
In Car AI now powers features like
voice recognition, personalized

174
00:10:58,154 --> 00:11:00,194
recommendation, and predictive navigation.

175
00:11:00,574 --> 00:11:05,124
For instance, AI driven voice assistants,
such as Apple Siri, Google Assistant,

176
00:11:05,444 --> 00:11:09,284
allow drivers to control their car
functions hands free, making the

177
00:11:09,284 --> 00:11:11,544
experience safer and more intuitive.

178
00:11:12,534 --> 00:11:16,294
However, with all the benefits
AI offers, there are significant

179
00:11:16,294 --> 00:11:17,524
user experience challenges.

180
00:11:17,904 --> 00:11:22,124
Infotainment systems have become more
complex, and the balance between providing

181
00:11:22,124 --> 00:11:26,074
powerful features and maintaining
ease of use is difficult to achieve.

182
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:30,724
Drivers can easily become overwhelmed
by too many options, while reliance

183
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:33,624
on voice commands and touchscreen
can lead to distractions.

184
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:39,449
Ensuring that AI adds real value without
complicating the driver experience

185
00:11:39,619 --> 00:11:42,389
remains a key hurdle for automakers.

186
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:46,699
The future of in car AI will
depend on creative, intuitive,

187
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:50,959
user friendly interfaces that
enhance safety and convenience

188
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:53,009
without overwhelming the driver.

189
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:57,049
And now let's move and talk a
bit about autonomous driving.

190
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:02,459
Currently, IT and AI are at the core
of the push toward autonomous driving.

191
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:07,409
Automation in vehicles is categorized
into five levels, from level one,

192
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:11,789
which involves basic driver assistance,
to level five, where the car drives

193
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:13,799
itself without any human interaction.

194
00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:20,064
At each level, the role of IT becomes more
crucial, As vehicles rely increasingly

195
00:12:20,284 --> 00:12:25,294
on AI driven systems for decision making
and control, AI driven systems and

196
00:12:25,484 --> 00:12:30,344
autonomous vehicles rely on a combination
of sensors, radar, cameras, and machine

197
00:12:30,344 --> 00:12:35,694
learning to process vast amounts of
data and make split second decisions.

198
00:12:36,374 --> 00:12:40,744
These systems need to understand and
predict the behavior of other vehicles,

199
00:12:40,924 --> 00:12:42,584
pedestrians, and the environment.

200
00:12:42,584 --> 00:12:45,994
SAT and AI technologies
continue to evolve.

201
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:50,084
We are getting closer to achieving fully
autonomous vehicles, but challenges

202
00:12:50,254 --> 00:12:54,624
such as regulatory approval, safety,
and technology reliability remain.

203
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:59,744
And while the dream of fully autonomous
vehicles and tantalizing significant

204
00:12:59,744 --> 00:13:04,464
limitations and challenges remain,
before we can see wide scale deployment.

205
00:13:05,274 --> 00:13:08,114
One of the biggest obstacles in
the technology is reliability.

206
00:13:08,614 --> 00:13:12,784
Even the most advanced AI systems
struggle to handle the complex

207
00:13:12,814 --> 00:13:14,774
dynamic environments on the road.

208
00:13:15,174 --> 00:13:16,154
For instance, Weimar.

209
00:13:16,674 --> 00:13:20,474
A leader in autonomous driving
technology has made significant strides

210
00:13:20,724 --> 00:13:25,484
with its self driving cars, but their
vehicles are still not universally

211
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,784
ready for all road conditions.

212
00:13:28,204 --> 00:13:32,814
In fact, Weimar's cars can only operate
autonomously in certain cities where

213
00:13:32,814 --> 00:13:34,734
the environment is highly controlled.

214
00:13:35,409 --> 00:13:38,809
Another major challenge
is regulatory approval.

215
00:13:39,349 --> 00:13:43,659
Countries and regions are moving at
different speeds when it comes to setting

216
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:45,569
legal frameworks for autonomous vehicles.

217
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:49,839
For example, Tesla has faced legal
scrutiny over its autopilot system,

218
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:55,619
with critics pointing to incidents where
the system failed to detect obstacles.

219
00:13:56,114 --> 00:13:57,724
and acted unpredictably.

220
00:13:58,244 --> 00:14:01,554
As a result, Tesla continues to
face challenges in convincing

221
00:14:01,644 --> 00:14:05,354
regulators and consumers that
fully autonomous driving is safe.

222
00:14:06,094 --> 00:14:08,434
Safety concerns also remain.

223
00:14:08,934 --> 00:14:09,754
at the forefront.

224
00:14:10,244 --> 00:14:15,694
In 2021, an accident involving a
cruise autonomous vehicle owned by

225
00:14:15,714 --> 00:14:19,414
General Motors might headlines when
it crashed during a test drive.

226
00:14:20,054 --> 00:14:24,244
This incident highlighted the
difficulty of ensuring that autonomous

227
00:14:24,244 --> 00:14:28,184
vehicles can make real time decisions
in unpredictable situations.

228
00:14:28,794 --> 00:14:31,424
Finally, there is the
issue of public trust.

229
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:36,849
Many consumers remain skeptical about
handing full control over to a machine.

230
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:40,559
This trust gap is evident in the market.

231
00:14:40,869 --> 00:14:44,519
Through the technologies advancing,
the public is not yet fully comfortable

232
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:49,409
with the idea of vehicles driving
themselves in everyday scenarios.

233
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:54,379
The road to full autonomous driving
is still long, and this limitation

234
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:56,589
reflects the complexity of the challenge.

235
00:14:57,049 --> 00:14:57,909
Part progress.

236
00:14:58,184 --> 00:15:01,864
It's undeniable, achieving a future
where autonomous vehicles are a

237
00:15:01,864 --> 00:15:06,314
common sight on roads worldwide will
require overcoming these technical,

238
00:15:06,374 --> 00:15:08,314
legal, and societal hurdles.

239
00:15:09,294 --> 00:15:12,914
And automation is not only,
relates to the vehicle itself.

240
00:15:13,634 --> 00:15:18,154
for example, think about Tesla,
they serve as a prime example of

241
00:15:18,164 --> 00:15:20,164
robotics and automation in action.

242
00:15:20,674 --> 00:15:24,914
These robotics are like the Tesla
bot performing a complex task such as

243
00:15:24,914 --> 00:15:26,914
battery assembly and vehicle painting.

244
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,634
Tesla had reduced production
time and cost while maintaining

245
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,284
high standards of precision.

246
00:15:32,554 --> 00:15:36,814
This advanced integration of top
automation is key to the scalability and

247
00:15:36,814 --> 00:15:39,634
success of the electric vehicles lineup.

248
00:15:40,134 --> 00:15:45,054
And let's talk a bit about Mar
mobility service is izing the way

249
00:15:45,054 --> 00:15:49,014
people think about transportability
and set up own in a car.

250
00:15:49,104 --> 00:15:53,424
Consumer can now access a variety of
vehicles through a single platform,

251
00:15:53,634 --> 00:15:57,474
allowing for more flexible and
on demand transportation options.

252
00:15:58,214 --> 00:16:01,904
At the heart of this shift is IT,
which enables ride sharing services

253
00:16:01,934 --> 00:16:06,644
like Uber or Lyft, as well as car
subscription models offered by

254
00:16:06,644 --> 00:16:08,494
vehicles like Volvo and Porsche.

255
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:12,684
Ride sharing has become a global
phenomenon, powered by mobile

256
00:16:12,954 --> 00:16:17,074
apps that connect riders with
nearby drivers in real time.

257
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:23,424
IT platforms track vehicles, handle
payments, and optimize roads, all

258
00:16:23,434 --> 00:16:24,744
while providing data analytics.

259
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:26,809
to improve the service.

260
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:32,669
This model has reduced car ownership
costs and eased traffic congestion in

261
00:16:32,739 --> 00:16:37,979
urban areas, while also offering consumers
greater flexibility and convenience.

262
00:16:38,549 --> 00:16:41,979
Car subscription services
take Mars one step further,

263
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:43,069
offering access to the world.

264
00:16:43,554 --> 00:16:46,474
to a fleet of cars for
a fixed monthly fee.

265
00:16:46,864 --> 00:16:50,124
This model combines the benefits
of car ownership with the

266
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,204
flexibility of short term rentals.

267
00:16:52,484 --> 00:16:55,874
For instance, Porsche's subscription
program lets customers switch

268
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:59,564
between different models based on
their needs, whether it's a sport

269
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:02,639
car for the weekend or a more
practical vehicle during the week.

270
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:08,089
SIT continues to improve, Mars is expected
to expand, with more integrated platforms

271
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,329
combining ride sharing, public transport,
bike rentals, and other mobility services

272
00:17:13,509 --> 00:17:15,649
into a single user friendly ecosystem.

273
00:17:16,129 --> 00:17:20,409
This will further reduce the need
for personal car ownership and lead

274
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,394
to more sustainable and efficient
urban transportation solutions.

275
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:29,124
The rise of mobility as a service
is having a profound impact

276
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,714
on traditional car ownership.

277
00:17:31,194 --> 00:17:34,914
As small consumers turn to ride
sharing and car subscription

278
00:17:34,914 --> 00:17:36,654
models they need to own.

279
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:39,024
A personal vehicle is stately decreasing.

280
00:17:39,114 --> 00:17:43,794
Especially in urban environments, one
of the most significant changes is the

281
00:17:43,794 --> 00:17:46,434
shift in consumer behavior With masks.

282
00:17:47,034 --> 00:17:51,414
People now have the option to access
a variety of vehicle on demand.

283
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:55,359
without the financial and
maintenance burdens of ownership.

284
00:17:55,359 --> 00:18:02,179
Services like Uber and Lyft allow users
to have a ride whenever needed, while cars

285
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:06,799
go through some programs of flexibility
to switch car between, cars as desired.

286
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:10,079
This is especially appealing
to younger generation who may

287
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:13,839
prioritize experience over long
communication, like car ownership.

288
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,919
From an economic standard, standpoint,
MAS presents a compelling alternative to

289
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:25,229
owning a car, especially when considering
the total cost of ownership, insurance,

290
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:27,779
maintenance, fuel, and lubrication.

291
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:32,309
As MAS platform became more
widespread, owning a vehicle may

292
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:36,269
start to seem inefficient and
unnecessary, particularly for city

293
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:40,399
dwellers, where parking and traffic
congestion add to their inconvenience.

294
00:18:40,534 --> 00:18:44,374
For automakers, the shift toward
mass also poses a challenge.

295
00:18:44,704 --> 00:18:48,824
Companies are now pivoting from
focusing on selling cars to

296
00:18:48,824 --> 00:18:50,374
creating services and platforms.

297
00:18:50,594 --> 00:18:55,054
Arms like BMW and Ford are already
exploring mass, launching their own

298
00:18:55,074 --> 00:18:59,384
ride sharing services and investing
in electronic and autonomous fleets

299
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,494
to adapt to this challenged landscape.

300
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:05,969
Ultimately, mass is reshaping
the future of transportation.

301
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:10,389
Traditional car ownership may not
disappear entirely, but it's clear

302
00:19:10,469 --> 00:19:15,129
that mass is often a viable, flexible,
and cost effective alternative,

303
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:19,699
particularly for those who no longer
see owning a car as a necessity.

304
00:19:20,199 --> 00:19:24,829
And as the automotive industry
becomes more connected and reliant

305
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:29,369
on IT, it faces growing challenges
in cybersecurity and privacy.

306
00:19:29,939 --> 00:19:34,279
These issues are becoming increasingly
complex as vehicles incorporate

307
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:38,919
more digital technologies like IoT
sensors, cloud based services, and AI.

308
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:44,879
Cyber security is a critical concern, as
cars are now vulnerable to cyber attacks.

309
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:48,869
Hackers can potentially gain
access to vehicle control systems,

310
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:50,769
putting passengers at risk.

311
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:56,109
Higher profile attacks, such as the
2015 hack of Jeep Cherokee, where

312
00:19:56,139 --> 00:19:59,269
hackers remotely took control of
the vehicle, highlighted the risks.

313
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:03,739
With autonomous driving and V2X
communication becoming more prevalent,

314
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:08,589
the threat landscape will only expand,
requiring automakers to invest heavily

315
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:10,639
in robust cybersecurity measures.

316
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:14,989
The opportunity here lies in
developing advanced security protocols

317
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:19,389
and technologies that can ensure
vehicles are safe from cyber threats

318
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:21,319
while maintaining connectivity.

319
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:26,104
Privacy is another pressing issue,
as vehicles Transcripts collect vast

320
00:20:26,104 --> 00:20:30,144
amount of data about drivers, their
habits and their locations, such as

321
00:20:30,144 --> 00:20:34,654
DPR and other privacy regulations
commonly interplayed when factories

322
00:20:35,044 --> 00:20:37,194
must be transparent about data usage.

323
00:20:38,064 --> 00:20:41,914
into that they are storing and
handing customer information securely.

324
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,824
This is both a challenge
and an opportunity.

325
00:20:45,154 --> 00:20:48,744
Companies that can navigate
these regulations effectively

326
00:20:48,994 --> 00:20:52,374
and build trust with consumers
will have a competitive edge.

327
00:20:52,854 --> 00:20:57,624
And finally, the high cost of innovation
presents a challenge for the industry.

328
00:20:58,024 --> 00:21:01,674
Developing advanced technologies
like autonomous driving, electric

329
00:21:01,674 --> 00:21:05,374
vehicles, and connected system
requires significant investment in

330
00:21:05,374 --> 00:21:07,704
research, development, and testing.

331
00:21:08,204 --> 00:21:12,074
Aftermakers are facing pressure
to innovate while balancing

332
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,224
this high cost profitability.

333
00:21:14,424 --> 00:21:16,834
However, the opportunity here is clear.

334
00:21:17,144 --> 00:21:22,234
Companies that lead in innovation, whether
through strategic partnership, tech

335
00:21:22,294 --> 00:21:27,009
investment, or new business models, can
