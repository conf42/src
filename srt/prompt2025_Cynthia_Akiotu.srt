1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:07,680
Cyber defense used to be written
in codes, playbooks, policies.

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:13,220
Now it is written or spoken in prompts.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,640
A sentence can now accelerate a threat.

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:22,530
Configure a policy, configure
policies, and even expose secrets.

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:29,600
What an honor to be here at the
Prompt Engineering 2025 conference.

6
00:00:30,409 --> 00:00:36,200
My name is Cynthia Kyo to a cybersecurity
architect with years of experience in

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,030
managing identity and assess management.

8
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,875
As data security.

9
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:50,704
Today I'm going to be discussing about how
security co-pilot reinvent cyber defense

10
00:00:51,204 --> 00:00:56,204
using prompts from prompts to protection.

11
00:00:56,704 --> 00:00:59,154
Let's face reality with the.

12
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:01,419
Evolving landscape.

13
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:10,129
We have about 7,000 password
attacks per second, not minutes.

14
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:14,049
This is like having 7,000 doors open.

15
00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:18,969
Ling, while you are still thinking
about how to close the last one.

16
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:25,799
83% of organizations, we have more
than one breach in their lifetime.

17
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:36,720
This is not a scare or a threat, and this
is not a probability of if it's when and

18
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,060
how often this breach is going to happen.

19
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:46,749
80% of executives are living in
fair due to AI leaked risk Employees

20
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:54,399
partners are now putting prompts,
inputting sensitive information into ai.

21
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,929
This is a big challenge and I like
to call it the pressure cooker.

22
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:07,279
We are currently facing the pressure that
organizations are facing, the pressure as

23
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:12,499
an enterprise that we are facing, and the
pressure as security analysts and security

24
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,229
defenders that we are facing present.

25
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:21,484
It's becoming very overwhelming
for defenders, for analysts.

26
00:02:21,984 --> 00:02:29,435
AI is moving at the speed of light, so
also attackers are making use of ai.

27
00:02:29,935 --> 00:02:31,555
AI can now draft.

28
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:38,095
Phishing male emails even better
than humans, difficult to track.

29
00:02:38,595 --> 00:02:45,235
Analysts are drowned, are flooded
with alerts, both false positive, both

30
00:02:45,385 --> 00:02:48,434
those that are critical with fatigue.

31
00:02:48,934 --> 00:02:53,494
Even the best team cannot
manage the flood of alerts.

32
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:58,954
Or manage or check security
loopholes within the organization.

33
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:05,094
The issue or the challenge is in that
security professionals are not skilled

34
00:03:05,594 --> 00:03:12,904
or the threat landscape and attackers
are now moving at the speed of light.

35
00:03:13,404 --> 00:03:14,694
It becomes difficult.

36
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,844
Analysts to follow through.

37
00:03:17,624 --> 00:03:28,274
Because this era requires managing a lot
and managing context, defenders need to

38
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:35,629
operationalize ai Since attackers are
now weaponizing artificial intelligence.

39
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:41,079
I said earlier that those that the
previous slide shows the pressure

40
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:46,409
organizations are facing, this is
showing the current pain point of

41
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:49,609
security professionals facing this.

42
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:56,059
It requires analysts to be able to
manage the security landscape at

43
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:59,569
scale and also at machine speed.

44
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:05,999
To be able to combat the speed
in which attackers are exploiting

45
00:04:06,499 --> 00:04:10,969
loopholes in our organization with
the use of artificial intelligence.

46
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:20,589
Since ai, the same force that can be
used to weaponize, our organization can

47
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:23,259
also be used to amplify our organization.

48
00:04:23,694 --> 00:04:25,914
To manage our security posture.

49
00:04:26,414 --> 00:04:32,074
As a Microsoft certified Information
Security administrator, I make use

50
00:04:32,074 --> 00:04:37,444
of Microsoft security copilot, and
I taught it to share, use it as a

51
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:43,624
case study to see how AI can become
our teammate and a force multiplier

52
00:04:44,124 --> 00:04:46,074
with artificial intelligence.

53
00:04:46,574 --> 00:04:53,364
Prompts can now be turned to policies,
some risk to strategies, and even

54
00:04:53,754 --> 00:04:57,804
recommendation and response to resolution.

55
00:04:58,304 --> 00:05:03,619
Imagine the frustration that analysts
are facing with the landscape changing.

56
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:06,769
Attackers becoming so fast.

57
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:11,999
Leveraging artificial intelligence
to exploit our organization, it now

58
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:18,539
becomes very important and critical
for security analysts, security

59
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:24,449
professionals, to leverage the use
of artificial intelligence as a

60
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,659
force multiplier in our organization.

61
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:32,059
Instead of checking or
searching for alerts manually.

62
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:38,259
With the use of artificial intelligence
and leveraging prompts, a security analyst

63
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:44,019
can decide to type in natural language
to assess the security posterior office

64
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:50,179
organization, or the environment like
asking what, who are the most suspicious

65
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:52,969
or high risk users in the organization.

66
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:56,559
This now becomes a way to manage gaps.

67
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:58,529
This is not automation.

68
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:00,599
I call it argumentation.

69
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:06,589
Helping security professionals to
leverage artificial intelligence

70
00:06:07,429 --> 00:06:12,679
in order to be able to manage our
landscape at machine speed and at scale,

71
00:06:13,179 --> 00:06:20,084
leveraging the use of intelligence
in a smarter way because attackers.

72
00:06:20,584 --> 00:06:28,114
Weaponizing using artificial intelligence
and defenders, we need to operationalize

73
00:06:28,114 --> 00:06:31,324
as well using artificial intelligence.

74
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:37,959
This requires us to be able to
understand context, to be proactive

75
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:41,864
and to utilize intelligence market.

76
00:06:42,364 --> 00:06:47,794
With Microsoft Security copilot, you
can integrate it across your endpoint

77
00:06:47,794 --> 00:06:55,374
from Defender Purview, Microsoft into
a lot more to assess your identity and

78
00:06:55,374 --> 00:07:01,434
assess management, to assess your data
posture, to assess weak points and

79
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:03,984
vulnerability within your ecosystem.

80
00:07:04,484 --> 00:07:04,964
Then.

81
00:07:05,464 --> 00:07:11,574
One of the silent, I call it the
silent and most dangerous drifts.

82
00:07:12,074 --> 00:07:18,424
All loopholes that organizations
have is conditional assets drifts.

83
00:07:18,924 --> 00:07:24,004
Imagine you are in a large
enterprise, users are onboarded.

84
00:07:24,504 --> 00:07:30,344
They change rules and sometimes even
exit the organizations users in the

85
00:07:30,344 --> 00:07:36,584
course of changing rules are acquiring
different rights, admin rights.

86
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:41,564
What about application drift in
your organization where you have

87
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:46,514
applications deployed into the
organization and they are not covered

88
00:07:46,784 --> 00:07:49,604
with conditional access policies All.

89
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:57,174
We have redundant policies, duplicate
policies, all these are quiet ways

90
00:07:57,684 --> 00:08:03,944
in which attackers can leverage these
loopholes to assess our organization.

91
00:08:04,444 --> 00:08:08,524
When users are not covered
with proper policies like multi

92
00:08:08,524 --> 00:08:12,624
default authentication, attackers
can easily compromise those.

93
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:17,289
The identity of those users
to assess our environment.

94
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:21,409
What's about having different
policies that are obsolete, duplicate

95
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:23,509
policies, conflicting policies.

96
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:26,859
It becomes very difficult
and messy to manage.

97
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:32,019
And as a security analyst and
professional, I can tell you that it.

98
00:08:32,624 --> 00:08:39,454
It is also very difficult for the human
eye to detect such loopholes, and that

99
00:08:39,454 --> 00:08:47,194
is why Conditional Access Optimization
agents basically manages these drifts.

100
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:52,654
User drifts, application drifts
and manages policies to ensure that

101
00:08:52,654 --> 00:08:54,604
these policies are consolidated.

102
00:08:55,354 --> 00:08:59,494
And all this do not create
loopholes and vulnerability.

103
00:09:00,154 --> 00:09:07,544
Within our organization, it creates
that awareness, that context, to

104
00:09:07,544 --> 00:09:16,064
understand the ecosystem, to see gaps
immediately and respond to it before

105
00:09:16,214 --> 00:09:23,854
it becomes a breach or an access
point for attackers to leverage now.

106
00:09:24,354 --> 00:09:29,564
Let's go straight to the demo
to see how conditional access

107
00:09:29,564 --> 00:09:32,624
optimization agent works.

108
00:09:33,124 --> 00:09:36,854
Right now I'm going to show basically.

109
00:09:37,354 --> 00:09:41,074
The use of conditional
access optimization agent.

110
00:09:41,644 --> 00:09:48,574
I'm in the Microsoft intra tenant, and
here you can see users at high risk.

111
00:09:49,264 --> 00:09:53,794
In my tenant, I have 54 user
detection with high risk level.

112
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:57,204
So now I'm going to go straight to agents.

113
00:09:57,474 --> 00:09:59,184
I click on this, go to agents.

114
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:05,319
It takes me straight to the conditional
access optimization agent where I can

115
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:11,009
check for user drift to see users that
are not covered by conditional access

116
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:17,009
policies, like multi authentication to see
applications deployed in the organization

117
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:21,449
that are not covered with this proper
policies and even check for policy Mer.

118
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:22,334
So here.

119
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:28,624
With conditional access optimization,
it shows me the performance highlights.

120
00:10:29,434 --> 00:10:35,344
Right here I can see I have one
20 unprotected users discovered.

121
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:36,744
This is AI.

122
00:10:36,744 --> 00:10:37,434
At work,

123
00:10:37,934 --> 00:10:42,584
I can also see activities that have
been carrying out by the agent.

124
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:48,714
Extent of the where you see a security
analyst drowned with a lot, drowned with

125
00:10:48,744 --> 00:10:55,434
managing floods of configuration and
policy with the agent on guard 24 hours.

126
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:59,864
The security analyst can
also take a break as well.

127
00:11:00,614 --> 00:11:06,074
So here I can view the
activities of the agents.

128
00:11:06,574 --> 00:11:09,689
So basically this shows me
the activity of the agents.

129
00:11:10,189 --> 00:11:14,599
From seeing what it did from the
conditional access optimization engine,

130
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:23,869
seeing the policy user drift, you can see
it scanned users within the last 24 hours.

131
00:11:23,989 --> 00:11:29,649
You can see these activities, so
let's go straight into subjections.

132
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:32,139
That is where I like to show more.

133
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,299
These suggestions basically
scans your environment.

134
00:11:36,944 --> 00:11:44,474
And tells you where there are gaps, and
also give you recommendations on how you

135
00:11:44,474 --> 00:11:48,364
can apply policies to cover these gaps.

136
00:11:48,864 --> 00:11:53,664
So now I have here there's a
recommendation or a subjection saying

137
00:11:54,444 --> 00:12:00,264
how two users to existing policy
require MFA for financial apps.

138
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:05,019
For high, medium, and
low risk signing user.

139
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:10,749
So there is a financial application
used in the organization and before

140
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:14,149
users should assess that application.

141
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:20,779
The condition access optimization is
suggesting that two users currently have

142
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:24,229
not been added to those PO to that policy.

143
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:25,909
So that is a gap.

144
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:29,539
So with this, I can now
apply the subjection.

145
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:34,599
So it basically even gives me an
explanation that the policy requires users

146
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:36,819
to complete multi-part authentication.

147
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:43,809
All I have to do is to click this and
apply the subjection, and it shows

148
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,879
that the subjection has been applied.

149
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:54,089
So now those two users are now covered
by multi authentication while assessing.

150
00:12:54,749 --> 00:13:02,239
This financial application, so basically
conditional assets optimization, it covers

151
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:10,239
across user drifts, your application
drifts, and even consolidates policies.

152
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:17,219
That is the beauty of AI
when used in cyber defense.

153
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:23,829
Next I want to talk about is
going straight to our data.

154
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:30,239
Now that we've seen how to manage
identity and assess management,

155
00:13:30,749 --> 00:13:36,839
managing gaps within our loop
organization, from application drift

156
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:40,199
to policy drift, and to policy.

157
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:46,729
Loopholes to even user drift data
move across like our organization

158
00:13:47,229 --> 00:13:53,900
from your SharePoint to your teams,
to your Outlook data move across, and

159
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,039
that is where Microsoft purview and
the security copilot comes into play.

160
00:13:58,369 --> 00:14:03,109
Basically managing the data
governance and data security.

161
00:14:03,995 --> 00:14:10,775
Of our organization leveraging data
loss prevention to ensure that there

162
00:14:10,775 --> 00:14:17,035
is no expiration or data oversharing
of sensitive information so that

163
00:14:17,364 --> 00:14:24,449
executive wound fear AI leakage risk,
or managing insider risk across ano

164
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:30,974
loss activities of users checking
for intentional or unintentional.

165
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:38,209
Activities carried out by users and
tracking it in real time with security.

166
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:45,739
Copilot prompts can then be leverage to
even assess users that are not covered by

167
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:51,829
data loss prevention policies or assess
the sequence of activities that users have

168
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:54,769
carried out or a nice insider has done.

169
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:58,129
In seconds, you can see what they've done.

170
00:14:58,129 --> 00:14:59,629
Either they downloaded documents.

171
00:15:00,154 --> 00:15:03,664
If they send sensitive documents
to their personal emails.

172
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:10,644
So that is the beauty of where we
use data governance, leveraging

173
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:16,044
artificial intelligence and making
it conversational in real time.

174
00:15:16,544 --> 00:15:21,399
Let's look at the demo
of how this is done.

175
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,509
Now I'm taking you to
the Microsoft Power View.

176
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:30,499
I'm going to click on Solutions, and here
you can see copilot is right here for us.

177
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:36,019
I'll click on Solutions right away
and click on data loss prevention.

178
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:39,109
So basically data loss
prevention is checking for.

179
00:15:39,609 --> 00:15:45,849
Data exposure to see information that
has sent out of your organization

180
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:47,829
or even within your organization.

181
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:53,519
Sensitive information gives you that
real time, a lot for you to check it,

182
00:15:54,479 --> 00:16:00,359
and you can also create policies when you
notice these gaps in your organization.

183
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,479
First, I'll click on policies.

184
00:16:02,979 --> 00:16:09,759
Now with copilot, all I have to do, I
can get insight on the existing policies

185
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,039
I have deployed in my organization.

186
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:15,069
I don't have to go
around searching around.

187
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:20,519
All I have to do is just click
this, get insight on policies.

188
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:24,209
I'm going to click get insight
on policies in my organization.

189
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:28,879
I've done that and I can
leverage either getting insight.

190
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:33,879
Based on location, based on
the classification of data.

191
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:39,729
So if I want to get insights
on my location, lemme check by

192
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:45,209
endpoint, for example, I click
this and it generates this for me.

193
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:50,129
It says, it gives me
information around the policies.

194
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:53,629
So what I can say here is.

195
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:59,289
Your policies are looking for data
in location, in the location of

196
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:05,139
endpoint devices with a total of 16
policies applied to the location.

197
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:09,159
So I already know the number of
policies applied to that location.

198
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:16,439
It shows me the type of information
from financial data, privacy and person.

199
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:20,424
So I have details of the
classification and all.

200
00:17:20,924 --> 00:17:25,934
I can also go ahead and get insight
based on another location, maybe

201
00:17:25,934 --> 00:17:28,514
exchange teams and all that.

202
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,874
Then let me click on alerts

203
00:17:31,374 --> 00:17:37,034
here is easy, so easily
get information on alerts.

204
00:17:37,034 --> 00:17:41,444
For example, if our policy has
triggered something, it can, I can

205
00:17:41,444 --> 00:17:43,574
easily get that information here.

206
00:17:44,114 --> 00:17:46,874
So I click on this and
let's check this first one.

207
00:17:46,874 --> 00:17:47,774
DSE policy.

208
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:53,810
DLP Policy match for a document,
POS lever, I click this.

209
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,169
So this is a document.

210
00:17:56,709 --> 00:18:02,889
Apparently a user was trying
to, or an employee was trying to

211
00:18:03,389 --> 00:18:05,305
download this document on a device.

212
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:09,975
And is a sensitive document,
the POS lever document.

213
00:18:10,515 --> 00:18:14,465
So all I have to do is to
come in here, go straight down

214
00:18:14,965 --> 00:18:17,024
and summarize the alert.

215
00:18:17,524 --> 00:18:20,694
So all I click this, summarize.

216
00:18:21,194 --> 00:18:24,404
Summarize a lot or
summarize user activity.

217
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:26,444
So I want to see a summary of the alert.

218
00:18:26,944 --> 00:18:32,314
It's already telling me that this
is a high severity DLP alert, and

219
00:18:32,314 --> 00:18:39,330
the next thing I can also do is give
me details of the policy as well.

220
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,540
Data match for the document.

221
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:48,189
So with prompts, you can easily get
this information within me seconds.

222
00:18:48,189 --> 00:18:52,330
So something that will take us
as you get it within seconds.

223
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,510
I can summarize user activity.

224
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,909
So see what the user has been up to.

225
00:18:58,409 --> 00:18:59,750
So here.

226
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,699
This shows that this a,
this like a insider risk.

227
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,480
The user is found to be involved
in inspiration activities on that.

228
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:14,430
On the same day, the user sent emails
with attachment outside the organization.

229
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:20,970
The user uploaded files to cloud storage,
which included files that were sensitive.

230
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,430
So it gives me the sequence of activities.

231
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,840
Collection of unusual
volume of sensitive files.

232
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:30,590
They also engaged in deleting files.

233
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:36,080
So it was a sequence of activity of where
the user uploaded information, sensitive

234
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:42,170
information into the cloud, sent that
attachment outside the organization and

235
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:44,480
then went ahead to delete those documents.

236
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,690
So this is more oh, maybe I
disgruntled the employee who

237
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,490
is exiting the organization.

238
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:51,005
And is not happy.

239
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:56,345
So with this prompt it has been,
I was able to get this information

240
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:59,875
in real time just using words.

241
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:06,145
So security co-pilots and prompts are
changing the way in which we manage

242
00:20:06,145 --> 00:20:12,495
our security landscape, making it
easier for security professionals.

243
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:19,280
Security analysts to move faster
and at the pace in which attackers

244
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,790
are exploiting our ecosystem.

245
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:29,250
Just like I have talked about prompts,
prompt is also like a new perimeter.

246
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,840
Now, we also need to safeguard
this prompts and audit

247
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,910
every activities or prompts.

248
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:43,860
Done by security analysts to ensure
that it is not compromised, ensuring

249
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:49,110
that there is auditability of every
process and treating security copilot

250
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:54,815
as a privileged assess surface because
security copilot is now is our teammates.

251
00:20:54,815 --> 00:20:58,655
So we need to track every
activities and ensure it is

252
00:20:58,655 --> 00:21:00,635
covered with the proper policies.

253
00:21:01,355 --> 00:21:02,385
As well.

254
00:21:02,385 --> 00:21:04,870
There should be need with critical pilots.

255
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,160
Visibility and speed must co exist.

256
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:14,880
There should not be in isolation so that
while we are leveraging prompts to combat

257
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,990
security challenges and work at the speed
of light, we can also ensure that our

258
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,810
security copilot is protected as well.

259
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:28,520
AI isn't here to replace us.

260
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:35,220
It is here to reveal where we
must evolve because attackers

261
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,340
already speak AI fluently.

262
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:46,050
It's time for defenders security
professionals to also do from

263
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:54,260
prompts to protection, from noise to
insight, from reaction to resilience.

264
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:00,560
If we can't out cold attackers,
we should outthink them.

265
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,700
And the new language is our words.

266
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,400
Leveraging prompts to combat
security challenges to combat the

267
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,250
trade landscape, leveraging prompts.

268
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:18,205
As our weapons defenders
don't fail from lack of skill.

269
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:24,275
They fail from lack of skill, lack
of context, because they can't

270
00:22:24,275 --> 00:22:29,465
manage the speed in which these
floods and alerts are coming in.

271
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:36,940
So encourage everyone to leverage the
user's prompts in mitigating security.

272
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:44,130
In managing our security posture as it'll
save us a lot of time and ensure that we

273
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:48,870
become proactive rather than reactive.

274
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,720
Thank you very much.

275
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,650
Feel free to connect with me on
LinkedIn, and it's been a great

276
00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:02,550
pleasure to be part of the Prompt
Engineering 2025 conference by.
