1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,930
This is Sunil.

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:02,770
Little introduction about me.

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:07,570
I'm a seasoned database administrator,
worked on different technologies

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:12,850
across different multinationals
at different geographies.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:18,069
Today I'm going to talk about machine
learning power database resilience

6
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:21,789
predictive analytics for 99.98.

7
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:23,200
Oracle Cloud availability.

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,970
So basically the cost of downtime for any
database is permitted nine over $9,000.

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,710
And financially the impact
is huge, the whole year.

10
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,710
So by doing machine learning based
anatomy detection, you can early

11
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:44,510
detect the issues and take a preventive
action and improve the uptime overall.

12
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,410
Basically deep learning
performance metrics.

13
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,200
It helps you, it helps the model.

14
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,610
Recognize the pattern first, and
then in five second intervals,

15
00:00:54,610 --> 00:01:00,275
it keeps judging what is the
analysis on the pattern going on.

16
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,900
And then what are the invisible
sectors available to leverage

17
00:01:05,085 --> 00:01:07,495
the neural networks in the whole.

18
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:08,630
Machine system.

19
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,300
Then optimizing the Oracle cluster
and reinforcement learning.

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,220
That's how the entire cycle works.

21
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:20,000
Monitor, learn, optimize, validate,
keep doing the same during

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,800
networks for data guard tuning.

23
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:27,650
This is again, for the high availability
as well as scalability by using

24
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,945
synchronized duplication, minimal
performance impact and fast the company.

25
00:01:33,445 --> 00:01:34,675
Like within seconds.

26
00:01:35,175 --> 00:01:39,525
So ROI is return on investment
of machine learning resilience.

27
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:48,795
It's 287% ROI in eight months payback
time with 99.98% availability.

28
00:01:49,215 --> 00:01:51,590
So that's huge in my understanding.

29
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,465
Again, the predictive auto scaling
benefits, because like we said, the

30
00:01:56,525 --> 00:02:00,485
machine learning, there's a model
to learn and optimize accordingly.

31
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:06,850
The overall goal is to reduce the cost by
not compromising on the availability of

32
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,030
the performance of the entire solution.

33
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,480
There are case studies where 99.98
availability is achieved in financial

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,830
services, healthcare, retail, and
basically all the line of businesses

35
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:26,460
across, the different modules, the
scalable AI framework, is it like it

36
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,890
can't be scaled to any level by horizontal
vertical using cross architecture

37
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,140
compatibility, automated and all
detection add engineer productivity

38
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,910
overall by using machine learning.

39
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,840
So transforming database resilience.

40
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,060
It's discover, implement, optimize,
and achieve the goal, which is.

41
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,015
Is close to a hundred percent
availability, but we, there are a

42
00:02:51,015 --> 00:02:56,550
few percentage or less than a percent
non unforeseen issues that can occur.

43
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,030
Thanks a lot for your time and I hope
you could have some idea about the

44
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,250
topic we wanted to discuss today.

45
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,150
Thank you again.
