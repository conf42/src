00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,250
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:05,790
I'm Chita Eshi and I'm principal
Product Manager working on

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,439
the cybersecurity industry.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,040
I have close to eight years of
experience working as a product manager,

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,320
mainly in the cybersecurity space.

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,640
In the last couple of years,
the importance of edge computing

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,540
has grown significantly.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,120
With the increase in edge computing,
the security risk have also gone up.

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:32,670
So today I'm here to talk about
the importance of observability

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,129
to ensure edge devices are secure.

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,540
So let's get started.

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,150
Before talking about the security
challenges associated with edge

13
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:47,720
computing, let's talk about why edge
market size is increasing significantly.

14
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,960
First of all when all the applications
are running on the cloud, either

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,640
public cloud or private cloud.

16
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:01,210
The latency between the application
and the cloud is significantly higher.

17
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:07,980
However, if all those applications start
running on the edge, that reducing,

18
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,990
that reduces the network latency
significantly to mere millisecond.

19
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:19,085
As a result, applications that
need near real time response are

20
00:01:19,085 --> 00:01:21,125
better suited for edge computing.

21
00:01:21,695 --> 00:01:24,635
Second of all, operational efficiency.

22
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:29,195
Imagine a situation where your critical
applications are running in the public.

23
00:01:29,195 --> 00:01:34,085
One, if the internet goes down, let's
take an example of a self-driving car.

24
00:01:34,415 --> 00:01:39,575
Let's say self-driving car is running
in the remote location where there

25
00:01:39,575 --> 00:01:42,155
is a limited internet connectivity.

26
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:45,345
What happens in that situation?

27
00:01:45,345 --> 00:01:49,475
If there is a critical decisions that
need to be made by the self-driving

28
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:53,675
car, without the internet connectivity,
it won't be able to make the right

29
00:01:53,675 --> 00:01:59,045
decision, and that is where the importance
of edge computing really matters.

30
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:03,455
With edge computing, even if the
internet connection is lost for the

31
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:08,165
timing, the application or the device
will continue to function as it is.

32
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:12,515
Ensuring the operation
resiliency as well as efficiency.

33
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,545
Last thing is the reduced bandwidth.

34
00:02:16,255 --> 00:02:19,285
Imagine all the applications
running in the public cloud.

35
00:02:19,685 --> 00:02:24,365
Then there will be a significant data
transfer between the application running

36
00:02:24,365 --> 00:02:29,015
on the edge and rest of the database
running, or the rest of the applications

37
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:33,755
running on the cloud that will require
significant ban bandwidth consumption.

38
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:41,195
With edge computing, a lot of the data
processing happens locally, which results

39
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:43,925
in reduction in the bandwidth required.

40
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:49,415
Just now let's talk about
the US Edge computing market.

41
00:02:49,895 --> 00:02:56,435
As of 2025, the US Edge computing
market is already over one $60 billion.

42
00:02:56,675 --> 00:03:00,390
However, by 2034, it is expected to go.

43
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:07,260
As high as $1.5 trillion, which
is a growth of 25% year over

44
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,385
year, between 2025 and 2034.

45
00:03:10,885 --> 00:03:15,325
Because of this high growth,
the importance of edge computing

46
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:20,365
as well as security associated
with the Edge computing devices

47
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:22,345
is increasing day by day.

48
00:03:22,845 --> 00:03:27,885
Let's talk about the security challenges
associated with the Edge devices.

49
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:35,020
First of all, edge devices operate outside
the traditional network boundaries.

50
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,040
Today, most of the applications
are running on the public cloud.

51
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,760
However, there are some applications which
are still running on the private cloud.

52
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,820
Now, edge computing devices operate
outside this network boundary.

53
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:54,170
As a result, the traditional
monitoring tools that are monitoring.

54
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,480
Cloud applications as well as the
hybrid or on-prem applications,

55
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,190
they are oblivious to what is
happening on the edge devices.

56
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,550
Secondly, limited visibility.

57
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:15,290
The legacy monitoring system usually
lack the ability to detect edge specific

58
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:22,420
threats, compromises, or if there are
any unusual behavior in the edge devices.

59
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:30,175
Now because of that, attacker can take
advantage of this edge devices and

60
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:35,785
then they can treat edge devices as an
entry point to get inside the network.

61
00:04:36,385 --> 00:04:42,085
Once they are inside the network edge
devices are obviously talking to rest

62
00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:46,225
of the applications running on public
and private cloud as well, right?

63
00:04:46,725 --> 00:04:52,105
Bad actors can take advantage of this
situation and once they are inside

64
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:56,995
the network, they can penetrate the
threats to the rest of the organization.

65
00:04:57,445 --> 00:05:02,785
And that is why observability is so
important for all the applications

66
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:08,715
running on the edge because of these
threat challenges on the edge devices.

67
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:14,250
The threat landscape of the edge
devices has gone up significantly

68
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,780
in the last couple of years.

69
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:22,590
According to one of the recent studies,
45, 40 5% of the organizations have

70
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:28,289
experienced at least one significant
edge security incident in last one year.

71
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:34,470
Here are some of the ways that attackers
attack the edge device network.

72
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,350
First of all, the network
mentioned in the previous slide.

73
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,650
Lot of times edge devices
have limited CPU and memory.

74
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:44,699
As a result.

75
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:50,620
There is always a compromise between the
fast response and the security capability.

76
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:57,259
Now, lot of times because for edge
devices, speed is really important.

77
00:05:57,619 --> 00:06:03,169
Lot of times network security teams or a
security team end up compromising on the

78
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:05,749
security capabilities of the Edge devices.

79
00:06:06,109 --> 00:06:13,729
Now attacker can take advantage of
this situation to make edge device

80
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:16,299
as an entry point for their attack.

81
00:06:16,304 --> 00:06:16,724
Attack.

82
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:20,799
Once the edge device is
infected, attacker will try to.

83
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,409
Move their threats or mal malware
laterally to the rest of the organization,

84
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:29,999
to the cloud devices or on-prem devices.

85
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:34,679
As a result, edge devices need
to be secured all the time.

86
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:37,950
The second is data breaches.

87
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:42,659
Many times the edge devices
are not properly secured.

88
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:47,609
There is a lack of observability on
the behavior of the edge devices.

89
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:52,189
And many times, many of these edge
devices have unencrypted data.

90
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:57,889
As a result, they become the easy
target for the bad actors, and

91
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:02,429
once bad actors have the access to
the edge devices, they can easily

92
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:05,189
exfiltrate the rest of the network has.

93
00:07:05,489 --> 00:07:08,639
Finally, third thing is the DDoS attack.

94
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:11,989
The edge devices have limited capability.

95
00:07:12,544 --> 00:07:16,794
To protect against attacks which
are sophisticated in nature.

96
00:07:17,634 --> 00:07:26,604
With the beginning of AI era, botnets are
often designed to create the DDoS attacks.

97
00:07:26,994 --> 00:07:31,524
Considering the edge devices have limited
capability to protect against such

98
00:07:31,524 --> 00:07:36,714
attacks, on top of that edge devices are
not properly secured from time to time.

99
00:07:37,644 --> 00:07:41,304
Edge devices are especially
vulnerable to DDoS attacks.

100
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:47,624
Because of this increased threat landscape
for the Edge devices, it is important

101
00:07:47,624 --> 00:07:53,624
to continuously observe the edge devices
for their normal behavior so that we

102
00:07:53,624 --> 00:07:57,764
can identify the difference between the
known normal behavior and the attack.

103
00:07:58,154 --> 00:08:02,984
And on top of that, it is important to
secure the edge devices because they are

104
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:05,684
the extension of the existing network.

105
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:10,134
All the existing applications running
on public cloud and privately private.

106
00:08:10,134 --> 00:08:15,104
Next, let's talk about the importance
of observability for your edge devices.

107
00:08:15,604 --> 00:08:21,154
In order to identify the attack or
the malicious activity for the edge

108
00:08:21,154 --> 00:08:27,004
devices, it is really important to
continuously monitor the edge devices

109
00:08:27,004 --> 00:08:29,729
in real time in order to do that.

110
00:08:30,004 --> 00:08:35,664
Re edge devices should be equipped with
smaller micro agents, which will be

111
00:08:35,664 --> 00:08:41,814
able to detect the behavior of the edge
devices along with the CPU and memory

112
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:47,444
footprint of the applications based
on the subtle differences, indifferent

113
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:53,254
signals, along with CPU and memory
utilization, the observability tool.

114
00:08:53,754 --> 00:08:58,764
Should be able to detect any suspicious
activity or unusual behavior.

115
00:08:58,764 --> 00:09:03,894
For the Edge devices, this is
applicable not only for a single Edge

116
00:09:03,894 --> 00:09:09,864
device, but this should be implemented
across all the Edge devices as well.

117
00:09:10,364 --> 00:09:15,284
And with Observate observability
tool, you should be able to correlate

118
00:09:16,094 --> 00:09:20,664
these signals, these metrics
across different edge devices.

119
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:24,309
So that you can identify
the attack in real time.

120
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:30,749
Once the attack or the unusual behavior
is identified, there should be a

121
00:09:30,749 --> 00:09:36,539
automated process or automated defense
mechanism so that rather than waiting

122
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:42,479
for the manual intervention, the
observability tool or the security devices

123
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:48,289
should be able to take the necessary
corrective action within milliseconds.

124
00:09:48,634 --> 00:09:54,184
So that Compromise device is
isolated, and that will ensure that

125
00:09:54,184 --> 00:09:58,264
threats are not moving laterally
to the rest of the organization.

126
00:09:59,074 --> 00:10:03,664
Now that we covered how to implement
observability tools and monitoring

127
00:10:03,664 --> 00:10:07,684
tools for your edge devices in
your architecture, let's talk

128
00:10:07,684 --> 00:10:13,414
about the impact of implementing
observability for your edge devices.

129
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:16,204
Here is the case study of the large.

130
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,889
Automotive manufacturing plant.

131
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:24,049
This particular customer
implemented edge security monitoring

132
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:25,579
for three straight months.

133
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:31,969
Within three months, they were able to
reduce the incident escalations by 78%.

134
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:37,639
Secondly, they were able
to identify 89% of the.

135
00:10:37,744 --> 00:10:43,664
Unauthorized access attempts between the
edge system and the core infrastructure

136
00:10:43,664 --> 00:10:46,034
that resided on public and private cloud.

137
00:10:46,534 --> 00:10:52,104
Third advantage was they were able
to identify 80% of the critical

138
00:10:52,104 --> 00:10:58,374
security anomaly within literally their
first hour of deploying the Observa

139
00:10:58,494 --> 00:11:00,774
observability tool on their edge devices.

140
00:11:01,404 --> 00:11:06,894
The end result was that after introducing
observability and monitoring tools

141
00:11:06,894 --> 00:11:13,014
for their edge device, they were able
to reduce MTDD, which is mean time to

142
00:11:13,014 --> 00:11:20,454
detection from 1 97 hours to only four
hours, which was a significant improvement

143
00:11:20,964 --> 00:11:25,504
on on how they were implementing
edge security for their environment.

144
00:11:26,004 --> 00:11:31,484
Before talking about how to implement
observability and monitoring for your

145
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:36,974
edge devices, let's talk about how to
secure edge devices because monitoring and

146
00:11:37,274 --> 00:11:39,254
observability are just a starting point.

147
00:11:39,644 --> 00:11:43,814
So here are some ways, first of
all, continuous authentication.

148
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:49,604
So all the devices and all the users
should be authenticated all the time.

149
00:11:50,104 --> 00:11:55,144
The normal policy would be,
verify everything, trust nothing.

150
00:11:55,684 --> 00:11:58,804
And this aligns with the zero
trust architecture as well.

151
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:04,644
The second most important thing to do is
provide the least privilege enforcement.

152
00:12:04,884 --> 00:12:11,074
Basically, if an employee is requesting an
access to any particular resources, either

153
00:12:11,074 --> 00:12:13,444
on the edge device or on the public cloud.

154
00:12:13,969 --> 00:12:19,019
We should be providing minimum privileges
to that employee to get the work done.

155
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:23,384
More the privileges for that person, the
higher the chance that if the vulner,

156
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:29,319
if that particular user is compromised,
it'll in impact or infect the rest the

157
00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:31,329
other parts of the infrastructure as well.

158
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:35,559
Third important thing to do is
implement the micro segmentation.

159
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:40,829
What microsegmentation is to divide the
network, either on the edge or on the

160
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:46,529
cloud, into different subsections so that
even if one of the devices either on the

161
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:52,319
edge or on the cloud are infected, it
won't, the threat won't spread to the rest

162
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:57,299
of the infrastructure easily so that you
can minimize the impact of the breach.

163
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:02,699
And third or the last important thing
is to implement the runtime protection.

164
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:08,419
Even after implementing all these
policies, there are chances that your

165
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:13,379
applications running are impacted by
unpatched and unknown vulnerability.

166
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,849
One example I would like to give
here is the log four J vulnerability.

167
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:18,869
Log four J.

168
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:23,430
Vulnerability was detected in
the software in December, 2021.

169
00:13:24,344 --> 00:13:28,094
Even though it existed in a
software for seven plus years.

170
00:13:28,364 --> 00:13:32,534
So even after implementing all the
right measures, it is possible that

171
00:13:32,534 --> 00:13:37,394
you might be impacted by unpacked and
unknown vulnerabilities, and to protect

172
00:13:37,394 --> 00:13:42,134
against those, you need to have the
runtime security protection in place.

173
00:13:42,494 --> 00:13:46,479
So here are the steps you can
take to secure your edge devices.

174
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:51,060
Please note that monitoring is just
the first step You need to implement

175
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,689
these additional measures to ensure
your edge devices and the rest of

176
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:58,739
the infrastructure are secure from
the malware and the bad actors.

177
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:03,650
Before talking about how to implement
monitoring and observability

178
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:07,459
for your edge devices, let's
think about our overall goal.

179
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:11,300
In the large organization you would have.

180
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:16,069
The devices across devices
and applications across

181
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:17,509
all different environments.

182
00:14:17,869 --> 00:14:22,339
Lot of the organizations today would
have applications running on cloud.

183
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,899
That includes AWS or Jaw, GCP, and some
of the other cloud providers as well.

184
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:31,244
They would also have some applications
running on premises system like Red

185
00:14:31,244 --> 00:14:33,529
Hat, OpenShift, ESXI, and others.

186
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:37,729
On top of that, they will have
the Network, secu Network fabric.

187
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:42,069
From which all the data is being
transferred from one place to the other.

188
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:46,269
So all these things have
to be secured properly.

189
00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:50,649
On top of that, there should be an
end-to-end visibility and monitoring

190
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,089
across all these different infrastructure,
including cloud, infrastructure,

191
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:57,039
on-prem, and network fabric.

192
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,479
Additionally.

193
00:14:59,055 --> 00:15:03,255
Lot of the companies are starting
to have the edge devices on top

194
00:15:03,255 --> 00:15:04,755
of that manufacturing plant.

195
00:15:04,755 --> 00:15:10,205
Also have the IOT devices, which are
monitoring different parts of the plant.

196
00:15:10,295 --> 00:15:14,005
And then they are providing
the critical data all the time.

197
00:15:14,425 --> 00:15:20,005
So in order to get end-to-end visibility
across the entire environment, it is

198
00:15:20,005 --> 00:15:24,175
really important that observability
across all these different tools

199
00:15:24,175 --> 00:15:26,125
are integrated so that you can get.

200
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,360
Complete visibility into your infra
entire in infrastructure, irrespective

201
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,040
of whether your applications are running
on public cloud, private cloud, on

202
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,560
premises, on IOT devices, and so on.

203
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,870
And once you correlate this data from D
coming from different devices, then only

204
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:48,400
you will be able to have centralized
visibility, centralized monitoring,

205
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:53,200
and that will help you enhance your
security capability in the long run.

206
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:59,550
Finally, let's talk about how to
implement and introduce monitoring and

207
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,190
observability for your edge devices.

208
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,730
First of all, start with the assessment.

209
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:11,830
Identify all the edge devices and
critical vulnerabilities or point

210
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,650
of vulnerability that you think
that are part of your edge device.

211
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:21,520
Second point would be to
identify the most critical edge

212
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,380
device that you want to secure.

213
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,770
Once you have identified that, start
implementing the observability and

214
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,470
monitoring tools for a single edge device.

215
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:37,020
And over time, implement the
performance to see how you are able

216
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,030
to reduce your mean time to detection.

217
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:43,810
How are you able to ensure reduction
in lateral movements of threats as

218
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:48,850
well as other improvements once you
have seen significant improvement

219
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,740
in your mean time to detection.

220
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,050
Also called as MTTD.

221
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:59,320
You can integrate your edge monitoring
with the rest of the platform.

222
00:16:59,545 --> 00:17:02,485
And the rest of the platform
could be running on the public

223
00:17:02,485 --> 00:17:04,135
cloud, private cloud, anywhere.

224
00:17:04,405 --> 00:17:09,445
That way you can get consolidated single
pane of monitoring and observability

225
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:11,185
across your entire environment.

226
00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:16,945
Once you feel that you have integrated
your single or few of your edge

227
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:21,265
devices with the rest of the platform,
the next step and the final step

228
00:17:21,265 --> 00:17:26,965
would be expand that to your entire
Edge network available anywhere.

229
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:32,050
This will be specifically
challenging for the organizations

230
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,580
that have edge devices worldwide.

231
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:40,640
So by integrating all the devices
worldwide with your entire in rest

232
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,240
of the infrastructure that includes
public cloud, private cloud, network,

233
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,010
fabric, IOT devices, you will be
able to get a centralized visibility.

234
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,510
And monitoring across your entire devices.

235
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:57,040
And that is the roadmap that we laid
out in the previous previous slide.

236
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:02,440
So once you have that visibility, you will
be able to completely visualize everything

237
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,540
that is going in your environment.

238
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:08,080
And over the long run, you will
be able to improve the security

239
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,350
posture of your edge devices, as
well as your entire infrastructure.

240
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,995
With that, I want to
thank you for your time.

241
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:21,945
Hope this session was helpful on how
monitoring and observability for your edge

242
00:18:21,945 --> 00:18:26,925
devices, plays a critical role in securing
your edge infrastructure as well as your

243
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:29,565
entire organizations in infrastructure.

244
00:18:29,955 --> 00:18:34,035
Thanks a lot and feel free to reach out to
me if you have any additional questions.

245
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:34,395
Thank you.
