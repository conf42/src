1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,900
Okay, good.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,029
Good morning.

3
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:02,930
Good evening everybody.

4
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:04,490
Thank you for being here.

5
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:09,200
My name is Kasi, and today I want
to talk about a fundamental shift in

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,499
how we build and deploy artificial
intelligence in the enterprise softwares.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,860
We are moving beyond simple, isolated
AI tools, and we are entering

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,390
into an era of orchestration.

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,390
The presentation is about the.

10
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:30,860
Designing multi-agent AI systems that
can intelligently navigate our most

11
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:36,620
complex environments, which is our
ERPs and how our hybrid IT systems.

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,300
For the last few years, the
enterprise AI has often looked

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,370
like this, a series of silent.

14
00:00:42,895 --> 00:00:43,615
Pilots.

15
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:48,025
For example, a marketing chart
bot here and a finance tool there,

16
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:49,645
an onboarding tool elsewhere.

17
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:53,665
They're all totally disconnected,
fragmented, and it requires

18
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:57,175
a ton of manual overhead to
make them talk to each other.

19
00:00:57,955 --> 00:00:58,555
The model is.

20
00:00:59,045 --> 00:01:02,615
Often broken and it
doesn't scale the future.

21
00:01:02,615 --> 00:01:05,345
And what we are building today
is an adaptive ecosystem.

22
00:01:05,435 --> 00:01:11,435
This is a move from isolated experiments
to coordinated networks of AI agents that

23
00:01:11,435 --> 00:01:13,865
provide enterprise wide intelligence.

24
00:01:14,285 --> 00:01:15,590
The they orchestrate data.

25
00:01:16,445 --> 00:01:20,015
And most importantly, they
can autonomously optimize

26
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:21,245
enterprise workflows.

27
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:24,155
This is the challenge and
opportunity we will be exploring.

28
00:01:24,655 --> 00:01:28,465
So exactly what is exact, what
exactly is a multi-agent system.

29
00:01:28,675 --> 00:01:32,965
It is a helpful, it is helpful to
stop thinking about one single ai

30
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:38,354
instead, think of a team of specialized
experts, autonomous agents, coordinated

31
00:01:38,354 --> 00:01:40,935
actions, and a goal directed steps.

32
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:45,095
Autonomous agency, the agent is
an AI entity with a specific role.

33
00:01:45,245 --> 00:01:49,054
You might have a data analyst agent,
you might have a compliance agent,

34
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:50,705
and you might have an inventory agent.

35
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:55,234
Your data analyst agent, again,
can be subdivided into specialized

36
00:01:55,234 --> 00:01:59,644
in bioinformatics, for example,
genetics, for example, and whatnot.

37
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:03,955
When it comes to coordinated action, these
agents don't just have to work alone.

38
00:02:04,164 --> 00:02:07,914
They must be able to communicate,
collaborate, and delegate tasks

39
00:02:07,914 --> 00:02:12,295
to solve problems that are far
too complex for any single agent.

40
00:02:12,795 --> 00:02:14,625
And they do this with a purpose.

41
00:02:14,775 --> 00:02:18,505
The system is given a high level
enterprise objective, reduce

42
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:23,065
procurement cost by 10%, and the
agents work together to achieve it

43
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:25,135
with minimal human intervention.

44
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,160
So next, what are the main four
main pillars for this enterprise?

45
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,090
AA orchestration.

46
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,550
There are four pillars
for this orchestration.

47
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,680
The first one is a goal directed planning.

48
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,440
Always planning is the most important one.

49
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,330
The system must be able to take a big
complex goal and break it down into small

50
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,040
and executable tasks for each agent.

51
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,010
Second, dynamic reflection.

52
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,060
This is crucial.

53
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,080
The system must be able to
look at its own performance.

54
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,160
Learn from its successes and
failures and get smarter over time.

55
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,170
Third, tool orchestration.

56
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,100
The agents are useless if they
can't interact with the real world.

57
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,850
The pillar is about giving them
access to your existing tools, your

58
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,190
APIs, your database, and your ERPs.

59
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,890
And finally, collaborative
problem solving.

60
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,060
This is the multi-agent.

61
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,780
Magic agents share insights and
coordinate actions to tackle challenges

62
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,270
that cross departmental silos.

63
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,210
This isn't just theory.

64
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,900
These are powerful frameworks
available right now that allow

65
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,220
us to build these systems.

66
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:34,010
Auto Gen is coming from Microsoft Graph is
a graph based structure, which is perfect

67
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,510
for complex cyclical workflows where
agents might need to rethink a problem,

68
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,070
what we call a cyclical reasoning.

69
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,570
When it comes to auto gen, it
is very excellent for creating

70
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:49,520
conversational agents that can
solve task together and crew ai.

71
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,420
Provides a role-based framework.

72
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,829
You literally define your agents
like a team, a senior researcher,

73
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,149
a writer, a manager, and they
collaborate based on the hierarchy.

74
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:01,855
Okay, let's make this real.

75
00:04:02,005 --> 00:04:04,585
Where is this being applied
or is it just theory?

76
00:04:04,915 --> 00:04:08,845
These things are getting applied
in procurement applications, in

77
00:04:08,845 --> 00:04:12,785
procurement business in finance,
in hr, and in document management.

78
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:16,145
For example, when it comes to
procurement, I'm seeing automated

79
00:04:16,145 --> 00:04:20,170
supplier evaluation, contract compliance
monitoring, running 24 class seven.

80
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:22,405
Across global supply chains.

81
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,625
When it comes to finance,
this is a game changer.

82
00:04:25,045 --> 00:04:28,435
Think automated invoice processing,
real time expense reconciliation, an

83
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:34,045
anoma anomaly deduction that not only
finds fraud, but also generates the

84
00:04:34,045 --> 00:04:38,155
audit trial in hr, we are automating
the entire onboarding workflows

85
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,815
using conventional interfaces to
resolve employee queries instantly.

86
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:46,965
And when it comes to document management,
agents can classify, extract, structure,

87
00:04:46,965 --> 00:04:51,975
data, and route documents to the right
person, eliminating massive bottlenecks.

88
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:52,865
How?

89
00:04:52,865 --> 00:04:57,215
How are the business impact measures
and the business impact is not trivial.

90
00:04:57,455 --> 00:05:01,745
These are real measured results
from multi-agent deployments.

91
00:05:01,895 --> 00:05:06,815
We are seeing an average of 65, 60
8% reduction in processing time in

92
00:05:06,815 --> 00:05:11,405
workflows like procurement and finance,
and 92% improvement in accuracy

93
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:16,115
for tasks like data extraction and
a 45% gain in cost efficiency by

94
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,215
optimizing workflows and removing.

95
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,810
Manual, repetitive work.

96
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,670
This isn't just incremental increment.

97
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,010
It's a step change in
operational efficiency.

98
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,950
Next comes the integration between Hi
between different EA agents in ER within

99
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,590
ERP and also in hybrid IT landscapes.

100
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,790
Now for everyone in this room who manages
enterprise it, the first question is,

101
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,070
this sounds great, but I have a massive
complex SAP system and Oracle system.

102
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,600
How does this possibly integrate?

103
00:05:42,665 --> 00:05:46,110
This is the most important
part we don't rip and replace.

104
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,160
The beauty of multi-agent framework
is its modular architecture.

105
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,320
You can adapt it incrementally.

106
00:05:52,565 --> 00:05:56,555
The agents connect to your existing
systems, both cloud and on-prem

107
00:05:56,975 --> 00:05:58,955
through standard APIs and middleware.

108
00:05:59,045 --> 00:06:03,425
The you can start by automating
one small part of the process.

109
00:06:03,725 --> 00:06:07,655
This approach massively reduces
risk, accelerates your time to

110
00:06:07,655 --> 00:06:12,245
value, and lets you modernize without
breaking the bank or your business.

111
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,330
Next is about the critical
implementation challenges.

112
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,370
Of course, this is not without challenges.

113
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,980
You have to go into this
with your open eyes.

114
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,240
There are three critical hurdles,
security, data, privacy, scalability,

115
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,530
governance, and compliance.

116
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,410
We are giving agents
access to sensitive data.

117
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,680
This demands, I'm sorry,
this demands robust.

118
00:06:32,055 --> 00:06:35,175
Authentication and governance,
and it comes to scalability.

119
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:38,625
As you grow from 10 to 1000
agents, how do you manage

120
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,275
computational resources and cost?

121
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:43,785
When it comes to governance and
compliance, this is a big one.

122
00:06:43,785 --> 00:06:48,345
If an agent makes a decision on behalf of
somebody you must have an audit trial on.

123
00:06:48,345 --> 00:06:49,455
What does it think?

124
00:06:49,845 --> 00:06:51,285
Why does it make a decision?

125
00:06:51,315 --> 00:06:54,075
And you must be able to satisfy
the regulators and build the

126
00:06:54,075 --> 00:06:55,725
trust based on your audit logs.

127
00:06:56,225 --> 00:06:59,495
Next is what are the
strategies for safe adoption?

128
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:01,655
So we spoke about challenges.

129
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:04,295
We spoke, we got excited,
we spoke about challenges.

130
00:07:04,325 --> 00:07:07,235
Now it's time for us to know how
do we address these challenges.

131
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,545
First is comprehensive audit logging.

132
00:07:09,575 --> 00:07:11,195
Second is bounded autonomy.

133
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:13,875
And finally, incremental deployment.

134
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:17,265
So we briefly spoke about audit, logging.

135
00:07:17,415 --> 00:07:21,495
Every decision, every action, every piece
of data and agent touches must be logged

136
00:07:21,495 --> 00:07:23,745
for transparency, bounded autonomy.

137
00:07:23,745 --> 00:07:24,825
This is a key concept.

138
00:07:24,855 --> 00:07:26,625
Agents are not given free reign.

139
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,980
We define clear operational boundaries,
and most importantly, we program

140
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,870
escalation path for human oversight.

141
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:36,050
A human is always in the
loop for critical decisions.

142
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,000
Finally, incremental deployment.

143
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,350
Don't try to boil the ocean.

144
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,720
Start with a low risk,
high value use case.

145
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,180
Validate this results, then expand.

146
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:48,080
Next is building your
multi-agent roadmap, right?

147
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,720
Your path to adoption must look like this.

148
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,480
First is foundation, followed by piloting.

149
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:59,585
Next is scaling and finally optimizing it
again to summarize this right all what we

150
00:07:59,585 --> 00:08:01,655
are saying is don't try to boil the ocean.

151
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,759
Access your current state, and
find that the first high value use

152
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,290
case is going to be implemented.

153
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:08,369
Pilot it.

154
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,489
Define your first agents in
a re controlled environment.

155
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:12,509
Measure everything.

156
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,190
Scale, expand the successful
partners across other departments.

157
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,509
Now optimizing.

158
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:20,759
This is where you truly
orchestration, orchestrate.

159
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,805
You enable autonomous agent collaboration
and create self-learning capabilities.

160
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,975
Next is the end goal is here.

161
00:08:28,155 --> 00:08:28,635
End goal.

162
00:08:28,635 --> 00:08:30,435
Here is a fundamental shift in thinking.

163
00:08:30,615 --> 00:08:34,125
We are not just building tactical
projects, we are building a self

164
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,835
optimizing digital ecosystem.

165
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:42,075
One where agents learn, adapt to changing
business conditions and coate autonomously

166
00:08:42,075 --> 00:08:44,325
creating enterprise wide intelligence.

167
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,130
Okay, next is our playbook.

168
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,140
First is Playbook is a very clean one.

169
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,030
First is you have a design.

170
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,130
Second is integrate and then Scale.

171
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,170
And what is our key takeaways?

172
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:01,030
The key takeaways from the last 10
