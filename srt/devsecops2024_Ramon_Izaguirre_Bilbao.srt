00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,930
Hello and welcome to this conference.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,390
Thank you very much for
attending this presentation.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,210
Today we are going to introduce
you to a very innovative

4
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:13,989
Solution for cyber security.

5
00:00:14,489 --> 00:00:20,000
We are going to, start with the
first slide and introduce some of the

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:28,900
concepts and I will deliberately, go
slow so all these concepts can be well

7
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:37,089
digested because some of them may be
relatively new or relatively not very

8
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:39,770
common in the world of cyber security.

9
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,670
So first thing first.

10
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,230
Internet2.

11
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:50,120
ai, so number two is because This is
the evolution of internet in a more

12
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:59,150
secure internet and AI because we do
use AI in most or all of our processes.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,550
And in particular, we use that
in a very key process in this

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,290
solution that we will explain later.

15
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,520
We are, as long as we are
aware, The first company in the

16
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,340
world for doing ISP reputation.

17
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:21,220
So basically ISP reputation
is to put a rating to the ISP.

18
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,320
Originating the traffic.

19
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:28,640
So when we receive traffic from internet,
from a specific network that belongs to an

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:37,110
ISP, we know how good or bad this specific
ISP and network has behaved in internet.

21
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,030
And for this purpose,
we use multiple ways.

22
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,970
We will go in detail in
the other slides, but.

23
00:01:45,685 --> 00:01:51,595
It is good that you start understanding
that this solution or this approach

24
00:01:51,765 --> 00:01:57,335
is different from what you are used
to see, in the cybersecurity space.

25
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:04,285
This time, we are going to start the
controls in the ISP originating the

26
00:02:04,285 --> 00:02:10,105
traffic, not on the destination of
the traffic where your company is.

27
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,720
We are going to take one step forward
and enhance the security perimeter.

28
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,840
Basically, this is all about.

29
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:24,200
If you understand this concept, the
enhancement of the security perimeter,

30
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,730
this is what it is all about.

31
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:32,190
Based on a specific technology related to
the rating, to the reputation of the ISP.

32
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:38,680
But the concept is this enhancement of the
security perimeter, which by the way, is

33
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:47,020
a concept that in other areas of defense,
like the military, it is a very well

34
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,960
understood, technique or strategy to use.

35
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:57,680
When we say AI being used in
our processes, there is one key

36
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,840
process, which is the, the rating.

37
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,200
So what rating we apply to
different scenarios of the ISPs,

38
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,560
networks delivering traffic.

39
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:18,840
this policy is dictated by AI
with very minimal human oversight.

40
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,620
So let's go slide by slide,
introducing the concept in more depth.

41
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,170
So the security challenge,
the current landscape.

42
00:03:29,575 --> 00:03:30,765
is terrible.

43
00:03:31,265 --> 00:03:36,455
The threats are evolving, we get more
threats, defending an organization is

44
00:03:36,565 --> 00:03:40,445
really difficult these days because
they attack from multiple places,

45
00:03:40,905 --> 00:03:45,625
they are dedicated, dedicated,
targeting, there are different types

46
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,295
of attackers, so it's really difficult.

47
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:56,265
And unfortunately, I have to say that
if that was a race, we are not winning.

48
00:03:56,765 --> 00:04:02,875
At least, what we hear from the
media is that large organizations

49
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:09,175
with many resources, they
are also victims of attacks.

50
00:04:10,095 --> 00:04:15,745
Which make us think that there
is something that needs to

51
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:21,365
change, but something at the
base, something different.

52
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:26,945
We need to do something different if we
want to change the direction of the race.

53
00:04:27,445 --> 00:04:34,709
So basically, the speed this is going,
we do need to take action on it.

54
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,070
As soon as possible.

55
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:45,240
Okay, so at the moment, in cyber
security, the main idea, different

56
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,050
colors, good, but the idea is to
do the defense at destination.

57
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,430
You put firewalls, you put all type of
defenses when you receive the traffic

58
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,400
from internet, the offending traffic.

59
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,880
And this is basically what you
are doing, for your defense.

60
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,000
This is good.

61
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,860
It's really very good,
but it has some issues.

62
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:13,000
Or maybe to say that in a
different way, it is not enough.

63
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,100
There is something missing here.

64
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,890
Otherwise, we wouldn't be
in the situation we are.

65
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,199
So we are getting millions of attacks
every day from different angles.

66
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,560
It's if we were to make an analogy
with the real world, it's like having

67
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,030
millions of people hitting your
doors And your windows in your house,

68
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,240
which is something that obviously
is not something you want to have.

69
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,810
And probably because some of them may
be also to get into your house at some

70
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,230
point, because there are millions.

71
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,960
And they are doing that
every day in every second.

72
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,550
Even when you are at home, when you are
not, in the morning, in the afternoon,

73
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,210
in the evening, and when you're sleeping.

74
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,210
So basically the breach is warranted.

75
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,880
We all in cybersecurity say that is not
the question of when, but sorry, not

76
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,550
but if, but when it's going to happen,
we all know it's going to happen.

77
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:10,830
I have an anecdote related to this is
one CIO of a very large organization.

78
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:17,040
One of the statements, last statement
I read a few weeks ago was, We have

79
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,610
the enemy already inside, so we need
to make our defenses based on the

80
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,920
idea that they are already inside.

81
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:30,150
what they were saying here is that
we don't have this perimeter anyway,

82
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,230
so we need to start defending
ourselves inside the house.

83
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:39,255
Which really sounds a little bit Too much.

84
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:40,935
And legal complexities.

85
00:06:41,185 --> 00:06:46,185
Due to the nature of Internet, which
is, international, you can be attacked

86
00:06:46,195 --> 00:06:51,925
from many multiple different countries
and the legal enforcement there is very

87
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:57,305
difficult because by the time you raise
a complaint really it is very difficult

88
00:06:57,315 --> 00:07:01,625
that you hit the attackers in, in, in
the final country, in the country where

89
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,775
they are originating these attacks.

90
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:05,025
It's almost impossible.

91
00:07:05,465 --> 00:07:10,805
That's why we sometimes do see in the
news that the FBI has captured, some,

92
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:15,315
malicious attackers somewhere and they
have deactivated, thousands of boats

93
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:20,195
and stuff like that for ransomware,
for phishing, for all these attacks.

94
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,455
But the thing is still continues.

95
00:07:22,455 --> 00:07:27,255
it's Something really is not
working because this is not.

96
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,690
Only continuing, this is growing.

97
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,880
So we are in a worse situation
than we were yesterday.

98
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,360
So the trend is not good.

99
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,490
We need something else to stop this trend.

100
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:46,770
So our suggestion is that we change
something at the strategic level.

101
00:07:47,555 --> 00:07:49,835
A big change in cyber security.

102
00:07:50,555 --> 00:07:57,455
So this big change is related to the
issues related to the root cause.

103
00:07:57,955 --> 00:08:00,345
We think it is the cyber impunity.

104
00:08:01,285 --> 00:08:06,244
We think that the lack of, there is no
deterrent at the moment for attackers.

105
00:08:07,094 --> 00:08:10,414
They basically can attack at zero cost.

106
00:08:10,914 --> 00:08:11,684
they are anonymous.

107
00:08:11,684 --> 00:08:17,024
They can attack pretty much from anywhere
and they don't have any consequences.

108
00:08:17,024 --> 00:08:17,944
So it is for free.

109
00:08:18,174 --> 00:08:21,264
For example, it is a term that
is not being used that often

110
00:08:21,264 --> 00:08:25,534
these days, but in the past we
had, we had this script kiddies.

111
00:08:26,034 --> 00:08:31,274
And how is that possible that large
organizations with multiple millions

112
00:08:31,274 --> 00:08:35,604
or miles of employees, millions of
revenue, there are script kiddies

113
00:08:35,604 --> 00:08:39,614
that These large organizations and
sometimes they even penetrate these

114
00:08:40,114 --> 00:08:42,064
companies and they commit fraud.

115
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,204
So why is this happening?

116
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:47,674
Because really these attackers
are very difficult to catch.

117
00:08:47,674 --> 00:08:52,104
So it is basically, in
summary, attacking is for free.

118
00:08:52,604 --> 00:08:54,924
So the return of the
investment is very high.

119
00:08:55,424 --> 00:09:00,064
So as we say, the solution, we
think that we need a change.

120
00:09:00,114 --> 00:09:02,154
We need to think out of the box.

121
00:09:02,964 --> 00:09:10,529
The change requires A different type of
change, not only making your doors and

122
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:12,969
windows stronger, which is very good.

123
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:17,129
It's something you need to do,
but we need something else, and we

124
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:23,259
suggest Taking a strategic approach
and make our doors strong, make our

125
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:28,939
windows strong, but also enhance
the perimeter and put some distance

126
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:31,399
between the attackers and our house.

127
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:36,939
So then we can control them
from far away from where they

128
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:38,974
are and not from where we are.

129
00:09:39,474 --> 00:09:43,824
some of them probably, obviously,
will penetrate this first perimeter,

130
00:09:44,704 --> 00:09:49,614
but many of them may be filtered
because you are already, by default,

131
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,724
you're doubling the control.

132
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:56,264
So you have two controls instead
of one, and one of the controls

133
00:09:56,284 --> 00:09:57,854
is not anymore at your doors.

134
00:09:58,749 --> 00:10:00,669
It's at their doors.

135
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:02,489
It's where they are.

136
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:08,169
You get close to them, you are
moving the defenses, or doubling

137
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:10,859
the defenses, next to them.

138
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:17,609
And then the things change, because I'm
sure that all these script kiddies we have

139
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:22,719
mentioned before, they will think it twice
before attacking a large organization.

140
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:27,699
If they know that the ISP to where
they are connecting and which is

141
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:34,189
where the attack is going to be
originated is controlling them and

142
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:39,849
may raise a complaint and they could
be prosecuted because the ISP is in

143
00:10:39,849 --> 00:10:47,139
the same country they are and then can
do the prosecution of the malicious

144
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:51,639
attacker, which is something that at
the moment is not happening because of

145
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:54,309
the complexity in the international law.

146
00:10:54,809 --> 00:11:01,749
So we have two defenses, and one of the
questions that sometimes arises when

147
00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:07,119
I do this presentation is that, yeah,
okay, but We all know that the attackers

148
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:12,269
are, chaining through multiple, country
servers, before launching the attacks.

149
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:13,359
That's true.

150
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:18,759
But the same way that they chain,
we can chain it back as well.

151
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:21,709
And I'm going to explain
that in the next slide.

152
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:27,369
Once that we have introduced
what the specific technique we

153
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:30,349
suggest to enhance this perimeter.

154
00:11:30,849 --> 00:11:35,279
So the tech we suggest is the rating.

155
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:39,959
The rating is very,
extremely powerful tool.

156
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,379
Large organizations like Amazon,
eBay is an excellent example.

157
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:48,739
it wouldn't exist if that
wasn't for the rating.

158
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:54,379
Who of us would buy something in internet
without knowing who is selling that?

159
00:11:55,284 --> 00:12:01,144
Thanks to the rating, we can buy goods,
that, and we are safe that these goods,

160
00:12:01,194 --> 00:12:06,094
will, we will receive them and they
will be in relative good conditions.

161
00:12:06,474 --> 00:12:11,774
So the rating is, is an powerful,
very useful technique to use.

162
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:19,404
So then the question is why we are not
using the rating of the ISPs, that are

163
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:24,454
launching or sending this traffic of
the malicious attackers to internet.

164
00:12:25,154 --> 00:12:25,934
Because if we had.

165
00:12:26,624 --> 00:12:33,334
A rating of these ISP networks,
we could say, okay, the traffic

166
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:38,274
coming from this network is usually
malicious and the traffic coming

167
00:12:38,274 --> 00:12:40,534
from this network is usually is good.

168
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:48,594
So this would strongly support and help
the security analyst in our organizations.

169
00:12:49,094 --> 00:12:57,544
And yeah, the rating is something that
is an extremely good candidate to be

170
00:12:57,564 --> 00:13:04,354
introduced in the cyber security because
the power it has may help us, doing the

171
00:13:04,364 --> 00:13:07,124
things better in our particular case.

172
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:14,569
We do have, some intelligence of the
malicious traffic because we do have

173
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:19,029
some probes worldwide, distributed
through geographically around the world.

174
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:24,769
And we do also take some reports
from third parties on the IP

175
00:13:24,849 --> 00:13:29,809
addresses, and then we assign this,
this rating to the ISP to which.

176
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:34,334
this IP address to the ISP to
which this IP address belongs.

177
00:13:34,904 --> 00:13:37,274
And we also do have
proprietary algorithms.

178
00:13:37,774 --> 00:13:41,604
This collection of data is done
in real time and the good thing

179
00:13:41,604 --> 00:13:46,064
here is, many people, also another
key question is that, okay, yeah,

180
00:13:46,064 --> 00:13:48,384
but we already do have IP rating.

181
00:13:49,004 --> 00:13:53,614
Yeah, but the IP rating, the problem
is that there are billions of IP

182
00:13:53,614 --> 00:13:57,024
addresses and they don't have a history.

183
00:13:57,074 --> 00:13:59,848
ones that, for example, a server
with malicious, I don't know,

184
00:13:59,848 --> 00:14:04,298
phishing or whatever, or some
malware, Once that this has been

185
00:14:04,298 --> 00:14:07,108
clear, this IP address is disappears.

186
00:14:07,108 --> 00:14:12,518
we remove that from our filter list
and it is again a good IP address.

187
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:18,048
It doesn't keep a history, while in
the ISP rating we do keep this history.

188
00:14:18,048 --> 00:14:21,848
We know that today this ISP
network was behaving well.

189
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:25,988
But we also know that yesterday,
this ISP network was launching an

190
00:14:25,988 --> 00:14:30,248
attack to our, and that was detected
by our probes or by any other means.

191
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:36,748
And so we know how many times we
have rated this network and what the

192
00:14:36,748 --> 00:14:38,748
ratings were for the different, times.

193
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,038
So we keep a history of that.

194
00:14:41,108 --> 00:14:45,398
And this history is like when you go
to the restaurant, there are like, it

195
00:14:45,398 --> 00:14:49,238
is not the same to have a rating of, of
five or four to five for a restaurant.

196
00:14:49,948 --> 00:14:54,458
if there are two people that are
doing the rating for this restaurant,

197
00:14:54,978 --> 00:15:02,218
when you see a restaurant that has 1,
542 ratings and this one has a fault

198
00:15:02,218 --> 00:15:08,388
of three, it's probably a very good
rating and patent pending application.

199
00:15:08,428 --> 00:15:08,798
Yeah.

200
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:13,058
We are about to make this
application in the next few days.

201
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,388
we have this coverage
geographically, through worldwide.

202
00:15:16,888 --> 00:15:20,608
And we get this rating
is continuously updated.

203
00:15:21,108 --> 00:15:26,308
One of the key things again that I want
to mention here is that this policy

204
00:15:27,028 --> 00:15:29,848
of the rating is dictated by the AI.

205
00:15:30,438 --> 00:15:35,478
We do have a little bit human
oversight, but the policy of the

206
00:15:35,478 --> 00:15:37,218
rating is dictated by the AI.

207
00:15:37,718 --> 00:15:42,968
And you will be surprised, with the
evolution of the AIs these days,

208
00:15:43,468 --> 00:15:50,028
rational data statements look when
asking for a specific, scenarios.

209
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:56,408
So they really, really logical and
really, explained why this, rating

210
00:15:56,428 --> 00:16:00,428
should be applied based on the
scenarios we have, suggested to the AI.

211
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:02,028
That is awesome.

212
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:07,228
Some use cases, very typical is
that you use the sim here to ingest

213
00:16:07,248 --> 00:16:12,958
this cyber intelligence, into the
sim, which at the moment, we have

214
00:16:13,178 --> 00:16:18,628
a straightforward integration with
Microsoft Sentinel for which you don't

215
00:16:18,638 --> 00:16:20,518
need to change your ingestion layer.

216
00:16:21,018 --> 00:16:25,308
so this is the most typical scenario,
monitoring the traffic, but there

217
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:29,418
are some other customers that
they do, have, more sophisticated

218
00:16:29,418 --> 00:16:34,138
or they do have, a different,
sorry, a different risk appetite.

219
00:16:34,638 --> 00:16:38,148
And they do, for example,
financial entities, they can

220
00:16:38,148 --> 00:16:39,798
do, limit the operations.

221
00:16:39,818 --> 00:16:44,428
For example, they may only allow you to
see the balance of your account if you are

222
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:50,688
connecting from an ISP with a poor rating,
or they may just limit the transfer of

223
00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:55,475
the money, if that is, this connection is
coming from one of those, ISP networks.

224
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:59,805
and the risk assessment, for example,
when you get, Customers or employees

225
00:16:59,845 --> 00:17:03,605
connecting to your network, you can
make a profile and look at, how many

226
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:08,075
of them are connecting from, from ISPs
with a good rating or a poor rating,

227
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,865
and then you can make a profile on them.

228
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:10,880
Yeah.

229
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:17,000
What risk is your organization having
based on allowing some poor ISPs

230
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,520
and make decisions based on that.

231
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,790
So this is what basically the
intelligence obviously allows you,

232
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,480
the intelligence we provide to you.

233
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,310
One of the things also to maybe
mention here before going to the next

234
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:33,490
slide is that we do rate the origin
ISPs, we are in touch with them, we

235
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,590
have a strong relationship with them,
contact and a community with the ISPs.

236
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,850
So we do not only do the
rating in a cold way.

237
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:49,170
We do support the ISPs and try to
all these ISPs that don't have,

238
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,770
very good or these networks that
they don't have very good rating, we

239
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,810
support them improving the rating.

240
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,750
And this is very important because
we are here to, our mission is to

241
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:05,030
make Internet more secure, make
this second Internet, the evolution

242
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,450
of Internet, where we can be safe.

243
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:12,360
And the reason, and again, sorry for
extending a little bit, but the reason

244
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:18,570
is that sometimes we are not Aware of
how far internet is getting into our

245
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:24,790
lives and I have a little bit of a
dramatic anecdote regarding to this.

246
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:34,440
I'm living in the UK and a few months ago,
I am a blood donor and receive, An email

247
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:39,380
from NHS asking for blood, additional
blood, because they were running out of

248
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,960
stock due to a kind of a perfect storm.

249
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,730
And one of the, one of the key
components of this perfect storm

250
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,840
was that the NHS was under attack.

251
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,490
They were being cyber attacked.

252
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:57,350
So what I'm saying is that this is not
anymore about computers, about electrons,

253
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:02,140
about circuits, about electricity,
about all these things that we do love.

254
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,130
it is going much deeper is, the
impact in our lives of cyber

255
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,990
attacks is getting bigger.

256
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,830
And the way the digital, obviously
the world is going to the digital

257
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:19,210
direction, it's gonna get worse if
we don't take strategic measures.

258
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,480
As soon as possible, that's
why we are in our mission.

259
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,490
We are presenting this strategic
approach here, some real world analogies.

260
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,300
Okay.

261
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,540
I have mentioned already the
restaurant one, which is the one

262
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,760
that I do the most, because I
think it's very easy to understand.

263
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:39,340
We all go to restaurants and
we buy goods or we go dining.

264
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:43,660
we look at the rating and I'm a big
fan of looking at the restaurant and

265
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,740
which one has the best rating and the
comments of the people and all this stuff.

266
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,160
the football defense is another one.

267
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,780
we all like, many of us do like
football, not necessarily and not a

268
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:59,420
super big fan, but I do like to see my
team playing and doing a good defense.

269
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,740
And I couldn't imagine my team, like with
all the 11 players, like in the goal.

270
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:09,610
Score, they all waiting for the attackers
to just, to wait until they score.

271
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:10,960
It doesn't make sense.

272
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,045
So we all will be asking, that, for
example, we use a 4 4 2 strategy or

273
00:20:17,045 --> 00:20:21,795
something, some layered security, in
place, not all the players in the score.

274
00:20:21,795 --> 00:20:24,880
So basically that's what we are doing
in our organizations at the moment.

275
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,340
We are allowing, ISP networks
to send traffic to us.

276
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,300
and with a very poor rating and that
is the same as football or it is in

277
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,350
the restaurant and the home security.

278
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,330
I have already mentioned that.

279
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,170
all the solutions which are very good.

280
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,480
Don't get me wrong.

281
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,330
They are very good.

282
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,380
These old tactical security
cyber security solutions.

283
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,930
But we need to go one step further.

284
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,710
We need to do a strategic change.

285
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,270
We need to think out of the box for
cybersecurity solutions, or this race,

286
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:59,110
we are not going to win it at the
trend, at the speed direction is taking.

287
00:20:59,400 --> 00:20:59,710
Okay.

288
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:06,540
So let's make our windows and doors
strong, but also let's put some space

289
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:12,380
between the attackers and ourselves
and let's get us into their territory.

290
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:18,030
to be next to them and protect ourselves
better before they hit our house.

291
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,980
I know that you cannot make any
questions here, so this slide

292
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,630
probably doesn't make much sense.

293
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:30,010
but just to let you know that if, even
if you cannot do the questions now, we

294
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,140
are happy to answer you any questions.

295
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,240
So for that, you just need
to contact us in internet2.

296
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,770
ai, easy to find in the website.

297
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,850
you have the contact details.

298
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:43,080
we are in Twitter, in, in
email, obviously, and we

299
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,210
have the website as well.

300
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,970
And we do have a tool that you can
check in our website to, to look at

301
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,950
the rating of the different networks.

302
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,120
And it is for free.

303
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,400
We also do have free plans and blah, blah.

304
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,070
We haven't discussed the commercials here.

305
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,085
But if you're interested, we are happy to.

306
00:21:58,245 --> 00:22:02,225
Here is what was more the introduction
of a new strategic approach

307
00:22:02,285 --> 00:22:06,255
in order to make internet more
secure for the best of all of us.

308
00:22:07,165 --> 00:22:09,335
So thank you very much for
attending the presentation.

309
00:22:09,345 --> 00:22:10,625
That was for me a pleasure.

310
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,035
Thank you very much also
conference 42 for letting me

311
00:22:13,205 --> 00:22:15,105
presenting this innovation here.

312
00:22:15,255 --> 00:22:17,065
And yeah, have a good day.

313
00:22:17,225 --> 00:22:17,515
Thank you.
