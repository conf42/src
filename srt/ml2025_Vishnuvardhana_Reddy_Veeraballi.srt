00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,710
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,940
Welcome to Con 42, mission Learning 2025.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,260
I am Vishnu

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:09,840
Today.

5
00:00:10,299 --> 00:00:14,589
Today I'm discussing about quantum
computing encryption trends

6
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:19,150
in cybersecurity as quantum
computing advances traditional

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:25,455
encryption methods like RSA and
ECC facing unpredicted challenges.

8
00:00:27,384 --> 00:00:28,695
This presentation.

9
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:33,165
Explore how the cybersecurity
landscape is evolving to address

10
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:38,205
quantum thread, focusing on quantum
safe encryption methods that

11
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,005
will protect our digital future.

12
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:45,915
We will examine vulnerabilities
in current systems, explore forced

13
00:00:45,915 --> 00:00:47,895
quantum cryptography approaches.

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,220
And discuss how organizations are
preparing for all where quantum

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,080
computers would break encryption.

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,570
The quantum thread to
traditional encryption.

17
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,760
Yeah, traditional encryption.

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,809
Mainly we are using.

19
00:01:03,184 --> 00:01:06,295
R, SA and ECC RSA and ECC.

20
00:01:06,295 --> 00:01:10,490
Vulnerabilities like the current
encryption system depends on mathematical

21
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:16,460
challenges that classical computers
find unstoppable, but quantum computers

22
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:22,610
can potentially solve this relatively
easy mathematical foundation.

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:22,940
Yep.

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,530
Current traditional encryption, RSA.

25
00:01:26,365 --> 00:01:30,970
Depends on computational difficulty
of factoring large prime products.

26
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,680
While ECC protection lays on the
complexity of solving discrete

27
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:43,180
algorithms within elliptical curves
source algorithm, this groundbreaking

28
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:49,600
quantum algorithm it breaks both RSA
and ECC encryption by solving their

29
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,520
underlining mathematical problems.

30
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,300
Exponentially faster than
any classical approach.

31
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,100
First, quantum cryptography.

32
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:05,010
PQC, it's aims to develop encryption
methods secure against both classical

33
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,990
and quantum computer attacks.

34
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,949
These approaches can implemented
on current systems, allowing

35
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:15,180
for smoother transactions as
quantum computing advances.

36
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:17,760
Yeah.

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,800
One of the method is code based
cryptography based on difficulties

38
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,800
of decoding general linear codes.

39
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:27,770
Yep.

40
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:33,276
Now it it uses error correcting codes
to create secure cryptographic systems.

41
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:38,075
It's based on difficulties of
decoding messages that have been

42
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,265
purposefully corruption with errors.

43
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:45,370
The security of the systems relates
relates on the hardness of the certain

44
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:51,615
coding theory problems like syndrome
decoding and learning parity with noise.

45
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:54,970
And next one, ASH based signatures.

46
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,930
It's leverages quantum assist
cryptographic ash functions.

47
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,445
It is a type of digital signature
scheme that utilizes as ash

48
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:09,185
functions as core component
offering forced quantum security.

49
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:13,865
These signatures are promising
alternative to traditional digital

50
00:03:13,865 --> 00:03:18,275
signatures, which are vulnerable
to attacks from quantum computers.

51
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:23,375
Hash based signatures are designed to
be secure, even in presence of quantum

52
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:29,205
computers by relaying on hardness of
hash functions rather than mathematical

53
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:31,845
problems like in factorization.

54
00:03:33,945 --> 00:03:34,125
Yeah.

55
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:37,205
One more method is lattice
based cryptography.

56
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:42,665
It relates on hard lattice
problems on quantum solving.

57
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:44,085
Lattice.

58
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:49,755
Basic cryptographic systems are a whole
class of systems based on hard questions

59
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:55,935
around spaces formed by commanding set
of vectors for to form new vectors.

60
00:03:56,655 --> 00:04:02,655
All new vectors you can form by
this combination are called lattice.

61
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:08,315
A lattice is usually usually
introduced as a 2D or 3D vectors.

62
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,660
Because you can draw pictures
that can make some institu sense.

63
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,820
In practice, the number of variables
of vectors can be arbitrary,

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,750
and for a cryptography, they
are much greater than three.

65
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,520
Your quantum decision security
is a desire to withstand both

66
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,415
classical and quantum attacks.

67
00:04:31,415 --> 00:04:35,295
Yeah, first quantum cryptography
advantages and challenges.

68
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:40,885
Some advantages are it's a
robust protection against

69
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:43,015
future quantum quantum threats.

70
00:04:43,585 --> 00:04:49,375
Seamless integration with existing
classical computing infrastructure was

71
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:53,575
still cryptographic approaches tailored
to specific security requirements.

72
00:04:54,055 --> 00:04:58,315
Yeah, it's a continuous innovation through
extension, economic and industry research.

73
00:04:58,975 --> 00:04:59,215
Yeah.

74
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:04,805
Now you forced to quantum cryptography
will have some challenges significantly.

75
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:08,135
It's increases processing
power and memory requirements.

76
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,880
Expanded key sizes leading to potential
bandwidth and storage constraints.

77
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:19,940
Necessity for rigorous ongoing crypto
analysis to verify quantum resistance,

78
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,950
complex standardization process and
organizational adoption barriers

79
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,870
co comparing traditional versus
forced quantum approaches.

80
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,595
Yeah in security aspect.

81
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:37,595
Traditional cryptography mainly
depends on mathematical problems like

82
00:05:37,595 --> 00:05:40,325
factoring and discrete aga algorithms.

83
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:42,885
First, quantum cryptography.

84
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:45,495
You say quantum resist problems.

85
00:05:46,035 --> 00:05:47,565
Lattice problem coding theory,

86
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:51,105
quantum vulnerabilities.

87
00:05:51,615 --> 00:05:57,334
Highly vulnerable to so algorithm,
solar algorithm can easily break

88
00:05:57,764 --> 00:06:00,044
traditional mathematical problems.

89
00:06:01,334 --> 00:06:06,464
First quantum cryptography, it's designed
to resist quantum attacks, efficiency.

90
00:06:06,494 --> 00:06:12,404
Generally ENT on classical
computers first content may require

91
00:06:12,404 --> 00:06:14,019
more computational resources.

92
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:22,869
Key sizes in traditional, relatively
small in first, quantum encryption

93
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:30,069
is often large, larger impacting
storage and transmission maturity.

94
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:35,049
Yet traditional RSA and ECCR
well-established extensively

95
00:06:35,049 --> 00:06:39,849
studied forced quantum cryptography
near under undergoing active

96
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:41,889
research and standardization.

97
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:46,404
Quantum key distribution.

98
00:06:48,204 --> 00:06:52,954
How we distribute quantum
keys from sender to receiver.

99
00:06:53,194 --> 00:06:59,314
Let's how analysis a sender is the
receiver unless in course random binary

100
00:06:59,314 --> 00:07:05,974
data into quantum states transmit these
photons to Bob, leveraging fundamental

101
00:07:05,974 --> 00:07:07,894
quantum mechanical properties.

102
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:11,269
Measurement and safety.

103
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:11,869
Safety.

104
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:17,569
Bob measures incoming photons using
randomly selected measurement basis.

105
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:24,019
Both parties then compare their
basis choice choices or classical

106
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:28,819
channel returning only matching
measurement to family shared key

107
00:07:31,664 --> 00:07:34,009
error de error detection and correction.

108
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:42,124
The parties analyze error rates to detect
potential error dropping, then employ

109
00:07:42,274 --> 00:07:47,884
classical error correction protocols
and privacy amplification to distill

110
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,584
final, secure, cryptographic key.

111
00:07:51,584 --> 00:07:55,334
Yeah, the system's key advantage
is that any interruption

112
00:07:55,364 --> 00:07:57,084
attempt, attempted disturbs.

113
00:07:57,084 --> 00:08:02,914
The quantum states making is immediately
detectable through increase error rate.

Vulnerabilities to side channel
attacks and classical components.

123
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,110
Integration difficulties with
existing network infrastructure.

124
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,650
Scaling issues for widespread deployment,

125
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,420
needs standardization efforts.

126
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,510
Needs to launch first quantum cryptography
standardization process on 2016.

127
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,460
It is calling for algorithm proposal
from the global cryptographic

128
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,176
community from 2017 to 2022.

129
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:22,540
N did rigorous evaluation and public
cru scrutiny narrowed down to candidates

130
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,229

Yeah.

148
00:10:29,704 --> 00:10:34,504
In integrating quantum resist
algorithms with existing infrastructure

149
00:10:34,504 --> 00:10:36,154
