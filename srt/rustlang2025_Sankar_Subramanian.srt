00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,510
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,470
I'm Sankar Subramanian and
I'm glad we can come together

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,090
online to explore today's topic.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,040
I have over 20 years of experience
in control and automation systems,

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,970
bringing together hardware and software
expertise in area such as semiconductor

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,590
lasers, fiber optic transfers, and
electric vehicle RMD and manufacturing.

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,970
My work has often been about
integrating precise engineering with

8
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,950
intelligent, reliable automation.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,230
Over past few years, I've been deeply
involved in exploring how modern AI can

10
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,910
be combined with robust programming tools
to solve real world industrial challenges.

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,430
Rust, with its focus on safety, speed
and concurrency, has quickly become

12
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,340
a powerful choice of building high
performance and reliable systems.

13
00:00:50,245 --> 00:00:56,245
In the system, we will be looking look
at how AI powered Mission, mission in

14
00:00:56,245 --> 00:01:02,125
Rust can deliver not only accuracy and
efficiency, but also the scalability

15
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:05,635
and suitability making it strong
option for next generation automation.

16
00:01:06,415 --> 00:01:11,335
For next few minutes, I will share
key concepts, real world examples, key

17
00:01:11,335 --> 00:01:15,745
takeaways you can apply to your own work.

18
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,770
Let's get started.

19
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:29,414
AI power mission interest, transforming
ev, manufacturing quality and automation.

20
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:42,535
The imperative of advanced division
system in EV manufacturing, electrical.

21
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:46,939
Electric vehicle represents a
fundamental shift in automotive design

22
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:52,729
on manufacturing complexity due to
its higher component density requiring

23
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:57,239
multi micron level precision critical
battery safety concerns and necessary

24
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,089
a hundred percentage inspection.

25
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,064
Manufacturing at scale demands foster
throughput, zero defect expectations

26
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:06,784
for safety critical systems.

27
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,510
So all this, because of all this
high demands in the manufacturing

28
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,979
traditional inspection methods
can't meet these demands.

29
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:20,599
Creating perfect application for
rust power automation mission systems

30
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:23,959
that combines performance with
the memory safety guarantees that

31
00:02:27,054 --> 00:02:31,434
why rest the characters
that are mentioned above.

32
00:02:32,354 --> 00:02:37,274
Makes arrest uniquely suited for EV
manufacturing where reliability, speed

33
00:02:37,274 --> 00:02:39,284
and safety cannot be compromised.

34
00:02:39,764 --> 00:02:43,874
The first characteristics you know,
that we can consider is memory

35
00:02:43,904 --> 00:02:48,644
safety, zero memory related crash in
a production system through compile

36
00:02:48,644 --> 00:02:54,074
time guarantees critical for 20 4K
seven manufacturing environments where

37
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:56,124
downtime cost thousands per minute.

38
00:02:57,174 --> 00:02:59,284
Fearless currencies, safety process model.

39
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,799
Safely processing multiple camera
feeds simultaneously without, data

40
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:06,855
race a race conditioning without
any race conditioning, enabling

41
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:12,195
real time inspection across multiple
assembly stages and rest performing

42
00:03:12,284 --> 00:03:13,160
performance is very close to c.

43
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:17,309
Speeds with the zero cost abstraction.

44
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:19,850
Allow processing of higher
resolution images at the line

45
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:25,179
speed exceeding 10 ports per
second throughput FFI capabilities.

46
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:29,409
Seamless integration with cc plus
vision libraries and emission learning

47
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:33,924
framework like 10 flow and by chart
while maintaining safety boundaries.

48
00:03:38,394 --> 00:03:42,414
The real time inline quality inspection
systems, the higher resolution

49
00:03:42,414 --> 00:03:46,724
component inspection that is quite
often in the manufacturing environment.

50
00:03:47,264 --> 00:03:50,804
So Rust Vision System currently
deployed in production, environmental

51
00:03:50,804 --> 00:03:56,509
use, rust resolution down to five
micron for critical cell inspections.

52
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:02,589
Processing speed of 12 to 15 frames per
second at a 4K resolution, arrow camera,

53
00:04:02,589 --> 00:04:09,899
image resolution multi spectrum imaging,
like visible ir UV for comprehensive

54
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:14,384
defect detections, consistent performance
under variable lighting conditions.

55
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:17,269
These are all becoming, very essential.

56
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,749
And our multi-camera array leverage rust.

57
00:04:20,454 --> 00:04:24,984
That's concurrent con, concurrency model
to process multiple inspection angle

58
00:04:24,984 --> 00:04:26,905
simultaneously without frame drops.

59
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:34,374
The next presentation is next slide,
which is AI enhanced to defect detection

60
00:04:34,594 --> 00:04:37,945
which is part of the inspection
systems, mission, vision, inspection

61
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,685
systems, and in the EV manufacturing.

62
00:04:40,825 --> 00:04:43,735
So image acquisition,
which is a primary part.

63
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,330
That has high speed camera capture
capturing multiple views of components

64
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,840
at line speed, like approximately
like a 10 plus parts per second,

65
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,610
which is significantly higher
rate in the modern manufacturing.

66
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:01,120
Pre-processing rus, SAMD optimization
enables a realtime noise reduction

67
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,989
in our contrast enhancements
and then feature extractions.

68
00:05:06,155 --> 00:05:11,744
AI based classification, custom neural
network detects subtle defect missed

69
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,534
by traditional threshold based systems.

70
00:05:15,884 --> 00:05:21,104
And then automated responses, part
rejection rework, flow flagging,

71
00:05:21,104 --> 00:05:24,344
or process adjustments based
on a defect classifications.

72
00:05:25,694 --> 00:05:29,414
Our system have demonstrated a
37 percentage increase in defect

73
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:32,594
detection rate compared to
conventional machine vision approaches.

74
00:05:32,655 --> 00:05:37,205
While rest, safety guarantees
guarantees prevent the system crash

75
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:40,025
common in a CC plus N environments.

76
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:47,794
And the next thing is battery
cell on a pack inspection.

77
00:05:49,054 --> 00:05:53,794
On this electrode alignment verification
is one of the critical process

78
00:05:53,864 --> 00:05:55,454
in, in, in the battery assembly.

79
00:05:56,084 --> 00:05:57,434
Battery pack assembly, basically.

80
00:05:57,794 --> 00:05:59,954
So it means assembling a cell into a pack.

81
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:03,574
Submillimeter precision measurements
or demand in this process.

82
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:09,040
For aligning for ano catho alignment
using structured light patterns.

83
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,850
And rust high performance
image processing is vital here.

84
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,439
Surface defect detection, all
a models identify microscopic

85
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:20,330
cracks, dents, and contaminations.

86
00:06:20,705 --> 00:06:25,585
That could lead to a thermal runaway
events detecting such, such a defect

87
00:06:25,775 --> 00:06:31,125
or critical in the battery cell and
pack inspections electrolyte filling

88
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:36,255
verification, and I are imaging
combining combined with the custom d,

89
00:06:36,475 --> 00:06:40,975
detection algorithm, ensuring proper
electrolyte levels and distributions.

90
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,120
Thermal anomaly monitoring.

91
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,630
On the back level.

92
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,789
The IR cameras like FLIR,
which is a teledyne.

93
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:52,289
Now the IR camera integrates for
early detection of hotspots during

94
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:55,979
formation cycling with rust,
handling a real time thermal mapping,

95
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,880
advanced inspection methodologies.

96
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:05,830
Battery module level inspection is one of
the critical process in the manufacturing.

97
00:07:06,549 --> 00:07:11,319
Our rust based system implementation
implements several cutting edge techniques

98
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:16,619
like wire bond quality assessments
using structured elimination laser

99
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:20,424
weld quality verification through
structural analysis, thermal imaging.

100
00:07:21,284 --> 00:07:26,294
During module pulsing to identify
resistance anomalies on the welding

101
00:07:26,294 --> 00:07:31,884
defects 3D profile mapping to verify
dimensional accuracy post assembly.

102
00:07:32,814 --> 00:07:37,494
So Russ performance enable a realtime
processing of these complex inspections

103
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:39,495
routines without dropping a frame.

104
00:07:40,665 --> 00:07:44,655
Lesser build inspection requires a precise
lighting under multiple specialized

105
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,020
camera to identify microscopic defects.

106
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,359
3D mission systems for
assembly automation.

107
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,649
When it comes for assembly automation.

108
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:02,910
The challenges are quite significant,
especially how precisely we are

109
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,190
able to detect the depth of multiple
components in a 3D perspective,

110
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,785
which plays a vital role.

111
00:08:09,665 --> 00:08:15,115
So depth sensing, time of flight cameras
provides realtime spatial data for robot

112
00:08:15,115 --> 00:08:17,905
guidance with two millimeter accuracy.

113
00:08:18,785 --> 00:08:22,349
And then the other type could
be a dual camera setup with rust

114
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,670
optimized disparity mapping for high
precision and component handling.

115
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,869
We do use laser triangulation.

116
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,594
Basically a laser based sensors that,
that could measure up to sub micron

117
00:08:34,594 --> 00:08:38,734
precision for critical alignment
tasks like, motor, straighter

118
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,574
assembly, those kind of processes.

119
00:08:41,234 --> 00:08:44,834
And then point cloud processing
rust performance enables a realtime

120
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:49,874
processing of dense point clouds
for complex assembly operations.

121
00:08:53,919 --> 00:09:00,469
So once the assembly and then is
done, the AI power division analytics,

122
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,860
that plays a vital role in in any.

123
00:09:03,415 --> 00:09:05,355
High advanced manufacturing environment.

124
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:09,985
Deep planning, integration, I know
with our rust system it leverages

125
00:09:09,985 --> 00:09:15,365
multiple AI approaches for neural
networks for defect classification

126
00:09:15,545 --> 00:09:20,195
with a very high accuracy, close to a
hundred percent unsupervised anomaly

127
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:26,045
detection, identifying novel defect types,
transfer learning techniques to reduce

128
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:29,165
training data requirements by 80% age.

129
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:34,085
Russ FFI capabilities seamlessly
connecting to TensorFlow and

130
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:38,255
then OnX runtime interference.

131
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:43,835
Optimizing through Russ enables
the deployment of H devices

132
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:46,655
directly on the protection line,
eliminating network latencies.

133
00:09:51,665 --> 00:09:55,500
Then it comes to manufacturing
execution systems integration.

134
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,160
In MES in the manufacturing environment,
component traceability is one

135
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,795
of the, prime role of having ME.

136
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:09,550
So OCR and the barcode reading are
the primary on the critical process

137
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,650
of traceability implementation.

138
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,650
So OCR and barcode reading capability
tracks every component from raw material

139
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:20,400
to finished vehicles with 99 percentage
or even close to a hundred percentage.

140
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:20,730
Read.

141
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,290
Process verification.

142
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,860
So vision system confirms the correct
assembly sequences and component

143
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,220
placements, and on a day and integrate
with the digital work instructions.

144
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,950
So every critical process was implemented
with this vision based assembly

145
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,830
sequence, verifications process step.

146
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,530
So quality data aggregation.

147
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,520
All this data, there's a tons of
data that are being collected.

148
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:49,060
All these data are getting aggregated
into a one digital form and then that

149
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,530
will be tagged to every component that
is being manufactured in this line.

150
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,540
Regulatory compliance compliances.

151
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,830
It also helps to automate
documentation generation for safety

152
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,930
and certification and recall readiness.

153
00:11:02,755 --> 00:11:03,205
Rust.

154
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:07,065
Reliability ensures these mission
critical systems maintain uptime

155
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:10,875
exceeding close to a hundred percentage
essential for maintaining production

156
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,305
flow and traceability requirements.

157
00:11:16,185 --> 00:11:20,435
So once the vehicle is assembled,
when it comes for advanced driver

158
00:11:20,745 --> 00:11:23,955
assistance system calibration
under digital twin integration.

159
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,610
You know here also it
plays a critical role.

160
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:31,880
So adults calibration involves our
advanced distribution system validates

161
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,410
precise calibration for forward facing
camera for accurate land reduction,

162
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:41,240
LIDAR sensors for comprehensive
obstacle recognition, rather units

163
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,800
for reliable distance measurement.

164
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,740
Surround view camera systems
for enhanced parking assistance.

165
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,060
Rus unparalleled.

166
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:54,450
Performance and choose complex calibration
procedures for, that can be completed

167
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:58,550
within, under 90 seconds per vehicle
in a high volume manufacturing line.

168
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,590
So digital twin integration.

169
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:05,930
So real time vision data seamlessly
integrates into factory digital twin,

170
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:10,565
facilitating productive maintenance
through insightful trend analysis.

171
00:12:11,195 --> 00:12:15,215
That tracks each of the process
equipments on the critical process line.
