1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,610
Hello everyone, and thank you for
joining my presentation on building

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,439
ML ops for autonomous mortgage.

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:11,790
I want to start by asking you to imagine
the scenario now you have found your

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,740
dream home, you made an offer, and now
you're waiting for mortgage approval.

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,509
In a traditional world, a mortgage
application goes through 40

6
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:24,990
some manual steps, and it takes
anywhere from 30 to 60 days.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,250
And all the while workflows, either
manual or digital goes between people

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,290
and within different departments.

9
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,480
But imagine if that entire process
could happen in three days, and

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,930
also with better accuracy and
compliance than the old manual system.

11
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,600
And just introduce myself.

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,440
I am na.

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,230
And I have spent the last several
years building exactly these kind

14
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,730
of systems in the mortgage industry.

15
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:58,569
Today, I want to walk you all through how
MOPS principles can transform one of the

16
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:04,150
most paper heavy and regulation intensive
industry into something that can actually

17
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,280
work for customers in the 21st century.

18
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,300
And just to provide a sense of what's at
stake, the market industry process about.

19
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:16,425
$2 trillion in loans and
just in the US alone.

20
00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:17,685
And this is an annual figure.

21
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:23,445
When you apply modern m lops to that
scale, with all the regulatory complexity

22
00:01:23,445 --> 00:01:29,235
and legacy system challenges, you
get some of the, I mean, fascinating

23
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:30,465
technical problems to solve.

24
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:35,215
More importantly, you get the
opportunity to make real difference

25
00:01:35,215 --> 00:01:39,655
in people's lives because, you know,
to be honest, buying a home shouldn't

26
00:01:39,655 --> 00:01:41,425
feel like navigating a bureaucratic.

27
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,449
You know, maze from the 1980s
and just to give you a short you

28
00:01:46,449 --> 00:01:47,960
know explanation about myself.

29
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,520
Now, to give you some context on where
I'm coming from, I've been working at the

30
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,799
intersection of AI and financial services,
and what I find most interesting is how

31
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,960
MOPS principles had to evolve, especially
when we applied them to really regulated

32
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,789
industries like mortgage learning.

33
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:07,489
Now that $8 million savings.

34
00:02:07,835 --> 00:02:11,345
I mentioned in my PowerPoint
isn't just a number on a slide.

35
00:02:11,704 --> 00:02:15,185
It actually represents thousands
of families who got approved

36
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:19,234
faster application approvals with
fewer errors and less frustration.

37
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:25,655
The generative AI chatbot we built now
handles about 60% of all customer service

38
00:02:25,655 --> 00:02:29,890
inquiries, which means human agents
can now focus on the really complex

39
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,720
cases that need genuine expertise.

40
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,960
Now, why this do special?

41
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,370
And here's what.

42
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,320
It makes mortgage ML
lops more fascinating.

43
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:44,120
From a technical perspective, traditional
ML lops assume you can move fast and

44
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,220
break things in mortgage lending.

45
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,000
Breaking things means someone might
not get a home that they've always

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,110
dreamed about, or worse, you might
even violate fair lending practices

47
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,050
and face multimillion dollars in fines.

48
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,010
So we have to get creative on how
to apply these principles safely.

49
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,430
I'd like to start by going over the
industry challenges on adopting mops.

50
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:10,619
Let me start by giving a sense of
how, just how complex traditional

51
00:03:10,619 --> 00:03:11,909
mortgage processing really is.

52
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:16,569
Like I mentioned previously,
there are 47 distinct steps from

53
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:18,129
initial application to closing.

54
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:21,294
And that's for a very
straightforward purchase loan.

55
00:03:21,564 --> 00:03:25,614
There are other file forms of loan
types that can be even more complex

56
00:03:25,614 --> 00:03:30,534
and have more distinct steps, and,
and I also want you to quickly walk

57
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:31,974
you through a real world scenario.

58
00:03:32,664 --> 00:03:35,274
Now, someone applies for a
mortgage through an online

59
00:03:35,274 --> 00:03:36,264
portal on Friday evening.

60
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:40,824
That application is going to sit in
a queue until Monday morning when

61
00:03:40,824 --> 00:03:42,564
a human processor will pick it up.

62
00:03:43,194 --> 00:03:46,764
Then they need to verify the
employment of the application.

63
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:47,124
Owner.

64
00:03:47,634 --> 00:03:51,084
Which means calling HR departments
that might not respond until Tuesday.

65
00:03:51,684 --> 00:03:54,954
They have to order an appraisal, which
gets scheduling for the following week.

66
00:03:55,464 --> 00:03:58,104
Meanwhile, the credit
report needs manual review.

67
00:03:58,134 --> 00:04:01,104
Bank statements get analyzed line
by line, and then there are dozens

68
00:04:01,104 --> 00:04:02,394
of regulatory compliance checks.

69
00:04:02,844 --> 00:04:07,494
Now, each step involves different
people, often different systems that

70
00:04:07,494 --> 00:04:10,914
don't talk to each other, which is
typical in any industry, and there

71
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:15,114
are countless opportunities for
applications to get stuck in queues

72
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:16,644
and also to fall through the stack.

73
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:18,674
Here lies the technical opportunity.

74
00:04:18,945 --> 00:04:24,015
From an MLS perspective, you are dealing
with incredibly diverse data types,

75
00:04:24,104 --> 00:04:28,704
structured data from credit bureaus or
unstructured data from documents like tax

76
00:04:28,704 --> 00:04:32,664
returns and bank statements, and real time
feeds from property valuation services.

77
00:04:32,994 --> 00:04:36,714
Now, all of this has to integrate
with mainframe systems that

78
00:04:36,714 --> 00:04:40,284
we were built when, you know,
probably in the 1970s or eighties.

79
00:04:40,784 --> 00:04:44,384
But when you apply modern MOPS
principles correctly to this problem,

80
00:04:44,444 --> 00:04:47,924
you can reduce the 30 to 60 day
processing timelines to just three

81
00:04:47,924 --> 00:04:52,374
to five days while also improving
accuracy and regulatory compliance.

82
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:56,934
That is the transformation that we are
going to talk and explore here today.

83
00:04:57,434 --> 00:05:01,609
Now I want to discuss the unique technical
challenges and regulatory hurdles.

84
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,599
You know, in building AI enabled
mops for mortgage industry scaling

85
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,310
is the first reality check.

86
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,990
When I talk about scaling in mortgage,
I'm talking about processing a hundred

87
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,460
thousand plus applications daily.

88
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,050
And this is especially during peak period
volumes like spring home buying season.

89
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:22,849
But it is not just about high volume.

90
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:26,989
It is high volume of incredibly
complex high stakes decisions.

91
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:28,309
Each application.

92
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:34,219
Might involve dozens of ML models working
together, like fraud detection, income

93
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:38,669
verification, property valuation, risk
assessment, and even compliance checking.

94
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,389
The second hurdle is the
regulatory complexity.

95
00:05:42,929 --> 00:05:48,029
Now, here's something that makes
mortgage ML ops fundamentally different

96
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:49,614
from almost any other ML domain.

97
00:05:50,114 --> 00:05:54,074
Explainability is not just to have a nice
feature, it is a legally required feature.

98
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:59,294
If we deny someone a loan, we have to be
able to provide specific, understandable

99
00:05:59,294 --> 00:06:01,274
reasons that regulators can audit.

100
00:06:01,664 --> 00:06:05,984
That means every model decision needs
to be traceable back through the entire

101
00:06:05,984 --> 00:06:07,844
data pipeline with completely lineage.

102
00:06:08,444 --> 00:06:12,274
There was a situation where I
remember one regulatory auditor when

103
00:06:12,274 --> 00:06:16,924
an examiner asked about a specific
loan decision from 18 months ago.

104
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:21,094
In traditional systems, that would
mean days of detective work going

105
00:06:21,094 --> 00:06:22,774
through log files and database records.

106
00:06:23,254 --> 00:06:27,574
With the proper lops architecture, I
could pull up the complete decision

107
00:06:27,574 --> 00:06:33,514
tree in seconds, which models were
involved, what data were used, which

108
00:06:33,514 --> 00:06:37,444
business rules were fired, and even
the exact version that we're active at

109
00:06:37,444 --> 00:06:39,304
that moment when the rule engine ran.

110
00:06:39,804 --> 00:06:44,914
Now there's also the legacy integration
reality that we all know about.

111
00:06:45,414 --> 00:06:49,224
Which is probably the most challenging
aspect of the mortgage mops.

112
00:06:49,614 --> 00:06:53,844
We have a critical loan data living
in mainframe systems from the 1980s.

113
00:06:54,174 --> 00:06:59,634
There is no TPIs, no JSN, no
microservices, just batch files

114
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:02,814
and data farm mats that literally
predate the worldwide web.

115
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:08,664
Now you end up building entire AI systems
whose primary job is to just translate

116
00:07:08,664 --> 00:07:13,674
between the modern lops pipelines
and these legacy, you know, systems.

117
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:18,189
It is like building universal
translators for computer systems that

118
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:20,289
speak completely different languages.

119
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:24,959
Traditional MOPS principles had
to evolve significantly when we

120
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,549
applied them to mortgage processing.

121
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:32,174
Now let me walk you through how each
Korea core area had to be re remanage.

122
00:07:32,674 --> 00:07:35,224
The first aspect is data governance.

123
00:07:35,674 --> 00:07:37,774
Data governance in mortgage ai.

124
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:40,369
Goes way beyond typical ML governance.

125
00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:44,359
Every piece of data that influences
a loan decision must be tracked

126
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:47,929
with completely nature, not just for
dworking, but also for legal compliance.

127
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:52,459
Now we need to know what data
was used, when it was collected,

128
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:57,499
how it pro processed who had
to access it, and how all these

129
00:07:57,499 --> 00:07:59,089
contributed to the final decisions.

130
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:02,929
Now we developed something what
I call compliance first, feature

131
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:07,369
engineering, where every feature pipeline
automatically includes bias detection.

132
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:10,759
PII, anonymization and
audit trail generation.

133
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:15,649
The feature engineering code itself
generates documentation that complaints

134
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:18,949
officers can actually understand
and use in regulatory submissions.

135
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:24,829
Now, the second MO aspect is model
deployment practices and its evolution.

136
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:28,159
The model deployment looks
completely different to, we

137
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,959
cannot just optimize for accuracy.

138
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:34,729
We have to simultaneously optimize
for fairness, explainability,

139
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:36,349
and regulatory compliance.

140
00:08:37,114 --> 00:08:41,434
The training pipelines include automated
fairness, validation across different

141
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:46,084
demographic groups, bias detection
and explainability report generation.

142
00:08:46,645 --> 00:08:52,525
We develop something we call a regulatory
aware cross validation architecture where

143
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:57,205
our validation sets our specifically
constructed to test model performance

144
00:08:57,565 --> 00:08:59,755
across different demographic groups.

145
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:05,110
Geographic regions and market conditions
to ensure we are not annoyingly

146
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,300
creating discriminatory outcomes.

147
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,630
The other aspect is deployment
becomes complex, especially

148
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:16,680
because mortgage applications can
take 30 to 60 days to process.

149
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,730
If we deploy a problematic model,
we might not discover the issues

150
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,275
until weeks later when loan starts
performing poorly in the real world.

151
00:09:24,915 --> 00:09:29,235
That's why we developed extended
shadow mode testing where new run

152
00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:34,245
models run in parallel with production
models for complete loan life cycles.

153
00:09:34,515 --> 00:09:37,695
Even before we considered switching
the traffic to these new models

154
00:09:38,165 --> 00:09:42,155
we are essentially running dual
processing pipelines to validate

155
00:09:42,335 --> 00:09:46,625
behavior over long timeframes and
also for end-to-end applications.

156
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,615
I want to discuss next
on the key components.

157
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,200
And challenges in building AI
driven mortgage data pipelines.

158
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,340
I wanna start with
complexities in data injection.

159
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,830
Now let me paint a picture of
what data injection looks like.

160
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:06,000
In mortgage ai, you are dealing with
PDFs that might be scanned at weird

161
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,770
angles bank statement with hundreds of
different formats depending on the bank.

162
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,300
Now, pay stubs may come from different
companies that all format them very

163
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,880
differently, and this complexity.

164
00:10:18,195 --> 00:10:21,165
That I'm talking about is just
on the document processing side.

165
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:27,375
Then you have real time data feeds
from credit bureaus, property valuation

166
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:33,045
services and employment verification
systems, each with their own API quirks

167
00:10:33,285 --> 00:10:35,625
rate limits and vocational outages.

168
00:10:36,255 --> 00:10:41,595
During PC periods, we might be making
about 50,000 to a hundred thousand

169
00:10:41,595 --> 00:10:46,455
API calls per our personal systems,
and each service has different.

170
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,020
Reliability characteristics
and failure modes.

171
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,240
Now these are not even our
biggest challenges yet.

172
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:56,130
Our document processing pipeline
is probably one of the most

173
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,660
complex parts of the entire system.

174
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,370
We use a, an ensemble OCR model,
la think of it as a combination

175
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,720
of different OCR models because
no single OCR model can handle all

176
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,580
different document types effectively.

177
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,870
Then we have named identity recognition
models that are specifically

178
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,250
trained for financial documents.

179
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,230
They understand the difference between
gross income and net income, and they

180
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,490
can also identify debt obligations
versus assets, recognize different types

181
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,230
of employment documentations as well.

182
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,850
But this is where it
really gets interesting.

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,670
From an ML ops perspective, we have
to maintain separate discrete model

184
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,500
versions for different documents.

185
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:39,670
Pay stubs from 2020 may look
different from one in 2024.

186
00:11:40,224 --> 00:11:44,534
And the models need to be able
to handle both types of documents

187
00:11:44,534 --> 00:11:47,594
because people submit historical
documents as part of their

188
00:11:47,594 --> 00:11:51,244
applications to, you know, especially
to prove their credit worthiness.

189
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:56,104
Then every single piece of data
flowing through these pipelines have

190
00:11:56,104 --> 00:11:57,664
to be handled with extreme care.

191
00:11:58,364 --> 00:12:01,694
Now again, we implemented what we
call Privacy by design pipelines

192
00:12:01,784 --> 00:12:06,164
architecture, where PII gets
automatically identified and masked.

193
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:11,759
Sensitive data is encrypted, both
addressed and in transit, and every

194
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:13,709
access is logged for audit purposes.

195
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:19,409
The feature store becomes very critical
here, especially because it allows us

196
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:23,879
to pre-compute these features while
maintaining strict privacy boundaries.

197
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:29,759
The credit scoring model never
sees raw bank statements at all.

198
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:33,929
It only gets carefully engineered
financial behavior features

199
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:35,339
because it preserves privacy.

200
00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:38,474
And also it enables
providing accurate decisions.

201
00:12:39,314 --> 00:12:44,684
Now there's also the storage
reality that we all have to face.

202
00:12:45,374 --> 00:12:49,394
We maintain multiple storage tires
optimized for different use cases,

203
00:12:49,814 --> 00:12:55,244
hard storage for real-time decision
making with less than 50 millisecond

204
00:12:55,244 --> 00:12:59,774
retrieval requirements, warm storage
for model training and experimentation.

205
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:03,524
And the last one is the cold
storage for long-term regulatory.

206
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:09,599
The challenge here is to maintain
consistency across all these tires and

207
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:14,539
also ensure that we are maintaining
performance requirements training

208
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:16,759
data for mortgage AI presence.

209
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:20,119
Some, like I said, unique
and fascinating challenges.

210
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:24,769
You need historical loan performance
data to understand what makes a good

211
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:28,819
loan, but you also need to account
for changing market conditions.

212
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:33,769
Evolving regulations and demographic
fairness requirements because these

213
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:36,159
change tend to change if not frequently.

214
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:40,989
Occasionally, the data itself tells
stories about economic cycles,

215
00:13:41,229 --> 00:13:44,040
regulatory changes, and social evolution.

216
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,170
Now we generate synthetic data
strategically for such edge

217
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,939
cases and bias mitigation.

218
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,610
Now let's say for example.

219
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,390
We might not have enough historical data
for a certain demographic group or in

220
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,340
certain or specific geographic regions.

221
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:04,500
So we have to use generative models to
create realistic synthetic applications

222
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,190
that help ensure our models perform
fairly across all populations.

223
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,360
Now, this is not just
about filling data gaps.

224
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,490
Think of it as a proactively
testing model behavior in scenarios.

225
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,860
In which you haven't seen
how to handle them correctly.

226
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,740
Also, rather than building one massive
model that does everything end to end

227
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,380
you have to build specialized models for
different aspects of the loan decision.

228
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,820
Like, you know, one model for income
verification and one for fraud detection,

229
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,860
one for property valuation, and one for
compliance checking, et cetera, et cetera.

230
00:14:41,235 --> 00:14:44,825
And you have so many different workflows
in an end-to-end you know, market

231
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,445
process, application processing.

232
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:51,395
Each model is optimized for its
specific task, and they communicate

233
00:14:51,395 --> 00:14:53,105
through our event events, architecture.

234
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:57,635
This approach gives much better
explainability because we can

235
00:14:57,635 --> 00:15:01,655
trace decisions back to specific
models and its particular features.

236
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:07,505
It also makes debugging and iterative
improvements much more manageable than

237
00:15:07,505 --> 00:15:11,525
trying to tune one giant model and you
know, breaking things along the way.

238
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:16,705
Now, our validation process also goes
way beyond traditional ML validation.

239
00:15:17,515 --> 00:15:22,645
We run business KPI simulations
before any model goes to production.

240
00:15:23,035 --> 00:15:26,815
We simulate how the model would've
performed during historical market

241
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:29,575
ments, like the 2008 financial crash.

242
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:34,915
Or during the early pandemic period
of 2020, now we test fairness across

243
00:15:34,915 --> 00:15:39,235
protected demographics with static
statistical significance testing.

244
00:15:40,015 --> 00:15:45,355
One of our most important validation step
is what we call a regulatory compliance

245
00:15:45,355 --> 00:15:50,605
simulation, where we run the model against
historical data and verify that its

246
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:54,985
decisions would not only have violated
any fair lending practices, but also

247
00:15:54,985 --> 00:15:56,905
not create any discriminatory impact.

248
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:56,980
It

249
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,690
Now, deployment in mortgage industries
requires a much more conservative

250
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,530
and sophisticated approach than
any typical ML application.

251
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,990
We've developed something called
a three-phase deployment strategy

252
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:13,860
that minimizes risk while also
maintaining business continuity

253
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,030
and regulatory compliance.

254
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,610
Now the first step is shadow mode.

255
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:22,170
And shadow mode in this context isn't
just running models in parallel.

256
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,590
It's about running complete
loan processing workflows.

257
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:30,000
In parallel, newer models process
real applications, but their decision

258
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,040
is will not affect customers.

259
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,840
Human underwriters will will be there to
see both the production decision and the

260
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,370
shadow model decision, and they provide
detailed feedback on the quality and

261
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,170
reasoning of shadow model recommendations.

262
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:50,255
Now this gives us incredibly rich
validation data beyond any technical

263
00:16:50,495 --> 00:16:51,855
accuracy metrics we can see.

264
00:16:52,355 --> 00:16:56,585
Where the model's decisions would've
led to better busi business decision

265
00:16:56,585 --> 00:17:02,105
outcomes, and also for faster processing
times and improved customer satisfaction.

266
00:17:02,945 --> 00:17:07,505
The second aspect is canary
release sophistication.

267
00:17:08,015 --> 00:17:12,730
Our canary releases are much more
sophistication than typical END tests.

268
00:17:13,235 --> 00:17:15,965
We don't randomly assign
applications to different models.

269
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:21,425
We carefully select applications based on
this profile demographic characteristics.

270
00:17:21,755 --> 00:17:26,765
Loan types and geographic regions so
that we can ensure we are testing across

271
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:28,835
all the different relevant scenarios.

272
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:35,345
We also monitor KPIs in real time
because canary releases in row if

273
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,825
loan approval rates are shifting
outside expected statistical bonds.

274
00:17:39,245 --> 00:17:43,925
If processing times increase beyond
thresholds or if customer satisfaction

275
00:17:44,195 --> 00:17:49,085
scores drop, we have an automated
system that can roll back these models

276
00:17:49,115 --> 00:17:50,555
within minutes to previous versions.

277
00:17:51,055 --> 00:17:53,935
Now the third aspect is
full deployment monitoring.

278
00:17:54,435 --> 00:17:59,205
Even after full deployment, we maintain
comprehensive parallel monitoring systems.

279
00:17:59,805 --> 00:18:03,555
Each model decision is logged
with complete context and we

280
00:18:03,555 --> 00:18:06,645
track both technical metrics
and long-term business outcomes.

281
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:11,625
We can correlate model confidence scores
with actual loan performance, but this

282
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,665
has will happen over months or years.

283
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,740
And later to continuously
improve our systems and validate

284
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,090
the decision making quality.

285
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:23,960
Now CICD in mortgage industry is
significantly more complex than typical

286
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,880
software deployment because you are
not just deploying code, you're also

287
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:34,340
deploying decision making systems that
affect real people's financial lives

288
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,515
and, and they also need to comply with.

289
00:18:37,145 --> 00:18:39,855
Regulatory federal you know, regulations.

290
00:18:40,355 --> 00:18:44,915
Our model registry is like a combination
of docker hub and a compliance database.

291
00:18:45,695 --> 00:18:49,055
Each model version includes not just
the trained weights and inference

292
00:18:49,055 --> 00:18:54,215
code, but, but they also contain
comprehensive fairness testing results.

293
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:58,405
They also contain regulatory compliance
documents, performance benchmarks

294
00:18:58,435 --> 00:19:01,675
across different market conditions
and detailed explanatory reports.

295
00:19:02,665 --> 00:19:07,495
Before any model can be promoted to
production, it has to pass automated

296
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:11,935
tests for, for technical performance,
bias detection, regulatory compliance,

297
00:19:11,995 --> 00:19:13,495
and business impact simulation.

298
00:19:14,115 --> 00:19:18,165
We also maintain detailed metadata
about which models are approved for

299
00:19:18,165 --> 00:19:22,500
which loan types and for geographic
regions and also for market conditions.

300
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,390
Now when it comes to comprehensive
testing, our test suits include

301
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,850
standard model test unit like.

302
00:19:29,525 --> 00:19:32,945
Data processing logic and integration
test for model serving infrastructure.

303
00:19:33,335 --> 00:19:36,245
However, they also include
mortgage specific tests that

304
00:19:36,245 --> 00:19:37,535
don't exist in other domains.

305
00:19:38,435 --> 00:19:44,915
We test model behavior during simulated
market stress scenarios, validate fair

306
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:48,995
lending compliance across demographic
groups, and also verify integration with

307
00:19:48,995 --> 00:19:50,675
all the external service we depend on.

308
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:57,005
Now one of our most valuable test
is what we call the end-to-end

309
00:19:57,005 --> 00:19:58,655
simulation loan simulation.

310
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:03,350
Where we run thousands of synthetic
loan applications through the complete

311
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:07,370
pipeline, and also validate that all
the models work together correctly,

312
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,140
and they also produce explainable
decisions, and we also make sure that

313
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,090
it meets regulatory requirements.

314
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,510
Now, we also use external configuration
management extensively because mortgage

315
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,560
regulations change frequently and
we need to adjust business rules

316
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,210
without redeploying all the models.

317
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:30,830
Our models will pull their decision
thresholds, feature weights, and

318
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,760
compliance rules, and business
logic from external configuration

319
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,560
systems and rule engines.

320
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:41,330
At runtime, this capability became very
crucial, especially during the pandemic

321
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,860
when lending criteria needed to change
almost weekly in response to economic

322
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,810
conditions and regulatory guidance.

323
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:52,150
The next slide is about orchestration and
workflow automation in mortgage envelopes.

324
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:57,310
Now, mortgage Workflow orchestration
is incredibly complex because you're

325
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:02,530
coordinating dozens of different
systems, also external services and human

326
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,750
reviewers across multiple workflows.

327
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,140
Now, these can take, like
I said, typically weeks to

328
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,400
complete, or even months.

329
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:14,440
Now, unlike typical ML pipelines
that might run for minutes or hovers.

330
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,430
These workflows have to maintain
a steady state and coordinate

331
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,410
activities over month long periods.

332
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:25,750
Now, managing state, especially across
long running workflows is very critical.

333
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:31,440
You have to use event sourcing
extensively so you can reconstruct

334
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,190
the complete history of any loan
application and at any point in time.

335
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,890
This is not just useful for debugging.

336
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:41,190
Now, it is also essential
for regulatory audits.

337
00:21:42,015 --> 00:21:46,335
Where we might need to explain
every decision made many months

338
00:21:46,335 --> 00:21:49,695
ago using data and models that
we see we have updated since

339
00:21:50,195 --> 00:21:50,765
now.

340
00:21:51,265 --> 00:21:55,615
We also use event driven architecture
extensively to manage this complexity

341
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:58,765
when a credit score gets updated
during the loan processing.

342
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,810
Now this event triggers cascading events
that cross risk models to recalculate not

343
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:09,460
just the pricing models to adjust interest
rates, but also compliance systems

344
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,590
to reverify regulatory requirements
all automatically, all in parallel,

345
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,230
and all with proper audit trails.

346
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,100
Now, the beauty of this approach
is that adding new models or

347
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,460
changing business logic does not
require modifying existing systems.

348
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,525
Everything communicates
thoroughly through well-defined.

349
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:33,500
Events now, which makes these systems
much more maintainable and adaptable.

350
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,170
Now we also integrate with dozens of
external services like credit bureaus,

351
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:42,760
property valuation services, employment
verification system title companies,

352
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,800
insurance providers, et cetera, et cetera.

353
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,420
Now each API has different a PA patterns,
and they all have different rate limits.

354
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,450
They all have different reliability
characteristics and failure models.

355
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,750
Now we build a comprehensive service mesh.

356
00:22:56,155 --> 00:23:00,055
That handles circuit braking,
retries, fail hours, and back

357
00:23:00,055 --> 00:23:01,315
pressure management automatically.

358
00:23:01,675 --> 00:23:06,945
Now, during peak periods, we, we might
hit rate limits, especially with these

359
00:23:06,945 --> 00:23:12,225
external services, so the orchestration
system should automatically cure request,

360
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:16,665
manage these back pressures and optimize
the order of operations to ensure

361
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:20,805
we don't lose the application state
or violate service liable agreement.

362
00:23:21,305 --> 00:23:26,075
Now the final you know aspect here
is intelligent automation triggers.

363
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:30,365
Now, this is needed to maintain
a sophisticated automated trigger

364
00:23:30,395 --> 00:23:34,805
for model returning now based on
performance, degradation, data, drift

365
00:23:34,895 --> 00:23:38,945
detection, or significant changes
in market conditions, because these

366
00:23:38,945 --> 00:23:40,895
triggers also include business logic.

367
00:23:41,405 --> 00:23:45,965
We don't return models during the busiest
processing periods or right before

368
00:23:45,965 --> 00:23:47,435
important regulatory reporting deadlines.

369
00:23:48,365 --> 00:23:52,145
Especially when system stability
is crucial during these periods.

370
00:23:52,645 --> 00:23:58,195
Legacy integration is probably the most
challenging and underestimated aspect of

371
00:23:58,225 --> 00:24:03,325
market mops and integrating with legacy
systems that are literally older than

372
00:24:03,385 --> 00:24:07,615
most people who are actually working
on training or building these models.

373
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:11,806
We have a very critical loan data
in mainframe systems from the 1980s.

374
00:24:12,405 --> 00:24:17,485
Now these systems process batch files
once daily or you know depending

375
00:24:17,485 --> 00:24:20,565
upon the frequency of how you
know, frequency, it is required.

376
00:24:21,315 --> 00:24:27,615
Now these use data formats that vastly
predate json format by decades and have

377
00:24:27,615 --> 00:24:32,265
zero modern a PA capabilities, but they
contain decades of loan performance

378
00:24:32,265 --> 00:24:36,425
data that's essential for training
accuracy, AC risk models accurately.

379
00:24:36,925 --> 00:24:42,355
Now we ended up building what we call
legacy translation agents, especially

380
00:24:42,955 --> 00:24:48,085
specialized AI systems, whose entire job
is to speak to just mainframe systems.

381
00:24:48,775 --> 00:24:53,275
Now they convert modern human streams
into archaic formats that mainframe

382
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:56,605
will understand and also translate
back the modern data structures.

383
00:24:56,875 --> 00:25:01,155
That is, that, that is an output of
our ML models back to mainframes.

384
00:25:01,215 --> 00:25:03,050
So they can both, both
work with each other.

385
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:07,600
Now legacy system often have
data quality issues that human

386
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,850
processors have over the years.

387
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:15,310
Learned to work around over decades
now, missing fields, inconsistent

388
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:18,440
you know, formatting, business logic
that's embedded in user interface

389
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,970
screens rather than databases.

390
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,570
Undocumented transformations
that happened years ago now.

391
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:28,070
Our ML systems had to learn to handle
all these different cooks automatically.

392
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,990
Development of the sophisticated
data quality pipelines can only

393
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,650
detect and often automatically
fix these issues is necessary.

394
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,680
When they can't fix problems
automatically, they route

395
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,580
applications to human reviewers with
very detailed explanation of what

396
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,630
exactly is needed and what is where
the attention is needed and why.

397
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,730
On the same note we cannot just
turn off legacy systems overnight.

398
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,030
They're running critical
business operations that

399
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,650
generate billions in revenue.

400
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:01,120
So parallel processing validation
where both legacy system and

401
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,350
new ML systems process, the same
application simultaneously should

402
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,030
be developed and put into practice.

403
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:12,340
Now we can compare outcomes, build
confidence gradually, and shift

404
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,770
processing from legacy to ml as she
process these systems work correctly.

405
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:22,380
This approach not only gives us incredible
insight into where the legacy systems

406
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:27,150
we are making suboptimal decisions,
but it also helps us understand the

407
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,040
business value of the ML transformation.

408
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:34,370
Now from an ML ops perspective,
legacy integration requires building

409
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:38,660
sophisticated data abstraction
layers, building modern APIs that

410
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:43,070
provide consistent interfaces
regardless of whether data is coming

411
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,720
from a cutting edge microservice.

412
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,090
Or a 40-year-old mainframe system.

413
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:52,790
Now, this abstraction allows the ML
models to focus on making good decisions

414
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:57,430
rather than dealing with all the
complexity of data source integrations.

415
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:02,190
Compliance isn't just a you know
in mortgage, it's not just going

416
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:05,880
to be an optional factor or
something that you can add later.

417
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:09,210
It is going to be the
foundational architecture that.

418
00:27:09,615 --> 00:27:11,795
Everything that you
build is going to be on.

419
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:17,525
Every model decision has to be explainable
in terms that human, underwriters,

420
00:27:17,585 --> 00:27:21,305
customers, and especially federal
regulators, can understand and validate.

421
00:27:22,145 --> 00:27:25,225
Now, one has to build, sorry.

422
00:27:25,285 --> 00:27:30,805
Now one has to build automated
ity generation directly into

423
00:27:30,805 --> 00:27:32,005
every model in the pipeline.

424
00:27:32,515 --> 00:27:37,285
Now, when a MA model makes a decision,
it automatically generates explanations.

425
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:42,960
That include which features were most
important and how those features were

426
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,910
calculated now, what data sources
were used in those calculations,

427
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,990
and also how the decision aligns
with the regulatory requirements.

428
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:55,970
Now, these explanations are not just
going to be for internal debugging,

429
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,140
like I previously mentioned.

430
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,395
They're used in actual
adverse action notices.

431
00:28:01,325 --> 00:28:04,715
That get sent to loan applicants
when applications are denied.

432
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:09,365
Now these explanations have to
be accurate, understandable, and

433
00:28:09,365 --> 00:28:11,405
especially legally compliant.

434
00:28:11,905 --> 00:28:16,555
A continuous bias monitoring system should
also be running across all demographic

435
00:28:16,555 --> 00:28:18,745
groups and protected characteristics.

436
00:28:19,435 --> 00:28:24,595
These models are trained to optimize
for both accuracy and fairness

437
00:28:25,285 --> 00:28:28,945
simultaneously using specialized loss
functions and constraint optimization.

438
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:34,570
If we detect bias emerging in certain
model decisions, now we can trace it

439
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:40,120
back to specific features, training,
data issues, and or model architecture

440
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,070
problems and fix them systematically.

441
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:48,130
Now, this is not only about being ethical,
even though it is obviously important.

442
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:54,770
It is also about avoiding a multimillion
dollar regulatory fines and also to

443
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:59,500
which is in, in turn, re required for
maintaining our license to operate

444
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,330
in this heavily regulated industries.

445
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:06,930
Also, the next aspect, security
and mortgage lops means protecting

446
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:09,900
some of the most sensitive
personal information that exists.

447
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:13,750
It may be income, it may be the
customer's income or their assets.

448
00:29:14,275 --> 00:29:17,815
Or the credit history or the
employment details, so on and so forth.

449
00:29:18,355 --> 00:29:22,645
Now, the practice of end-to-end
encryption, the zero trust networking

450
00:29:22,645 --> 00:29:27,025
and principle of least privilege access
controls throughout the entire system.

451
00:29:27,025 --> 00:29:29,125
Architecture needs to be used from dma.

452
00:29:29,725 --> 00:29:33,175
Now, every model interaction is
logged for audit purposes, but the

453
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:36,625
logs themselves are encrypted and
also should be access controlled.

454
00:29:37,045 --> 00:29:41,845
We can prove to regulators that we
track who accessed what data and when.

455
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,180
But we can also demonstrate that
sensitive information was never

456
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:51,610
exposed inappropriately and shared
only in situations where required and

457
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,920
to the right you know, stakeholders.

458
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,050
We also automated as much compliance
reporting as possible because

459
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:00,980
manual compliance processes don't
scale with volume of decisions

460
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,480
these systems are going to make.

461
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:06,045
Now our systems generate
regulatory reports automatically.

462
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:12,290
They track fair lending metrics in real
time or where or near real time, and

463
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:16,760
alert us immediately if any metrics
drift outside acceptable ranges defined

464
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,920
by our internal regulatory guidance.

465
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:23,290
Next I want to talk about how can
we implement efficient strategies

466
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:28,005
to meet the performance demands,
performance requirements in mortgage.

467
00:30:28,615 --> 00:30:32,665
Industry are driven by both customer
expectations and business economics.

468
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:37,735
Customers expect instant prequalification
decisions when they're shopping for

469
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:42,415
homes, but comprehensive underwriting
needs to balance both speed and

470
00:30:42,415 --> 00:30:46,135
accuracy because the financial
stakes and logistics are very high.

471
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:47,335
Now.

472
00:30:47,335 --> 00:30:51,265
The use of model quantization
and pruning helps reduce latency

473
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:52,555
without sacrificing accuracy.

474
00:30:53,035 --> 00:30:57,205
However, implementing intelligent
caching for frequently accessed

475
00:30:57,205 --> 00:31:00,025
features and common application
patterns is very crucial.

476
00:31:01,015 --> 00:31:06,565
Using predictive free predictive
prefetching where we anticipate what

477
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:10,885
data and features will be needed based on
the current application characteristics.

478
00:31:11,185 --> 00:31:14,440
Now, during peak periods, like the
spring home buying season, which

479
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,845
I mentioned previously, we might
process three times the normal

480
00:31:18,115 --> 00:31:21,055
volumes, our auto-scaling policies.

481
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:26,980
Monitor queue depth, processing time,
resource utilization, and also external

482
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:31,000
service response time to automatically
spin up additional capacity to scale

483
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,890
up or scale down as and when required.

484
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,450
Now we also optimize cost by
using different infrastructure

485
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,570
tiers strategically, like
real time decision models.

486
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,690
Run high performance instances
with guaranteed resources.

487
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:47,980
All the while batch processing models
use spot instances and preempt VMs.

488
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,010
We also use predict scaling based on
historical seasonal patterns to minimize

489
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:58,950
infrastructure waste, while also ensuring
performance during demand spikes.

490
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,820
Now we monitor everything from multiple
perspectives anywhere from model and

491
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:09,000
latency, percentiles, resource utilization
across the entire slack, external service

492
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,590
response times, queue, depths, and most
importantly, business KPIs like loan

493
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,330
approval rates, and customer satisfaction.

494
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:21,165
Okay, now our dashboards show technical
metrics alongside business impact metrics.

495
00:32:21,525 --> 00:32:25,725
So now we can understand the
business consequences of any

496
00:32:25,725 --> 00:32:27,135
performance issues immediately.

497
00:32:27,635 --> 00:32:33,145
Mod k GI systems can fail in ways
that they don't show up immediately.

498
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:38,015
Like other traditional application
monitoring model degradation due to

499
00:32:38,045 --> 00:32:39,680
very, very subtle market changes.

500
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:44,280
Might not become apparent until
weeks or sometimes even month later

501
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,820
when loan performance data comes in.

502
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:52,080
Now, a bias issue might only surface
when you analyze approval patterns

503
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:57,900
across demographic groups over time
now using statistical drift detection

504
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:02,820
to monitor input data distribution,
but you also need to monitor business

505
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:07,440
outcome changes continuously if loan
approval rates are suddenly shifting.

506
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:12,690
Or if you see average processing
times are increasing, or if you notice

507
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:17,220
that your customer satisfaction or
dissatisfaction rates are dropping, or

508
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:22,110
if you see the agent overrides rates
are spiking then you need to investigate

509
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:26,760
immediately, even though your technical
metrics are all looking normal.

510
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,560
Now, the incident response
includes automated technical

511
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,610
rollback capabilities, not just for
infrastructure issues, but also.

512
00:33:35,135 --> 00:33:37,985
Involves human expertise
loops for business anomalies.

513
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:42,335
Now, when technical problems
occur, we have automated systems

514
00:33:42,365 --> 00:33:43,745
that can restore service quickly.

515
00:33:44,135 --> 00:33:48,745
But when business metric anomalies
occur, we have to immediately

516
00:33:48,745 --> 00:33:51,955
bring in domain experts because
they are the ones who understand

517
00:33:51,955 --> 00:33:55,595
mortgage markets and regulations,
and also customer behavior patterns.

518
00:33:56,095 --> 00:33:59,785
Now every incident becomes a
structured learning opportunity.

519
00:34:00,745 --> 00:34:02,635
You have to conduct thorough post-mortem.

520
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,890
That include both technical
root cause analysis and also

521
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,570
business impact assessments.

522
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:12,810
Now these learning will automatically
feed back into your monitoring systems

523
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:17,280
alert thresholds and also, and, and
should also eventually go into a

524
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,620
deployment procedures and, and also helps
in your model validation procedures.

525
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,010
Finally, I want to talk about.

526
00:34:25,835 --> 00:34:29,285
Future directions and key
takeaways from today's discussion.

527
00:34:29,675 --> 00:34:34,145
Now, LMS are already transforming
document processing in mortgage industry.

528
00:34:34,835 --> 00:34:39,575
Instead of training dozens of specialized
models for each document type, now

529
00:34:39,575 --> 00:34:43,475
using LMS that can understand and
extract relevant information from any

530
00:34:43,475 --> 00:34:47,725
doc financial document with minimal
additional training is the next step.

531
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:52,555
This dramatically reduces the complexity
of document processing pipeline.

532
00:34:53,055 --> 00:34:57,615
Now federated learning is becoming
an interesting concept in mortgage

533
00:34:57,615 --> 00:35:01,245
industry because it could enable
collaboration between institutions

534
00:35:01,515 --> 00:35:03,285
while maintaining strict data privacy.

535
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:08,275
Now, imagine training, you are training
a better fraud detection model using

536
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:12,805
insight from across the industry or
even your competitor now without any

537
00:35:12,805 --> 00:35:16,955
of these institution sharing sensitive
data or sensitive customer data.

538
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:22,120
Now let me leave you with you know,
couple of essential lessons from building

539
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:26,800
mop systems, especially for mortgage
industry that apply broad and not just,

540
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:31,000
sorry, not just mortgage industry,
but to any broadly regulated industry.

541
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,500
Now, the first one is regulatory
compliance is sent a constraint that you

542
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,410
should always work around from the get go.

543
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,310
It should be an architectural requirement
that you design into every component.

544
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,520
Now, trying to add compliance later is.

545
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,310
Exponentially expensive.

546
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:52,480
And it, it is sometimes an expensive and
impossible ticket to, you know complete.

547
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:56,580
Now the second one is legacy
system in integration will always

548
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,960
be more complex than you expect.

549
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,430
So plan for it.

550
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,840
You allocate significant
budget time and resources.

551
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,700
Now, you also build abstraction layers
that can evolve as you gradually

552
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,600
modernize your legacy systems
into, into, you know legacy mode.

553
00:36:13,245 --> 00:36:14,925
As you modernize your legacy systems.

554
00:36:15,645 --> 00:36:19,785
The third aspect is, you know,
business outcome monitoring is just

555
00:36:19,785 --> 00:36:22,155
as important as technical monitoring.

556
00:36:22,605 --> 00:36:27,045
Your technical metrics can look
perfect, but your business outcomes

557
00:36:27,045 --> 00:36:32,235
are quietly degrading in a ways that,
like I said, will not be apparent

558
00:36:32,535 --> 00:36:34,635
until weeks or even months later.

559
00:36:35,135 --> 00:36:38,915
And also change management and
stakeholder buy-in are absolutely crucial.

560
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:43,985
The most sophisticated ML system in
the world will fail if the people who

561
00:36:43,985 --> 00:36:48,155
need to use it don't understand it
are trusted or see the value in it.

562
00:36:48,635 --> 00:36:52,685
There has to be a mixture of both
top down and bottom up approach.

563
00:36:53,185 --> 00:36:58,525
Now, when you're getting ML ops right in
the market industry, the transformation

564
00:36:58,525 --> 00:37:00,355
is going to be dramatic and measurable.

565
00:37:00,715 --> 00:37:04,645
Now, loan processing times
will drop from weeks to days.

566
00:37:05,485 --> 00:37:07,375
Accuracy will improve significantly.

567
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:12,070
Your operational cost will decrease
substantially, and regulatory compliance

568
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,310
becomes automated and bulletproof.

569
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,510
And most importantly, the entire home
buying process will become something

570
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:25,180
customers actually enjoy rather
than enduring for weeks or months.

571
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,150
Now, the mortgage industry has been
essentially unchanging for decades, but

572
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:35,280
ML ops will give the, give us the tools
and techniques to transform it completely.

573
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:36,210
The.

574
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,270
Organizations that master this
transformation, especially the first

575
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:45,110
one, to master them will dominate
the next set of financial services.

576
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:49,900
The technology exists, the
techniques are proven, and the

577
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,460
business cases also company.

578
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,450
Now.

579
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,640
It is just a matter of execution.

580
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,380
Now, I also want to thank
you all for your time today.

581
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,025
I am excited to continue.

582
00:38:00,435 --> 00:38:04,965
I am excited to continue to have
these conversations and also help

583
00:38:04,965 --> 00:38:09,495
more organizations successfully
apply mops principles and transform

584
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,175
their industries successfully.

585
00:38:11,445 --> 00:38:15,105
Now, let's align, adapt, and accelerate
for a breakthrough transformation.

586
00:38:15,405 --> 00:38:15,855
Thank you.
