1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:00,910
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,860
welcome to this conference 42,
conference, virtual conference.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,829
good morning, good evening, to
all the folks who are attending

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,480
across various parts of the world.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,920
Today we are discussing about the
role of artificial intelligence

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,670
and enhancing the supply chain.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,260
Resilience and how we can leverage,
AI to transform supply chains to

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,520
better handle complexity, data
challenges, and disruptions.

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:30,820
About me, I'm a seasoned professional
in the technology space with

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,560
about 19 years of experience doing
technology, roadmap, development,

11
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,560
strategy, and program management.

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,730
I'm part of various projects implementing
global supply chains, three pillar

13
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:47,410
integrations, driving efficiencies
within the manufacturing, supply chain,

14
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:51,906
distribution, and logistic space, and
also leveraging artificial intelligence

15
00:00:51,906 --> 00:00:56,500
wherever possible and applicable within
the life sciences industry, retail

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,200
industry, consumer goods industry.

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,160
Yeah, let's talk about the
complexity of the data, right?

18
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,610
in today's world, modern supply
chain, there are so many data

19
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,640
points which we need to manage.

20
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,930
If you take an example of any
manufacturing industry or distribution

21
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:16,900
industry, in order to do your forecasting,
you need to have several data points

22
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,000
within these interconnected systems.

23
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,140
The way the traditional systems
connect is basically have one set

24
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,810
of data or multiple set of data.

25
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:30,180
But then, in order to really drive the
forecast, you need to have all your item

26
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,320
related data, location related data,
time related data, point of sale data.

27
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,930
There are variety of datas which you
need to gather, the complexity and

28
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,940
the data overload has really become.

29
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,060
enormous today, right?

30
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,130
Not just that.

31
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,100
if you really talk about the global
disruptions, for example, the COVID 19

32
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:56,510
has struck us in such a bad way that
we cannot just rely on shipment data in

33
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,080
order to generate your forecast, right?

34
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,460
there are so many disruptions happening
within the industry, which is causing,

35
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:08,560
the impact of about 184 million
dollars per organization, right?

36
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,110
And that is exactly where AI
is coming into the play, right?

37
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,530
AI can offer, resilience and then
bring that efficiency, operational

38
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,870
efficiency back into the game, right?

39
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:26,310
Because AI has capabilities to
quickly adapt to the needs, to the

40
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:32,200
dynamic needs, and then, manage your
time and the real time data, right?

41
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,510
that is where AI is coming and making
a pivotal role in order to leverage

42
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,620
and then improve the resilience.

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,390
Yeah, let's talk about the role of
AI in supply chain management, right?

44
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,500
agility is one of the biggest one,
stay agile in the current ecosystem,

45
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,680
staying agile in the current dynamic
needs of world is very important.

46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,100
And AI is really offering a lot of
solutions because AI has capability

47
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:03,595
to really take that data to enormous
amount of data and then, respond

48
00:03:03,605 --> 00:03:06,895
back to that market fluctuations
and then unexpected events, right?

49
00:03:06,965 --> 00:03:08,595
Agility is a big one, right?

50
00:03:09,045 --> 00:03:13,065
Cost production, but by predicting
cost fluctuations and cost related

51
00:03:13,065 --> 00:03:18,745
raw materials, storage, logistics, AI
enables proactive cost management, this

52
00:03:18,745 --> 00:03:20,205
is again connected to the data, right?

53
00:03:20,255 --> 00:03:24,365
within the supply chain, a lot of
times we procure the material from

54
00:03:24,585 --> 00:03:28,265
various parts of the world, wherever
there is a availability, abundant

55
00:03:28,265 --> 00:03:31,295
availability of the raw material,
we try to procure that material.

56
00:03:31,405 --> 00:03:35,855
Not just that, even from a distribution
and storage standpoint, we try to,

57
00:03:36,295 --> 00:03:40,465
distribute and store it in different
distribution center locations.

58
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,535
Of the same organizations, right?

59
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:46,545
It is very important for us to
maintain all the data, but at the

60
00:03:46,545 --> 00:03:50,515
same time, proactively, how we can
leverage AI to do the cost management

61
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:52,395
of that supply and optimization.

62
00:03:52,405 --> 00:03:56,335
as I said, the cost production is one
predominantly one at the same time,

63
00:03:56,555 --> 00:04:02,575
supplier optimization is, a lot of times
all these suppliers are like, rank.

64
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,280
Supplier one, supplier
two, supplier three.

65
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,130
But at the same time, the supplier
also is trying to expand their

66
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:15,220
footprint to produce as much material
as they can and then supply as much

67
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,340
material as they can to the variety
of needs across the globe, right?

68
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,860
How we can leverage AI?

69
00:04:22,165 --> 00:04:26,535
To improve the continuity and then
stability in the supply network, right?

70
00:04:26,585 --> 00:04:31,355
a lot of times there are so many
organizations who are supply constrained,

71
00:04:31,475 --> 00:04:32,965
because of variety of reasons.

72
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:36,915
And it is important to really have
resilience within the supply chain

73
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:40,845
network and then ensure that,
continuity and stability is maintained.

74
00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:45,055
I can talk a real example of my,
organization and experience, right?

75
00:04:45,565 --> 00:04:49,635
where, we are trying to produce a
product and then it is via constraint.

76
00:04:49,995 --> 00:04:52,145
Product, obviously there is a regulation.

77
00:04:52,155 --> 00:04:53,785
it's a life sciences industry.

78
00:04:53,785 --> 00:04:59,210
There is a regulation and then you
cannot just procure it from One supplier,

79
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,230
because, because of the regulation,
you have to, make the product.

80
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:08,455
And the product is approved
only for those suppliers.

81
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:12,445
So you are really constrained to
get the material only from that

82
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:15,965
supplier, which is putting back
your supply chain and risk, right?

83
00:05:16,365 --> 00:05:22,505
AI can help you streamline that to gather
all the data, do the assessment, then

84
00:05:22,505 --> 00:05:25,055
see if we can optimize our supplier.

85
00:05:25,905 --> 00:05:27,895
Supplier network, right?

86
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:29,075
And that's forecasting.

87
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:30,645
this is a big one, right?

88
00:05:30,645 --> 00:05:35,175
any point of time, in order to improve
your forecasting, some organizations are

89
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:42,065
spending millions of dollars to bring,
one point to two point efficiency in

90
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,355
their forecasting capability, right?

91
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:50,405
And demand planning is always a
challenging aspect within the supply

92
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:53,510
chain because Demands can be, so much.

93
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,360
It can be volatile.

94
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,820
It can be intermittent.

95
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,440
It can be seasonal, right?

96
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:02,540
so it is important for us to
play this card of having enhanced

97
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,080
forecasting is very important.

98
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,570
And then that happens only if
you can analyze larger data sets.

99
00:06:07,985 --> 00:06:12,455
And analyzing larger data sets
is only possible using AI, right?

100
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,205
Compliance and fraud detection.

101
00:06:14,265 --> 00:06:17,675
as I was talking in the supplier
optimization, the same thing applies here

102
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:19,805
in compliance and fraud detection, right?

103
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:25,875
you are, your supplier is certified
only to supply one kind of material.

104
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:30,065
And then it is important for us to
keep that compliance and quality

105
00:06:30,065 --> 00:06:31,615
from a regulation standpoint.

106
00:06:31,665 --> 00:06:36,235
If you don't do that, then, you might
run into a situation where, FDA or

107
00:06:36,265 --> 00:06:41,045
any auditing body is doing the audits,
and then you might end up closing your

108
00:06:41,045 --> 00:06:44,945
business, which is risk to the, to the
nation, to, to the industry, right?

109
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:48,155
So it is very important to,
keep an eye on compliance and

110
00:06:48,155 --> 00:06:49,795
fraud detection for sure, right?

111
00:06:50,185 --> 00:06:51,115
The market growth, right?

112
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:53,695
from within the global supply
chain, the projected market

113
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,585
growth is 14 billion by 2028.

114
00:06:56,085 --> 00:07:01,725
With this rapid advancement, it is
very important that We keep AI on our

115
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:06,285
radar and then leverage as much as
we can, wherever applicable, to bring

116
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:08,675
back that efficiencies into the game.

117
00:07:09,175 --> 00:07:13,135
Yeah, let's deep dive into some of
the supply chain challenges, right?

118
00:07:13,185 --> 00:07:14,615
data deluge, right?

119
00:07:15,255 --> 00:07:21,535
The global data is growing
at a rapid pace, right?

120
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:26,825
we have, I think the global data
sphere is expected to reach about, 175.

121
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,980
Serabytes by 2025, right?

122
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,380
With supply chains, just supply
chains contributing to 25

123
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,770
percent of this growth, right?

124
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,580
How do we manage the data?

125
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,940
Obviously, this is one big supply chain
challenge what we are running into, right?

126
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,910
The second supply chain challenge
what we are running into is

127
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,500
system complexity, right?

128
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:51,300
Today's supply chain often
involve about 15 20 interconnected

129
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,570
systems for functions, right?

130
00:07:54,130 --> 00:08:00,770
if you take a typical example of any
industry who, a midsize industry where

131
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:08,180
you have your core ERP, where you
are managing your inventory, where

132
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,710
you are managing your procurement
processes, where you are managing your

133
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:16,010
order management related processes, it
could be data coming from e commerce,

134
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,020
It could be data coming from EDI.

135
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,910
It could be data coming from your vendors
or suppliers or, or your customers.

136
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,940
So that's all happening in ERP.

137
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,950
And then there are a lot of
edge applications which are

138
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:32,570
connected, like your demand
planning, your supply planning.

139
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:36,940
And then the moment you get into
logistics, logistics again has its own

140
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,340
set of applications like picking systems.

141
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,490
Packing systems, conveyor systems, a
lot of applications on the logistics

142
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,910
or transportation systems, right?

143
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,830
So there is a system
complexity as well, right?

144
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:53,190
and the third one is, demand pressures and
shorter service level agreements, right?

145
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,550
So the demand pressure, obviously,
if you see today, everyone is

146
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,820
trying to stay in the business.

147
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,030
And then the competition has
increased in such a way that they

148
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:07,755
want to, deliver their product
as quickly as they can, right?

149
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:10,745
So they are expecting same day
delivery, next day delivery,

150
00:09:10,745 --> 00:09:12,255
four hours of delivery, right?

151
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:15,345
So how do we manage this
kind of data, right?

152
00:09:15,395 --> 00:09:19,275
there is so much pressure on the
organizations to manage all this

153
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:21,415
data and take timely actions, right?

154
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:25,025
And then finally the COVID impact,
the COVID impact, there's so many

155
00:09:25,025 --> 00:09:29,535
organizations which have gone,
bankrupt because of COVID 19.

156
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:33,635
and that has led into so many challenges.

157
00:09:33,645 --> 00:09:38,275
there is a resource shortages, there
is a manufacturing shortages, there

158
00:09:38,305 --> 00:09:40,985
is, a need for, resilience, right?

159
00:09:40,985 --> 00:09:44,795
but then, the impact is so much
that it takes its own time to

160
00:09:44,825 --> 00:09:46,305
come out of that impact, right?

161
00:09:46,305 --> 00:09:50,625
these are some of the typical supply
chain challenges, I think, which, Which

162
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:57,295
is creating a havoc in the supply chain
and a big hole within the supply chain.

163
00:09:57,295 --> 00:10:01,890
And, and obviously there are
opportunities in some spaces and there

164
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,400
are, challenges in some spaces, I think.

165
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,130
But overall, these are the
supply chain challenges, what

166
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,540
we have within the supply chain.

167
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,300
Okay, we have seen a variety of
challenges in the previous slide, right?

168
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,750
Let's AI can help us address
some of these challenges, right?

169
00:10:18,645 --> 00:10:20,925
Let's start from the
data management, right?

170
00:10:20,975 --> 00:10:24,615
AI can handle real time data
processing, enabling fast and

171
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,275
accurate decision making, right?

172
00:10:26,675 --> 00:10:30,995
so this is a big use case,
which is happening today.

173
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:36,045
we can take an example of, the way the
chat GPT have evolved or the way, Gen

174
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:38,345
AI has evolved, within the supply chain.

175
00:10:38,385 --> 00:10:42,025
Today, there are so many applications,
which, which are trying to.

176
00:10:42,745 --> 00:10:47,325
help supply chain with the
help of these new technologies

177
00:10:47,335 --> 00:10:48,405
which have come in, right?

178
00:10:48,405 --> 00:10:53,285
Gen AI, like for example, Gen AI
today is capable enough to give

179
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:57,455
you information about, which can,
which it can scrape the entire data

180
00:10:57,485 --> 00:10:59,705
set from various sources, right?

181
00:11:00,095 --> 00:11:04,845
And then it can tell you, saying
you are good at these items.

182
00:11:04,845 --> 00:11:08,395
You are bad at these items and then,
the data maintenance can be done.

183
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,790
within that scope, right?

184
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,480
And not just that from a DevOps
standpoint, the overall the way the

185
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,540
cloud infrastructure is built to, which
can help to do auto scaling, right?

186
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,710
and also there are the whole data
lakes, snowflakes, and then, all these

187
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,630
various systems which are available
are capable enough to really manage

188
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,280
the data from multiple sources
and then and store them and then,

189
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,270
And then consume as needed, right?

190
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,970
So data management is a big one,
which AI is addressing today, right?

191
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,090
The second one is the
system integration, right?

192
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,760
the AI is supporting, the seamless,
data flow and communication

193
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,160
across the interconnected systems.

194
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,120
And during operations
remain synchronized, right?

195
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,640
there are a lot of times, in, in a typical
core ERP world where, you take example of

196
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,950
any big player in the market today, right?

197
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,130
where you're trying to gather all the
data from one system to another system,

198
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,880
it takes about four to six hours.

199
00:12:03,425 --> 00:12:06,805
And then you run your processes
on that system, which takes

200
00:12:06,805 --> 00:12:08,545
about another four to six hours.

201
00:12:08,615 --> 00:12:09,835
and then you cleanse it.

202
00:12:09,835 --> 00:12:12,605
And then there are so many
jobs, hundreds of jobs which

203
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:13,865
are running behind the scenes.

204
00:12:13,865 --> 00:12:17,225
And then next day morning, the
system is given to the business

205
00:12:17,225 --> 00:12:19,085
user to do day-to-day operation.

206
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:24,925
Which is a big delay in the overall,
availability of the data today.

207
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:30,985
It is given in less than one hour, the
same jobs which are running today because

208
00:12:30,985 --> 00:12:35,655
they're all scaled up in such a way that
they're pretty much in the cloud, right?

209
00:12:35,705 --> 00:12:42,605
and then also the way the data
is consumed is happening more

210
00:12:42,605 --> 00:12:44,555
of targeted refreshes, right?

211
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,005
As it is all getting into the cloud.

212
00:12:46,395 --> 00:12:48,545
More of microservices model.

213
00:12:48,575 --> 00:12:53,285
So the data can be collected and
the data can be, or transmitted in

214
00:12:53,285 --> 00:12:56,105
a much more synchronized way, right?

215
00:12:56,395 --> 00:12:57,265
Predictive insights, right?

216
00:12:57,265 --> 00:13:01,475
AI, obviously, as I said in one
of the previous slides, right?

217
00:13:01,525 --> 00:13:05,165
Improving one point efficiency,
two point efficiency, right?

218
00:13:05,235 --> 00:13:08,235
Would save millions of
dollars to the organization.

219
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,756
Today, AI can help you
identify the anomalies, right?

220
00:13:12,756 --> 00:13:15,656
AI can help you identify
the data patterns, right?

221
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:19,636
It can see that you had a sale
last month, but you did had a

222
00:13:19,636 --> 00:13:22,356
sale Same time last year, right?

223
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,836
That does not mean that you will
have a sale next year, right?

224
00:13:25,876 --> 00:13:27,636
That's just one anomaly, right?

225
00:13:27,996 --> 00:13:29,986
So and then not just that right?

226
00:13:29,986 --> 00:13:35,726
I mean considering your situations within
the Demand or supply like for example,

227
00:13:35,726 --> 00:13:37,536
if we talk about safety stocks, right?

228
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:39,126
how do you plan your safety stocks?

229
00:13:39,126 --> 00:13:41,366
Are you really red green yellow, right?

230
00:13:41,716 --> 00:13:45,826
It is giving you AI is pretty
much giving you anomalies on

231
00:13:46,496 --> 00:13:49,536
where to get, which to get, right?

232
00:13:49,556 --> 00:13:53,086
And which customer to fulfill first
from an allocation standpoint.

233
00:13:53,506 --> 00:13:57,626
And then at the same time,
which distribution center

234
00:13:57,626 --> 00:13:59,816
should have this product when?

235
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:03,006
AI is giving you all
that predictive insights.

236
00:14:03,571 --> 00:14:06,771
Which is bringing back that
resilience again, right?

237
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:10,151
this is not just like one
place, kind of impact here.

238
00:14:10,511 --> 00:14:13,151
The overall supply chain
has to be impacted, right?

239
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:18,461
from the procuring of the product to the
finished good delivery to the customer.

240
00:14:18,641 --> 00:14:23,131
So AI is playing, a role right from
the data to the integration to the

241
00:14:23,151 --> 00:14:26,461
giving the insight and then building
the resilience across the supply chain.

242
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:31,691
so far we have seen a lot of, challenges,
within the supply chain and other things.

243
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:36,341
Let's dig deeper on the AI
applications within the supply

244
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:38,301
chains and how AI can, be helpful.

245
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:41,071
within the scope of the
supply chain, right?

246
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:46,651
There are a variety of, use cases there,
but I think we are planning to talk about

247
00:14:46,861 --> 00:14:53,251
five or six use cases here, functional
areas where AI can help, within these

248
00:14:53,401 --> 00:14:54,901
supply chain applications, right?

249
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:57,761
Office demand sensing is one critical one.

250
00:14:57,881 --> 00:15:05,481
Demand sensing is basically, where you're
trying to forecast your, short term, on

251
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:11,251
the product, on the, on the SKUs, which
are more of a short term in nature, right?

252
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:15,806
For the longer term and the medium
term, there are a lot of applications

253
00:15:15,836 --> 00:15:17,296
which are available in the market.

254
00:15:17,326 --> 00:15:23,366
But then for the shorter term, where
the demand is so much volatile and

255
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:29,181
so much intermittent, it becomes
really challenging to, Get to

256
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:31,371
real forecast accuracy, right?

257
00:15:31,971 --> 00:15:35,931
And then, and that is where demand
sensing is coming into play.

258
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:38,871
And that is where AI is
coming into play, right?

259
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:43,731
Where you have, where
you need capability to.

260
00:15:44,226 --> 00:15:47,646
Plan Short term like I
mean it could be a week.

261
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:50,406
It could be a month It could be
three months right within the

262
00:15:50,406 --> 00:15:51,996
demand control window, right?

263
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:58,596
So so that's where ai is coming into play
and then it is helping you to do demand

264
00:15:58,596 --> 00:16:04,116
sensing and obviously In order to do this
demand sensing, you need a lot of data

265
00:16:04,116 --> 00:16:06,846
feeds which will go into the applications.

266
00:16:06,996 --> 00:16:12,556
But then AI has capability to consume all
this information and then provide you much

267
00:16:12,576 --> 00:16:15,726
more realistic, closer forecast accuracy.

268
00:16:15,786 --> 00:16:18,046
That is where demand
sensing is coming into play.

269
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:20,166
The second one is the
cost reduction, right?

270
00:16:20,236 --> 00:16:23,992
a lot of times what happens is when
you bring a container from Asia,

271
00:16:23,992 --> 00:16:27,918
when you bring a container from,
any other parts of the world to Rest

272
00:16:27,918 --> 00:16:29,208
of the parts of the world, right?

273
00:16:29,258 --> 00:16:33,978
So there are a lot of times there is, so
much fluctuation in the logistics industry

274
00:16:34,008 --> 00:16:38,758
and then also not just fluctuation in the
logistic industry, there is fluctuation

275
00:16:38,778 --> 00:16:40,748
in the material cost as well, right?

276
00:16:41,138 --> 00:16:44,188
It is all about the supply
and demand situation, right?

277
00:16:44,188 --> 00:16:47,208
So AI has capability.

278
00:16:47,543 --> 00:16:53,353
which can help, which can help to take
all those inputs and then come back with

279
00:16:53,353 --> 00:16:59,153
a cost prediction analysis, which will
help, industries to do their planning

280
00:16:59,153 --> 00:17:01,023
and budgeting in the right way, right?

281
00:17:01,373 --> 00:17:04,473
The other one is supplier
network stabilization, right?

282
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:07,303
as I said, I think we did talk
through this in the previous slides.

283
00:17:07,803 --> 00:17:10,713
Supplier network stabilization
is a very key one, right?

284
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:14,353
there are a lot of instances where
You want to procure material only from

285
00:17:14,453 --> 00:17:19,103
a supplier or you want to, do a dual
sourcing kind of thing where you're

286
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:23,653
not putting your industry or you're not
putting your organization in risk, right?

287
00:17:23,713 --> 00:17:25,343
You need to have some mechanism.

288
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:30,583
Where you can get the material from
various suppliers as long as you meet

289
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,383
the regulation and the compliance, right?

290
00:17:32,723 --> 00:17:36,013
Fraud detection again, this is a
critical one We are living in a world

291
00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:41,393
where pretty much everyone is relying
on Internet and wherever there is access

292
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,918
to internet Risk comes into play, right?

293
00:17:43,918 --> 00:17:48,018
So it is very important to make
sure The fraud detection and cyber

294
00:17:48,018 --> 00:17:52,738
security are maintained and AI really
play a critical role in doing the

295
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,358
fraud detection as well, right?

296
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:58,128
The last one is data and the
compliance management, even

297
00:17:58,128 --> 00:17:59,648
though it's listed last year.

298
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:03,808
It is very Important that we need
to understand without data There is

299
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:07,778
nothing we can do right for a planning
function to work for a supply chain

300
00:18:07,778 --> 00:18:12,018
function to work And Master data is
the critical element in order to make

301
00:18:12,018 --> 00:18:13,928
sure the master data is all right.

302
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:16,808
There is so much
responsibility on the systems.

303
00:18:16,838 --> 00:18:20,498
There is so much responsibility
on the business users to make

304
00:18:20,498 --> 00:18:22,258
sure that data is maintained.

305
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:24,328
It is all about garbage in garbage out.

306
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:28,728
If you don't maintain your data,
all your outputs will be all, wrong.

307
00:18:28,778 --> 00:18:32,088
so it is very important to make
sure you maintain your data.

308
00:18:32,188 --> 00:18:36,358
and AI is really playing a critical role
here in maintaining the data, right?

309
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:41,998
Today, the way the industry has
revolutionized, if there is data

310
00:18:42,068 --> 00:18:46,028
disconnects, or if, if we take an
example of safety stock, right?

311
00:18:46,028 --> 00:18:51,818
if AI can take that decision or AI can
take the data point and then can give you

312
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:56,638
back a decision saying this is how the
safety stock should be configured, right?

313
00:18:56,948 --> 00:19:02,008
When you were selling this product,
last year, this much quantity, this

314
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:05,688
year, this much quantity, you probably
will sell this much quantity next year.

315
00:19:06,008 --> 00:19:10,818
So in order to maintain that much
inventory, you need to have X amount

316
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:12,388
of safety stock within your system.

317
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:15,238
And all of this is maintained
based off of the master data.

318
00:19:15,268 --> 00:19:18,148
So it is very important that
you maintain, Your master data

319
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:22,988
accurately so that all your systems
can give you relevant outputs.

320
00:19:22,988 --> 00:19:25,448
And that is where AI will
play a critical role.

321
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:30,708
So we have seen how AI can make an
impact on the supply chain, right?

322
00:19:30,718 --> 00:19:35,128
quantitatively, your forecast accuracy.

323
00:19:35,518 --> 00:19:39,728
AI powered models improve forecast
accuracy by up to 60 percent

324
00:19:40,258 --> 00:19:42,988
supporting the demand planning
function and the stock management.

325
00:19:43,568 --> 00:19:46,508
It also helps you in inventory
cost reduction, right?

326
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:51,508
with the help of the demand sensing, it
reduces your inventory cost by 20 to 30%

327
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:53,818
to having better inventory optimization.

328
00:19:54,198 --> 00:19:56,778
It also helps you in
improve decision making.

329
00:19:57,078 --> 00:20:02,988
75% or 73% of professionals report faster,
more accurate decisions due to ai, right?

330
00:20:02,988 --> 00:20:07,638
Because there is real time data, which is
getting available, so it is much easier

331
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:09,888
and quicker to make improved decisions.

332
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:13,808
And then all of this would lead
to, carrying cost reduction, right?

333
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,628
You don't need to carry too much
material in your warehouse or

334
00:20:16,658 --> 00:20:17,918
in your distribution center.

335
00:20:17,918 --> 00:20:21,528
So obviously some of these
autonomous decisions are helping

336
00:20:21,528 --> 00:20:25,148
you reduce your carrying costs.

337
00:20:25,228 --> 00:20:30,108
That means you are getting into more of
a lean supply chain model, which would

338
00:20:30,848 --> 00:20:33,828
help you reduce your carrying costs.

339
00:20:33,923 --> 00:20:38,943
So we did see the impact on the
overall supply chain, but then there

340
00:20:38,943 --> 00:20:42,813
is also impact overall on the broader
enterprise operations item in each

341
00:20:42,813 --> 00:20:47,333
organization, would have variety
of, enterprise operations, right?

342
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,033
So there is a procurement team.

343
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:49,973
There is a planning team.

344
00:20:49,973 --> 00:20:51,213
There is a military planning team.

345
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:53,663
There is an auto management
team or customer service team.

346
00:20:54,073 --> 00:20:58,093
There's a manufacturing team distribution
scene, it team cyber protection

347
00:20:58,093 --> 00:20:59,613
and then threat detection teams.

348
00:20:59,613 --> 00:21:03,713
There is a, Risk mitigation teams, a
lot of teams, operating and then within

349
00:21:03,713 --> 00:21:08,473
the ecosystem of enterprise resources
and enterprise operations, right?

350
00:21:08,523 --> 00:21:12,963
AI is playing a broader role and
then it is really helping around,

351
00:21:13,113 --> 00:21:14,293
around your inventory planning.

352
00:21:14,293 --> 00:21:17,663
Obviously, it helps your inventory,
optimize your inventory levels,

353
00:21:17,873 --> 00:21:20,093
reducing excess by 20 to 30%.

354
00:21:20,093 --> 00:21:25,043
It is very important that to manage your
inventory, excess and obsolescence is

355
00:21:25,043 --> 00:21:31,133
a big item where You need to have right
inventory of the right product, right?

356
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:34,973
A lot of times, all of this would
run into a situation where you

357
00:21:34,973 --> 00:21:37,193
are doing the right segmentation.

358
00:21:37,223 --> 00:21:41,273
Only when you do right segmentation of
your inventory, that is when you will

359
00:21:41,273 --> 00:21:43,463
have optimum inventory levels, right?

360
00:21:43,463 --> 00:21:47,673
having the right product, at the right
time to the, then only you'll be able

361
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:49,083
to give it to the right customer.

362
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,243
So inventory planning is
one, one critical one.

363
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,103
The second one is order planning, right?

364
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,243
Order planning is something.

365
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:56,353
Which is very important, right?

366
00:21:56,353 --> 00:21:59,133
when an order comes in,
it could be an EDI order.

367
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:01,193
It could be an e commerce order.

368
00:22:01,193 --> 00:22:02,093
It doesn't matter, right?

369
00:22:02,093 --> 00:22:04,313
At the end of the day, the
order comes into the warehouse.

370
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:09,633
Now, someone needs to Allocate the
order, someone needs to plan the order

371
00:22:09,633 --> 00:22:13,133
and someone needs to take it and pack it
and ship it out to the customer, right?

372
00:22:13,173 --> 00:22:18,133
All of this life cycle would
be really critical for any

373
00:22:18,133 --> 00:22:19,813
function to operate, right?

374
00:22:19,913 --> 00:22:24,433
So order planning is very critical from
a, from an overall, AI standpoint, right?

375
00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:30,403
It, AI helps you, increase your
order fulfillment accuracy by 95%.

376
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,393
There are a lot of warehouses.

377
00:22:32,743 --> 00:22:38,433
Who are leveraging a lot of autonomous
picking models and autonomous packing

378
00:22:38,433 --> 00:22:43,403
systems where The picking can happen a
robotic system can come and pick up the

379
00:22:43,413 --> 00:22:47,833
product and then drop it into the right
Location so that the packing system can

380
00:22:47,863 --> 00:22:52,248
pick it and then pack it and then So put
it at the FedEx doc or the UPS doc, right?

381
00:22:52,248 --> 00:22:54,298
So order planning is
also one critical thing.

382
00:22:54,618 --> 00:22:59,468
Not just that, giving visibility,
giving visibility to the

383
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,008
customer service team, right?

384
00:23:01,008 --> 00:23:04,468
we are living in a world where
we are operating with the help of

385
00:23:04,478 --> 00:23:07,678
a lot of contract manufacturers
and so on and so forth, right?

386
00:23:08,068 --> 00:23:11,908
A lot of times where a product is
moved from one place to another

387
00:23:11,998 --> 00:23:15,638
place, it is sourced from Asia,
it is sourced from Mexico, so

388
00:23:15,638 --> 00:23:17,218
it is sourced internally within.

389
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:19,033
But in the, country, right?

390
00:23:19,293 --> 00:23:22,793
So there is a movement of the product
from one place to another place.

391
00:23:22,793 --> 00:23:27,943
And it is very important for the customer
service team to have visibility of where

392
00:23:27,943 --> 00:23:29,943
that product is really right now, right?

393
00:23:29,943 --> 00:23:31,793
the container could be
sitting in the dark.

394
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:35,673
But then the customer service has no
visibility to that and then we will not be

395
00:23:35,673 --> 00:23:37,573
able to really do proper order planning.

396
00:23:37,953 --> 00:23:43,593
AI is really playing a critical role
where you can do your supply sensing and

397
00:23:43,593 --> 00:23:48,868
then you can have real visibility of the
data and eventually, customer service

398
00:23:48,898 --> 00:23:52,728
can have visibility of the data and then
they should be able to allocate and then

399
00:23:52,738 --> 00:23:54,738
do scheduling of those orders, right?

400
00:23:55,108 --> 00:23:58,858
will it really play a critical
role in a B2C industry?

401
00:23:59,133 --> 00:23:59,973
Yes, it will.

402
00:23:59,983 --> 00:24:02,643
Both B2B and B2C industry order planning.

403
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:08,293
as long as your volume of the orders
are critical, AI will definitely

404
00:24:08,353 --> 00:24:09,763
play a role in order planning.

405
00:24:10,453 --> 00:24:13,393
Capacity planning is
other big aspect, right?

406
00:24:13,443 --> 00:24:17,943
a lot of times when a product is planned
or when a product is manufactured,

407
00:24:18,163 --> 00:24:21,733
you need to ensure all your resources
which are going into the plant or

408
00:24:21,923 --> 00:24:23,868
into the capacity are required.

409
00:24:24,308 --> 00:24:25,568
accurately measure, right?

410
00:24:25,568 --> 00:24:30,228
a lot of times you run into a bottleneck
situation where one equipment is

411
00:24:30,248 --> 00:24:34,538
loaded heavily, one resource is
loaded heavily, and all of this is

412
00:24:34,538 --> 00:24:37,458
very data critical thing, right?

413
00:24:37,598 --> 00:24:42,768
So AI will come into play here and then
it will help you understand what is your

414
00:24:43,068 --> 00:24:48,313
resource modeling is, understand what is
your, Equipment modeling is understand

415
00:24:48,313 --> 00:24:53,373
what is your material modeling is and
do an intersection of all of this data

416
00:24:53,413 --> 00:24:58,143
and then come back with a capacity
planning model, which is more optimized.

417
00:24:58,303 --> 00:25:03,913
And then in turn, it will help you boost
your production and resource utilization.

418
00:25:04,153 --> 00:25:07,193
Finally, the cyber security and
threat detection is a big one.

419
00:25:07,193 --> 00:25:11,063
Obviously, you can control all
of that within the supply chain

420
00:25:11,313 --> 00:25:14,553
with the help of AI systems and
make sure your supply chain is.

421
00:25:14,948 --> 00:25:19,208
managed in the right way and is
stable and cost efficient way.

422
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:20,198
Okay.

423
00:25:20,308 --> 00:25:21,868
We got to the conclusion slide.

424
00:25:21,868 --> 00:25:26,028
So overall, I know we went through
the challenges, what applications will

425
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:28,188
be able to help within the AI space.

426
00:25:28,188 --> 00:25:29,498
We didn't go through all that.

427
00:25:30,118 --> 00:25:31,688
And then, conclusion, right?

428
00:25:31,688 --> 00:25:36,178
AI definitely will help you enhance
the resilience and efficiency, right?

429
00:25:36,178 --> 00:25:40,518
I mean, once that efficiency and
resilience is maintained, it will

430
00:25:40,528 --> 00:25:42,558
help you, keep up your position.

431
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:46,228
There is so much competitive
advantage, which you need to maintain

432
00:25:46,348 --> 00:25:48,518
and sustain your position, right?

433
00:25:48,568 --> 00:25:53,298
definitely adopting all of these
capabilities, leveraging some of

434
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:58,738
these capabilities, what AI offers
definitely makes you gives you

435
00:25:58,738 --> 00:26:01,888
that competitive advantage in the
market and in the industry, right?

436
00:26:02,488 --> 00:26:06,278
And then the last one, the future
potential as AI evolves, its role is

437
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:10,408
resilience and maintaining that agility
and cost management will continue

438
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:14,188
to grow with these applications and
predictive maintenance also can be done.

439
00:26:14,188 --> 00:26:15,648
So that's one critical one.

440
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:21,498
And the takeaway, finally, is AI is
essential for developing adaptable, robust

441
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:26,418
supply chains that meet the challenges
of the modern global economy, right?

442
00:26:26,563 --> 00:26:32,853
So AI is part of our day to day has
become part of our day to day and it is

443
00:26:32,863 --> 00:26:38,483
important for us to leverage and, and use
it in a right way wherever applicable.

444
00:26:38,483 --> 00:26:43,673
With that, I would like to conclude
and, would also like to, thank, conf42.

445
00:26:44,473 --> 00:26:48,613
com and, for giving me this
opportunity to share about AI

446
00:26:49,263 --> 00:26:50,933
and, it's, intricacies, right?

447
00:26:51,603 --> 00:26:54,243
I'm happy to take any
questions if there are any.

448
00:26:54,463 --> 00:26:55,763
Thank you for the opportunity.

449
00:26:56,143 --> 00:26:56,853
Appreciate it.
