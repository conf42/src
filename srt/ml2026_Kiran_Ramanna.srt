1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,339
Speaker 10: Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:06,529
My name is Kiran Ramana and I am
here today to share with you the

3
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:10,730
AI Readiness Blueprint, turning
ambiguity into opportunity.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,950
As generative AI transitions from
conceptual exploration to enterprise

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,970
skill deployment, organizations
are facing critical challenges.

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,350
What we are seeing is the
most AI initiative failures.

7
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:29,014
Don't stem from technological
limitations, they stem from inadequate

8
00:00:29,014 --> 00:00:30,514
organizational preparedness.

9
00:00:31,145 --> 00:00:34,955
This framework that I will share with
you today transforms organizational

10
00:00:34,955 --> 00:00:40,235
ambiguity into actionable opportunities
through sim, systematic assessment

11
00:00:40,265 --> 00:00:41,915
and structured implementation.

12
00:00:42,415 --> 00:00:43,715
So let's start with the problem.

13
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,160
The numbers are striking.

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,700
80% or more AI projects
fail to deliver value.

15
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,390
88% of AI pilots never reach production.

16
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,960
These are staggering failure rates,
but here is the core challenge.

17
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,680
Pilots pro.

18
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,940
The problem lies not in
technological capability.

19
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,110
We have amazing AI technology
today, but in organizational

20
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:10,870
preparedness, the fragmentation of
machine learning initiatives poses

21
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,550
a significant barrier to success.

22
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:16,015
What we see repeatedly is
isolated experiments that fail

23
00:01:16,015 --> 00:01:20,875
to deliver, measured, measurable,
enterprise impact and scalability.

24
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:23,475
This comes down to three root causes.

25
00:01:24,465 --> 00:01:25,995
First, fragmented data.

26
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:29,025
Disconnected data sources
prevent cohesive understanding.

27
00:01:29,535 --> 00:01:33,825
Second, unclear ownership, lack
of defined responsibilities

28
00:01:34,185 --> 00:01:36,255
causing delays and misalignment.

29
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:40,140
And third, the governance
inconsistent practices.

30
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,590
Jeopardizing model
reliability and quality.

31
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,190
Let's look at common failure patterns.

32
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,930
We see across organizations.

33
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,400
There are four patterns.

34
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,840
First, silo data.

35
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:56,690
Data ecosystems remain fragmented
and ungoverned across departments

36
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,000
preventing unified insights, the.

37
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,790
ML models lack comprehensive data
for accurate predictions leading

38
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,280
to biased or incomplete outputs.

39
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:12,360
Second misaligned teams across
functional cross-functional teams

40
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,950
operate with conflicting expectations
and unclear responsibilities.

41
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,620
This leads to style progress
due to confusion about who is

42
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,360
accountable for project success.

43
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,580
Third, lagging governance.

44
00:02:27,255 --> 00:02:31,635
Risk management protocols simply can't
keep pace with rapid AI deployment

45
00:02:31,725 --> 00:02:38,265
ambitions, limited oversight ize model,
real reliability, quality and compliance.

46
00:02:38,765 --> 00:02:43,535
And fourth, it's pilot sprawl,
disconnected experiments, proliferate

47
00:02:43,565 --> 00:02:44,885
without architectural coherence.

48
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,425
Our enterprise strategy, this results
in wastage, resources, technical

49
00:02:51,425 --> 00:02:53,225
debts, and organizational AI fitting.

50
00:02:53,725 --> 00:02:54,715
Here is the contrast.

51
00:02:55,195 --> 00:02:59,575
Typical pilot programs include
siloed data, ad hoc processes,

52
00:02:59,665 --> 00:03:01,825
and no path from pilot production.

53
00:03:02,575 --> 00:03:07,765
A production ready organization has
a unified data platform, standard

54
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:12,660
standardized processes aligned with
business and scalable ML implementations.

55
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,600
So what's the root cause?

56
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,450
Organizations lack a framework.

57
00:03:17,945 --> 00:03:20,315
Specifically, they lack four things.

58
00:03:20,585 --> 00:03:23,345
First, structured readiness assessment.

59
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:27,635
No systematic way to
evaluate EA capabilities.

60
00:03:27,995 --> 00:03:33,065
Second, stakeholder alignment,
business and tech teams work in silos.

61
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:40,145
Third optimizational parts, no clear
journey from pilot to production.

62
00:03:40,925 --> 00:03:45,125
And fourth is governance
framework, missing accountability

63
00:03:45,155 --> 00:03:46,565
and oversight structures.

64
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,685
This is the four steps.

65
00:03:50,225 --> 00:03:50,705
The result.

66
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:56,975
Without a structured framework,
organizations face technical debt,

67
00:03:57,545 --> 00:04:02,915
wasted resources, and ultimately
lost confident in AI initiatives.

68
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:08,375
What enterprises need is a comprehensive
readiness model, connecting

69
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:12,425
discovery through delivery with the
discipline governance at every stage.

70
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:16,755
So here is the solution,
the AI Readiness Blueprint.

71
00:04:17,535 --> 00:04:21,345
This framework makes three
unique contribution first

72
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:23,385
collaborative workshops.

73
00:04:23,715 --> 00:04:29,805
We transform assessment from a audit
activity into a collaborative code design

74
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,020
process, business leaders ML team, and.

75
00:04:33,735 --> 00:04:38,445
Data owners work together to identify
constraints and define the roadmap,

76
00:04:39,044 --> 00:04:42,434
the benefit, cross-functional
alignment from the outset.

77
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:45,364
Second stage gate governance.

78
00:04:45,664 --> 00:04:50,164
We establish clear governance
checkpoints between maturity

79
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:55,564
stages, requiring demonstrated
competencies before progression.

80
00:04:56,434 --> 00:04:59,824
There are structured review
gates at each milestone.

81
00:05:00,664 --> 00:05:06,144
This s. Mature premature
scaling and technical debt.

82
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:09,234
Third pilot sprawl mitigation.

83
00:05:09,714 --> 00:05:14,874
We codify readiness as measurable
progression across interdependent

84
00:05:15,054 --> 00:05:20,394
dimensions to consolidate fragmented
efforts, we use a readiness

85
00:05:20,394 --> 00:05:23,334
assessment, Canva for evaluation.

86
00:05:23,994 --> 00:05:28,254
This takes you from chaos to
coherent enterprise capability.

87
00:05:28,754 --> 00:05:31,034
Let me give you an
overview of the framework.

88
00:05:31,484 --> 00:05:35,594
It has five foundation pillars
with governance as a spanning

89
00:05:35,864 --> 00:05:38,534
concern across all the all of them.

90
00:05:39,194 --> 00:05:44,384
The five pillars are data preparedness,
focusing on quality and lineage,

91
00:05:45,254 --> 00:05:50,024
process, adaptability, focusing on
agile workflows, infrastructure,

92
00:05:50,024 --> 00:05:52,544
scalability for scalable system.

93
00:05:53,534 --> 00:05:58,655
Cultural enablement for ai,
literacy and governance and ethical

94
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,745
framework for ethics and compliance.

95
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:08,115
Now, governance spans all pillars as a
cross-cutting concern and organization

96
00:06:08,115 --> 00:06:13,725
progress through five maturity
stages, foundational, developing,

97
00:06:13,965 --> 00:06:16,305
defined, managed, and optimized.

98
00:06:16,845 --> 00:06:17,985
We will see through all of these.

99
00:06:18,485 --> 00:06:20,225
Let's dive into the first pillar.

100
00:06:20,615 --> 00:06:21,755
Data preparedness.

101
00:06:22,255 --> 00:06:26,905
Data infrastructure forms a bedrock
of successful AI implementation.

102
00:06:27,505 --> 00:06:29,125
There are four key dimensions,

103
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:34,380
completeness, full coverage of
your data, landscape accuracy,

104
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,780
consistency of your information.

105
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:44,705
Lineage, clear prominence tracking and
accessibility, discovering interfaces.

106
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:46,355
Why does this matter?

107
00:06:47,285 --> 00:06:51,005
A consolidated high quality
data foundation is essential

108
00:06:51,005 --> 00:06:53,285
for successful ML initiatives.

109
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:59,360
Without robust data foundation, even the
most sophisticated algorithms can flatter.

110
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,030
Process adaptability.

111
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:06,640
The second pillar, this is
about identifying appropriate

112
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,860
workflows for AI augmentation.

113
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,980
What makes a process an ideal candidate?

114
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,510
Three characteristics, it's
repetitive decision point,

115
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,880
are amenable to automation.

116
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:19,680
It's measurable.

117
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,880
Outcomes enable performance
validations and it's traceable.

118
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,300
There are clear input
output relationships.

119
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,480
You also need a continuous
improvement culture.

120
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:38,440
Foster iterative refinement, where teams
improve processes based on feedback.

121
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,600
Leverage flexible frameworks to
pivot quickly, empower teams to

122
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,445
innovate without rigid constraints.

123
00:07:46,345 --> 00:07:51,625
The key outcome here is that technology
investments target genuine operational

124
00:07:51,685 --> 00:07:54,145
improvements, not just experimentation.

125
00:07:54,645 --> 00:07:56,145
Third pillar infrastructure.

126
00:07:56,145 --> 00:07:56,834
Scalability.

127
00:07:57,614 --> 00:08:02,775
Your technical architecture must
support both current and future growth.

128
00:08:03,554 --> 00:08:05,775
There are four infrastructure components.

129
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:11,204
Compute flexible resources for variable
workloads with elastic scaling.

130
00:08:11,704 --> 00:08:16,444
Storage systems for sustainable
data volume with high

131
00:08:16,444 --> 00:08:19,165
throughput integration patterns.

132
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:24,844
Connecting to enterprise system and
observability, monitor behavior latency

133
00:08:24,844 --> 00:08:27,064
and resources with real-time insights.

134
00:08:27,564 --> 00:08:29,034
Why does scalability matter?

135
00:08:29,724 --> 00:08:31,854
It supports ML production environments.

136
00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:36,914
Provides flexibility to adjust
resources dynamically and ensures

137
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,984
optimal performance at all time.

138
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:43,624
The key benefit is that it prevents
technical debt accumulation and

139
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:46,714
enables smooth dev to pro transitions.

140
00:08:47,214 --> 00:08:51,430
So the fourth pillar is
governance and ethical frameworks.

141
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:57,099
Governance mechanisms must be embedded
throughout the deployment lifecycle.

142
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:02,999
There are four components, explainability,
clear model logic, and decision

143
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:09,119
traceability leads to stakeholder trust,
bias detection, fairness metrics, and

144
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:14,599
demographic parity protects against
discrimination, the compliance.

145
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:20,240
Regulatory mapping and documentation for
G-D-P-R-C-C-P and industry requirements.

146
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,900
All of them are taken care
and the risk assessment.

147
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,829
Review gates and impact analysis for
proactive failure identification.

148
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:35,670
You need formal policies for
model validation, data privacy,

149
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,100
and compliance verification.

150
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,949
The principle here is to balance
innovation velocity with risk

151
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:48,410
management, creating clear decision
pathway that maintain accountability

152
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,780
while enabling experimentation.

153
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,900
The fifth and final pillar,
cultural enablement technology

154
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:00,040
adoption depends on human capability
and organizational willingness.

155
00:10:00,594 --> 00:10:03,444
There are four elements of
cultural transformation.

156
00:10:03,864 --> 00:10:08,454
Yale literacy programs, building
knowledge across all organizational

157
00:10:08,454 --> 00:10:13,285
roles, cross-functional champions,
embedded advocates, driving

158
00:10:13,285 --> 00:10:18,854
adoption, shared ownership, model
accountability beyond technical teams,

159
00:10:19,604 --> 00:10:24,554
and change management proactively
addressing resistance patterns.

160
00:10:25,054 --> 00:10:26,059
Why does culture matter?

161
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:31,149
Cultivating AI literacy is essential for
fostering innovation and collaboration.

162
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:35,879
It empowers employees to
effectively utilize AI technologies.

163
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:43,009
The key insights is to treat AI adoption
as a change management initiative,

164
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,384
not just a technology deployment.

165
00:10:44,884 --> 00:10:49,324
Now it's important to
understand what these pillars,

166
00:10:49,864 --> 00:10:51,694
what these five pillars are.

167
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:52,655
Interdependent.

168
00:10:53,155 --> 00:10:56,875
Advancement in one enables
progress in others.

169
00:10:57,505 --> 00:11:03,145
The key relationships are data
enables process, which means

170
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:05,845
quality data enables automation.

171
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:11,905
Infrastructure supports data, which means
infrastructure, stores and processes.

172
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:18,854
Data governance spans all, which means
insight spans into all the pillars,

173
00:11:19,354 --> 00:11:25,084
and culture enables all, which means
people enables every other pillar Here.

174
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,894
You can't automate without quality data.

175
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,964
You can't scale without infrastructure.

176
00:11:30,384 --> 00:11:33,174
Governance spans all as
a crosscutting concern.

177
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:37,989
Culture underpins adoption
success across all dimensions.

178
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:42,779
Organizations evolve through five
distinct stages of AI readiness,

179
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,609
each with clear benchmarks.

180
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:48,839
Stage one, foundational ad
hoc experiments, limited

181
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:50,759
governance, isolated teams.

182
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:53,009
No coordination is needed here.

183
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:55,864
Stage two developing.

184
00:11:56,364 --> 00:12:01,824
Pilot projects and basic governance,
initial standards, and limited sharing.

185
00:12:02,785 --> 00:12:09,315
Stage three, it's defined clear protocols,
data strategy, coordination between

186
00:12:09,315 --> 00:12:11,595
teams, and also having structured teams.

187
00:12:12,225 --> 00:12:18,575
Stage four, managed stage gate controls
and performance metrics, scalable

188
00:12:18,575 --> 00:12:21,245
deployments and cross-functional teams.

189
00:12:22,145 --> 00:12:24,005
Stage five is optimized.

190
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,990
Continuous innovation, adoption,
governance, and strategic alignment

191
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,730
with organizational learning.

192
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:37,540
Think of it as building
foundations in stages one and two.

193
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,770
Standardizing processes in stage
three, scaling operations in stage

194
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,785
four, and achieving continuous
innovation in stage five.

195
00:12:47,285 --> 00:12:49,445
Let me show you the
implementation roadmap.

196
00:12:50,165 --> 00:12:50,705
Four.

197
00:12:50,705 --> 00:12:56,075
Progressive phases guide
organizations from assessment to

198
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:59,435
scale with disciplined governance.

199
00:12:59,825 --> 00:13:06,320
Phase one discovery, which has assessment
evaluate capabilities, identify

200
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,180
opportunity and conduct workshops.

201
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,390
Phase two is foundation build.

202
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,630
Data infrastructure, governance
frameworks and literacy programs.

203
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,280
Phase three is pilot.

204
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:23,680
It's experiment controlled
experiments, use case implementation,

205
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,090
and iterative refinement.

206
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,760
Phase four is scale, which is to deploy
enterprise deployment, comprehensive

207
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,040
monitoring, continuous improvements.

208
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,510
The timeline progresses through
assessment phase where you analyze

209
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,880
current ML capabilities and identify gaps.

210
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:45,550
Capability building where you develop
training programs to enhance team

211
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:51,640
skills, governance, formalization,
where you establish formal structures

212
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,560
for compliance and scaling readiness,
where you optimize infrastructure

213
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,060
and processes for production.

214
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,825
Note the stage gates between each phase.

215
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:03,235
These are critical governance checkpoints.

216
00:14:03,735 --> 00:14:05,835
Let's talk about Stagegate governance.

217
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:11,795
Clear checkpoints ensure requisite
capabilities before advancement,

218
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,595
preventing premature scaling.

219
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:15,935
The benefits are threefold.

220
00:14:16,475 --> 00:14:21,785
It prevents tech debt, balances risk and
speed, and provides measurable progress.

221
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:25,870
The gait assessment criteria
includes people readiness.

222
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,950
Skills and training.

223
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:33,790
Complete process transformation
has workflow, adapted technology.

224
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:39,970
Infrastructure means systems deployed
data quality, which is standards

225
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,830
are met, and governance maturity,
which means policies are enforced.

226
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,730
Now what if you are not
meeting the criteria?

227
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,050
There are recovery parts,
targeted capability building.

228
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:58,290
Extending timelines with
milestones, external partnership

229
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,150
are parallel track developments.

230
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,320
The key is that this isn't about failing.

231
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,010
It's about learning and building
capability Before you scale,

232
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:10,029
let's discuss collaborative
discovery workshops.

233
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:15,689
These transform assessment from audit to
co-design for effective AI deployment.

234
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:22,379
The workshop benefits are clear,
identify constraints, define roadmap,

235
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:27,890
enable collaboration, who participates
in these business sponsors provide

236
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,199
strategic objective and success criteria.

237
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:34,070
Enterprise architects provide
technical integration requirements.

238
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:37,699
Engineering leads assess
implementation feasibility.

239
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:42,729
Data owners provide data
availability and governance status.

240
00:15:43,229 --> 00:15:46,829
What are the workshops
outputs for key deliverables?

241
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,459
A maturity scorecard, a prioritized
gap list, a 90 day, or based on your

242
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:54,619
organization, say monthly or biweekly.

243
00:15:54,619 --> 00:15:58,309
Action plan a gate
criteria for progression.

244
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:03,339
Let me show you real world validations
for enterprise mapped against

245
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:06,099
five pillars and maturity stages.

246
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:12,879

and KPI gated stage gate rollouts.

250
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:34,869
They prevented $1.5 billion in fraud and
reached 200,000 users in eight months.

251
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:39,329
The second one is
Simmons in manufacturing.

252
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:43,009
Simmons, Amber, to be
specific, stage five.

253
00:16:43,954 --> 00:16:45,814
Optimized in four pillars.

254
00:16:46,594 --> 00:16:48,785
Stage three, defined in governance.

255
00:16:49,055 --> 00:16:56,525
They run a data mesh on Snowflake with
50 million data points per day, IT or ot.

256
00:16:56,584 --> 00:17:01,954
Convergence and co-creative
learning with shop floor workers

257
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:08,849
desserts, 99.99% quality, and 14
times productive improvements.

258
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:13,490
Third Unilever in supply chain
and consumer packaged goods.

259
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:17,270
Stage five optimized in most pillars.

260
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,939
Stage four managed in infrastructure.

261
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:27,829
They have an eight petabyte platform
processing 240 terabytes per week.

262
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:33,530
Their five stage AI ethic
process mirrors stage gate.

263
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,940
They trained 23,000 employees.

264
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:44,580
They are running over 500 AI projects with
50% risk reduction and the fourth Mayo

265
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:50,040
Clinic in healthcare, stage four, managed
in data, process and infrastructure.

266
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,040
Stage five, optimized in
governance and culture.

267
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,560
They have a patient data
stewardship model, which has the

268
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,080
view board as gate stage gate.

269
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,080
Multi-layer governance.

270
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,950
Their principle is
enablement, not gatekeeping.

271
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:14,139
They are running over 250 EI projects with
the deepest governance in the industry.

272
00:18:14,949 --> 00:18:19,090
All case studies data is sourced
from publicly available academic

273
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,540
publications which are cited here.

274
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,870
Let me summarize the key benefits.

275
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:28,879
These are transformative outcomes
from structured AI readiness

276
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:30,199
and discipline governance.

277
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:36,050
To successfully transition from
pilot to production organization

278
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,820
must emphasize discipline governance.

279
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,000
This ensures scalability, accountability,
and alignment with enterprise

280
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,800
objectives for maximum impact.

281
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:50,850
The six benefits are clarity, transform
ambiguity into actionable opportunity

282
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,070
with clear assessment criteria.

283
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:58,969
The readiness canvas provides structured
evaluation alignment, which bridges

284
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:04,370
the executive vision and technical
execution through collaborative workshops.

285
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:07,129
Cross-functional teams work together.

286
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:13,129
It is measurable, which means tracks
progress across in interdependent

287
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:18,439
dimensions with clear metrics using
five stage maturity, progressions,

288
00:19:18,939 --> 00:19:26,260
governance, balance, innovation,
velocity with risk management through

289
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,544
stage gates with formal policies and co.

290
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:37,004
Scalable, which is prevent pilots sprawl
and enable enterprise wide deployment

291
00:19:37,504 --> 00:19:44,645
go from fragmented pilots to production
and it's sustainable build foundations

292
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:48,665
for long-term AI transformation
and organizational learning.

293
00:19:49,165 --> 00:19:51,415
Cultural enablement drives adoption.

294
00:19:51,915 --> 00:19:53,025
How do you get started?

295
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:57,615
Your path to yay readiness begins
with cross-functional collaboration.

296
00:19:58,515 --> 00:20:03,555
You will use three practical
artifacts, the readiness assessment

297
00:20:03,555 --> 00:20:08,705
canvas, a maturity scorecard,
and a 90 day action plan.

298
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,745
Here are four steps.

299
00:20:11,675 --> 00:20:14,320
Step one, assess current state.

300
00:20:15,185 --> 00:20:17,405
Evaluate maturity across all five pillars.

301
00:20:17,945 --> 00:20:20,345
Step two, convene stakeholders.

302
00:20:20,405 --> 00:20:23,735
Bring together business
architecture and engineering teams.

303
00:20:24,235 --> 00:20:26,725
Step three, conduct discovery workshop.

304
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:30,265
Identify gaps and
prioritize opportunities.

305
00:20:30,955 --> 00:20:35,730
Step four, create 90 day
plan, or monthly or biweekly.

306
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:36,010
Plan.

307
00:20:36,805 --> 00:20:39,025
Define milestones and success criteria.

308
00:20:39,525 --> 00:20:41,565
Step five, establish governance.

309
00:20:42,165 --> 00:20:48,765
Set stage gate criteria for progression,
and then you follow a continuous

310
00:20:48,765 --> 00:20:57,495
cycle, assess, align, discover, plan,
govern, and execute, and also repeat.

311
00:20:57,995 --> 00:20:58,925
Let me conclude.

312
00:20:59,735 --> 00:21:04,820
The key to enterprise AI success lies
not in algorithmic sophistication.

313
00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:10,600
But in organizational discipline,
there are four principle to remember.

314
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,270
One, evaluate honestly.

315
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:20,000
Number two, organize systematically,
and three, build methodically.

316
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,450
And four is to scale responsibly.

317
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:30,470
The key takeaways, the five pillars
are data, process, infrastructure,

318
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,905
governance, and culture.

319
00:21:32,405 --> 00:21:36,095
Discipline governance ensures
scalability and accountability.

320
00:21:36,935 --> 00:21:41,465
Cross-functional collaboration
is essential for AI deployment

321
00:21:42,245 --> 00:21:47,915
and use readiness assessment
tools to identify improved areas.

322
00:21:48,415 --> 00:21:53,215
The AI Readiness Blueprint provides
the framework Enterprises need to

323
00:21:53,215 --> 00:21:58,620
convert fragmented pilot proliferation
into intelligent ecosystems.

324
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:04,150
Delivering sustained competitive
advantage through responsible,

325
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:08,650
manageable, and strategically
aligned intelligent automation.

326
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:09,629
Thank you.
