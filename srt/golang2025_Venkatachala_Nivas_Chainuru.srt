00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,170
Hello people.

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,910
My name is Vanka Cheru.

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,090
I'm a senior infrastructure
engineer in the Orange County area.

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,940
I the today, the topic I want to
present to you about, is optimizing

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,830
hybrid object-based storage for
scalability, performance, and cost

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,480
across on-premises and cloud environment
went of social media and advancements

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,520
in healthcare and financial industry.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,410
There has been a massive increase
in unstructured, data like,

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,110
videos, images, IOT sensor data.

10
00:00:31,604 --> 00:00:36,575
Which led to, a need for scalable
and cost effective storage solution.

11
00:00:37,055 --> 00:00:40,084
This presentation explores,
how object-based storage

12
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:42,424
architecture seamlessly integrate.

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,300
OnPrem on premises infrastructure
with cloud environments and to

14
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,290
optimize enterprise data management
addresses critical challenges

15
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,390
faced today by IT industry.

16
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,330
We'll go through the various
implementation strategies, cost

17
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:01,369
advantages, and performance improvements
to help you develop and, effective

18
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:03,019
strategy for your organization.

19
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:08,799
Organizations, today, face an
unprecedented, challenge in managing

20
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:09,789
the exponential data growth.

21
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:15,409
The object-based storage, can handle,
large volumes of unstructured data more

22
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,589
efficiently than, a traditional file.

23
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:24,679
Or, block storage organizations facing
exponential data growth in Glo, in the, in

24
00:01:24,679 --> 00:01:28,249
global data footprint, that byte, by 2025.

25
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:32,299
So organizations must embrace
and innovative storage solutions.

26
00:01:33,199 --> 00:01:38,139
That balance, performance, cost, and,
compliance, regulatory requirements.

27
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:44,079
Hybrid object-based storage has emerged
as an, critical foundation for enterprises

28
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,809
seeking competitive advantage in
data-driven economy, saving about 40% of

29
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:52,534
annual operational and maintenance cost.

30
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:57,354
Let's talk about hybrid architecture
of the hybrid, object based storage.

31
00:01:57,804 --> 00:02:01,654
Hybrid ob object based storage
architecture establishes, E

32
00:02:01,684 --> 00:02:06,159
echo seal echo system where
data can rec reside on premises.

33
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:10,819
Or in multiple clouds while
presenting a single unified, strategy

34
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:15,349
stor while pro, while providing a
single unified storage repository

35
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:17,019
to the, for all the applications.

36
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:22,209
This architecture implements industry
standard APIs and protocols, ensuring

37
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:27,049
seamless interoperability and consistent
data access methods, across local

38
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:29,059
infrastructure and cloud environments.

39
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:30,649
To talk about the architecture.

40
00:02:31,054 --> 00:02:34,579
the architecture typically consists
of, four layers, a management

41
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:38,670
layer, an application layer,
orchestration layer, and storage.

42
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,540
and storage.

43
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,600
so coming to the management layer, is
management layer, basically consists of.

44
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:49,565
it's a software frontend interface, helps
us access the entire infrastructure.

45
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:54,895
And, the application layer is nothing
but, user facing services and APIs

46
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:58,775
connecting backend storage and
cloud, in the orchestration layer.

47
00:02:59,185 --> 00:03:00,405
it's it functions.

48
00:03:00,405 --> 00:03:04,935
The orchestration layer functions as
the core of the system making data

49
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:09,535
placement, decisions, based on the
analysis of data access patterns,

50
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:14,645
performance requirements and cost
parameters, it continuously evaluates,

51
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,910
and automatically migrates data between.

52
00:03:17,315 --> 00:03:22,025
Appropriate storage tiers,
optimizing both performance and cost,

53
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:24,015
without any manual intervention.

54
00:03:24,345 --> 00:03:27,695
The storage layer, is nothing
but a physical backend

55
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:29,734
integrated hybrid storage.

56
00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:32,754
Let's talk more about orchestration.

57
00:03:32,854 --> 00:03:36,874
let's talk more about, the orchestration
or data tiering architecture,

58
00:03:37,364 --> 00:03:42,764
the intelligent, tiering, Engine
continuously analyzes metadata, and the

59
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:47,264
access patterns and business policies
to automatically orchestrate data

60
00:03:47,264 --> 00:03:49,754
placement across performance tiers.

61
00:03:50,054 --> 00:03:54,139
This zero touch optimization
ensures each data set.

62
00:03:54,809 --> 00:03:59,759
Resides on most economically efficient
storage layer while maintaining

63
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,999
compliance requirements and
performance service level agreements.

64
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:09,340
Data tier can broadly be classified in
two four tiers, hot tier, cold tier, and

65
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,750
archive, vomit tier and archive tier.

66
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:12,640
And my.

67
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:18,130
Hot tier is nothing but emission
critical workloads with high latency

68
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,589
requirements and maximum throughput.

69
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:25,110
We can leverage on-prem storage
platforms with, which has, flash

70
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,420
or high performance, SSD drives.

71
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:31,985
in it, coming to the Walmart tier,
the data that is not frequently

72
00:04:31,985 --> 00:04:36,365
accessed, but it is quite important
enough to maintain for future use.

73
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:42,294
Cold tier is, nothing but is data,
that can be stored in cloud, like

74
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:44,814
historical data sets, reporting data.

75
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:45,849
Things like that.

76
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,729
And in the archive tier it's nothing.

77
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:53,060
But, it's mostly about, comes to the
data protection suite, where data,

78
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,340
with data that requires an infinite
or long-term retentions to encompass

79
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,229
companies, regulatory requirements.

80
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:05,059
Best use case examples are healthcare
and financial sectors where they got to

81
00:05:05,059 --> 00:05:07,484
maintain, maintain, longer retentions.

82
00:05:07,984 --> 00:05:13,114
Here are some of the strategies, to
achieve cost optimization by analyzing

83
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:18,284
data lifecycle, identifying data,
access patterns, use, tier storage

84
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:24,464
solutions to store data based on its
frequency of access, hot data on high

85
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:27,214
performance, like our expensive storage.

86
00:05:27,489 --> 00:05:31,719
And coal data on cost effective,
slower storage implementing by

87
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:36,039
implementing tiering policies,
automating a data movement across

88
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:37,929
performance and slower storage.

89
00:05:38,264 --> 00:05:42,014
continuously monitoring, and
analyzing the performance metrics and

90
00:05:42,014 --> 00:05:43,784
refined data placement strategies.

91
00:05:44,264 --> 00:05:48,324
And, optimizing cloud resources
strategically select appropriate

92
00:05:48,324 --> 00:05:50,844
storage tiers and geographical regions.

93
00:05:51,124 --> 00:05:55,954
based upon the organization,
location, you can choose, the local,

94
00:05:56,234 --> 00:05:58,754
availability zones or something.

95
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,709
far from your organization, which
could be, most cost effective option.

96
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:09,439
So organizations implementing these
strategies or hybrid object storage

97
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:16,009
solutions consistently has achieved
about 30% or greater reductions in their

98
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,739
total cloud, cloud storage expenditures.

99
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:21,259
Through sophisticated tiering strategies.

100
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:26,459
So by conducting comprehensive analysis
of access, data access patterns and

101
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:31,599
regulatory requirements, IT departments
can establish automated governance

102
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:36,669
policies that dynamically position data
in the most cost effective location

103
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:39,579
without requiring any manual intervention.

104
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:44,769
On-premises Infrastructure investments
can also be maximized by this strategy

105
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:47,204
by allocating high performance capacity.

106
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:53,224
exclusively to latency sensitive
workloads while maintaining, simultaneous,

107
00:06:53,945 --> 00:06:58,435
while simultaneously leveraging, cloud
economics for substantial majority of,

108
00:06:58,745 --> 00:07:01,955
enterprise data that doesn't demand a sub.

109
00:07:02,164 --> 00:07:08,344
Second response times are consistent
IOPS performance, hybrid object

110
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:12,125
storage architecture meets, industry's
regulatory compliance and data.

111
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:15,155
Sovereign with an unified API layer.

112
00:07:15,544 --> 00:07:22,229
with 75 per up, up to 75% of the global
organizations are now, navigating multiple

113
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:24,000
overlapping regulatory frameworks.

114
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,390
Hybrid storage architectures deliver,
the essential flexibility needed

115
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,819
to address complex challenges.

116
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:34,810
Forward-thinking enterprises can
securely maintain sensitive workload

117
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:39,244
on premises while simultaneously
leveraging cloud economics to optimize.

118
00:07:39,664 --> 00:07:42,664
cost for less regulated
information assets.

119
00:07:42,935 --> 00:07:48,730
So with this unified API layer, we can
maintain data sovereignty, retention

120
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:54,730
policies, encryption, and audit
trail implementation, best practices.

121
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:59,015
it is always recommended to implement
these, solutions, these hybrid

122
00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:02,525
based solutions or hybrid storage
solutions or any solutions with

123
00:08:02,585 --> 00:08:04,985
industry standard best practices.

124
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:09,925
by successful, any successful hybrid
storage, implementation, approach,

125
00:08:10,245 --> 00:08:14,325
organizations to start with non-critical
workloads to refine their approach.

126
00:08:14,575 --> 00:08:19,225
as they go before me migrating more
sensitive applications to begin with,

127
00:08:19,285 --> 00:08:25,015
you start with an initial infrastructure
or environment assessment by evaluating

128
00:08:25,015 --> 00:08:29,095
the existing infrastructure data,
access patterns, and, getting

129
00:08:29,095 --> 00:08:32,305
through the compliant, getting to
know the compliance requirements

130
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:34,075
of that particular organization.

131
00:08:34,465 --> 00:08:38,455
And, identify, performance
sensitive workloads, and data

132
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:39,925
that could benefit from tiering.

133
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:44,095
Also to document, it's always
best practice to document all

134
00:08:44,095 --> 00:08:47,965
these regulatory constraints and
the infrastructure information,

135
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:51,545
that will view, that will further
influence the architecture decisions

136
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,705
coming to the architecture design.

137
00:08:53,895 --> 00:08:57,255
it's better to develop a
blueprint for integration between.

138
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:02,385
on premises and cloud resources, selecting
the appropriate storage technologies

139
00:09:02,385 --> 00:09:07,035
for each tier, and defining the API
integration points and establishing the

140
00:09:07,035 --> 00:09:09,195
performance baselines and expectations.

141
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:14,775
Policy development, is key in
creating, to create, automated data

142
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:19,965
tier policies based upon the access
patterns and, business defining the go

143
00:09:19,965 --> 00:09:24,075
governance frameworks for consistent
management across the environments and

144
00:09:24,075 --> 00:09:27,875
documenting all these, the security
controls and compliance measures.

145
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:30,065
Implementing and testing.

146
00:09:30,455 --> 00:09:33,455
So deploying integration
components and validate

147
00:09:33,455 --> 00:09:35,255
performance against the benchmarks.

148
00:09:35,585 --> 00:09:40,095
So test, a failover scenarios, testing
a failover scenario and data recovery

149
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:45,715
process, and also defining R-P-O-R-T-O,
recovery point objective, recovery

150
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:50,325
time objective, and, verify the policy
enforcement and audit capabilities

151
00:09:50,325 --> 00:09:51,885
are met across the environment.

152
00:09:52,215 --> 00:09:53,835
And also testing the RPO.

153
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:59,605
testing the defined RP one are, are
being achieved with this solution,

154
00:10:00,595 --> 00:10:02,065
with the implemented solution.

155
00:10:02,795 --> 00:10:05,795
let's, now let's go through, a case study.

156
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:10,575
Where the financial services, financial
organization was meeting, having a

157
00:10:10,575 --> 00:10:15,845
challenge and, where, they had five
petabytes of data increase, which

158
00:10:15,845 --> 00:10:19,775
is data is, has been increasing
and their infrastructure, existing

159
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:24,005
infrastructure could not be scaled,
due to financial constraints.

160
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,235
with the, by the way, the global
economy is, tumbling, to meet,

161
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:33,135
the growing analytic, to meet the
growing analytics and the workloads.

162
00:10:33,315 --> 00:10:38,235
While strict regulations, required certain
data to remain on premises, the solution

163
00:10:38,235 --> 00:10:40,665
that they chose was, the firm implemented.

164
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,310
a hybrid based storage architecture
with high performance flash on,

165
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,380
with high performance flash discs
on premises for active trading

166
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,840
data and other customer records.

167
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,080
and all their, unstructured data
integrated that with the cloud

168
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,400
storage for historical analysis,
and long-term retention, to meet

169
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,840
the regulatory requirements.

170
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,170
So they also adopted
an intelligent tiering.

171
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:10,480
algorithm, which automatically moves
data based on access pattern while

172
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,470
unified, while a unified, interface
provided consistent policy enforce

173
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,470
enforcement across all storage locations.

174
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:23,990
So the result was, reduced storage
cost by about, 30% in the first year.

175
00:11:24,385 --> 00:11:30,445
And improved the analytics per, improved
the performance by about 35%, and they

176
00:11:30,445 --> 00:11:37,835
were, yet achieved, they yet achieved
99.9 in compliance requirements, that

177
00:11:37,835 --> 00:11:39,965
was being set to their organization.

178
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:45,405
And also, and also they have decreased
the storage management overhead

179
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:50,895
by about 40%, and accelerated, new
application deployments by 60%.

180
00:11:51,105 --> 00:11:56,145
So when their organization had to
invest less on implementing the storage,

181
00:11:56,205 --> 00:12:01,295
implementing, storage, implementation
and their op storage operational costs.

182
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:06,795
They focused, and they leveraged
that, that financial budget towards

183
00:12:06,795 --> 00:12:11,775
deploying new applications, which, which
helps their organization, big time.

184
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:15,955
So let's talk about, future
trends in the hybrid storage.

185
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:20,785
So the hybrid storage landscape
continues to evolve rapidly with the

186
00:12:20,785 --> 00:12:25,025
emerging technologies, enabling more
intelligent and seamless integration

187
00:12:25,265 --> 00:12:27,245
between different environments.

188
00:12:27,425 --> 00:12:31,655
So organizations should prepare
for these advancements by building

189
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:35,405
a flexible architectures that
can adapt to future innovations.

190
00:12:36,185 --> 00:12:41,915
So industry analysts, predict that by
2025, by end of 2025, more than 70%

191
00:12:41,915 --> 00:12:46,505
of the enterprise data will be managed
through unified hybrid storage platforms.

192
00:12:46,685 --> 00:12:51,495
That dynamic, that dynamically
optimizes pla that dynamically optimize

193
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:55,865
placement, based on real time data
placement based on the real time

194
00:12:55,865 --> 00:12:58,025
analysis of workload requirements.

195
00:12:58,215 --> 00:13:01,275
key takeaway from this presentation are.

196
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,380
to assess your current environment
before, you implement the solution and

197
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:11,060
developing a solid tiering strategy,
which plays a CLO crucial role.

198
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,240
And also implementing a unified
management, solution by deploying

199
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,830
a robust orchestration tools that
provide comprehensive visibility and

200
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:26,650
control across your entire storage
ecosystem and prioritizing the APIs.

201
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:31,200
implementing the standard industry
best in industry, adapted APIs

202
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,440
and interfaces to ensure any,
frictionless operations regardless

203
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,390
of data, location and storage medium.

204
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,700
And finally, defining a clear
