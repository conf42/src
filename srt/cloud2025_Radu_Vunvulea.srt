00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,270
Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,699
Thank you for joining this session.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:12,080
Thank you for investing one hour
of your personal time to find more

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:19,870
about cloud, about AI, and how we
should modernize, how we should

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,420
prepare our cloud solution for AI.

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:30,094
My name is Radu Mvulevic, and for the next
50 55 minutes, I'm going to turn We'll

7
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:34,844
talk about AI, we'll talk about cloud,
we'll talk about how we can modernize,

8
00:00:35,344 --> 00:00:43,274
how we can prepare our applications that
are running on top of cloud for AI to

9
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:52,076
ensure that the system can work, can
provide data, can process the triggers,

10
00:00:52,206 --> 00:00:58,556
the events that are generated by the
AI solution, and in the end, how AI

11
00:00:58,636 --> 00:01:04,096
can be part of our cloud ecosystem
without having an impact, a negative

12
00:01:04,516 --> 00:01:07,396
impact on our end to end solution.

13
00:01:07,896 --> 00:01:11,476
Before going forward, I would
like to please introduce myself.

14
00:01:11,476 --> 00:01:12,316
My name is Radu.

15
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:13,671
Radu Gomogulev.

16
00:01:14,171 --> 00:01:20,381
I was born down the school, live and
work in a beautiful city called Cluj

17
00:01:20,421 --> 00:01:22,121
Napoca, in the middle of Transylvania.

18
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:27,821
And in my part time, I'm
investing time in communities,

19
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:30,081
learning, and in enjoying coffee.

20
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:33,194
I'm also Microsoft Azure MVP,
Microsoft Video Director.

21
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:40,013
If you want to contact me or to have a
chat with me on this topic or on all other

22
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:42,741
topics, feel free to reach me on LinkedIn.

23
00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:47,451
Why cloud is important for me is
because my journey on cloud started

24
00:01:47,451 --> 00:01:50,778
in 2019, and from that moment in
time, I was involved in different

25
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:53,426
projects on AWS and on my computer.

26
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:59,241
You will see that most examples that
I will provide in these sessions are

27
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:02,621
error specific, but the same service.

28
00:02:03,296 --> 00:02:09,906
have a one to one vendor, AWS,
or a system on Google Cloud.

29
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:13,776
you will find good mention of
the service that we are talking

30
00:02:13,786 --> 00:02:17,276
about today in all public vendors.

31
00:02:17,776 --> 00:02:18,606
What is my mission?

32
00:02:19,246 --> 00:02:21,296
What is my mission for today?

33
00:02:21,796 --> 00:02:29,226
Is to discover together with you how
the cloud architecture of an AI system,

34
00:02:29,726 --> 00:02:36,236
and now I'm not covering or I'm not
focusing On the AI books, but in the

35
00:02:36,236 --> 00:02:40,496
most of the cases, we are using more
or less out of the shelf services.

36
00:02:40,556 --> 00:02:44,646
We're just changing the model, playing
with the models in the cloud, but

37
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,626
hosting that service is already done.

38
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:54,376
The challenge is when we're doing
the integration, AI component goes

39
00:02:54,546 --> 00:03:01,736
in our cart and how we need to
ensure that these two can leave

40
00:03:02,196 --> 00:03:05,291
work, bring value to the business.

41
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:12,426
It doesn't make sense to talk about where
is Cloud 2024, where we being at the

42
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:15,346
end of 2025, what is the current impact?

43
00:03:15,346 --> 00:03:16,231
What is the future?

44
00:03:16,731 --> 00:03:20,621
We already know that we are
at the beginning of the cloud.

45
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:25,756
I say that we don't even know
what will be the real impact.

46
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:27,906
in five, ten years.

47
00:03:28,706 --> 00:03:31,856
We just hear different things,
not only from the software,

48
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:32,976
but also from the hardware.

49
00:03:33,476 --> 00:03:35,886
Autonomous cars, it's already here.

50
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:42,846
We already hear about half a million
robots will use AI maybe in a few years.

51
00:03:43,586 --> 00:03:44,746
We don't know where we'll be.

52
00:03:45,246 --> 00:03:50,496
We need to build systems that
can work, can interact, and

53
00:03:51,136 --> 00:03:53,426
can communicate in a good way.

54
00:03:53,926 --> 00:03:57,626
in a scalable way with AI services.

55
00:03:57,626 --> 00:04:07,086
I think that now we're in a phase like
we've been with data analytics in 2020.

56
00:04:07,586 --> 00:04:08,536
Why I'm saying this?

57
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:14,866
Because I see an analogy in 2020,
which had data layer on the system,

58
00:04:15,386 --> 00:04:17,931
not fully ready, hard analytics.

59
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:19,126
Now in

60
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,796
2025, I find us in the same situation.

61
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,641
In the same situation, but
not for data analytics.

62
00:04:26,326 --> 00:04:33,511
For ai, for the workload that AI is
bringing pressure, that is putting on

63
00:04:33,511 --> 00:04:40,851
existing system, on systems that in many
situations were migrating maybe in 2020,

64
00:04:40,851 --> 00:04:47,791
maybe in 21, 22, if the shift OnPrem to
cloud or in a way that let's push it,

65
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:51,801
let's push it, and maybe sometime in
the future we'll have enough time to.

66
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:57,001
to do modernization or to apply
the best practices and well

67
00:04:57,231 --> 00:05:00,211
attached framework that AWS Azure.

68
00:05:00,711 --> 00:05:06,211
I remember that I was talking about
serverless, about computation flavors that

69
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:09,791
you can have in cloud a few years ago.

70
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:13,171
And I was saying that we have
20 30 different flavors of

71
00:05:13,171 --> 00:05:17,161
containerization of serverless in AWS.

72
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:28,771
And now this is just a snapshot of end
of 2024 of a part of the AI services

73
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,411
that Microsoft Azure is offering.

74
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:32,201
And this is only the beginning.

75
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:32,441
It's

76
00:05:32,941 --> 00:05:36,811
not only training among customers.

77
00:05:37,351 --> 00:05:44,701
Now, using AI nowadays means To know to
select, maybe an out of the shelf plasma

78
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:52,021
service or a service solution that a cloud
web or a third party is providing that is,

79
00:05:52,521 --> 00:05:56,491
that is solving your need, your problem.

80
00:05:57,301 --> 00:06:00,511
You don't need to train a model
to do text to speech or speech

81
00:06:00,511 --> 00:06:05,791
to text or to do, document and
text extraction from a document.

82
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:11,281
Ah, if something already exists, why not
paste a service or in a different way?

83
00:06:11,336 --> 00:06:17,206
There are two core services
that are mostly used, especially

84
00:06:17,206 --> 00:06:18,796
when we talk about Azure.

85
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:23,036
We have this bunch of
services, extraordinarily good.

86
00:06:23,626 --> 00:06:28,266
And we have OpenAI and Azure ML.
That, of course, each of them

87
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:29,936
come with a studio and so on.

88
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:31,546
why they are relevant?

89
00:06:31,926 --> 00:06:36,260
First of all, Let's understand a
little bit the technical scope.

90
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:41,671
OpenAI is for when you have a pre
trained model, you don't do any kind

91
00:06:41,671 --> 00:06:47,576
of customization, you just focus on
taking the pre trained model, you do

92
00:06:47,576 --> 00:06:50,423
the, Integration based on the API.

93
00:06:50,423 --> 00:06:53,323
You don't need data scientists.

94
00:06:53,323 --> 00:06:55,813
You don't need MLOps, things like that.

95
00:06:56,323 --> 00:06:57,443
No training required.

96
00:06:57,493 --> 00:07:01,173
You just take out of the shelf and
build a code assistance, or the content

97
00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:03,123
generation, a shellpot, and like that.

98
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:04,323
They work perfectly.

99
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:08,863
I would say in 90 percent of the
cases, this is what you're looking.

100
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:12,903
On the other side, you have the Azure
Machine Learning, where The thing

101
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:18,613
that you use to work with Azure OpenAI
and the existing system cannot do too

102
00:07:18,613 --> 00:07:22,353
much because most of them might be
developers, infrastructure people,

103
00:07:22,353 --> 00:07:26,183
security, testers, and so on, data people.

104
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:27,433
They are great.

105
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:28,163
They are awesome.

106
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:33,353
But when you are using Azure Machine
Learning, then you do the training.

107
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,303
means that you need a data scientist.

108
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:38,503
You are focusing only on the model itself.

109
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:41,213
It is a project inside the program.

110
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:49,163
A program might be a full end to end AI
solution for a specific business stream.

111
00:07:49,663 --> 00:07:54,918
One of the components is building
All the ecosystem that needs to be

112
00:07:54,918 --> 00:08:02,138
around the part and another team,
another project is building that model.

113
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:03,438
Why this is important?

114
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:09,338
Because cloud, we already know,
it's not only virtual machines.

115
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:14,338
AI, and to have a real impact to the
business, it's not only the model.

116
00:08:14,338 --> 00:08:22,138
At the moment when you start to put an
AI service or an ML Inside your solution,

117
00:08:22,638 --> 00:08:27,678
you also need to create a bunch of
other services that we'll talk later

118
00:08:27,678 --> 00:08:30,248
on today to be able to support this.

119
00:08:31,088 --> 00:08:39,228
To expose the API, to manage the
payload, the trigger that they will

120
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:41,478
handle, access management and so on.

121
00:08:41,778 --> 00:08:44,838
This is what I want to do today.

122
00:08:45,388 --> 00:08:47,368
let's start step by step.

123
00:08:47,868 --> 00:08:52,008
What are the limitations of AI in
the cloud and the challenges and I'm

124
00:08:52,008 --> 00:08:57,198
not referring here for physical or
technical challenges of AI, but the

125
00:08:57,198 --> 00:09:04,648
real challenge is do a full integration
of an AI component in an existing

126
00:09:05,148 --> 00:09:10,618
ecosystem, cloud ecosystem without
or ensuring that you don't have a

127
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:17,953
direct impact on the current business
use cases and to not have a downside.

128
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:20,463
Or to not create bottlenecks.

129
00:09:20,963 --> 00:09:27,263
And also, to be able to supply to
that AI solution all the resources,

130
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:36,653
all the flows that are required to
be able to respond to the AI needs.

131
00:09:37,153 --> 00:09:37,473
Now,

132
00:09:37,973 --> 00:09:40,203
AI comes with a lot of challenges.

133
00:09:40,703 --> 00:09:47,983
Data security, privacy, bias of AI,
ethical consideration, complexity,

134
00:09:47,993 --> 00:09:51,746
the technical limitation, the legal
challenges, and the regulatory compliance,

135
00:09:51,746 --> 00:09:57,853
and of course, how it would impact
the work that we are doing today.

136
00:09:57,853 --> 00:10:03,818
I want to highlight one or two of them
because I think these are very important.

137
00:10:04,318 --> 00:10:05,908
Volume and sensitivity of data.

138
00:10:06,408 --> 00:10:12,388
Sensitivity of data is not only to ensure
that the AI can crunch what is allowed.

139
00:10:12,888 --> 00:10:18,008
only, but also refer to the person
that would use that a service that you

140
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:23,268
are putting inside the system would
be able to see and access only the

141
00:10:23,268 --> 00:10:24,628
information that they are allowed to.

142
00:10:25,128 --> 00:10:29,648
A very basic example, a database
with salaries, the classical

143
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,698
problem of HR and financial.

144
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:38,648
And you need to ensure that people
can ask, let's say, to a GPT.

145
00:10:39,148 --> 00:10:45,728
And to get data only for, or only
for financial information regarding

146
00:10:45,858 --> 00:10:47,718
the people that they are managing.

147
00:10:48,218 --> 00:10:51,518
Not of their managers, not of
people from different departments.

148
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,148
In Excel, we have
different ways to do this.

149
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,838
In the database, we have different ways.

150
00:10:56,248 --> 00:11:00,828
In order to ensure that the same
thing is happening when building AI.

151
00:11:01,408 --> 00:11:03,228
Volumes are important.

152
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:07,778
When we say volume, we are referring
that AI needs to crunch data.

153
00:11:08,443 --> 00:11:10,543
It is putting a high
pressure on your system.

154
00:11:10,543 --> 00:11:15,403
You need to ensure that your data,
your repo, can manage that volume.

155
00:11:15,903 --> 00:11:19,923
Going with data, because this is
the thing that I want to highlight,

156
00:11:19,963 --> 00:11:22,123
is data governance and compliancy.

157
00:11:22,623 --> 00:11:28,330
A lot of time, I would say, small to mid
sized companies didn't have to manage

158
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,563
and to create a catalyst for data.

159
00:11:31,828 --> 00:11:35,057
to understand what kind of data
they are storing, what can be

160
00:11:35,057 --> 00:11:36,940
shared with you, who, and so on.

161
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:42,508
And there is a shock, I would say
even cultural shock, in the moment

162
00:11:42,518 --> 00:11:47,128
in time when they realize that we
need to create a catalog of our data.

163
00:11:47,628 --> 00:11:48,638
Why is it a shock?

164
00:11:49,018 --> 00:11:53,598
It's not because it's hard to do,
it's because of the cost and the

165
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:57,717
complexity is coming with that part.

166
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:02,997
A nice thing that I really like regarding
job displacement and human workforces

167
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:11,832
At the beginning of 19 19, 5 19, and we
used to have people that was, that were

168
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:17,983
throwing guns in your wind in the morning
and sure that people would wake up.

169
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:20,997
to go in the factories.

170
00:12:21,497 --> 00:12:26,607
Think about AI, might reinvent
the jobs, the workforce.

171
00:12:27,097 --> 00:12:31,017
In the end, we will equal, but
this is a topic for another

172
00:12:31,057 --> 00:12:32,557
session in a different course.

173
00:12:33,057 --> 00:12:39,637
Next, together with you, I would like to
highlight five key areas of modernization.

174
00:12:40,277 --> 00:12:43,777
It needs to be tackled, needs
to be covered, needs to be

175
00:12:43,777 --> 00:12:50,937
considered when we talk about
putting AI inside existing systems.

176
00:12:50,953 --> 00:12:56,312
There are more than five,
but these five I want to do.

177
00:12:56,812 --> 00:13:00,372
First one is scalability
and performance bottlenecks.

178
00:13:00,372 --> 00:13:02,062
Scalability of the works.

179
00:13:02,312 --> 00:13:08,922
We need to have systems that can
scale, that can provide to the AI layer

180
00:13:09,172 --> 00:13:11,734
all the resources that are required.

181
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:16,892
GPO, for example, other
type of computation, memory.

182
00:13:16,942 --> 00:13:18,942
performance bottlenecks
sometimes are forgotten.

183
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:24,602
Because the bottlenecks don't
come all the time from the AI.

184
00:13:25,102 --> 00:13:31,882
The bottleneck is generated
because AI is trying to do too

185
00:13:31,882 --> 00:13:34,232
many queries to an API endpoint.

186
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:41,212
Or he's generating too many
triggers because event would be if

187
00:13:41,272 --> 00:13:43,662
we have an event driven approach.

188
00:13:43,682 --> 00:13:46,122
But too many triggers
to some API endpoints.

189
00:13:46,752 --> 00:13:50,782
And the system is not able to
manage all of them, and we start

190
00:13:50,782 --> 00:13:56,072
to see, let us see, we start to see
bottlenecks that in the end might

191
00:13:56,072 --> 00:14:00,192
create a butterfly or a domino effect.

192
00:14:00,692 --> 00:14:06,742
The second thing is the data
seal and how you can govern.

193
00:14:07,362 --> 00:14:09,402
The government part we
already touched a little bit.

194
00:14:09,902 --> 00:14:16,512
data catalogs, and how you keep the
data secure, what kind of data you're

195
00:14:16,512 --> 00:14:23,282
exposing, having the ability to
control what you provide to different

196
00:14:23,482 --> 00:14:25,462
users and to different environments.

197
00:14:25,962 --> 00:14:29,872
Because in a very sensitive
industry, you might prefer the bot

198
00:14:30,392 --> 00:14:36,052
to respond in a specific way if,
the user is using a secure device

199
00:14:36,052 --> 00:14:37,792
that is part of your organization.

200
00:14:38,657 --> 00:14:44,017
And if the same request is coming
from a public endpoint, from the

201
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:49,610
internet, from a non secure device,
you might have a different response.

202
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,637
Simplified or having your IP kept.

203
00:14:54,137 --> 00:14:55,997
Data seals is another thing.

204
00:14:56,497 --> 00:15:02,617
Data seals means that you have your data,
you have your repos in multiple places.

205
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:06,937
Because you have an organization
with a lot of departments.

206
00:15:07,437 --> 00:15:12,807
Because you might have 100 factories
or 1000 factories around the globe,

207
00:15:13,427 --> 00:15:16,237
and each factory has their own repo.

208
00:15:16,927 --> 00:15:21,257
And if you want to run something
globally or across all organizations,

209
00:15:21,757 --> 00:15:28,557
then You need to decide how you create
a data lake that is ready for AI.

210
00:15:29,057 --> 00:15:29,997
It's not impossible.

211
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:34,927
It doesn't mean all the time that you
need to copy all the data in place.

212
00:15:35,427 --> 00:15:37,617
You should do anything.

213
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:40,727
And you should avoid that model.

214
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:48,535
AI service to access multiple, repos that
are across different locations and so on.

215
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:49,860
And in the end.

216
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:58,180
In the same way, you find solution how
to create a reporting dashboard and

217
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:05,430
views that differ at production line,
where details at the factory level,

218
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,250
more, the granularity is bigger because
you have a factory manager directly

219
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,770
looking at the data at global level.

220
00:16:14,525 --> 00:16:21,145
Again, more, more granular or with
a bigger , because you don't want

221
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,890
to have . All the details, similar
principles would be applied.

222
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,115
So four solutions and for the
data that is consumed by ai,

223
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,465
and now we go to the third one.

224
00:16:33,555 --> 00:16:36,710
What is the right balance between
innovation and compliance?

225
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,805
How important and what kind of borders?

226
00:16:39,305 --> 00:16:42,595
To define from the co compliancy,
from the governance's point of view,

227
00:16:43,095 --> 00:16:49,785
to give enough liberty to freedom, to
give enough freedom for innovation.

228
00:16:50,285 --> 00:16:53,145
There's something that is different
from organization to predict,

229
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,605
but governance is required.

230
00:16:56,605 --> 00:17:02,836
But so at the same time, AI
gives you the freedom to search.

231
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:07,976
Combine information in a different way,
and this is from where innovation comes.

232
00:17:08,536 --> 00:17:10,796
Finding the right balance between
these two, it's a challenge.

233
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:19,156
The fourth thing is how you move,
how you, manage the cost of the

234
00:17:19,156 --> 00:17:21,916
AI and the full cloud ecosystem.

235
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,026
What is the, what is the line between?

236
00:17:25,936 --> 00:17:32,716
Sacrificing performance or accept that
you have a latency or maybe the AI system

237
00:17:32,716 --> 00:17:38,746
is not aware of everything but would
allow you to keep posts under control.

238
00:17:39,246 --> 00:17:45,546
It's for example like if you are using
your Application Insights at the beginning

239
00:17:45,596 --> 00:17:48,886
when you're starting to use it, you
say, oh yeah, I will keep everything,

240
00:17:49,396 --> 00:17:53,376
everything installed and after a few
days or weeks you realize, oh my god,

241
00:17:53,876 --> 00:18:00,726
Application Insights cost me almost as
much as the computation and database.

242
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:06,946
Exactly, this is the context for
the performance in the context.

243
00:18:07,446 --> 00:18:13,246
And the last thing is about deployment,
about agility and efficiency.

244
00:18:13,746 --> 00:18:20,301
And you have the models, you have the
MLOps, and you need To ensure that you

245
00:18:20,301 --> 00:18:25,171
can deploy them easily all in, in all
environments, you can easily create the

246
00:18:25,181 --> 00:18:29,081
full ecosystem that you're looking for.

247
00:18:30,051 --> 00:18:32,581
So what are the key of,

248
00:18:33,081 --> 00:18:36,911
personally, and that's my personal
opinion, is the key of success

249
00:18:36,911 --> 00:18:41,651
of an AI system that is running
inside cloud is not only AI.

250
00:18:42,151 --> 00:18:47,961
Partially, an important part is
about application modernization,

251
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:55,711
ensuring that you are using not a state
of the art services and architecture, but

252
00:18:55,891 --> 00:19:04,231
you are using the right cloud services,
the right approach in the cloud that

253
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:08,711
would allow to have a scalable, efficient

254
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:13,671
system that can work together with
AI, keeping the cost under control.

255
00:19:14,171 --> 00:19:17,411
and deliver business
value to the end customer

256
00:19:17,911 --> 00:19:23,781
without affecting other business
streams or dimension of your solution.

257
00:19:24,281 --> 00:19:26,031
How can we achieve this?

258
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:32,191
From the five areas of modernization
we can derive that we are talking

259
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:35,451
about scalability and performance.

260
00:19:35,951 --> 00:19:42,336
Features like auto scaling based
on Real internal metrics of the

261
00:19:42,336 --> 00:19:48,316
systems are knowing exactly when
you need to scale for how much.

262
00:19:48,696 --> 00:19:52,696
What is the upper limit and when you
need to scale down, it's very important.

263
00:19:53,196 --> 00:19:57,486
If you ever tried to find the right
balance of the scaling system, when

264
00:19:57,486 --> 00:20:00,876
you should trigger the scaling for
how long and so on, you already

265
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:03,596
know that it's not as easy.

266
00:20:04,556 --> 00:20:10,176
And even nowadays, in many situations,
scaling decisions are taken manually.

267
00:20:10,186 --> 00:20:14,436
You have alerts, somebody from the
support is looking at the alerts,

268
00:20:14,476 --> 00:20:16,906
and decide what needs to be done.

269
00:20:17,406 --> 00:20:20,216
The second thing is data
integration and management.

270
00:20:20,716 --> 00:20:23,166
We've talked about data savings.

271
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,366
We've talked about that we need to unwind.

272
00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:29,656
On the market, there are a lot of data
lake solutions and warehouse systems.

273
00:20:30,156 --> 00:20:32,806
What is important before putting data?

274
00:20:33,436 --> 00:20:38,906
The key before putting the AI is
to ensure that not only you bring

275
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:46,366
everything under the same umbrella, but
also the data, structure on structure

276
00:20:46,366 --> 00:20:55,233
data, is exposed in such a way that
the AI service, the AI model, is able

277
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:59,166
to understand and is able to crunch.

278
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:04,221
The next component is about
flexibility and agility.

279
00:21:05,011 --> 00:21:11,491
You need to have the capacity, you need
to provide to the team the ability to be

280
00:21:11,491 --> 00:21:19,381
able to deliver, to release in different
specific environments, dev environments,

281
00:21:19,381 --> 00:21:23,861
testing environments, reproduction
environments, as easy as possible.

282
00:21:24,361 --> 00:21:29,511
The AI service, their ML model,
anything that is related to the

283
00:21:29,511 --> 00:21:30,681
system that they are building.

284
00:21:31,161 --> 00:21:33,221
As you have, for example, the capability.

285
00:21:33,721 --> 00:21:39,106
to do 10, 15 releases in the
development environment per day.

286
00:21:39,106 --> 00:21:46,661
The same agility is required for the
ML models, or for the AI services

287
00:21:46,661 --> 00:21:51,601
that are working, because the team
needs to have the ability to test, to

288
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:57,261
see how it behaves in an environment,
to get the output, and then to do

289
00:21:57,301 --> 00:21:59,441
any kind of modification or changes.

290
00:21:59,941 --> 00:22:03,751
Easy to say, much harder to implement.

291
00:22:04,251 --> 00:22:08,861
I remember in 2024, at the beginning,
almost, I think in the same period of

292
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:15,501
time, February, March, I was saying
that yet we don't have the right

293
00:22:15,651 --> 00:22:19,956
tool and the level of maturity of
the truth is not enough to be able to

294
00:22:19,956 --> 00:22:22,436
work with a, to work with the cloud.

295
00:22:23,306 --> 00:22:28,241
Now in 2025, I would say that the tool
that we have now available on the market.

296
00:22:28,741 --> 00:22:35,241
are pretty much sure they're not perfect,
but we start to have that development

297
00:22:35,831 --> 00:22:45,711
ecosystem that is allowing us to design,
build, operate any services, any models

298
00:22:45,711 --> 00:22:49,271
in production and non production.

299
00:22:49,771 --> 00:22:54,081
When we talk about these tools,
don't think about tools that are

300
00:22:54,401 --> 00:22:56,871
related to training the models.

301
00:22:57,721 --> 00:22:58,041
No.

302
00:22:58,451 --> 00:23:06,601
I want to talk about the tools and the
capability to secure, to do data catalog,

303
00:23:07,101 --> 00:23:14,131
to do compliancy checks of AI services
and what are exposing through them.

304
00:23:14,631 --> 00:23:21,891
We have nowadays more and more
AI solutions that are capable to

305
00:23:22,311 --> 00:23:29,961
integrate, are capable to communicate
with, let's call them enterprise.

306
00:23:30,461 --> 00:23:35,011
I'm referring now to
Atlassian, Jira, Confluence.

307
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:38,521
I'm referring now to
SharePoint, to OneDrive.

308
00:23:39,021 --> 00:23:43,951
Because in the end, you don't want
to write your own custom integration.

309
00:23:44,451 --> 00:23:47,181
You just want more or less
to do a drag and drop.

310
00:23:47,651 --> 00:23:55,221
As you are consuming an APN from, let's
say, regarding, the train schedule,

311
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:57,251
the same thing you want in an APN.

312
00:23:57,751 --> 00:24:04,431
that is already available from ClassyARM
or from Microsoft that allow you to

313
00:24:04,431 --> 00:24:11,431
crunch access information that is
available on SharePoint based on your

314
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:15,581
role, based on your grade, based on
the group that you're part of or office

315
00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:19,770
and create a response specific to it.

316
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:24,700
There are many others that we will touch
more or less in the next half an hour.

317
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,600
Security and Compliancy, where I
would like to highlight, let me, I

318
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,680
would like to highlight policies.

319
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:39,665
Policies, from my perspective, are
one of the most important, terms.

320
00:24:40,165 --> 00:24:45,095
Of security when to close the
efficiencies and we'll come back in a

321
00:24:45,095 --> 00:24:48,155
few minutes to this are very important.

322
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:54,465
Many people don't realize the real cost
and the real impact integrating on a

323
00:24:54,495 --> 00:24:56,655
solution only after taking a production.

324
00:24:57,265 --> 00:24:58,395
the running cost?

325
00:24:59,045 --> 00:24:59,475
Double.

326
00:24:59,975 --> 00:25:04,105
And, at the moment in time, there might
not be too many options to take action.

327
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:09,260
Interoperability is exactly what we
were talking about with the example

328
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,030
of SharePoint, with Atlassian.

329
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:16,030
And, the last thing about real
time analytics, basically,

330
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,350
the operationalize of AI.

331
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,906
Also about this topic, we will
come back in a few minutes.

332
00:25:21,906 --> 00:25:23,980
Now, what are the keys of AI

333
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,110
monetization?

334
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,120
I prepared some services.

335
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:33,730
As I said, I'm giving examples from Azure,
but you will find the second dimension.

336
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,350
The service on AWS and on Workflow.

337
00:25:36,975 --> 00:25:40,435
The things that are crucial,
and indirectly, we touched

338
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:42,285
them in the previous slide.

339
00:25:42,785 --> 00:25:44,125
Why do you think that they are crucial?

340
00:25:44,135 --> 00:25:49,715
Because at least with what we have on
the market, on, on 2024 and the beginning

341
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:56,225
of 2025, they need more or less to
be dead products or similar products.

342
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:01,065
Yeah, most of the products are similar,
it's just different implementations.

343
00:26:01,565 --> 00:26:06,215
One of the most important ones is
Azure Kubernetes service, or any

344
00:26:06,215 --> 00:26:10,875
other flavor of modernization like
approach where you have your workload.

345
00:26:11,825 --> 00:26:12,365
And why?

346
00:26:13,195 --> 00:26:17,045
One of the biggest problem is
how you manage the workload.

347
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:22,895
Because inefficient managing
workloads could create problems.

348
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:28,955
Create issues regarding scaling,
regarding latency, and how

349
00:26:29,235 --> 00:26:30,015
you manage your resources.

350
00:26:30,515 --> 00:26:34,995
You need in the end a solution
where you can, when you create

351
00:26:35,005 --> 00:26:38,525
a cluster, 200, 500 nodes.

352
00:26:39,305 --> 00:26:42,688
and you don't, and not all
the nodes are the same.

353
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:47,655
You have nodes with GCP capability,
with different GCP power.

354
00:26:48,045 --> 00:26:50,935
Other with CPU, other
for memory intensive.

355
00:26:51,705 --> 00:26:56,965
And in the whole ecosystem that you're
building, you have the capability to

356
00:26:57,055 --> 00:27:04,455
specify that workload goes on GCP, on
GCU, that workload goes on specific

357
00:27:04,515 --> 00:27:09,555
AMD interprocessors, that goes on
ARM, that goes on different types.

358
00:27:10,475 --> 00:27:16,065
And this gives you the, this gives you the
flexibility to the full orchestration that

359
00:27:16,185 --> 00:27:22,225
only, not only, improve the performance
of the systems, but also you can run

360
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:24,625
them more smooth, more cost efficient.

361
00:27:25,615 --> 00:27:31,085
Because in the end, you have a system
that's scalable, you deploy resources,

362
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:37,035
even if they're pretty complex, it's
more easy to stick them on the right

363
00:27:37,435 --> 00:27:44,680
nodes type, and you don't end up in a
situation where you use Expensive and

364
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,100
very powerful nodes for simple and basic.

365
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,000
the second thing is selfless.

366
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:54,870
When I say selfless, for example,
Azure Functions, I'm not thinking

367
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,580
about running your AI stuff in service.

368
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,210
You could do that problem.

369
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:05,590
One of the biggest problem, the
biggest challenge is that a complex AI

370
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:13,970
system can generate is all the events,
all the triggers that are generated

371
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:18,300
You might say, oh, you go to an
API, but you might have to fix

372
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,970
what, how you would manage them.

373
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:28,360
You can go very easily on an event driven
approach where you have the AI that is

374
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,950
pushing events and behind the events.

375
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,560
You have some functions, you have some
serverless approach that is triggered in a

376
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,770
moment in time when there are two events.

377
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,920
And then you can scale up
or down based on your needs.

378
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:49,610
It's up to you if you run your serverless
in your own cluster or you go in a more

379
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:53,220
serverless approach and you pay per
consumption or in a combination between.

380
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:59,465
In the end, you need an event driven
approach plus a serverless approach.

381
00:28:59,515 --> 00:29:05,405
approach for ensuring that you can
dynamically scale and manage that work.

382
00:29:05,905 --> 00:29:12,005
The third component that I see
relevant is the ability to ensure

383
00:29:12,035 --> 00:29:14,185
that you avoid as much as possible.

384
00:29:14,685 --> 00:29:19,865
You can train your AI model and
your AI service can efficiently

385
00:29:20,475 --> 00:29:26,155
access data as close as possible
to the location where it's running.

386
00:29:26,575 --> 00:29:31,305
The other needs to do a lot
of requests across multiple.

387
00:29:31,805 --> 00:29:35,605
This is where a data lake
approach is the right way.

388
00:29:36,335 --> 00:29:37,795
There are a lot of tools on the market.

389
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:41,895
One of the services that I
really enjoy is Vital Fabric.

390
00:29:41,995 --> 00:29:42,295
And why?

391
00:29:42,295 --> 00:29:46,675
Because it brings under the
same umbrella the full journey

392
00:29:47,175 --> 00:29:50,645
for a piece of data from the
moment in time when it's ingested.

393
00:29:51,145 --> 00:29:53,935
It's different transformation
has applied to them.

394
00:29:54,175 --> 00:29:56,905
It's stored until the
moment when it's ingested.

395
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:01,385
Somebody's access and based
on a catalog, what is access

396
00:30:01,455 --> 00:30:04,155
and in the end are high or is

397
00:30:04,655 --> 00:30:11,875
using mysotherapy or something similar to,
and, in a seamless approach regarding data

398
00:30:11,955 --> 00:30:19,060
access, data transformation, and having a
catalog and understanding of what data is

399
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,032
stored and who should access different.

400
00:30:22,032 --> 00:30:24,510
We know already that AI.

401
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:27,030
it's about using, data.

402
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,920
Three or four years ago,
everybody was saying data is gold.

403
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:37,560
And now, we can, we have the
area that on top of data can

404
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:40,870
extract the value of the content.

405
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,980
And we want to expose it.

406
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,920
Exposing, it's not done
directly from that area.

407
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:53,050
Exposing the data requires
classical, like an API.

408
00:30:53,715 --> 00:30:58,945
like a load balancer, usually a
level 4 balancer, if you go with me.

409
00:30:59,225 --> 00:31:01,985
And more nicely, maybe an
Azure Application Gateway.

410
00:31:02,005 --> 00:31:08,355
Because, first of all, you want to
protect yourself from the people.

411
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:14,185
You need to ensure that you can balance
the traffic, you avoid downtime,

412
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:17,315
and the performance are acceptable.

413
00:31:17,815 --> 00:31:21,765
Having a load balancer like Azure
Application Gateway gives the ability.

414
00:31:22,265 --> 00:31:28,115
to manage the latency and to balance
the traffic and also, protect you

415
00:31:28,155 --> 00:31:29,375
from different type of attack.

416
00:31:29,395 --> 00:31:35,235
Because having, for example, application
gateway, is the, with what helps you.

417
00:31:35,245 --> 00:31:40,245
Let's say that we have the AI
service, you have a API layer,

418
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,645
that you're on top of that, and
you have other application gateway.

419
00:31:45,145 --> 00:31:50,205
Well, a web based attack is
happening, all that load.

420
00:31:50,705 --> 00:31:56,325
It's the application gateway and the load
balancer, meaning that the computation

421
00:31:56,325 --> 00:32:04,755
available for your business or AI model
will remain available for your own use.

422
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:09,855
It will not be consumed by different
systems that would protect you from this.

423
00:32:10,355 --> 00:32:11,900
We are talking about real time.

424
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:18,190
We are talking about the streaming events,
about triggering different activities.

425
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,571
Azure events have about one.

426
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:25,500
Any other approach of an event
based solution is important

427
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,760
from two perspectives.

428
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:35,320
One is the ability to allow an AI
solution to trigger and to scale

429
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:42,030
up the number of Actions that he
wants to run might be actions as

430
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,320
looking in a different location.

431
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,810
Might be actions like
triggering, for example, closing

432
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:49,900
a door or securing a house.

433
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,110
On the other hand, when we talk
about AI, everybody is talking

434
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,818
about real time, near real time.

435
00:32:55,818 --> 00:33:03,170
If you have a system that is modifying
all the time, then you need an ability,

436
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,710
you need the capability, to ensure.

437
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:09,870
that you are receiving a
change in that, update.

438
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:14,200
To be able to implement a real time
data ingestion system, receive a

439
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,790
stream of updates, you would need to
go with an event streaming approach,

440
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,770
and use a service like Error Info.

441
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:28,750
Because you're not only scaling, also,
you can be aware, or your solution

442
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:32,110
can be aware in near real time.

443
00:33:32,955 --> 00:33:35,315
regarding what is happening around.

444
00:33:35,815 --> 00:33:40,335
The last service that I would
like to highlight is copy, joking.

445
00:33:41,205 --> 00:33:41,895
It's about catalog.

446
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,035
It's about the data catalog.

447
00:33:44,795 --> 00:33:48,405
Because you need to do, you need
to have the governance layer.

448
00:33:48,765 --> 00:33:52,185
You need to ensure that you
know exactly what kind of data

449
00:33:52,335 --> 00:33:54,545
you have, who can access it.

450
00:33:55,045 --> 00:33:59,065
If you need to be compliant
with different regulations, you

451
00:33:59,065 --> 00:34:00,789
need to understand all of this.

452
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:06,410
This can be achieved only
through a strong data governance

453
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,609
layer, through a data catalog.

454
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:16,109
Azure Purview goes hand in hand with
different data repos and with different

455
00:34:16,109 --> 00:34:22,818
repos Microsoft has, gives you the ability
to do two things, to do the catalogs

456
00:34:22,818 --> 00:34:25,289
and to do the governance of your data.

457
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:34,589
Meaning that you can control and you can
be sure that the AI service and the people

458
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:40,919
that are using your AI are accessing only
the data that they are in the right way.

459
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:47,059
And also, you can track the
level of data accessibility that.

460
00:34:47,554 --> 00:34:50,444
Each flow or each person is access.

461
00:34:50,944 --> 00:34:55,034
Now, again, for the last few
months, we already talked about

462
00:34:55,074 --> 00:34:57,414
that AI is increasing a lot.

463
00:34:57,604 --> 00:35:01,624
Workloads automatically, the cost
can put pressure on other systems.

464
00:35:01,994 --> 00:35:04,914
It's pre translated, but
how you can track that.

465
00:35:05,414 --> 00:35:09,094
And you need to understand exactly
the current spending of your

466
00:35:09,194 --> 00:35:13,164
cloud infrastructure versus The
business value that is brought.

467
00:35:13,334 --> 00:35:18,474
If the business value is high enough,
you might not care about the, your cloud

468
00:35:18,474 --> 00:35:23,984
infrastructure doubled, but the business
value is four times more than before.

469
00:35:23,984 --> 00:35:25,189
This is something that you would do.

470
00:35:25,689 --> 00:35:30,179
How you can implement, the
ability to understand and

471
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:32,889
track and to optimize the cost.

472
00:35:32,949 --> 00:35:38,009
These are true human principles, where
you have three important components.

473
00:35:38,799 --> 00:35:42,709
Governance, optimization,
and strategic alignment.

474
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:49,349
At this phase, I was not able to identify
a tool or a service, only one that you

475
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:51,729
will say that is covering everything.

476
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:53,429
It's usually a combination.

477
00:35:53,899 --> 00:35:56,209
Even the ones that are cloud agnostic.

478
00:35:56,709 --> 00:35:59,979
Even if you have one dashboard,
behind the scenes they're using

479
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:05,719
one or multiple services from each
event or for multiple ways how they

480
00:36:05,889 --> 00:36:08,159
collect, monitoring, and so on.

481
00:36:08,659 --> 00:36:12,699
If we split between governance, cost
optimization, and strategic alignment,

482
00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:16,476
when we talk about government, we
talk about governance, we talk about

483
00:36:16,476 --> 00:36:18,274
management, we talk about meaning.

484
00:36:18,774 --> 00:36:20,284
that you gain visibility.

485
00:36:20,284 --> 00:36:23,394
You understand the cost you have to take.

486
00:36:23,894 --> 00:36:28,764
When we talk about cost optimization
in the space of cloud, we talk about

487
00:36:29,664 --> 00:36:33,406
different ways how you can optimize
the spending, like Azure reservations,

488
00:36:33,406 --> 00:36:39,588
both instances, different licensing,
quotation, but also we are talking about

489
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:46,054
services like Azure Advisor, similar to
it, that can advise you how you can take

490
00:36:46,054 --> 00:36:47,774
different actions, all different stuff.

491
00:36:48,274 --> 00:36:51,084
to be able to reduce your costs.

492
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:58,174
And the third component is strategic
alignment, where tools like Azure

493
00:36:58,234 --> 00:37:07,554
Automation can give you the ability to
have different automated triggers actions.

494
00:37:08,204 --> 00:37:11,964
This can help you to take
control of your spending.

495
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:18,094
Now, we talked about, we talked
a lot about AI, how different

496
00:37:18,094 --> 00:37:19,994
solutions should look like.

497
00:37:20,974 --> 00:37:25,214
I really like this component
diagram of Azure services

498
00:37:25,214 --> 00:37:26,664
that is provided by Microsoft.

499
00:37:27,654 --> 00:37:28,434
Why I really like this?

500
00:37:28,844 --> 00:37:31,434
Because if you take a look
and if you zoom this diagram,

501
00:37:32,364 --> 00:37:35,884
that there are only to OpenAI.

502
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:40,994
Nevertheless, around them, there
are many other services that

503
00:37:41,074 --> 00:37:46,934
needs to be configured, needs to
run, to be able to serve the AI

504
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:50,354
capability that is generated by them.

505
00:37:50,354 --> 00:37:53,774
It's not just putting AI service.

506
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:56,914
And you say, okay, I'm done.

507
00:37:56,914 --> 00:37:58,264
No, exactly.

508
00:37:58,324 --> 00:38:03,764
As when you build a cloud solution,
you don't just put a virtual machine,

509
00:38:03,954 --> 00:38:08,364
put on this virtual machine, the
workload and you say, I'm done.

510
00:38:08,364 --> 00:38:12,514
No, you need to consider all the
other things that are around.

511
00:38:12,969 --> 00:38:22,529
measure a p management or, for the, to be
able to ensure that, you manage the API

512
00:38:22,529 --> 00:38:29,744
you are exposing and you do versioning
of the a p and that are exposing of okay.

513
00:38:29,744 --> 00:38:30,944
Solution that they're building.

514
00:38:31,444 --> 00:38:31,654
You have.

515
00:38:32,154 --> 00:38:37,484
web apps or something else, when
we are, when you talk about how you

516
00:38:37,554 --> 00:38:44,984
can, do some logic around what you're
exposing from the daily service, you

517
00:38:44,994 --> 00:38:49,844
need to do access management and to
ensure that people can access only the

518
00:38:49,844 --> 00:38:54,834
information and the content that they
are allowed through your AI system.

519
00:38:55,604 --> 00:39:00,444
You have the secret, so you need a key
vault or a different flavor of vault.

520
00:39:01,164 --> 00:39:06,154
You need to connect because that
solution don't run by herself.

521
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:11,734
It is integrated in a full stack
solution, meaning that you would need

522
00:39:11,734 --> 00:39:14,304
secure connection with your subnet.

523
00:39:14,794 --> 00:39:19,834
If you go in a hub spoke topology,
then you might have a spoke or

524
00:39:20,184 --> 00:39:24,524
you might define something like
a sub landing without specific.

525
00:39:25,024 --> 00:39:29,824
to how you do the AI integration
on specific applications

526
00:39:29,974 --> 00:39:31,264
or domains and so on.

527
00:39:31,604 --> 00:39:35,034
And then things start to
get more and more complex.

528
00:39:35,064 --> 00:39:39,771
building a cloud solution is not only
about building a virtual machine.

529
00:39:39,771 --> 00:39:42,844
The same thing is applicable for AI.

530
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:48,484
Running an AI solution inside
cloud is not only about.

531
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:51,409
taking an AI service and running it.

532
00:39:51,909 --> 00:39:55,449
Now, let's go with an example,
a very basic one, because I want

533
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:59,573
to highlight what is the process
that we should have in our mind.

534
00:39:59,954 --> 00:40:05,634
When we prepare our
current application for AI.

535
00:40:06,134 --> 00:40:09,484
Let's imagine a traditional e
commerce application, a classical

536
00:40:09,484 --> 00:40:15,234
monolithic one, that was hosted on
prem, and was migrated with success

537
00:40:15,374 --> 00:40:17,303
in Azure Analytics and Shifting.

538
00:40:17,803 --> 00:40:18,863
Everybody is happy.

539
00:40:18,993 --> 00:40:20,813
You bring business to the customer.

540
00:40:21,393 --> 00:40:24,458
consumption is Okay, nobody's complaining.

541
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:25,528
That's great

542
00:40:26,028 --> 00:40:31,503
to be able to connect to services you
need to do, you need to break down the

543
00:40:31,503 --> 00:40:35,893
application into microservices to be able
to scale and to have a better mobility.

544
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:40,288
You need to ensure that the data
storage and the processing capabilities

545
00:40:40,673 --> 00:40:47,228
can support a workflow, can scale,
you, will not affect, affect the

546
00:40:47,228 --> 00:40:51,473
e-commerce platform because you just
started to use the AI behind the team.

547
00:40:51,973 --> 00:40:58,943
you have implemented all the
DevOps practices that are needed

548
00:40:59,443 --> 00:41:06,509
to be able to deploy easily the
AI service, the models, and so on.

549
00:41:06,509 --> 00:41:06,963
And

550
00:41:07,463 --> 00:41:12,902
you can do some recommendations based
on the capability for the users.

551
00:41:12,902 --> 00:41:18,583
Now, to be able to obtain all
of this, you starting a journey

552
00:41:18,603 --> 00:41:19,908
in a modernization journey.

553
00:41:20,408 --> 00:41:24,778
If you take a look, for example, on
cloud adoption and cloud modernization,

554
00:41:25,278 --> 00:41:29,898
is providing for a p and you'll
find that it's very similar.

555
00:41:29,928 --> 00:41:33,708
It is the same route that
gives you scalability.

556
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:34,893
Ensure data.

557
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:38,853
That you have a link for,
analytics for any reporting.

558
00:41:39,353 --> 00:41:44,223
The first part is that is the
microservice architecture.

559
00:41:44,623 --> 00:41:51,023
you're, breaking the, you do
the modernization of your data.

560
00:41:51,523 --> 00:41:55,603
You might go with your data
file factory with fabric, with

561
00:41:55,603 --> 00:41:57,583
startups, or with data lake storage.

562
00:41:57,913 --> 00:42:02,503
It's up to you, but it's important
to do the data modernization layer

563
00:42:02,503 --> 00:42:06,768
to ensure that you have more or less
a link that your, that you have a,

564
00:42:06,933 --> 00:42:10,883
that you have a governance on top
of your data and you have academy.

565
00:42:11,383 --> 00:42:12,813
They're crucial.

566
00:42:12,873 --> 00:42:17,483
Then you need to streamline the
development, testing the deployment

567
00:42:17,753 --> 00:42:22,888
through demo, and also to ensure
that you're using ARM templates or

568
00:42:22,888 --> 00:42:29,733
Terra form to be able to build the
infrastructure that is required for.

569
00:42:30,233 --> 00:42:34,873
The fourth thing is you're in
the phase when you can start

570
00:42:34,873 --> 00:42:38,253
to integrate or AI service.

571
00:42:38,753 --> 00:42:43,113
You might go with open AI, with
machine learning, with Azure

572
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:48,003
Databricks, but it's not only because
this is what I want to talk about.

573
00:42:48,003 --> 00:42:52,133
Here, you start to use a
keyboard, you start to use a

574
00:42:52,323 --> 00:42:53,873
wheelbarrow, something similar.

575
00:42:54,343 --> 00:42:59,123
you put maybe a traffic manager, you
start to create, if you remember,

576
00:42:59,403 --> 00:43:05,193
if you go back to this diagram, you
are starting to build this space.

577
00:43:05,693 --> 00:43:10,753
Until at that moment, in all the
previous phases, you just created

578
00:43:11,573 --> 00:43:18,443
the ecosystem that can scale, that
can run with success, the solution.

579
00:43:18,543 --> 00:43:22,413
And then, you need to think about
operational, you need to think about

580
00:43:23,203 --> 00:43:28,173
monitoring, you need to take into account
how you can have an effective monitoring,

581
00:43:28,803 --> 00:43:34,023
and how you implement all the practices
to be able to track, to be able to

582
00:43:34,023 --> 00:43:35,473
improve performance and reliability.

583
00:43:35,973 --> 00:43:37,173
This is a simplified journey.

584
00:43:37,673 --> 00:43:39,303
And there are three crucial steps.

585
00:43:40,013 --> 00:43:41,933
One is the modernization.

586
00:43:41,933 --> 00:43:49,183
Second is building the AI component
with all the other services

587
00:43:49,183 --> 00:43:50,763
that are required around it.

588
00:43:51,263 --> 00:43:56,891
And the third one is the operational part,
not only of your solution, it already

589
00:43:56,891 --> 00:44:00,418
should exist, but also of your AI part.

590
00:44:00,918 --> 00:44:01,298
Now,

591
00:44:01,798 --> 00:44:07,728
if we do a step back and we would
have or issue today's session, I would

592
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:11,698
say that there are nine components
that I would like to, we are talking

593
00:44:11,738 --> 00:44:14,128
about and we need architecture.

594
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:19,356
We need to be able to have a dynamic
scaling, meaning service computing.

595
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:25,438
We need data lake, data
catalog, data modernization.

596
00:44:25,938 --> 00:44:29,548
We need to implement principles.

597
00:44:30,048 --> 00:44:36,738
We, we need to ensure that also we have an
event driven approach for data processing.

598
00:44:37,468 --> 00:44:37,648
For

599
00:44:38,148 --> 00:44:41,978
other models, especially the
pre-trained one, we can find a

600
00:44:41,978 --> 00:44:43,868
lot on the market and services.

601
00:44:44,228 --> 00:44:45,428
This one might be a good option.

602
00:44:45,928 --> 00:44:52,478
Security compliancy are important,
and in the end, we need the

603
00:44:52,478 --> 00:44:54,488
right observability layer, level.

604
00:44:54,988 --> 00:45:02,568
What are the final thoughts, for my,
for this session is that AI is part

605
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:06,408
of our life for a few years, not
something that started 200 years ago.

606
00:45:06,908 --> 00:45:12,748
We should expect that, AI services will be
integrated and will be part of our lives.

607
00:45:13,258 --> 00:45:19,298
Most of the softwares and digital
services and, think about co pilot.

608
00:45:19,798 --> 00:45:20,718
It's in our part.

609
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,990
What do you say?

610
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:23,567
Word.

611
00:45:23,567 --> 00:45:26,448
There are other services, like

612
00:45:26,948 --> 00:45:28,508
AI, all around us.

613
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:32,708
And to be able to use it, to be
able to integrate it, we need to

614
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:36,718
ensure that we do the optimisation
exercise of the cloud system.

615
00:45:37,398 --> 00:45:42,483
We do the right modernisation to be
able to handle the workload, the payload

616
00:45:42,483 --> 00:45:49,768
that AI generated and best practices
that we were ignoring in the cloud space

617
00:45:49,768 --> 00:45:52,073
until now, nowadays, become mandatory.

618
00:45:52,073 --> 00:45:58,275
event driven approach, data driven,
and real time analytics are part

619
00:45:58,275 --> 00:46:01,094
of the modernization path that

620
00:46:01,594 --> 00:46:05,184
we need to take to be able to
ensure that we are building a

621
00:46:05,684 --> 00:46:11,384
cloud solution that can use Be used
and communicate with a service.

622
00:46:11,884 --> 00:46:12,344
Thank you.

623
00:46:12,844 --> 00:46:13,874
Thank you for joining me.

624
00:46:14,834 --> 00:46:20,624
If you have questions, also, you
can reach me later on LinkedIn.

625
00:46:21,124 --> 00:46:27,144
And thank you for the team
that organized this event.

626
00:46:27,144 --> 00:46:30,854
And thank you for you that you join.

627
00:46:31,354 --> 00:46:33,584
Thank you and have a great day.
