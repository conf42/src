1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,050
Hello everyone and thank
you for joining me today.

2
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:07,999
It's truly an honor to be here
at conference 42 ml Ops 2025.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,100
Let's start this.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,210
Start with my introduction.

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:16,320
This is NA ti and I'm currently working at
State Sheet Financial Corporation and I'm

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,720
bring with me over 19 years of experience
in FinTech technologies, specializing

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,580
in digital transformation, system
modernization and regulatory compliance.

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,740
So in this session, I'm excited
to share, insert some, how we can

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:36,459
architect responsible AI at scale,
particularly in a highly regulated

10
00:00:36,459 --> 00:00:37,809
world of financial services.

11
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,319
So financial services is an industry
where innovation must always be

12
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:45,184
balanced with trust and compliance.

13
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,809
So the big question is how we bring
the cutting edge AI into this space.

14
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:54,379
Without compromising on
responsible responsibility.

15
00:00:55,309 --> 00:01:00,319
So for our next 15, 20 minutes,
we will unpack that together.

16
00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:02,349
So let's begin with some context.

17
00:01:02,849 --> 00:01:05,399
The AI revolution in financial services.

18
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:12,274
We are in the middle of AI revolution
in finance, but by 2029, the global.

19
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:17,214
AI in FinTech revenue is
projected to exceed $61 billion.

20
00:01:17,714 --> 00:01:20,654
That tells us AI is no
longer an experiment.

21
00:01:21,154 --> 00:01:24,575
It's becoming the backbone of how
financial institutions operate.

22
00:01:25,075 --> 00:01:28,554
So nowadays, the banks are investing
heavily in machine learning

23
00:01:28,554 --> 00:01:33,505
pipelines, explainable models
and complaints, first workflows.

24
00:01:34,255 --> 00:01:35,725
But here is the reality.

25
00:01:36,225 --> 00:01:40,095
As air adoption accelerates,
regulators are watching more

26
00:01:40,095 --> 00:01:41,355
closely than ever before.

27
00:01:42,225 --> 00:01:45,705
So the challenge is not just
building high performing models,

28
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:51,665
it's building models that are
trustworthy, explainable, and auditable.

29
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:56,555
And this is where MLO Mops
becomes absolutely essential.

30
00:01:57,055 --> 00:01:58,584
So let us jump into the agenda.

31
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:02,905
For today's stock, and here is
how I structure today's stock.

32
00:02:03,405 --> 00:02:07,294
We will start with the fundamentals
of ML ops in FinTech and the unique

33
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,884
challenges the industry faces.

34
00:02:09,874 --> 00:02:14,810
Then I will walk through some
high impact AI applications that

35
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:16,690
are transforming finance today.

36
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,679
From there.

37
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:23,699
We'll explore how financial institutions
are architecting complaint ML platforms.

38
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:30,569
And finally, I'll share best practices
that leading organizations are adapting.

39
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:36,709
By the end of this talk, you will
see why ML Ops is not optional in

40
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:42,709
financial services anymore, but it's the
backbone of scaling AI responsibility.

41
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:46,059
So ML ops as the backbone.

42
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:52,029
So when people hear the term ML ops,
they often think that basically think

43
00:02:52,029 --> 00:02:54,519
about pipelines and our automation.

44
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,269
But in finance it's much bigger than that.

45
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:04,549
So automation ensures that every model
is reproducible with a clear audit trial.

46
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:05,559
Monitoring.

47
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:10,329
Monitoring keeps an eye on models
in real time, detecting drift

48
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:13,779
or anomalies before any cause.

49
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:14,229
Damage.

50
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:20,219
Governance adds, checks and balances,
ensuring approvals, documentation, and

51
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:22,049
complaints are part of the process.

52
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:23,569
And explainability.

53
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:26,269
This is critical in finance.

54
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:28,069
You can't deny someone a mortgage.

55
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:31,359
Flag a fraud case without
being able to explain why.

56
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:37,199
So without transparency, you risk
both the trust and regulatory ities.

57
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:43,579
So ML Ops is not just a technical
discipline, it's the A, it's a very

58
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:48,909
framework that makes responsible
AI possible in financial services.

59
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:52,189
So let us discuss the challenges
in financial services.

60
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:53,499
By using ai.

61
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:55,499
Of course, none of these comes easy.

62
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:01,069
On the technical side, we face
real time processing demands.

63
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:05,769
Fraud detection systems, for example,
can't be delayed even by a second.

64
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:10,309
Integration with the legacy systems
make this even harder, and all of

65
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:14,449
this happens while we are handling
some of the most sensitive personal

66
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:16,159
and financial data imaginable.

67
00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:18,849
So on the regulatory side,
the bar is even higher.

68
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:25,800
So studies shows that nearly 60% of models
still exhibit by us regulatory requires

69
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,440
complete audit trials for every decision,
and they expect rigorous validation before

70
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,265
models go live for global institutions.

71
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:40,930
Complaint is not just one f. It's many
from GDPR in Europe to CCPA in California,

72
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,050
plus some sector specific banking laws.

73
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:49,290
So building in building AI in finance
is building an aircraft engine.

74
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,270
You need precision, safety and
accountability at every step.

75
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,640
So let us look at the high impact
applications despite these challenges.

76
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,240
Is already driving major impact.

77
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,450
Fraud detection is one
of the best examples.

78
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:08,030
Modern systems can analyze thousands of
attributes per transaction in milliseconds

79
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,360
flagging suspicious activity instantly.

80
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:17,450
So if you take MasterCard's example,
it uses AI to monitor billions of

81
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,560
transactions daily and reducing
false positives while meeting

82
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,850
global compliance requirements.

83
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:26,020
That's a great example of
responsible AI at scale.

84
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,460
Risk modeling and credit
scoring are also being reshaped.

85
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,920
JP Morgan Ha.

86
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,110
JP Morgan Chase has used advanced
ML to strengthen credit scoring

87
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:41,690
models and embed explainability
so that decisions are transparent.

88
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:47,660
This helps them extend credit more
fairly while staying regulatory ready.

89
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,400
Compliance is another
area where AI VA shines.

90
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,490
So HSBC, for example, has tested NLP
powered systems to pass regulatory

91
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:03,300
filings, improving accuracy and
reducing manual compliance workloads.

92
00:06:03,575 --> 00:06:08,075
So that's a huge efficiency
gain in a high stake areas.

93
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:10,915
And finally, customer intelligence.

94
00:06:11,415 --> 00:06:15,855
Productive AI can help financial
institutions offer proactive guidance,

95
00:06:16,455 --> 00:06:20,415
even identifying elderly signals of
financial distress before they escalate.

96
00:06:20,915 --> 00:06:23,735
Each of these examples
show the same pattern.

97
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:29,120
Success is not just about
model, it's about the ML lops

98
00:06:29,165 --> 00:06:31,175
framework that supports the model.

99
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:33,655
So next we'll discuss
architecting for scale.

100
00:06:34,155 --> 00:06:38,985
So how do we make as scalable
and sustainable in finance?

101
00:06:39,735 --> 00:06:41,355
The answer lies in that picture.

102
00:06:41,855 --> 00:06:45,595
From an infrastructure point
of view, secure and isolated

103
00:06:45,595 --> 00:06:47,005
training environments are crucial.

104
00:06:47,505 --> 00:06:53,025
Hybrid cloud and on-premise setups
allows flexibility while respecting

105
00:06:53,025 --> 00:06:54,345
data residency requirements.

106
00:06:54,845 --> 00:06:58,055
Containerization provides
security and portability.

107
00:06:58,555 --> 00:07:00,415
And redundancy across regions.

108
00:07:00,415 --> 00:07:04,105
Ensure systems don't fail
when they are most needed.

109
00:07:04,605 --> 00:07:08,925
And operationally institutions are
building human in the loop of workflows

110
00:07:08,955 --> 00:07:15,255
for I risk cases, running rigorous testing
before deploying models and planning

111
00:07:15,255 --> 00:07:19,215
disaster recovery with fallback models
and automating compliance reporting.

112
00:07:19,715 --> 00:07:23,585
This combination of robust infrastructure
and discipline operation is.

113
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:28,280
What enables financial institution
to innovate quickly while

114
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,050
remaining compliant and resilient?

115
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,590
And let's talk about legal guard rails,
but even the best architecture is

116
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,020
not enough without ethics, isn't it?

117
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:42,355
So we know the, we know that models can
be highly accurate and still unfair.

118
00:07:42,855 --> 00:07:46,235
Leading algorithms, for example,
but lending algorithms, in fact.

119
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,940
I been slow shown to
unintentionally penalize 10 groups.

120
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,710
This is why institutions are
embedding ethical guardrails

121
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,300
into entire AI life cycle.

122
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,980
It starts with ethical data practices that
make sure data sets are representative.

123
00:08:03,465 --> 00:08:08,435
It continues with the responsible modeling
where fairness constraints are applied.

124
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:12,085
Deployment is transparent with
documentation of how decisions are

125
00:08:12,085 --> 00:08:17,095
made, and monitoring is not just for
accuracy, it's also for fairness.

126
00:08:17,595 --> 00:08:21,795
So if you look at the results that
speaks for themselves, some institutions

127
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:27,500
have reduced bias by more than 70, 70%
without sacrificing the performance

128
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,660
after implementing this model.

129
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:34,185
So that's a real win for both
business and the society.

130
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:36,305
Now let us look at the data governance.

131
00:08:36,355 --> 00:08:37,285
For compliant ai.

132
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:40,575
Data governance is the
foundation of compliant ai.

133
00:08:41,075 --> 00:08:43,115
Think of data lineage like a supply chain.

134
00:08:43,745 --> 00:08:47,735
You need to know exactly
where each dataset originated,

135
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:51,275
how it was transformed, and
how it flows into the model.

136
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:54,755
Without this visibility,
regulators won't sign off.

137
00:08:55,255 --> 00:08:57,805
So privacy is equally essential.

138
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:02,835
Auto automated tools can detect
personally identifiable information,

139
00:09:03,135 --> 00:09:07,365
anonymize it, and apply advanced
productions like differential privacy.

140
00:09:07,865 --> 00:09:12,155
Data quality must be validated
continuously because bad data equals

141
00:09:12,155 --> 00:09:17,465
bad outcomes, and access management
ensures that only the right people

142
00:09:17,465 --> 00:09:22,290
touch sensitive data with every action
logged far from being a bottleneck.

143
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:27,760
Good data governance actually
accelerates innovation because

144
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:34,360
it's builds trust with regulators,
executives and customers alike.

145
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,870
So the validation and monitoring
bring rigor to the entire ML life

146
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,915
cycle before deployment models, under
undergoes test testing, statistical

147
00:09:44,915 --> 00:09:46,755
checks, and compliance reviews.

148
00:09:47,435 --> 00:09:52,085
The real test starts after deployment
when live data begins flowing.

149
00:09:52,585 --> 00:09:54,655
And here the continuous
monitoring is also a key.

150
00:09:55,155 --> 00:09:58,755
It detects drift anomalies or degradation.

151
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:05,075
Automated response can retrain models,
trigger alerts, or switch to fallback

152
00:10:05,075 --> 00:10:06,935
models before problem escalates.

153
00:10:07,435 --> 00:10:09,205
Complaints documentation.

154
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:14,005
Once a heavy manual process is
increasingly automated, that means

155
00:10:14,545 --> 00:10:19,645
regulators can get full transparency
in minutes instead of weeks.

156
00:10:20,425 --> 00:10:26,185
So one major retail bank saw model
related incidents draw by 64% after

157
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:27,595
implementing continuous validation.

158
00:10:28,315 --> 00:10:29,500
That's the power of discipline.

159
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,020
ML ops.

160
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,350
Now let us look at the best practices.

161
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,140
So what does success look like?

162
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,710
Successful institutions design modular
platforms with the clear separation

163
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,410
of data model and serving layers.

164
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,720
So they use infrastructure as code
to make environments reproducible.

165
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,170
They maintain model, so
every version is trackable.

166
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,660
And when it comes to implementation,
they start with low risk use

167
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,070
cases like compliance automation.

168
00:10:58,445 --> 00:11:02,245
Before actually moving to the
sensitive areas like lending, they

169
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:06,735
develop standardized reference
architectures, create center of

170
00:11:06,785 --> 00:11:11,435
excellence for governance, and
involve compliance teams from day one.

171
00:11:11,935 --> 00:11:15,925
This is exactly how institutions
like MasterCard, JP Morgan, and

172
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:21,235
HCPC have been able to innovative
responsibly while satisfying regulators.

173
00:11:21,735 --> 00:11:22,840
So here the last is very clear.

174
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:30,000
Building compliance in from the start is
far easier than bolt bolting it later.

175
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,500
So now the key takeaways
from this session.

176
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,660
So we will wrap up here with
some key points to remember.

177
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,280
First, ML ops is non-negotiable
for financial services.

178
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,420
Without this, AI simply
is not scalable or safe.

179
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,520
Second one.

180
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:51,545
Ethical AI requires continuous
vance bias detection.

181
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:57,275
Fairness testing and explainability
must leave throughout the life cycle.

182
00:11:58,235 --> 00:12:02,195
And the third one, innovation
and compliance can coist.

183
00:12:02,695 --> 00:12:06,115
With the right platforms,
financial institutions can move

184
00:12:06,115 --> 00:12:08,605
fast and still remain audit ready.

185
00:12:09,325 --> 00:12:12,265
And finally, success
requires collaboration

186
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,605
across roles, which includes.

187
00:12:15,295 --> 00:12:20,245
Data scientists, engineers,
compliance officers, and business

188
00:12:20,245 --> 00:12:21,955
stakeholders must all work together.

189
00:12:22,455 --> 00:12:27,515
So responsible AI is not just technical
goal, it's an organizational commitment.

190
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:30,325
So that brings us to closing this talk.

191
00:12:30,685 --> 00:12:33,205
And thank you very much for
spending your time with me today.

192
00:12:34,015 --> 00:12:38,485
I hope this session has shown
you why ML Ops is the backbone of

193
00:12:38,485 --> 00:12:40,435
responsible AI in financial services.

194
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:46,630
And how institutions can invo innovate
while staying compliant and trustworthy.

195
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,580
If you would like to continue the
conversation or share your own

196
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,230
challenges, please feel free to connect
with me, and I would like to thank

197
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:00,000
everyone once again, and I wish you
success in building AI that's not

198
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,220
only powerful, but also responsible.
