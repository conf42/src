1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,980
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:03,300
My name is Oriaki Victor Nsakai.

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,149
I'm a design engineer by profession.

4
00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:09,869
today I'll be talking about,
securing embedded systems in

5
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:12,609
IoT, a practical DevOps approach.

6
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:14,859
Now let's dive right into it.

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:17,939
firstly, I'm going to talk
about, I'm going to talk about

8
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,119
what is IoT on embedded systems.

9
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:24,269
then I'm going to talk about
security challenges with them.

10
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:28,539
Then we'll move on to the role of
DevOps in securing embedded systems.

11
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:33,149
And we'll talk about securing
the development, life cycle.

12
00:00:34,139 --> 00:00:37,709
And so we'll talk about, securing
post deployment IoT devices,

13
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:40,910
balancing innovation, securely.

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,620
And lastly, we'll talk about the best
practices for securing these, embedded

15
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,659
devices, practical take home, take homes.

16
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:49,979
Now, what are these embedded, devices?

17
00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:53,119
Now, these embedded devices, they
are like the brain behind what modern

18
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,089
robotics and IoT applications do.

19
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:59,269
they work silently to perform
specific tasks within larger systems.

20
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,509
they are like the brain, behind this, this
modern technology, these smart systems.

21
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:09,799
Yeah, they find applications
in, in headscale sector, in the

22
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,059
manufacturing sector, even critical
infrastructures like the railway

23
00:01:13,059 --> 00:01:15,549
systems, power grids, smart grids.

24
00:01:16,449 --> 00:01:24,719
this IoT, device is expected to grow to
over 25 billion users by the year 2020.

25
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:28,339
Now, we've talked about embedded,
so now let's talk about IoT.

26
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:32,238
IoT refers to a network of interconnected
physical devices embedded with sensors,

27
00:01:32,238 --> 00:01:35,811
software, and other technologies that
enable them to collect, exchange,

28
00:01:35,841 --> 00:01:37,751
and add on data over the internet.

29
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:42,931
basically, this is IOT, system, they
collect data, they exchange the data, and

30
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:44,521
they add on this data over the Internet.

31
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:49,811
for example, in the healthcare sector,
these IOT, embedded devices could be used

32
00:01:49,821 --> 00:01:52,231
to, monitor and track a patient's health.

33
00:01:52,731 --> 00:01:59,241
in my patient sector, it could be used to,
to manipulate robots, to be used for the

34
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:04,981
supply chain to check the movement of, the
movement of, goods from one, production

35
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:07,431
cycle or production, desk to nest.

36
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:12,321
because we use, it can be applied, be
used in our homes to control thermostats.

37
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:15,071
control some devices in our home.

38
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:19,831
So these devices are widely
used in various industries.

39
00:02:20,331 --> 00:02:22,811
Now, what are the security
challenges with these devices?

40
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:27,891
we have, different levels, from the
hardware level risk we have, where

41
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:32,981
attackers can be exploited, by trying
to physically tamper with these devices.

42
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:38,856
for example, an IOT embedded
camera can be, an IOT embedded

43
00:02:38,906 --> 00:02:40,326
camera can be, tampered with.

44
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,476
a circuit could be plugged into
it and, sensitive data could be

45
00:02:43,476 --> 00:02:46,466
exploited or gained from this, device.

46
00:02:47,226 --> 00:02:50,030
Also, we have the firmware
and software vulnerabilities,

47
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,501
things like updated firmware.

48
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:57,961
software, weak encryption, if not
properly, secured, or if not properly,

49
00:02:58,001 --> 00:03:03,111
if not regularly updated, it's going to
be exploited by these cyber attackers.

50
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:06,151
also we have the communication
protocol weaknesses.

51
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:10,631
These IoT embedded devices, they rely
heavily on, communication protocols

52
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:11,771
like the Wi Fi and Bluetooth.

53
00:03:12,331 --> 00:03:13,661
So if not properly secured.

54
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:18,971
It could be, intercepted
by this cyber attackers.

55
00:03:19,471 --> 00:03:23,921
Now, what's the role from DevOps
in security and business systems?

56
00:03:23,941 --> 00:03:26,941
Now we're talking about security
and we want to talk about how

57
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:30,921
DevOps could be used to secure
these devices on these systems.

58
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:37,041
So DevOps is, a combination of,
a combination of development and

59
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,241
operations through automation.

60
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:44,481
so with DevOps, we can ensure
software is prepared and,

61
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:46,901
deliver efficiently and securely.

62
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:53,141
Also applying these DevOps principles
to embedded systems can help improve

63
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:56,251
security, agility, and automation.

64
00:03:56,751 --> 00:03:58,291
Now let's talk about benefits.

65
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:02,531
So some of the benefits include
the real time detection of

66
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:04,101
security vulnerabilities.

67
00:04:04,591 --> 00:04:08,121
So with DevOps, we could
continuously monitor these systems.

68
00:04:08,131 --> 00:04:11,511
So vulnerabilities have been exploited.

69
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:16,231
Also, we have automated security
testing to ensure security validation

70
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:18,591
is part of the CICD pipeline.

71
00:04:19,441 --> 00:04:23,811
so an example could be, we could
use automated testing tools to,

72
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:25,661
automated testing tools in DevOps.

73
00:04:25,971 --> 00:04:31,151
Pipelines to simulate, attacks
on these IOT devices to find

74
00:04:31,231 --> 00:04:33,041
vulnerabilities even before deployment.

75
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:39,751
So, lastly, the another benefit
of this, this another benefit of

76
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:44,501
DevOps in, in securing embedded
systems is faster issue resolution.

77
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:49,281
So this, because it's an automated
process, it's, it responds

78
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:51,701
fast and it detects, this.

79
00:04:52,201 --> 00:04:56,411
vulnerability flows, on time
through this automated processes.

80
00:04:56,911 --> 00:04:59,761
Now securing the development life cycle.

81
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:05,301
Now we need to, we need to secure these
devices from the design stage, not

82
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:08,601
after deployment or during maintenance.

83
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:12,631
So we could use, We could
use, communications that are

84
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:15,951
encrypted, like the TLS protocol.

85
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:21,241
We could also use, secure booting
methods, to ensure that, only trusted

86
00:05:21,251 --> 00:05:25,011
software, ensure these devices
start with only trusted, software.

87
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:30,741
Also, we could use, the trusted platform
modules to protect hardware integrity.

88
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:32,066
All right.

89
00:05:32,336 --> 00:05:37,496
We could secure this, design to get
the design of this embedded systems

90
00:05:37,526 --> 00:05:41,956
during the development lifecycle is
by ensuring security is validated

91
00:05:42,256 --> 00:05:44,286
at every stage of the process.

92
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:48,731
So from the design to the deployments
to demand, you want your methodology.

93
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:52,691
Maintainers, excuse me, even during
maintainers we could, we could secure

94
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:54,991
this, the design of these systems.

95
00:05:55,491 --> 00:06:00,671
Now, even after, after the design
phase of this embedded system, we

96
00:06:00,671 --> 00:06:05,401
also need to continuously monitor
them for unusual activities.

97
00:06:05,411 --> 00:06:09,371
So we could use, things like the
log and alert systems, thereby,

98
00:06:09,731 --> 00:06:14,562
permitted, automated alerts for
potential security breaches.

99
00:06:14,572 --> 00:06:17,732
So whenever there is a
breach we are alerted.

100
00:06:18,402 --> 00:06:24,722
Also we could use a patch management
method whereby we are whereby there's

101
00:06:24,722 --> 00:06:29,712
regular firmware software updates
to patch these vulnerabilities.

102
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:31,662
Also this can be done remotely.

103
00:06:31,722 --> 00:06:34,942
It doesn't necessarily need
to be to involve a human or

104
00:06:34,942 --> 00:06:36,262
have a physical intervention.

105
00:06:36,762 --> 00:06:40,072
I want to talk about, balancing
the vision of security.

106
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:45,492
So while there's an increase in the
use of these devices, like I said, they

107
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:49,122
are applied in various industries from
the healthcare sector to manufacturing

108
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:50,592
sector to critical infrastructures.

109
00:06:51,252 --> 00:06:55,772
we need to also increase the
security of these devices.

110
00:06:56,562 --> 00:07:01,952
like I said, there's an estimated growth
of these devices to, to increase to

111
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:06,522
over 25 billion users by the year 2030.

112
00:07:06,972 --> 00:07:11,422
So ensuring these devices
are safe is very important.

113
00:07:12,062 --> 00:07:15,662
So why is it important
we secure these devices?

114
00:07:15,992 --> 00:07:21,166
So firstly, when we, when we, put, when
we include security features in the design

115
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:28,621
of this, Embedded IoT devices from the
design phase to the deployment phase.

116
00:07:28,631 --> 00:07:31,801
Even during maintenance, we
want to continuously ensure

117
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:32,931
these devices are safe.

118
00:07:33,241 --> 00:07:36,901
They tend to be more trusted
and adopted by the users.

119
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,061
nobody wants to be exploited.

120
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:46,171
So when these devices are safe, we have
more people wanting to use them, wanting

121
00:07:46,171 --> 00:07:48,441
to buy them, wanting to adopt them.

122
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:54,551
This also further, leads to,
open opportunities to new

123
00:07:54,551 --> 00:07:56,021
applications and markets.

124
00:07:56,516 --> 00:08:00,556
So there's an increase in marketability
of these, devices because they

125
00:08:00,556 --> 00:08:02,206
are safe and they're trusted.

126
00:08:02,846 --> 00:08:05,546
They are not easily
exploited by cyber attackers.

127
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:10,656
So by this, we've also increased
the scalability of these, devices.

128
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:15,496
Now, what are the best practices for
securing these embedded IoT systems?

129
00:08:16,176 --> 00:08:21,246
firstly, we need to ensure this,
security is, embedded at each stage

130
00:08:21,306 --> 00:08:26,026
of this development life cycle from
the design phase to the deployment to

131
00:08:26,526 --> 00:08:29,556
post deployment to maintenance stage.

132
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:34,246
So we need to continuously conduct
regular threat modeling and risk

133
00:08:34,276 --> 00:08:40,166
assessments at every given time of this
development stage, the development cycle.

134
00:08:40,676 --> 00:08:45,426
Also, we should ensure we use, secure
communication protocols the HTTPS

135
00:08:45,426 --> 00:08:48,346
and TLS, other secure protocols.

136
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:55,136
Then, we should try and integrate
security testing into our CI CD pipeline

137
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,256
for faster vulnerability detection.

138
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,366
like we said, DevOps responds fast.

139
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:05,856
It detects, Threats and vulnerabilities
early, so we should try and, while

140
00:09:06,136 --> 00:09:09,686
implementing this DevOps approach to
securing this embedded IoT system,

141
00:09:10,456 --> 00:09:15,426
we should try and integrate security
testing into our CID pipelines for

142
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:16,296
faster vulnerability detection.

143
00:09:16,346 --> 00:09:20,786
lastly, we should develop clear
actionable protocols for responding

144
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:22,906
to this, to security incidents.

145
00:09:23,406 --> 00:09:28,476
So by also doing this, practice, we
could secure our embedded IoT systems.

146
00:09:29,206 --> 00:09:33,676
Now, what are the key takeaways
for designers, for systems

147
00:09:33,676 --> 00:09:39,596
engineers, for, DevOps, engineers
as well, or professionals?

148
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:44,336
So the first one is we
should embed security early.

149
00:09:44,356 --> 00:09:49,941
So from the design phase to development
phase, we should Try and embed the

150
00:09:49,941 --> 00:09:52,581
security early to mitigate this risk.

151
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:56,581
Also, we should implement continuous
integration and continuous delivery,

152
00:09:57,081 --> 00:09:59,221
practices for hardware security.

153
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:05,531
Then we could use, the regular
monitor and patch devices, after

154
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:07,381
deployment to maintain security.

155
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:08,531
So even after we've done that.

156
00:10:08,881 --> 00:10:12,281
After the deployment, we should
also regularly monitor our partial

157
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:13,901
devices for vulnerabilities.

158
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:21,551
Then, lastly, we should continuously
adopt these, security, strategies,

159
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:27,211
continuously try and, come up with
ideas, innovative ideas to drive

160
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:29,601
greater use, user trust of this event.

161
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:33,081
Like I said, while there's an increase
in the use of these devices, we

162
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:38,436
need to, increase the, We need to
increase the trust of you to increase

163
00:10:38,466 --> 00:10:43,626
security, thereby gaining greater
user trust and diverse scalability.

164
00:10:44,126 --> 00:10:48,886
So as I conclude today, why there
is an increase in the use of

165
00:10:48,946 --> 00:10:51,766
this IoT and embedded systems.

166
00:10:52,436 --> 00:10:58,411
We need to, try and use the DevOps
approach to, increase our security

167
00:10:59,261 --> 00:11:04,521
as DevOps tends to, tends to
automate its response to attacks.
