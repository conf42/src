1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,180
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,339 --> 00:00:04,189
Thank you for joining this
session on prompt engineering.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,050
As AI systems become more integrated
into our workflows, understanding

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,670
how to communicate effectively with
them becomes increasingly important.

5
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:18,390
Today, we will dive into the
challenges, key considerations, and

6
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:22,980
best practices for crafting prompts
that yield effective AI responses.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,730
Prompt engineering is the practice
of designing and optimizing inputs

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,230
to AI systems to get desired outputs.

9
00:00:30,979 --> 00:00:34,810
Think of it as learning to
speak the language that bridges

10
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:37,369
human intent and AI capability.

11
00:00:38,269 --> 00:00:42,730
Just as we adapt our communication
style when speaking to different people,

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,580
we need to adapt how we communicate
with AI to get the best results.

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,289
Why should we care about
prompt engineering?

14
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,639
First, better prompt leads
to more accurate and relevant

15
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,689
responses, crafted prompts save
time and computational resources.

16
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:04,789
When using commercial AI
services, efficient prompts

17
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:07,049
can significantly reduce costs.

18
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:12,549
And finally, a good prompt
engineering helps minimize risks

19
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:14,559
like bias and hallucinations.

20
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:19,729
We can safely say that it is the art
and science of creating effective

21
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:24,359
prompts that guide AI to provide
relevant and accurate answers.

22
00:01:25,174 --> 00:01:29,954
In any AI application, especially
in conversational AI and generative

23
00:01:29,955 --> 00:01:35,474
tools, a well crafted prompt can be the
difference between a useful response

24
00:01:35,974 --> 00:01:39,064
and one that misses the mark completely.

25
00:01:39,564 --> 00:01:43,964
One of the primary challenges in
prompt engineering is ambiguity.

26
00:01:44,464 --> 00:01:51,184
An unclear prompt can lead AI to respond
in the ways that may not meet our needs.

27
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:53,544
Another challenge is bias.

28
00:01:54,174 --> 00:01:59,764
At certain prompts may inadvertently
guide the AI toward biased responses,

29
00:02:00,264 --> 00:02:02,644
depending on the data it was trained on.

30
00:02:03,144 --> 00:02:10,644
Context dependency means that slight
change in phrasing can alter responses.

31
00:02:11,144 --> 00:02:15,114
Character limits can restrict
amount of context we provide.

32
00:02:15,614 --> 00:02:20,414
And finally, without proper
structure, we might get inconsistent

33
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:22,734
responses across similar queries.

34
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:27,204
Before writing any prompt,
consider these key factors.

35
00:02:27,704 --> 00:02:28,944
What's your ultimate goal?

36
00:02:29,444 --> 00:02:32,594
We need to consider the
audience and purpose.

37
00:02:33,294 --> 00:02:37,894
A prompt intended for technical
users will differ from the one

38
00:02:37,914 --> 00:02:38,794
aimed at general consumers.

39
00:02:39,294 --> 00:02:43,864
Then what does the AI, what
context does the AI need?

40
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,084
What are the constraints
you are working within?

41
00:02:47,884 --> 00:02:52,724
It's essential to recognize the
limitations of the AI, understanding

42
00:02:52,734 --> 00:02:54,644
what it can and cannot do.

43
00:02:55,144 --> 00:02:57,574
What format should the response take?

44
00:02:57,884 --> 00:03:02,414
And importantly, what safety
considerations should you keep in mind?

45
00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:05,804
Here are some best practices
for prompt engineering.

46
00:03:06,304 --> 00:03:08,484
First, use clear instructions.

47
00:03:08,964 --> 00:03:13,764
The more direct you are, the more
likely the AI will respond accurately.

48
00:03:14,684 --> 00:03:17,544
Next, refine your prompts iteratively.

49
00:03:18,044 --> 00:03:23,134
Test and experiment with different
versions to find out what works best.

50
00:03:23,634 --> 00:03:28,645
Testing and monitoring for bias
and sensitivity is critical to

51
00:03:28,965 --> 00:03:31,344
ensure fair and balanced responses.

52
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:37,244
And provide context whenever possible to
narrow down the scope of the response.

53
00:03:37,744 --> 00:03:40,584
Let's look at the best
practices for structure.

54
00:03:41,084 --> 00:03:45,545
While you're structuring your
prompt, start with relevant context.

55
00:03:46,155 --> 00:03:49,935
Clearly state the task and then
specify the desired format.

56
00:03:50,435 --> 00:03:55,285
Whenever helpful, provide
examples and then outline any

57
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:57,075
constraints or limitations.

58
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:02,295
Following this structure helps ensure
clear communication with the AI.

59
00:04:02,795 --> 00:04:08,545
Now let's go over an example of what
a poor prompt is and what a prompt

60
00:04:08,555 --> 00:04:11,955
that follows the best practices
I mentioned earlier looks like.

61
00:04:12,455 --> 00:04:15,935
Here, the user wants to know
how can I improve customer

62
00:04:16,025 --> 00:04:18,125
satisfaction in my online store.

63
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:24,265
While it's clear that the focus is on
customer satisfaction, it doesn't specify

64
00:04:24,315 --> 00:04:30,045
areas of, what areas are of concern,
which leaves the response too broad.

65
00:04:30,545 --> 00:04:35,475
The prompt doesn't specify how many
suggestions are needed or what kind of

66
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:40,555
suggestions are needed, such as whether
they are looking for quick tips or they

67
00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:42,595
are looking for in depth strategies.

68
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:47,345
It also doesn't indicate the
type or size of the online store.

69
00:04:47,845 --> 00:04:50,985
Which leaves the AI to guess
what might be relevant.

70
00:04:51,485 --> 00:04:54,545
Now, what on the right hand
side is the improved prompt.

71
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:59,375
Let's get into the details of how
that prompt becomes effective.

72
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,605
By following the best practices.

73
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:06,365
This prompt specifies that the
recommendations should focus on

74
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:10,255
customer service, website usability,
and post purchase follow up.

75
00:05:10,755 --> 00:05:13,815
It helps the AI target these key areas.

76
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:20,635
It also clarifies that it's for a small
online retail business, which allows

77
00:05:20,635 --> 00:05:25,775
the AI to tailor suggestions for a
smaller team with limited resources.

78
00:05:26,765 --> 00:05:30,485
Requests five concise and
actionable strategies.

79
00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:37,065
By setting expectations for a focused
and structured response, that is

80
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:39,544
manageable for the intended audience.

81
00:05:40,044 --> 00:05:45,464
Now let's look at another example and
compare the responses from the AI.

82
00:05:45,964 --> 00:05:51,544
This is a prompt for creating
emergency evacuation instructions.

83
00:05:52,324 --> 00:05:54,424
The initial prompt is straightforward.

84
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:59,714
But it lacks the specificity needed
for a complex setting like a concert

85
00:05:59,714 --> 00:06:03,694
venue, which is a detail which has
been provided in the effective prompt.

86
00:06:04,194 --> 00:06:09,744
Write emergency evacuation instructions
is a vague request that doesn't provide

87
00:06:09,754 --> 00:06:14,084
any context, format requirements,
or audience considerations.

88
00:06:14,764 --> 00:06:19,484
As a result, the response is too
generic, not tailored for the unique

89
00:06:19,484 --> 00:06:25,154
needs of a large venue, and failed to
account for specific emergency types,

90
00:06:25,314 --> 00:06:27,754
languages, and accessibility needs.

91
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:34,339
In contrast, the improved prompt is
a great example of how incorporating

92
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:38,779
the best practices can lead to
a much more effective response.

93
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:42,199
This prompt specifies the type of venue.

94
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:49,389
A 1000 seat concert hall with multiple
floors and exits, and outlines particular

95
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:54,906
scenarios such as fires, medical
emergencies, and security threats.

96
00:06:54,906 --> 00:07:01,648
It also includes special instructions
for disabled patrons, staff roles, and

97
00:07:01,648 --> 00:07:08,391
event for even format requirements, like
bullet points and universal emergency

98
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:12,069
symbols to ensure clarity and usability.

99
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:17,089
With this detailed prompt, the
AI generated result is much more

100
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:19,649
comprehensive and practical.

101
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:26,864
For example, each emergency type, fire,
medical, and security has clear and

102
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:33,294
concise instructions with universal
symbols and multilingual indicators.

103
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:39,484
Specific assembly points and special
instructions for mobility assistance

104
00:07:39,884 --> 00:07:45,754
and a breakdown of staff roles are all
provided, ensuring that the instructions

105
00:07:45,794 --> 00:07:48,044
are easily understood and actionable.

106
00:07:48,544 --> 00:07:52,694
This comparison shows the
power of a well crafted prompt.

107
00:07:53,394 --> 00:07:57,944
When we are specific about our
requirements, structure, tone,

108
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:03,594
and context, we guide the AI to
produce a response that is detailed,

109
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:05,724
organized, and ready for use.

110
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:12,274
The improved prompt's clarity, structure,
and relevance show how best practices

111
00:08:12,314 --> 00:08:17,264
in prompt engineering lead to much
more accurate and usable outputs.

112
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:20,234
Prompt engineering is
an iterative process.

113
00:08:20,914 --> 00:08:25,284
So start with a basic prompt, evaluate
the response, identify issues,

114
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:27,714
refine your prompt and repeat.

115
00:08:28,504 --> 00:08:33,624
Each iteration helps you understand
what works and what doesn't, which

116
00:08:33,644 --> 00:08:35,794
leads to better results over time.

117
00:08:36,294 --> 00:08:40,474
Use of advanced techniques
can enhance your results.

118
00:08:40,974 --> 00:08:45,664
In chain of thought prompting, we
guide the AI through multi step

119
00:08:45,664 --> 00:08:48,104
reasoning to enhance its accuracy.

120
00:08:48,764 --> 00:08:52,334
It helps AI break down complex problems.

121
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:59,264
Role assignment can help set the tone
and perspective, such as asking the AI

122
00:08:59,694 --> 00:09:02,214
to respond as if it were a historian.

123
00:09:02,894 --> 00:09:04,794
It provides helpful context.

124
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,984
Few shot learning uses
examples to guide responses.

125
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:14,194
By allowing us to give specific
examples within the prompt and

126
00:09:14,194 --> 00:09:16,234
setting a standard for responses.

127
00:09:16,734 --> 00:09:20,624
System instructions help
overall behavior parameters.

128
00:09:21,124 --> 00:09:25,924
Using conditional prompts with
if and then conditions can help

129
00:09:25,924 --> 00:09:28,164
clarify nuanced instructions.

130
00:09:28,664 --> 00:09:33,554
Adjusting the temperature of the model
controls and the randomness of responses,

131
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:40,444
allowing us to define, to fine tune
between creative or factual outputs.

132
00:09:40,944 --> 00:09:44,254
Now let's look at some common
pitfalls to be mindful of.

133
00:09:44,754 --> 00:09:49,074
Even after applying best
practices, we need to keep these

134
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:51,744
common pitfalls in our mind.

135
00:09:52,244 --> 00:09:54,094
First, overcomplication.

136
00:09:54,824 --> 00:09:59,794
Sometimes, in an effort to be thorough,
we add too much detail, which can

137
00:09:59,794 --> 00:10:05,574
overwhelm the AI, causing it to miss
the main point and diluting the focus.

138
00:10:06,244 --> 00:10:09,404
So aim to keep the
prompts clear and direct.

139
00:10:09,904 --> 00:10:12,334
Assumption of knowledge is another trap.

140
00:10:13,104 --> 00:10:17,814
Never assume the AI has background
information or specific knowledge

141
00:10:18,124 --> 00:10:20,924
without explicitly providing context.

142
00:10:21,424 --> 00:10:24,664
Lack of specificity is
a frequent issue too.

143
00:10:25,164 --> 00:10:30,854
Without clear direction, the AI may
provide broad or irrelevant answers.

144
00:10:31,354 --> 00:10:34,384
Unintentional bias can also slip in.

145
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:36,819
Based on the wording we choose.

146
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:43,099
So it's essential to carefully
phrase prompts to avoid the AI

147
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:46,489
going in a biased direction.

148
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:49,079
Ignored constraints.

149
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:54,999
Whether character limits, formatting
requirements, or ethical boundaries,

150
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:59,939
it can affect the quality and
suitability of the response.

151
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:00,369
for listening.

152
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:05,179
So by keeping these pitfalls in
mind, you will be more prepared to

153
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:10,469
create prompts that consistently
lead accurate and relevant results.

154
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:16,159
Now that we have followed all the
instructions for prompt creation, it

155
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:18,439
is important to validate its quality.

156
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:21,179
We start with an accuracy check.

157
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:26,999
Does the AI response directly address
what you are asking for in the prompt?

158
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:31,579
Task completion check is for
verifying that the AI successfully

159
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:33,769
accomplishes the intended task.

160
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:38,979
Relevance checks that the output
is focused and appropriate.

161
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:46,709
Bias evaluation involves reviewing the
responses to catch any unintended biases,

162
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:49,349
which may require adjusting the prompt.

163
00:11:49,849 --> 00:11:52,894
Consistency testing ensures
that reports are accurate.

164
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:57,754
Repeating the prompt yields
consistent quality answers.

165
00:11:58,344 --> 00:12:01,404
And finally, user testing is invaluable.

166
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:07,594
Gathering feedback from actual users
can reveal if the prompt is achieving

167
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:10,264
its intended clarity and effectiveness.

168
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:14,384
As AI systems evolve,
prompt engineering will too.

169
00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:20,419
We will see new capabilities, better
tools, and evolving best practices.

170
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:26,489
The key is to stay adaptable and
