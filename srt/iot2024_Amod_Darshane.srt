00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,050
Hello friends and thank
you for joining me today.

2
00:00:03,949 --> 00:00:10,640
My name is Amod Darshane and today I'll
be discussing a topic on advanced network

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,960
security, network segmentation, and zero
trust architecture and how really it

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,720
helps to secure the IoT cyber security.

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,340
I have about 16 years of
experience in the industry.

6
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:33,214
And I was fortunate enough to
work with various customers from

7
00:00:33,214 --> 00:00:35,934
pharmaceutical, banking, financial side.

8
00:00:36,434 --> 00:00:42,384
At the moment, I am working for an OEM
partner and that gives me access to

9
00:00:43,035 --> 00:00:46,874
multi technology side of the networking.

10
00:00:47,374 --> 00:00:53,154
Traditionally, I was a route switch
engineer, but gradually I started

11
00:00:53,164 --> 00:00:54,984
working on the security side.

12
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,849
And got my attention to SASE.

13
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:04,909
in my current role, I work on projects,
on majority of the projects on SD WAN

14
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:08,339
and SASE, and Zero Trust Architecture.

15
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:15,270
In today's section, we'll go over
some of these topics, how, it is

16
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,210
challenging to secure the IoT networks.

17
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:25,200
And then what is exactly the zero trust
architecture is the network segmentation

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,829
is And we'll go through the synergy
between the network segmentation and

19
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,830
zero trust architecture And how it
is helping to prevent some of the

20
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:43,890
cyber attacks on IOT devices So let's
begin the talk In the next 30 minutes

21
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,470
or so, we will cover these topics.

22
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,090
So what are really the
challenges of network security?

23
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:56,949
With evolving the cyber threat landscape,
the cyber security threats are also

24
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,990
evolving rapidly, with attackers becoming
more sophisticated and persistent.

25
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:08,899
To give you an example, the AI,
Is not really being used to become

26
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:14,069
more productive, in your day to day
activities, but modern day attackers

27
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:21,289
are also getting more productive by
using AI and your traditional, security,

28
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:26,639
traditional security is not really
enough, to prevent these attacks, right?

29
00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:34,199
Especially with the IOT side, which has
which has increased the attack surface.

30
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:37,799
Um, and it has, limited security.

31
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:40,869
built in into these devices.

32
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:46,759
let's take some of the issues with, with
the IOT side of the network security.

33
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:52,609
The IOT is, really lack sometimes,
with the robust security

34
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:54,499
protocols built into them.

35
00:02:55,279 --> 00:03:00,569
their resource constraints, has,
limited processing power and

36
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:05,429
storage, and that really hinders
the advanced security majors.

37
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:11,379
the high volume of devices, also
is a challenge in managing and

38
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:13,649
securing millions of devices.

39
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:15,649
and that is also very complicated.

40
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:22,049
and they are very prone to, malware
attacks, DDoS attacks, and data breaches.

41
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:27,409
Some of the challenges are the
advanced persistent threats.

42
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:29,859
short form is eight APTs.

43
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:35,219
Now these remains undetected
for very long period, of time.

44
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:43,789
It is around nine months to 12, 12 months
before the attacker actually reveals

45
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:50,909
its identity or you as an organization,
identifies that you are under attack.

46
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:52,459
so it's really long time.

47
00:03:53,194 --> 00:03:58,224
And in between, they silently gather
all the information of, from your

48
00:03:58,224 --> 00:04:00,794
database and, they can really harm you.

49
00:04:01,294 --> 00:04:03,334
Then there are insider threats.

50
00:04:03,434 --> 00:04:08,014
the threats are no longer
considered only coming from outside.

51
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,774
They are also inside.

52
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:14,349
for an example, employees or
contractors or even third party

53
00:04:14,369 --> 00:04:21,289
vendors, who has legitimate access
can possess a severe threat to

54
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:24,809
the organization and your network.

55
00:04:25,309 --> 00:04:31,769
Another challenge is to secure your hybrid
environments, meaning now you have your

56
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:38,294
footprint, not only in your organization
and your data centers, You also have

57
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:40,954
your applications running in the cloud.

58
00:04:41,224 --> 00:04:44,524
And not only that, sometimes you
have your applications running

59
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:46,164
in multi cloud environment.

60
00:04:46,804 --> 00:04:54,054
So now you have to mitigate the risk
at the data center level, at the

61
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,384
cloud level, and multi cloud level.

62
00:04:56,404 --> 00:04:58,354
So your monitoring increases.

63
00:04:59,564 --> 00:05:04,644
so these are the security challenges,
to your network and your specially

64
00:05:04,644 --> 00:05:06,564
IoT networks that we discussed.

65
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:09,379
Let's take a look at the other side.

66
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:13,179
So what is exactly the
network segmentation is?

67
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:20,129
so it's basically ice, part partitioning
a network into smaller isolated segments

68
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:27,169
and logically, logically mean you
don't really have, a physical devices.

69
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:31,509
Those are separated, but sometimes
even that is also possible.

70
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:33,339
Sorry for the glitch there.

71
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:38,029
the network segmentation is
basically isolating your network

72
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:42,109
into a smaller, manageable parts.

73
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:49,149
The traditional network segmentation
example would be VLANs or virtual LANs

74
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:57,849
where you segment your network based
on the logical broadcast domains.

75
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:03,109
Another modern day example would be
VRFs or Virtual Router Forwarding.

76
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:08,869
Now that is, very much in
use, to isolate your, guest

77
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,569
traffic from your corp traffic.

78
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:17,509
And also you can, use, your IOT
traffic to, to isolate from your,

79
00:06:17,989 --> 00:06:19,659
traditional enterprise traffic.

80
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:25,429
now you can also have a physical
segmentation of your network, meaning

81
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:31,369
you can have, the, The corp environment
running, in on a different set of

82
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:38,529
network, on a physical device and the
IOT, side of network is running on

83
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:45,179
completely air gapped, environment, so
that is also one of the, segmentations.

84
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:53,019
Now, how it is beneficial, So it isolates
the critical assets, the sensitive

85
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:58,299
data and your intellectual property and
critical infrastructure are separated

86
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:04,409
into secure zones, reducing their
exposure to, broader network traffic.

87
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:10,014
And it also reduce the attack surface,
segmenting the network helps containing

88
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:15,964
potential threats and prevent them from
spreading across the entire organization.

89
00:07:15,974 --> 00:07:20,304
Thank you So if you have
some applications, those are

90
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:23,084
exposed to the outside world.

91
00:07:23,224 --> 00:07:31,035
You can also use a DMZ wherein, those
applications are put behind the firewall.

92
00:07:31,715 --> 00:07:33,015
and then you can.

93
00:07:33,415 --> 00:07:39,505
Only expose certain ports on
or certain, surfaces for that

94
00:07:39,505 --> 00:07:42,505
application towards the outside world.

95
00:07:42,905 --> 00:07:47,885
And that is also isolated from
your traditional corp network.

96
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:53,555
Now let's look at, let's take a look
at, the ZTA, zero trust architecture.

97
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:58,315
zero trust is a security model,
and it is based on the principle

98
00:07:58,315 --> 00:08:00,815
of never trust and always verify.

99
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:00,834
Bye.

100
00:08:01,645 --> 00:08:07,615
What does that mean is, once you
identify a corporate asset or a

101
00:08:07,615 --> 00:08:14,565
user or even a thing like an IOT
thing, then that identity does not

102
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:18,405
remain valid, for very long time.

103
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:23,715
So you always verify that
device is who that device is.

104
00:08:24,265 --> 00:08:28,835
and you always keep authenticating
that device over the period of time.

105
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:36,370
and it also combines with the
authorization, meaning what level

106
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,690
of access that device is granted.

107
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:45,380
if a user or the device is not
supposed to have access to certain

108
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,390
applications, though, then those
applications will not be accessible

109
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,240
for that user or for the device.

110
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,500
And along with that, if, if users,
and applications, or even devices

111
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:04,840
required a certain level of access,
only that access will be provided.

112
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,840
And that comes under the
least privileged access.

113
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,030
Though, they will not be getting access.

114
00:09:10,695 --> 00:09:16,035
Any more access beyond what is really
required to function them properly.

115
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:18,225
and what are the core components?

116
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:24,765
so identity and access management is
a foundation of zero trust, ensuring

117
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:29,615
users and devices are verified
through multi factor authentication

118
00:09:29,665 --> 00:09:31,655
and strong password policies.

119
00:09:32,465 --> 00:09:37,585
Meaning, when you log into
your banking account with,

120
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,295
with a username and password.

121
00:09:39,795 --> 00:09:45,155
The next step of authentication is
going to be either an email sent to you

122
00:09:45,155 --> 00:09:51,165
with an OTP pin or you get a message
on the phone, on a, the OTP pin.

123
00:09:51,665 --> 00:09:56,765
That is another level of security
called MFA, multi factor authentication.

124
00:09:57,265 --> 00:10:02,885
Even nowadays, that is also prone for
certain attacks, but that's an additional

125
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:07,885
level of security that you can, You
can apply, for your applications,

126
00:10:08,385 --> 00:10:12,975
micro segmentation, applying strict
access control policies at the

127
00:10:12,975 --> 00:10:17,545
application level, or workload level
rather than the network parameters.

128
00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:25,505
And then along with these, you continuous
monitoring, or you continue to monitoring

129
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:30,885
the real time visibility into network
activity, And find out if there is any

130
00:10:30,885 --> 00:10:36,965
abnormal behavior or anomaly detection,
and respond to the threats accordingly.

131
00:10:37,465 --> 00:10:41,785
Another example, which is not really
been given in the slide is, the

132
00:10:41,785 --> 00:10:44,105
network access control systems.

133
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:51,315
in my, majority of my, previous,
career or previous job, rather, I was

134
00:10:51,315 --> 00:10:56,945
working on, network control systems,
Where you will be authenticated and

135
00:10:56,955 --> 00:11:02,715
authorized, at the network level, you,
before you can access any network.

136
00:11:03,685 --> 00:11:08,605
And that gives the visibility, what
connects to your wired network or your

137
00:11:08,605 --> 00:11:11,195
wireless network, or even VPN network.

138
00:11:12,155 --> 00:11:19,155
a computer or a user or an
IOT device needs to identify.

139
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:19,195
Okay.

140
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:26,390
It's identity that could be based on
username and password accompanied by

141
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,430
a certificate installed on the system.

142
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:35,370
And then that will be authenticated
against your Enterprise Root Certificate

143
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,490
Authority and proper access will be given.

144
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:46,980
That entity will be put in to the
respective VLANs dynamically in

145
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,340
order to provide the proper access.

146
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,410
Thank you.

147
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:55,050
Now, in traditional versus modern,
network security strategies, in

148
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:59,530
traditional network security, the focus
is really on the perimeter firewalls.

149
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,340
and then intrusion detection systems,
are also installed separately

150
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,350
or were installed separately.

151
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,850
The antivirus system softwares,
and it really assumes that the

152
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,170
threats are primarily external.

153
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,030
which is not the case
in today's environment.

154
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:20,770
And the challenges include
insufficient internal monitoring,

155
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:25,750
vulnerability to insider threats,
and difficulties in scaling security

156
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,280
for modern dynamic IT environment.

157
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:34,010
In the network segmentation, we saw
that it divides networks into isolated

158
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:40,300
segments to control and monitor traffic,
and hence it reduced the lateral attacks.

159
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,480
it is effective for containing
the breaches, but then it

160
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:49,630
requires complex management and
configuration to ensure that critical

161
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,970
segments are properly secured.

162
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,820
And along with that, the Zero
Trust architecture, it is a

163
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,750
proactive, security model.

164
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:06,190
We saw Never Trust, Always Verify, way
of implementing Zero Trust architecture.

165
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:13,360
It validates users and devices at every
access point regardless of the location.

166
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:20,340
And because of our workloads are
also are in cloud and multi cloud

167
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,980
environments, unlike traditional
models, it adapts the dynamic and

168
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,570
distributed environments as well.

169
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:32,540
Now let's take a look at how the
network segmentation actually works.

170
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,980
We already discussed
about the virtual LANs.

171
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,820
It is a logical segmentation of
networks into, smaller subnets, to

172
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,420
create the isolated broadcast domains.

173
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:49,790
And it can be having its
own security policies.

174
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:56,220
For an example, VLAN, guest VLAN
would be completely separate

175
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,120
than the, corp VLAN, where the
access, is given way differently.

176
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,130
The printers will be provided a
different level of access than your

177
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,260
organization, organizational computer.

178
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:16,090
the next gen firewalls, now for
last, 10 years or so, the next gen

179
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:22,330
firewalls are rapidly increasing its,
deployment, in the modern, networks.

180
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,240
there is a reason why, these
are called next gen firewalls.

181
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:33,650
It not only, detects, capable of detecting
and preventing the attacks at the network

182
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,950
level, but they are now application aware.

183
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:44,320
they don't only, able to put the
rules, the access rules at the

184
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,360
network layer, but then they can
also capable of identifying the

185
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,680
applications and, you can put the rules.

186
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:57,675
on them at the application level.

187
00:14:58,175 --> 00:15:03,325
It also, they also capable of doing
deep packet inspection, rather

188
00:15:03,325 --> 00:15:05,235
than just looking at the IP header.

189
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:10,255
they're also capable of preventing,
the intrusion using the,

190
00:15:10,255 --> 00:15:12,085
intrusion prevention systems.

191
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:16,005
you can monitor the network for
malicious activity and block

192
00:15:16,005 --> 00:15:17,995
it by using next gen firewalls.

193
00:15:18,495 --> 00:15:21,925
Another feature is the
geolocation identifying.

194
00:15:22,475 --> 00:15:23,835
what does that mean?

195
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:30,395
you can now restrict, your applications
to be accessed from certain malicious

196
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:35,175
countries and only whitelist few
countries where you expect your

197
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:36,965
legitimate traffic to come from.

198
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:42,895
multi tenancy, the next gen
firewalls can secure multiple

199
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:46,975
tenants and sub tenants and isolate
the network traffic between them.

200
00:15:47,685 --> 00:15:51,595
they are not just capable
of firewall, right?

201
00:15:51,595 --> 00:15:53,085
firewall features.

202
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:54,145
They're also.

203
00:15:54,745 --> 00:16:01,555
a beefy, a router, you would say,
and they are also, capable of,

204
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:04,355
implementing the VRF features on them.

205
00:16:04,855 --> 00:16:09,905
they can also run the SD WAN on
them, meaning, you don't really

206
00:16:09,905 --> 00:16:15,265
need a separate hardware to run
the, software defined networking.

207
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:20,485
they are, they're capable of, programming,
and giving the greater flexibility to

208
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:24,895
control the traffic management, along
with that, the security policies can

209
00:16:24,905 --> 00:16:30,355
also be managed, dynamically applied
to various network segmentations.

210
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:37,925
the software defined networking, it allows
to deploy the devices, the networking

211
00:16:37,925 --> 00:16:41,515
devices, using just one click of a button.

212
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:47,515
they also call ZTPs or Zero Trust
Provision Provisioning Systems where a

213
00:16:47,515 --> 00:16:56,185
system gets an IP address from a DHCP
server and then it's called home to get

214
00:16:56,225 --> 00:17:01,185
the certificates and the configuration
from the controller and then it

215
00:17:01,215 --> 00:17:06,695
configures on its own using the policies
and the configuration that is, It is

216
00:17:06,705 --> 00:17:09,285
there to be pulled from the controller.

217
00:17:09,785 --> 00:17:13,335
Now let's take, take a look at some
of these zero trust architecture.

218
00:17:14,245 --> 00:17:18,895
now how can you always trust
and never, how can you always

219
00:17:18,895 --> 00:17:21,145
verify and never trust, right?

220
00:17:21,655 --> 00:17:24,295
on the devices or on the users.

221
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:30,010
you, so you can implement some of these,
features, multifactor authentication.

222
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,830
which ensures the users, who
they say they are, but required

223
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,690
multiple forms of verification.

224
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:44,490
We saw, an OTP pin, or also you can
use, some of the physical devices, which

225
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,415
can, verify your fingerprints as a MFA.

226
00:17:47,965 --> 00:17:51,355
so those are various options
that you can implement, for

227
00:17:51,365 --> 00:17:52,935
multi factor authentication.

228
00:17:53,635 --> 00:17:56,365
another is the single sign authentication.

229
00:17:56,895 --> 00:18:01,515
Now it really simplifies user access
while maintaining a strict security

230
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:07,435
policies, and it is integrated with, the
enterprise systems like Active Directory.

231
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:14,075
So if you have certain applications,
in your organization and you want that

232
00:18:14,075 --> 00:18:17,840
application, Before user access them.

233
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:23,700
You want that applications to be,
make sure the user is authenticated.

234
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:29,570
So the, but then the, the user experience
is such that they don't have to log in

235
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,750
to each and every application every time.

236
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:38,020
So the security token is issued
once they, log in for the first

237
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,240
time and perform their MFA.

238
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:45,870
And that security token is valid
for certain duration of time.

239
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,020
And for all that duration,
all their access is, valid.

240
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:56,400
So they can open, and they can access
multiple applications, of course,

241
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,740
based on their authorization profile.

242
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,760
The next is the Role Based
Access Control, or RBAC.

243
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:10,480
Now, it is really important to
provide, the users with certain

244
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,370
level of access to perform their job.

245
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:18,585
Um, role based access control or
attribute based access control.

246
00:19:18,885 --> 00:19:21,695
Those are some of the acronyms, are used.

247
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:27,105
So organization enforced the
principle of least privileges using

248
00:19:27,115 --> 00:19:29,145
these, using these components.

249
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:36,825
so I, I previously I had given an
example of, network access control.

250
00:19:37,445 --> 00:19:41,075
So by using network access control.

251
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:47,150
If a device is authenticated and
authorized for a certain level

252
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:52,550
of access and, at the end of the
day, it's certificate expires.

253
00:19:53,420 --> 00:20:02,190
So that device will no longer have the
full access that can be, used to access

254
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:08,050
several applications of the organization,
but then it will only be given.

255
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:14,460
access to mitigate that secure,
that expired certificate and hence

256
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,500
will be put into a restricted VLAN.

257
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,300
so that's the, role based application.

258
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:26,480
basically what it is, the micro
segmentation, the, it ensures the

259
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,180
security policies are enforced.

260
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:33,940
at the application level, and it
allows the granular control over

261
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:39,570
traffic flows, isolating the high risk
application from the rest of the network.

262
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:46,830
we have seen, the example of, DMZ where
you're highly, exposed applications.

263
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:53,840
you would put them in your DMZ and then,
only, open certain Ports or certain

264
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:59,680
services for that application to be
accessed from external, externally.

265
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:04,830
using, next gen firewall, you
can also put some restricted

266
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:11,620
restrictions, on the devices within
the same virtual LAN or VLAN.

267
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,890
so those are, some of the key
components of Zero Trust Architecture.

268
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:21,850
Now, let's see the synergy between
the network segmentation and the ZTA.

269
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:26,640
these terms are coming over and
over, in my presentation, but

270
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:29,080
those are really important ones.

271
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,750
So they complement, security strategies.

272
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:40,660
They help you simplify the compliance, and
help you, their, help you, To, their, the,

273
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:49,650
compliances like GDPR and HIPAA, because
of their, easy deployment, the security

274
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:57,970
posture is also increase, increases
the scalability that is required for

275
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:05,660
the modern IOT networks, and workloads
that also, achievable because of, using

276
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:11,110
the ZTA and, the network segmentation
and of course the business continuity.

277
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,150
It ensures the uninterrupted operations.

278
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:18,640
even during the incidents,
because you can implement these

279
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,220
in a high available manner.

280
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,450
so again, the segmentation
alone doesn't solve the problem

281
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,120
of identity verification.

282
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:34,910
it requires the ZTA to ensure that
even the trusted network segments,

283
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:40,790
users, and devices are authenticated
at every stage and authorization

284
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,870
follows by the authentication.

285
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:48,410
and Zero Trust Architecture complements
segmentation by providing dynamic

286
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,540
and flexible access policies.

287
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:54,260
and the key word here is dynamic because.

288
00:22:54,885 --> 00:22:59,525
You don't put the access policies,
at once, they are always gets

289
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:05,145
changed based on, based on the
users or devices, compliance.

290
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:07,145
So that is very important here.

291
00:23:07,645 --> 00:23:12,455
Now, one of the benefits of,
network segmentation and, and ZTA.

292
00:23:12,955 --> 00:23:15,955
So it offers the
comprehensive security, right?

293
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:19,485
So it delivers the multi layer defense.

294
00:23:19,985 --> 00:23:27,425
it reduces the risk of lateral movement,
meaning, your attack surface is or attack

295
00:23:27,435 --> 00:23:33,875
is not only happening the northbound, but
it can also be east west communication

296
00:23:34,225 --> 00:23:42,185
or an employees or internal employees can
also be present that threat, any phishing

297
00:23:42,205 --> 00:23:48,685
email that, that is open, the attack
can be, unleashed on your organization.

298
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:55,305
And, present by, by, implementing
the ZTA and network segmentation,

299
00:23:55,755 --> 00:23:59,405
the lateral movements can be
detected and be prevented.

300
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:03,285
it also improves the
visibility and monitoring.

301
00:24:03,585 --> 00:24:04,175
so with.

302
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:10,210
The network segmentation organization
can, monitor traffic flow between segments

303
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,770
quickly and detect the potential breaches.

304
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:19,280
it also observes the behavior
of that user or of that device.

305
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:25,050
So for an example, if your printer,
is only supposed to talk to a print

306
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:31,830
server or some of the monitoring
systems, and suddenly it starts talking

307
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:37,660
to an external DNS server, for, or
try to access some malicious sites,

308
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,890
there is a red flag right there.

309
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:46,670
And that can be easily,
found out by using the ZTA.

310
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:52,930
And, which ensures, the behavior is
constantly analyzed for anomalies and,

311
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,270
enabling early detection of the threats.

312
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:59,470
Now, where you all, where can
be, can this be implemented?

313
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:03,550
It, these can be implemented
in smart manufacturing plants.

314
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:08,380
and, malware spreading
through an IoT sensors.

315
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:16,480
Can be easily identified and detected
and prevented, segmented IOT devices into

316
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:23,290
VLANs and segmented zero trust policies
for access control, healthcare facilities.

317
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:29,270
the issue could be like unauthorized
access to medical IOT devices and

318
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:34,210
the solution is going to be, Use the
network segmentation for devices,

319
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,900
and implement the ZTA for the secure
authentication and authorization

320
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,280
in order to, implement
these, security components.

321
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:49,580
it's very important to identify
the critical assets, that you

322
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:53,300
have in your organization and
group the group them logically.

323
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,290
there has to be a single source
of truth, That can be used

324
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,200
to, to verify your, inventory.

325
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:09,110
the audit needs to be taken annually,
and then accordingly, you can, you can

326
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:16,600
enhance your security posture and identify
the vulnerabilities, amongst them.

327
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,800
Now, let's take a look at the conclusion.

328
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:25,690
So for over 30 minutes, I have
been discussing with you, on the

329
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:28,070
ZTA and the network segmentation.

330
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,730
So these are, these tools are really
powerful and complimentary security

331
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:38,500
strategies that enhance protection
against modern cyber threats.

332
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,810
By implementing network segmentation,
organizations can isolate sensitive

333
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:51,300
areas while Zero Trust policies
continuously verify access, ensuring

334
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,160
a more robust security posture.

335
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:59,260
And to get started, organizations
should conduct a network assessment,

336
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,875
apply Zero Trust principles to
critical applications, and continuously

337
00:27:04,885 --> 00:27:10,225
monitor and adapt security measures
using AI and behavioral analytics.

338
00:27:10,725 --> 00:27:14,865
I would like to thank you for,
being with me and patiently,

339
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:17,575
listening to the, to the talk.

340
00:27:18,075 --> 00:27:20,335
and again, thank you signing off.
