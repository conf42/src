1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,630
Good morning, good afternoon, and
good evening wherever you are.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,100
My name is Rashma.

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,709
Thanks for joining me while I talk about
application modernization, if you are

5
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:14,430
the one who is already working on any
of the legacy applications like ier,

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,509
IBMI, or IBM mainframes, or you are.

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,530
Start working on one of these
applications, then you're in the

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,680
right place because in the next
couple of minutes we'll be talking

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,889
about what are these, legacy
applications, why do we care about

10
00:00:28,889 --> 00:00:30,660
modernizing these legacy applications?

11
00:00:30,974 --> 00:00:33,644
What are the various approaches
or strategies and what are the

12
00:00:33,644 --> 00:00:37,815
various trends to modernize
these legacy applications also?

13
00:00:38,095 --> 00:00:41,374
after we, complete this presentation,
if you have any questions, you can

14
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:45,514
please feel free to shoot an email
to Arch in the new arch gmail.com.

15
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:50,175
All right, so let's dive in, to
see how we can transform really,

16
00:00:50,255 --> 00:00:51,725
these legacy applications.

17
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,045
We'll jump into the presentation.

18
00:00:53,545 --> 00:00:53,875
All right.

19
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,605
So application modernization.

20
00:00:56,605 --> 00:01:00,610
We still, see this as a very critical
imperative for so many enterprises as

21
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:05,280
we, seek to maintain the competitive
advantage in an increasingly digital

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,630
business landscape, you do not believe,
approximately 72% of enterprises

23
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:14,380
are actively trying to modernize
their applications with 28% of

24
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,330
them are still in planning stages.

25
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,890
And today, organization implementing
successful modern initiatives have

26
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,530
experienced 40% increase in operation
efficiency and a 38% improvement

27
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:27,970
in customer satisfaction rates.

28
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,740
And definitely I would also mention
this organizations though, that are

29
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,860
not planning, modernization as part of
their investments, they tremendously

30
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,020
spend between 60 to 80% of their budget
still maintaining, their existing

31
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,180
applications, but not on the renovations.

32
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,990
Let's see the current state
of these legacy applications.

33
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,080
when you say current state of these
legacy applications, Sometimes we hear

34
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,410
that, people say legacy applications,
but we still tend to use many of

35
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,620
these applications for our critical
day-to-day business operations.

36
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,400
Though they, they claim themselves
like they're still functional.

37
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,770
We, we still want to continue because.

38
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,014
These business operations are so
critical for their existing business.

39
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:09,710
and it is.

40
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,110
and if I try to change any of
these things, I will have a fear

41
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,790
that, okay, what will happen?

42
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,890
Will it disrupt my today's business?

43
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,350
So likewise, likewise, many
companies today, they're still

44
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,000
continuing their legacy applications.

45
00:02:23,335 --> 00:02:26,915
thinking that if I try to change
this, I may end up in some state

46
00:02:26,915 --> 00:02:30,965
of disruption, but we still, try
to see some of the challenges.

47
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:35,655
For example, legacy applications still
maintain that monolithic architectures

48
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,035
and outdated technology stacks.

49
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,569
And knowingly, unknowingly, we will be
having certain challenges with these,

50
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,390
legacy application architectures.

51
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:49,299
64% of organizations site, they have some,
they have to improve their application.

52
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,749
Maintainability also, they want
to prioritize their, scalability.

53
00:02:54,554 --> 00:02:59,194
This is, these are the two main challenges
we tend to hear from, corporates, in terms

54
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:02,774
of, maintaining the legacy applications
or modernizing these legacy applications.

55
00:03:03,104 --> 00:03:06,644
And what are those key business
drivers, if you want to consider to,

56
00:03:06,694 --> 00:03:08,404
to modernize these legacy applications?

57
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:14,505
Customer experience that is one of the
key driver people will consider to, yes.

58
00:03:14,535 --> 00:03:19,334
I have this issue today and I have to try
to modernize the, my legacy application.

59
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:24,075
And security considerations is
some of these, legacy applications.

60
00:03:24,075 --> 00:03:28,245
Sometimes they, they pose certain
security challenges, which again, is a key

61
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:32,415
driver for the corporates to think about
modernizing these legacy applications.

62
00:03:32,985 --> 00:03:34,605
So maintenance challenges.

63
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,839
And business drivers.

64
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:39,079
And the third factor you should
consider when you want to modernize

65
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:42,500
these legacy applications is the
specific patterns that industry follows.

66
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,210
For example, if you take, health
healthcare sector, they have to strictly

67
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,220
follow their regulatory compliance.

68
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:50,689
certain organizations,
they still follow that.

69
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:54,169
And as part of that, you
should take care of, up keeping

70
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:55,369
your application up to date.

71
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:59,019
like I mentioned, again,
healthcare sectors, they prioritize

72
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:00,669
interoperability, improvements.

73
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:02,550
That is another factor
that you should consider.

74
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,450
Then API first approaches to
enable system integration.

75
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,090
So these are the, this is
the current state where we

76
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,515
have our legacy applications.

77
00:04:12,015 --> 00:04:16,385
today I would like to talk about a few,
major approaches or the strategies.

78
00:04:16,695 --> 00:04:20,754
many of us would try to use, if you want
to modernize these legacy application.

79
00:04:21,234 --> 00:04:24,384
One such approach would be
cloud migration, and other one

80
00:04:24,384 --> 00:04:25,465
would be containerizations.

81
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,369
So we will see what are the strategy
that we have, when we want to employ

82
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:31,469
these, cloud and containerization.

83
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:33,770
So assessment framework, yes.

84
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,090
Whether it is containerization or a
cloud migration strategy, you have to

85
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,520
thoroughly do your portfolio analysis.

86
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:41,480
Why?

87
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,890
There is, as per the research, it
clearly states that, you have made a

88
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,480
thorough portfolio analysis before.

89
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,560
You want to, really start your
journey with this cloud migration

90
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,970
or containerization strategies.

91
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,020
Had it been, any ad hoc approach,
then you wouldn't be really

92
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,530
able to realize the, written on
investment on any of the approaches.

93
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,100
Yeah, container architect orchestration.

94
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:07,210
I'm sure, we would've, here about,
Kubernetes, majority of the organizations

95
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:12,390
today they use is Kubernetes, in terms
of, their production operations with 64%

96
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,670
managing between two and five clusters.

97
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:20,910
So organization with mature T Pro
practices demonstrate a 47% reduction

98
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,660
in application deployment team
and 35% enhancement in resource.

99
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,400
whereas in terms of cloud architecture,
definitely people who, involved, in

100
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,585
this, cloud architectures for, as part
of their legacy application modernization

101
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:39,085
journey, they see definitely some amount
of improvement in application scalability

102
00:05:39,445 --> 00:05:41,335
and decrease in operational overhead.

103
00:05:41,754 --> 00:05:44,874
And definitely it is going to
boost your developer productivity.

104
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:48,530
And also must I must say that it should.

105
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:51,620
It should also show some reduction
in incident resolution times.

106
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,320
So when we talk about clouds to
date, it is essential that we will

107
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,870
be, hosting some of our applications
into a multi-cloud strategy.

108
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,700
So we should also consider, when
I consider these multi-cloud,

109
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,420
strategies, what are the various,
other factors that I should consider?

110
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:13,560
41% enhancement in disaster recovery
capabilities and 37% improvement

111
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,910
in vendor negotiation leverage.

112
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,615
And 49% implementing
geographical service delivery.

113
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:23,055
So all these things, enterprises now
operate in the multi-cloud environ.

114
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:27,615
They have to, take care of these,
parameters, so container security.

115
00:06:27,665 --> 00:06:30,455
if you have chosen
containerization as your strategy.

116
00:06:31,065 --> 00:06:34,545
Organizations definitely must
identify security as their top

117
00:06:34,545 --> 00:06:35,895
container management concern.

118
00:06:36,405 --> 00:06:42,075
So 77% have implemented comprehensive
container specific security tools, and

119
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:47,325
while 84% incorporate automated security
scanning into their security frameworks,

120
00:06:47,925 --> 00:06:49,845
so data operations and storage.

121
00:06:49,965 --> 00:06:53,420
So this is another consideration,
organization should take care where,

122
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,730
they, it is essential for database
and data-driven applications.

123
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:03,760
45%. Currently runs stateful applications
in Kubernetes with, 80% planning to

124
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,560
increase their stateful workloads.

125
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:10,630
So data production emerges as a primary
concern for 54% of the organizations.

126
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,470
So this is about, a cloud
or a continuation strategy.

127
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,970
And what are the various considerations
that you must be taking care of

128
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,655
when you are about to, introduce
this multi-cloud strategy?

129
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:22,545
Okay.

130
00:07:22,965 --> 00:07:26,535
And my second approach, or the strategy
I would say is artificial intelligence.

131
00:07:26,865 --> 00:07:31,605
So if I'm not still talking about
artificial intelligence, then I'm not, I'm

132
00:07:31,605 --> 00:07:35,965
nowhere in this, in the competition today
who is not using artificial intelligence.

133
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:36,355
Okay?

134
00:07:36,585 --> 00:07:36,975
if.

135
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,650
Artificial intelligence is so
popular, how artificial intelligence

136
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,340
is going to be, helping me in terms
of this application modernization.

137
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:45,910
Okay.

138
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:50,320
A driven code analysis, cognitive
computing and performance optimization.

139
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:55,790
So in each of these areas, AI is going
to play a vital role, to assist me in

140
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,530
modernizing my legacy applications.

141
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:02,855
Sir. So what, how, and what exactly these
AI tools or ML software is going to do.

142
00:08:03,305 --> 00:08:07,365
So if you look at this, information
here presented, a powered code

143
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:12,045
analysis tool report, a 52% reduction
technical debt accumulation, and a

144
00:08:12,045 --> 00:08:14,895
40% implement in code quality metrics.

145
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:16,335
Absolutely.

146
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:22,540
So these AI algorithms can process legacy
code bases at 15 times the speed of manual

147
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,240
review while maintaining 94% accuracy.

148
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:29,720
So these numbers, out of a research
paper I have, gathered this and

149
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,000
these numbers very much say how much,
a critical role these AI tools or

150
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,510
softwares will play, while you want to
plan your application modernization.

151
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,940
Cognitive computing today.

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,870
So if organizations wants to implement
this cognitive computing solutions.

153
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:49,080
they, they would've realized that a
63% implement in the business rule

154
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,640
extraction accuracy, and a 58% reduction
in system documentation effort.

155
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:58,890
NLP Natural Language Processing
capabilities show a 76% success

156
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,490
rate in converting unstructured
legacy documentation in the

157
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,900
structure knowledge basis.

158
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,530
So this is about cognitive
computing, performance optimization.

159
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,770
Okay, so AI driven performance prediction.

160
00:09:11,275 --> 00:09:15,565
Models achieve 91% accuracy
in forecasting system behavior

161
00:09:15,925 --> 00:09:17,545
under various load conditions.

162
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,040
So organization leveraging these
capabilities report a 52% implement in

163
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,000
resource utilization and a 47% reduction
in performance related incidents.

164
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:31,950
So not only these three areas,
either in terms of testing or data

165
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:36,240
insights, there are like several
areas where these AI plays a very

166
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,050
vital role, and it helps a lot in
boosting your efficiency, in reducing

167
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,320
the time, and the cost, et cetera.

168
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,840
So many ways the A is going
to play a critical role.

169
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,040
like I mentioned, testing
and addition support systems.

170
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,420
So automated testing.

171
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,090
So these AI softwares would really
help people to, to do the test

172
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:59,420
coverage means it really helps us
to, write enough number of testing

173
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,640
cases as given a set of core snippets.

174
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,250
so I really no need to, engage so
many people to write these test cases.

175
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,960
So AI is going to do the job for me.

176
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:13,720
So 78%, it does the test coverage
with 60, 65% less effort compared to

177
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,280
traditional approaches like I mentioned.

178
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,280
So it also reduces the testing cycles.

179
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,560
While it improves the
defect detection rates.

180
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,060
So much automation is in place, so why
not we see this improvement, right?

181
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,240
So improving defect
detection rates by 43%.

182
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:30,095
And pattern recognition.

183
00:10:30,335 --> 00:10:34,915
So AI is so popular, in terms of
identifying pattern, what are the

184
00:10:34,915 --> 00:10:37,375
various, stages or, situations.

185
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:41,755
My system tends to slows down or my
system shows some performance slow down.

186
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:46,865
So those areas, I can very well map
it down and I can have an algorithm in

187
00:10:46,865 --> 00:10:50,925
place to see, okay, these are all the
maintenance schedule, I have to take

188
00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:53,025
care in terms of, maintaining them.

189
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,525
System recover and et
cetera in all those aspects.

190
00:10:56,035 --> 00:11:00,215
So has become, so this a powered,
pattern recognition has become so

191
00:11:00,215 --> 00:11:02,765
instrumental in architecture optimization.

192
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:06,735
So like I mentioned, not only in
this maintenance schedules, like also

193
00:11:06,735 --> 00:11:10,935
architecture optimization, if there is
any repetitive processes or any workflows,

194
00:11:11,265 --> 00:11:15,555
this a really helps in identifying
such duplication or in redundancy.

195
00:11:15,555 --> 00:11:16,635
They can very well help.

196
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,880
To optimize those workflows.

197
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,790
It also improves the decision making.

198
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:26,440
So if you have a machine learning
model, and you can very well use it to

199
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,970
predict the success rate of different
modernization patterns with 85% accuracy.

200
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,940
Data driven decision support.

201
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:39,110
So AI will also help us to, to do so
much data analytics and out of that

202
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,230
it'll help the, top layered, management.

203
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:46,790
Cater people to, consider these
data analytics and it'll, it really

204
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,510
help them to perform some data
insights and to use that further

205
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,640
for, next business, enhancements.

206
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:57,050
So organization implementing these AI
Power Edition support systems report a

207
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:02,450
67% improvement in modern success rates
and a 49% reduction in project risk.

208
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,430
These tools can effectively analyze
complex dependencies with 84% accuracy.

209
00:12:08,155 --> 00:12:08,515
Okay.

210
00:12:08,735 --> 00:12:11,905
in our approaches, the next
one would be low-code and

211
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:13,255
no-code development platforms.

212
00:12:13,555 --> 00:12:16,695
I'm sure you guys would've already
have heard of, these low-code,

213
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:17,955
no-code development platforms.

214
00:12:18,465 --> 00:12:20,025
What exactly you mean by low-code?

215
00:12:20,025 --> 00:12:24,705
No, Today we all, spend so much time
in, in, gathering the requirements,

216
00:12:24,705 --> 00:12:27,825
spending time in drafting the
technical requirement specifications.

217
00:12:27,825 --> 00:12:33,045
And again, after that, people spending
time in, writing, a huge amount of code.

218
00:12:33,435 --> 00:12:39,005
what if I'm given a chance, without,
much code or with no code, I will

219
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:40,655
be able to do all that magic.

220
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,590
That, that is, that, that is why
it, it is, possible through these

221
00:12:44,595 --> 00:12:46,810
low-code no-code development platforms.

222
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:52,360
So as per the research, the global market
is expected to grow at a compound annual

223
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:59,530
growth rate of 28.1% through 2027 because
of the significant benefits to, you know,

224
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,620
through these, local no-code platforms.

225
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,290
Accelerated development.

226
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,100
organizations who are, really
thinking about these, local no core

227
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,090
platforms, they're going to experience
a 65% reduction in the application

228
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:15,200
development cycles compared to the
traditional approaches, cost efficiency.

229
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,810
People who implement these platforms.

230
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:22,325
they achieve, they're gonna achieve 47%
cost savings compared to traditional

231
00:13:22,325 --> 00:13:24,845
development approaches and governance.

232
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:30,005
So in terms of governance, organizations
are going to achieve 62% higher

233
00:13:30,005 --> 00:13:34,995
user adoption rates and report, 44%
fewer implementation challenges.

234
00:13:35,445 --> 00:13:40,485
So training impact comprehensive training
programs result in 57% higher developer

235
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:42,135
productivity with these platforms.

236
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,730
Success factors include the effective
security frameworks, like 73% success

237
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,905
rate, robust training programs,
and integration capabilities.

238
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:57,775
So here I have put few numbers in terms
of specific industry who are adopting

239
00:13:57,775 --> 00:14:02,735
these local Norco platforms, financial
services, 38% of this financial sector.

240
00:14:03,195 --> 00:14:06,735
they're using this LCNC adoption
with Workflow Automation

241
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:09,135
Solutions delivering 61% year on.

242
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,780
Year over year growth and healthcare,
35% of these, healthcare sector.

243
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:20,130
They use these LCNC platforms for
interactive patient engagement, achieving

244
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,950
a 54% adoption across provider networks.

245
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,980
And coming to the retail sector, 27%
of the retail sector, they use these

246
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:32,750
platforms in their omnichannel customer
experience solutions and 40% in

247
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,825
manufacturing sector where they use these
platforms for smart operations management.

248
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:38,145
platforms.

249
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:40,005
Revolution is in production efficiency.

250
00:14:40,635 --> 00:14:44,895
So enterprises implementing these
platforms or these solutions, they

251
00:14:44,895 --> 00:14:48,015
have proved that you know it is going
to have a faster delivery of digital

252
00:14:48,015 --> 00:14:53,145
transformation initiatives with enhanced
business responsiveness to market changes.

253
00:14:53,655 --> 00:14:58,275
Also, they're going to demonstrate
a stronger cross collaboration.

254
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:03,285
Along with that, these organizations
experience a 55% decrease in IT

255
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:08,055
project backlogs and a 39% boost
in innovation capabilities through

256
00:15:08,055 --> 00:15:09,585
democratized development programs.

257
00:15:10,085 --> 00:15:13,365
And the next one we have in
this approach, in the strategies

258
00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:15,015
is microservices architecture.

259
00:15:15,495 --> 00:15:19,405
This is another popular, approach,
a strategy where we use so, so

260
00:15:19,405 --> 00:15:22,845
predominantly when I want to
modernize my legacy applications.

261
00:15:23,415 --> 00:15:24,975
So what exactly is a microservice?

262
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:29,675
So in, in traditional approaches,
I would be having a long services,

263
00:15:29,675 --> 00:15:31,445
our workflows, our processes.

264
00:15:31,955 --> 00:15:35,645
So now as the days evolve, as the
technology evolve, we realize that.

265
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:39,380
decomposing these long written
services into small, in a micro

266
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,950
manner so that, having constructed
all these microservices in a very,

267
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:48,010
communication manner is going to
improve the architecture and efficiency.

268
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,790
strategic decomposition.

269
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,990
So this is what I mentioned, so you
will be decomposing a long, processes

270
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,680
to make them much more easy for in
terms of, communication and efficiency.

271
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,400
So you will be dec decide
deciding a precise boundaries

272
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,230
for optimal service isolation.

273
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:07,370
Also, you will be talking something
about service mesh architecture, where

274
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,670
you'll be streamlining this, interservice
communications, like I mentioned

275
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,030
about, so pattern based development.

276
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:18,890
you'll be deciding or designing a
fall tolerance resilient, mechanisms.

277
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:22,575
for, as part of this pattern
based development and network

278
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:26,805
resilience, robust security controls
and traffic orchestration data

279
00:16:26,805 --> 00:16:30,705
consistency, so scalable event
sourcing and transaction patterns.

280
00:16:31,185 --> 00:16:35,055
So organizations implementing these
strategic decomposition methodologies

281
00:16:35,115 --> 00:16:39,095
achieve a 64% implement in system
maintainability and scalability.

282
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:44,080
the demonstrate superior results, in
terms of like success rate for incremental

283
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,640
monolith transformation teams like
embracing domain driven design frameworks

284
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,900
experience a 47% reduction in cross
team boundary disputes and architecture.

285
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,030
So this is, so service mesh
architecture is, very popular.

286
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:01,290
Like when you implement it is gonna
deliver 58% higher reliability

287
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,030
in complex service interactions.

288
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:08,260
While reducing network related
incidents by 45%, organizations

289
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:13,930
report a 67 enhancement in disrupted
tracing capabilities, enabling

290
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:18,040
faster problem resolution and
comprehensive system visibility across

291
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,785
the microservices ecosystem, future
outlook and digital transformation.

292
00:17:22,285 --> 00:17:23,425
Accelerated modernization.

293
00:17:23,425 --> 00:17:26,725
84% of organizations have accelerated
their digital modernization

294
00:17:26,725 --> 00:17:31,375
initiatives with 67% increasing
technology investments specifically

295
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,175
for legacy application transformation.

296
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:36,955
This momentum continues to build
as a digital transformation

297
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:41,035
becomes a strategic imperative
rather than an optional advantage.

298
00:17:41,575 --> 00:17:42,385
Risk management.

299
00:17:42,565 --> 00:17:45,550
So this is another category,
you have to consider when you.

300
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:49,860
Implementing Structural Risk
Management framework report 70%

301
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,190
modern disruptions success factors.

302
00:17:53,715 --> 00:17:59,205
Include that proactive risk identification
on integrated adaptive response mechanism

303
00:17:59,235 --> 00:18:02,445
across systems technology stack evolution.

304
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:06,945
78% of these enterprises now
prioritize flexible, scalable

305
00:18:06,945 --> 00:18:08,985
architectures as foundation elements.

306
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:13,275
Those embracing modern database
technologies achieve 62% improved

307
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:14,595
application responsiveness.

308
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:20,205
57, 50 6% less data latency
and 51% enhanced systems.

309
00:18:20,205 --> 00:18:24,195
Scalability, creating a more
agile technological ecosystem.

310
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:27,015
So sustainable modern practices.

311
00:18:27,345 --> 00:18:32,115
But sustainable modernization practices
where, long-term sustainability, organiz

312
00:18:32,115 --> 00:18:36,825
implementing sustainable modernization
frameworks achieve a 66% implement

313
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:41,655
in long-term system continuity and
59% election technical declaration.

314
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:47,115
So this focus on sustainability ensures
a system remain viable and adaptive

315
00:18:47,115 --> 00:18:48,990
over time innovation capabilities.

316
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,360
So organization fostering innovation
driven modernization approaches

317
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:58,040
report 16% improvement in feature
delivery speed, and a 54% enhancement

318
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,570
in customer experience metrics.

319
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,160
Innovation has become a crucial
differentiator in modern in sectors,

320
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,020
enterprise risk considerations.

321
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,330
So 81% of organizations now
incorporate risk assessment into

322
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,160
their modernization planning phases.

323
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:16,750
So automated risk assessment tools
lead to 58% I improvement in risk

324
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,950
identification, accuracy, and
better alignment between technical

325
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,140
capabilities and business objectives.

326
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,000
yeah.

327
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:29,090
So this is about, our, various strategies
and trends that we would be, using

328
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,190
to do this legacy modernization.

329
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,470
one final thought I would want to,
present before I say thanks and leave

330
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:41,370
for the presentation is, I really do not
want to enforce that you have to abandon

331
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,180
your existing, systems legacy systems.

332
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,660
it is up to each one of us to
maintain a proper balance of

333
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,370
what are today's business needs.

334
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,810
And if my, today's applications or the
existing legacy applications, though they

335
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:59,590
are called outdated, are they really,
helping me to meet today's business needs.

336
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,810
If not, then I have to see, what
is the, what is the possible way,

337
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,160
what is the most profitable way?

338
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,130
to use the stability and the
enhancement of the existing system.

339
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:13,380
At the same time, I need to modernize in
a way that I have to make use of these

340
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:18,520
latest technologies like, cloud adoption,
microservices, containerization, I.

341
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:24,430
Importantly, artificial intelligence,
so that my application is no more called

342
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:29,270
as an outdated applications because it
has all the latest capabilities, to be

343
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:34,020
in a position to interact with the few
other peer technology platforms, for, to

344
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,530
meet the latest business, requirements.

345
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,590
So of course, another factor we
should consider is the culture of the

346
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,380
organization and customer experience.

347
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:47,585
people who work on these platforms, they
should all feel, comfortable when you

348
00:20:47,585 --> 00:20:52,705
make a move towards this modernization,
I'm pretty sure you have learned enough,

349
00:20:52,735 --> 00:20:57,405
information when you want to modernize,
these legacy applications for the most

350
00:20:57,405 --> 00:20:59,925
business profitability to achieve today.

351
00:21:00,505 --> 00:21:02,130
I hope you enjoy the presentation.

352
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,810
