1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:02,910
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,320
Thank you for being here today.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,910
It's truly an honor to speak on
Conference 42, machine Learning 2025.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,290
I'm D Patel, a seasoned data
engineer specializing in healthcare

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,120
data compliance and analytics.

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's begin with a simple caution.

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,380
What if we could predict a heart
attack, not minutes before,

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,570
but a days before it occurs?

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,700
Thanks to the breakout in AI and data
engineering, that's no longer just a.

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:36,150
Healthcare is shifting from a reactive
model to a predictive one where we prevent

11
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,330
illness before it even occur Today.

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,720
I'll walk you through this
transformation, the technical journey

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,120
behind it, the real world example,
and how predictive healthcare is

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,800
changing the future of medicine.

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,870
So let's dive in.

16
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:57,910
All right, so from data to diagnosis,
engineering, ai, power predictive

17
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:03,340
healthcare system, we are at a pivotal
moment in the evolution of healthcare.

18
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,620
One where artificial intelligence
combined with robust data engineering,

19
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:13,300
is enabling us to move from reactive
care to a predictive system.

20
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,715
This technology allow us to anticipate.

21
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:23,065
Patients need in real time, significantly
improving early detection, enabling

22
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:27,295
timely intervention, and ultimately
enhancing clinical outcomes.

23
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:32,125
In this session, I will walk you
through how this system are designed,

24
00:01:32,455 --> 00:01:37,375
the challenges and the measurable
impact they are already making

25
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:38,605
across the healthcare setting.

26
00:01:39,605 --> 00:01:39,965
Alright.

27
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,730
So let's begin with the healthcare
transformation training.

28
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,890
It helps to take a step back and
look at how far the field has come.

29
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,140
Because the healthcare has been
undergoing a significant transformation

30
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,940
over the past few decades.

31
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:00,470
This transformation can be broken
down into three major phases,

32
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,970
traditional healthcare, digital
transformation, and AI integration.

33
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,840
Let's begin with the first phase,
traditional transformation.

34
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,780
This was the era most
of us are familiar with.

35
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,810
Healthcare was reactive by design.

36
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:21,470
You waited until you had a symptom,
maybe a chest pain, fever, shortness of

37
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,355
breath, and then you went to a doctor.

38
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,280
Diagnosis were based on symptom
patient memory or physical exam

39
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,400
or basis of a test lab test.

40
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,680
At this stage, very little was
systematically recorded or reused.

41
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,850
It was mostly paper-based
and the information rarely

42
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,260
left the physician office.

43
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,470
The role of data was minimal.

44
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:52,490
It showed only an immediate visit and a
long-term trend of across patient insight.

45
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:57,610
Lastly, invisible then comes the
transformation, digital transformation.

46
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,010
This really gained a momentum in 2000.

47
00:03:00,955 --> 00:03:06,925
Accelerated by eruption of electronic
healthcare record, which is EHR.

48
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:12,385
Suddenly we started capturing
everything, vital sign, lab results,

49
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:17,665
medications, diagnosis, progress
notes, and all in a digital format.

50
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,380
But here's the catch.

51
00:03:20,529 --> 00:03:24,999
While we were collecting all this
data, most of our of it went unused

52
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:27,640
beyond billing or record keeping.

53
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:32,019
We had a digital infrastructure,
but we are weren't yet unlocking

54
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:33,790
the true value hidden in the data.

55
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,099
That brings us to a third and
the current phase AI integration.

56
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:41,469
This is where things get exciting.

57
00:03:42,535 --> 00:03:47,394
We now leverage AI and machine
learning to analyze massive amount

58
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:52,315
of health data in a real time instead
of waiting for a symptom to appear.

59
00:03:52,855 --> 00:03:56,965
This model can predict risk
sometimes days or even weeks in air.

60
00:03:56,965 --> 00:04:02,815
Advance hospital around the world are
now using predictive model to flag

61
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:09,505
patient at risk of cardio event hospital
remissions and more even consumers like.

62
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:15,940
Consumer devices like Apple Watch are
entering in the picture, capturing users,

63
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:22,660
heart rhythms, changing, change in the
mobility or, and feeding that data into

64
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,220
a health system for further monitoring.

65
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:30,130
So to summarize this journey, we have
more from and reactive care where

66
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:35,020
we responded to an illness after the
talker to a data reach where we capture

67
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,030
more information than ever before.

68
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,830
And now to a predictive care
where we can use this information

69
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,830
proactively to protect patient
health before it compromise.

70
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,690
This is the foundation of predictive
healthcare, and it's only possible

71
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,440
because how we evolve through
these three clinical phases.

72
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:58,360
In the next few slides, we will dive
deeper into how this is actually

73
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:05,290
implemented from the data pipeline
to AI model and real world impact.

74
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:05,950
It's having.

75
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,370
All right.

76
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,760
First, let's look at the
early detection success.

77
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:17,090
Let's explore what predictive healthcare
really means in practice, because

78
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,720
this is where we begin to see the
power of artificial intelligence comes

79
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,210
alive in a real clinical setting.

80
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,340
AI model with a vast and diverse
healthcare data sets are now

81
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,100
capable of identifying disease risk.

82
00:05:31,475 --> 00:05:35,375
Long before symptoms surface, allowing
the healthcare professional to take

83
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,735
action proactively rather than reactively.

84
00:05:39,695 --> 00:05:44,105
So there are few outcomes that
you can find on Marketplace First.

85
00:05:44,195 --> 00:05:48,965
Research shows 70% improvement in
early cardiovascular risk detection.

86
00:05:49,205 --> 00:05:49,805
This means.

87
00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:53,765
We are identifying high risk
patients significantly, early,

88
00:05:53,915 --> 00:05:57,515
often, while they are still feeling
comfortably, completely fine.

89
00:05:57,745 --> 00:06:02,815
For instance, patient at risk
for heart failure or a stroke can

90
00:06:02,815 --> 00:06:07,825
now be flagged during a routine
checkup or even when a traditional

91
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,355
diagnosis won't raise an alert.

92
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:17,150
Second, on average, the predictive
system provides about a week

93
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,510
or more advanced warning.

94
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:24,910
Before a symptoms actually appear,
imagine what can be done with that

95
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:30,065
time scheduling specialist visit, order
ordering additional test adjusting

96
00:06:30,065 --> 00:06:35,225
medication, or for a cardiac patient,
few days could be a difference between a

97
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:37,715
manageable condition to an ER admission.

98
00:06:39,545 --> 00:06:44,315
Third, the early intervention based on
this insight has resulted in one third

99
00:06:44,315 --> 00:06:46,385
reduction of emergency room visits.

100
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,910
That's not just a
statistics, that's fever.

101
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,960
Patient in crisis, less strain in
emergency department, and better

102
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,490
resource allocation in hospital.

103
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:00,140
It's powerful demonstration of AI
driven, one insight translate into a

104
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,060
real world efficiency and better care.

105
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,970
This is what predictive
healthcare looks like.

106
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:12,350
It's about equipping doctors with timely,
actionable insight, transforming data

107
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,920
into an early warning, and fundamentally
changing the tragedies of the patient.

108
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,690
Patient's Health Journey

109
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,160
Data integration Architects.

110
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,950
As we move towards predictive healthcare,
one crisis critical truth stands out

111
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,210
without a strong data integration
architect, none of this works.

112
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,170
Predictive AI in healthcare does
not begin with an algorithm.

113
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:38,850
It begins with data,
specifically data that's timely,

114
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,260
accurate, and comprehensive.

115
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,395
First, we look at the source integration.

116
00:07:44,205 --> 00:07:47,175
This involves bringing together
data from various system.

117
00:07:48,225 --> 00:07:48,915
EHR.

118
00:07:48,975 --> 00:07:52,365
Electronic Health Record
contains diagnosis, medications,

119
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:53,775
vitals, clinical notes.

120
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:57,825
Variable devices like Apple Watch
or Fitbit contributes continuous

121
00:07:57,825 --> 00:08:03,255
monitoring data such as heart rate,
sleep patterns, even blood oxygen levels.

122
00:08:03,555 --> 00:08:07,815
Genetic testing brings insight
into a long-term risk of a patient.

123
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,440
And a clinical system such as lab
information systems or image archives

124
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,730
brings the picture as a format data.

125
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:25,180
So pulling this data in
only one is only a step one.

126
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,450
The next major phase
is data harmonization.

127
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,930
Healthcare data comes in
widely different format.

128
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:35,950
One hospital might use milligram
per decimal while the other

129
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,920
use melo mile per liter.

130
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:46,450
Even diagnosis score vary from ICD to
snow harmonization, standardized this,

131
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:52,240
align units, terminologies, formats, and
even a, and ensure the consistencies.

132
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,990
Once harmonized, the data is.

133
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:03,790
Is ready for the AI processing model
are timed, trained on this high

134
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:09,880
quality, unified data to learn pattern,
generate predictive health, such as

135
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:15,160
who might develop sepsis, who likely
to be readmitted, or whose condition

136
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,380
is trending towards an acute ation.

137
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,960
The final and the perhaps most important
stage is a clinical insight delivery.

138
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,930
It's not enough to generate a prediction.

139
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,400
We must emel them into a clinical
workflow, whether it's through

140
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,870
an alert in EHR Visual dashboard
or mobile app, inside must be

141
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,180
accessible, actionable, and timely.

142
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,820
The takeaway here is simple.

143
00:09:40,555 --> 00:09:44,395
Prediction is the is only possible
when we integrate data effectively,

144
00:09:44,545 --> 00:09:49,375
and that's only possible when with
a robust data engineering architect

145
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:53,455
isn't just an infrastructure, it's
a foundation of a better healthcare

146
00:09:54,455 --> 00:09:54,665
core.

147
00:09:54,665 --> 00:09:56,105
Technical challenges.

148
00:09:56,345 --> 00:10:01,295
Now that we have seen how data flow into
a predictive system, let's talk about what

149
00:10:01,295 --> 00:10:05,135
can go wrong and what makes healthcare
data engineering uniquely challenging.

150
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,790
Building AI for healthcare isn't as simple
as collecting data and train a model.

151
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,380
We face four core technical
challenges that must be addressed

152
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,900
before we even begin modeling first.

153
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,540
Security and privacy.

154
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,760
Healthcare data is among the most
sensitive information we can collect.

155
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:29,080
Patient trust us with detail about
their body, their mental health, their

156
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,120
genetics, sometimes even their lifestyle.

157
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,110
We have a legal and ethical
responsibility to protect the data.

158
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,760
HIPA compliance isn't an optional,
and yet, AI system requires a

159
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,680
broad access to data to work well.

160
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:48,490
The challenge is enabling access while
maintaining rigorous privacy control,

161
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,190
audit will and encryption standards.

162
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,630
The technique like de-identification,
data masking or federated learning

163
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,100
are a part of the solution.

164
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:01,315
Allow us to train model without
even exposing the raw patient data.

165
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:05,335
Second interoperability
healthcare system are fragmented.

166
00:11:05,575 --> 00:11:06,955
One hospital use epic.

167
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:10,735
Other use corner labs use different codes.

168
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:16,410
Peer use ICD 10 codes and devices
help proprietary format as well.

169
00:11:17,065 --> 00:11:20,815
Without standardization, it's
nearly impossible to combine

170
00:11:20,815 --> 00:11:22,345
data for these sources.

171
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,940
That's where interoperability standard,
like actual seven or fire comes in.

172
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,430
Third is latency.

173
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:34,960
Predictions aren't useful
if they are out too late.

174
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:40,210
In a clinical setting, especially
in emergency care or ICU, we

175
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,620
need a real time processing.

176
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,360
For instance, if a model detect
a sign of sepsis, but it takes 20

177
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,590
minutes to send that alert to a
nurse, that delay could cost a life.

178
00:11:51,265 --> 00:11:56,005
The architect must therefore support a
low latency interference with a model

179
00:11:56,485 --> 00:12:02,905
running close to the data source,
maybe in the EHR itself or at the edge.

180
00:12:04,135 --> 00:12:05,455
The fourth is data quality.

181
00:12:05,635 --> 00:12:09,235
Even with a perfect infrastructure,
poor data quality can derail everything.

182
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:15,595
A single miscoded allergy, or incorrect
medication dose, or outdated me diagnosis

183
00:12:15,595 --> 00:12:19,525
can lead to an incorrect correction
or worse unsafe recommendation.

184
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,970
These issues aren't theoretical.

185
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:27,520
They happen even every day, and
that's why the next part of this

186
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,230
talk focus specifically on building
a rigorous data quality framework.

187
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,950
One that enables safe,
reliable AI in healthcare

188
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,030
data quality framework.

189
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,285
Let's now turn our focus on data quality.

190
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:46,115
Which is often underestimated, yet
it's arguably the most critical piece

191
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:47,525
of predictive healthcare person.

192
00:12:48,065 --> 00:12:52,085
AI models are only as good
as data they train on.

193
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:53,495
In healthcare.

194
00:12:53,495 --> 00:12:56,045
Bad data does not just
result, improve a prediction.

195
00:12:56,315 --> 00:12:58,535
It can literally put life at risk.

196
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,965
That could be a multiple steps.

197
00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:06,605
Data quality framework to ensure data
used in predictive system is clean,

198
00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:08,645
standardized, and clinically meaningful.

199
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,735
The first step is cleansing.

200
00:13:14,165 --> 00:13:18,275
We correct typos, fix unit errors
or remote duplicate records.

201
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,855
Common in fast phase clinical setting.

202
00:13:20,855 --> 00:13:27,485
For example, temperature has
one oh three.zero Fahrenheit

203
00:13:28,085 --> 00:13:29,795
if missing a decimal could.

204
00:13:29,795 --> 00:13:31,835
Seems like 1,030 Faite

205
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:35,705
second normalization.

206
00:13:36,395 --> 00:13:40,705
Healthcare data comes in varied
units, terminology, and format.

207
00:13:41,215 --> 00:13:46,435
One lab might use glucose in
a milligram per decimal, other

208
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:48,445
use in milligram per liter.

209
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:52,915
One physician might use heart
failure, another might use

210
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,895
CHS, cardiac health failure.

211
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:59,905
Also standardization, need terminology
mapping, unit conversion, and

212
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,275
consistent DATETIME formatting.

213
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,590
Third integration.

214
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:11,590
This involves record lineage
matching a patient lab resolved with

215
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:16,360
their EHR, no medication records
and even variable device data to

216
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,840
build a unified profile that way.

217
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,135
Predictions are based on a complete
context, not fragmented data points.

218
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:26,095
Fourth validation.

219
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:32,665
Even after clean cleaning and integrating
a clinical review, statistic checks or

220
00:14:32,965 --> 00:14:35,335
a logic based verification is needed.

221
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:41,035
For example, if a male patient is
listed as pregnant or a medication

222
00:14:41,035 --> 00:14:45,565
is prescribed outside a safe dose
range, those are caught through an

223
00:14:45,565 --> 00:14:47,455
automatic check or an expert review.

224
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:52,525
Simply put, better data equals
to a better and safe ai.

225
00:14:52,585 --> 00:14:52,615
Okay,

226
00:14:53,615 --> 00:14:56,135
next is AI model Architect.

227
00:14:56,465 --> 00:15:00,725
Now let's sift from a data
preparation to how we design and

228
00:15:00,725 --> 00:15:02,465
build an AI model in healthcare.

229
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:08,435
This is where data science meets a
domain knowledge and where the thoughtful

230
00:15:08,435 --> 00:15:10,775
architect can make or break and initiate.

231
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:16,085
There are three major components in
EA architecture, feature engineering,

232
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:18,705
model selection, and training pipeline.

233
00:15:19,365 --> 00:15:22,005
So let's first take a look
at feature engineering.

234
00:15:22,785 --> 00:15:27,345
Healthcare data is noisy, irregular,
and deeply contextual feature

235
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,265
that extract trend over time.

236
00:15:29,415 --> 00:15:32,715
Suggest changing of blood pressure
or a lab value rather than

237
00:15:32,715 --> 00:15:34,155
relying on a single measurement.

238
00:15:34,695 --> 00:15:39,345
Also normalizing patient demographic
and clinical context, for instance.

239
00:15:40,155 --> 00:15:42,015
Resetting resting ha.

240
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:47,115
Heart rate of 90 means something
very different to a 20-year-old LIC

241
00:15:47,115 --> 00:15:49,905
versus a 70-year-old cardiac patient.

242
00:15:51,405 --> 00:15:53,145
Second model selections.

243
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:58,635
There could be a different choice
of a model that can be used.

244
00:15:58,995 --> 00:16:04,275
Assemble method for complex structured
data like EHR, deep learning models

245
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:06,885
for radiology and image pro imaging.

246
00:16:06,885 --> 00:16:07,995
Pro imaging data.

247
00:16:08,955 --> 00:16:16,245
Based on network, where we need to the
model uncertainty, especially in case

248
00:16:16,245 --> 00:16:21,225
where data is incomplete or ambiguous,
no single algorithm is perfect.

249
00:16:21,255 --> 00:16:26,655
The best result often comes from combining
them, optimizing for an accuracy.

250
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:34,140
Third, training, a pipeline
in healthcare AI model must be

251
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,580
continuously trained and updated.

252
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,520
Auto ML techniques used to tune parameter
efficiently of federated learning.

253
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:47,010
When multiple institutes wants to collect
on model training without sharing raw

254
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:54,000
data, it's important to ensure a version
control properly so that a clinical audit,

255
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,370
trial and regulatory review can be done.

256
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,190
The goal of this entire architect
is deliver accurate, actionable,

257
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,710
continuous ipro, improving prediction.

258
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:08,355
All without compromising
clinical safety and privacy,

259
00:17:09,355 --> 00:17:10,375
explainability innovation.

260
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:14,685
Now let's talk about a critical and
more often overlooked, an aspect

261
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:20,865
of AI explainability, no matter how
accurate the model is, it is, if

262
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:25,935
a clinician does not understand or
trust its output, it won't be used.

263
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:29,745
This can be addressed through four
key explainability techniques.

264
00:17:29,745 --> 00:17:32,925
X feature at first is feature attributes.

265
00:17:34,065 --> 00:17:38,625
Feature attributes shows which data
points influence model decision.

266
00:17:39,045 --> 00:17:43,935
For example, if an EF flag, sepsis
risk, it might highlight rising white

267
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:49,605
blood cell count, or a recent fever as
a top contributor visualization system.

268
00:17:49,605 --> 00:17:51,285
Second is visualization system.

269
00:17:51,715 --> 00:17:57,355
Convert complex probability
model into an interac.

270
00:17:57,925 --> 00:18:02,485
Dashboard using color coded alerts,
trendlines and confidence bar.

271
00:18:03,445 --> 00:18:05,335
The third is contextual explanation.

272
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:11,365
It ties prediction back to the
established medical knowledge offering.

273
00:18:11,635 --> 00:18:18,220
Clinical the why behind an alert,
not just what for this confidence

274
00:18:18,235 --> 00:18:22,555
metrics, communication communi,
which communicate uncertainty.

275
00:18:24,085 --> 00:18:29,725
A prediction with 95% confidence carries
more weight than the one with 60%.

276
00:18:30,055 --> 00:18:34,825
It helps clinicals gauge how
much trust to place in the ai.

277
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:38,815
Ensure transparency builds trust,
and trust drives the eruption.

278
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,060
A

279
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,270
let's bring all together
with a real world example.

280
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,660
Let's look at a case study
from the marketplace.

281
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,930
Cardiac care transformation
at a regional hospital.

282
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:58,790
Original hospital integrates AI model
directly into an EHR system, focusing

283
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:05,120
on health risk, cardiac patient,
and the staff training, helping

284
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,180
clinician understand how the how to
interpret a I one alert and incorporate

285
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,830
them into their daily workflow.

286
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:12,920
Okay.

287
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:19,400
Within months, the research
shows miserable re results about

288
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,280
one third reduction in cardiac
related hospital remission.

289
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:30,180
Patients were flagged, almost flagged
with a risk almost a week or more

290
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,090
earlier for the potential complication.

291
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:39,450
Hospital reported over millions in
annual saving in a patient care.

292
00:19:40,635 --> 00:19:46,965
This is the power of AI and this
properly integrated, not just

293
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:48,525
predictive, but transformative.

294
00:19:49,525 --> 00:19:53,785
Let's look at the economic
impact beyond clinical outcome.

295
00:19:53,785 --> 00:19:56,695
Predictive healthcare delivers
significant economic value.

296
00:19:57,325 --> 00:19:59,575
Hospitalization is expensive.

297
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:03,925
Emergency care is expensive,
but early intervention that's

298
00:20:03,925 --> 00:20:05,095
efficient and scalable.

299
00:20:06,385 --> 00:20:11,845
Hence healthcare system implementing
ai, data engineering solution

300
00:20:12,265 --> 00:20:15,115
achieves substantial cost reduction.

301
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:21,774
That's because the risk can be
captured away in a advance, and a

302
00:20:21,774 --> 00:20:23,874
medication can be applied to a patient.

303
00:20:24,864 --> 00:20:28,584
This isn't just about a
better medicine, it's about

304
00:20:28,584 --> 00:20:30,475
sustainable healthcare economic.

305
00:20:31,475 --> 00:20:33,814
Let's look at the implementation roadmap.

306
00:20:34,654 --> 00:20:38,495
So how we actually implement a
predictive healthcare in a real world.

307
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:42,919
Let's look at the steps
that needs to be followed.

308
00:20:44,219 --> 00:20:46,235
First assessment phase.

309
00:20:46,714 --> 00:20:50,614
Evaluate your current data maturity
and a clinical pain points.

310
00:20:51,424 --> 00:20:54,754
Second, understand the
infrastructure development.

311
00:20:55,144 --> 00:20:58,114
Needed to build an AI application.

312
00:20:58,745 --> 00:21:03,124
Build pipelines to inject
clean or harmonize data.

313
00:21:04,534 --> 00:21:06,604
Third, AI model implementation.

314
00:21:07,715 --> 00:21:13,759
Understand how to train AI model test,
validate model for a key use case.

315
00:21:14,979 --> 00:21:19,384
Fourth, clinical integration,
Amber predictions into a clinical

316
00:21:19,384 --> 00:21:21,274
workflow and train staff.

317
00:21:22,685 --> 00:21:24,485
Fifth, continuous improvement.

318
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,119
Monitor, model performance,
and retain as necessary.

319
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:33,089
Now, let's look at the future
of predictive healthcare.

320
00:21:33,569 --> 00:21:38,579
Finally, where is predictive
healthcare going first?

321
00:21:38,909 --> 00:21:40,649
Personalized, predictive model.

322
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:47,909
By integrating gen data, we will move
from a population level inside to

323
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:50,129
an individualized risk assessment.

324
00:21:51,764 --> 00:21:57,194
UBI case monitoring, continuous
input from a smartwatch, blood

325
00:21:57,194 --> 00:21:59,984
pressure heart rate monitoring.

326
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:09,915
Even a smart toilet will feed predictive
information to a AM model 24 7.

327
00:22:10,964 --> 00:22:12,794
The third is system wise integration.

328
00:22:13,184 --> 00:22:17,774
AI will operate not in silos, but
across entire hospital networks.

329
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:20,715
Optimizing care delivery at scale.

330
00:22:21,884 --> 00:22:28,154
AI acumen, Acumenta clinicians,
much like pilots rely on autopilot.

331
00:22:28,424 --> 00:22:32,114
Clinician will use AI as
testosterone partner in the care.

332
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:38,254
In short, predictive healthcare is
not just evolving, it's accelerating.

333
00:22:39,695 --> 00:22:40,114
Thank you.
