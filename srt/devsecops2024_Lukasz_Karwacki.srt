1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,909
My name is Łukasz.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,090
I'm a security solution
architect at G Core.

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,560
Firstly, thank you for organizing
this conference, CON42.

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,799
I'm excited to talk to you
about our comprehensive approach

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,190
here at G Core to protect
infrastructure from Adidas attacks.

6
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,330
Also, why connecting web application
protection with protecting infrastructure

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,059
is crucial in current times.

8
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:22,350
During my talk, feel free
to ping me over Slack.

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,090
If you have any questions or comments,
I will do my best to answer all of them.

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,580
Firstly, I want to, in my speech, talk
about the G Core infrastructure, what the

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,000
cyber security means in current times.

12
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:39,419
also about the DDoS attack, what
the DDoS attack means, protecting

13
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:41,099
your infrastructure with the G Core.

14
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:43,859
firstly, let's go to the
G Core infrastructure.

15
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:47,379
G Core, so we are a global
company, It means that we are

16
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:48,979
located across the whole world.

17
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:51,629
You can find our point of
presence across the whole world.

18
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:55,029
We have more than 180 points of
presence across the whole world.

19
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:58,129
Also, we have more than
50 cloud locations.

20
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:00,519
We are located in Luxembourg.

21
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:02,039
There we have the headquarter.

22
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,089
But also, like I said, we
have the global presence.

23
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:12,099
At the core of our industry, this
is the low latency secure network.

24
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:16,069
It means that we are focusing
to provide a low latency network

25
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:17,429
for all of our customers.

26
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:22,969
Also, what we can say that due to that
our network capabilities, we are more than

27
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:26,779
sure we are able to handle everything,
all the traffic that is coming to us.

28
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:30,949
Also, the biggest DDoS attacks, but about
that, I will tell you a bit later on.

29
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,429
what the cyber security means.

30
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:36,079
so cyber security, okay.

31
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,239
Cyber security is very, very large topic.

32
00:01:38,604 --> 00:01:41,384
So what that means that protecting
and monitoring, we need to

33
00:01:41,384 --> 00:01:42,904
protect and monitor everything.

34
00:01:43,384 --> 00:01:43,644
Yeah.

35
00:01:43,834 --> 00:01:44,734
Why not everything?

36
00:01:45,164 --> 00:01:45,594
It's impossible.

37
00:01:46,004 --> 00:01:47,194
But let's split it.

38
00:01:47,564 --> 00:01:51,134
So we need to protect the
Network, of course network.

39
00:01:51,134 --> 00:01:55,054
This is the core thing for most
of us, most of our businesses.

40
00:01:55,654 --> 00:01:55,874
Endpoints.

41
00:01:56,374 --> 00:01:59,904
physical endpoint, physical end
devices in each of the company.

42
00:02:00,274 --> 00:02:05,584
This is crucial that we need to protect
them and monitor what users are, what

43
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,224
users of our, in our company are doing.

44
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:11,214
What, our, workers are
doing on the devices.

45
00:02:11,254 --> 00:02:15,104
This is crucial from the security
point of view, from the cybersecurity.

46
00:02:15,634 --> 00:02:17,004
Later on, applications.

47
00:02:17,474 --> 00:02:18,844
Also web applications.

48
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:19,394
Yeah.

49
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:22,084
And also the applications
that we have on our endpoints.

50
00:02:22,084 --> 00:02:22,099
Yeah.

51
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:23,669
Web applications.

52
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:24,239
Yeah.

53
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:26,969
We need to monitor them and
we need to protect them.

54
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:30,079
Web applications, crucial for
our business, for most of us.

55
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:31,889
later on access.

56
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:33,799
I am so connect.

57
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:38,819
So privileges and the,
what the users can perform.

58
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:42,389
This is crucial to protect
and monitor what the users

59
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:43,759
can do and what they can do.

60
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:46,889
Provide the lowest privileges
that they should have.

61
00:02:47,339 --> 00:02:52,069
To just be sure that we are not providing
something access to something someone

62
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:58,644
shouldn't have access for so All of
this, we are going to the cyber threats.

63
00:02:58,654 --> 00:03:00,264
Cyber threats are escalating.

64
00:03:00,354 --> 00:03:01,894
Yeah, everyone will agree.

65
00:03:02,274 --> 00:03:05,074
I don't think so that we'll have
here someone who will say that

66
00:03:05,204 --> 00:03:07,564
cyber threats are not escalating
and they are decreasing.

67
00:03:07,684 --> 00:03:10,624
No, cyber threats are increasing a lot.

68
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:15,999
We received, a lot of reports
that this, this rise in the cyber

69
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:18,189
threats is parabolic currently.

70
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:23,859
Maybe later on in the coming years, it
will, just be increased step by step.

71
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:27,629
Maybe due to AI, due to maybe
machine learning, we'll be able to

72
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:32,639
like, reduce the, the rise of the
cyber threats at least by something.

73
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,669
But currently, I don't think so.

74
00:03:35,224 --> 00:03:36,804
cyber threats are rising.

75
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:40,174
It means that the crimes, the
number of the crimes, cyber

76
00:03:40,174 --> 00:03:41,754
crimes, will be more and more.

77
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:46,444
For us, it means that we have
more and more DDoS attacks.

78
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:51,754
So we have more applications to protect,
more infrastructure to protect, more

79
00:03:51,754 --> 00:03:53,204
servers that we need to protect.

80
00:03:53,574 --> 00:03:58,024
So more things that we need to protect,
number of the attacks are increasing,

81
00:03:58,134 --> 00:04:02,144
so we have like more servers, more
attacks, more different types of attack.

82
00:04:02,804 --> 00:04:05,454
So we have disaster from
security point of view.

83
00:04:05,824 --> 00:04:10,054
Yeah, and here we have G Core
to protect you from everything.

84
00:04:10,894 --> 00:04:12,374
Okay, from near everything.

85
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:13,504
Okay.

86
00:04:14,249 --> 00:04:18,519
like I said, number of the trees
is increasing and the scale of

87
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:21,719
this increasing also the scale
or the DDoS attack is increasing.

88
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:26,429
So this is the, this is with
what the people need to face.

89
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:30,949
in case that's okay, our
security, protocols, everything

90
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,189
that we have from security point
of view is fine here and now.

91
00:04:34,549 --> 00:04:38,799
Here and now our network capabilities for,
dealing with the DDoS attack are fine.

92
00:04:39,124 --> 00:04:40,414
But what about in five years?

93
00:04:40,554 --> 00:04:41,724
What about in 10 years?

94
00:04:42,224 --> 00:04:46,544
Are we sure that without doing
anything that will increase our

95
00:04:46,544 --> 00:04:49,804
capabilities to deal with the cyber
threats, we'll stay on this business.

96
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:50,924
We'll stay on the network.

97
00:04:50,934 --> 00:04:51,884
We'll be visible.

98
00:04:52,004 --> 00:04:54,394
We'll be able to provide the
services to our customer.

99
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:55,344
I don't think so.

100
00:04:55,534 --> 00:04:59,154
To be honest, you need to,
increase your security level.

101
00:04:59,654 --> 00:05:01,744
Constantly, you need
to increase, increase.

102
00:05:01,744 --> 00:05:03,214
You need to build better services.

103
00:05:03,214 --> 00:05:04,914
You need to build more services.

104
00:05:04,914 --> 00:05:09,074
You need to build everything, better,
more and bigger infrastructure.

105
00:05:10,024 --> 00:05:13,234
going further, what about the DDoS attack?

106
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:14,294
DDoS attacks?

107
00:05:14,794 --> 00:05:15,588
We can have one attack.

108
00:05:15,588 --> 00:05:17,044
Maybe we have more attacks.

109
00:05:17,144 --> 00:05:17,444
Yeah.

110
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,674
So we have, mostly three different
types of the DDoS attack.

111
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:24,624
The first, the three, the most common
one, to be honest, Volumetric attack.

112
00:05:24,964 --> 00:05:29,034
It means that, we have an attacker
that is sending tons of the request,

113
00:05:29,044 --> 00:05:33,414
like we can imagine millions, the whole
ocean of the request of the traffic

114
00:05:33,424 --> 00:05:35,264
that is coming to our, backend server.

115
00:05:35,854 --> 00:05:38,454
And our server won't be
able to deal with it.

116
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:44,204
I'm more than sure that in case of DDoS
attack without any protection, 99 slash 9.

117
00:05:44,384 --> 00:05:46,814
9999 percent of the
servers will be taken down.

118
00:05:46,994 --> 00:05:48,994
Of course, in case that there
will be small DDoS attack.

119
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:52,754
In such case, maybe server will
survive and we'll have super,

120
00:05:53,184 --> 00:05:54,804
server from, from future.

121
00:05:55,304 --> 00:05:56,654
So volumetric attacks.

122
00:05:56,664 --> 00:05:59,804
So here we have the tons of the
requests, a lot of requests.

123
00:05:59,804 --> 00:06:02,944
Mostly it means that
there is like this attack.

124
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:07,184
We'll try to use all the bandwidth, all
the resources that we have on the server,

125
00:06:07,244 --> 00:06:08,934
on the bandwidth that we have available.

126
00:06:09,254 --> 00:06:13,094
Mostly here, attackers are
using EDP flat, ECMP flats.

127
00:06:13,254 --> 00:06:13,644
So.

128
00:06:14,384 --> 00:06:15,284
IPsec flat.

129
00:06:15,304 --> 00:06:18,914
So a lot of, packets that they
are just spamming with it.

130
00:06:19,174 --> 00:06:21,574
Spamming, there is totally
spam on this request.

131
00:06:21,654 --> 00:06:24,644
And there is like near zero
of the good requests here.

132
00:06:24,914 --> 00:06:27,114
So this is a typical volumetric attack.

133
00:06:27,494 --> 00:06:29,504
Later on, we have, connection attacks.

134
00:06:29,874 --> 00:06:33,704
So here we have the attacks that
they are just, creating attacker

135
00:06:33,754 --> 00:06:37,094
is creating here the connection
and never ending this connection.

136
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:41,134
It means that we have the one user
that is logging into the shop.

137
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:46,139
For example, the webshop, adding
something to the cart and doing nothing.

138
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:49,629
And we have 10, 000 such, clients.

139
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:50,159
Okay.

140
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:54,659
That will just over That will
just use all of our resources

141
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:55,849
that the server does we have.

142
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,689
Later on, what in case that
we have the game server?

143
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:03,599
And we have the, attacker
that is establishing 20.

144
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:10,174
Thousand or twenty millions connections
to the server from the one user.

145
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:11,444
That's possible.

146
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:15,224
And in such case, without a
DDoS protection, this user, this

147
00:07:15,224 --> 00:07:19,714
attacker, being Tritos a normal
user, will just use all the resources

148
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:21,404
that we'll have on our server.

149
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:25,864
So here attackers mostly use the,
like previously UDP TCP protocol,

150
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:29,274
but mostly this part that is
responsible for keeping the connection.

151
00:07:29,304 --> 00:07:31,034
So the connection is still kept open.

152
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:34,964
So the connection is keep open
forever until we from the server

153
00:07:34,964 --> 00:07:36,354
side, we will close this connection.

154
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:38,514
So it means that if the
connection is never closed.

155
00:07:39,014 --> 00:07:43,414
So we have problem because our server
soon will be out of the resources.

156
00:07:43,734 --> 00:07:46,924
And if we don't have the
resources for attacker, great.

157
00:07:47,224 --> 00:07:51,984
But in the same time, we have normal
user who want to perform some actions.

158
00:07:52,034 --> 00:07:54,614
In such case, he won't be able to do that.

159
00:07:55,024 --> 00:08:00,374
Due to that, Without, that the user won't
be able to perform normal actions due to

160
00:08:00,444 --> 00:08:04,494
the older resources are reserved for the
non existing user, for the connections

161
00:08:04,494 --> 00:08:06,164
that there are opened by the attacker.

162
00:08:06,474 --> 00:08:09,344
It means we are just, we have the problem.

163
00:08:09,874 --> 00:08:14,634
We have the problem because normal user is
not able to perform any actions later on.

164
00:08:15,334 --> 00:08:19,244
So these two, types of the attack, they
are mostly on the layer three, layer four.

165
00:08:19,404 --> 00:08:21,734
So on the layer seven, we
have the application attacks.

166
00:08:22,354 --> 00:08:25,864
Application attacks, they are mostly
focusing on the complexity of the attack.

167
00:08:25,954 --> 00:08:29,034
They are trying to use some kind of
the vulnerabilities on the server,

168
00:08:29,044 --> 00:08:31,134
vulnerabilities on the web application.

169
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:34,294
So it means that we'll try
to use some kind of the small

170
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:36,714
part of the volume that we can.

171
00:08:37,264 --> 00:08:41,964
to just use the server in a way
that he will, for example, do some

172
00:08:41,964 --> 00:08:47,334
recurrences, do some loop inside the,
some, some processes on the server.

173
00:08:47,334 --> 00:08:52,194
And in this way, we'll just use all the
resources on the machine, on the server,

174
00:08:52,294 --> 00:08:56,804
and that server will won't be able to
response for the normal user activities.

175
00:08:57,754 --> 00:08:58,984
So that's the issue.

176
00:08:59,014 --> 00:09:00,504
That's the problem that
we are facing here.

177
00:09:00,604 --> 00:09:01,624
The application attacks.

178
00:09:02,234 --> 00:09:02,564
Okay.

179
00:09:03,064 --> 00:09:03,644
What's further?

180
00:09:04,504 --> 00:09:08,434
So we have the attacks, we have the
attacks, and we have challenges.

181
00:09:09,274 --> 00:09:11,324
Yeah, because we have attacks
and we have challenges.

182
00:09:11,324 --> 00:09:14,254
What the good DDoS protection
will be able to handle?

183
00:09:14,274 --> 00:09:16,224
What good DDoS protection
will be able to do?

184
00:09:16,554 --> 00:09:19,014
Firstly, real time protection.

185
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:22,304
Real time protection is
crucial in current times.

186
00:09:22,374 --> 00:09:23,694
Can you imagine that?

187
00:09:24,054 --> 00:09:25,324
Okay, we have two scenarios.

188
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:28,114
We have a DDoS protection that
is providing the protection

189
00:09:28,444 --> 00:09:30,784
since beginning, always on.

190
00:09:31,194 --> 00:09:36,944
Full traffic is filtered and second
protection that is filtering 100

191
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:40,514
percent of the DDoS attack, but after
one minute, you have 100 percent

192
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:42,174
fully mitigating all the DDoS attack.

193
00:09:42,994 --> 00:09:43,524
You know what?

194
00:09:43,724 --> 00:09:47,704
the first DDoS protection will be
better if we protect from the, even

195
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:48,794
for example, it will be cheaper.

196
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:53,579
80 percent 90 percent and he will do
the same because he will first clean all

197
00:09:53,619 --> 00:09:57,419
the traffic and the second protection
will be much cheaper But it will clean

198
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:02,369
the traffic from the first after first
minute in the one minutes Attacker will

199
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:08,259
be able to for example sent to you one
terabit per second over 60 seconds.

200
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:13,839
I Don't think so that we have the server
in the world that will be able to handle

201
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:18,674
one terabit per second over Constantly
one minute I don't think so that we

202
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:22,044
have server like that on the world.

203
00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:24,204
The issue that we are facing
with the DDoS protection, this

204
00:10:24,204 --> 00:10:25,254
is the real time protection.

205
00:10:25,264 --> 00:10:29,054
It means that all the traffic
that is delivered to the server,

206
00:10:29,264 --> 00:10:30,544
it must be already clean.

207
00:10:31,144 --> 00:10:34,324
And this is the approach that, for
example, we at GCON, we are doing.

208
00:10:34,544 --> 00:10:38,354
So we are, be sure that the
traffic that is sent to our

209
00:10:38,464 --> 00:10:40,104
customers is already cleaned.

210
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:45,284
If you are not cleaning, firstly, the
whole incoming traffic, that's the issue.

211
00:10:45,969 --> 00:10:49,619
That's the big issue, because you
are allowing the attacker to send

212
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:53,639
the malicious request, malicious
payload, malicious amount of the huge

213
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:55,029
amount of the traffic to the server.

214
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:57,149
Even after one minute,
you will clean everything.

215
00:10:57,249 --> 00:11:00,699
The server will be already down
after this one minute, or maybe

216
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:04,099
not responsible for, I don't know,
a few hours without resetting.

217
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:05,439
So that's the issue.

218
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:07,639
That's why the real protection is needed.

219
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:11,449
Also, okay, we have two
different scenarios, the web

220
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:12,889
application and the game server.

221
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:17,314
For the web application Okay, after
one minute, maybe we restart the

222
00:11:17,314 --> 00:11:20,384
server, everything that will be fine
because we have this protection.

223
00:11:20,804 --> 00:11:24,724
Okay, maybe someone want to make this
approach, but what about the game server?

224
00:11:25,544 --> 00:11:28,494
Okay, about the game server, if we have
the game server, we need protection

225
00:11:28,664 --> 00:11:31,244
here, now, in real time, always.

226
00:11:31,744 --> 00:11:36,074
I can't imagine that someone who is
hosting, for example, the game and have

227
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:41,734
thousands of the servers will allow to
restart all of the servers After one

228
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:46,134
minute, because the DDoS attack happened,
I think he will have tons of the angry

229
00:11:46,134 --> 00:11:48,854
players that will stop playing his game.

230
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:51,544
They will leave the game, they
will leave the server, they will

231
00:11:51,554 --> 00:11:54,374
stop buying something in the
shop, for example, from this game.

232
00:11:54,674 --> 00:11:55,874
So that's the huge problem.

233
00:11:56,704 --> 00:11:58,654
Going further, network code design.

234
00:11:59,194 --> 00:12:00,884
This is a challenge for
Intuitus Protection.

235
00:12:00,914 --> 00:12:04,394
Because, for example, if we take the
game servers, the netcode of the games.

236
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:06,994
Games, different games
using different netcode.

237
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,774
It means that different netcode.

238
00:12:10,734 --> 00:12:12,294
it's used by different games.

239
00:12:12,304 --> 00:12:12,954
So we have.

240
00:12:13,584 --> 00:12:17,574
We can have thousands of the different
type of the, we can have thousands of

241
00:12:17,574 --> 00:12:21,674
the different and network code design
are more than sure in at least even

242
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,524
1 percent of this code is vulnerable.

243
00:12:23,614 --> 00:12:26,774
We have problem for this game
that there is in this protocol

244
00:12:27,034 --> 00:12:30,204
because, attackers will more than
sure use this vulnerabilities.

245
00:12:30,604 --> 00:12:35,304
So here we need a DDoS attack that will
be preventing from exploiting such things.

246
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:38,339
In case that, okay, there will be
vulnerable, vulnerability that will

247
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:39,729
allow attackers to use something.

248
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:43,759
But in front of it, we have the DDoS
protection that is blocking all of the

249
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,779
malicious requests based on some rules.

250
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:50,839
Yeah, with this approach, we can
leave the DDoS protection part.

251
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,849
from the network code design.

252
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,649
Of course, code should be good, but we
can left this network code design part

253
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:01,469
to the DDoS protection solution to be
sure that the DDoS protection solution

254
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,689
will prevent everything from that.

255
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:06,989
It will prevent the attackers
from using these vulnerabilities.

256
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:09,629
Later on, we have the evolving threats.

257
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:11,959
Like I said at the beginning,
threats are evolving.

258
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:12,909
Okay.

259
00:13:13,189 --> 00:13:17,529
I will tell a bit later on, but also
Evolving threats, what we are facing

260
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:22,619
currently, what scenarios we are, this
is scenarios from the real cases, like

261
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:27,979
attackers are doing a lot of work,
they are spending a lot of money to

262
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:32,579
just realize that the user, that the
customer is, for example, hosting

263
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:37,009
the web server, the web application
on the same machine, on the same

264
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:40,099
network, that also the infrastructure,
for example, the game servers.

265
00:13:40,574 --> 00:13:44,474
We have the case that the someone is using
the, someone's hosting the game server,

266
00:13:44,784 --> 00:13:47,184
for example, I don't know, Minecraft.

267
00:13:47,184 --> 00:13:50,344
We have the Minecraft server,
and we have also the, some shop

268
00:13:50,384 --> 00:13:51,564
inside the Minecraft server.

269
00:13:51,804 --> 00:13:54,314
And maybe this shop is on
the same machine, on the same

270
00:13:54,314 --> 00:13:55,764
network that is the game server.

271
00:13:56,224 --> 00:14:00,354
So maybe we can use the web
application that is not using the

272
00:14:00,354 --> 00:14:03,924
web application firewall to take down
the infrastructure, to take down the

273
00:14:03,924 --> 00:14:06,354
server, the game server, and vice versa.

274
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:09,909
Maybe we'll be able to take down the
web application taking down the whole

275
00:14:09,909 --> 00:14:14,979
infrastructure by taking down the game
server if we don't use here, if we don't

276
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,089
use here the full comprehensive approach.

277
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:22,709
Also, using bot, botnets, this
is also a huge problem for future

278
00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:23,879
and also for current times.

279
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:28,579
Going further, high performance
infrastructure, crucial point because I

280
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:33,069
can't imagine that someone will be able
to handle a huge DDoS attacks without

281
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:37,759
the good infrastructure, good performance
on this infrastructure, and good quality

282
00:14:37,819 --> 00:14:39,279
of the service that he is providing.

283
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:43,679
Without the good infrastructure, you are
not able to provide the good service.

284
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:48,609
So we need high performance, super
fast servers, and super good fast DDoS

285
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,599
protection with the lowest latency.

286
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:51,729
Because of great.

287
00:14:52,134 --> 00:14:54,964
All kinds of the, all kinds of the
protections, adding some latency.

288
00:14:55,534 --> 00:15:00,084
Here at G Core, we are providing the
lowest latency that is possible for

289
00:15:00,084 --> 00:15:04,304
our customers, because we are the
closest, and the closest source, we

290
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:08,306
are the closest on the source attack
that's possible to reduce the latency,

291
00:15:08,306 --> 00:15:11,139
to reduce the risk for our customers.

292
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:12,649
Going further.

293
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,999
we have Nudinus protection and
we have the web application.

294
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:18,059
Okay, so we have the web application.

295
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:22,349
When we have the web application, we
need also, we need to protect it from the

296
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:26,079
latest attacks, layer three, layer four,
mostly, for example, the infrastructure

297
00:15:26,109 --> 00:15:27,359
and also the web application.

298
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,209
For protecting the web application,
the typical web application firewall.

299
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:33,169
Yeah, because we need it.

300
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:38,089
This is I can't imagine going live
with even a library with a non profit

301
00:15:38,099 --> 00:15:43,379
sample, non profit service, non profit
application without the simplest, at

302
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:45,089
least the simple web application firewall.

303
00:15:45,229 --> 00:15:47,219
This is totally no go from
security point of view.

304
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:49,149
Later on, bot management.

305
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:50,969
We have good bots and bad bots.

306
00:15:51,109 --> 00:15:55,239
Good bots, they are bots that they are,
for example, they are the web search bots.

307
00:15:55,514 --> 00:15:57,464
Indexing bots and other bots like that.

308
00:15:57,504 --> 00:15:58,084
They are good one.

309
00:15:58,174 --> 00:16:01,874
We want to allow them to flourish
our application but in the same

310
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:06,559
time we don't want to allow bad bots
like Scrapping bots, some bots that

311
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:10,099
they are doing some autonomous test,
penetration test on our website.

312
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:12,189
We don't want such bots
and we need to block them.

313
00:16:12,229 --> 00:16:14,789
We need to block them on
the application layer.

314
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:16,959
Later on, we have a DDoS protection.

315
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:20,229
We have the layer 3, layer
4 DDoS protection, but also

316
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:21,649
unvolumetric attacks there.

317
00:16:21,729 --> 00:16:24,599
And also we have the volumetric
attacks on the layer 7.

318
00:16:24,729 --> 00:16:25,469
Yeah, it happens.

319
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:26,019
Why not?

320
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,374
We have, you can have tons of the
middle, have tons of their, DDoS attack

321
00:16:30,384 --> 00:16:34,344
that they're on the layer seven and
they are, for example, the HTTP floats.

322
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:35,264
Yeah, why not?

323
00:16:35,314 --> 00:16:36,834
Attackers can do that, can send that.

324
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:41,264
So we need also the DDoS protection, also
the volumetric one on the layer seven.

325
00:16:41,484 --> 00:16:44,354
For that, you need the huge
infrastructure, you need

326
00:16:44,354 --> 00:16:45,734
huge network capabilities.

327
00:16:46,364 --> 00:16:47,434
API security.

328
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:49,854
This is like also very important thing.

329
00:16:50,124 --> 00:16:53,914
I can't imagine that you, just, running
application, running some services.

330
00:16:54,369 --> 00:16:57,439
We want API protection in the
current times with the current

331
00:16:57,439 --> 00:17:01,579
solutions with the current threats
that they're arising This is crucial

332
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:03,539
points and everything like that.

333
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,579
You have for example in our solution in
our web solution Going further we have

334
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:13,289
a we discussed the two layers of the
DDoS protection to be honest This is

335
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:17,594
the free layer from the technical point
of view Layer 3, Layer 4, and Layer 7.

336
00:17:18,014 --> 00:17:19,864
But let's split it here as two layers.

337
00:17:19,894 --> 00:17:23,064
Layer 3 and 4, protecting the
infrastructure, and Layer 7,

338
00:17:23,094 --> 00:17:24,534
protecting the web application.

339
00:17:25,034 --> 00:17:29,364
For the protecting the infrastructure,
so our main objective is to

340
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:33,264
protect the infrastructure, the
servers, the network, the heart,

341
00:17:33,494 --> 00:17:36,024
the inside, the core of everything.

342
00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:39,779
Here on the web application side, we
are like protecting the infrastructure.

343
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,339
the web application, it can be, we
can say that this is the front end,

344
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:48,449
front to the front end for the, for our
customers, for our clients that they

345
00:17:48,449 --> 00:17:52,249
will use, for example, some e commerce
shops, some shops, they will try to,

346
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:55,769
for example, make some, actions on the
bank accounts, other things like that

347
00:17:56,099 --> 00:17:59,989
on the layer three, layer four, we are
focusing against, to protect against

348
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:04,419
the, attacks that will exhaust network
bandwidth, and they will just overhaul

349
00:18:04,489 --> 00:18:06,409
our resources that we have on our servers.

350
00:18:06,979 --> 00:18:09,979
On the web application
side, we have same risks.

351
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:14,639
And also, additionally, we need to figure
out that if the attacks want to use

352
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:16,789
vulnerabilities on our web application.

353
00:18:17,249 --> 00:18:21,509
I can't imagine that we're running
web application without the WAF,

354
00:18:21,849 --> 00:18:24,929
and we have vulnerability that will
allow, for example, have negative

355
00:18:24,939 --> 00:18:26,239
balance on the bank account.

356
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:27,264
You know what?

357
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:27,884
I don't think so.

358
00:18:27,884 --> 00:18:31,014
That's, that will be good from
the reputation point of view.

359
00:18:31,514 --> 00:18:35,594
Speaking about the reputation, we'll
tell, we'll speak about it later on.

360
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:36,464
Going further.

361
00:18:36,894 --> 00:18:38,654
So we have the DDoS attack.

362
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:41,574
And what in case that we have a
typical small customer that is

363
00:18:41,584 --> 00:18:43,564
using, for example, a few servers.

364
00:18:44,464 --> 00:18:50,394
Oh, maybe some tools like some
small WAF, maybe some, let's say,

365
00:18:50,394 --> 00:18:52,354
manual DDoS protection rules.

366
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:57,239
In case of the DDoS attack, his chances
to survive are near zero, because

367
00:18:57,249 --> 00:19:02,959
this is like he's trying to build the
protection without having enough tools.

368
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:07,609
For example, I can imagine that it would
be similar situation like we are trying

369
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:10,929
to build a wall without the tools,
wall for example from the bricks, but

370
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:14,639
we can't make bricks, because we don't
have enough tools, or we can't cut the

371
00:19:14,639 --> 00:19:17,929
tree to build some polysate, because
we don't have also the tools to that.

372
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:22,589
In such case, here, the user, the
person that is trying to protect

373
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:26,549
himself and his infrastructure from
this attack, without the tools, his

374
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:28,049
chances to survive are near zero.

375
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:33,239
But when he will start using some tools,
he recognize that, okay, I have more

376
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:37,079
tools, I have more options, I have more
capabilities to deal with the attacker.

377
00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:41,449
Maybe I will be able to survive and
my business will be on the Good road.

378
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:41,869
Yeah.

379
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:44,959
But you to that, to do that,
you need the D protection.

380
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:46,189
You need some tools.

381
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:51,439
Tools can bring, you are bring by the
D protection or the web application

382
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:54,349
protection, by the, by the solutions.

383
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:58,749
like our, when we are able to provide
the tools for our customers to

384
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:02,739
survive the DS attack, to survive the
attacks from the attackers survive

385
00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:04,779
on the current of the current risks.

386
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:06,629
But when we have a DS attack.

387
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:08,639
Okay, we have a news attack.

388
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:12,689
Let's say we blocked 50 percent of
the traffic with our manual tools.

389
00:20:13,229 --> 00:20:16,339
We didn't use any advanced provider.

390
00:20:16,979 --> 00:20:21,019
And okay, we survived somehow,
but we had a few hours of

391
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,709
interruption of our services.

392
00:20:22,729 --> 00:20:25,459
Our database is somewhere in the dark web.

393
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,379
Okay, and what's now?

394
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:29,464
Okay, we have problem.

395
00:20:29,594 --> 00:20:30,024
Yeah.

396
00:20:30,324 --> 00:20:31,914
In such cases, we have problem.

397
00:20:32,294 --> 00:20:38,204
So going this direction, such user,
such typical small company will have

398
00:20:38,244 --> 00:20:40,034
issues from the financial point of view.

399
00:20:40,134 --> 00:20:40,514
Yeah.

400
00:20:40,984 --> 00:20:46,124
Because first of all, for example,
that was the webshop and they were

401
00:20:46,124 --> 00:20:50,814
not able to, users are not able to,
make some transactions on the website.

402
00:20:51,094 --> 00:20:51,524
Yeah.

403
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:51,954
Okay.

404
00:20:51,974 --> 00:20:58,039
We are, we lost revenue, but what in case
that We had also some legal consequences

405
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:01,209
from that point of view, because we had
some agreement with other companies that

406
00:21:01,229 --> 00:21:06,699
in case that, we won't be able to sell
some kind of the shoes or something.

407
00:21:06,819 --> 00:21:08,149
Let's say shoes, let's take the shoes.

408
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:14,619
in the same time, we need to pay the fee
because we, our shop was unable to sell.

409
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:18,089
We are unable to sell the shoes for 10
percent of the time during, for example,

410
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:19,649
one week or one month or one day.

411
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:23,279
And due to that, we need to pay the fee
because we agree on such agreements.

412
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:23,319
Thanks.

413
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:28,929
So we have second time we have
the financial use first one users

414
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:33,179
Customers didn't buy something
in a web shop second one.

415
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:37,549
We need to pay the fee So combining
these two things we have we are

416
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:41,069
losing reputation This is we are
losing the trust in our business.

417
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:41,979
this is very good.

418
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:46,249
This is very important point
of view going further comparing

419
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:49,329
everything, we have disruption on
the operations that we are performing

420
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:50,849
and our users are able to perform.

421
00:21:50,989 --> 00:21:55,399
Can you imagine that you are hosting
bank, international bank, and

422
00:21:55,409 --> 00:21:59,279
your users are unable to perform
international bank transfer, or

423
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:03,899
maybe you are not able to send a bank
transfer between different banks.

424
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:07,399
, that's issue because for example,
what in case that you want, you

425
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:08,749
are not able to pay the law.

426
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:13,509
If you are a bank and you need to pay
the law or something like that, we are

427
00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:18,399
backing to the legal sequence and this
is why, because there was a attack

428
00:22:18,399 --> 00:22:22,749
and you didn't realize that maybe you
need some protection going further.

429
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:25,079
Customer impact, this is the issue that's.

430
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:29,489
Many, I'm still facing this
and, that people don't recognize

431
00:22:29,499 --> 00:22:32,049
that the customer is a king.

432
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:33,329
Customer is the king.

433
00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:33,859
This is the truth.

434
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:35,469
And we need to agree on that.

435
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:38,469
Customer impact from the attack is huge.

436
00:22:38,969 --> 00:22:43,599
What in case that we have the group of
friends, like 10 people, 10 friends, that

437
00:22:43,749 --> 00:22:47,559
they want to play some game, they buy the
server from some hosting provider, let's

438
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:50,579
say they want to play Minecraft, they want
to build some houses on the Minecraft.

439
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:51,449
Okay, great.

440
00:22:51,949 --> 00:22:55,559
What in such case they buy the
server, they pay for the server on

441
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,239
the hosting that is under DDoS attack.

442
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:00,119
And the server is constantly down.

443
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:05,999
Okay, maybe they will survive somehow and
maybe they will play on this server when

444
00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:08,509
there is outside of the DDoS attack hours.

445
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:13,979
But I'm more than sure later on they will
never ever back to this hosting company.

446
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:18,889
And also they will tell their friends
that don't go to this hosting company.

447
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:23,599
They are constantly under DDoS attack
because we didn't were able to play on the

448
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:25,099
Minecraft server that we paid the money.

449
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:29,659
So can you see that this
is like the spider web?

450
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:33,759
This is increasing, like the customers
are spreading the news, spreading

451
00:23:34,229 --> 00:23:38,569
the truth that this hosting company
was not using the DDoS protection

452
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:40,579
at all, or maybe some pure one.

453
00:23:40,949 --> 00:23:45,569
And we will pay for the server, but
we are unable to use the services.

454
00:23:46,349 --> 00:23:49,189
And going further, we have
the competitive disadvantage.

455
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:53,429
With all these points, we have the
issue that these customers, they

456
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:54,969
will come to a different provider.

457
00:23:55,674 --> 00:23:58,284
different hosting company,
we are losing the clients.

458
00:23:58,284 --> 00:24:01,994
So we have minus one point and our
competitors are plus one point.

459
00:24:02,194 --> 00:24:05,774
So the distance between us
and our competitors are two

460
00:24:05,774 --> 00:24:07,914
points, everything due to that.

461
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:09,564
You didn't think about the use protection.

462
00:24:10,094 --> 00:24:12,884
that's a problem that the people
are still not thinking about the

463
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,264
use protection and that's crucial.

464
00:24:14,764 --> 00:24:18,514
So what to do, how to
survive in this cruel world?

465
00:24:19,014 --> 00:24:22,404
Stay with the G core , protecting
infrastructure with the G Core.

466
00:24:22,464 --> 00:24:26,004
So how, what we are using in
the G core, what's our, what's

467
00:24:26,004 --> 00:24:27,754
our, approach at the G core?

468
00:24:27,964 --> 00:24:32,434
So firstly, I want to show you
a quick video from the game,

469
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,484
from the inside the game.

470
00:24:33,544 --> 00:24:37,059
On the left side, you will
see the, the video on the game

471
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,679
server that is unprotected.

472
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:42,009
And on the right side, the
server that is under the DDoS

473
00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:43,209
protection from the G core side.

474
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:44,939
Game Counter Strike.

475
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:47,969
I think everyone played this
game or at least know this game.

476
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,589
So just please watch with me

477
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:55,359
As you can see on the left
side On the left side, we saw

478
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:56,939
that the screen was shaking.

479
00:24:56,949 --> 00:24:58,949
The player was just constantly lagging.

480
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:02,809
There was literally unable to
play What will be your experience

481
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:04,069
from playing on the laggy server?

482
00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:09,069
I think negative So you will just
let the server, let the game go

483
00:25:09,069 --> 00:25:10,999
to a different server Provider.

484
00:25:11,149 --> 00:25:15,529
Yeah, on the right side, smooth game,
no lags, everything was excellent.

485
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,419
So on the left side, okay,
what this person will think?

486
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:20,639
Okay, I don't want to play on the server.

487
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,429
I will go to a different server provider.

488
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:23,839
What about that?

489
00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:26,259
That will be totally two
different games maybe?

490
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:30,159
And what in case that from the first
one, that next game that is not under

491
00:25:30,189 --> 00:25:33,829
the users protection, the user will
decide to just leave the game, go

492
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:39,134
to a different game, and , he will
spend money on the different, on the

493
00:25:39,134 --> 00:25:40,784
different game, on the different server.

494
00:25:40,814 --> 00:25:44,954
So we always in clients due to that,
even if the server was still done up,

495
00:25:45,224 --> 00:25:49,304
server was still up, it was working,
it was partially responding, but

496
00:25:49,304 --> 00:25:51,484
it was lagging, extremely lagging.

497
00:25:51,574 --> 00:25:53,484
That's the issue going further.

498
00:25:53,984 --> 00:25:58,319
combining the web application protection
and the, and also the protecting

499
00:25:58,319 --> 00:25:59,579
the infrastructure is crucial.

500
00:25:59,954 --> 00:26:00,294
Why?

501
00:26:00,804 --> 00:26:04,014
Because, okay, we have the
Layer 3, Layer 4 and Layer 7.

502
00:26:04,194 --> 00:26:06,914
Protecting the infrastructure on the,
protecting the infrastructure on the

503
00:26:07,004 --> 00:26:10,824
Layer 3, Layer 4 is different than
protecting the web application layer.

504
00:26:11,264 --> 00:26:15,769
When you have here, for example, on this
slide, we have the , HTP flood attack.

505
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:17,869
We have excellent web application.

506
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:19,969
Firewall is blocking everything great.

507
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:24,739
We allow only valid HTP requests that will
come to our end point endpoint server.

508
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:25,849
Excellent.

509
00:26:25,969 --> 00:26:31,279
And in the same time, attacker recognize
that, okay, we are in this network.

510
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:33,049
We have in this day, we
are in the data center.

511
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:36,049
This is our server, and he's
attacking our infrastructure

512
00:26:36,109 --> 00:26:37,249
on the layer free layer four.

513
00:26:38,664 --> 00:26:39,654
Our server will survive?

514
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:40,574
I don't think so.

515
00:26:40,964 --> 00:26:43,324
We can have the best web
application firewall.

516
00:26:43,414 --> 00:26:47,144
We have, we can have 20 different
web applications from a firewall,

517
00:26:47,504 --> 00:26:48,854
each one behind each one.

518
00:26:49,354 --> 00:26:52,564
But when we don't have the, any
protection for the infrastructure,

519
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:54,024
our server will be down.

520
00:26:54,104 --> 00:26:55,349
Everything will be down.

521
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:58,829
Because, the server will be down
late on the, due to the attacks

522
00:26:58,829 --> 00:26:59,869
of the layer three, layer four.

523
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:05,169
layer seven will have nothing to do with
it because there will be no server to,

524
00:27:05,219 --> 00:27:07,719
to proceed the layer seven requests.

525
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:12,089
So this is why you need the,
protecting, you need to protect also

526
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:16,109
the infrastructure protection on the
layer three, layer four, in the same

527
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,269
time, protecting the web application.

528
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:20,379
So we need to protect
layer three, layer four.

529
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:27,103
Also, layer seven, what in case that you
have the game server, this is example from

530
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:32,713
the slide, what in case that you have the
game server and also the web shop that is

531
00:27:32,733 --> 00:27:36,713
associated with this game server on the
same machine, you need to protect both.

532
00:27:36,793 --> 00:27:38,993
You can't protect only the web server.

533
00:27:39,063 --> 00:27:39,283
And.

534
00:27:40,248 --> 00:27:43,828
will leave the game server
without the protection and

535
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,118
protect only the web application.

536
00:27:45,118 --> 00:27:49,818
You can't do that because the attacker,
I'm more than sure they will check and

537
00:27:49,818 --> 00:27:51,908
they will attack both in the same time.

538
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:56,468
And they will check which one
is down due to the attack.

539
00:27:56,528 --> 00:28:00,228
And later on they will constantly
attack that one part that is

540
00:28:00,238 --> 00:28:01,638
vulnerable without the protection.

541
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:07,858
So that's the problem and this is why
you need to protect the web application

542
00:28:07,858 --> 00:28:12,648
and also the infrastructure G Corp,
provides the comprehensive solution.

543
00:28:12,648 --> 00:28:16,838
You have the multi layer defense,
so we can protect against everything

544
00:28:17,168 --> 00:28:19,878
we can protect against layer
three, layer four, we can protect

545
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,298
against the layer seven attacks.

546
00:28:21,748 --> 00:28:24,948
We have everything that is available.

547
00:28:25,228 --> 00:28:29,248
I think what we don't have, maybe
it's only some future technologies,

548
00:28:29,258 --> 00:28:31,958
but to be honest, we have the
AI and I think soon maybe.

549
00:28:32,528 --> 00:28:36,298
We have, we are working, constantly
on the good AI and I think, even

550
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:39,508
we'll have technologies from the
future that no one ever will have.

551
00:28:40,058 --> 00:28:42,278
first, let's take a look
on the access control.

552
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:45,078
What in case that we have the two
different, two different servers,

553
00:28:45,118 --> 00:28:48,123
game servers, one server in the US
and second one server in the Europe.

554
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:55,363
Firstly, on the server in the US, we want
this server to the users to play on the

555
00:28:55,383 --> 00:28:59,003
from the US like the players from the
US and play on the servers in the US.

556
00:28:59,033 --> 00:29:02,463
And for this server, we are
blocking access to the traffic

557
00:29:02,463 --> 00:29:03,633
from the outside the US.

558
00:29:03,853 --> 00:29:06,493
Great, because from the data, from
the security point of view, we are

559
00:29:06,493 --> 00:29:08,313
just blocking most of the work.

560
00:29:08,718 --> 00:29:13,588
So most of the attacks from the other
countries won't be able to, reach our

561
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:17,268
server because on the DDoS site we'll just
block this, we'll make it go blocking.

562
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:19,008
And the same for the Europe.

563
00:29:19,138 --> 00:29:22,038
Traffic from the Europe stay in Europe,
traffic from the US stay in the US.

564
00:29:22,338 --> 00:29:23,538
Right on, we have the right meaning.

565
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:26,598
Let's say that we need some limitations.

566
00:29:26,728 --> 00:29:28,038
Let's say we have the Minecraft server.

567
00:29:28,218 --> 00:29:30,828
Minecraft server, normal user,
let's say, can create maximum

568
00:29:30,828 --> 00:29:32,748
5 connections in the same time.

569
00:29:33,068 --> 00:29:35,838
So let's make a hard cap,
6 connections per user.

570
00:29:36,448 --> 00:29:37,208
on our server.

571
00:29:37,438 --> 00:29:41,898
Okay, great, because we are limiting
the number of the requests that

572
00:29:41,918 --> 00:29:43,308
one user will be able to perform.

573
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:47,128
Backing to the previous slide,
we had the connection attacks.

574
00:29:47,838 --> 00:29:51,478
From this part, we are complete, we are
safe because we are protecting against

575
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:54,638
such type of the attacks because we are
blocking the number of the requests,

576
00:29:55,188 --> 00:29:59,488
number of the connections that the
attacker will be able to perform, reducing

577
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:02,498
the, the power of the attack in case
that we'll have something like that.

578
00:30:02,578 --> 00:30:05,138
Later on, we have, let's
say, the packet validation.

579
00:30:05,528 --> 00:30:09,878
In what in case that we don't want
to, proceed by our server, some of the

580
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:12,158
packets that they are like corrupted.

581
00:30:12,588 --> 00:30:13,888
Let's say the network.

582
00:30:14,358 --> 00:30:17,328
On the network side, there
was some malfunctions.

583
00:30:17,328 --> 00:30:20,418
So there, there was like some device,
network device was not working correctly.

584
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:23,238
Some H route was not working
correctly on one of the ISP.

585
00:30:23,478 --> 00:30:23,838
Okay.

586
00:30:24,258 --> 00:30:27,468
We don't want to provide such packets
because we are not sure that if this

587
00:30:27,468 --> 00:30:31,178
is the normal packet or maybe this
is the packet that they are sent by

588
00:30:31,178 --> 00:30:35,828
attacker and they are just looking
like they are, not fully good.

589
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:38,208
there is something wrong in this
packet, so let's block them.

590
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:39,288
Yeah, why not?

591
00:30:39,608 --> 00:30:44,328
The game will work, players will
be able to play, because we'll just

592
00:30:44,338 --> 00:30:46,608
proceed only with the valid packet.

593
00:30:47,463 --> 00:30:50,193
Later on, we have the machine
learning, behavior analyze.

594
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:53,713
Okay, what in case that we have in
this game, we have the web shop.

595
00:30:53,743 --> 00:30:55,973
We have the web shop that
will be inside this game.

596
00:30:55,973 --> 00:30:59,743
Like inside the pop up, the
screen, the web browser that

597
00:30:59,743 --> 00:31:01,093
will be open inside the game.

598
00:31:01,643 --> 00:31:02,233
It's possible.

599
00:31:02,673 --> 00:31:06,433
let's say, And in this web, in
this web, in this webshop, players

600
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:09,533
can buy some, let's say, some
skins, some items in the game.

601
00:31:09,893 --> 00:31:11,663
Everything is connected with the account.

602
00:31:11,713 --> 00:31:13,653
Maybe you can add the credit card there.

603
00:31:13,703 --> 00:31:14,753
this is a huge machine.

604
00:31:15,243 --> 00:31:16,093
Everything is there.

605
00:31:16,143 --> 00:31:17,403
Everything is inside the game.

606
00:31:17,623 --> 00:31:18,973
And we have the connection, everything.

607
00:31:19,353 --> 00:31:23,683
Our infrastructure, web application, and
also, players were able to pay there.

608
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:24,343
Okay.

609
00:31:25,073 --> 00:31:29,663
And here we have someone that is adding
constantly 10, 000 things to the cart.

610
00:31:30,163 --> 00:31:31,403
Okay, that's not normal.

611
00:31:31,663 --> 00:31:33,223
And here we have the behavior analyze.

612
00:31:33,523 --> 00:31:37,533
So we can check if this is normal
user or maybe this is not normal user.

613
00:31:37,533 --> 00:31:40,513
I don't think so that normal
user will add 10, 000 different

614
00:31:40,553 --> 00:31:42,653
items to the cart constantly.

615
00:31:43,013 --> 00:31:43,843
This is not normal.

616
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:48,983
And here we have the behavior analyze
and our web can just block it based on

617
00:31:48,983 --> 00:31:53,173
the behavior analyze because this is
not normal behavior for the normal user.

618
00:31:53,673 --> 00:31:55,813
So this is like a huge.

619
00:31:56,713 --> 00:31:59,813
With this approach that we have
in the G Core, you are able, we

620
00:31:59,813 --> 00:32:03,253
are protected against the layer
3, layer 4 attacks because the

621
00:32:03,253 --> 00:32:04,683
infrastructure is fully protected.

622
00:32:04,993 --> 00:32:09,133
We are protecting against some,
against the other attacks based

623
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:10,423
on the signature analyzing.

624
00:32:10,603 --> 00:32:12,233
We are protecting against the attacks.

625
00:32:12,373 --> 00:32:15,643
And for example, the behavior,
use behavior analyze.

626
00:32:16,413 --> 00:32:17,093
So this is huge.

627
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:18,313
So we are fully protected.

628
00:32:18,983 --> 00:32:21,603
Everything in one place,
everything is global.

629
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:25,343
You can do it everywhere,
every, on each server.

630
00:32:25,898 --> 00:32:27,358
So everything is fully automated.

631
00:32:27,508 --> 00:32:31,328
You can use everything from the
set up everything from the home.

632
00:32:32,028 --> 00:32:32,618
Excellent.

633
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:36,418
So later on we have the DDoS protection.

634
00:32:36,468 --> 00:32:37,238
We have the WAP.

635
00:32:37,518 --> 00:32:38,608
And also we have the CDN.

636
00:32:38,758 --> 00:32:39,678
When can you have this?

637
00:32:39,928 --> 00:32:42,478
let's say the example from the
previous slide, this webshop

638
00:32:42,478 --> 00:32:43,348
that is inside the game.

639
00:32:43,538 --> 00:32:47,878
Okay, maybe we have the servers
across the whole world and we want

640
00:32:47,908 --> 00:32:52,438
to just reduce the latency that the
users are expecting, that they are

641
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:54,008
having in this webshop to minimum.

642
00:32:54,248 --> 00:32:55,228
So we can use the CDN.

643
00:32:55,228 --> 00:32:59,298
We don't use the CDN from the provider
that we are already using the WAF

644
00:32:59,338 --> 00:33:00,768
and this, and the DDoS protection.

645
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:02,118
Everything is working correctly.

646
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:03,958
Everything in one place.

647
00:33:03,978 --> 00:33:05,248
Everything is working correctly.

648
00:33:05,528 --> 00:33:06,178
And also.

649
00:33:06,633 --> 00:33:10,023
We have the DDoS protection
and the web also for the CDN.

650
00:33:10,603 --> 00:33:11,483
Wow, looks good.

651
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:15,953
I don't think so that someone, some
attackers when they will see that

652
00:33:16,713 --> 00:33:21,363
they can't break the layer freely for
protection on the infrastructure level.

653
00:33:21,393 --> 00:33:24,443
They can break the web application and
they see right now, okay, the customer,

654
00:33:24,553 --> 00:33:27,343
this person is also using the CDN.

655
00:33:27,343 --> 00:33:29,973
Let's just leave and try to
find another person to attack.

656
00:33:30,473 --> 00:33:34,518
Our CDN is also fully protected
against the DDoS attacks.

657
00:33:35,288 --> 00:33:39,238
So it means that we are protecting
against the DDoS attack with the CDN

658
00:33:39,378 --> 00:33:40,688
with the content that you never network.

659
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:46,008
We are also able to deliver everything
to our customers with the lowest latency.

660
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:50,618
So it means that if normally, let's say
the web shop will be loading in five

661
00:33:50,618 --> 00:33:54,358
minutes, five minutes, three minutes,
maybe two minutes, because there will

662
00:33:54,358 --> 00:33:58,168
be a lot of pictures, videos, maybe on
the website or something like that with

663
00:33:58,178 --> 00:34:00,418
the CDN, it will load in 10 seconds.

664
00:34:01,178 --> 00:34:01,558
Why?

665
00:34:01,628 --> 00:34:02,228
This is huge.

666
00:34:02,268 --> 00:34:03,688
This is huge reducing, let's say.

667
00:34:04,188 --> 00:34:08,908
I don't think so that, users will say that
the loading as loading time three minutes

668
00:34:08,938 --> 00:34:13,648
is better than 10 seconds, or maybe
one, maybe 30 seconds, even 20 seconds.

669
00:34:14,148 --> 00:34:16,208
So this is everything.

670
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,938
That's everything that we
are providing in the G Core.

671
00:34:18,938 --> 00:34:23,508
So we have the DDoS protection WAF, and
also we can combine the WAF and DDoS.

672
00:34:23,858 --> 00:34:27,038
Inside the CDN, so we have we can
protect you against everything.

673
00:34:27,058 --> 00:34:28,728
We can protect the infrastructure.

674
00:34:28,738 --> 00:34:31,258
We can protect the web application layer.

675
00:34:31,908 --> 00:34:33,678
That's looks good to be honest.

676
00:34:34,178 --> 00:34:36,438
We have many companies, that trust us.

677
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:40,708
We have many companies,
many hosting providers.

678
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:42,868
We have many games that we are protecting.

679
00:34:43,578 --> 00:34:45,958
Everyone is like happy from using us.

680
00:34:46,308 --> 00:34:50,248
I'm more than sure that at least a few
websites that you visited, last time and

681
00:34:50,258 --> 00:34:55,478
few games servers that you played and few
games that you played are protected by us.

682
00:34:55,788 --> 00:34:59,038
And I'm more than sure you
expect you had there zero lags,

683
00:34:59,218 --> 00:35:00,708
zero issues with everything.

684
00:35:01,548 --> 00:35:04,178
I hope you enjoy the talk.
