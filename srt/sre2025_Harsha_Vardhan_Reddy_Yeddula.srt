00:00:32,839 --> 00:00:36,860
And computer vision, performance
metrics and integrated a platforms

10
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,635
and automation, economic impact of
a insurance and future of yay and

11
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:45,565
insurance underwriting, SharePoint,
AI transformation collaboration.

12
00:00:45,925 --> 00:00:48,140
And these are all the
topics that we are going to.

13
00:00:48,635 --> 00:00:54,105
Talk in this session and how we see
between this traditional methods

14
00:00:54,165 --> 00:00:58,705
and as well as this transformation
between this, what are the benefits,

15
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:03,595
what is the accuracy and what is how
the under underwritings are going

16
00:01:03,595 --> 00:01:08,155
without the paperless, we'll all see
this features, session this Microsoft

17
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:10,205
Cloud AI next generation session.

18
00:01:10,545 --> 00:01:13,875
The insurance industry is experiencing
performed digital transformation.

19
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,040
Through a integration fundamentally
reshaping traditional business models

20
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,660
and operational processes with the
global insurance, yay Investments, and

21
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:31,020
it's reaching 21 billion in 2023, and
the predictions of 45 billion in 2027.

22
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,390
The insurance industry is recognizing
a potential to revolutionizing the

23
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,500
core processes in today's world,
the insurance carriers implementing

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,390
AI driven underwriting systems.

25
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,860
Having a reported of 40% risk reduction
in the risk assessment time, and 60% of

26
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,730
decrease in the processing cost and 35%
improvement in the loss ratio production.

27
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:59,000
Sir, these systems can these systems
can also analyze over 200 unique data

28
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,880
points per application in real time.

29
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:05,955
Compared to 40 to 50 points in the
traditional underwriting, and this

30
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:10,695
is all about the key highlight of the
insurance in the industry, then now

31
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:15,375
we will go by one section how we can
leverage the benefits of using this

32
00:02:15,705 --> 00:02:21,395
gen features in the insurance coming to
this core core machine learning models.

33
00:02:21,395 --> 00:02:22,445
In the risk assessment.

34
00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:24,875
Here we talk about, three models.

35
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:29,054
One is a random forest, one is a
logistic regression, and one is

36
00:02:29,054 --> 00:02:30,715
the gradient boosting mechanic.

37
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:35,575
When coming to this random forest the
achieving the accuracy rate is like

38
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,875
above 85% in risk classification.

39
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:43,945
Significantly outperforming that
traditional actuarial methods can

40
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:47,845
process up to 75 unique features
per assessment with the optimal

41
00:02:47,845 --> 00:02:49,705
performance through hundred to.

42
00:02:49,945 --> 00:02:54,855
One 20 decision enables and coming
to this logistic logistic regression,

43
00:02:54,855 --> 00:03:00,375
this logistic ion maintains over 78%
of accuracy rate while providing the

44
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:05,685
complete algorithm transparency for
regulatory compliance, delivering

45
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,115
28% in the improvement of the risk.

46
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:12,405
Of the risk of segmentation accuracy
com compared to the conventional methods

47
00:03:12,465 --> 00:03:17,295
when it come to the gradient boosting
mechanism, boost things implementation.

48
00:03:17,295 --> 00:03:20,835
This kind of machine learning
model achieve 90% of perception

49
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:22,605
in the risk classification.

50
00:03:22,605 --> 00:03:29,085
While maintaining the real processing
speeds can efficiently analyze over 300

51
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:31,095
distinct features per application In.

52
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:32,790
30 seconds.

53
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,410
Now coming to the next topic of the
neural networks in insurance, the neural

54
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:42,390
networks particularly is nothing but
an advanced learning architectures have

55
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,440
transformed how the insurance processes
of the unstructured data during the

56
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,665
underwriting, this cutting edging
conventional na natural networks deployed

57
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:54,305
in properly incidents Now identify.

58
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,650
Potential risk factors from the visual
data with above 91% accuracy, seamlessly

59
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,230
processing 77 50 property images
daily, while dramatically reducing

60
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,550
the need for the human review, the
deep learning experience, the deep

61
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,050
learning excellent unstructured data
processing and structured data analyst.

62
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,680
We'll see how it happens, the
accuracy rate and the processing

63
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,910
and the risk classification.

64
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,940
In each here in the deep learning
excellence, we will see over

65
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,590
91% of accuracy in the risk
assessment, unstructured data

66
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,330
processing seven 50 images daily.

67
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:32,970
This is what, how the neural networks,
if we implement certain in the insurance

68
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,310
practices, we can achieve these targets.

69
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,750
Like a structured data analysis.

70
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,560
Over 86% of risk class
classification accuracy.

71
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,530
This is how the neural networks
that helps in the insurance industry

72
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,830
for the deep learning, unstructured
data processing, unstructured data

73
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,010
analysis with the accuracy rate.

74
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,950
Now coming to the natural language
processing in document analysis, this

75
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,850
is very important because the reduction
in reduction in manual review time.

76
00:05:01,525 --> 00:05:05,585
Be model accuracy named entity
rec recognition accuracy.

77
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:10,385
So now coming to this reduction in manual
review term, it's not only about how

78
00:05:10,385 --> 00:05:15,145
the AA features are utilizing it also
should have a manual review review term

79
00:05:15,145 --> 00:05:20,380
reduction, and that how source this in
LP system process, like a tool k plus.

80
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,530
Pages daily, over 300 pages when
we compare with the traditional

81
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,920
manual methods when coming to this
bet model accuracy for extracting

82
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,360
the critical information from the
policy documents and when it comes

83
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,050
to the na named entity recognition.

84
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:36,955
Accuracy.

85
00:05:37,195 --> 00:05:42,140
It is about 94 percentage in identifying
and categorizing the key entities

86
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,730
with the insurance documentation.

87
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,230
The insurance underwriting's reliance
on document processing has been

88
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,600
revolutionized by the NLP models.

89
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,710
Be based models, trained
on 2.5 million insurance.

90
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:00,310
Documents can analyze a standard 25
page policy in just a few seconds,

91
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,090
just like 20 seconds comp compared
to 52 minutes of the traditional

92
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,300
methods while maintaining accuracy.

93
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,010
While maintaining the accuracy levels.

94
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,360
About 85%.

95
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:15,335
Even with the complex riders and
endorsements, and this is one of the

96
00:06:15,385 --> 00:06:19,075
beautiful natural language processing
in the document analysis that helps

97
00:06:19,075 --> 00:06:23,695
in the insurance industries though,
N-L-P-N-L-P performance metrics in.

98
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,000
Insurance.

99
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,810
The here, the main five topics that
we models we are going to talk is

100
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,250
like the beta document analysis,
technical inter interpretations,

101
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,520
the cover gap detection and the NER
systems in coming to this section.

102
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,159
The first topic, like B-R-T-B-E-R-T
document analysis, over 90% of accuracy

103
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:46,175
rate with 20 seconds around like eight 18.

104
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,580
18 to 20 seconds per document
and the 85% reduction in compared

105
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,600
to the manual processing.

106
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,510
The technical term interpretation.

107
00:06:54,540 --> 00:07:00,540
93 per 93 percentage of accuracy rate
processing over eight 50 documents per

108
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,840
72% of reduction in the processing time.

109
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:08,940
Cover gap detections, the accuracy
rate will be over 90% and eight

110
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,130
50 documents processed to cost to
savings will be like a three, two.

111
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,890
$4 per document.

112
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:21,570
Iner systems accuracy date will be
94% rate and 8,000 documents processed

113
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,400
daily using this INER system.

114
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,940
And the cost savings also like
amazing, like a four around

115
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,600
like five $5 per document.

116
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Pre coming to the next section, how
this pre predictive predictive analysis

117
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,180
and the fraud detection this in this
things, in this predictive analysis on

118
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,840
fraud detection, we will talk about like
advanced predictive models time series

119
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,450
analysis and graph neural networks.

120
00:07:45,955 --> 00:07:49,115
And auto auto encoder integrations.

121
00:07:49,205 --> 00:07:51,525
This this advanced
advanced predictive models.

122
00:07:51,575 --> 00:07:52,924
We see this reduction.

123
00:07:52,924 --> 00:07:58,474
It is just like 36% reduction in the
combined loss ratios and 41 point

124
00:07:59,004 --> 00:08:04,044
two percentage improvement in the
risk assessment precisions the time

125
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:10,254
series analysis, over 84.8 percentage
of accuracy in predicting claim.

126
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:15,239
Occurrence within the first 24
first 12 months of policy insurance

127
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:20,999
graph neural networks, over 71% of
implementing fraud detection rates while

128
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:23,549
reducing the false positives by 62%.

129
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:25,649
Auto encoder integration.

130
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:31,199
Over 90% of accuracy in identifying
unknown mollusk claim patents while

131
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,155
processing 65,000 claims daily.

132
00:08:35,385 --> 00:08:37,964
And when we come to this
predictive analysis on fraud

133
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:40,004
detection, this plays a key role.

134
00:08:40,065 --> 00:08:45,825
This plays a key role when we are using
the a AI features in the insurance ancy

135
00:08:45,855 --> 00:08:50,625
or in any other industry that deals
with the most of the content management

136
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:54,944
and the document management where the
A underwriters or the officers will

137
00:08:54,944 --> 00:09:00,345
be using on today, day-to-day basis
for collecting the meta content and

138
00:09:00,345 --> 00:09:02,774
metadata from the actual business users.

139
00:09:04,185 --> 00:09:08,574
Coming to the next topic, the computer
Vision in property assessment in, and

140
00:09:08,604 --> 00:09:10,854
this is not only about the insurance.

141
00:09:10,854 --> 00:09:16,014
We have something like property casualty,
specialty casualty, the Iron Show in

142
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,634
a different models of the insurance.

143
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:21,384
When it comes to the property assessment,
the computer with the AI feature, the

144
00:09:21,384 --> 00:09:26,814
computer vision in property assessment has
like drastically showing the improvements.

145
00:09:26,844 --> 00:09:28,194
One is the image capture.

146
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:31,314
One is the cost estimation,
one is the future detection and

147
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:33,294
one is the damage assessment.

148
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:37,905
It's not only about a small property
like a home or this it also deals with

149
00:09:37,905 --> 00:09:41,705
this like the, a deals with the the
big system like the very San Francisco

150
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:43,325
Bridge or the New York Bridges.

151
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:46,925
The, were big malls in the New York, the
big buildings in the New York and San

152
00:09:46,925 --> 00:09:48,755
Francisco and other parts of the country.

153
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:52,015
When we have a huge like
billions of the properties.

154
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:56,015
And that also helps this AI also
helps in that assessing with through

155
00:09:56,015 --> 00:09:57,425
the computer vision in the property.

156
00:09:57,425 --> 00:09:57,935
Assessment.

157
00:09:58,204 --> 00:10:00,635
One is image captured here
in this image capture.

158
00:10:00,635 --> 00:10:05,555
We'll discuss it process inserts with
the ultra high resolution property

159
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:08,405
images enabling the detailed analysis.

160
00:10:08,465 --> 00:10:11,295
They're now coming to the
feature feature detection.

161
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:18,060
Advanced yolo VFI and Foster CNN
algorithms identify 180 5 distant

162
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:24,990
property features with 87%, 87.4%
perceptions and damage assessment.

163
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:30,240
Specialized CNN models achieve
over 90% accuracy in identifying

164
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,610
structural damage, CBRT and extent.

165
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,540
Revolutionary, revolutionary computer
vision systems have slashed the property

166
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:43,270
assessment time by 70%, over 70%,
while simultaneously initially boosting

167

traditional human inspections.

173
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:14,040
The computer vision performance metrics,
it's not only about computer vision

174
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:19,020
in the management system, it be how
to check, like how the computer vision

175
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:23,520
has the performance metrics, how we
can calculate that, how we can, because

176
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,870
the metrics is the one thing that shows
the graphical representation where to

00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,970
And automation.

201
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,830
The robotic process of automation one
is policy renewal processing the price

202
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,810
optimization market segment optimizations.

203
00:13:14,475 --> 00:13:18,705
Here in this robotic process of
automation, it achieves industry

204
00:13:18,705 --> 00:13:24,405
leading 97% is accuracy in automated

time by 72 point.

207
00:13:30,365 --> 00:13:34,915
5% and maintaining the
error rates below 0.5%.

208
00:13:34,945 --> 00:13:38,875
And when it comes to policy renewal
processing, it's not about only

209
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:44,705
the policy or the claims or the
underwritings it's also about the renewal.

210
00:13:45,135 --> 00:13:45,825
Process, right?

211
00:13:46,155 --> 00:13:50,535
Any policy is getting renewed within
a 12 months or 18 months based

212
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:54,285
on the policy inspection date and
the policy inspection end date.

213
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:59,235
So the policy should get automatically
go for the renewal, so the

214
00:13:59,235 --> 00:14:06,165
dramatically cuts processing times
from 22.8 hours to just 18 minutes

215
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:12,135
per policy while sustain sustaining
98% accuracy, efficiently handling.
