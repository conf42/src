1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,510
Thanks for joining my presentation,
Secrets Revealed, for launching

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,720
a successful DevSecOps program.

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,129
In this talk, I'll be taking you on
a journey of standing up this program

4
00:00:10,129 --> 00:00:14,149
in an enterprise setting from scratch,
and then revealing the secrets along

5
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:16,790
the way to my success of this program.

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,990
At the bottom corner, you see a picture of
me, and the right is my LinkedIn contact,

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:21,990
if you'd like to LinkedIn with me.

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,990
Here's the agenda for the talk.

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,210
I'll go over the goals I had for the
main parties involved in this new,

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,980
program, the engagement strategy, how I
got buy in from the, key stakeholders.

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,650
First, the highlights, and I'll reveal
the success patterns, and I'll close

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,430
things out with how, SBOM will shape next
steps in the maturity model of DevSecOps.

13
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,710
When I first got this project,
and scanning up this new program

14
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,330
and the enterprise, I thought to
myself, what does good look like?

15
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:54,300
DevSecOps.

16
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,650
What do I want this to be?

17
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,860
I thought about, you know, the course
I've been working nearly 30 years.

18
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,459
When we did these type of things,
all the places I've worked, what

19
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,570
went well and what didn't go so well.

20
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,670
And that's a lot of thinking about that.

21
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:12,270
And I decided that things had to
go a little bit differently if

22
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,510
this was going to be successful.

23
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,680
Obviously, I have to involve the
DevSec developers, the security, and

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,670
the operations or IT operations group.

25
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,670
So I came up with this mission statement
that DevSecOps for the company I was

26
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,579
working at when I was doing this would
be a successful marriage of IT operations

27
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:35,950
and security enabling developers to
deliver products for the business in

28
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,170
a secure manner without any friction
to their ways of working and while

29
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,550
they're doing their other daily work.

30
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,050
So first, the goals.

31
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,760
I have this broken down by the
three main players, developers,

32
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,540
security, and of course IT operations.

33
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,170
So the goals for the developers,
again I alluded to this before, I

34
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,220
wanted this to be as frictionless
as possible for them to adopt.

35
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:02,510
I use this mantra a lot, that secure
coding is a form of code quality.

36
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,200
We weren't introducing
new, ways of working.

37
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,379
It's just, let's try to focus
on making the code, when it's

38
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,090
delivered, have less defect.

39
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,070
And also prevent rework from
deployment, before deployment.

40
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,200
And continue to deliver stable
and secure products, not just for

41
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,670
external customers, but also for
the, the main company as well.

42
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,870
at the time we were transitioning to this
newfangled thing called the cloud and

43
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,500
whatever we could do now to make sure that
the patterns that we came up for pipelines

44
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,170
and et cetera could easily transition
to that platform and a place where I

45
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,090
worked before what I said was analytics,
there's always a focus on automation.

46
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,659
What can we do now and in the future?

47
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,420
Secondly, what goals
do I have for my team?

48
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,880
Well, I obviously wanted to decrease
the application attack surface.

49
00:02:47,705 --> 00:02:50,875
And, a fun statement about that
when we talk about decreasing the

50
00:02:50,885 --> 00:02:55,864
application attack surface, it's kind
of, I kind of liken it to when people

51
00:02:55,864 --> 00:02:57,245
say, hey, I want to lose 10 pounds.

52
00:02:57,375 --> 00:03:02,404
Well, when people say that they want to
lose 10 pounds, but they also mean I want

53
00:03:02,404 --> 00:03:04,305
to lose 10 pounds and keep 10 pounds off.

54
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:07,665
So in terms of the application
attack surface, I want to decrease

55
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:10,655
my application attack surface and
not have it grow for many other

56
00:03:10,665 --> 00:03:12,465
software app vulnerabilities as well.

57
00:03:13,015 --> 00:03:17,394
I want to mitigate the chances of
any breaches or outages while we're

58
00:03:17,415 --> 00:03:21,305
emphasizing this new form of code
quality with security in the foreground.

59
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:25,525
And I used a blend of a, or a blend
or approach of bend, but don't

60
00:03:25,525 --> 00:03:27,105
break for the security approach.

61
00:03:27,645 --> 00:03:32,524
So if we had to be a little bit less
structured or, not as rigid with

62
00:03:32,524 --> 00:03:36,704
our security approach for certain
items, we had to be flexible.

63
00:03:36,795 --> 00:03:40,725
I would challenge my team to think in
terms of what detective, preventative,

64
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:44,475
and corrective controls we put in
place to mitigate any of those things

65
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:48,635
that were going on from a software or
pipeline perspective from a bending,

66
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:51,535
but not only throwing the baby out
with the bath water and not breaking,

67
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:57,544
of course, always a focus on automate
and closing out this piece, for it ops.

68
00:03:58,044 --> 00:04:00,964
I wanted their daily operations
work not to be interrupted.

69
00:04:01,404 --> 00:04:02,734
I had an empowerment focus.

70
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:04,684
I just didn't want to shove
tools down their throat.

71
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:08,454
I wanted them to have a say into
it doesn't mean they had the final,

72
00:04:08,554 --> 00:04:10,455
call, but I did want their input.

73
00:04:10,955 --> 00:04:16,184
And also, frame this in terms of,
upscale opportunity, not just from

74
00:04:16,184 --> 00:04:19,664
new tools or platforms, but also from
a new way of working DevSecOps at

75
00:04:19,664 --> 00:04:22,554
that time was becoming very hot and
you need to get on board with it.

76
00:04:22,744 --> 00:04:23,034
Right.

77
00:04:23,534 --> 00:04:24,834
And of course, automate.

78
00:04:24,874 --> 00:04:25,634
What can we focus on?

79
00:04:25,684 --> 00:04:27,454
Focus on automation now and the future.

80
00:04:27,954 --> 00:04:28,574
Moving on.

81
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:33,264
So how did I get buy in and what was my
strategy for engaging all these people?

82
00:04:33,764 --> 00:04:37,754
So I focused on the engineering
management, getting alignment with them.

83
00:04:38,374 --> 00:04:42,844
the second piece is really a foundational
piece I think anybody can do in their org.

84
00:04:43,754 --> 00:04:46,554
Education and outreach
and then matrix teams.

85
00:04:47,044 --> 00:04:51,354
to be honest, I didn't know that
was going to be such a secret sauce

86
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,304
that I was going to rely on towards
the end that really came through.

87
00:04:54,404 --> 00:04:54,664
So,

88
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:57,814
so how did I get, engineering
management alignment?

89
00:04:57,934 --> 00:05:01,074
So it was, this was at the
beginning of the year and we had

90
00:05:01,074 --> 00:05:04,504
a focus, we're developing our,
performance goals and objectives.

91
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,714
I had some meetings with some
of the VPs of software dev

92
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:08,914
and engineering, et cetera.

93
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:13,684
I wanted to make, security
a form of code quality.

94
00:05:13,874 --> 00:05:18,354
That was a goal, that would be
cascaded down to their direct

95
00:05:18,354 --> 00:05:19,564
reports and all the individual.

96
00:05:20,064 --> 00:05:23,045
So, you'll find out why, in
a second, why it's important.

97
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:28,815
Oh, I also did, address the budget
barrier in terms of, If I'm asking these

98
00:05:28,835 --> 00:05:34,755
developers to operate in a different
way to look for, for fixed security

99
00:05:34,755 --> 00:05:40,415
vulnerabilities or code vulnerabilities
rather before they get into production, I

100
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:41,925
need to give them some adequate training.

101
00:05:42,195 --> 00:05:43,635
So I talked to finance.

102
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:44,895
I told them what I was doing.

103
00:05:44,895 --> 00:05:46,330
They knew about the DevSecOps program.

104
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,215
I was able to secure X number of dollars
for training just for the developers

105
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:51,945
and other folks that would need it.

106
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:55,445
I wanted to make sure it didn't come
out of my team's training budget and

107
00:05:55,445 --> 00:05:57,145
not out of, engineering training budget.

108
00:05:57,645 --> 00:05:59,235
And then I talked about the education.

109
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:03,165
I make sure they have the right,
the right patterns to deploy.

110
00:06:03,825 --> 00:06:04,595
So what does this do?

111
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:09,175
Well, the first ones got rid of, we don't
have time to do this DevSecOps initiative.

112
00:06:09,505 --> 00:06:11,955
Well, now it's a priority because
it's part of your goal and objective,

113
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:12,965
and you'll be graded on it.

114
00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:18,205
I even went as far to provide sample
SMART goals for the managers, such as,

115
00:06:18,565 --> 00:06:22,875
Hey, my team discovered X number of
insecure, codes that they've written.

116
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:25,605
And then they're able to, fix that
before it was pushed to the prod.

117
00:06:26,105 --> 00:06:30,275
From a budget perspective, that's the,
statement I would typically receive.

118
00:06:30,295 --> 00:06:32,185
We don't have money to
do this new initiative.

119
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:36,625
Well, I got training for you guys, and
I'll go through the education here, but

120
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:37,895
they didn't have to worry about that.

121
00:06:38,395 --> 00:06:40,375
And then this relieved that part.

122
00:06:40,425 --> 00:06:42,475
we don't know how to do this
effectively and efficiently, and

123
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:45,685
this is gonna slow down our work in
delivering, not just secure code,

124
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:46,975
but any type of code to our client.

125
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:51,345
Thought about the barriers, how to
address them to remove those obvious ones.

126
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:56,325
Now from an education approach in the
first year, I started off what was

127
00:06:56,325 --> 00:06:58,395
called the internal learning content.

128
00:06:58,445 --> 00:07:01,325
Every place I've worked there's been
an internal learning management system

129
00:07:01,365 --> 00:07:03,375
and you can generate content for that.

130
00:07:03,645 --> 00:07:08,045
So essentially what I did was I went
to OWASP, I got some short videos

131
00:07:08,075 --> 00:07:10,305
and content for them to go through.

132
00:07:11,035 --> 00:07:16,675
And in order for the developers
and data scientists, et cetera, to

133
00:07:16,675 --> 00:07:20,205
attend the on site training class,
which was the first thing I got for

134
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:22,415
them, they had to take this OWASP.

135
00:07:22,965 --> 00:07:25,395
it was basically 45 minutes.

136
00:07:26,085 --> 00:07:28,785
You could do it during lunch, but it
also told me who was going to have some

137
00:07:28,805 --> 00:07:33,385
skin in the game and also be more engaged
when they went to the training class.

138
00:07:33,885 --> 00:07:35,105
So I worked with one vendor.

139
00:07:35,115 --> 00:07:37,165
It was on site, as I alluded to.

140
00:07:37,195 --> 00:07:39,625
It was two days, 16 hours.

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,840
Eight hours a day, it was on site and
they came, the instructors came here, to

142
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:52,380
the office and I had about probably 40
to 50 developers, you know, engineering

143
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,570
type, data engineers, data scientists.

144
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,920
So it was good, from
the content was solid.

145
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,580
The vendor was great and this was a few
years ago and some of the other stuff that

146
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,250
I used down the road wasn't available.

147
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:04,420
But.

148
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:10,120
The, having developers always
think like web app pen testers

149
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,680
is not the easiest thing to do.

150
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,320
They need to write code and
they need to deliver it.

151
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,730
So, you'll probably get one or two people
that really gravitate to that model.

152
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,320
But at the end of the day, you need
to treat developers as developers.

153
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,220
I've seen work and have them
like look for these patterns.

154
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,020
They should not, probably should not write
their code from a security perspective.

155
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,130
after the class, I started what I
called a Lunch and Learn or Hack Club.

156
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,340
Gave it a sexy name so
people would attend.

157
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,400
so basically during.

158
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:39,925
The Hack Club sessions, I went through
the OWASP top 10 to reinforce concepts

159
00:08:39,925 --> 00:08:43,235
that they learned during the class
with the on site vendor, monthly.

160
00:08:43,925 --> 00:08:48,695
And that was well attended, and it
was a good refresh, and like I said,

161
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,945
I had not just, developers and data
engineers and et cetera, but also

162
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:53,485
a lot of IT people showed up to it.

163
00:08:53,985 --> 00:08:58,930
Now, the second year from an education
approach, I learned about this, item we

164
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,810
had called University Jumpstart Class.

165
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,160
And what you would think, people
fresh out of school or whatever.

166
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,130
I wanted them to make sure they knew
about the OWASP internal training path

167
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,630
and make that part of their curriculum.

168
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:14,160
I worked with another vendor, for a
different type of, training called

169
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,334
Modern Web App Pintesting, again.

170
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:19,445
Still web app, still web app pen testing.

171
00:09:19,945 --> 00:09:23,405
Still asking developers to think
like a pen tester and not just

172
00:09:23,405 --> 00:09:25,035
write secure code as you're going.

173
00:09:25,605 --> 00:09:26,845
The things to look at for.

174
00:09:27,355 --> 00:09:30,015
But this was a step up
because the content was good.

175
00:09:30,015 --> 00:09:33,345
It was some more modern languages and
frameworks they're used to, focusing on.

176
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,635
And secondly, the, it was remote.

177
00:09:36,635 --> 00:09:40,875
And it was still 16 hours,
but it was 4 hours a day.

178
00:09:41,235 --> 00:09:44,415
from 12 to four and for four days.

179
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:48,665
And so that was an easier pill to
swallow in terms of getting people to

180
00:09:48,695 --> 00:09:53,645
go, for moving that, Hey, I'm gonna
miss two days of work versus, well,

181
00:09:54,465 --> 00:09:56,435
I'm only missing four hours of work.

182
00:09:56,435 --> 00:09:58,755
And really it's three cause they're
doing part of it on their lunch hour.

183
00:09:59,195 --> 00:10:02,345
And so they're not so disengaged from
their work day and you're starting

184
00:10:02,345 --> 00:10:03,675
at 12 and you're ending at four.

185
00:10:03,675 --> 00:10:08,245
So that was well received and I, I got a
lot of good feedback in terms, not just

186
00:10:08,245 --> 00:10:11,135
from the individual contributors, but
also from their management in terms of.

187
00:10:11,705 --> 00:10:15,105
Hey, this content was good, it
was better, and I didn't have to

188
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,875
use so much of my work day time.

189
00:10:17,465 --> 00:10:21,765
So, making things better, from a
process improvement or curriculum

190
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:22,625
improvement perspective.

191
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:26,615
We continued the DevSecOps, or we
started this thing called DevSecOps

192
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:31,785
Office Hours Weekly, what it says,
if you had questions from a security

193
00:10:31,795 --> 00:10:36,115
operations perspective, or, needed
some help from, development, then.

194
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,865
but intertwined with those three
concepts, I had office hours.

195
00:10:39,865 --> 00:10:42,555
I had myself or some
representative from my team there.

196
00:10:42,555 --> 00:10:46,595
I also had some from a team called
platform that read all that ran all the I.

197
00:10:46,595 --> 00:10:46,815
T.

198
00:10:46,815 --> 00:10:50,745
ops, and so, you know, like
build team city and cetera.

199
00:10:51,335 --> 00:10:52,545
And they could ask questions.

200
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,855
Now, if it became something you really
had to focus on, we asked him to put

201
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:59,485
a ticket, but it was a quick way for
people to get feedback and answers.

202
00:10:59,505 --> 00:11:00,555
We're continuing to push.

203
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,340
This program, in the foreground
and keep it positive.

204
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,510
And then I found this other class, called
Application Security Foundations class.

205
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,650
This was exactly what I was looking.

206
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:14,020
the content was how to
write secure code and why.

207
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,210
And I was able to get them a
book from the author as well.

208
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,764
They could have a print or a digital book.

209
00:11:19,455 --> 00:11:22,785
But more importantly, it really,
it was written by a developer for

210
00:11:22,785 --> 00:11:26,205
developers how to write secure code
and how to find insecure code and the

211
00:11:26,205 --> 00:11:29,035
best way, and the best ways to fix
that where it was like libraries or

212
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,825
different rammer stations, et cetera.

213
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:37,245
This was met with very high success
and it was all done asynchronously.

214
00:11:37,255 --> 00:11:42,025
It was not done live, so they could work
at their own pace, but it had some skin in

215
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:43,485
the game when they had to get it done by.

216
00:11:43,935 --> 00:11:47,655
And there was actually, there More
classes too, and it's this one here

217
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:49,025
called Secure Coding Principles.

218
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:52,495
So once they got the AppSec, foundation
is done, then they could go to the

219
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:53,995
Secure Coding Principles class.

220
00:11:53,995 --> 00:11:56,775
also continue the Hack Club
Lunch and Learns, but this time

221
00:11:56,775 --> 00:11:59,915
since it was year two, I passed
it down to people in my team.

222
00:12:00,315 --> 00:12:03,925
So they could get some leadership,
build, learn how to run those meetings.

223
00:12:04,355 --> 00:12:05,595
a lot of them are remote.

224
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,010
And I made it part of their goals
and objectives that they had to run,

225
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,120
come up with content and lead one
of the Hack Club Lunch and Learns.

226
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:17,160
Now from the year three, round
this out, I passed 100 percent

227
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:21,440
off of the DevSecOps office hours
to one of the people on my team.

228
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,120
And I had some budget left over.

229
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:29,780
I brought the author in from that class
from the last one, application security.

230
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:31,905
coding classes in the books.

231
00:12:31,935 --> 00:12:33,275
I had her in a fireside chat.

232
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:34,005
It was virtual.

233
00:12:34,345 --> 00:12:38,765
it was about an hour and a half and I was
able to have developers and data engineers

234
00:12:38,795 --> 00:12:43,440
kind of pepper her with questions in
terms of, best practices and, things

235
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,190
they've run into and things that she's
seen in the field, it was well received.

236
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,330
Plus I had a fake fire, you know,
fireplace backgrounds that made it

237
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,140
cool, especially since it was in August.

238
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,050
So, moving on to matrix teams.

239
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,250
So, came up with this
concept of the star chamber.

240
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,210
And the mission statement was to drive
security throughout the dev process and

241
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,830
the pipelines, or CICD process pipelines.

242
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,470
By leveraging this group's
diverse skills and perspectives

243
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:14,230
to achieve, these outcomes for the
business, but in a secure manner.

244
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,080
So, there was this movie called
The Star Chamber, and these people

245
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,350
would get together and, make these
decisions when they're unhappy with

246
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,960
the law and kind of take action.

247
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,150
Old movie from the 80s, I think.

248
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:29,580
So, the group I developed and led
wasn't that McLevanian, but we still

249
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,300
did a lot of things behind the scenes
in terms of pushing the program ahead.

250
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:33,370
Thank you.

251
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,390
Here you'll see the members of
the start chamber engineering,

252
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,010
development, developer services.

253
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,900
I'll get to that in a second.

254
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:44,280
SREs, cyber level engineers,
platform secure or platform team.

255
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,900
And of course, IT security.

256
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,050
as I'll get to the, dev services
a little bit later in the talk.

257
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:54,550
the matrix teams, also started this group
called the security champions program.

258
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,480
And this is probably right now.

259
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,410
This concept is pretty ubiquitous
across bigger organizations.

260
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:00,950
I've seen.

261
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:05,980
With my clients, but this was probably
three years ago, that was a new

262
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,310
novel concept and not very well in
practice yet much, but essentially

263
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:14,080
these champions, was, push security
concepts or advertise them throughout

264
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,550
the respective dev workstreams.

265
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:20,100
He also created this sassity, teams
channel and get feedback quicker.

266
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,250
You can see the type of items we
have there and developer services.

267
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,450
What I alluded to before.

268
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:26,590
for listening.

269
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,730
It was a small group of developers.

270
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:29,940
This was, they already had this here.

271
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,900
I had nothing to do with it.

272
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,290
But I, I piggybacked off it.

273
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,310
They had these patterns
called paved roads.

274
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,350
and then, you know, if you follow these
paved roads, if you're a developer,

275
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,730
you know, everything should be hunky
dory and fine, and if you didn't, and

276
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,080
you didn't work, then you, your code
would not be blessed in production, etc.

277
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,100
So, infuse the secure coding principles
as part of their paved roads.

278
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,890
That was a good win.

279
00:14:51,685 --> 00:14:55,255
and they also had office hours too,
so I would join that as much as

280
00:14:55,255 --> 00:14:59,175
I could to hear what was going on
from, from a coding perspective.

281
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,845
I tried not to talk too much
because it wasn't my meeting.

282
00:15:02,895 --> 00:15:06,915
I only really said things in terms
of supporting what the leaders

283
00:15:06,915 --> 00:15:08,785
of the dev services were doing.

284
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:14,595
and also I would do some shameless
plugs for my, my own DevSecOps

285
00:15:14,655 --> 00:15:18,045
office hours and advertise, Hey,
I've got more training coming.

286
00:15:18,075 --> 00:15:21,255
If you've not gone, talk to your
manager and I'll get you in the class.

287
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:22,765
So I've said a lot there.

288
00:15:23,145 --> 00:15:25,385
And what were the
highlights of this program?

289
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:28,805
It's broken down by year one and year two.

290
00:15:29,305 --> 00:15:34,795
So for the first year, I did decrease the
application attack surface, by influencing

291
00:15:34,805 --> 00:15:37,275
the, revenue generating applications.

292
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:42,535
and the dev programs that support those
adhere to the SAS tooling, SAS tool

293
00:15:42,535 --> 00:15:44,405
compiler for the Build Breaker feature.

294
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:49,545
So the results were 100 percent
of the revenue generating

295
00:15:49,585 --> 00:15:53,915
applications were compliant by
that time in July in year one.

296
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,210
And then that was like the number one
and number two RGAs, over 90 percent

297
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,690
of those were compliant by November.

298
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:02,830
How did I do that?

299
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,840
I'll get to that in a second.

300
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,720
we also increased code quality,
helped deliver stable offerings to

301
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,590
our customers and the parent company.

302
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:15,960
And I used the SAST, the dashboard metrics
to, drive those two components above.

303
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,710
I'll get to that in the next slide.

304
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,250
But I talked about automation
and maturing processes.

305
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,090
we also baked and a person on my team
had a good idea to break the bake

306
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,570
and an automatic exception process
to be part of our ticketing system.

307
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,030
where the sign offs were all
done digitally by clicking a box.

308
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:37,070
and then they were able to get a
timed exception, you know, it wasn't

309
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,690
a get out of jail free card, but
if they had to get code out the

310
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,150
door, they would do this process.

311
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,730
And it also helped
myself and my team know.

312
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,790
Hey, do I have to increase my detective
preventive corrective controls?

313
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,710
Do I need to go talk to a different
IT group networking to get a

314
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,340
more aggressive firewall stance?

315
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,790
Do I need to up my, WAF rules?

316
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:01,420
Do I need to have a more aggressive, SEM
logic where the logs are being sent to?

317
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,320
So things of that nature.

318
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,200
and then if people were saying, well,
no, we can't do that, then I already

319
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,470
had the data points to say, well, if
we can't do that, then this code can't

320
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,810
be pushed and we can't push this out
to the, this feature out to the client.

321
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,380
Everyone is aware.

322
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,260
I had some money left over in the
budget, and I had a third party vendor,

323
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:22,460
validate my roadmap for the rest of the
two years, and they said it was good.

324
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,290
So, I talked about this
a little bit before.

325
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,360
This was a dashboard.

326
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,560
This was just done in Grafana.

327
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,590
what I like about it is, it's
easy, it's simple, it's clean.

328
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,500
If you're green, you're good.

329
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,460
Yellow, not so good, and red was bad.

330
00:17:35,985 --> 00:17:38,225
And you could click into
those dials and those other

331
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,695
components on the left and right.

332
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:43,105
And that would take, you to your
devs, your, your respective dev

333
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:48,455
stream to your dashboard of where
you're, why you're failing this.

334
00:17:48,465 --> 00:17:51,255
You're not meeting that
compiler breaker perspective.

335
00:17:51,795 --> 00:17:54,705
And what you could do is you could, click
on that and it will take you to the, it

336
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:57,285
will also take you to the tool and then
there was comments in there from the

337
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:01,905
tool from the, people that either fixed
similar problems that you're looking for.

338
00:18:01,945 --> 00:18:03,495
And you could look and
see how they did that.

339
00:18:03,865 --> 00:18:07,425
And if you couldn't figure out by looking
at inside the tool, how they fix that,

340
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:11,405
you had a, a person's name who fixed
that, that similar problem you may have,

341
00:18:11,415 --> 00:18:13,935
you could reach out to that person and
figure out, Hey, how'd you do this?

342
00:18:14,175 --> 00:18:16,165
So it worked out really well.

343
00:18:16,355 --> 00:18:20,155
there was also a, a big push
from upper management in terms

344
00:18:20,155 --> 00:18:21,915
of having metrics and dashboards.

345
00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:26,105
Of course, I had a countdown timer,
not a real one, but it's like, Hey,

346
00:18:26,135 --> 00:18:27,285
I'm gonna launch this dashboard.

347
00:18:27,285 --> 00:18:29,555
I'm going to give it to the
folks, you know, the higher ups,

348
00:18:30,215 --> 00:18:32,955
in 90 days, nothing, 60 days.

349
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,850
30, when I got about 30 days, people were
like, Oh, I better start efforting this.

350
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:42,600
And once I sat down with them and went
over just like, you know, If you fix this

351
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,670
one thing, it's going to take care of 80
percent of your issues, and it's going to

352
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,510
make your dial go from yellow to green.

353
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,310
Like, oh, okay, that was helpful.

354
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,790
Took it off their backlog, and then
they put it on the front burner there.

355
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,660
From a year two perspective, Things
improved from a process perspective

356
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,750
about, billbreaker compliance
for all the devstream programs.

357
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,480
They're operationalized, year two of Q1.

358
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,920
I added security evaluation
points into the CICD pipeline.

359
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:11,000
I use the term evaluation
points and not tollgates.

360
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,140
I don't like, I don't know anybody who
likes paying a toll just by default.

361
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,540
It has a negative connotation.

362
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,640
So I call it evaluation points.

363
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:25,400
I talk about that in the word marketing
and we did research a DASD solution.

364
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,310
We tested it out, as recommended
by our parent company.

365
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,760
But at the time, the way things
were going, it just wasn't the

366
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:38,960
right time to introduce that,
item into our DevSecOps, program.

367
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,530
It would have caused some friction and
the value that we would have gotten from

368
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,510
the tool would have not been proportioned
to what we needed at the time.

369
00:19:47,285 --> 00:19:50,375
So I rolled up and presented that
to the folks and they understood.

370
00:19:50,695 --> 00:19:54,475
I also have this, in the tool there's
this thing called Hotspot Champions

371
00:19:54,505 --> 00:19:59,455
and I empowered certain developers to
have these review and fix the findings.

372
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,700
They have like code smells
and, they can fix it.

373
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,780
Now, if they thought the way that was
looking at something wasn't correct,

374
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,890
they had the way to bypass that.

375
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,080
So it wasn't flag.

376
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,910
However, I would say there was
very few people and the system

377
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,470
that was the fast T system.

378
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,960
I had all the logs going to the sim.

379
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,860
So I knew when they would do that
and I tested it and I make sure the

380
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,920
rules fired as designed and I would
run monthly reports and give it back

381
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,250
to their leads or their managers.

382
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,060
So they just knew that.

383
00:20:27,535 --> 00:20:31,775
Not like it was trust, but verify, but
it was also showing like, Hey, your

384
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:33,465
team is using this, you're using it.

385
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:38,865
Well, it was also my way of like, I'm
watching you and no, you have to do that.

386
00:20:38,865 --> 00:20:39,135
Right.

387
00:20:39,635 --> 00:20:40,765
In close to the end here.

388
00:20:40,765 --> 00:20:42,625
So I'll go over the, success patterns.

389
00:20:42,635 --> 00:20:45,565
And I have this broken down into
two components, the technical

390
00:20:45,565 --> 00:20:47,595
and non non technical side.

391
00:20:48,005 --> 00:20:51,555
So from a non technical success
patterns, It was partnering,

392
00:20:51,565 --> 00:20:55,245
listening, partnering, asking lots
of questions, reoccurring meetings

393
00:20:55,245 --> 00:20:56,715
with all the engineering leadership.

394
00:20:57,185 --> 00:21:00,265
some monthly, some weekly,
depending on their schedule and

395
00:21:00,355 --> 00:21:02,225
how far they're up in the chain.

396
00:21:03,145 --> 00:21:06,865
shout this from the rooftops, secure
code is a form of code quality.

397
00:21:07,235 --> 00:21:12,745
And big, big, big focus on seamless
experience delivered to developers

398
00:21:12,765 --> 00:21:14,415
while they're adopting this new process.

399
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,365
The training and outreach
worked very well.

400
00:21:17,865 --> 00:21:21,180
You know, we talked about this,
the web app pen testing was okay.

401
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,710
The hack club meetings were great.

402
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,280
I'll mess means internal learning
management system was better

403
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,490
and the secure coding training.

404
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,230
I did the end was the best
approach, but if I went back in

405
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:34,050
time, I would just focus on these
2 pieces and I would still do that.

406
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:38,130
Hey, if you want to take the secure
coding train class, I have that's

407
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,320
not coming out anyone's budget.

408
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,470
Not even mine or the engineering's.

409
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,090
I got special money for it.

410
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,510
You know, do the IMS training.

411
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:48,595
OWASP training, attend the hack club
meetings, and then you can come take

412
00:21:48,595 --> 00:21:50,695
those two secure coding training classes.

413
00:21:51,195 --> 00:21:55,965
And I, I just used this as much as I
could and overused it all the time.

414
00:21:56,195 --> 00:21:59,045
You know, the form of code quality
is just secure coding, right?

415
00:21:59,215 --> 00:22:03,485
So, part two of this, non technical
pattern, the secret sauce, the matrix

416
00:22:03,485 --> 00:22:08,655
works, matrix working groups, the start
chamber, security champions, the dev

417
00:22:08,655 --> 00:22:11,935
sec ops office hours, word marketing.

418
00:22:12,085 --> 00:22:12,660
So, like, that's it.

419
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:18,180
Instead of using security toll gates,
I assessment points, evaluation points.

420
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,830
They have a lot less negative connotation,
but they're still doing the same thing.

421
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,370
Being the training dollars,
from finance for a special, that

422
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,780
the special project, I got it.

423
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,500
The injury management didn't
have to do anything, just

424
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,410
had allowed the people to go.

425
00:22:33,315 --> 00:22:35,025
I also worked with, most forgot this.

426
00:22:35,025 --> 00:22:40,485
I, I also worked with certain developers
and when I brought in training, I wanted

427
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:43,925
their two cents to, to make sure they
thought their voices were being heard.

428
00:22:43,925 --> 00:22:45,115
But also I had the final say, but.

429
00:22:45,845 --> 00:22:48,405
I wanted to make sure they
thought, hey, are we covering

430
00:22:48,405 --> 00:22:51,525
the frameworks, the languages we
need, are we missing anything?

431
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:52,705
Get that sentiment.

432
00:22:53,595 --> 00:22:56,325
And speaking of sentiment, I did
do some measuring of sentiment.

433
00:22:56,415 --> 00:22:58,575
how the program was perceived
and how it was going.

434
00:22:58,575 --> 00:23:01,595
Not just from those SAS, like
that dial matrix with the Grafana

435
00:23:01,595 --> 00:23:03,565
dashboard, but also just in general.

436
00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:07,965
sentiment, sentiment measuring is a big,
big thing to do when you're measuring.

437
00:23:08,405 --> 00:23:08,995
If you.

438
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,850
If the, if the perceived value of what
your program is doing, not just from a

439
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:17,600
technical perspective, but also from a
non technical perspective, and obviously,

440
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:21,220
if you get those two working in concert,
it's easier to keep that process going

441
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,730
and secure funding for other things.

442
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,150
You need to keep it,
going forward at the time.

443
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,180
I was the director of security.

444
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:30,120
So I'll give you these, from a
leadership pro tip perspective.

445
00:23:30,905 --> 00:23:35,935
We had internal mechanisms to recognize
people that did a very good job.

446
00:23:35,945 --> 00:23:41,145
And I always took this to recognize
developers that were positive about

447
00:23:41,635 --> 00:23:43,535
jumping on the DevSecOps train.

448
00:23:43,915 --> 00:23:48,475
That were truly genuine about looking
for vulnerabilities that were more

449
00:23:48,475 --> 00:23:52,695
security related and mentoring other
people and learning how to fix those.

450
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:58,360
also when I would write the write up
there for that, I would enrich enrich

451
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:03,130
the recognition early, nominations
infusing the company values and mission

452
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:09,060
statements where I worked for the C suite
is very big on that, which I agree with.

453
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,720
but if you infuse it with that, it paints.

454
00:24:12,165 --> 00:24:13,645
It has to be genuine, right?

455
00:24:13,655 --> 00:24:18,945
Like you can't just fake it, but
you genuinely recognize a developer

456
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:24,005
that is doing well as helping your
security team either, directly or

457
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:27,915
indirectly, and then you enrich it
with the value statements and the

458
00:24:27,915 --> 00:24:29,385
mission statement from your company.

459
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,585
one, the c that's gonna resonate better.

460
00:24:32,645 --> 00:24:35,555
It's actually gonna resonate
a lot louder with the C-suite.

461
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:39,675
And two, it's gonna show you as a
leader that you're, you're listening

462
00:24:39,705 --> 00:24:44,185
and you're infusing those value and
mission statements in there as well.

463
00:24:44,665 --> 00:24:46,465
And so it put, it puts
you in a good light.

464
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:49,855
You're nominating, you know, you're
recognizing developer using the company

465
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:54,295
values, mission statements, and so
you're getting a good, Synergy, if you

466
00:24:54,295 --> 00:24:58,155
use that word, but synergy between,
you know, leadership, upper leadership

467
00:24:58,175 --> 00:25:01,755
and individual contributor and middle
management down, you know, to the

468
00:25:01,755 --> 00:25:06,055
developer level, I know places I've
worked, you do your end of the year

469
00:25:06,055 --> 00:25:10,435
review, and then you would meet into a
room and do some calibration, you know, I,

470
00:25:10,435 --> 00:25:14,815
I sat in and all, the whole organization's
calibration sessions with an I.

471
00:25:14,825 --> 00:25:15,015
T.

472
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:18,230
Not just, you know, My team and
general IT, but also developers,

473
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,660
you know, we're talking about
people that, Hey, they did okay.

474
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,410
They did great.

475
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,780
They did really good.

476
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,720
you know, one of the things I, I, said
when we first started on the education

477
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,110
journey of this, I don't know anybody that
ever got a meat sum or a failing grade

478
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,900
in terms of their end of the year review
by saying, you know what, I fixed a bunch

479
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,230
of insecure code before it was pushed.

480
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:44,150
like, yeah, that's definitely worth,
me, some, I mean, it's not right.

481
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:46,350
So I also framed it like that.

482
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:49,690
I highlight the things I
think are important here.

483
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,290
Moving on to the technical patterns.

484
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,670
the static code analysis solution we
pivoted to and went to, the very low

485
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,970
cost point to get into and a very
low entry point for the integration

486
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,450
pieces adoption into the pipelines.

487
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,170
That was good.

488
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:09,580
it was purchased by my group, the security
team, which people liked because they

489
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,170
didn't have to worry about the licenses
and it didn't affect their budget.

490
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,280
There's a theme there.

491
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,910
But the agreement was that I would
buy it, but the platform team,

492
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,760
which is part of ITOps, would
run and administrate the tool.

493
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:24,070
Which is good, because I wanted my
team to deal with looking to do more

494
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,040
security related work, not adminning.

495
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:30,640
Again, Metrix, that DevSecOps program,
we measured it with the, near real

496
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,670
time dashboard, and just the ease,
ability of clicking through that and

497
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,910
getting to the tool, and finding out
where you needed to fix your item.

498
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:43,240
And that led to that self, Self feedback
from an application perspective and

499
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,730
getting those things remediated quicker.

500
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:48,120
And a big focus again on that
seamless experience delivered.

501
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:53,740
example, leveraging our existing ITSM
asset management application system.

502
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:57,250
The automated and timed exceptions.

503
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,410
And quick, and giving feedback
quickly to the dev, or through

504
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,120
the DevSecOps office hours.

505
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,510
And the Teams channel and piggybacking
off dev services office hours.

506
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,280
I also like to say.

507
00:27:10,115 --> 00:27:13,715
There's an exception, get
agile free card and everyone's

508
00:27:13,735 --> 00:27:15,285
risk tolerance is different.

509
00:27:15,405 --> 00:27:17,195
So just be mindful of that.

510
00:27:17,195 --> 00:27:20,925
But if it's typically within parameters
and you know, if you did for like a week

511
00:27:20,925 --> 00:27:24,985
and you have some compensating controls
that mitigate the risk, you know, it's

512
00:27:24,985 --> 00:27:26,655
good to get that done as soon as you can.

513
00:27:26,655 --> 00:27:30,625
But you can also run reports within
the system to see, hey, how many

514
00:27:30,935 --> 00:27:33,535
people or what groups are requesting.

515
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:35,625
The most exceptions, why?

516
00:27:35,635 --> 00:27:36,245
Is it a group?

517
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:36,865
Is it a term?

518
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:39,235
You can run metrics on that to
your reporting, like is it a

519
00:27:39,235 --> 00:27:40,855
certain framework, language, etc.

520
00:27:41,355 --> 00:27:44,255
So next steps, SBOM and DevSecOps.

521
00:27:45,095 --> 00:27:46,395
So SBOM, what is it?

522
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:50,755
Now this has been out for a while, but
stands for Software Build Materials.

523
00:27:50,785 --> 00:27:55,425
And essentially it's a list of, I call it
ingredients, components, libraries, and

524
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:57,955
modules that are used in a software build.

525
00:27:58,455 --> 00:28:01,455
it was first started by, one of
the first, our first people to

526
00:28:01,455 --> 00:28:03,575
use it was SPDX and CycloneDX.

527
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:09,080
And they have different attributes and
things that they, categorize that part on.

528
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,510
you know, the goal would be automated,
you know, put that into your

529
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,160
pipeline, some process that you're
able to break down the components

530
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,010
and get a better visibility into.

531
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:22,080
So this is driving by an executive
order that came out in 2021.

532
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,320
You should know that.

533
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:30,190
And it's looking to, beef up and bolster
the secure software supply chain and also

534
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,970
deal with upstream customer expectations.

535
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:36,670
Now with SBOM, you can, in theory,
prevent issues before, it become

536
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:39,260
a really big, problem you have
to deal with down the road.

537
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,390
You can detect vulnerabilities earlier
and often and provide some transparency.

538
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,920
It gives that insights
to the engineering team.

539
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,150
Like I said before, you can run some
reports if you're capturing that data.

540
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,070
Is it, are teams putting
in more exceptions?

541
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:57,575
Because they use a certain framework
or is it a library they're using?

542
00:28:57,585 --> 00:29:00,625
Now you can get down to the nitty
gritty and some components there, right?

543
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:02,425
So how can this work in reality?

544
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:07,100
Now I use these, these two CVs are
a bit old, but they still work.

545
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,560
And it's just a good example.

546
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,040
These came out in October,
I believe in 2023.

547
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:16,250
and they deal with a lib
curl, and, piece there.

548
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:20,150
And then, you know, like, well, I have
to find all this, all this, all these

549
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:23,110
libraries and where are these, where
are these located in my environment?

550
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,460
So it's kind of like, where's Wado?

551
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,310
Like he used to play, where's Wado?

552
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,390
You'd find Wado, right?

553
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,710
But in this case, you got to find his hat.

554
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:28,760
Okay.

555
00:29:29,325 --> 00:29:32,475
finds classes, you got
to find Waldo himself.

556
00:29:32,925 --> 00:29:34,515
So you'd be able to trace all that back.

557
00:29:35,115 --> 00:29:39,595
it's kind of like the cheat code
for S bomb and closing things out.

558
00:29:39,595 --> 00:29:41,315
Here are the seven key takeaways.

559
00:29:41,815 --> 00:29:45,390
We'll identify remove adoption
barriers like I did with the Making

560
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,050
it a part of goals and objectives.

561
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,960
Removing the budget barrier.

562
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:50,820
very collaborative centric.

563
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,710
Word marketing, I can't
stress that enough.

564
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:57,890
As long as the intent of your process
or tool is doing the same thing, I

565
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,360
would just soften the name of that.

566
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,670
Don't use a toll gate,
use a valuation point.

567
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,950
the training and outreach, it shows
that you're trying to help them, you're

568
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,880
giving them the right content, you're
involving them in the decision making

569
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,375
process in terms of what you're Training
to use and what vendors, but in the

570
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:15,525
day you make sure you have the ultimate
control over that and you're delivering

571
00:30:15,525 --> 00:30:17,125
the right content with their help.

572
00:30:18,115 --> 00:30:20,715
don't be afraid to advertise
your program value.

573
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:23,125
I would, I would tell it to my manager.

574
00:30:23,285 --> 00:30:27,375
If I would run into, one of my C
suite, I would tell him if he heard

575
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:28,695
anything about it and how it's going.

576
00:30:29,345 --> 00:30:30,785
and I also use that dashboard.

577
00:30:30,835 --> 00:30:34,025
obviously we had some quarterly updates
as well that we used to do, but.

578
00:30:34,735 --> 00:30:38,605
But beyond that, I think it's always
good to keep that going, you know,

579
00:30:38,775 --> 00:30:44,155
keep it in the foreground, always keep
advertising your positives of a new

580
00:30:44,155 --> 00:30:48,975
initiative, brag about it, and then,
you know, process improvement beyond

581
00:30:48,975 --> 00:30:53,025
what good looks like we talked about
at the beginning of my talk and, you

582
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:55,415
know, I like this number seven a lot.

583
00:30:55,415 --> 00:30:58,845
I don't think it gets enough love,
but document and action your future.

584
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:02,000
you know, I talked about automation at
the beginning, you know, sometimes you

585
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,160
didn't have the time, you didn't have
the resource or the talent or the special

586
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,390
skills to do some automation people list.

587
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,280
I know it sounds corny, but
that's why I used to do.

588
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,790
I used to get what thing was called
favorability, which was like some

589
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,720
extra money at the end of fiscal year.

590
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,340
they knew that I always had a
list going in terms of like, Hey,

591
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,350
Josh always ready to spend money.

592
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,440
He hasn't always teed up, you know,
if it was OpEx or CapEx, I could spend

593
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,285
it on, you know, Consultants, or I can
maybe buy a tool or extend some license

594
00:31:28,285 --> 00:31:33,455
I needed, so, but anything I could do to
automate, that was always one more thing,

595
00:31:33,495 --> 00:31:36,705
because one, it was one of our goals, but
obviously it's just a good thing to do,

596
00:31:36,705 --> 00:31:40,685
but if I was able to automate some stuff
with my team's help or anybody else, that

597
00:31:40,685 --> 00:31:45,105
was another thing I just threw out there,
or advertised in, the positive aspects of

598
00:31:45,105 --> 00:31:48,515
the program getting more mature, and these
are the ones I think are really important.

599
00:31:49,015 --> 00:31:50,705
So that concludes my talk.

600
00:31:50,715 --> 00:31:50,775
Thank you.

601
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:53,825
I hope you enjoyed it, and if
you'd like to reach out to me,

602
00:31:53,825 --> 00:31:54,965
you can, find me on LinkedIn.

603
00:31:55,195 --> 00:31:55,975
It's my contact.

604
00:31:55,975 --> 00:31:56,775
Thank you very much.
