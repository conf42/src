00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:12,450
I help 70 needs of experience in
enterprise integration architecture.

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:20,270
Today I'm going to talk about
driving digital transformation using

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:27,620
Oracle Tech for e governance and
digital inclusion in rural areas.

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:35,170
In today's increasingly digital
world, rural communities often find

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,310
themselves left behind, disconnected
from essential services that

7
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,385
are residents take for granted.

8
00:00:45,885 --> 00:00:51,474
This digital divide not only
limits access to information.

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:58,269
But depends existing social
economic in inequalities.

10
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:06,870
Our research explores how Oracle's
technological solutions are transforming e

11
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:15,890
governance and fostering digital inclusion
in underserved regions by leveraging.

00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:47,230
3.7 billion disconnected people
globally without internet access.

17
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:54,280
65% rural gap of disconnected
people living in rural areas.

18
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:00,780
40% economic impact, income
disparity between connected

19
00:02:00,785 --> 00:02:02,310
and disconnected communities.

20
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,990
The whole digital divide represents.

21
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,630
One of the most persistent forms
of inequality in modern society,

22
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:17,880
limited connectivity infrastructure,
high deployment cost under lower

23
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:24,360
population density, create significant
barriers to digital inclusion.

24
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:32,840
This technological isolation translates
directly into reduced access to education.

25
00:02:33,334 --> 00:02:38,785
Healthcare, financial services
and government resources for

26
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:45,084
rural residents, this means fewer
opportunities for economic advancement

27
00:02:45,714 --> 00:02:52,765
and diminished participation in
increasingly digital civic processes.

28
00:02:53,265 --> 00:02:55,934

Telemedicine integration, so would
connect remote clinics with urban medical

45
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:37,505
centers allowing virtual consultations
and specialist referrals that could

46
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:39,740
otherwise require lengthy travel.

47
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,469
Healthcare antics.

48
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:48,490
Data driven insights help identify disease
patterns, optimize resource allocation,

49
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,130
and improve to care initiatives
targeted to specific community needs.

50
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:59,570
Healthcare transformation represents
one of the most impactful application

51

00:10:51,124 --> 00:10:57,449
We track key indicators over a. 24
month period to assess not just initial

114
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:03,569
implementation success, but sustained
adoption and evolving usage patterns

115
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,979
as communities integrated digital
services into daily life compared

116
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:16,579
to analysis by comparing diverse
implementation approaches across.

117
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:19,549
Different regional contests.

118
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:25,699
We identified universal success
factors as well as contest

119
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:31,909
specific adoptations that enhanced
effectiveness in particular settings.

120
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:38,569
This rigorous evaluation methodology
allowed us to move beyond and

121
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:42,859
doctoral success stories to develop
evidence-based recommendations

122
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:45,109
for future implementations.

123
00:11:45,609 --> 00:11:52,209
Notably our findings challenge
several common exemptions about rural

124
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:57,219

126
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:09,644
Over 50% of rural population experience
improved access to digital services

127
00:12:09,974 --> 00:12:17,084
with particularly strong gains among
previously marginalized groups.

128
00:12:17,714 --> 00:12:23,079
Service efficiency, administrative
processing times decreased by an

129
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:28,874
average of 65% across all measured
services, with some process

130
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:31,079
showing even greater improvements.

131
00:12:31,579 --> 00:12:38,609
Governance quality transparency ratings
increased by 40% point while reported.

132
00:12:38,609 --> 00:12:44,579
Corruption incidents declined by
over 30% in distilled service areas.

133
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:51,659
Economic benefits, communities with
freely implemented digital services showed

134
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:57,689
average economic growth 1.2 percentage
points higher than comparable non areas.

135
00:12:58,189 --> 00:13:03,024

00:13:09,744 --> 00:13:13,044
relationships, and economic opportunity.

138
00:13:13,764 --> 00:13:21,144
These changes help particular significance
for historically underserved populations,

139
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:24,709
including women and minority groups.

140
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:28,509
Feature directions and
policy recommendations.

141
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,709
Invest in rural digital infrastructure.

142
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:38,819
Government should prioritize extending
high speed connectivity to rural areas

143
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:45,569
through public private partnerships and
innovate to large mile solutions like

144
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:48,989
community networks and satellite internet.

145
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:52,589
Develop integrated technology platforms.

146
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:57,919

Integrated stack delivers greater
value than siloed applications,

148
00:14:03,564 --> 00:14:07,804
enabling cost, sector synergies and
resource sharing, expand distilled

149
00:14:07,804 --> 00:14:10,804
data literacy programs, digital skills.

150
00:14:11,614 --> 00:14:15,904
Training should be integrated
into formal and informal education

151
00:14:15,904 --> 00:14:21,004
systems with a special attention
to reaching adult learners and

152
00:14:21,154 --> 00:14:26,364
designing culturally relevant,
continue evidence-based evaluation.

153
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:31,044
Ongoing research should focus
on quantifying long-term

154
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:33,204
social and economic impacts.

155
00:14:33,219 --> 00:14:39,009
To guide future investments and
identify emerging best practices.

156
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:45,759
The future of rural digital inclusion
depends on coordinated action across

157
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,149
policy domains and stakeholder groups.

158
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:56,019
Our research suggested that technology
alone cannot breach the DI digital divide.

159
00:14:56,619 --> 00:15:01,059
Success requires simultaneous
attention to infrastructure.

160
00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:05,199
Skills, content and governance frameworks.

161
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:10,659
With the thoughtful implementation
of the recommendations Mo that

162
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:17,229
transform me to potential of Oracle
technologies can be fully realized

163
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:22,929
creating more equitable and efficient
role governance systems worldwide.

164
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:24,599
I hope you all
