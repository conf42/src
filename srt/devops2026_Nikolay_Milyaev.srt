1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,300
Speaker 25: Oh, my name is Ika.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,790
I'm a senior consultant at Microsoft.

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:09,140
Today, I will walk through practical
ways to reduce alert storms and

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,620
improve meantime to respond in
your security operation center.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,350
The presentation slides and information I
share today present my own personal view.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,645
I'm speaking for myself and not on behalf
of my employee, Microsoft Corporation.

7
00:00:22,145 --> 00:00:24,245
Today is about speed and sanity.

8
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:29,115
We all know the feeling of the SOC
or other on-call engineers get built

9
00:00:29,115 --> 00:00:33,275
in alerts and the truly important
signal arrives disgusted as noise.

10
00:00:33,775 --> 00:00:37,855
This deck is a particular pipeline
that turns through alerts into fast,

11
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:41,935
consistent resolution using only
Microsoft Native building blocks.

12
00:00:42,595 --> 00:00:46,555
We'll walk through four stage
first correlation group related

13
00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:50,735
alerts into a single incident to
responders walk coherent case.

14
00:00:51,305 --> 00:00:55,445
Second first mile automation the
safe, repeatable steps you should do.

15
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:59,675
The moment an incident is created
like enrichment and the routing.

16
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:05,299
Third AI systems are using security
pilot to summarize answer questions

17
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,100
and generate recommended actions.

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,199
So analysis time collapses.

19
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:14,479
Fourth measurement, an executive
score cut that shows MTTR Time set

20
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,350
by automation and trend lines that
per roof improvements over time.

21
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:23,419
So by then you should have a blueprint
you can implement incrementally.

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,195
Start small to measure, then expand.

23
00:01:26,695 --> 00:01:27,774
So here is the path.

24
00:01:27,995 --> 00:01:29,345
We start with the why.

25
00:01:29,405 --> 00:01:31,655
Alert storms are not just annoying.

26
00:01:31,705 --> 00:01:36,384
They directly inflate MTTR
because humans spend time charging

27
00:01:36,414 --> 00:01:38,335
noise instead of a soft impact.

28
00:01:39,145 --> 00:01:42,744
Then we go through the pipeline
as a simple mental model.

29
00:01:42,865 --> 00:01:47,634
So correlate alerts into incidents,
automate the safe first steps, use AI to

30
00:01:47,634 --> 00:01:49,675
accelerate analysis and measure outcomes.

31
00:01:50,175 --> 00:01:55,055
Next, we'll zoom in on correlation
across three surfaces sentinel

32
00:01:55,055 --> 00:01:56,615
correlation and fusion.

33
00:01:56,615 --> 00:02:01,175
Four multi-stage attacks, the
founder XDR incident, correlation,

34
00:02:01,175 --> 00:02:05,465
and merging across endpoint identity
email and cloud app signals.

35
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:09,545
And for us, RE Azure Monitor
Smart Groups that cluster related

36
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:11,225
alerts to reduce paging noise.

37
00:02:11,855 --> 00:02:16,115
After that, we look at first mile
automation, where logic apps, playbook,

38
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:18,275
scandal, enrichment, dedupe, and routing.

39
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:24,905
So we'll then add security pilot as
an analysis accelerator, so summaries,

40
00:02:24,905 --> 00:02:29,795
guided responses and natural language
that trans questions into KQL and hunting.

41
00:02:30,295 --> 00:02:34,105
Finally, we'll end with measurement
and the real scenario walk through,

42
00:02:34,105 --> 00:02:36,030
plus a pragmatic error out plan.

43
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,475
So this goes not become an error
ending transformation project.

44
00:02:39,565 --> 00:02:39,805
Yeah.

45
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:42,485
Okay, let us define the enemy.

46
00:02:42,645 --> 00:02:44,895
Alert storms are not a lack of tooling.

47
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:47,325
They are a lack of attention bandwidth.

48
00:02:47,545 --> 00:02:51,115
A useful mental model is that
humans can do deep thinking on

49
00:02:51,115 --> 00:02:52,670
a handful of cases at a time.

50
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,550
But most environments generate
thousands of alerts daily, thousands.

51
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:04,110
One commonly cited survey number is
an average on 3,832 alerts per day and

52
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,950
throughly, 62% of alerts going unattended.

53
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,245
Unattended alerts 62%.

54
00:03:10,745 --> 00:03:13,415
When that happens, the system
becomes self-reinforcing.

55
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:18,605
Responses get burned, they start ignoring,
and the organization gets slower.

56
00:03:19,445 --> 00:03:21,695
For us, E, the pattern is the same.

57
00:03:21,795 --> 00:03:26,415
One root cause triggers dozens of symptoms
across metrics and monitors, and you

58
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:29,130
get paged for each symptom for security.

59
00:03:29,265 --> 00:03:33,645
Different stage of Antech across
email identity and endpoint, but if

60
00:03:33,645 --> 00:03:38,325
those are not stitched together, you
lose the narrative and you lose time.

61
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,660
MTTR is basically the sum of
detection, triage, analysis,

62
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,550
coordination, and remediation.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,350
If the first three are noisy and manual,
everything downstream is delayed,

64
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:55,180
so our goal is to collapse the time
to understand with correlation Safe

65
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,750
Commission and AI assisted analysis,
and to prove E two is merchant.

66
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,260
This is the whole story in one slide.

67
00:04:01,394 --> 00:04:05,354
I hopes for our purposes is simply
operations work that are assisted by

68
00:04:05,354 --> 00:04:07,185
machine intelligence and automation.

69
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:11,174
With humans still accountable
for decisions, humans already

70
00:04:11,265 --> 00:04:12,524
accountable for decisions.

71
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,745
Step one is correlation.

72
00:04:14,774 --> 00:04:19,065
If you do not nurture related signals,
every downstream step was forth.

73
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:24,224
The goal is one incident with a shared
set of entities and a coherent timeline.

74
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:27,335
Step two is first mile automation.

75
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:32,145
Think of it as the checklist you wish ran
itself the moment an incident arrives.

76
00:04:32,175 --> 00:04:33,045
Pull threat intel.

77
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:34,125
Four indicators.

78
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:38,685
Attach user and device contact
tag and route to the right team.

79
00:04:38,715 --> 00:04:42,435
Open the ticket post to teams
and suppress obvious duplicates.

80
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,520
Step three is AI assistance.

81
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,570
Security cap pilot is useful
because it compresses analysis and

82
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,190
communication summaries, guided
response later, or language questions,

83
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,440
and become queries and draft reports.

84
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,780
The key is that it provides
advice, not anonymous action.

85
00:05:01,395 --> 00:05:03,375
Step four is just measurement.

86
00:05:03,915 --> 00:05:08,145
If you cannot show MTTR improvements
and time saved, the program will stall.

87
00:05:08,265 --> 00:05:12,495
The scorecard is also a feedback
loop to tune rules and playbooks.

88
00:05:12,995 --> 00:05:16,385
Correlation is the first level
because it detects the root cause

89
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:18,785
of alert storms fragmentation.

90
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:24,065
If the system presents 40 separate
alerts that are rarely one event, your

91
00:05:24,065 --> 00:05:29,435
team does 40 micro investigations,
creates 40 tickets, and repeats

92
00:05:29,435 --> 00:05:31,655
the same context given 40 times.

93
00:05:32,155 --> 00:05:33,205
That is pure West.

94
00:05:33,895 --> 00:05:37,165
When we correlate, we
trade volume for fidelity.

95
00:05:37,675 --> 00:05:42,415
The object people work becomes
an incident, an actionable group

96
00:05:42,415 --> 00:05:46,135
of related alerts with a shared
set of entities and a timeline.

97
00:05:46,945 --> 00:05:50,665
That is why correlation tends to
improve both analyst experience and

98
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:52,945
response speed on the Microsoft stack.

99
00:05:52,945 --> 00:05:56,305
Correlation happens in a few places
depending on the signal type.

100
00:05:56,755 --> 00:06:02,005
Sentinel can correlate across many sources
and has fusion for multi-stage scenarios.

101
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:06,925
Defender XDR correlates across the
Microsoft 3 6 5 security domains and

102
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:12,715
can merge incidents into a broader
campaign for SRE Azure Monitor Smart

103
00:06:12,715 --> 00:06:17,125
Groups cluster related alert, so the
on call engineer gets one page of a

104
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,985
situation, not a page per symptom.

105
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:20,305
That's good.

106
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,205
Once relation, once correlation is
in place downstream, automation is

107
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:29,905
safer because you are acting on high
confidence data that already has context.

108
00:06:30,405 --> 00:06:32,954
Sentinel is the correlation workforce.

109
00:06:32,954 --> 00:06:38,864
When you need a CM view across many
sources, the headline feature is fusion,

110
00:06:39,074 --> 00:06:43,664
a correlation engine that use scalable
machine learning to detect multi-stage

111
00:06:43,664 --> 00:06:47,504
attacks by finding combinations
of behavior across the tech chain.

112
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:51,224
Then you rate a single incident
that contains multiple alerts.

113
00:06:51,724 --> 00:06:55,474
But do not overlook the simple
level incident grouping at

114
00:06:55,474 --> 00:06:57,215
the analytics rule level.

115
00:06:57,514 --> 00:07:02,374
If a rule is noisy, you can often fix
the experience by grouping adults into a

116
00:07:02,374 --> 00:07:04,984
single incident by entity and time window.

117
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:09,684
A hundred failed Logons can become one
incident with a clear story rather than

118
00:07:09,714 --> 00:07:12,324
a hundred tickets and melted analyst.

119
00:07:12,564 --> 00:07:12,894
Yeah.

120
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,680
Hundred tickets for
just for the same logs.

121
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,400
It's crazy.

122
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,680
The result is that incident.

123
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,430
You open press, reach, context
entities related alerts, and

124
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,630
the beginning of a timeline.

125
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,750
So that makes the next
step Automation reliable.

126
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,080
The playbook can run, enrichment
taking and notification the

127
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,520
moment incident is created.

128
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,520
One more nuance.

129
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:37,229
Sentinel is moving toward the
defender portal for Unified SecOps.

130
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:41,529
That doesn't change the architecture,
but it improves the single pane of glass.

131
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:44,559
Experience one console
on the tools inside.

132
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:45,819
It's very useful.

133
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,439
Defender XDR is powerful because
it correlates across the Microsoft

134
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:55,749
3 6 5 security domains, endpoint
email identity, and cloud apps.

135
00:07:56,375 --> 00:08:01,294
Incident correlation engine decides
whatever a new alert should attach to

136
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:05,974
an existing incident, start a new one,
or even merchant incidents if it detects

137
00:08:05,974 --> 00:08:07,984
the part of the same broader campaign.

138
00:08:08,484 --> 00:08:12,744
This matters because multi-stage attacks
are early leave in one data source.

139
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:15,075
At Fish is email telemetry.

140
00:08:15,075 --> 00:08:18,374
Execution is endpoint telemetry
and privilege Escalation

141
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:20,744
shows up in identity signals.

142
00:08:21,374 --> 00:08:26,534
If this land has separate cases, you need
a human to connect them, and humans are

143
00:08:26,534 --> 00:08:28,509
slow at graph problems when under stress.

144
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,390
Especially on press, so don't be stressed.

145
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,579
The unified security operation story
becomes even stronger when Sentinel is

146
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:38,439
integrated with the Defender Portal.

147
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,669
You can see sentinel incidents and
data alongside defender incidents

148
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:46,870
in one queue that reduces tools
switching and accelerates ation.

149
00:08:47,814 --> 00:08:51,865
The key takeaway correlation is not
only about reducing volume, it's

150
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:56,635
about building a defensible narrative
that helps responders make faster

151
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:58,344
decisions with higher confidence.

152
00:08:58,844 --> 00:09:03,194
The security world does not own
alert storms, so SRA has the same

153
00:09:03,194 --> 00:09:05,175
beast, just we different clothes.

154
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:10,334
One reliability incident often produces
an explosion of symptoms, alerts.

155
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,660
CPU latency, error rates,
auto skates, gateway, health.

156
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:20,069
If you page, if your paging system
treats each symptom as a separate

157
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:23,069
emergency, you end up with a paging storm.

158
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:28,929
Azure monitor has AIOps features
that help starting with smart groups.

159
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:33,009
Smart groups use similarity and
co-occurrence patterns to cluster

160
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:35,019
related alerts into a single group.

161
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:38,469
So responders focus on the situation,
not the individual symptoms.

162
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:43,199
Azure Monitor also offers anomaly
detection and dynamic thresholds that

163
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:48,269
adapt to normal patterns, which reduces
false alerts and systems change.

164
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:54,389
The key point for the session, SecOps
and ARI can share a common pipeline.

165
00:09:55,349 --> 00:09:58,319
The telemetry differs, but
the workflow is the same.

166
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:02,729
Correlation to reduce NOS,
automation to enrich and road AI

167
00:10:02,729 --> 00:10:06,299
assistance, to accelerate analysis
and measurement to keep improving.

168
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:07,339
The same part.

169
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,489
Once incident exists, we can automate the
first mile, the immediate repeatable steps

170
00:10:12,489 --> 00:10:14,199
that should happen in the first minute.

171
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:17,519
The key phrase is save by design.

172
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:20,369
We want automations that build trust.

173
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:23,789
Note automation that goes
downtime or fail contained.

174
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:29,279
Reasonable first enrichment Attach
threat intel for indicators.

175
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,599
Pull users and device contact checks if
the same entity has appeared recently

176
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,669
and added context to an incident.

177
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,349
So responder starts ahead.

178
00:10:38,249 --> 00:10:39,479
Second duplication.

179
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,629
Even with good correlation,
you will still get.

180
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:46,519
The system should consistently
suppress obvious duplicates

181
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,679
grouped by entity and time window.

182
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:52,249
And if you out close duplicates,
keep the evidence trail so

183
00:10:52,249 --> 00:10:54,169
analyst can what happened?

184
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:58,839
Third, routing severity and
ownership should be automatic.

185
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,959
Where possible notify through teams or
paging open and ITSM Deacon and push there

186
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,909
and reach context so humans do not have
to retype or copy past, just copy past.

187
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:11,459
Ground race meta.

188
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,679
Start with read only enrichment.

189
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,659
Log every action, and for any
containment step, make it reversible

190
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:20,429
or require explicit proof.

191
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:22,829
Reversible is the key word here.

192
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:24,589
This is the punchline.

193
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:25,249
Architecture.

194
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:28,819
Automation and AI are
not competing approach.

195
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,349
They are complementary.

196
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:33,124
Automation is deterministic and fast.

197
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:35,899
Perfect for structured tasks.

198
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:40,129
Line enrichment AI is good at
summarization, master evidence,

199
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:41,719
and suggesting next steps.

200
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:45,499
A practical pardon is to
trigger a logic up playbook.

201
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:50,269
When a sentinel incident is created,
the playbook extracts the incident and

202
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:52,999
loops over and types like IP address.

203
00:11:53,054 --> 00:11:57,314
Accounts, hosts and
processes for each entity.

204
00:11:57,314 --> 00:12:01,604
It can run deterministic enrichment
like reputation lookup or pulling

205
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:03,764
data device compliance from intern.

206
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:09,184
Then it calls security copilot via the
logic app connector, sending a prompt

207
00:12:09,244 --> 00:12:13,894
that asks for incident overview and
entity analysis and mitigation steps.

208
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:18,139
Finally, it posts the results back
into the incident as a command.

209
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:23,359
Now the human sees a structure
summary immediately that shortens

210
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:27,439
the time to understand, which is
often their real bottlenecks and TR.

211
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:30,169
This should not be treated as magic.

212
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:35,079
You still review AI output and you
still design prompts and guard rails.

213
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:39,064
But as a workflow, it's enormously
effective because it front loads

214
00:12:39,064 --> 00:12:40,474
analysis and documentation.

215
00:12:40,974 --> 00:12:45,805
Security capital is most valuable when
it reduces two expensive activities,

216
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:48,175
analysis time and communication time.

217
00:12:48,895 --> 00:12:52,525
Instead of reading call logs and
alert metadata, you ask a question

218
00:12:52,525 --> 00:12:54,055
and get a structured answer.

219
00:12:54,175 --> 00:12:55,584
Ference I density in context.

220
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:58,305
In practice, you use it in two ways.

221
00:12:58,334 --> 00:13:03,164
First interactively during an
investigation, ask for a summary, ask what

222
00:13:03,164 --> 00:13:08,534
else to look at, ask for KQL to answer
hypothesis or ask for an executive report.

223
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:10,999
So you can just ask it in the.

224
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,459
Ordinary language.

225
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:15,909
Second, proactively call
copilot from a playbook.

226
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:20,169
So every new incident gets an initial
AI summary attached as a command.

227
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:20,889
Automatically.

228
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:24,939
Copilot can also help
with query generation.

229
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:28,839
If you do not remember the exact table
or field name, you can describe what

230
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:31,119
you want and let it draft the query.

231
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:32,889
Then you validate and run.

232
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:35,519
So you really do not need to
know KKO very well for it.

233
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:39,469
That's a huge speed boost for less
experienced responders, and it

234
00:13:39,469 --> 00:13:41,359
helps senior responders move faster.

235
00:13:41,859 --> 00:13:46,209
A key governance note compile provides
analysis and recommendations, but it does

236
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:50,919
not autonomously change your environment,
your playbooks, and your human decide

237
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:52,779
actions, which keeps the pipeline safe.

238
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,479
If you want the leadership support
you need proof, not anecdotes.

239
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:58,909
Yeah, it doesn't help.

240
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:05,179
The most important metric is MTTR,
key Metric, but it's more useful when

241
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:11,329
sliced by severity, by category, and
by where that automation was involved.

242
00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:17,059
Microsoft Sentinel has strong analyst
views, but executive dashboards often

243
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:19,639
require custom workbooks or exported data.

244
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:24,699
A common approach is to pull incident
identifi the sentinel rest API, stored

245
00:14:24,789 --> 00:14:29,739
in a custom log analytics table, and
then build a workbook that calculates

246
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:34,239
KPIs like average resolution time
incidents by severity, closure

247
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,099
reasons, and automation time saved.

248
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:39,689
Do not obsess All perfect
measurement on day one.

249
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:44,099
Start with a few metrics that are easy
to compute and hard to argue with.

250
00:14:44,969 --> 00:14:46,289
M-T-T-A-M-T-T-R incident.

251
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:48,869
Count by severity and
time saved by automation.

252
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:53,264
Then add depth, false positive
rates, categories, and trends

253
00:14:53,314 --> 00:14:55,104
after specific journey change.

254
00:14:55,484 --> 00:14:57,929
So move by the very small steps in this.

255
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:01,789
Most importantly, read the
scorecard as a control loop.

256
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:06,199
If a certain incident type keeps
taking hours, that is hint that

257
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:10,669
your enrichment is missing context
of your own books and incomplete.

258
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:13,429
The dashboard tells you where to invest.

259
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:13,879
Next,

260
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:17,559
let us put it all together
with a realistic scenario.

261
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:23,739
A user receives sufficient email defender
for office detects that fish soon after

262
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:27,384
defender for endpoint detects suspicious
process on the same user's device.

263
00:15:27,884 --> 00:15:32,894
In parallel identity protection facts,
animals, behavioral for the same account.

264
00:15:33,074 --> 00:15:37,694
So we know that device was
affected without correlation.

265
00:15:37,694 --> 00:15:41,774
This becomes three separate cases,
across three tools, and potentially

266
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:46,064
three teams with Defender XDR,
correlation and Sentinel ingestion.

267
00:15:46,064 --> 00:15:49,034
The system recognized the shared
entities and likely attack

268
00:15:49,034 --> 00:15:51,134
sequence and produced one incident.

269
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:52,994
One, no three.

270
00:15:53,444 --> 00:15:54,554
That is the first win.

271
00:15:55,244 --> 00:15:58,064
The second win is first mile automation.

272
00:15:58,274 --> 00:16:02,534
As soon as the incident exists,
playbooks run, they pull thread

273
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:04,784
into of the URL hash or IP address.

274
00:16:05,324 --> 00:16:07,784
They attach user and device context.

275
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,394
They wrote the right team and notify.

276
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:15,254
Depending on your policy, they can
take a reversible containment step,

277
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:18,789
like isolating the endpoint or forcing
a password to set, for example.

278
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:20,939
The third win is copilot.

279
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:23,699
A prompt book generates
a structured summary.

280
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,689
What happened?

281
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:27,570
Effective entities and
recommended next actions.

282
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,549
That summary is attached to the incidents.

283
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:31,140
So the human starts with narrator.

284
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:34,289
That combination collapse the
first 15 minutes, which is

285
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:36,090
often where MTTR is decided.

286
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:40,215
AIOps programs fail when
they try to boil the ocean.

287
00:16:40,315 --> 00:16:43,615
The trick is sequencing, start
with baseline and hydrogen.

288
00:16:44,115 --> 00:16:49,995
Measure your current MTT and
MTTR identity, your top no

289
00:16:50,205 --> 00:16:54,435
detections, and apply grouping and
tuning so humans are not drawn.

290
00:16:55,425 --> 00:16:57,225
Then introduce safe automation.

291
00:16:57,405 --> 00:17:01,905
Begin with read only enrichment playbooks
because they cannot break production

292
00:17:01,905 --> 00:17:03,915
and they immediate safe analyst time.

293
00:17:04,415 --> 00:17:08,195
And routing and ticket creation
document rollback steps for

294
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,845
any action that change state.

295
00:17:10,835 --> 00:17:13,685
Next layer in copilot acceleration.

296
00:17:13,895 --> 00:17:18,005
So standardize a few Pro
books like executive summary

297
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:19,355
and investigation summary.

298
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:23,165
Attach outputs to incidents
of the knowledge is preserved.

299
00:17:23,975 --> 00:17:28,400
Trained analyst to validate our
output rather than blindly trusted.

300
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,090
Finally run an optimization loop.

301
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,860
Review the scorecard, pick the incident
categories with highest MTTR and bill

302
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,810
playbooks and run books for those.

303
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:42,400
Expand the same approach to other
e alerts and on call patterns.

304
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,000
Governance is essential.

305
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:48,650
Use list privilege entities, versions,
and review playbooks like code and

306
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:53,090
define explicit criteria for when
automation can perform containment and

307
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,010
when it must require human approval.

308
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,850
Let us close with a
simple set of takeaways.

309
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,370
First, correlation is the front door.

310
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,900
If you are still dealing with alert
by alert work, everything else is an

311
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,470
efficiency page over a structural problem.

312
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,700
Second, first mile automation is
where you get immediate MT TR.

313
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,690
Improvement, remission, enrichment,
routing, the duplication,

314
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,070
and safe containment steps.

315
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,860
Remove the early minutes of manual.

316
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,950
Third security compiled is best used
to compress analysis and reporting.

317
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:29,660
It turns messy evidence into
narrative and suggest next actions.

318
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:35,120
When you attach those outputs back to
the incident, the whole team benefits and

319
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,070
you build a knowledge based over time.

320
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,310
Fourth measurement is the
difference between a cool

321
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,200
demo and an operating model.

322
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,440
The scorecard makes the
improvements visible and tells

323
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,910
you where to invest next.

324
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,750
Finally, the safest way to
implement this is incremental.

325
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,020
Start with one high
pain incident category.

326
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,940
Apply correlation and grouping.

327
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:01,790
Add one enrichment playbook, add compiled
summary, measure MTTR before and after.

328
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,220
When that works, just repeat.

329
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:09,200
This is how you go from alert storms
to fast count consistent resolution.

330
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,660
Thank you very much.

331
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,350
Ask me questions on my page.

332
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,840
I was glad to see you.

333
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:15,920
It.
