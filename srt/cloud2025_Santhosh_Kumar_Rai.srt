00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:00,960
Hello there.

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:02,930
This is Santosh Kumar Rai.

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,980
Welcome to Conf42 Cloud Native 2025.

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,260
Today's topic is revolutionizing
health care with data engineering.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,939
The integration of data engineering
is transforming personalized medicine.

6
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:22,130
Data engineers ensure the
collection, integration, and

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,619
analysis of vast data sets.

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,530
Glencians can make real time,
evidence based decisions

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,820
using data driven approaches.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,870
So there are four main components of
the data engineering roles, collection,

11
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,920
integration, processing, and analysis.

12
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:42,820
The collection enables the automated
gathering of structured and

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,834
unstructured health care data from EHRs.

14
00:00:46,334 --> 00:00:51,034
And the integration, seamless imaging
of disparate healthcare system and data

15
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:56,184
format while maintaining data integrity,
quality and HIPAA compliance standards.

16
00:00:56,854 --> 00:01:01,804
Processing, real time data transformation
and transcending using advanced ETL

17
00:01:01,884 --> 00:01:06,834
pipelines to prepare healthcare data
for immediate clinical use and analysis.

18
00:01:07,404 --> 00:01:08,964
And the fourth one is analysis.

19
00:01:09,314 --> 00:01:12,614
This is the implementation of
machine learning and statical models

20
00:01:12,994 --> 00:01:14,834
to extract actionable insights.

21
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:20,069
enabling data driven clinical decisions
and personalized treatment plans.

22
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:23,779
And what are all the advanced data
engineering techniques that have

23
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:26,009
been used for the better performance?

24
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:28,559
Number one is a real time ETL pipelines.

25
00:01:28,949 --> 00:01:31,569
Number two, scalable cloud architecture.

26
00:01:31,889 --> 00:01:33,989
Number three, AI driven analytics.

27
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:36,469
The real time ETL pipeline.

28
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:41,009
This enables continuous process
of patient data streams for

29
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,429
immediate clinical insights.

30
00:01:43,114 --> 00:01:47,334
This will facilitate rapid response
in critical care scenarios.

31
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:49,484
Scalable cloud architecture.

32
00:01:49,924 --> 00:01:55,734
This deploy flexible infrastructure that
dynamically adopts to process massive

33
00:01:55,734 --> 00:02:00,814
healthcare data sets while maintaining
HIPAA compliance high availability.

34
00:02:01,634 --> 00:02:06,414
AI driven analytics leverages Machine
learning algorithms to analyze

35
00:02:06,414 --> 00:02:12,204
complex medical data, identify early
disease indicators, and generate

36
00:02:12,254 --> 00:02:14,714
personalized treatment recommendations.

37
00:02:15,214 --> 00:02:17,804
Structuring and analyzing diverse data.

38
00:02:18,724 --> 00:02:22,804
Genomic sequencing, electronic
health records, medical

39
00:02:22,804 --> 00:02:25,354
imaging, IoT based monitoring.

40
00:02:26,054 --> 00:02:28,164
So how genomic sequencing is.

41
00:02:28,664 --> 00:02:33,874
Analyzing complete DNA profiles,
generating over 200 gigabytes of

42
00:02:33,884 --> 00:02:37,274
actionable genetics insights per patient.

43
00:02:37,894 --> 00:02:39,354
Electronic health records.

44
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:45,274
These longitudinal patients history,
including treatments, medication, and

45
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:47,634
outcome for informed decision making.

46
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:54,724
How medical imaging is helping in terms
of using the new technology, which

47
00:02:54,804 --> 00:02:59,094
delivers high resolution diagnosis,
visualization through x rays.

48
00:02:59,544 --> 00:03:03,254
MRIs and CT scans for precise analysis.

49
00:03:04,224 --> 00:03:05,554
IoT based monitoring.

50
00:03:05,844 --> 00:03:08,474
This streams continuous vital signs.

51
00:03:08,984 --> 00:03:14,414
and health metrics from wearable and
medical devices for proactive care.

52
00:03:14,914 --> 00:03:17,614
What are all the impacts
on the precision diagnosis?

53
00:03:18,294 --> 00:03:22,964
So AI diagnostic systems, this will
reduce the medical errors by 30

54
00:03:22,964 --> 00:03:27,834
percent and the machine learning models
enhance patient's risk assessment by

55
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:33,344
50 percent enabling early intervention
and preventive care strategies.

56
00:03:34,084 --> 00:03:38,544
Integration of AI driven diagnostics
results in 40 percent faster treatment.

57
00:03:39,184 --> 00:03:42,844
Initiations and 25%
better patient outcomes.

58
00:03:43,344 --> 00:03:46,934
We'll look at the case studies
for early disease detection.

59
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:52,254
So initially we collect the data in terms
of integrating genomic data, clinical

60
00:03:52,254 --> 00:03:56,844
records under real time monitoring
system to create a comprehensive patient

61
00:03:56,994 --> 00:03:59,544
profile across 50 plus health indicators.

62
00:04:00,044 --> 00:04:04,004
And we look in the pattern
recognization, applying the advanced

63
00:04:04,354 --> 00:04:08,814
machine learning algorithms to
analyze the potential data detecting.

64
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,379
This is markers with a 94 percent
accuracy through neural network

65
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,579
analysis, predictive modeling.

66
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:22,969
So leveraging AI driven predictive
models to forecast disease.

67
00:04:23,654 --> 00:04:28,994
Progression six to 12 months in advance,
enabling proactive treatment, planning

68
00:04:28,994 --> 00:04:32,074
and risk management, improved outcomes.

69
00:04:32,604 --> 00:04:37,964
We can achieve 40 percent faster
diagnostics time and 35 percent reduction

70
00:04:37,964 --> 00:04:43,764
in late stage disease progression through
early detection and intervention stages.

71
00:04:43,764 --> 00:04:48,224
Another case study is about
AI assisting drug discovery.

72
00:04:48,534 --> 00:04:51,594
Here we will process over 100
million molecular compounds.

73
00:04:52,394 --> 00:04:56,664
And the chemical interactions
daily reducing the candidate

74
00:04:56,664 --> 00:05:00,144
identification done by 60 percent
through advanced AI algorithms.

75
00:05:00,644 --> 00:05:04,084
And the target identification is
to utilize machine learning to

76
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:09,014
analyze protein drug interaction
across 100, 000 potential targets,

77
00:05:09,704 --> 00:05:15,414
achieving 85 percent accuracy in
predicting therapeutic effectiveness.

78
00:05:15,904 --> 00:05:20,974
Clinical trials, reducing traditional
drug development timeline from 10

79
00:05:20,974 --> 00:05:27,974
years to 4 years through AI optimized
trial design and patient matching

80
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:31,084
result in 40 percent cost reduction.

81
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:34,514
This is another case study with
a real time patient monitoring.

82
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:40,419
So we monitor the data streaming,
processing via 1000 plus vital signs

83
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:45,919
per second from wearable and bedside
monitors for comprehensive health track.

84
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:52,319
Anomaly Detection AI algorithms
analyze patterns to identify

85
00:05:52,749 --> 00:05:57,499
critical health changes with 95
percent accuracy within seconds.

86
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:02,729
Intervention This enables
rapid response teams to reduce

87
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:05,929
critical event response by 60%.

88
00:06:06,524 --> 00:06:12,254
Leading to better patient outcomes,
alerting the smart notification systems,

89
00:06:12,644 --> 00:06:18,794
prioritize and deliveries, urgent alert to
the right health care provider instantly.

90
00:06:19,294 --> 00:06:23,474
And what are the challenges in terms
of data security and compliance?

91
00:06:23,794 --> 00:06:27,864
So the first one is the trust and
then the compliance and the security.

92
00:06:28,124 --> 00:06:32,754
So these are the three main data security
and compliances we have to consider.

93
00:06:33,284 --> 00:06:38,754
the healthcare data security demands
robust production of sensitive patient

94
00:06:38,754 --> 00:06:44,244
information through state of the
art encryption and access controls.

95
00:06:44,794 --> 00:06:50,994
Strict adhere to HIPAA and GDPR
regulations requires comprehensive

96
00:06:51,264 --> 00:06:56,244
documentation, regular audit, and
careful management data access protocol.

97
00:06:56,844 --> 00:07:00,434
Building and maintaining patient
trust depends on transparent

98
00:07:00,434 --> 00:07:01,974
data handling practices.

99
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:06,919
ethical AI implementation and
clear communication about how their

100
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:09,249
information is used and protected.

101
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:15,099
So the healthcare industry faces
increasingly cyber security threats with

102
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,089
data breaching costing an average of 9.

103
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:21,409
2 million per incident.

104
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:26,529
Organization must balance the need
for data accessibility with engine

105
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,039
security measurement measures.

106
00:07:28,794 --> 00:07:33,934
While ensuring compliance with evolving
international regulations and what

107
00:07:33,934 --> 00:07:39,069
are the challenges while we harmonize
or integrate or standardize the data.

108
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:43,199
Healthcare system currently uses
over 40 different data standards,

109
00:07:43,549 --> 00:07:48,179
making standardization critical
for ensuring consistent data,

110
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:50,589
quality, and reliable analysis.

111
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:56,839
Integration across disparate systems
like EHRs, lab systems, and imaging

112
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:02,159
databases remain a significant
challenge with healthcare organizations.

113
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:07,279
spending an average of 500, 000
annually on integration effort.

114
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:13,489
Harmonizing data format is essential
for enabling seamless data exchange with

115
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:19,689
studies showing the standard standardized
data format can reduce analysis time by 65

116
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:23,739
percent and improve diagnostic accuracy.

117
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:31,839
40%. So here we see a data diagram of
expected improvement with personalized

118
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:36,749
medicine in terms of reduced adverse
reactions and also improved treatment.

119
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:40,189
And what are the actionable
insights for precision healthcare?

120
00:08:40,859 --> 00:08:44,199
We talk about build robust infrastructure,
leverage advanced techniques.

121
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:45,809
address key challenges.

122
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:50,589
These are the three actionable
insights for the precision health care.

123
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:55,259
So when we talk about the built robust
infrastructure, deeper and scalable

124
00:08:55,259 --> 00:09:02,119
data architecture that ensure HIPAA
compliance, data and storage system

125
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:06,719
and automated backup protocols to
handle increased volume of patient

126
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:09,149
data, leverage advanced techniques.

127
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:14,679
So implement the real time ETL
pipelines and AI powered analytics.

128
00:09:15,294 --> 00:09:21,184
to process patient data streams, enabling
rapid insight generation and predict

129
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:24,174
modeling for improved clinical outcomes.

130
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,314
Address key challenges.

131
00:09:26,864 --> 00:09:30,784
Proactively tackle security
vulnerabilities through end to

132
00:09:30,784 --> 00:09:35,554
end encryption while establishing
standardized data protocols to

133
00:09:35,874 --> 00:09:40,204
enhance system interoperability
across healthcare networks.

134
00:09:40,704 --> 00:09:42,214
Thank you very much for your time.
