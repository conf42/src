1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:00,800
Hello?

2
00:00:01,729 --> 00:00:03,559
I'm sorry, Krishna from Visa.

3
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:06,500
Thank you everyone for joining my session.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,399
In this session, I'm going to explore
how integrating blockchain with cloud

5
00:00:12,399 --> 00:00:18,850
native infrastructure and AI reshapes,
incident detection, triage, and recovery

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,740
in high volume payment networks.

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,349
I'll begin with why this is urgent.

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,640
Then outline the architecture and
automation patterns, quantify the impact

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,680
and close with a phase rollout plan and
key takeaways you can apply immediately.

10
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:34,930
Let's get started.

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,199
The urgent payment networks are the
circulator system of the global economy.

12
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,850
When a major institution suffer
disruption, losses cascade.

13
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,000
Today's pain points are threefold.

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,470
Firstly, the crippling blind spots, manual
ticketing and spreadsheets based tracking

15
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,870
leave gaps where emerging failures hide.

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,000
So teams often discover problems late.

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:02,620
Second extended outages, reactive
incident response, minutes to downtime

18
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:09,460
every handoff, P, delay and misted
alerts, customer impact, and also loss.

19
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,360
The third one, compliance catastrophes
when reporting is manual and fragmented.

20
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,980
Audits take longer evidence, quality,
suffer and regulatory exposure growth.

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,745
The takeaway is very clear.

22
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,545
We need a different operating model.

23
00:01:24,045 --> 00:01:27,215
Mastering unprecedented
resilience set of payment scale

24
00:01:27,215 --> 00:01:29,045
requires comprehensive approach.

25
00:01:29,285 --> 00:01:31,055
First, the high volume processing.

26
00:01:31,415 --> 00:01:35,045
We must seamlessly handle billions
of transactions across the platforms

27
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:39,515
like Visa and which six latency,
and also high availability goals.

28
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:40,805
Secondly.

29
00:01:41,765 --> 00:01:47,675
Continuous the 24 crossover monitoring of
health, performance and security events

30
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,530
across services, regions and providers.

31
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,370
Observability must weak signals not only
alarms that already cross the thresholds.

32
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,320
Third, mitigate
catastrophic downtime costs.

33
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,100
Outages can cause millions per
hour through loss, interchange,

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,860
chargebacks and reputational damage.

35
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:10,540
Preventing incidents and accelerating
recovery are business imperatives,

36
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,950
but not engineering goals.

37
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,230
Blockchain cloud.

38
00:02:13,725 --> 00:02:15,165
Transforming incident response.

39
00:02:15,665 --> 00:02:20,765
In this slide I'm going to explain
our thesis is to fuse blockchain's

40
00:02:20,915 --> 00:02:24,365
integrity with the elasticity
of cloud native infrastructure.

41
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:29,780
This yields trustworthy records,
automated workflows, and scale during

42
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,700
crisis immune immutable audit trails.

43
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:39,580
Every incident, event detection,
escalation mitigation, and recovery

44
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,050
is captured with cryptographic
verification to provide a tamper proof

45
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,480
history for postmortems and regulators.

46
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,480
Elastic scalable response.

47
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:53,910
Cloud resources expand and contract
to match incident severity,

48
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,320
ensuring stable performance under
heavy load while controlling cost.

49
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:04,040
And automated smart contracts,
predefined rule actions like paging,

50
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:10,040
flag flips, traffic shifting or rollback,
reducing human error, and shrinking.

51
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,820
Time to restore.

52
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,440
Moving on to next slide,
revolutionizing visibility.

53
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,900
Blockchain powered incident monitoring.

54
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,310
So as a step one, the
intelligent anomaly detection.

55
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:26,600
High sensors and AI models continuously
learn normal behavior across traffic

56
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:32,630
latency, error rates, dependency and
security events to surface deviations.

57
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,500
Very early.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,760
Step two, immutable event registration.

59
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:42,280
Each notable signal is timestamped and
recorded to the ledger, producing an

60
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,185
unalterable ordered chain of evidence that
survives tool changes or the human edits.

61
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,870
The third one, predictive
incident prevention with a

62
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,610
complete and trustworthy dataset.

63
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:00,010
Forecasting models identify leading
indicators such as saturation patterns

64
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,850
or the reverse so we can intervene
before the customer feels the pain.

65
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:04,769
Moving on.

66
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:06,949
Automated incident response.

67
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:07,669
Zero touch.

68
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:10,069
Operational resilience
with smart contracts.

69
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:12,249
Autonomous alert escalation.

70
00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:16,089
Severity aware rules, route
alerts to right on call person.

71
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,619
The leadership are also added, and
the partner teams are also added

72
00:04:19,619 --> 00:04:24,179
instantly with deduplication and
suppression to avoid noise floods,

73
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:29,959
dynamic resource optimization when
signals indicate load or degradation.

74
00:04:30,619 --> 00:04:34,879
Automation skills, replica warm
caches, most workload to healthier

75
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,349
zones, or expand network capacity
without waiting for the manual action.

76
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:42,070
The near instant system restoration.

77
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:47,979
When a rollback or failover criteria
is met, contract trigger safe

78
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:51,939
restoration to the last good known
state, including configure version,

79
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,579
traffic shifting and dependency gating

80
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,484
transforming resilience into profit.

81
00:04:57,374 --> 00:04:58,934
Quantify the operational edge.

82
00:04:59,434 --> 00:05:03,634
Our autonomous incident response
solutions don't just promise resilience.

83
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:06,574
They deliver measurable,
tangible business value.

84
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:11,524
We empower you to clearly demonstrate
how zero touch operations translate

85
00:05:11,884 --> 00:05:14,254
directly into the significant ROI.

86
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:19,174
Reduce costs, enhance deficiency,
and a powerful competitive advantage.

87
00:05:19,744 --> 00:05:24,304
Witness the compelling data that
pro our impact on your bottom line.

88
00:05:24,804 --> 00:05:29,264
Transforming operations driving
measurable impact the precision in alerts.

89
00:05:29,594 --> 00:05:34,214
Fewer positive alert means Internet's
focus on real threats, improving signal

90
00:05:34,214 --> 00:05:36,524
to noise, and also reducing alert fatigue.

91
00:05:37,024 --> 00:05:38,824
The rapid incident resolution.

92
00:05:39,574 --> 00:05:44,739
Automated run books usually shorten
detection, triage, and mitigation.

93
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:49,199
Compressing mean compressing the
meantime to acknowledgement and recovery.

94
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:55,814
Stability analytics, maintenance before
end result is customer satisfaction.

95
00:05:55,944 --> 00:05:57,494
Fewer and

96
00:05:57,994 --> 00:05:58,214
go.

97
00:05:58,214 --> 00:05:59,014
Moving on to next slide.

98
00:05:59,544 --> 00:06:01,374
Anticipate failures.

99
00:06:01,874 --> 00:06:05,234
We analyze historical transaction
flows and performance trends to

100
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:09,644
forecast where the risk is a rising,
for example, a service reaching

101
00:06:09,794 --> 00:06:14,654
saturation during weekend peaks or a
dependency with increasing tail latency.

102
00:06:15,344 --> 00:06:19,794
We red the subtle anomalies during
the drift in the percentile, 50

103
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:24,654
latency that proceeds to the personnel
99 spikes and correlate them with

104
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:27,399
deploy feature flags and infra.

105
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:32,399
We optimize capacity using productive
models, and we schedule automated

106
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:37,889
preventive maintenance such as node
replacement or canary restarts before

107
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:40,529
minor issue escalates into an incident.

108
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:42,059
We usually do all these.

109
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:43,339
Moving on to next one.

110
00:06:43,609 --> 00:06:47,209
Dynamic scaling cloud native agility
for uninterrupted operations.

111
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:48,859
The baseline stability.

112
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:53,869
This runs with right size, capacity,
and budgets during normal periods while

113
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:57,819
preserving headroom for the sudden
spike the proactive demand sensing,

114
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:03,609
detect early signs of surge marketing
campaigns, holiday traffic partner

115
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:06,699
cutovers, and we scale preemptively.

116
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:13,049
Rapid capacity expansions, elasticity
at compute storage, network

117
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:16,529
throughput, or regional endpoints to
absorb peak loads without throttling

118
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:18,839
the efficiency optimization.

119
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:24,569
As demand subsides automatically
scale back down resources and

120
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,369
keeping unit economic safety.

121
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:30,729
Accelerating operational excellence
basically by applying this

122
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:34,374
operational model in high volume
environments, yields concrete outcomes.

123
00:07:34,874 --> 00:07:38,474
Substantial reduction in manual
intervention through codified runbooks

124
00:07:38,564 --> 00:07:43,384
as policy, as code significantly
accelerated incident resolution time

125
00:07:43,384 --> 00:07:47,364
due to automated detection, routing,
and the rollback higher compliance

126
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:51,714
reporting accuracy, because every
step is recorded in immutably and is

127
00:07:51,714 --> 00:07:56,084
easy to reconstruct during audits,
streamline post incident analysis,

128
00:07:56,234 --> 00:08:00,904
precise timelines, correlated evidence,
and objective and objective metrics.

129
00:08:01,404 --> 00:08:02,064
Implementation.

130
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:05,804
So assess current
infrastructure map services,

131
00:08:06,304 --> 00:08:07,984
identify integration points.

132
00:08:08,484 --> 00:08:10,194
Firstly, the initial pilot deployment.

133
00:08:10,764 --> 00:08:13,364
Choose a non-critical but
representative service.

134
00:08:13,664 --> 00:08:17,984
Start by recording detection and
response events to ledger, validate

135
00:08:17,984 --> 00:08:19,844
latency and storage overheads.

136
00:08:20,654 --> 00:08:25,724
Develop smart contracts, encode common
playbooks like degraded latency,

137
00:08:25,724 --> 00:08:31,764
rollback, circuit on dependency,
saturation, and surgical scaling policies

138
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:34,329
with clear guardrails and approvals.

139
00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:38,129
Rollout to the production, expand
coverage to mission critical

140
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:42,389
services and cross team visibility
dashboards, and tune policy based

141
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,879
on live results under perspectives,

142
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:47,989
fortify compliance and enhanced
security with blockchain.

143
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:53,024
The immutable audit trails topographic
proves makes evident tamper evident.

144
00:08:53,524 --> 00:08:57,544
Helping regulators and Foreign Six
trust the timeline of the actions taken.

145
00:08:58,414 --> 00:09:02,554
Automated compliance reporting generate
accurate, consistent reports straight

146
00:09:02,554 --> 00:09:06,694
from the ledger and telemetry, reducing
manual compilation and the human error.

147
00:09:07,194 --> 00:09:11,454
The realtime transfer provide
stakeholders with control, immediate

148
00:09:11,454 --> 00:09:15,769
visible teams into incident status
actions in flight and recovery progress.

149
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:19,449
Future proofing defense,
staying ahead of threats.

150
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:24,059
The quantum resistant en encryption
prepared for advances in compute

151
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:27,629
by adopting algorithms designed to
withstand new classes of attack.

152
00:09:28,349 --> 00:09:32,909
The decentralized threat validation use
distributed conscious to corroborate

153
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:37,709
emerging indicators of compromise and
reduce single point by US automated.

154
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:43,159
Propagate valid threat intelligence
across teams and regions instantly.

155
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,509
So defense aligned quickly.

156
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:49,549
The AI power detection continuously
retrain model on fresh, trustworthy

157
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:53,359
data to improve precision and
recall as all the landscape evolves.

158
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:54,489
The key takeaway.

159
00:09:54,989 --> 00:09:59,189
Anticipate sophisticated threats
and them earlier with adaptive

160
00:09:59,189 --> 00:10:01,079
controls and verbal evidence.

161
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:05,939
The UN reality, decentralized
plus AI assisted operational

162
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:08,819
availability and recovery time.

163
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:13,879
S value creation resilience, reduces
the risk, protects revenue, and

164
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:18,409
improve ROI through lower downtime
and greater operational efficiency.

165
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:22,119
The proactive threat neutralization
move from firefighting to

166
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:25,749
foresight with predictive analytics
and policy driven automation.

167
00:10:26,249 --> 00:10:29,994
Rapid and automated response use
smart contracts like rules to trigger

168
00:10:30,054 --> 00:10:33,179
the right actions at the right
time with minimum human latency.

169
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,419
Enhance stress and transparency, immutable
logs and clear operational visibility.

170
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:40,879
Build conference with
partners and regulators.

171
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:45,219
Optimize operational efficiency, fewer
manual touch points, standardized

172
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:48,849
workflows, and better cost control
across the incident lifecycle.

173
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:50,249
Thank you for watching.

174
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,089
I'm Krishna.
