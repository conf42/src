1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,189
Everyone, thank you for
joining me at Con 2025.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,380
I'm bas, and today we are gonna
dive into one of the most exciting

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,190
frontiers in modern systems,
AI driven self infrastructure.

4
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:17,650
Over the next 20 minutes, I'll walk you
through how AI is evolving s monitoring

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,390
and automation into systems that can
truly detect, recover, and improve.

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,300
Just someone who tired of waking up at
3:00 AM incidents in the right place.

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,200
Let's explore how the future of
infrastructure is becoming not only

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,540
smarter, but truly resilient by design.

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,410
Let's talk about why this
conversation is so critical.

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,310
Why AI driven self-heal infrastructure
is more than just buzzword.

11
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,300
We are operating in a world
where S isn't optional anymore.

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,770
It's mission critical.

13
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,280
The complexity of what we
manage today is staggering.

14
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,390
Modern cloud infrastructure spans
thousands of interconnected services.

15
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,600
Manual oversight just
isn't scalable anymore.

16
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,190
Even the best engineers can't
babysit every node, every container,

17
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,900
every function, 24 by seven.

18
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,310
On top of that, our current
systems are still largely reactive.

19
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,140
We wait for alerts, we jump on
incidents, we write postmortems, and

20
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,610
in high availability environments.

21
00:01:13,955 --> 00:01:17,105
Especially in healthcare,
finance or e-commerce, that

22
00:01:17,105 --> 00:01:18,275
model just doesn't cut it.

23
00:01:18,775 --> 00:01:20,395
Downtime isn't just inconvenient.

24
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:21,445
It's expensive.

25
00:01:22,225 --> 00:01:26,665
We are talking about millions in lost
revenue annually, or even brief outages.

26
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,735
That's why the shift matters.

27
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:30,535
AI changes the paradigm.

28
00:01:31,165 --> 00:01:35,545
Instead of responding after things go
wrong, we can predict, prevent, and

29
00:01:35,545 --> 00:01:37,435
heal before users are even impact.

30
00:01:38,245 --> 00:01:41,845
This is where we even move from
firefighting to future proofing.

31
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,850
Today, I want to show you
how exactly we got it.

32
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,970
Let's take a quick look at how SRE
has evolved over the years, because

33
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,750
understanding this evolution gives
us context for where we are headed.

34
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,204
We have started with SRE
1.0, a phase with operations.

35
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:01,334
Were largely man engineers.

36
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:02,565
Were constantly on call.

37
00:02:03,065 --> 00:02:07,145
Basic monitoring tools helped, but the
response models are still reactive.

38
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:12,275
This is also when we first saw
the idea of error budgets, helping

39
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:14,255
balance reliability with innovation.

40
00:02:15,155 --> 00:02:18,445
Then came SRE 2.0 where things
really started to shift.

41
00:02:19,255 --> 00:02:24,265
We embraced automation with infrastructure
as code scripted remediation and alerting.

42
00:02:24,295 --> 00:02:25,165
That got a bit smarter.

43
00:02:25,165 --> 00:02:28,315
Chaos engineering also started to emerge.

44
00:02:28,644 --> 00:02:30,204
Testing resiliency proactively.

45
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,734
We moved from just monitoring to
observability, not just knowing

46
00:02:33,734 --> 00:02:35,624
something broke, but wide broke.

47
00:02:36,124 --> 00:02:41,584
Now we are entering SR 3.0, a new era
where systems are becoming autonomous.

48
00:02:42,424 --> 00:02:45,784
We are talking about predictive
healing, where AI anticipates

49
00:02:45,784 --> 00:02:47,404
problems before they happen.

50
00:02:48,214 --> 00:02:49,804
Engineers don't just respond anymore.

51
00:02:50,194 --> 00:02:52,954
They architect systems
that respond themselves.

52
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:57,769
It's a strategic role now, designing
guardrails, training AI models,

53
00:02:57,859 --> 00:03:00,109
and ensuring systems evolve safely.

54
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:04,489
And this shift into AI native
SRE isn't just exciting.

55
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:08,779
It's necessary because systems are
scaling faster than humans can keep up.

56
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:12,229
So let's explore what makes AI
powered self-healing possible.

57
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:13,164
Now, let's.

58
00:03:13,664 --> 00:03:14,414
It's not magic.

59
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:17,864
It's a structured progression
that builds intelligence into

60
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,604
the systems stage by stage.

61
00:03:20,354 --> 00:03:21,494
It starts with detection.

62
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:27,284
AI systems, monitor logs, metrics and
signals, identifying anomalies that

63
00:03:27,284 --> 00:03:29,174
a human operator might never notice.

64
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:34,994
We are talking about subtle changes
in behavior where edge failures or

65
00:03:34,994 --> 00:03:37,209
slowly building patterns that don't.

66
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:40,260
That feels slow, but never
breaks during the demo.

67
00:03:40,589 --> 00:03:41,880
AI catches those moments.

68
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,220
Next, machine learning kicks in with
production models are trained on

69
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,590
historical data and live telemetry.

70
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:53,119
The forecast failures are sometimes
even days before they actually happen.

71
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,470
This lets us shift from reactive
firefighting to preventative

72
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,620
action, then comes remediation.

73
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,840
This is where AI really flexes.

74
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,810
It can autonomously trigger
corrective workflows.

75
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:10,060
Whether it's restarting services, draining
traffic from a failure node, or scaling

76
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,770
a specific region, the goal is rapid
resolution with zero human intervention.

77
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,169
And finally, optimization.

78
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,470
Each incidents become
a learning opportunity.

79
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:26,110
AI systems use postmodern data to refine
future predictions, reduce noise, and

80
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,419
adapt to all infrastructure behaviors.

81
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,130
This feedback loop creates a smarter,
more resilient system over time.

82
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,120
All four stages, detection,
prediction, remediation, or

83
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,159
optimization build on each other.

84
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,900
In mature systems, we are seeing
up to 85% incident healing

85
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,909
accuracy without human involvement.

86
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,320
That's the real magic, continuous
improvement without burnout.

87
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,540
Let's take a quick look at how one of the
biggest streaming platforms in the world.

88
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,110
Netflix is putting AI powered
self-healing into action.

89
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,870
Netflix uses a tool called Chat
the Chaos Automation platform.

90
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,180
It leverages machine learning to
proactively search for resilience gaps

91
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,280
before real users even notice them.

92
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,330
Think of it like a in very intelligent
troublemaker in the system.

93
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,800
It tries to break things on purpose, but
only to make even everything stronger.

94
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,600
It sharper the false
it injects Aren random.

95
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,400
They're based on calculated risk models,
simulating the most likely points

96
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,410
of failure with surgical precision.

97
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,540
It's not chaos for chaos sake.

98
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,220
It's chaos with intent.

99
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,620
What about the results?

100
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,940
The speak volumes.

101
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:41,040
Netflix cut their entity by 30
to 50% and proactively prevented

102
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,380
over 200 outages in just one year.

103
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,610
In just 2023.

104
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:49,365
That's hundreds of moments where you
didn't even get the spinning buffer

105
00:05:49,365 --> 00:05:54,345
icon mid episode, and that's a win for
both reliability and user satisfaction.

106
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:56,915
And one of the most powerful outcomes.

107
00:05:57,695 --> 00:06:00,575
SRE now focus less on firefighting
and moral architecture.

108
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:05,345
They are not just reacting, they are
building proactively with strategy.

109
00:06:05,405 --> 00:06:05,585
And

110
00:06:06,085 --> 00:06:07,975
now let's shift to another tech giant.

111
00:06:08,475 --> 00:06:13,035
Where the focus is on precision at
scale, meta runs tens of thousands of

112
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:17,955
servers and detecting subtle behavior
failure signals across all of them is

113
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:22,335
like spotting a signal, single flickering
light bulb across an entire city.

114
00:06:22,835 --> 00:06:25,865
That's where machine learning
steps in analyzing telemetry,

115
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:30,425
where millions of components catch
signatures before they escalate.

116
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:35,665
Here is where it gets futuristic
when the AI reaches 85% confidence.

117
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:37,225
A failure is imminent.

118
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:38,935
The system doesn't wait.

119
00:06:39,505 --> 00:06:44,875
It proactively migrates or migrates
workloads long before any human

120
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,285
would typically react to it.

121
00:06:47,215 --> 00:06:51,295
It's like watching the weather and
evacuating before the storm instead of

122
00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:53,995
rebuilding after it hits the outcome.

123
00:06:54,445 --> 00:06:57,115
76% of potential failures preventive.

124
00:06:57,595 --> 00:07:02,935
A 23% boost in capacity planning,
and over $45 million saved annually.

125
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:06,115
That's not just resilience,
that's remarkable.

126
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:06,415
ROI.

127
00:07:06,915 --> 00:07:10,365
And that little chat you see
there, that's the AI predictions,

128
00:07:10,455 --> 00:07:11,805
outpacing actual failures.

129
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:14,445
It's not perfect, but it gets close.

130
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:17,865
And at meta scale even, a
few percentage points matter.

131
00:07:18,365 --> 00:07:22,775
Let's shift our focus to Microsoft
Azure, a company operating at massive

132
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:26,555
global scale managing services
for millions across industries.

133
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:31,735
Fully AI driven self infrastructure
and the results are both

134
00:07:31,735 --> 00:07:33,055
measurable and inspiring.

135
00:07:33,865 --> 00:07:36,295
First, they have seen a 65% reduction.

136
00:07:36,795 --> 00:07:41,295
That means AI is filtering of
the A charter and surfacing

137
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,585
only actionable incidents.

138
00:07:43,185 --> 00:07:46,635
Think of it as noise canceling
headphones, but for your operations team.

139
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:50,809
Then comes uptime
improvement, jumping by 35%.

140
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,329
Autonomous remediation means systems are
no longer waiting on a human to jump in.

141
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,049
They're healing themselves,
keeping services running smoothly.

142
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:04,069
The most impressive number,
90% auto resolution.

143
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,030
That means the vast majority of
common incidents are resolved

144
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:09,799
entirely without human intervention.

145
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,070
For sre, this translates
to a shift from meaningful.

146
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,190
Of course, cost reduction.

147
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:21,350
A leaner smart infrastructure leads
to a 44% drop in operational expenses.

148
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,980
That's the kind of number
that speaks to both the tech

149
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,480
teams and as well as the CFO.

150
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:31,030
This case highlights what's possible
when AI is embedded, not just as

151
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,990
an assistant, but as an autonomous
partner in infrastructure resilience.

152
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,570
Azure, just automating task.

153
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,730
It's reimagining the.

154
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,750
Now we have seen how AI can
transform infrastructure,

155
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,190
reliability, and resilience.

156
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,620
But let's ground ourselves for a moment.

157
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,150
The reality is AI in SRE isn't
all magic and automation.

158
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,575
It comes with a unique set of challenges
that we must be intentional about first.

159
00:08:56,715 --> 00:09:01,560
Explainability AI systems
often behave like black boxes.

160
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,700
They make decisions and the
team is let wondering why.

161
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,270
This creates accountability gaps,
especially during incidents when every

162
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,790
second and every insight matters.

163
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,650
Second, human oversight.

164
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:20,975
Finding a balance between trust and
control is tough too little automation,

165
00:09:21,155 --> 00:09:25,955
and we miss opportunities for efficiency
too much, and we risk over resilience.

166
00:09:26,495 --> 00:09:29,465
Something that can backfire
during edge cases or.

167
00:09:29,965 --> 00:09:35,485
AI systems, infrastructure level across
access becomes new attack surfaces.

168
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:39,355
We're not talking about ML
poisoning, where the model

169
00:09:39,355 --> 00:09:41,335
itself becomes the vulnerability.

170
00:09:41,845 --> 00:09:43,395
This isn't science fiction anymore.

171
00:09:43,845 --> 00:09:45,075
It's an emerging reality.

172
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:49,905
It finally, bias and blind
spots, your model is only as

173
00:09:49,905 --> 00:09:51,435
good as the data it learns from.

174
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:56,535
And if your data carries historical biases
or lacks representation for each cases.

175
00:09:56,925 --> 00:09:59,055
The system will inherit those flaws.

176
00:09:59,745 --> 00:10:02,025
This can lead to unequal
reliability outcomes.

177
00:10:02,595 --> 00:10:06,285
So while the potential of AI
and SI is massive, it depends.

178
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:08,775
It demands maturity, caution, and clarity.

179
00:10:09,465 --> 00:10:13,455
If we don't solve these challenges with
intentionally, we are simply trading

180
00:10:13,575 --> 00:10:15,285
one set of problems for another.

181
00:10:15,785 --> 00:10:16,325
Take moment.

182
00:10:16,385 --> 00:10:17,930
Zoom this going.

183
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:22,560
Assist mostly with anomaly
detection and noise reduction.

184
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,590
It's helpful, but still reactive.

185
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,730
In the next two to three years,
we enter the transformation phase.

186
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,590
This is where AI begin handling
known issues autonomously.

187
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,190
Auto healing becomes a norm
for common failure patterns.

188
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,380
It's not just alerting anymore.

189
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,220
It's fixing.

190
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,965
This shift will begin to reshape
how S teams are structured.

191
00:10:44,465 --> 00:10:48,875
From reactive firefighting to
strategic oversight roles, as we

192
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:52,625
mature into phase three, AI native
reliability platforms will dominate.

193
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,105
This means SRE won't just
manage infrastructure.

194
00:10:56,615 --> 00:11:01,235
They will take on new roles like training
AI systems, evaluating critical decisions,

195
00:11:01,565 --> 00:11:02,975
and setting governance policies.

196
00:11:03,845 --> 00:11:08,225
The reliability stack will be
AI first by design, and finally,

197
00:11:08,615 --> 00:11:10,055
we'll reach the reinvention phase.

198
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:16,700
Where AI systems don't just follow rules,
they evolve, they learn, adapt, and

199
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,100
redesign their own operational processes.

200
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,040
Human engineers will take on higher
roles guiding innovation, defining

201
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,790
ethical boundaries, and managing
the complex relationship between

202
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,830
autonomous systems and human oversight.

203
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,830
If we think, if it think
of it as a timeline.

204
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,430
Now AI assists next three to two.

205
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,185
Two to three years.

206
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:39,225
AI auto heals.

207
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:46,990
Five to AI infrastructure that learns,
and this isn't Afic science fiction, it's

208
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,350
organizations, and

209
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:50,360
let's bring

210
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,079
AI.

211
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:56,740
It transforms, SRE from reactive support
to a forward looking discipline that

212
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:02,319
proactively ensures reliability at scale,
SREs become architects of resilience.

213
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,540
Second, human element.

214
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,400
AI doesn't replace us.

215
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,540
It needs us.

216
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,770
Engineers remain essential to
tune models, validate decisions,

217
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,180
and ensure outcomes aligned with
business and ethical expectations.

218
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,490
Move from scripted writers.

219
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:23,995
Signal interpreters from hands on
troubleshooters to strategic AI trainers.

220
00:12:24,835 --> 00:12:26,064
Third, start small.

221
00:12:26,905 --> 00:12:27,985
You don't need a moonshot.

222
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,025
Begin with your biggest pain point.

223
00:12:30,415 --> 00:12:32,635
Observability, remediation, or ity.

224
00:12:33,135 --> 00:12:38,695
Even incremental AI integration here can
yield massive ROI As and as trust goes.

225
00:12:39,055 --> 00:12:41,665
So does the, and this part is important.

226
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:42,985
AI doesn't.

227
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:45,585
It's a force multiplier, not a substitute.

228
00:12:46,035 --> 00:12:49,785
What matters most is thoughtful
implementation, not flashy

229
00:12:49,785 --> 00:12:51,765
use cases, but focused impact.

230
00:12:52,265 --> 00:12:55,745
That wraps up our journey into AI
driven self-healing infrastructure.

231
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,495
Thank you so much for your
time, your attention, and your

232
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:01,444
curiosity throughout this keynote.

233
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:04,805
I hope this gave you fresh
insight into where site

234
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,140
reliability engineering is headed.

235
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,435
Ideas, challenges,
conversation, going, thank.
