1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,540
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,260
Good morning.

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,410
This is Achi ma. I'm here to talk
about AI and bi, the Future of

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,700
Intelligent Healthcare Analytics.

5
00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:13,880
Today we are discussing about how in
healthcare organizations are evolving

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,750
their data analytics by blending
conventional business intelligence

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,570
with sophisticated AI capabilities.

8
00:00:21,049 --> 00:00:25,880
We are going from the typical structured
reports and dashboards to platform.

9
00:00:26,299 --> 00:00:30,320
That uses a machine learning, natural
language processing and computer vision.

10
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:35,090
These conversions in facilitating
tremendous achievements in fraud

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,750
detection, predictive modeling
for chronic diseases management,

12
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,790
and automated KPI monitoring.

13
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,230
Let's see how these technologies
combine to build an intelligent

14
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,550
healthcare analytics system.

15
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:53,450
Laying the ground for more efficient
and responsive healthcare environment.

16
00:00:53,949 --> 00:00:54,644
The shift from.

17
00:00:55,209 --> 00:00:57,999
Conventional BI to analytics with ai.

18
00:00:58,779 --> 00:01:03,939
Traditional BI has been our go-to
for building structured reports for

19
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:09,850
years, but it relies on preexisting
templates and queries that limits its

20
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,310
ability to detect hidden patterns.

21
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:17,979
With healthcare information now doubting
every 73 days and 80% of it is an

22
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:23,949
unstructured data, traditional methods can
no longer handle this AI driven analytics.

23
00:01:24,294 --> 00:01:29,424
Turns this on its head by leveraging
machine learning to detect patterns,

24
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:33,775
natural language processing, to
extract meaning from vast quantities

25
00:01:33,775 --> 00:01:39,505
of clinical documents and computer
visions, vision to read images.

26
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:40,664
This is clear.

27
00:01:40,664 --> 00:01:45,764
Move away from static descriptive
reporting to a dynamic system

28
00:01:45,794 --> 00:01:50,865
that provides predictive insights,
enabling us to react quickly to the

29
00:01:50,865 --> 00:01:52,905
constantly evolving data landscape.

30
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:56,915
Healthcare data growth versus
analytics capabilities.

31
00:01:57,415 --> 00:02:00,745
Look at the rate of change
in our data environment.

32
00:02:01,315 --> 00:02:08,155
Healthcare data is doubling every 73
days, and a staggering 80% of it is

33
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:13,584
an unstructured data with 1.2 billion
clinical documents generated each year.

34
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:19,195
The traditional BI systems were built
on a yearly doubling rate of 365 days.

35
00:02:20,065 --> 00:02:24,235
And that aren't completely built
to handle this kind of growth.

36
00:02:24,954 --> 00:02:30,325
Furthermore, AI enhanced analytics have
been shown to have improved performance.

37
00:02:31,315 --> 00:02:35,785
For example, recording over 90%
of sensitivity and specificity

38
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:42,385
in diabetic retinopathy detection
compared to 70% with traditional

39
00:02:42,385 --> 00:02:48,355
methods, and by 2025, healthcare
data will reach 25,000 petabytes.

40
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:54,685
A far cry for the 5,000 petabytes that
these legacy systems were built for.

41
00:02:55,375 --> 00:03:00,894
The reality says everything about
why a new AI driven approach isn't

42
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:06,554
just preferable, but is required
fraud detection or claims processing.

43
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:12,109
in healthcare, fraud is significant
problem costing the industry

44
00:03:12,589 --> 00:03:14,419
billions of dollars every year.

45
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:18,039
Three to 10% of total expenditures.

46
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:23,639
Rule-based fraud detection systems are
frequently outsmarted by complex fraud

47
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:30,259
schemes, reducing false positive rates
as high as 60% system augmented with

48
00:03:30,649 --> 00:03:35,209
artificial intelligence and business
intelligence features, examining billing

49
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,149
patterns and apply emission learning
techniques to identify statical anomalies.

50
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:47,229
Such system can achieve 70% to 90%
accuracy rates for fraud detection

51
00:03:47,529 --> 00:03:52,359
while simultaneously lowering
false positives by 30 to 50%.

52
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,159
This flexible approach enables new
fraud patterns to be discounted

53
00:03:57,429 --> 00:04:02,819
without requiring continued
continual reprogramming, thereby

54
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:07,109
allowing more efficient allocation
of investigate resources and

55
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:09,299
protection of financial systems.

56
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:15,549
Predictive modeling for managing chronic
diseases in chronic disease management.

57
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:20,049
Early identification and
intervention are paramount.

58
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:25,499
Business intelligence platforms
augmented with AI utilized sophisticated

59
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:29,249
algorithms such as deep learning
and conventional neural networks

60
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,000
to conduct risk satisfaction.

61
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,960
With predict two sensitivities above 80%.

62
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,530
Not only do these models forecast
treatment outcomes for individual patients

63
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:46,569
and potential side effects, but they
also forecast hospital readmissions

64
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:53,880
rates with accuracy ranging from 75
to 85% when such platform include, so

65
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,760
social determinants of health data.

66
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,760
These systems acquire a
deeper understanding of.

67
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,390
Patient risk and predictive
accuracy is increased by 10 to 20%.

68
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,700
This individualized approach
facilitates earlier intervention

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,280
and more personalized patient care.

70
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:21,279
Automated KPI monitoring ability,
manual tracking of KPIs on dozens

71
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,989
of metrics can be overwhelming.

72
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:28,319
A augmented business intelligence
automates this task by detecting

73
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:33,839
anomalies in real time and adjusting
sensitivity thresholds based on

74
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:41,429
historical context and contextual factors,
rather than innu, editing teams with

75
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:47,129
indistinguishable alerts the system
intellect intelligently prioritize

76
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:51,149
notifications, reducing low rate.

77
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:56,779
Alerts by 40 to 60%, thus
minimizing alert feting.

78
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:03,369
In addition, natural language generation
converts complex numerical information

79
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:10,149
into brief contextual relevant
narrative explanations, thus reducing

80
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:14,229
interpretations time by 20 to 30%.

81
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:17,064
This streamlined method allows.

82
00:06:17,594 --> 00:06:20,664
Teams to focus on most critical problems,

83
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:24,224
AI impact on healthcare
analytics performance.

84
00:06:24,724 --> 00:06:28,984
Here we contrast legacy systems
with those infused with ai.

85
00:06:29,484 --> 00:06:35,739
The performance graph indicates
definitely advances in a range of areas.

86
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:42,024
AI not only enhances fraud detection
and decrease false positives, but

87
00:06:42,024 --> 00:06:47,544
also enhance disease forecasting
and readmission prediction.

88
00:06:48,044 --> 00:06:53,024
Minimizing unwanted alerts further
enhances operational effectiveness.

89
00:06:53,894 --> 00:06:57,584
These performance gains
illustrate that combining AI

90
00:06:57,644 --> 00:07:00,494
is greater than a tech upgrade.

91
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:06,149
It's revolutionary solution that
yields tangible benefits in patient

92
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:08,459
care and re resource utilization,

93
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,199
implementation challenges,
data quality and integration.

94
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:18,259
While AI powered analytics offer
significant benefits, they deployment

95
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:20,299
is not without their challenges.

96
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:24,829
For instance, even established
electronic health record system

97
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:29,839
can have up to 65% of patient
records with missing critical data.

98
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:36,319
In addition, many healthcare organizations
are use responsible for an average of 16

99
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,959
clinical systems and 18 administrative
systems, which often do not communicate

100
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:46,429
with each other, thus making data
integration more and more challenging.

101
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:51,459
This is also an urgent need for
standardization of medical terminologies.

102
00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:57,189
Considering that coding variations
for the same clinical concepts

103
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:00,699
can be as high as 30 to 40%.

104
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:05,679
Addressing these challenges is
important to ensure the reliability

105
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:10,929
of our data to allow AI systems
to operate at their best level.

ensure consistent performance.

113
00:08:44,085 --> 00:08:48,515
Furthermore, thus, project
incorporating continuous clinical

114
00:08:48,515 --> 00:08:53,225
input have adoption rates around three
times greater than those without.

115
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:58,085
More than 80% of respondents point
to the need of understanding the

116
00:08:58,085 --> 00:08:59,495
limitations of these algorithms.

117
00:09:00,335 --> 00:09:04,385
