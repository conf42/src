00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,099
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,970
My name is Ravi Chandra,
principal salesforce developer

3
00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:05,640
and architect at Temple V capital.

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,560
Today.

5
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,350
I am thrilled to share how I have
transformed the borrower experience by

6
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,540
building a seamless and responsive loan
application portal on experience cloud

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,359
that is built on lightning platform.

8
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,310
This initiative wasn't just
about modernizing our technology.

9
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,689
It was about creating an
intuitive, efficient and accessible

10
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:27,400
experience for our borrowers.

11
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:33,100
In this session, we will explore the
key challenges, technical innovations,

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,110
and measurable improvements that
made this transformation possible.

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,539
Coming to the challenges,
desktop only limitation.

14
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:45,729
Before our transformation, we faced
significant challenges with our legacy

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,949
desktop only loan application system.

16
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,109
Accessibility was a major issue.

17
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:53,309
40 percent of our borrowers
could not complete loan

18
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:54,970
applications on mobile devices.

19
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,510
User frustration was another pain point.

20
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:03,310
A frequent timeout and compatibility
issues led to 65 percent increase

21
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,859
in support tickets with users
spending an additional 2.

22
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:08,390
5 hours to complete the loan application.

23
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:13,929
Lastly, we struggled with high
drop rates, 58 percent of user

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,640
abandonment applications midway,
often during complex form submissions.

25
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,699
These challenges were made it
clear that we need modern and

26
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:25,860
mobile friendly solutions.

27
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,890
Coming to Responsive Design Access
Anywhere, our solution was a fully

28
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:37,710
responsive borrower portal accessible
on mobile, both on iOS and Android OS.

29
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,210
Tablets and desktop.

30
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,200
For mobile users, we introduced
a touch optimized interface

31
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,380
for on the go loan application.

32
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:50,320
Tablet users benefited from an
intuitive experience, ideal for

33
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,119
reviewing and filling out applications.

34
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,330
Desktop users retained access to advanced
tools for detailed loan application

35
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,050
reviews and document management.

36
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:06,050
This multi device approach ensured a
seamless experience, allowing borrowers

37
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,599
to interact with their clients.

38
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:12,400
The portal anytime, anywhere coming
to the key portal functionalities

39
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,290
to create an efficient and user
friendly loan application portal.

40
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:18,669
We introduced four major functionalities.

41
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:24,020
Firstly, real time document uploads
allow users to secure submit.

42
00:02:24,425 --> 00:02:27,555
Securely submit and track
their documents with automatic

43
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:29,555
validation, ensuring completeness.

44
00:02:29,965 --> 00:02:34,445
Secondly, e signature integration
streamlined the process, reducing

45
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:38,705
paperwork and cutting closing time by 80%.

46
00:02:38,965 --> 00:02:43,094
Thirdly, personalized dashboards
provided borrowers with a clear,

47
00:02:43,474 --> 00:02:45,434
customized view of their loan status.

48
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,140
And upcoming tasks.

49
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:53,050
Finally, the in app messaging
enabled direct secure communication

50
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,749
with loan officers, reducing the
need of email and phone calls.

51
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:00,310
These features significantly
improved the borrower experience.

52
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,330
Coming to faster loan processing
time, one of the most significant

53
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,420
improvements was reducing loan processing
time for our underwriting team.

54
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,920
With automations and process
enhancements, we achieved a

55
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,300
30 percent process speed gain.

56
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:20,300
Previously, application took an
average of 25 minutes to complete.

57
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,790
Now the new portal borrowers can
finish the process in just 15 minutes.

58
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,900
Not only this improvement, not
only enhances efficiency, but also

59
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,810
improves borrower satisfaction by
eliminating unnecessary delays.

60
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,229
Coming to the technical improvements
to make this transformation possible.

61
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,520
We focused on three key
technical improvements.

62
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:46,885
Firstly, we eliminated 98, 95
percent of our system errors through

63
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:52,395
advanced error handling and automated
testing led to non zero downtime.

64
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:56,924
Secondly, we adopted mobile first
design, which increased mobile

65
00:03:56,924 --> 00:03:59,305
application completion rate by 60%.

66
00:03:59,745 --> 00:04:01,815
Finally, we redesigned the interface.

67
00:04:02,415 --> 00:04:07,715
With a user centric approach, reducing
average application time from 45 minutes

68
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:12,755
to just 15 minutes, while maintaining
a 98 percent user satisfaction rate.

69
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:14,865
Eco friendly digital solutions.

70
00:04:15,325 --> 00:04:18,975
Beyond improving efficiency,
our digital transformation also

71
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:20,595
contributed to sustainability.

72
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:25,300
We eliminated over 100, 000
pages of paper annually through

73
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,670
digital document processing.

74
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,660
By automating manual workflows,
we reduced processing time by 75

75
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,010
percent while conserving resources.

76
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,920
Additionally, our shift to paperless
operations and energy efficient systems

77
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,040
decreased our carbon footprints by 40%.

78
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:48,410
These changes align our commitment
to environmental responsibility

79
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,440
and operational efficiency.

80
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,150
Reduced support calls.

81
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,730
Our new loan application
portal dramatically improved

82
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,470
customer service efficiency.

83
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,000
Support calls related to
technical issues dropped by 40%.

84
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,240
Thanks to our self service feature
and an intuitive interface.

85
00:05:06,945 --> 00:05:10,165
With fewer borrowers needing
assistance, our support team could

86
00:05:10,165 --> 00:05:13,745
focus on more complex customer needs.

87
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:19,845
This in turn led to a 35 percent boost
in customer satisfaction score, showing

88
00:05:19,855 --> 00:05:24,275
that the improved user experience
directly contributed to happy borrowers.

89
00:05:24,775 --> 00:05:28,335
Coming to user expectations,
throughout this transformation,

90
00:05:28,385 --> 00:05:29,965
we learned several key lessons.

91
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,585
First, gathering user
feedback was crucial.

92
00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:38,119
Regular surveys and interviews
revealed that 78 percent of users

93
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,469
prioritized mobile accessibility.

94
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,750
Secondly, iterative design was essential.

95
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,630
We made five major UI improvements
based on borrower's feedback.

96
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:52,569
Finally, thorough testing ensured success.

97
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:57,229
We tested the loan application
portal with over 5, 000 users

98
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:02,289
across multiple devices, resulting
in a 92 percent satisfaction rate.

99
00:06:03,004 --> 00:06:07,674
These lessons helped us build in
a platform that not only meets.

100
00:06:08,544 --> 00:06:10,695
but exceeds borrower's expectation.

101
00:06:11,195 --> 00:06:15,655
Leveraging analytics to continuously
optimize the borrower experience.

102
00:06:15,965 --> 00:06:20,844
We leveraged Einstein analytics
in Salesforce in three key areas.

103
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:26,095
Firstly, we tracked user behavior to
analyze completion pattern and navigation

104
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:28,614
flows, improving the application process.

105
00:06:28,835 --> 00:06:30,895
Secondly, we identified and addressed.

106
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,210
Drop off points, reducing
the abandonment rates by 45%.

107
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:40,659
Finally, we monitored performance
metrics like load times and response

108
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,449
rates to ensure a seamless experience.

109
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,299
This data driven approach allows
us to refine and enhance the.

110
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:54,179
Portal continuously coming to mobile
first approach our loan application.

111
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:58,299
Our loan application portal
followed follows a structural

112
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:00,109
mobile first development cycle.

113
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:04,499

00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:08,950
an optimal experience for the 76
percent of borrowers who access.

115
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:11,430
Our services via mobile devices.

116
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:18,070
Next, we rigorously test the platform
across multiple different devices to

117
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:20,090
maintain functionality and usability.

118
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:24,939
Finally, we continuously optimize
based on real time user data,

119
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:29,149
improving performances, load
times, and touch interactions.

120
00:07:29,674 --> 00:07:35,564
This approach guarantees a seamless
experience across all mobile devices.

121
00:07:36,064 --> 00:07:37,514
Coming to key takeaways.

122
00:07:38,014 --> 00:07:42,764
In summary, our responsive design
transformation has resulted in 92 percent

123
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:45,325
user satisfaction rate across all devices.

124
00:07:45,904 --> 00:07:51,725

testing from 500 plus borrowers, we

128
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:15,335
have successfully built a platform
that puts borrower experience first.

129
00:08:15,984 --> 00:08:20,255
These results showcase the power of
innovation in financial services.

130
00:08:20,755 --> 00:08:24,434
