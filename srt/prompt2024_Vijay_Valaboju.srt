1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:00,900
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:08,309
My name is Vijay Kumar Balabhoju, and
welcome to CON42 Prompt Engineering 2024.

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:13,669
I'll walk you through the reinforcement
learning in AI driven assessments and

4
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:19,990
how this actually helps in enhancing
continuous learning and accessibility.

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,010
These are the topics that
I am going to cover today.

6
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,310
introduction to reinforcement
learning, and then, Theoretical

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,689
framework for, reinforcement learning.

8
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:33,259
Reinforcement learning, I will
sometimes substitute it for RL.

9
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:37,459
So, and, what are
personalized learning paths?

10
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:41,330
And then a real time adaptive assessments.

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,640
Accessibility and flexibility.

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,250
Continuous feedback and learning loop.

13
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,580
Gamification in learning.

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,910
Predictive learning and assessments.

15
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,850
And we will end with the
conclusion and future directions.

16
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,930
introduction to reinforcement
learning, right?

17
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:03,409
And what is reinforcement learning?

18
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:07,559
The definition is, it's a branch
of machine learning focused on how

19
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:13,439
agents should take actions in an
environment to maximize cumulative

20
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:15,399
rewards through trial and error method.

21
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:19,979
And what's the importance of this
is, with the increasing demand

22
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,109
for personalized education,
reinforcement learning offers adaptive

23
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:28,859
solutions, that cater to individual
learning preferences and styles.

24
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:34,069
And the primary goal for this one is,
the primary objective is to create

25
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:39,809
intelligent systems that adaptively
optimize for learning experiences,

26
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:44,649
enabling continuous skill development
and improving educational outcomes.

27
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:45,419
Right.

28
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:48,469
theoretical framework of
learning reinforcement.

29
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:49,559
Reinforcement learning.

30
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:51,969
we have, agent.

31
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:55,069
Basically, these are the key
components I'm going to cover.

32
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:56,579
we have an agent.

33
00:01:56,829 --> 00:01:58,519
An agent represents the learner.

34
00:01:59,089 --> 00:02:00,789
Or an adaptive learning system.

35
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:05,139
And then we have an environment,
which refers to the context in

36
00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:09,959
which the learning takes place,
including content and assessments.

37
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:13,499
And then we have a state action reward.

38
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:19,689
These are the core elements where a state
represents the learner's knowledge level.

39
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:23,709
Actions are the choices made by the agent.

40
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:28,549
And the rewards, are like
providing feedback on performance.

41
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:33,079
Now let's cover the, personalized
learning paths, right?

42
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:38,399
Basically, a learning path,
is an essential concept which

43
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:43,689
provides a direction, and, with a
definitive goal for a learner on

44
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:45,209
what they are trying to achieve.

45
00:02:45,514 --> 00:02:50,544
And, with a learning path, it
actually enables the learner to take

46
00:02:50,544 --> 00:02:52,714
a certain path to reach the goal.

47
00:02:52,774 --> 00:02:58,044
basically, what are the things that the
person need to learn through the journey

48
00:02:58,524 --> 00:03:01,114
of learning to achieve the end goal.

49
00:03:01,354 --> 00:03:03,774
And when it comes to a
personalized learning paths,

50
00:03:03,824 --> 00:03:05,544
I've divided it into two things.

51
00:03:05,594 --> 00:03:09,684
Basically, one is a dynamic curriculum
adjustment, and another one is the

52
00:03:09,684 --> 00:03:12,024
performance based learning optimization.

53
00:03:12,524 --> 00:03:14,354
What is a dynamic curriculum adjustment?

54
00:03:15,134 --> 00:03:21,104
It is actually an RL based system
analyzing learners performance

55
00:03:21,604 --> 00:03:24,834
in real time, allowing them to
modify the curricula instantly.

56
00:03:25,704 --> 00:03:29,754
For example, if a learner excels
in math, the system can introduce

57
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:33,954
more advanced topics without
a traditional waiting period.

58
00:03:34,624 --> 00:03:39,414
Now, when it comes to performance based,
in this case, by monitoring metrics such

59
00:03:39,414 --> 00:03:45,084
as accuracy and response time, the system
ensures that the learner face appropriate

60
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:50,404
challenges which promotes effective
learning and prevents frustration.

61
00:03:50,904 --> 00:03:53,744
Real time adaptive assessments, right?

62
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,684
what it means is, basically, this
RL algorithm continuously assesses

63
00:03:58,234 --> 00:04:04,264
learners performance, making real time
adjustments to question Difficulty

64
00:04:04,264 --> 00:04:07,354
to keep, to question difficulty
to keep learners engaged and

65
00:04:07,444 --> 00:04:09,204
accurately measure their knowledge.

66
00:04:09,694 --> 00:04:12,484
Basically, it's all about the
engagement and stuff, right?

67
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:17,624
as the learner makes a process,
progress, with their assessments, these,

68
00:04:17,684 --> 00:04:24,394
RL algorithms, they assess in real
time and then adjust the difficulty

69
00:04:24,394 --> 00:04:29,204
level as per the, the responses
that is provided by the learner.

70
00:04:29,614 --> 00:04:31,814
Take for an example, a
case study here, right?

71
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:36,544
A software developer preparing for a
cloud computing certification, right?

72
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:41,564
Now this case, in this case, this
RL algorithms, they benefit this

73
00:04:41,564 --> 00:04:46,014
learner, from targeted questions based
on their strengths and weaknesses.

74
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:50,654
And now what this ensures is a well
rounded preparation strategy for

75
00:04:50,654 --> 00:04:54,514
the person to achieve their end
goal, which in this case is a cloud

76
00:04:54,514 --> 00:04:56,624
computing certification, right?

77
00:04:57,124 --> 00:05:00,244
Now, when it comes to accessibility
and flexibility, right?

78
00:05:00,574 --> 00:05:04,914
we're talking about, reinforcement
learning, AI driven assessments, right?

79
00:05:05,034 --> 00:05:10,324
basically, these assessments
can be taken care taken, by the

80
00:05:10,324 --> 00:05:12,804
learner anytime, anywhere, right?

81
00:05:13,234 --> 00:05:16,324
Meaning, a learner can access the
assessment at their convenience,

82
00:05:17,104 --> 00:05:21,089
accommodating various schedule and
the lifestyle, which is particularly

83
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:25,399
beneficial for, working professional
and remote learners, right?

84
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:30,319
So that's, anytime, anywhere, it's at
the convenience of the learner, right?

85
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:35,329
And then, across device learning
continuity, basically, we deal

86
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:37,159
with many devices these days.

87
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:41,769
Laptops, computer, like the phones, and,
even a smartwatch and things like that.

88
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:47,914
Now, this Reinforcement learning
powered platform allows learner to

89
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:53,044
switch seamlessly between devices,
such as from a laptop to a smartphone.

90
00:05:53,574 --> 00:05:57,504
Now that ensures the continuity
in their learning experience.

91
00:05:58,004 --> 00:06:00,244
Now, implications for remote learning.

92
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:04,744
These systems, these systems, they provide
personalized feedback that enhances

93
00:06:04,744 --> 00:06:06,514
the quality of the distance education.

94
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:13,389
Promoting a more engaged learning
experience for the remote learners.

95
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:18,689
Alright, now, continuous feedback
and learning loop, right?

96
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:21,479
So immediate personalized feedback.

97
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,679
This is very important, right?

98
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:28,649
it's not like a traditional way of
simple correctness evaluation, right?

99
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:33,289
I go give an assessment and I
get assessed on that particular

100
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:35,419
thing and then I get a score.

101
00:06:35,489 --> 00:06:37,609
This is the traditional
way of doing things, right?

102
00:06:37,609 --> 00:06:40,829
Now we are moving away from
that traditional concept of

103
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:42,489
simple correctness evaluation.

104
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:46,439
In this case, the system
provides a detailed insights.

105
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,909
helping learners understand
their mistakes and then correct

106
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:52,469
from their misconceptions.

107
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:58,559
This is immediate, and this is more
personalized for this particular learner,

108
00:06:58,579 --> 00:06:59,919
whoever is taking these assessments.

109
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,999
And now integration of feedback.

110
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:06,159
feedback dynamically adjust
the learning pathway.

111
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:13,059
So that way, we are introducing new
content where learners show readiness or

112
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:16,119
revisiting foundational topics as needed.

113
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:17,949
Now, feedback is dynamic.

114
00:07:18,859 --> 00:07:19,229
Okay?

115
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:24,729
Now, feedback is, and, the, basically
the, the feedback is dynamically

116
00:07:24,739 --> 00:07:27,399
adjusted for the learning pathway.

117
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:27,449
Okay?

118
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:32,359
And that when a new content is
introduced, the engagement from the

119
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:35,359
learners is actually improved as well.

120
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:37,979
Now, how this is going to impact?

121
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:42,439
Now, this approach fosters a greater
sense of ownership in learners.

122
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:47,989
This increases the motivation and
retention rates by, by ensuring they

123
00:07:47,989 --> 00:07:54,439
are actively involved and in the
learning, the enhanced learning process

124
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:56,729
is actually presented to the user.

125
00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:02,239
What gamification, an important
concept in learning, gamification

126
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:07,709
improves motivation and then increases
the engagement, in learning any

127
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:09,439
new concepts for a learner, right?

128
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:15,919
And how does this work, for an RL based
reward system is dynamic reward mechanism.

129
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:18,949
They adapt to individual
learner preferences.

130
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:23,779
Utilizing badges, points, or
a virtual currency, for that

131
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:26,249
matter, to enhance the engagement.

132
00:08:26,749 --> 00:08:29,299
Now, motivation through
achievement unlocking.

133
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,739
How does this work?

134
00:08:30,749 --> 00:08:36,169
The reinforcement learning system
generates achievements tailored to

135
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:42,349
skill levels, ensuring that learners
remain challenged but not overwhelmed.

136
00:08:43,084 --> 00:08:45,384
Promoting a sustained engagement.

137
00:08:46,044 --> 00:08:50,544
Usually, it's things go ahead, it, things
could be overwhelming for the learners

138
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:55,384
when, a more complex scenario is produced
when they are, is presented to them.

139
00:08:55,664 --> 00:08:59,284
when the learner is not even
ready to actually take up

140
00:08:59,284 --> 00:09:00,854
that more complex scenario.

141
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:05,894
But in this case, this is a sustained
engagement wherein the progression

142
00:09:05,914 --> 00:09:11,554
happens as per the learner's
involvement and as per the engagement

143
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:17,454
and the way they are actually, the
learning process is progressing.

144
00:09:18,314 --> 00:09:21,454
So let's take a case study, right?

145
00:09:21,504 --> 00:09:25,044
for example, In a language learning
platform, the reinforcement learning

146
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:31,294
system identifies high engagement with
speaking exercises and then combines

147
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:37,354
and incentivizes writing tasks to create
a balanced skill, between, for the

148
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:40,224
speaking and the writing tasks, right?

149
00:09:40,724 --> 00:09:45,074
Moving on, predictive learning
and assessments, right?

150
00:09:45,574 --> 00:09:47,454
Anticipatory skill development.

151
00:09:48,174 --> 00:09:52,724
analyzing the historical data and
industry trends, RL systems can

152
00:09:52,734 --> 00:09:59,604
predict what skills are necessary for
the future success of this learner.

153
00:09:59,924 --> 00:10:04,244
Now, RL systems, they
become the guiding factor.

154
00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:08,414
They guide the learners to
proactive skill acquisition, right?

155
00:10:08,534 --> 00:10:11,444
Basically, it's a, it's adapting.

156
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:18,129
The new learning paths and enhancing
that learning path to make it better,

157
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:22,139
to make the learner successful
for the future engagements.

158
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,179
And then proactive curriculum planning.

159
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,744
In this case, the system
modifies learning paths.

160
00:10:30,024 --> 00:10:34,454
to introduce relevant topics in alignments
with predicted future needs, right?

161
00:10:35,264 --> 00:10:40,214
this ensures the learners are well
equipped for evolving job markets.

162
00:10:40,714 --> 00:10:44,864
And then, we have long term
trajectory optimization, right?

163
00:10:44,934 --> 00:10:50,824
RL algorithms model complex interactions
between different skills and facilitating

164
00:10:50,824 --> 00:10:56,124
pathways that promote comprehensive
competency development over time.

165
00:10:56,624 --> 00:11:00,904
With this, we come to the
conclusion and future directions.

166
00:11:01,404 --> 00:11:06,864
To summarize it, the integration of
reinforcement learning in AI driven

167
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:13,354
assessments is going to reshape
the educational landscape, offering

168
00:11:13,384 --> 00:11:18,954
personalized and adaptive learning
experiences that significantly

169
00:11:18,954 --> 00:11:20,664
enhance engagement and outcomes.

170
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:22,144
challenges ahead.

171
00:11:22,644 --> 00:11:26,424
We need to address the algorithm bias
is, addressing the algorithm bias is

172
00:11:26,444 --> 00:11:32,024
crucial for the fairness and transparency
in educational technologies, and

173
00:11:32,114 --> 00:11:37,694
understanding the complexities of human
learning processes remains a challenge.

174
00:11:38,194 --> 00:11:39,144
future research.

175
00:11:40,094 --> 00:11:44,164
We need to continue the exploration
of, reinforcement learning capabilities

176
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:49,789
improvements in algorithm interpretability
and integrating reinforcement learning

177
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:53,519
with other AI technologies like
natural language processing will

178
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:56,139
further enhance educational system.

179
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,159
that concludes, this session.
