00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:01,860
Hello.

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:02,649
Hi everyone.

3
00:00:02,889 --> 00:00:04,180
I'm Shar Alala.

4
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,790
I'm super excited to be here at con 42.

5
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,270
Today I'm talking about something
I'm really passionate about

6
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,040
how AI is changing the game.

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,550
In Sari, we are moving from
just reacting to issues, to

8
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,930
predicting and preventing them.

9
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,960
It's going from putting fires out
to building systems that do not

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,280
catch fire in the first place.

11
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,380
Let's start with a quick introduction.

12
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:31,880
So AI driven SRE basically means using
machine learning and smart automation

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,830
in how we keep systems reliable instead
of just waiting on, waiting for alerts

14
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,680
to go off and scrambling to fix things.

15
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:45,410
AI help us spot the signs earlier
and the act before anything breaks.

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,940
It's a big shift in how we work and it's
already happening in a lot of teams.

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,685
Let's deep dive into AI driven SRE.

18
00:00:53,425 --> 00:00:55,434
So what exactly is AI driven?

19
00:00:55,434 --> 00:01:00,955
SRE, it's a mix of the usual SRE
stuff like monitoring, alerts,

20
00:01:00,955 --> 00:01:03,864
reliability, work over the years
that whatever that we are doing.

21
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:09,535
Plus in combination with machine
learning, ly detection and forecasting.

22
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:13,615
So the goal is to make systems
that are not just reactive,

23
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:15,175
but smarter and proactive.

24
00:01:15,245 --> 00:01:18,600
Your system says, Hey I've
seen this pattern before, and.

25
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,720
It usually means something
about to go wrong.

26
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,929
So then that means it is giving you a
heads up before users even notice them.

27
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,170
How do we enable this
proactive IT operations?

28
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:38,350
One of the biggest changes in ai with AI
in SREs, how we shift from reacting to

29
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,910
just preventing, instead of waiting for
an outage to hit and then jumping in.

30
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,455
Ai, let us cat.

31
00:01:44,965 --> 00:01:45,745
Act early.

32
00:01:47,035 --> 00:01:52,815
It's part signals and frames that would
take a human hours or days to even notice.

33
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:57,345
This means fewer surprises
and way fewer fire drills.

34
00:01:57,435 --> 00:01:57,915
Trust me.

35
00:01:59,115 --> 00:02:01,425
How do we enhance system reliability?

36
00:02:01,475 --> 00:02:03,305
How does this help with reliability?

37
00:02:03,635 --> 00:02:08,255
When you are catching issues earlier,
your systems stay up more, right?

38
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:14,015
That means less downtime, few angry
customers and happier team A, help

39
00:02:14,015 --> 00:02:18,995
us get more control over our systems
instead of just reacting to chaos.

40
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:23,425
And how do you optimize your
infrastructure maintenance?

41
00:02:23,605 --> 00:02:26,665
Here's where it gets really cool.

42
00:02:27,115 --> 00:02:28,705
AI can also tell you.

43
00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:33,875
When parts of your infrastructure are
starting to wear out, isn't that cool?

44
00:02:34,505 --> 00:02:37,955
Maybe a server is acting weird
or a disc is about to fail.

45
00:02:38,165 --> 00:02:39,035
Anything like that?

46
00:02:39,035 --> 00:02:42,785
It depends on organization to
organization or system to system.

47
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:49,345
AI looks at patterns in the data and
says, Hey something is off here so you

48
00:02:49,345 --> 00:02:53,935
can fix things before they even break
and schedule downtime when you want,

49
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:58,895
not when the system forces you to do
let's talk about reactive ops challenge.

50
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:02,645
Let's talk about the
struggle with reactive ops.

51
00:03:02,645 --> 00:03:07,345
First of all, because we all have been
here, like stuff's break out of nowhere.

52
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:09,385
Alerts do not make sense.

53
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,520
Root cause analysis takes forever.

54
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,560
And we are always playing catch up.

55
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:21,010
This way of working is really stressful,
tiring, and honestly it doesn't scale.

56
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,240
That's why AI driven SRE is
such a breath of fresh air.

57
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,050
So let's talk about an important factor,
which is AI powered anomaly detection.

58
00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:36,505
So one of the biggest thing
about AI is anomaly detection.

59
00:03:36,745 --> 00:03:39,555
It's like giving your system superpowers.

60
00:03:39,615 --> 00:03:44,565
It can watch thousands of metrics
and logs at once and instantly

61
00:03:44,565 --> 00:03:46,515
say, Hey something is off here.

62
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:52,895
Instead of hundreds of alerts, you just
get one clear signal and you can act fast

63
00:03:53,075 --> 00:03:55,505
often before anything actually breaks.

64
00:03:55,745 --> 00:03:58,165
Let's talk about predictive maintenance.

65
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,175
So what is predictive maintenance?

66
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,940
Predictive maintenance is another big win.

67
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,900
Think of it as your system knows
when something going to fail

68
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,420
based on history or behavior.

69
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,370
So instead of reacting after server
crashes, AI tells you before it

70
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,360
happens, you schedule a fix and
everything keeps running smoothly.

71
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:21,685
So predictive maintenance techniques.

72
00:04:21,685 --> 00:04:23,545
What are the maintenance techniques here?

73
00:04:23,815 --> 00:04:28,335
There are a bunch of techniques for this,
as I just spoke about anomaly detection

74
00:04:28,765 --> 00:04:33,625
remaining useful life estimation, like
basically how much longer something will

75
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,355
last and a condition based monitoring.

76
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:41,275
These are all to understand the
health of your system and actively,

77
00:04:41,905 --> 00:04:46,075
and one other important one is like
forecasting your infrastructure demand.

78
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,780
This part is super helpful too.

79
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:54,800
As I said, forecasting AI looks at
past usage, your traffic patterns,

80
00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:00,590
even seasonality like spikes during
holidays and helps you plan ahead so

81
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:06,020
you do not under provision and crash
or over provision or waste resources.

82
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:10,760
That way you'll be able to optimize
your uptown and reduce downturn.

83
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,750
So when you put all this together,
anomaly detection, predictive maintenance,

84
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,900
and forecasting, you get more uptime,
fewer outages, and smoother operations.

85
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:27,210
AI helps you run things bit better,
smarter, and with less stress.

86
00:05:27,425 --> 00:05:32,165
And your customers, obviously they
don't even know where that they were.

87
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:33,785
There was almost a problem.

88
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:37,595
So let's get into real world case studies.

89
00:05:37,655 --> 00:05:40,055
This isn't just theory,
it's already working.

90
00:05:40,445 --> 00:05:46,445
And I've seen companies use these tools
to catch weird behavior, early fix stuff.

91
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,760
Faster and seriously cut down on downtime.

92
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,690
AI helps teams collaborate
better and stay ahead of issues.

93
00:05:53,989 --> 00:05:57,650
Today I would like to walk you
through or discuss about a case

94
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,929
study in one of the leading tech
company where I worked with I.

95
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:06,169
Quick story at a tech
company I worked with.

96
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:08,990
We rolled out AI based SRE tools.

97
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,460
We trained models to spot problems
early, set up dashboards, and

98
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,500
gave the team way more visibility.

99
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,690
And that helped team a lot.

100
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:22,400
And guess what downtime dropped
by over 60% in eight months.

101
00:06:22,609 --> 00:06:24,409
The team had fewer late night.

102
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:27,084
Incidents and reliability showed up.

103
00:06:28,224 --> 00:06:33,834
Let, so this is I had, I just wanted to
discuss about that case study and let's

104
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:35,844
move on to the future of AI and sre.

105
00:06:36,084 --> 00:06:40,334
So what what's next for AI
and SE We are seeing faster.

106
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:44,189
Anomaly detection as we spoke
about, and better predictions

107
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:45,839
because of the anomaly detection.

108
00:06:46,049 --> 00:06:49,979
And you have a self-healing
infrastructure mechanism out there.

109
00:06:50,219 --> 00:06:53,399
And AI that helps us
meet SLS automatically.

110
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:57,029
So it's moving fast and it is
super exciting to be part of it.

111
00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:02,479
So finally to wrap up, AI
driven SRE is here and it's

112
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,489
changing how we do reliability.

113
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,089
It.

114
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:10,129
It helps us move from reacting to
prediction, from chaos to control.

115
00:07:10,369 --> 00:07:15,319
So if you are an SRE, an engineer or
just someone who wants fewer two pages,

116
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:17,239
this is the direction we are heading.

117
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:22,609
Thanks for watching again, and a huge
thanks to Con two for the platform.

118
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:28,009
And if you ever want to chat more about
this, feel free to reach out to me.

119
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:28,969
Thank you.
