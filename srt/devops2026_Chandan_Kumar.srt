1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,340
Speaker 8: Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:06,540
I'm excited to talk about one of the
biggest transformation that we all

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,940
are witnessing in our industry in
the DevOps and AI landscapes, which

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,149
is the shift to the subscription
based intelligent platforms.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:20,280
This shift is not just a technological, it
is fundamentally reshaping how we design,

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,580
deploy, scale, and deliver AI driven.

7
00:00:24,345 --> 00:00:26,265
Experiences today.

8
00:00:26,265 --> 00:00:31,575
I will walk you through the architectural,
the operations part, the ML ops

9
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:36,625
practices, customer value, and the
future direction of this space.

10
00:00:37,315 --> 00:00:38,815
So let's get started.

11
00:00:39,315 --> 00:00:40,935
The convergence revolution.

12
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:46,505
This slide highlights the three primarily
focused area of conversing, which is

13
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:52,644
reshaping our industry First, DevOps
and continuous delivery have become

14
00:00:52,644 --> 00:00:55,345
the backbone of modern software cycles.

15
00:00:55,675 --> 00:01:00,834
Secondly, the subscription economy
has elevated expectations of for

16
00:01:00,834 --> 00:01:02,394
ongoing improvements and value.

17
00:01:02,964 --> 00:01:05,274
And third, the AI itself only.

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:11,530
Thrives when it is continuously updating
and retain all three reinforces each

19
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,330
other, creating a new operating model
that companies are rapidly adopting to.

20
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,520
Next slide is the platform
architecture foundations.

21
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:26,960
As we all know, the a successful
AI subscription platform must rest

22
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,660
on the four strong fundamentals.

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,680
Which is cloud infrastructure,
model management, data

24
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,210
pipelines and service metering.

25
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,180
Robust data pipelines ensure high quality
data following through the systems.

26
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,320
A cloud infrastructure gives a scalable
compute for training and inference

27
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:51,300
model management provides worsening
rollbacks when it is needed, and

28
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,270
the audits and experimentations.

29
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,050
The metering is essential for
predictable billing and planning.

30
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:05,779
Without these four data platform, the
platform cannot scale sustainability.

31
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:10,670
The next one we will talk about
where DevOps meets ai, dim ops.

32
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,440
ML Ops extends DevOps by introducing
model validations, fairness checks,

33
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,060
and continuous model assessment.

34
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,900
Continuous integration.

35
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:25,200
CI must integrate not only code,
but also data and model artifacts.

36
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,680
Testing needs to be deeper, covering
edge cases, Anders scenarios.

37
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,580
Finally, deployment must be gradual
to maintain reliability and, canary

38
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,900
rollouts and automated rollbacks
are essential to mitigate the risk.

39
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,390
How we can ensure the AI system
performance AI performance can

40
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,055
degrade over time due to data
drift or a drift in concept.

41
00:02:54,555 --> 00:02:58,454
Data drift means the input
changes concept drift means

42
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,525
real world relationship changes.

43
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:05,894
Monitoring these coupled with proactive
alerting is critical for maintaining

44
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:09,015
trust and consistent user experience.

45
00:03:09,075 --> 00:03:13,275
This is where continuous
observability of AI pipelines

46
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:15,734
becomes a non-negotiable practices.

47
00:03:16,234 --> 00:03:19,295
Okay, so some thoughts on
continuous learning pipelines.

48
00:03:19,795 --> 00:03:24,954
Continuous learning pipeline ensures
that our model remain fresh and relevant.

49
00:03:25,765 --> 00:03:31,674
New data must be collected securely,
respecting privacy regulations,

50
00:03:32,174 --> 00:03:38,224
retaining schedules, retraining
schedules Must consider cost

51
00:03:38,224 --> 00:03:41,794
efficiency since training is expensive.

52
00:03:42,294 --> 00:03:46,464
So this cost efficiency becomes very
critical factor and the deployment cycles

53
00:03:46,464 --> 00:03:48,594
must be automated for seamless updates.

54
00:03:49,094 --> 00:03:54,854
And finally, this feedback, integration
feedback, human in the feedback loop.

55
00:03:55,575 --> 00:03:59,650
This is must be structured
to avoid reinforcing biases.

56
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,680
Some thoughts on data quality,
the foundation of AI reliability.

57
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:10,660
No matter how advanced our model is,
poor data will undermine everything.

58
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,140
So this slides emphasizes the importance
of validations, anomaly, finding

59
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,880
detections, and strong governance.

60
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,960
Stream processing allows us
to catch issues in real time.

61
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:28,600
And provenance tracking enables full
traceability, which is especially

62
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,300
important for regulated practices.

63
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,790
Now we will talk about
privacy and security measures.

64
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:42,140
As AI becomes more capable, it
also becomes a target differential.

65
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,670
Privacy ensures.

66
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,560
That individuals cannot
be reverse identified.

67
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,960
Great point.

68
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,350
Okay.

69
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,020
To consider.

70
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,640
And federated learning allows
training without moving data.

71
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:03,280
Very useful or very useful for healthcare,
financial services, or global enterprises.

72
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:10,200
Advers defenses protects against
deliberate manipulations of input.

73
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:13,195
Of or model extractions?

74
00:05:13,695 --> 00:05:14,415
Operational.

75
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,655
What are the operational challenges?

76
00:05:16,685 --> 00:05:18,365
When we are operating at scale?

77
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:18,785
Okay.

78
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,845
Primarily for cost management,
performance, debugging, team

79
00:05:21,845 --> 00:05:27,515
collaboration, capacity planning,
running AI at scale is, not easy task.

80
00:05:27,965 --> 00:05:35,085
Cost can rapidly increase and if
restraining is not optimized, debugging

81
00:05:35,205 --> 00:05:39,335
becomes very challenging due to
interconnected nature of data algorithm

82
00:05:39,335 --> 00:05:45,035
and infrastructure capacity planning
must balance training requirements

83
00:05:45,215 --> 00:05:50,795
with real time inference and teams
must collaborate very closely.

84
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:58,390
Data sciences, ML engineering, DevOps,
and domain partners are all a need shared.

85
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,120
They all need to share the
tools and the language.

86
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,820
So compliance and accountability.

87
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,770
As it grows, it becomes very critical.

88
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,381
Regulations evolving faster
than they were GDPR and CCPA.

89
00:06:12,995 --> 00:06:18,415
Is this requires a strong data management
practices algorithm transparency.

90
00:06:18,415 --> 00:06:22,195
What it means that, especially it
is very important industry where AI

91
00:06:22,195 --> 00:06:25,195
decision impact people, id people lives.

92
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:29,155
Machine unlearning is
an emerging requirement.

93
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:34,825
Removing specific data influences
from train models and audit

94
00:06:34,825 --> 00:06:39,085
trails ensure traceability for
legal and operational reviews.

95
00:06:39,585 --> 00:06:44,055
What are the customer success
strategies, which we need to follow?

96
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:48,205
For the AI subscriptions
platforms, customer success is

97
00:06:48,205 --> 00:06:51,415
directly tied to the value ations.

98
00:06:52,135 --> 00:06:56,345
We must translate technical
performance into business outcome.

99
00:06:56,985 --> 00:07:01,425
A strong onboarding experiences
ensures customer integrate the platform

100
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:04,155
smoothly, uses analytics, helps us.

101
00:07:05,115 --> 00:07:09,555
Understanding adoption, identify
frictions and productively reduce churn.

102
00:07:10,485 --> 00:07:14,475
This is where product engineering
and success team works together

103
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:17,895
to drive a miserable impact or
to bring a miserable impact.

104
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:24,795
So few examples of industry applications
where AI, sub AI subscription platform

105
00:07:24,795 --> 00:07:26,385
touches nearly every industry.

106
00:07:26,385 --> 00:07:28,725
A few examples are here in media.

107
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,430
They improve content
discovery part in retail.

108
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:37,230
They personalized what user wants
and how user's shopping experience

109
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,560
can be enhanced in healthcare.

110
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:44,940
They enable more accurate
diagnostic while navigating

111
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,370
regulations in financial services.

112
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,880
Very sensitive and if
not handled properly.

113
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:56,460
I mean there are a lot of, there are
big chances to like impact people

114
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:00,120
directly because this is storing
the financial data and the financial

115
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,920
services they drive the fraud, right?

116
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:06,000
With the fraud prevention, the
risk management, this variety

117
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,775
demonstrated the worst reality and the
necessity of scalable AI operations.

118
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:12,835
Market dynamics talks.

119
00:08:13,195 --> 00:08:18,355
What it means that we are seeing intensify
competitions across the AI ecosystems.

120
00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:24,325
Cloud providers leads infrastructure while
the startups excel in specialization.

121
00:08:24,985 --> 00:08:31,735
Pricing models continue to evolve towards
uses and outcome based like tiered

122
00:08:31,735 --> 00:08:33,265
subscription, which is fixed model.

123
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:39,430
We are also seeing market consolidations,
but vertical specialization

124
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,780
remains a strong advantage.

125
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:46,330
Open source accelerates innovation,
which we always need, but increase

126
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:52,240
operational complexity, which is why
many companies may choose managed

127
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,170
services over open source solutions.

128
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,680
So what is the future trends?

129
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,050
Where we are heading
towards future trends?

130
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,550
Talks about that next wave.

131
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:07,580
AI will be defined by autonomy, will
be defined by multimodality, how we

132
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:13,220
democrat democratize it, and how a
repo our design is responsible enough.

133
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,000
AI agents will increasingly
handle multi-step tasks.

134
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,400
Multi-model AI will unlock.

135
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,980
Richer understanding and a
generation across formats.

136
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,450
No code and automation will
empower non-technical users.

137
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,070
Good, great stuff.

138
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,780
And responsible AI will shift
from aspirations to mandatory

139
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,940
practice across industries.

140
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,155
So future trends looks very
encouraging and, it'll, okay.

141
00:09:41,155 --> 00:09:44,545
So how will navigate this
transformation journey?

142
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:49,015
To Succeed organization must balance
these five pillars, starting from

143
00:09:49,015 --> 00:09:53,695
strategic vision, organization, culture,
technical capabilities, continuous value

144
00:09:53,695 --> 00:09:55,135
delivery, and operational excellence.

145
00:09:55,635 --> 00:09:59,655
Strategic reasons, cultural readiness,
technical maturity, operational

146
00:09:59,655 --> 00:10:01,545
excellence, and continuous value delivery.

147
00:10:01,545 --> 00:10:05,205
These all shift to subscription
AI platforms fundamentally

148
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:08,985
changes how companies plans
execute and measure success.

149
00:10:09,945 --> 00:10:14,325
DevOps provides this velocity,
subscription provides the

150
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:16,335
incentive for long term value.

151
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:18,795
AI provides the intelligence.

152
00:10:19,695 --> 00:10:22,875
So if we navigate all these
five aspects carefully.

153
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:26,945
I guess the future, which
we are talking about future

154
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:29,075
trends is, seems a possibility.

155
00:10:29,705 --> 00:10:32,105
So this conclude my presentation.

156
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:33,755
Thank you all.

157
00:10:34,055 --> 00:10:39,895
I hope this gave you a clear understanding
of how AI subscription models and DevOps

158
00:10:39,925 --> 00:10:45,235
practices are converging to shape the
next decade of int intelligence systems.

159
00:10:45,475 --> 00:10:46,465
Was more thank you.
