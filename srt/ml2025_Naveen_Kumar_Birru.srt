00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,440
Hello, Griffin.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,850
I'm Navin Kumar Beru.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,080
I'm truly honored to be here
at conference 42 ML 2025.

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,920
Today's talk is going to be about
Beyond Perimeters, implementing

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,660
Zero Trust at Enterprise Scale.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,520
In this session, I want to go beyond
the hype and breakdown what Zero Trust

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,180
really means, why it is not just a
security password, but a fundamental

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,080
architectural shift that enterprises
need to survive and thrive in today's

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,880
cloud driven distributed world.

10
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,300
Zero Trust has become one of the
most important strategies for

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,260
modern enterprises, especially
those operating across multi-cloud

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,980
environments, different geographies,
and supporting remote workforces.

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,850
In this presentation, I will walk
you through key concepts, shared

14
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,420
data points, and highlight real world
implementation challenges and outcomes.

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,105
Thank you for spending time with me.

16
00:00:47,355 --> 00:00:48,065
Let's get started.

17
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,005
Evolving digital landscape.

18
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:55,065
Let's begin by painting the
landscape we are operating in today.

19
00:00:55,065 --> 00:00:59,835
76% of enterprises run multi-cloud
environments spanning across average

20
00:00:59,835 --> 00:01:04,275
3.7 cloud providers, creating a
highly complex, interconnected system.

21
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:09,465
Despite investments and tenter
defense, 95% of reaches still result

22
00:01:09,465 --> 00:01:14,055
from human error, phishing attacks,
misconfigurations accidental exposure.

23
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,330
Breach costs are in class now,
averaging around 4.8 million

24
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,300
10.7 increase from last year.

25
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,110
These trends show that traditional
perimeter based defenses are

26
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:28,440
no longer enough to effectively
protect modern enterprises.

27
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,960
We need a model that assumes breaches
will happen and focus minimizing impact

28
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,630
the business case for zero trust.

29
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,280
So why zero trust.

30
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,020
Because organizations that embrace
mature zero trust programs save around

31
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,140
1.4 million on an average for breach.

32
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,370
Adoption has skyrocketed 49%
of enterprise support progress

33
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:54,020
and zero trust initiatives up
from 21% just a few years ago.

34
00:01:54,635 --> 00:01:58,505
This shift is practically driven by
remote work, which has expanded attack

35
00:01:58,505 --> 00:02:03,185
services by 37%, adding, unmanaged
devices, unsecured networks, and external

36
00:02:04,085 --> 00:02:08,705
access funds Beyond security, zero
trust offers business benefits like

37
00:02:08,705 --> 00:02:13,955
greater rigidity, safer cloud adoption,
and stronger regulatory realignment.

38
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:16,445
I think it's an essential for business.

39
00:02:17,735 --> 00:02:18,365
From perimeter to zero trust.

40
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,830
Zero trust requests a
fundamental mind shift.

41
00:02:22,385 --> 00:02:25,385
Instead of assuming that everything
inside the network is trusted,

42
00:02:25,385 --> 00:02:26,765
we follow three principles.

43
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,205
Continuous verification.

44
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:29,945
Every request is checked every time.

45
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:34,175
Identity based trust s are based
on identity, not on location.

46
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:35,825
No default trust.

47
00:02:35,915 --> 00:02:37,955
Nothing is implicitly trusted.

48
00:02:38,345 --> 00:02:42,215
Even inside the network, this shift
matters because 70% of today's

49
00:02:42,215 --> 00:02:46,565
traffic moves from east West,
inside the perimeter, the Old

50
00:02:46,565 --> 00:02:50,525
Castle and motor approach leaves
too many gaps open with zero trust.

51
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,770
The trust becomes something you
earn, not something you inherit.

52
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,460
Identity centric security identity is
the heart of zero trust in this model.

53
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,930
Identity becomes a new perimeter, whether
it's a person, device, or a workload.

54
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,040
According to Nest.

55
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,580
All resource authentications and
authorizations are dynamic and strictly

56
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,320
enforced before access is allowed.

57
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,790
But this is challenging.

58
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:19,160
92% of enterprises use multiple identity
systems, making it inconsistent and hard.

59
00:03:20,045 --> 00:03:23,645
Implementing leading implementations
now adopt continuous authentications,

60
00:03:23,675 --> 00:03:28,115
checking identity at multiple points
during a session, not just at the login.

61
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:33,155
This has resulted in 37% reduction
in identity based compromises

62
00:03:33,485 --> 00:03:37,385
proving the power of strong
identity centered defenses.

63
00:03:37,655 --> 00:03:41,945
In short, identity management becomes
the foundation for all security layers.

64
00:03:43,235 --> 00:03:47,430
Micro segmentation is another key zero
trust complement rather than managing.

65
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,020
Network zones, you apply granular control.

66
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:56,420
At workload level, 76% of enterprises now
implement software defined segmentation,

67
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,390
which controls ease to best traffic.

68
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,140
By ensuring that only explicit
allowed services communicate,

69
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,020
you reduce the breach by 66%.

70
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,290
In segmented environments,
micro-segmentation effectively

71
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,640
limits lateral movement, turning what
could have been a system-wide breach

72
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,110
into a small contained incident.

73
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,830
It reinforces the principle of
least coverage at the network level.

74
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,230
Cutting off attack
pathways before the spread.

75
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,970
Contextual access policies, dynamic
access policies are central to zero trust.

76
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,390
They rely on combining
multiple factors such as user

77
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,010
identity and behavior patterns.

78
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:37,200
Device health assessed by 83% of
enterprises request context like

79
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,900
locational time data sensitivity.

80
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,275
Ensuring sensitive resources
get extra protection.

81
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:49,155
By layering this control organizations
create adaptive risk of access decisions.

82
00:04:49,575 --> 00:04:55,155
The result, 37% of infiltrate
exfiltration incidents showing that

83
00:04:55,665 --> 00:04:57,435
smart policies make a real impact.

84
00:04:57,525 --> 00:05:00,765
This isn't just a static role
based access, but it's a applying

85
00:05:00,765 --> 00:05:02,340
context over every decision.

86
00:05:04,365 --> 00:05:08,445
Again, dynamic policy and enforcement
is central to zero trust implementation.

87
00:05:08,505 --> 00:05:13,575
Witness defining a core tenant that
access to resources is determined by

88
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:19,005
dynamic policy, including the observable
state of client identity, application,

89
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:20,530
service, and requesting asset.

90
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,860
The result is that zero
trust, security effectiveness.

91
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:29,425
Increases in lot of areas, reduction
in exploitable attacks at first by

92
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:36,955
41% reduction in breach scope based of
microsegmentation by 66% reduction in data

93
00:05:36,985 --> 00:05:42,655
filtration instance by 37%, and reducing
identity based compromise instance by 37%.

94
00:05:44,305 --> 00:05:46,255
Current state of zero trust adoption.

95
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:49,795
Let's look where most
organizations are today.

96
00:05:50,245 --> 00:05:50,395
Oh.

97
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:55,015
Only 8% have fully implemented zero
trust across their enterprises.

98
00:05:55,945 --> 00:05:58,555
But for others, the pro
process is under the way.

99
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:05,065
NI 90, sorry, 49% are actively applying
zero trust and key areas, and 34%

100
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,355
are still planning their approach.

101
00:06:06,745 --> 00:06:09,925
This highlights the implementation
gap between early pilots and

102
00:06:09,925 --> 00:06:11,275
fully enterprise coverage.

103
00:06:11,785 --> 00:06:13,375
Zero trust takes time.

104
00:06:13,465 --> 00:06:14,995
It's not a plug and play solution.

105
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:18,445
It requires careful strategy,
phase rollout, and alignment

106
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:19,465
across various teams.

107
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,890
Federated identity management.

108
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,960
Managing identities across a large,
complex organization is one of the

109
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:33,000
hardest zero trust challenges, mainly
because identity, confidence gap.

110
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,170
Only 29% of the organizations are
already confident in their identity

111
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:41,250
security controls creating a significant
challenges for zero trust implementations.

112
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:47,370
Privileged IDENT Identity Management
is 57% of the organizations Report U

113
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,570
using privileged identity management
and solutions as a part of the Zero

114
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,790
Trust approach machine identity.

115
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:59,400
73% of the organizations report
managing more machine identities that

116
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,810
humans human identifies, creating an
expanded identity surface requiring

117
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,190
consistent security controls.

118
00:07:05,655 --> 00:07:09,435
Large organizations must, I must
implement, it must implement

119
00:07:09,435 --> 00:07:13,245
federated identity solutions
that provide seamless, yet secure

120
00:07:13,605 --> 00:07:15,405
across distributed environments.

121
00:07:15,795 --> 00:07:19,125
The identity confidence gap
creates significant challenge

122
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:23,985
as 89% of organizations have
experienced at least one identity

123
00:07:24,465 --> 00:07:26,205
related breach in recent years.

124
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,810
End-to-end encryption, zero.

125
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,780
Trust demands persuasive
encryption, protecting data

126
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,130
no matter where it travels.

127
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:40,420
This includes encrypting data
transit data trust, securing a PA

128
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,320
communications, protecting EastWest
microservice traffic, and implementing

129
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,780
robust key management practices.

130
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,790
Zero trust requires encryption to
protect data throughout its life cycle,

131
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,630
emulating implicit trust in network
boundaries or transport mechanisms.

132
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,910
Research shows encryption is one
of the fourth most common controls

133
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,280
supporting zero trust initiatives.

134
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:08,200
This shift reduces reliance on network
boundaries and ensures that even

135
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,850
intercepted data remains producted.

136
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:15,820
It's about making sure that data
sensitive information is always secure,

137
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:22,270
and even on unru channels distributed
policy enforcement, zero trust requests.

138
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,630
Enforcing policies consistently
at multiple levels.

139
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:30,969
Network layer, the secure gateways with
secure gateways and next gen firewalls.

140
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:36,220
57% of organizations imple implement
secure gateways as a part of the zero

141
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:41,620
trust policy proving foundational
security through next generation

142
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,690
firewalls and secure access
through SAS E Solutions service.

143
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:50,560
Meh layer using MTLS
and fine game controls.

144
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:57,724
Finding control policy in a containerized
environment enables zero trust principles

145
00:08:57,874 --> 00:09:01,684
to modern application architectures
with service to service communication.

146
00:09:02,344 --> 00:09:08,854
Securing the MTLS communication between
each service application layer, applying

147
00:09:08,854 --> 00:09:14,044
rules through a PA gateway degrees, that
all a PA access and others to zero trust

148
00:09:14,044 --> 00:09:18,454
policies with comprehensive authentication
authorization for each request.

149
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:23,165
Policy enforcement must occur at
multiple layers within the technology

150
00:09:23,165 --> 00:09:26,884
stack to implement zero trust principles
effectively at enterprise scale.

151
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:31,025
This architectural approach to
policy improvement returns a

152
00:09:31,025 --> 00:09:35,045
critical success factor with 70%
of the organizations reporting

153
00:09:35,045 --> 00:09:37,925
through difficulty and incorporating
consistent policy enforcement

154
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:39,545
during distributed environments.

155
00:09:40,025 --> 00:09:43,594
Without uniform policy informants
gaps appear and attackers look

156
00:09:43,594 --> 00:09:44,974
for those inconsistencies.

157
00:09:45,604 --> 00:09:48,424
Effective policy enforcement
is not just about tools.

158
00:09:48,424 --> 00:09:51,304
It's about ensuring alignment
across technology stack.

159
00:09:54,244 --> 00:09:57,944
Comprehensive observability is
true backbone of a successful

160
00:09:58,005 --> 00:09:59,265
zero trust implementation.

161
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,625
Without it, you are operating
blind and in today's fast moving

162
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,305
environment, there's a risk.

163
00:10:04,755 --> 00:10:06,974
No op, no organization can afford.

164
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:10,365
To succeed, you need a visibility
across entire stack from

165
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:13,814
infrastructure to application,
from network to user behavior.

166
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:17,115
This means that you're not just collecting
raw data, but you're turning it into

167
00:10:17,145 --> 00:10:19,725
meaningful insights that can drive action.

168
00:10:20,355 --> 00:10:23,565
Key components include secure
event collection across all

169
00:10:23,565 --> 00:10:27,825
the systems, cloud and on-prem,
comprehensive visibility enabling

170
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:31,755
both proactive threat identification
and effective incident response.

171
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:38,310
Behavioral analysis to establish baseline
studies and quick, quickly identify

172
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:43,110
unusual patterns, establish baseline
behaviors and identify deviations that

173
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:49,580
may indicate security threats of automated
responses that contain threats, the the

174
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,205
moment they're detected, enabling rapid
mitigation of potential threats before

175
00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:55,965
they can cause significant damage.

176
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:00,650
Cons, consistent feedback loops
where real time data helps fine tune

177
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,600
policies and controls over time.

178
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,710
Leverage operational data towards
adjust security controls based

179
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,270
on environmental conditions.

180
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,040
Currently, 42% of the organization support
expanding their logging, monitoring, and

181
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,570
telemetry efforts as a part of the zero
trust journey, but achieving comprehensive

182
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,790
observability about more than just tools.

183
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:23,360
It's about designing the systems
that integrate visibility, nativity,

184
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,640
and not an after that a thought.

185
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,850
Remember, you cannot
secure what you cannot see.

186
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,110
Zero trust requires full situational
awareness across systems,

187
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,030
identities, devices, and networks.

188
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,180
The more you know about the
environment, the faster, the more

189
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,860
precise, precisely you can act.

190
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,410
When something goes wrong.

191
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:45,365
Ultimately, I've done zero trust, zero
trust from a static policy framework

192
00:11:45,425 --> 00:11:47,765
into a living adaptive security posture.

193
00:11:48,765 --> 00:11:50,565
Let's talk about service mis integration.

194
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,345
When we talk about S securing Cloud
native application service me, service

195
00:11:56,345 --> 00:12:01,745
meshes like STO Linkerd or a WS app
mesh become central to zero trust.

196
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:03,755
They aren't just networking tools.

197
00:12:03,815 --> 00:12:07,265
They're embedded deeply into
how microservice communicate

198
00:12:07,265 --> 00:12:08,675
to communicate with each other.

199
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:15,245
Serviceness provide critical capabilities
including MTLS, mutual TLS, ensuring that

200
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:18,785
every service to service inter interaction
is authenticated and encrypted.

201
00:12:19,235 --> 00:12:22,685
All service to service communication
is authenticated and encrypted.

202
00:12:23,465 --> 00:12:27,425
Explicit access policies defining
exactly which services are

203
00:12:27,425 --> 00:12:29,015
allowed to talk to each other.

204
00:12:29,255 --> 00:12:31,865
Can make zero trust, easy to implement.

205
00:12:32,165 --> 00:12:35,855
Services can only communicate with
explicit authorized endpoints.

206
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:41,015
Telemetry collection is another important
feature of zero miss integration,

207
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:48,685
gathering rich telemetry data on
communication patterns, errors, latency

208
00:12:48,925 --> 00:12:51,415
is critical for telemetric collections.

209
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:55,140
Detailed metrics on communication patterns
reveals potential security anomalies.

210
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,700
Cryptographic workload identities.

211
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,020
This gives services unique
verifiable identities that are hard

212
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:06,690
topo cryptographic identities for
services that can easily be spoofed.

213
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,370
By integrating these features
directly into the application layer,

214
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:16,180
organizations can and for zero trust
at a granular service level, service

215
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,860
to service level communications.

216
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:20,605
This reduces the risk of lateral movement.

217
00:13:20,695 --> 00:13:22,975
Even if one part of the system
is compromised, the other

218
00:13:22,975 --> 00:13:24,835
parts stay minimal impact.

219
00:13:25,465 --> 00:13:29,035
It also provides better visibility
on how applications behave, enabling

220
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:33,020
tighter controls and faster detection
of anomalies without the service mass.

221
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:37,345
Mass integration, zero trust efforts
and mic Microsoft microservice

222
00:13:37,345 --> 00:13:41,035
and environments often fall short,
leaving gap for attackers that GA,

223
00:13:41,065 --> 00:13:43,825
that possibly could be exploited.

224
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:49,090
Think of a service mesh as a connective
tissue that holds zero trust principles

225
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,280
and high dynamic cloud architectures.

226
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,850
It's not about improving security,
it's about building resilience,

227
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,700
scalability, and adaptability
into the heart of the system.

228
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,800
Service mesh like.

229
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,380
SST O like we talked about, linker.

230
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:07,720
DAWS mesh ate zero trust by providing
critical security capabilities for

231
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,760
containerized microservice environment.

232
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,865
Service mesh provide critical capabilities
for implementing zero trust and micro

233
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,765
microservice environment by creating
an architecture by securities embedded

234
00:14:18,855 --> 00:14:20,295
within the application infrastructure.

235
00:14:21,465 --> 00:14:23,835
Now let's talk about a p
security and zero trust.

236
00:14:23,955 --> 00:14:26,535
APIs are front doors to
modern applications and

237
00:14:26,535 --> 00:14:27,580
they're under concentrate.

238
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:33,405
A zero trust framework, API security must
be treated as a first class citizen and

239
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,205
first class priority, not an afterthought.

240
00:14:36,445 --> 00:14:40,745
Securing API involves several key
practices deploying API gateway as a

241
00:14:40,745 --> 00:14:46,275
centralized centralized enforcement points
for all incoming and outgoing, a PA calls.

242
00:14:46,695 --> 00:14:48,825
This helps in centralized
enforcement points.

243
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,100
For applying security policies,
implementing authentication requirements

244
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:57,280
for all, a PA consumer, regardless
of their network origin, applying

245
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,600
rate limit, and anomaly detection
to prevent abuse, denial of service

246
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,880
attacks, or unexpected spikes.

247
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,090
Protecting against this abuse
is critical for zero trust.

248
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,920
Forcing schema validation to block
malformed and malicious payloads that

249
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,300
could exploit the backend system.

250
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,960
This prevents, this is critical in
preventing controls, ensuring that

251
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,980
all data passed through a PA others
to expected format, preventing common

252
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,020
attack techniques like injection attacks.

253
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,680
Zero trust for API
becomes, goes even further.

254
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:30,280
It means authenticating every API
consumer validating authorization

255
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,180
for every action and continuously
monitoring for suspicious behaviors.

256
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,530
A PA often connect to sensitive data,
financial transactions, or critical

257
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:43,480
operations, making them prime target
for attackers Without strong a PA

258
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,560
security, even most well-designed zero
trust architectures can be bypassed.

259
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,480
Additionally, as organizations and entries
open ecosystems working with partners,

260
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,400
vendors, and third parties, API Security
becomes a vital piece of maintaining

261
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,710
trust across extended supply chains.

262
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:05,620
Zero Trust can be applied to APIs to
ensure that every single request is

263
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:10,720
evaluated, verified, and ultimately,
your zero trust strategy is only

264
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,310
as strong as your weakest a PA.

265
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,600
Now, let's talk about how to
overcome implementation challenge.

266
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,190
We can't talk about zero trust
without addressing its challenges.

267
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,810
Adoption is really smooth
and organizations fail and

268
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,430
face real practical hurdles.

269
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:31,500
About 60% of security leaders point to
legacy system compatibility as one of the

270
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,160
biggest obstacles for zero trust policy.

271
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,780
Older systems weren't designed for
continuous verification or granular

272
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,440
access control and retrofitting them
can be expensive and time consuming.

273
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:44,850
These.

274
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,260
These are also challenges with
other tools like sprawl, skill gaps.

275
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,860
There are also challenges with
skill gaps, cultural resistance,

276
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,360
and also alignment across teams.

277
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,620
State of trust isn't just a security
project, it's a organizational

278
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,560
transformation that requires
buy-in from leadership, IP

279
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,030
operations, and business units.

280
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,040
Successful organizations approach zero
trust as a structured and stage journey.

281
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,350
They start by identifying high value
targets, applying zero trust policies.

282
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,700
Where they can and applying zero trust
principles where they can have biggest

283
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:24,160
impact, and then gradually expanding
the output help build momentum.

284
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,240
But strong, long-term success
requires sustained investment and

285
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,740
cross-functional collaboration.

286
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,490
The transformation of zero trust
architecture presents numerous

287
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,210
implementation challenges that
organizations must systematically address.

288
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:42,775
Approximately 60% of the security
professional site legacy systems as that

289
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:48,595
main concern by decoupling identity from
network location, implementing rigorous

290
00:17:48,595 --> 00:17:51,955
authentication and authorization, and
maintaining continuous verification

291
00:17:52,015 --> 00:17:56,815
organization can build resilient security
framework that adapt to realities

292
00:17:56,935 --> 00:17:58,705
of modern distributed enterprises.

293
00:17:58,705 --> 00:18:03,265
It's important to remember that
zero trust isn't a product you

294
00:18:03,265 --> 00:18:04,825
buy your checkbox, you complete.

295
00:18:05,005 --> 00:18:08,305
It's a shift in how organization
thinks about trust, access,

296
00:18:08,305 --> 00:18:13,135
risk, and a mindset that puts
continuous verification at its core.

297
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:18,355
At the end, organizations are
that succeed of those that see

298
00:18:19,075 --> 00:18:22,895
zero zero trust as a strategic
commitment, not as a tactical fix.

299
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,420
In closing, thank you all so
much for joining me today.

300
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,880
I hope the stock gave you a
clear understanding on how zero

301
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,860
trust cancer enterprise security
and give you a realistic sense

302
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,120
of what it takes to get there.

303
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,750
If you'd like to connect and share
insights or continue this conversation,

304
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,250
I would love to hear back from you.

305
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,870
Thank you again and enjoy the
rest of conference 42 ml 2025.
