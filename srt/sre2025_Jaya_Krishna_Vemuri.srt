1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,570
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,370
Hope everyone is doing great.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,840
I'm Ja Krishna having more than 14
years of experience in IT industry

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,890
in implementing the high volume, high
performance, large scale investment

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:18,670
products using databases like Oracle
Cyber, snowflake Cloud, stuff like Azure.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,640
A-W-S-D-V-T have a strong expertise
in front back trading applications on.

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,700
How they work, how users performs
their reconciliation process for

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,260
the regulatory and reporting needs.

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,930
As part of my job responsibilities,
I was primarily involved in building

10
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:42,130
up multiple application using on-prem
and hybrid and cloud technologies

11
00:00:42,145 --> 00:00:43,745
with very strong domain knowledge.

12
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:45,945
Today we're gonna talk.

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,370
Cloud-based reconciliation
system and investment banking.

14
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,830
Let's get into that.

15
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,320
So the investment banking
industry operates on very massive

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,849
scale of data processing like
millions of transactions daily.

17
00:01:02,849 --> 00:01:05,895
I. Accurate and timely
consideration of financial data

18
00:01:05,895 --> 00:01:10,035
is essential for compliance, risk
management, and decision making.

19
00:01:11,025 --> 00:01:14,595
This presentation will explore the
transmitted power of cloud-based

20
00:01:14,595 --> 00:01:17,835
reconciliation applications
and the impact in the industry.

21
00:01:19,815 --> 00:01:23,775
First, I wanted to just say few
challenges about the traditional

22
00:01:23,775 --> 00:01:25,065
reconciliation process.

23
00:01:25,425 --> 00:01:29,175
So traditional reconciliation
process is time consuming where

24
00:01:29,835 --> 00:01:31,365
there's so much of manual effort.

25
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,290
While performing data analysis,
preparation of sheets, initiating

26
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,310
the data, and then performing
that matching of the transaction.

27
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,970
And I, in fact, the dispen and
preparation of reports, everything

28
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:48,970
is time consuming because most of the
things are manual and this can lead to.

29
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,330
In closing the periods,
one is human error.

30
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:57,050
Any kind of manual intervention
increases the scope of error like

31
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,070
data entry, mistakes missing some
transaction, incorrect data matching.

32
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,520
These error can result in
discrepancies and potential.

33
00:02:06,515 --> 00:02:09,139
To inaccurate financial statements.

34
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:15,769
Next, this joint systems legacy
systems often work in isolation where

35
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,670
different departments or outside
partners use separate softwares.

36
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,615
This fragmentation makes it difficult
to get unified view of financial data.

37
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,860
And delayed information.

38
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:32,990
Legacy reconciliation process mostly
operates on batching of the data

39
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:38,150
updates, which means financial data
is not real time, which results

40
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,560
in not making decisions on time
without, and they have to perform

41
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,610
the reconciliation without data.

42
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:46,835
Information and difficulty in audits.

43
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:51,785
With all these problems like daily
data, human errors, design systems

44
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:57,395
there is more chances of failing
in audits, which again redo all the

45
00:02:57,395 --> 00:02:59,405
process, filling kids a course time.

46
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:04,445
So this is the current challenges which
currently legacy systems are facing.

47
00:03:05,195 --> 00:03:07,985
So I'm gonna talk key features
of the modern reconciliation.

48
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:10,325
One is automated data matching.

49
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:14,255
The cloud-based platforms automate
the process of matching transactions

50
00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:18,485
from multiple sources such as banks,
counterpart, custodians, trend,

51
00:03:18,935 --> 00:03:21,470
tradition, and some trading platforms.

52
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:22,445
The system.

53
00:03:23,505 --> 00:03:27,675
Internal records with external records
like ledge systems and bank systems,

54
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:32,925
some statements and it flags any
kind of expenses for further review.

55
00:03:33,315 --> 00:03:36,975
By setting up some rules and
real time data synchronization,

56
00:03:37,035 --> 00:03:38,144
cloud technology allows.

57
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:42,065
Data to be seen and updated in real time.

58
00:03:42,575 --> 00:03:45,605
This means that as invent transaction
hackers, they're immediately

59
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:50,225
reconciled with the corresponding
records from other systems or tions.

60
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:55,625
It significantly speed up the
reconci concession process and

61
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,455
integration with multiple systems.

62
00:03:59,135 --> 00:04:03,575
So cloud-based reconciliation platform
can seamlessly integrate with various

63
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:05,255
internal and external systems.

64
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:09,095
Such as, so systems accounting,
softwares, custodian devices,

65
00:04:09,695 --> 00:04:13,355
which provides a unified view of
financial transactions at one place.

66
00:04:14,585 --> 00:04:18,304
And finally, reporting analytics.

67
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:21,394
Cloud-based systems typically
have powerful reporting tools

68
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,015
and analytical capabilities.

69
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,914
These tools allow forms to generate
comprehensive reports on their

70
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:32,825
reconciliation process and spot potential
issues early or very near real time.

71
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,830
These are few core components of
cloud-based reconciliation architecture,

72
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,350
which we can talk about now.

73
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,360
So one is data addition layer.

74
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:49,270
The system employs advanced APIs and
connectors to ingested data from multiple

75
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,520
sources, including trade confirmation,
settling, transaction, and market data.

76
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,430
Ted, the next.

77
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,710
Step is transformation engine.

78
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,850
So this ETL process standardize,
andries the ingested data

79
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,410
through automated workflows.

80
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,170
And once the data has been transformed,
as per the business needs, the

81
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,770
reconciliation engine kicks off with
high performance matching engine

82
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:17,065
employees, the configurable rules
and algorithms to perform multi

83
00:05:17,065 --> 00:05:18,945
reconciliation across the data sources.

84
00:05:19,815 --> 00:05:22,400
Once the reconciliation
engine finishes his.

85
00:05:22,985 --> 00:05:27,635
Reconciliation process that the final
step is reporting and analytics.

86
00:05:28,055 --> 00:05:31,895
The reporting layer leverages the
business intelligence capabilities to

87
00:05:31,895 --> 00:05:34,985
generate real time dashboards, regulated
reports, and predictive analytics

88
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:37,205
that drives operational improvements.

89
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,320
So these are some technical
features and performance mat

90
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,990
metrics, which we came across.

91
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:54,550
So when we implement past three years on
before implementation, what was our thing?

92
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:59,005
And after implementation of cloud-based
reconciliation what was our metrics.

93
00:05:59,335 --> 00:06:04,675
So it, it includes three
years exception handling time.

94
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:10,805
Which came down from th around
360 minutes, which is six,

95
00:06:11,495 --> 00:06:14,075
six hours to 18 minutes.

96
00:06:14,345 --> 00:06:18,545
So we can see the improvement and
automatic batch rate, system availability.

97
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,235
We know that cloud system have.

98
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:26,855
99.99% down to system availability
where we can have region specific

99
00:06:26,855 --> 00:06:30,935
SY systems configured and then
system up time, everything.

100
00:06:31,175 --> 00:06:36,335
It's that technical architecture
leverages microservices with so

101
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:40,835
many descriptive services, each
maintaining independent scaling

102
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:42,815
capabilities with guaranteed uptake.

103
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,475
And these are.

104
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:49,925
How the data quality.

105
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:55,335
Quality of data is really important in
any of these reconciliation systems.

106
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:57,575
How we perform the data quality over here.

107
00:06:57,905 --> 00:06:59,615
First you perform data validation.

108
00:06:59,975 --> 00:07:05,465
So new rule network based engines achieve
99.8% accuracy while processing, or

109
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,085
15 million transactions per second.

110
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:11,655
And then standardization, quantum
resistant encryption enabled

111
00:07:11,655 --> 00:07:13,515
secure standardization across.

112
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:18,765
300 plus different source
systems monitoring realtime

113
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:22,035
system detect lys with 99.95.

114
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:26,155
Nine six accuracy with
50 microseconds Adoption.

115
00:07:27,085 --> 00:07:30,715
Reinforcement learning reduces
implementation time from

116
00:07:30,805 --> 00:07:33,085
weeks to just four plus hours.

117
00:07:34,405 --> 00:07:39,045
The process automation segment in
financial reconciliation has grown.

118
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,870
So much between 21 to 23, reaching
market value of 89.5 billion.

119
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,075
These are some stats, which
we got it from multiple

120
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:52,615
systems

121
00:07:54,955 --> 00:07:56,735
and regulatory compliance and automation.

122
00:07:57,795 --> 00:08:02,205
Automated reporting processing over 5.2
million regulated reports daily across

123
00:08:02,505 --> 00:08:10,485
1 32 due with almost a hundred percent
accuracy, reducing complaints, relative

124
00:08:10,515 --> 00:08:16,100
operational cost with 78% documentation
management, advanced MI algorithms.

125
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:23,820
Process 12.3 petabytes of compliance
data daily with travel time, average

126
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,860
35 milliseconds and maintaining a
hundred percent accuracy and emissions.

127
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,160
So even if you see audit trials.

128
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:38,235
Our blockchain based systems enable
immutable record keeping of 15.7

129
00:08:38,235 --> 00:08:42,680
billion daily events with a guaranteed
detention period of 10 years.

130
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,365
Instant access for regulator inquiries.

131
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:51,335
So these are some more metrics about
scalability and performance capabilities

132
00:08:51,335 --> 00:08:53,375
in cloud-based reconciliation system.

133
00:08:53,795 --> 00:08:59,015
So at a peak we can get like 12.8
million transaction process per second

134
00:08:59,015 --> 00:09:04,865
during peak up peak covers where
so much data is being streaming.

135
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:08,795
And even during that time we have 99.9999.

136
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,410
Percent system up and more
than 5.4 million conent.

137
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:20,740
You just can, be supported across all
over the globe, which is 1 4, 7 countries.

138
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:27,340
And the system latency is like 12
milliseconds, maintained even at

139
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,080
25 million transactions per minute.

140
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:35,295
This modern installation platform utilizes
quantum inspired algorithms have achieved.

141
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,469
Super scalability.

142
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:42,250
Elastic computing resources
automatically provision across 27

143
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:48,760
global regions within 800 milliseconds
of detecting the demand spikes while

144
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,890
maintaining sub millisecond latency.

145
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:58,120
So when it comes to implementation,
operation considerations, so

146
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,795
when we use cloud infrastructure.

147
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:02,229
Almost ev.

148
00:10:02,859 --> 00:10:08,079
Almost every institution now is erupt
into the current cloud and then hybrid

149
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,310
multi-cloud strategy, and then user
training, 96% certification rate

150
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,870
within first quarter of the deployment.

151
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,630
Disaster query.

152
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,170
Active configuration across
five geographic regions.

153
00:10:21,785 --> 00:10:22,655
Support structure.

154
00:10:22,895 --> 00:10:27,335
A augmented systems resolve
92% of incidents automatically.

155
00:10:28,475 --> 00:10:28,775
Yeah.

156
00:10:28,865 --> 00:10:34,985
Financial organizations maintain
an average of 2,840 cloud native

157
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:38,795
application with reconciliation
platforms requiring integration across

158
00:10:40,565 --> 00:10:42,995
hundred and 67 different systems.

159
00:10:42,995 --> 00:10:46,155
And 89 external services delegate.

160
00:10:46,965 --> 00:10:53,065
18.5% of the Total IT budget for
the transformation initiatives

161
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:57,025
with change management programs
typically involves 1500 thousand

162
00:10:57,025 --> 00:10:58,675
end users across 45 countries.

163
00:11:00,115 --> 00:11:03,085
So let's think about
our future directions.

164
00:11:04,225 --> 00:11:06,010
Yay, artificial.

165
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,850
In the next generation, AI transforms.

166
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,740
Reconciliation through intelligent
pattern recognition methods

167
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,810
advanced a complex matching while.

168
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,600
Real time anomaly detection prevents
errors before the impact operations,

169
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,510
reducing manual intervention by up to 85%.

170
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,750
And then the blockchain technology
enhances financial reconciliation

171
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,180
by providing a decentralized ledger.

172
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,270
This increases transaction
