00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:00,720
Hi.

2
00:00:01,619 --> 00:00:01,840
Hi.

3
00:00:01,845 --> 00:00:02,764
I am Satish Gola.

4
00:00:02,764 --> 00:00:06,695
I bring over 17 years of IT experience
with nine plus years deeply focused

5
00:00:06,695 --> 00:00:11,135
on Vow vault implementations across
both commercial and r and d in the

6
00:00:11,135 --> 00:00:12,785
lifecycle life sciences industry.

7
00:00:13,205 --> 00:00:17,045
I have led global rollouts, legacy
migrations and automation initiatives

8
00:00:17,045 --> 00:00:20,735
that streamlined operations for top
pharma clients like Bristol and Mayor.

9
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:22,995
BMS and Pfizer.

10
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:27,375
Today I'm here to walk you through how
platform thinking combined with AI and

11
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:31,185
structured content is fundamentally
changing the way regulated submissions

12
00:00:31,185 --> 00:00:35,025
are delivered, especially in high
stake areas like rare diseases.

13
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:36,435
So let's dive in.

14
00:00:36,935 --> 00:00:40,655
Let's start with a problem on an average
bringing a therapy to market, which

15
00:00:40,655 --> 00:00:44,345
takes around several years, especially
more like 10 years, and shockingly,

16
00:00:44,855 --> 00:00:48,635
40% of the time is spent on managing
documentation, but not innovation.

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,135
So every day of delay means we are losing
close to one to 3 million every day.

18
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:58,090
And more importantly, patients are
waiting and a single clinical document

19
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,320
has to go through six to eight review
cycles and abortion conflicts, or

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,700
which are like constant pain point,
these inefficiencies at months and

21
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,220
sometimes years to the entire process.

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,550
Why the traditional approaches fail.

23
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,110
Today's regulatory and content process
are slowed down by paperwork, disconnected

24
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,760
systems, and lack of coordinations.

25
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,060
Teams in clinical, regulatory
and commercial areas often

26
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,900
work in an isolation, leading
miscommunication and repeated works.

27
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,740
Even a small content change can
trigger full re-approval cycles,

28
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,450
and within each country demand.

29
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,930
It has different localized documents,
things getting harder and harder.

30
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,260
Day by day, but there is a better way.

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,760
How can we make this better?

32
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,530
By connecting the platforms that unify
teams and tools and reusable content

33
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,580
blocks that adopt to different markets
without starting from sketch, and then

34
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,180
automated workflows that reduce back
and forth, speed up and approvals.

35
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,060
The opportunity is very clear.

36
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,740
We need to engineer efficiency.

37
00:01:56,145 --> 00:01:59,235
By moving static documents to
structured content platforms,

38
00:01:59,235 --> 00:02:00,675
we gain a massive speed.

39
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:04,695
This think reusable building
blocks, workflow automations,

40
00:02:04,695 --> 00:02:06,165
and global scalability.

41
00:02:06,645 --> 00:02:08,264
This is not digitalization.

42
00:02:08,264 --> 00:02:10,964
It's about transforming the
way the life sciences work.

43
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,764
Modern platforms like we all
are leading this transformation.

44
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:18,364
Contents content as component
means documentation can

45
00:02:18,364 --> 00:02:19,714
be reused across markets.

46
00:02:19,744 --> 00:02:21,999
Workflow automations allows
for parallel reviews and.

47
00:02:22,564 --> 00:02:27,394
Fast track approvals and the integration
layer connects clinical, regulatory

48
00:02:27,394 --> 00:02:31,184
safety and commercial functions
which is breaking many barriers.

49
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,064
What's the result?

50
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:36,314
It's like faster, more compliment,
compliant like it, it makes more

51
00:02:36,314 --> 00:02:37,934
the submissions more compliant.

52
00:02:38,434 --> 00:02:41,644
Let's talk about key technologies
driving this transformation.

53
00:02:42,084 --> 00:02:46,194
A powered quality checks, which spots
errors before they become any bottlenecks.

54
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:50,484
Cloud native collaboration allows global
teams to work on the same content in

55
00:02:50,484 --> 00:02:55,824
real time, and by integrating real world
data, documents can evolve dynamically

56
00:02:55,824 --> 00:02:58,794
as outcomes or any safety data changes.

57
00:02:59,154 --> 00:03:04,574
So all these technologies, they bring
both speed and precision during a global

58
00:03:04,574 --> 00:03:08,324
health emergency, which usually takes
six months, a regulatory submission

59
00:03:08,324 --> 00:03:09,884
was just completed in eight days.

60
00:03:09,884 --> 00:03:10,724
Can you believe this?

61
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:11,174
How?

62
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:15,989
Of pre-approved templates and then
parallel approval parallel workflow

63
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:21,479
workflows across 22 agencies, real-time
collaboration and automated localization.

64
00:03:21,809 --> 00:03:22,679
What's the end result?

65
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:26,939
Patients got an access to the
treatment five months sooner.

66
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,569
Which usually takes six months.

67
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:30,074
It was completed in eight days.

68
00:03:30,574 --> 00:03:34,024
We have a, another case study
for global launch efficiency.

69
00:03:34,474 --> 00:03:36,884
A mid-sized biopharma had a challenge.

70
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:40,124
Launching it in 18 markets
within a small regulatory team.

71
00:03:40,784 --> 00:03:44,594
With platform-based authoring,
reusable submission components and

72
00:03:44,594 --> 00:03:48,914
automated translations, the acute
simultaneous launches cutting the

73
00:03:48,914 --> 00:03:51,464
localization timelines by 40%.

74
00:03:51,984 --> 00:03:54,954
This is the impact, which
is now becoming the norm.

75
00:03:55,914 --> 00:03:57,444
Let's measure the business impact.

76
00:03:57,444 --> 00:03:58,884
Let's look at the numbers.

77
00:03:59,214 --> 00:04:03,774
So it's gonna be 50% faster document
lifecycles through smarter workflows.

78
00:04:04,764 --> 00:04:09,684
And then 40% of localization, which
enables multiple markets at once and

79
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:14,784
80, 85% fewer safety findings, which
improves the complaints and how,

80
00:04:14,784 --> 00:04:16,044
you know how much it's gonna save.

81
00:04:16,044 --> 00:04:20,454
It's gonna save close to 2.5
million per therapy and per day.

82
00:04:21,174 --> 00:04:22,374
These are not just stats.

83
00:04:22,404 --> 00:04:24,294
These this is a real ROI.

84
00:04:24,794 --> 00:04:25,784
So what's next?

85
00:04:26,114 --> 00:04:27,074
It's a, it's the future.

86
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:29,354
AI and regulatory intelligence
is gonna be the future.

87
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:33,039
A will power predictive
regulatory analysis.

88
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:37,299
It's gonna scan thousands of submissions
to guide strategy and it's gonna

89
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:42,099
automatically draft any structured data,
which is gonna save 60% of the authoring

90
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:47,589
time, and it's gonna perform the dynamic
risk assessments as well, adopting to

91
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,899
changing the regulations in real time.

92
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:55,209
So a is gonna transform the regulatory
completely from reactive to proactive.

93
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:58,979
So next we are gonna discuss
about how these rare disease

94
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,629
approvals can be accelerated.

95
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:02,179
Rare diseases, right?

96
00:05:02,179 --> 00:05:03,289
Which needs a speed.

97
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:08,329
With the platforms, what we have now it's
gonna be adaptive trial documents that,

98
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:10,669
that update as patient data changes.

99
00:05:10,854 --> 00:05:15,354
And then patient reported outcomes
integrated directly and real time

100
00:05:15,384 --> 00:05:17,029
core reviews with the agencies.

101
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:22,464
So these advances are helping reduce
approval time by almost eight 28%.

102
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:27,029
Getting critical therapies to to
those who need the more, let's

103
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:28,589
look at the implementation roadmap.

104
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:30,299
This here is how to get started.

105
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:34,229
We have to do an assessment, understand
your current pain points, and then

106
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:38,459
foundation building set up your platform
and set up the governance, and then

107
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:42,389
process integration, connect clinical
studies, safety and regulatory systems.

108
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:46,594
And then we ought to do a scaling, expand
across the teams and bring in an AA.

109
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:50,739
Quick wins come early, and
scalability ensures long-term success.

110
00:05:51,239 --> 00:05:53,549
Let's look at the change
management consideration.

111
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,259
This is not just tech, right?

112
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:56,789
It's just a cultural shift.

113
00:05:57,489 --> 00:06:01,449
Others become content engineers, and
then teams must learn the structured

114
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:03,129
authoring and the new workflows.

115
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:07,149
We all know that change is hard,
but with the, with all the executive

116
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:10,179
support that we have, it's gonna,
it's, we are gonna manage it.

117
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:11,709
It becomes very pretty manageable.

118
00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:16,059
And then remember, this is
not just admin work, it's a

119
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:19,149
strategic content engineering,
which fuels a lot of innovation.

120
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:20,909
What are the key takeaways?

121
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:23,059
Let's recap the four key ideas.

122
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:28,159
Time is lives every day, saved to
help patients, and then platform

123
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:30,929
thinking, which drives scale and speed.

124
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:35,819
Global by design launch in all
markets very faster, in a quicker way.

125
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:40,124
And then a exhilaration turns
bottlenecks into breakthroughs.

126
00:06:40,664 --> 00:06:45,584
The companies that master these will
lead to the next wave in life senses.

127
00:06:46,084 --> 00:06:49,734
So what you can do next, you can
benchmark your current document cycle

128
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:54,414
times, identify reuse opportunities,
map your existing tech stack.

129
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:56,919
Start with high value areas.

130
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:01,469
Evaluate platforms like OW, vault
and Plan a phase rollout every day.

131
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:03,809
We save in regulatory means,
getting life changing, treat.

132
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:08,619
Every day we save in regulatory, which
means getting a life changing treatments

133
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:11,139
to patients in a much, much faster way.

134
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,009
And I would like to thank you
for providing this opportunity.

135
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:19,569
I really appreciate your support and I
got a chance to represent this innovative.

136
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:22,529
So thanks everyone and I
really appreciate your support.
