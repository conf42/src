00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,070
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,090
My name is Paula.

3
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,090
I'm a principal engineer at Zscaler.

4
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,420
And before Zscaler, I was in Adobe for
almost 11 years, working on multiple

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,210
products from Adobe Sign PDF, Adobe
X to Adobe Xpr, and also enterprise

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,520
solutions like Adobe Experience Manager.

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,700
Today I'll be walking you through
how to design tokens can evolve from

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:27,099
a design tool into true platform
infrastructure and a scalable,

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,710
multiple platform design systems.

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,610
So the big problem in
fragmentation, right?

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,330
Traditional design system
phase fragmentation, static

12
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,099
style guides don't scale.

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,890
Hand of create frozen drift and siloed
implementation result in inconsistent

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:51,740
user experiences, works manual design
works, aids to a technical date.

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,350
This fragmentation.

16
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,900
Starts three groups.

17
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,310
Basically, the customer expect
consistent branded journeys.

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,310
Engineers want automation and governance
and designers needs as a leading,

19
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:10,320
but without the manual overhead,
without alignment, all three suffers.

20
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,460
So here is the paradigm shift
tokens as infrastructure.

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,180
So design tokens represents a cept
instead of just a static fellows.

22
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,600
We treat design decisions as
programmable infrastructure.

23
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,900
These decisions becomes version able
to reusable and aligned with platform

24
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,475
engineering Principles like automation
and sales service bookings are.

25
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:41,975
These design tokens basically
are structured in hierarchy.

26
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:46,415
The role values evolve
into global semantic, and

27
00:01:47,045 --> 00:01:49,505
finally, the component tokens.

28
00:01:49,895 --> 00:01:55,985
This progressive abstractions provide
flexibility while ensuring consistency

29
00:01:55,985 --> 00:01:57,820
and a single source of truth.

30
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,350
How this orchestration
pipeline works, right?

31
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,850
Tokens are defined in
source format, ization.

32
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,009
They're transformed fi the build pipelines
into platform specific targets like the

33
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:14,930
CSS variables, SWIFT code or Android xmo.

34
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,600
One definitions, many output.

35
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,880
Then the team composition.

36
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:27,050
I took in for system enable automated
team generations multi-brand identity,

37
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,030
light, dark modes and accessible
driven teams can all be created

38
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,250
without duplicating definitions.

39
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:40,100
In our use case at Zscaler we have our
system design system called Nimbus.

40
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,050
We were able to consulate repositories
and implementing tokens which

41
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:49,850
reduce the bundle size by two 40
kilobytes and improve the first

42
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:55,290
Contentful paint, which is also a very
important web vital to almost 18%.

43
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,720
Then GitHub's workflows and types
of users and developers experience.

44
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:06,910
This is the case study, if forced
500 enterprise rolled out tokens

45
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:12,970
across seven product lines and
three acquisitions Result seven, 3%

46
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,240
sew designing stances, 40% foster
feature development, and a hundred

47
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,340
percent automated WIC gap compliance.

48
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,240
Then, so when you talk about governance
and compliance the governance

49
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,850
ensures the trust decision, schema,
validation, and forces standard.

50
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,350
Automated contrast testing
guarantees accessibility.

51
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:43,200
The peer approval bring in
cross-functional alignment and

52
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,209
documentation updates automatically.

53
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:51,325
And this is the how the lifecycle
works for the whole token system.

54
00:03:51,894 --> 00:03:56,635
If formal lifecycle answers,
evolution without the cows token

55
00:03:56,635 --> 00:04:01,015
moves through the creation, review,
distribution, monitoring, and

56
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:06,265
structured deprecation process, this
balance, innovation and stability.

57
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:12,599
From the developers ex perspective,
the difference is night and day before

58
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,700
we have scattered hard coded values.

59
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:19,529
And after that, now we have type
safe tokens id auto complete

60
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,939
and single source of truth.

61
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:24,309
The, we all definitely
have a lot of challenges.

62
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:26,079
Adoption is never smooth.

63
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:30,389
Resist chains, legal systems
complicate integrations and

64
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:32,369
the governance may seem risky.

65
00:04:32,369 --> 00:04:37,499
Risky, but with code mods, phase
rollout, schema validation and proof

66
00:04:37,499 --> 00:04:40,019
points, these challenges are solvable.

67
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:48,409
And how if phase rollout works right,
you start with the audits and standards,

68
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:51,259
then set up the foundation report.

69
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:56,089
Run a pilot, then scale and
automate pipelines, finally

70
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:58,339
drive continuous improvements.

71
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,969
What are the key takeaway
from all of this?

72
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,039
Tokens are infrastructure,
not just the styling.

73
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,359
They deliver a single source of
truth, automated compliance, and

74
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:09,889
measuring efficiency against.

75
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:16,659
The call to action assessor design system
maturity starts with a focus pilot and

76
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:18,909
build governance alongside architecture.

77
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:25,249
This is how we scale design system
for future, and I always say design

78
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:29,029
token source to your API contract
between the design and development.

79
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:35,009
So hope you all like the
presentation and thanks.
