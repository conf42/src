1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,720
Hey, hello, and welcome, everyone.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:06,500
Thank you for joining me and tuning out to
this talk on harmonizing code and Melanie.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,620
I'm actually quite thrilled because
we're going to do something quite

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,840
special today, we're going to create
our own new songs, new electronica

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,560
songs, in just a matter of speaking.

6
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:19,990
And for this, we'll be using music
agent, which is actually a blend

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,630
of multiple technologies, which
will enable us in creating those.

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:29,820
But hey, before doing that,
let me first introduce myself.

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,170
I am Jan van Wassenhoven.

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,320
I am the lead architect at Sopra
Stereo Benelux for the business

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,520
line design and development.

12
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:39,900
Also, quite a fun fact, I am the creator
of the Scrum Programming Language.

13
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,360
And by Scrum Programming Language,
I don't mean the Scrum methodology.

14
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,820
Of course, it's inspired by
this methodology, but it's

15
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,784
the actual Scrum methodology.

16
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:52,895
programming language where you can type
in, you can write your own scrum code.

17
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:57,695
And by doing so, you can actually call
yourself a scrum master programmer.

18
00:00:57,935 --> 00:01:00,634
don't hesitate in checking
out that code and compiling

19
00:01:00,635 --> 00:01:01,814
your own scrum code of course.

20
00:01:02,314 --> 00:01:05,824
As we're going to talk about music, of
course, you can find me on SoundCloud

21
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:09,994
as well as on Spotify as Mighty John, I
got my own Instagram channel as well as

22
00:01:09,994 --> 00:01:14,934
my blog where you can find any updates
and any news on music agents as well.

23
00:01:15,434 --> 00:01:18,534
Because, hey, we're going to talk
about creating some new songs, some

24
00:01:18,544 --> 00:01:23,644
new music, electronical music in this
case, whereas I myself, I was always

25
00:01:23,644 --> 00:01:25,564
a big fan of listening to music.

26
00:01:26,104 --> 00:01:30,754
I was wanted to create my own music, but
yeah, I'm lacking those capabilities.

27
00:01:30,754 --> 00:01:32,814
I got my wife playing the org, the piano.

28
00:01:32,814 --> 00:01:34,194
She knows how to sing.

29
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:39,074
I got my son playing the drums, the
guitar, but yeah, from my end, I

30
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,344
did never get, got that worked out.

31
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:44,134
But there's something
else I'm quite good at.

32
00:01:44,274 --> 00:01:45,314
I know how to code.

33
00:01:45,504 --> 00:01:49,744
I know how to develop and integrate
multiple technologies all together.

34
00:01:50,314 --> 00:01:52,484
And that's where the idea
of MusicAgent came up.

35
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:54,904
Quick introduction to MusicAgent.

36
00:01:55,234 --> 00:01:58,994
It's a homegrown project where
the main coding is done in Python.

37
00:01:59,344 --> 00:02:02,434
It's open source and it's
fully available on HitUp.

38
00:02:02,444 --> 00:02:05,084
So you can check it out and
you can start creating your

39
00:02:05,114 --> 00:02:07,414
own songs on your own, at home.

40
00:02:08,364 --> 00:02:11,884
It's mostly based on using LLMs
and image model generation.

41
00:02:11,884 --> 00:02:17,164
So we'll be using OpenAI or Anthropic
APIs and we'll be using BlankChain

42
00:02:17,174 --> 00:02:19,604
for integration with those APIs.

43
00:02:20,104 --> 00:02:21,604
So what does it actually do?

44
00:02:21,644 --> 00:02:24,424
it's capable of publishing
a complete new song.

45
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:27,944
And as an end result, you'll be
having your Sonic Pi song code.

46
00:02:28,694 --> 00:02:31,834
Whether or not you choose or not,
you can also have a recording.

47
00:02:32,354 --> 00:02:36,344
It's capable of integrating your
own audio samples within your music.

48
00:02:36,974 --> 00:02:38,804
It will generate an album cover.

49
00:02:39,294 --> 00:02:42,564
If you want to, of course, and
it will even generate a full

50
00:02:42,574 --> 00:02:46,114
booklet with the lyrics and some
documentation on your song, how the

51
00:02:46,114 --> 00:02:48,404
song was composed and generated.

52
00:02:48,904 --> 00:02:53,284
But first, while we talk about
creating a song, we have to take

53
00:02:53,284 --> 00:02:56,854
some, some measurements into account
because creating a song is not about

54
00:02:56,874 --> 00:03:00,064
just, Starting, starting to sing
or, combining some instruments, no.

55
00:03:00,144 --> 00:03:02,254
There are a lot of different
phases involved in the

56
00:03:02,254 --> 00:03:03,704
process of creating a song.

57
00:03:04,044 --> 00:03:06,204
Whereas, on one hand,
we have the songwriting.

58
00:03:06,204 --> 00:03:10,374
We need to come up with an initial
melody and create some new lyrics.

59
00:03:10,684 --> 00:03:12,214
We have to structure the song.

60
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:13,864
We have to play some instruments.

61
00:03:13,864 --> 00:03:18,304
We have to arrange the instruments
throughout the, full play of the song.

62
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:21,034
And in the end, we need to
capture that performance.

63
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,724
We need to make a real
recording of our new song.

64
00:03:24,214 --> 00:03:27,774
There's some polishing up to do,
so some mixing, some remastering,

65
00:03:28,224 --> 00:03:32,554
where we have some, maybe some silent
pauses that we want to get rid of.

66
00:03:32,594 --> 00:03:36,324
Maybe we want to add an intro or an
outro with a fade in or a fade out.

67
00:03:37,274 --> 00:03:39,574
So there's also that
final polishing coming up.

68
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:43,344
And in the end we need to
generate the final product.

69
00:03:43,344 --> 00:03:47,364
So that also means even including
an album cover and some technical

70
00:03:47,364 --> 00:03:50,464
details, some technical information
about the creation of the song.

71
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,814
So how do we do that with the music agent?

72
00:03:53,914 --> 00:03:57,024
quite simply, we just pray to the AI God.

73
00:03:57,844 --> 00:04:00,194
No, not fully like that.

74
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:02,254
It's a bit more complex.

75
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:07,719
But still, first things first,
a music agent is actually based

76
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:10,339
on a MAS, a multi agent system.

77
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:12,519
And what does that actually mean?

78
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:20,299
So a MAS, a M A S, it's actually a
system combining multiple autonomous

79
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,659
agents, where each of your agent
is focusing, has an individual

80
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:26,539
focus and an individual mission.

81
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:32,939
So coming from a complex Problem, which
is in this case creation of a song, we'll

82
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:38,909
be defining it in different parts where
every agent can have its own individual

83
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:43,449
focus and its own mission as part of
the creation of the goal, where in the

84
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,549
end they will work and interact with
each other to achieve a common goal.

85
00:04:48,429 --> 00:04:51,929
In the context of music agent, of
course, this means we'll, splitting

86
00:04:51,929 --> 00:04:55,209
up the different component tasks
like the creation of the, setting

87
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:57,439
up the melody, defining the harmony.

88
00:04:58,094 --> 00:05:02,424
Creating a ribbon, choosing the samples
within the song where each and every

89
00:05:02,424 --> 00:05:04,264
agent will have this different task.

90
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:10,494
But collaborating within those tasks, they
will come up with a creative and cohesive

91
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:15,684
composition, a new song, a new electronica
song at the end of the process.

92
00:05:16,494 --> 00:05:21,174
So by doing that, we had to overcome
some, different challenges, like we

93
00:05:21,174 --> 00:05:22,554
had some technical hurdles, like.

94
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:26,129
the song code is being created,
being generated in Sonic Pi, and

95
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:28,239
Sonic Pi itself has some limitations.

96
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:30,089
So we had to counter those.

97
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:33,749
It's quite limited in terms of synths,
in terms of samples that can be used.

98
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:36,109
So we had to, find some, workarounds.

99
00:05:36,634 --> 00:05:42,344
Also, the LLM, the usage of the LLM is
quite, restricted, quite limited and

100
00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:44,494
we need to set it in the right context.

101
00:05:44,854 --> 00:05:48,914
But it's also all about promoting
the right answers and how do we deal

102
00:05:49,064 --> 00:05:53,374
with, token limitation because by the
end, by promoting, multiple answers,

103
00:05:53,734 --> 00:05:57,444
we'll come up with a broad context,
a broad amount of, prompts that

104
00:05:57,474 --> 00:05:59,754
we are being sent to those agents.

105
00:06:00,334 --> 00:06:01,934
And of course, we have some limitations.

106
00:06:01,934 --> 00:06:04,894
We have some token and character
limitations while calling the APIs

107
00:06:05,204 --> 00:06:06,894
for which we had to deal with.

108
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:11,294
Then again, while talking about multiple
phase, we need to change the agents.

109
00:06:11,294 --> 00:06:14,874
So how can we set the
correct conversation context?

110
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,729
How do we make sure that
the correct outcome is being

111
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:19,149
processed to the next agent.

112
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:22,119
So at the end that we
come up with a full song.

113
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:27,019
And then finally, there's also the
choice of model of AI model for the

114
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:30,679
different AIs, because depending on
what they are doing, depending on

115
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:35,309
the need, It's quite some difference
in between and we encountered

116
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:38,049
that while starting with GPT 3.

117
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:41,059
5 at the beginning and
now using lots of 4.

118
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,120
0 for MINI or the Cloud 3.

119
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,139
5 SONNET.

120
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:47,459
For instance, there's a lot of difference
in, in the outcome where one is better

121
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:51,029
in image generation, another one is
already better in coding, for instance.

122
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:56,139
So a lot of, testing and, involved
it, but it's also one of the

123
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,179
challenges that we need to overcome.

124
00:06:58,859 --> 00:07:03,179
Let's take a look at the flow of
Musicaging, how it actually works.

125
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:08,329
from, a user perspective, we will
interact with music agents ba, with a CLI

126
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:11,564
or with a, a gui with a web interface.

127
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:14,344
So you get the choice to do,
you can rather choose the CLI

128
00:07:14,344 --> 00:07:16,124
or you can, do it by, gui.

129
00:07:16,424 --> 00:07:20,644
That's your choice, to do But then when
doing so, we provide some initial input on

130
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:22,434
how we want, want the song to look like.

131
00:07:22,434 --> 00:07:25,699
Could be, a sentence, could be
a full description of your song.

132
00:07:25,989 --> 00:07:29,869
But that's where the first phase,
the first agents, come into practice.

133
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:31,949
So we start with a design phase.

134
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:37,429
Design phase is all about coming up with
a concept, describing the lyrics, setting

135
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:42,359
the arrangements, defining on the amount
of verses, chorus, whether or not we use

136
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:48,749
a bridge, do we implement a solo, do we
use an outro, but also which instruments

137
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,269
will play the verse, which instruments
will be used during the chorus.

138
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:57,059
And, might, also interesting, while
we'll be creating electronic music, we

139
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,949
want to include some, the possibility,
the availability of samples.

140
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:06,519
So we can have our own, mashup of
samples that can be used, but depending

141
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:10,149
on the initial input we gave, the
concept we came up, we are gonna choose

142
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:14,489
within the, the listing of samples,
which one is the most suitable in

143
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:16,949
usage, while creating that new song.

144
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:20,469
wrapping that all up, that's our
design phase, that's, once we have

145
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,409
this phase, accomplished, we can
actually start coding the song.

146
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,679
let's go.

147
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:26,659
We're getting to the creation phase.

148
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:29,889
So within the creation phase, our
agent, one of our agents will come

149
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:34,899
up with a first proposal of a song in
Sonic Pie code, and then the process

150
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:36,699
start iterating all over again.

151
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:39,839
This, this code, so we'll be
starting to reviewed the code.

152
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:46,509
The code will be reviewed by other agents,
and, being, adapted based on those, Review

153
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:51,109
input, the code will be adapted by our
initial agent, our Sonic Pi coder again.

154
00:08:51,609 --> 00:08:54,339
After some iterations, we even
have the possibility also to

155
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:58,319
include human interaction from
us ourselves as song creators.

156
00:08:58,319 --> 00:09:02,009
So we can actually listen to the song,
and by doing that, we can provide,

157
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:06,929
additional input, in order to create
and improve the song, in the end.

158
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:11,819
Then, finally, we come in a mastering
phase where we're actually starting

159
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:15,539
to check on, is everything, sounding
quite properly, are there any,

160
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:19,749
fade in, fade outs needed, do we
have some silent pauses that need

161
00:09:19,749 --> 00:09:23,669
to be excluded, so we're actually
starting the polishing of the song.

162
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:28,699
Where in the end we can come to the
publishing phase and publishing phase

163
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:34,139
means actual, creating the recording, the
album cover, as well as the full booklet

164
00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:39,639
of the song, meaning the full technical
details of the, with the lyrics, the,

165
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:43,649
the initial input that was used, but
also the concept that we came up with,

166
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:45,879
that our agents came up with in the end.

167
00:09:46,624 --> 00:09:50,444
Which will all be stored on your local
drive, together with the booklet,

168
00:09:50,884 --> 00:09:56,594
the song album, as well as the
actual song, the WAV recording file.

169
00:09:57,094 --> 00:09:59,354
on a side note, you might
have noticed something.

170
00:09:59,714 --> 00:10:03,684
While discussing this chain of
agents, it might have, started

171
00:10:03,684 --> 00:10:05,494
you thinking about something else.

172
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:09,314
And something else could have been
this software development life cycle.

173
00:10:09,654 --> 00:10:13,704
Because in the end, while we'll
are developing also new software.

174
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,564
We're also gathering requirements
like conceptualization of a song.

175
00:10:17,574 --> 00:10:19,424
We're also doing an analysis.

176
00:10:19,454 --> 00:10:22,964
We're also gathering requirements
and coming up with a proper design

177
00:10:23,014 --> 00:10:24,774
of our application software.

178
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:30,024
While in the second phase, we start to
create the song in terms of MusicAgent,

179
00:10:30,034 --> 00:10:34,584
but in the software development cycle,
this would mean implementation and

180
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:39,299
coding and reviewing it, testing it,
As we did for our song it's actually

181
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:42,679
quite the same in software development
where our application is being tested,

182
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:46,289
being reviewed, could be sent back
to the developer to be adapted.

183
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:50,369
Where in the end we're going to deploy
it, we're going to actually produce

184
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:54,049
the software, it will be deployed
and will be set up in production.

185
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,859
Same as creating a full song,
your WAV, your recording file as

186
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:02,989
well with a full booklet and it
can still be adapted afterwards.

187
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:07,499
But hey, let's get back to
MusicAgent and a full glimpse

188
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,119
on the architecture overview.

189
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:13,199
So as mentioned, we can
interact via CLI or via the GUI.

190
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:17,019
where we'll be calling a
bunch of Python code scripts.

191
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:21,679
So these code scripts will actually,
launch our different AI agents, which

192
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,119
will, start doing the work, depending
on the phase we're in, depending

193
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:28,449
on which, part of the component
of the song creation we're in.

194
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:33,329
And by doing so, they will do this based
on, a couple of configuration files that

195
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:38,239
will, Tell the agents in what order they
need to produce their task and how they

196
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,369
should conclude or should continue based
on the input, based on the different

197
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:46,159
tasks that they were provided to.

198
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:51,119
The agents ourself, they will interact
with, providers like OpenAI or Anthropic.

199
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:54,359
So they will be using those APIs
in order to create, a new song

200
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:57,839
or create new images and so on.

201
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:02,489
Actually, also while, providing,
while exchanging in between agents at

202
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:06,319
one point during the creation phase,
there is also, in human interaction

203
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:10,009
possible, but while before doing
so, you need to listen to the song.

204
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:12,449
So in order to be able to.

205
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:13,574
listen to the song.

206
00:12:13,584 --> 00:12:16,644
We'll also be interacting with
Sonic Pi, and we can do this by

207
00:12:16,644 --> 00:12:19,434
using OSC, Open Sound Control.

208
00:12:19,744 --> 00:12:23,624
So this will enable you to have some,
some, playback of the song already,

209
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:25,964
while your agents are working on it.

210
00:12:25,994 --> 00:12:28,884
You'll, get to have a hearing of
the initial, song, proposition.

211
00:12:29,384 --> 00:12:32,694
And by the end of course we'll
have our, production of our song.

212
00:12:32,694 --> 00:12:36,794
We have the actual booklet,
the actual, WEV file, as well

213
00:12:36,794 --> 00:12:38,224
as the album cover and so on.

214
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:42,844
And as mentioned, do throughout the
process because we can hear the feedback.

215
00:12:42,844 --> 00:12:48,124
There's always a possibility in return to
the CLI or as well as the GUI to interact

216
00:12:48,124 --> 00:12:52,394
with our agents and to have, to add some
additional information or some, to provide

217
00:12:52,394 --> 00:12:54,854
some remarks on the song to our agents.

218
00:12:55,144 --> 00:12:59,254
to improve the final song that
will be created in the end.

219
00:12:59,754 --> 00:13:01,554
in practice, how does it look like?

220
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:04,464
I mentioned there are a couple
of, config files that can be

221
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:06,054
used to set up Music Agent.

222
00:13:06,434 --> 00:13:10,044
first of all, we have the configuration
of our artist in which we will define

223
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:14,484
how the album will look like, what's
our styling, but also the different type

224
00:13:14,484 --> 00:13:18,594
of assistance that will be cooperating
together throughout the song creation.

225
00:13:18,594 --> 00:13:22,504
from an artist who will come up
with a concept or a coder that will

226
00:13:22,554 --> 00:13:25,354
actually write the code in Sonic Pi.

227
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:31,894
Secondly, once we got our, assistant,
defined, we have our, artist,

228
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:37,124
configured, we need to define, the
different phases throughout the process.

229
00:13:37,194 --> 00:13:40,154
for instance, we have a phase of
songwriting where a song, where the

230
00:13:40,214 --> 00:13:44,744
song need to be, written, where we have
our, songwriter agent that will actually

231
00:13:44,744 --> 00:13:46,794
come up with, the lyrics of the song.

232
00:13:47,204 --> 00:13:51,024
They will, be given some, advice,
some, some remarks via the composer,

233
00:13:51,094 --> 00:13:55,454
another agent, which already collects
information as well as from us during the

234
00:13:55,764 --> 00:13:57,774
composition, the conceptualization phase.

235
00:13:58,154 --> 00:14:03,094
So as you can see within the, within
the configuration as well, we will be

236
00:14:03,094 --> 00:14:06,884
providing already some initial input
like a theme, a melody, a rhythm, and

237
00:14:06,884 --> 00:14:10,604
in an outcome we'll have, some lyrics
as well as a structure of the song.

238
00:14:11,104 --> 00:14:15,014
That being said, we get the assistance, we
get the description of different phases,

239
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:19,244
like for instance songwrite, might as well
be the recording, the album generation, as

240
00:14:19,244 --> 00:14:21,754
well as the sonic bi coding of your song.

241
00:14:22,254 --> 00:14:23,434
We need to bring them all together.

242
00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:27,504
finally, a third one, a third
configuration is needed, and

243
00:14:27,504 --> 00:14:30,494
that's the actual sequence
order of our different phases.

244
00:14:30,794 --> 00:14:34,584
They can be, defined in a sequential
order, but sometimes we will also

245
00:14:34,584 --> 00:14:37,634
be needing to iterate multiple
times all over the same phase again.

246
00:14:37,994 --> 00:14:42,124
And, one good example of this, of
course, is the writing of the song

247
00:14:42,134 --> 00:14:44,144
while we'll be writing Sonic Pi code.

248
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:47,884
This code will be reviewed and will
have to be modified afterwards.

249
00:14:47,884 --> 00:14:52,744
So we can define ourselves the
multiple of, the amount of iterations

250
00:14:52,754 --> 00:14:57,264
that will be needed to go through
the song and to correct this song.

251
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:01,684
just an example of MusicAgent
practice using the basic flow.

252
00:15:01,974 --> 00:15:05,214
pre configuration file will be
defining the role of the artist, the

253
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:08,304
chaining and the different phases.

254
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:11,014
there are multiple configurations
possible, I will show more

255
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,914
in the IDE afterwards.

256
00:15:13,734 --> 00:15:16,554
But that's, there's a
basic setup available.

257
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:17,669
Within music agent.

258
00:15:18,109 --> 00:15:19,459
So we got the chaining.

259
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:23,479
So we start from a user query prompt
or from the GUI, where we start a

260
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:26,999
different phase from coming up with
a concept to actually writing the

261
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:28,759
song and creating the final song.

262
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:31,979
for instance, within the
concept, we got our agents.

263
00:15:32,374 --> 00:15:36,984
talking to one another, the artist talking
to a composer, providing some initial

264
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:42,834
input to come up with a final idea for the
song and a concept of the song and so on.

265
00:15:43,184 --> 00:15:46,574
But for instance, when we go to the
song code review, there are multiple

266
00:15:46,604 --> 00:15:48,314
agents connected to one another.

267
00:15:48,654 --> 00:15:52,504
Where one is doing the code review
of the song, another agent will start

268
00:15:52,804 --> 00:15:57,654
modifying and correcting the code
based on the input of this code review.

269
00:15:58,154 --> 00:16:00,214
And we can even go a bit further.

270
00:16:00,674 --> 00:16:03,634
While adapting those different
configuration file, we can extend

271
00:16:03,634 --> 00:16:07,704
them with initial, with additional,
possibilities, for instance, we can

272
00:16:07,744 --> 00:16:12,644
add a human code review phase, which
will actually enable, in setting up, in

273
00:16:12,644 --> 00:16:17,324
sending out a, a, where we can define
an agent to send out, OSC commands to

274
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:20,994
make sure that we can have a playback
of the song where the human, can

275
00:16:21,004 --> 00:16:22,704
review while listening to the song.

276
00:16:22,714 --> 00:16:26,934
He can, provide some review and taps
in some review via the console or

277
00:16:26,954 --> 00:16:32,094
via the GUI where afterwards code
modification can take place and where

278
00:16:32,094 --> 00:16:36,964
we can re listen to the song until we
are, completely, glad or agreeing with

279
00:16:37,184 --> 00:16:38,874
the final composition of the song.

280
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:42,064
Also, we can extend it
with, song recording.

281
00:16:42,324 --> 00:16:44,734
Song recording can be done via Sonic Pi.

282
00:16:44,784 --> 00:16:48,534
again, we'll be using Open Sound
Control to interact with Sonic Pi,

283
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:53,474
where we can have a playback and
generate an actual WV recording,

284
00:16:53,824 --> 00:16:56,144
which is your actual song at the end.

285
00:16:56,644 --> 00:17:00,394
that being said, that might be
time for a little demo and an

286
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,014
introduction to the code itself.

287
00:17:02,979 --> 00:17:05,669
first of all, let's go
to the project itself.

288
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:08,199
I got my project opened in IntelliJ.

289
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:11,119
it comes up with a bunch of readme files.

290
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,319
It's quite extensive.

291
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,849
It's quite extensively explained
how you can set it up locally,

292
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,149
how you can use it on your own.

293
00:17:17,649 --> 00:17:20,179
As a code basis, it's quite limited.

294
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:26,489
There's a bunch of Python scripts, some
configuration to be set up that can be

295
00:17:26,489 --> 00:17:30,269
configured, but it comes already with the
default stack of configuration, so you

296
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:36,169
can actually, by simply installing all
the libraries, you can be quickly up and

297
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:38,239
running and start launching MusicAgent.

298
00:17:38,639 --> 00:17:41,959
first I want to, bring your
attention to one particular folder,

299
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:43,279
which is the agent configuration.

300
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:47,969
As I mentioned, we have multiple
configuration files available that enable

301
00:17:47,969 --> 00:17:52,699
us to define the creation of the song,
the how we will chain up our agents.

302
00:17:53,089 --> 00:17:57,709
So we start with the default, Default
one that can be used, the one I showed

303
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:02,479
earlier on, which is the Mighty John,
but of course we got the art, evaluation

304
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,079
and full other setups that can be used.

305
00:18:05,399 --> 00:18:09,679
But basically, it comes to setting up
the different assistants within your

306
00:18:09,739 --> 00:18:13,339
artist configuration file, where you
can even define your style, which will

307
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:15,589
be used for the cover art creation.

308
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:19,479
There is the music creation
phase, where we define the

309
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:20,629
different phases of the music.

310
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:24,329
of the creation of a song, like for
instance, as you can see, songwriting,

311
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:27,629
different segmentations where we
define, which arrangement do we

312
00:18:27,629 --> 00:18:29,819
have one verse, two verse, chorus.

313
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:34,419
there's the arrangements, that need,
that are going to be defined, meaning

314
00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:38,949
which instruments will be using,
sampling phase, initial song coding.

315
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:42,599
And you can also notice now the
different prompts being used.

316
00:18:42,934 --> 00:18:46,564
throughout the process for those
different agents, as well as the input

317
00:18:46,614 --> 00:18:48,754
and output of those, those prompts.

318
00:18:49,114 --> 00:18:50,154
these are the phases.

319
00:18:50,184 --> 00:18:53,874
There's a third file, which is the
creation chain, where we actually

320
00:18:53,874 --> 00:18:57,154
define the different, phase to
be used throughout the process.

321
00:18:57,394 --> 00:19:01,094
Different agent configurations, where
is the difference in between, might

322
00:19:01,094 --> 00:19:04,434
be John, the default configuration
consists of the simple song creation

323
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,484
with some, iterations on code review.

324
00:19:06,864 --> 00:19:10,664
Whereas, for example, the art
configuration, only consists

325
00:19:10,664 --> 00:19:11,944
of creating cover art.

326
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:15,044
So you just bring out a concept, it
will not create a song, but it will

327
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:20,064
come up with cover art creation, a cover
album creation, whereas the full, for

328
00:19:20,064 --> 00:19:23,934
instance, involves human interaction,
involves cover creation, but also

329
00:19:23,934 --> 00:19:27,354
the actual WEV recording in the end.

330
00:19:27,854 --> 00:19:31,814
Next to that, in terms of setup, there's
also the samples folders where you can

331
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:35,944
easily yourself integrate your own samples
that can be used throughout the process.

332
00:19:35,994 --> 00:19:39,694
it's, you can simply drag and drop
your samples in and it will be

333
00:19:39,714 --> 00:19:41,384
reloaded throughout the process.

334
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:45,435
And they will be used depending on your
concept, depending on the direction

335
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:49,624
you're going to, they can be introduced,
they can be used throughout the process.

336
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:52,944
besides that, we, have some setup folders.

337
00:19:53,294 --> 00:19:57,344
More importantly, there are two
ways in launching our, music agent.

338
00:19:57,344 --> 00:20:00,524
as I mentioned, we can
do this via the CLI.

339
00:20:00,914 --> 00:20:02,974
Simply by running python run.

340
00:20:03,054 --> 00:20:03,714
py.

341
00:20:04,214 --> 00:20:06,254
And it's slowly starting up now.

342
00:20:06,754 --> 00:20:11,834
where it'll provide you some choices,
okay, which API provider you want to use.

343
00:20:11,864 --> 00:20:13,994
In this case, I will be choosing, OpenAI.

344
00:20:14,544 --> 00:20:18,164
it asks me the type of model,
the type of, agent configuration

345
00:20:18,164 --> 00:20:19,124
you'd like to be using.

346
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:22,764
in this case, I will be,
start, I'll use mighty John.

347
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:29,129
And then we can go on in entering the
name of the song, but besides doing this

348
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:36,019
via the API, of course, there is the,
you can also use the web application.

349
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:41,249
as I showed you, you can use CLI for
interacting with MusicAgent, but we can

350
00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:43,979
also use the web browser for interacting.

351
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:47,589
So there's a, an application, a web
application available with MusicAgent.

352
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:51,429
We can do it completely the
same as we did within the CLI.

353
00:20:51,879 --> 00:20:54,589
It also comes with a song configuration
again, where you can choose the

354
00:20:54,649 --> 00:20:56,369
API provider, the model to be used.

355
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:59,429
And of course, the agent
type can be selected.

356
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:02,619
And even while interacting with
it, you can even still make some

357
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:06,109
modifications to the configuration
of your agents, as well as the

358
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:08,459
assistance genres that are included.

359
00:21:09,249 --> 00:21:11,489
let's start creating our own song then.

360
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:14,019
Let me come up with a title.

361
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:16,489
Let's call it the banana song.

362
00:21:16,989 --> 00:21:18,609
I'm almost at summer vibes.

363
00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:22,839
the banana song, I will choose
electro, but again the genres are

364
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:26,279
also depending on your configuration,
your agent configuration, but

365
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:28,139
I'll choose electro in this case.

366
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:39,289
Let me make it a song about a couple of
bananas at the beach, maybe, as we're

367
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:43,139
in a summer vibe mood, at the beach.

368
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:45,869
Drinking some cocktails.

369
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:53,769
the song, let it, the song is
inspired by late 90's music.

370
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:56,384
Cause hey, I'm a 90's
guy and I can't drink.

371
00:21:56,734 --> 00:21:59,054
tend to appreciate that type of music.

372
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:02,514
So that being said, so
we got everything set up.

373
00:22:02,534 --> 00:22:05,454
We can start generating some new music.

374
00:22:05,494 --> 00:22:06,424
So there we go.

375
00:22:06,804 --> 00:22:07,384
And it's done.

376
00:22:07,454 --> 00:22:11,769
And you notice Underneath, we have
quite some setup being done already.

377
00:22:12,189 --> 00:22:14,379
you can have different badges activated.

378
00:22:14,379 --> 00:22:18,099
So first of all, we can see the
input parameters being passed

379
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:19,649
by, through our music agent.

380
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:22,709
And you'll notice along the
way, it's getting filled in with

381
00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:24,849
everything provided by our agents.

382
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:27,049
On the right, we see our timeline.

383
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:32,109
So this is based on the setup for the
default agent type, which contains the

384
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:35,779
timeline, a timeline with the different
phases include like conceptualization,

385
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:37,899
songwriting, segmentation, and so on.

386
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:42,509
But we also notice the iterations
when it comes to song code review.

387
00:22:43,264 --> 00:22:46,304
In this run, the default setup,
there's no human interaction, but

388
00:22:46,304 --> 00:22:50,534
this is also due to the fact that
we want to speed up a bit because,

389
00:22:50,604 --> 00:22:52,304
the iterations can take quite long.

390
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:56,844
So that's why we do for, the sake of the
demo, we do the basic setup, the default

391
00:22:56,854 --> 00:23:01,254
stack, with a couple of iterations, as
you notice, two cycles for code reviewing,

392
00:23:01,724 --> 00:23:06,269
where we'll, almost At the end, proceeding
down, you can also notice in, MusicAgent,

393
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:10,589
you can follow up the agent conversations
in between, how they interact with one

394
00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:14,869
another, where you can also see, the
amount of information which is being

395
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:17,139
sent and, outputted along the way.

396
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:22,149
And while we notice, this, cover being
created from a couple of bananas drinking,

397
00:23:22,249 --> 00:23:23,829
A cocktail at the beach, of course.

398
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:27,449
Accordingly, you can follow up the logs.

399
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:33,109
And also quite interesting is also there's
a view on the different code, the Sonic

400
00:23:33,109 --> 00:23:37,449
Pi code, which is being created, which,
you, where you also have the availability

401
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:40,399
to playback it or to send it to Sonic Pi.

402
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:46,129
if we return to IntelliJ,
let's get back to our IDE.

403
00:23:46,129 --> 00:23:49,669
You'll notice that in the meantime,
a new folder has been created,

404
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:51,979
which includes the banana song.

405
00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:57,979
And where we also can find back our
Sonic by song creation, our complete

406
00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:00,439
file, with the coding of the song.

407
00:24:00,729 --> 00:24:04,539
It includes the album cover,
as well as the readme, which is

408
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:06,049
the full booklet of your song.

409
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:08,579
let's have a quick look, if I can.

410
00:24:09,334 --> 00:24:12,534
Take along all the code and
put it back in Sonic Pi.

411
00:24:13,014 --> 00:24:15,924
So it gives us something like this.

412
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:18,224
So let's give it a quick run.

413
00:24:18,225 --> 00:24:24,621
Which actually sounds
quite nice, isn't it?

414
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:25,534
Now

415
00:24:26,034 --> 00:24:29,984
Just as a small remark, it doesn't
end up always with a good result

416
00:24:30,034 --> 00:24:33,184
because depending on the amount of
iteration, depending on how your

417
00:24:33,214 --> 00:24:37,894
agent was set up, it sometimes comes
up with something completely eclectic

418
00:24:37,924 --> 00:24:42,024
or it messes up some of the, charts,
for instance, within Sonic Pi.

419
00:24:42,354 --> 00:24:46,714
there's, There might be sometimes some
modifications to be done, but then again,

420
00:24:47,044 --> 00:24:52,134
as you have the code, you have the full
logs of your song creation, you can

421
00:24:52,184 --> 00:24:54,104
adapt and you can change accordingly.

422
00:24:54,554 --> 00:24:59,324
But the more you adapt your agent, the
more you make it more detailed in terms

423
00:24:59,324 --> 00:25:03,804
of prompts, in terms of setup, and also
the chaining, the more time you give

424
00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:06,184
it, the better the results you get.

425
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:06,794
by the end.

426
00:25:06,814 --> 00:25:10,324
And also if you interfere, if
you, add some human interaction.

427
00:25:10,324 --> 00:25:16,524
So if we go back to in our IDE,
so back again to the agent config.

428
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:21,225
So let me take, for instance, the the
full setup where you can notice that,

429
00:25:21,595 --> 00:25:25,875
in this case we set up multiple code
reviews, but also multiple human reviews.

430
00:25:25,895 --> 00:25:30,305
On one hand we have the agents reviewing
some code as well as human reviews,

431
00:25:30,705 --> 00:25:36,045
but, there's also, when we take a
look at the face config, we can even

432
00:25:36,055 --> 00:25:39,135
set up the playback if I get there.

433
00:25:39,145 --> 00:25:42,674
So this we can include
code validation as well.

434
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,424
As well, along the way.

435
00:25:44,924 --> 00:25:49,724
that was for a quick example of
the code, so if we get back to the

436
00:25:49,724 --> 00:25:53,164
presentation now, to come to a conclusion.

437
00:25:53,774 --> 00:25:56,704
a small remark I wanted
to make in the end.

438
00:25:56,744 --> 00:26:00,114
This is, a quote from, Nick
Cave, which you might know.

439
00:26:00,544 --> 00:26:02,154
Quite, quite famous singer as well.

440
00:26:02,464 --> 00:26:06,904
And he, at the beginning, when they
sorted out JetGPT, the first AI

441
00:26:06,934 --> 00:26:11,454
models, he got a lot of message mails
coming in from fans, starting to say,

442
00:26:11,454 --> 00:26:13,274
okay, I can write code as you do.

443
00:26:13,634 --> 00:26:18,535
And, Quite importantly, he answered,
he, because of the amount of, people

444
00:26:18,545 --> 00:26:23,805
asking him, he said it's a blood and
guts business here at my desk that

445
00:26:23,805 --> 00:26:29,145
requires something me of me to initiate
a new and fresh idea and it requires my

446
00:26:29,145 --> 00:26:36,195
humaneness and It's quite interesting
because while, although we're using AI in

447
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:41,365
this case to create a new song, but also
in terms of coding, in terms of helping

448
00:26:41,365 --> 00:26:43,245
us out while developing new software.

449
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:47,850
It's quite important that we as
a human remain to keep the full

450
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:51,560
perspective to the full perspective
on the context on what we're doing.

451
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,650
And whether we talk about song
creation, whether we talk about software

452
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,440
development, we are in control of our AI.

453
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:02,470
And you may notice also while using music
agent while creating a new song, it's

454
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:06,380
quite important that we give feedback
that we set the right context and that we

455
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,960
direct our agent in the right direction.

456
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:10,660
Sometimes.

457
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,610
pop up with good results,
but not every time.

458
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,560
And then we need to redirect them.

459
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:20,440
So it's a nice quote, quite
important one also to keep in mind.

460
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:25,640
So as a wrap up, as a conclusion,
the full code repository is

461
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,050
available on GitHub, where you
can find MusicAgent on my account.

462
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:32,770
There's also more information to
be found on the blog mightyjohn.

463
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:33,050
com.

464
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,049
So go ahead and check that one out.

465
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,430
out.

466
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,420
If you have some more questions after
this talk, please connect with me.

467
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:44,690
Just ping me via LinkedIn or, one of the
social, social platforms, of course, are

468
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,020
also possible, but Hey, let's get started.

469
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,360
Shall we, shouldn't we
start creating some music?

470
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:51,690
Yes, we do.

471
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,250
okay.

472
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:56,750
I'll invite you to check out a music
agent and start creating your own music.

473
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,000
Thank you for listening.

474
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,130
Thank you for watching and see
you again on the next talk.

475
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:01,660
Thank you.
