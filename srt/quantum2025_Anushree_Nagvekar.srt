00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,310
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:05,830
This is Anush n. I'm a software
engineering manager at ai.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:11,650
I have a couple of articles and
done some research on Edge ai.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,040
Today I'm going to talk about how
quantum computing is supercharging edge

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,060
AI and how it impacts the processing
power size of the neural networks.

6
00:00:23,735 --> 00:00:26,555
Power usage, latency, and cost.

7
00:00:27,545 --> 00:00:31,805
By examining some of the real world
deployments across multiple sectors,

8
00:00:32,494 --> 00:00:37,775
we will talk about how edge AI
technology is revolutionizing embedded

9
00:00:37,775 --> 00:00:43,505
systems through improved processing
efficiency, reduce operational

10
00:00:43,595 --> 00:00:50,464
cost, and enhance security measures
optimized through resource utilization.

11
00:00:50,964 --> 00:00:53,065
Let's talk about the scale of a challenge.

12
00:00:53,565 --> 00:00:59,939
By 2027, it's projected that there
is going, there are going to be 75

13
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:06,585
billion iot devices in the world,
and such massive data volumes at edge

14
00:01:06,794 --> 00:01:08,324
is going to be difficult to handle.

15
00:01:08,824 --> 00:01:16,614
With quantum enhanced ai, we can have a
3.2 x boost in the processing capacity

16
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:20,604
and a 41% reduction in operational cost.

17
00:01:21,104 --> 00:01:26,145
The complexity of the edge data
at such a high resolution video.

18
00:01:27,074 --> 00:01:30,824
Medical scans or autonomous
vehicle telemetry will require

19
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,654
faster and smarter processing.

20
00:01:33,154 --> 00:01:37,144
As you know that the classical systems
need to keep up with the demands

21
00:01:37,144 --> 00:01:40,444
like latency, power and scalability.

22
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:48,244
So deploying quantum enhanced techniques
in these fields is going to exponentially

23
00:01:48,744 --> 00:01:49,819
get better results.

24
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,579
Then the classic systems.

25
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,339
Let's talk about a more hybrid approach
Through this problem, we have a quantum

26
00:01:58,339 --> 00:02:04,059
solution and a classical one, but this
is a hybrid one, which is not purely

27
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:06,579
classical and not purely quantum.

28
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:07,419
It's synergy.

29
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,869
The quantum algorithms can handle.

30
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:15,785
Optimization heavy and very
high dimensional tasks like

31
00:02:15,785 --> 00:02:19,925
routing, scheduling, or training
complex neural networks.

32
00:02:20,425 --> 00:02:26,995
Classical systems can manage routine
or deterministic tasks like IO

33
00:02:26,995 --> 00:02:29,370
operations or simple control loops.

34
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:34,220
The outcome of all these neuron
networks can then be processed with

35
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:40,130
a 3.2 x more parameters while still
meeting the sub 15 millisecond latency.

36
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:46,030
Comparing all this to classical only
systems, which plateaus at 1.4 x

37
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,250
capacity under the same constraints.

38
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,740
Now let's talk about some of the
improvements of using quantum.

39
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,990
These are some of the numbers you are
shared wherein you can see there is

40
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,470
a 78% faster optimization solving.

41
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,660
There is also a 67% reduction
in power consumption.

42
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,540
And a latency which has been reduced
to 30 millisecond compared to

43
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:16,060
the one 20 millisecond baseline,
which itself is a 76% improvement

44
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,730
in the overall latency parameter.

45
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,070
The model deployment speed is
also increased by 3.2 times

46
00:03:23,585 --> 00:03:25,380
with the quantum enhancement.

47
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,160
So these are not just real
world impact, but these are.

48
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,250
Also, these are not even like lab results.

49
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:39,100
These are actually impacts that are
having on the real world case studies

50
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,990
and scenarios that we have seen.

51
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,540
They are feasible in the industrial
automation, autonomous vehicles

52
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,980
and infrastructure domain.

53
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,090
The reduced latency and increased
deployment speed can create

54
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,205
an edge AI infrastructure that
is both agile and powerful.

55
00:03:56,705 --> 00:04:00,135
Now let's look about some of
the case studies shown here.

56
00:04:00,635 --> 00:04:04,935
In the manufacturing enterprises
domain quantum algorithms

57
00:04:05,115 --> 00:04:07,365
can be used in iot networks.

58
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:14,575
For achieving a better anomaly detection
of 82% and a reduced false alarm

59
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:17,955
rate by 43% in the healthcare domain.

60
00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:23,595
Quantum algorithms have been used in medi
medical imaging algorithms, which has a

61
00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:27,090
real time diagnostics with 91% accuracy.

62
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,790
And we also have a maintain HIPAA
compliance with all this implementation.

63
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,890
For a smart infrastructure,
quantum algorithms can be used

64
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,840
for dynamic energy distribution.

65
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,990
We achieve 37% of power savings
and faster response time with

66
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,360
our quantum classical systems.

67
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,470
So in every vertical that's tested,
the quantum classical systems have

68
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,330
outperformed the traditional ones.

69
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,650
Now let's look at some of
the neural network processing

70
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,240
capabilities of the system.

71
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,980
The classical system actually hits a
wall with only 1.4 x capacity, which

72
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:10,050
is actually increased if possible,
before latency becomes unmanageable.

73
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,420
This forces the developers to
compromise between complexity

74
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,010
and real time performance.

75
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:22,480
A hybrid model supports 3.2 times greater
capacity without latency sacrifice.

76
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,910
And how this can be achieved is
through quantum parallelization

77
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,030
efficient navigation of our systems.

78
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:36,930
In the enhanced quantum
ai, we also provide a high

79
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,700
dimensional parameter specs.

80
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,860
For this navigation, a superior
performance in spatial temporal pattern

81
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:50,505
recognition like movement tracking,
video analysis, and many other use cases.

82
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:55,265
Now let's look at some of the
resource allocation optimization.

83
00:05:55,765 --> 00:05:56,395
Techniques.

84
00:05:57,385 --> 00:06:02,185
So quantum units can be
optimized across compute, memory,

85
00:06:02,635 --> 00:06:06,255
bandwidth, and network storage.

86
00:06:06,755 --> 00:06:10,265
So the quantum networks actually
reacts to changes under 30

87
00:06:10,265 --> 00:06:13,955
milliseconds, which are 4.2 times
faster than the classical methods.

88
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,580
For example, like in the Smart Cities
case study that we looked upon, it

89
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:26,120
is adjusting the power allocation and
the autonomous vehicle fleets case

90
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,580
study wherein it actually helps to
manage bandwidth and CPU dynamically.

91
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,020
So the optimization pipeline goes
through four different steps.

92
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,360
First is getting the quantum algorithms
detect the complex dependencies.

93
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,300
Next is to explore the millions of
possible configurations in parallel.

94
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:54,520
Then we execute with precision and
control and also predict and adjust

95
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,530
according to the conditions that evolve.

96
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:01,970
Now let's talk about some of the
security and cost benefits the quantum

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,510
enhanced technology can be used to for
cryptography in the following ways.

98
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:14,140
We have a lattice based key exchange
for managing all the encryption.

99
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:19,780
We have a temp tamper evidence
signatures implemented, and also

100
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,720
multivariate polynomial encryption.

101
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:29,610
The operational cost of these
systems have gone down by 41% because

102
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:33,170
of the quantum machine learning
algorithms that are being used.

103
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,330
It also uses less power and less
hardware, which requires less maintenance.

104
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:45,220
The reliability of the system has
really gone up with a 99.99% response

105
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,795
time with AI driven fall detection.

106
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:53,530
Self-healing infrastructure
and smart redundancy systems.

107
00:07:54,030 --> 00:08:00,330
So this isn't just faster, it's
safer, cheaper, and more reliable.

108
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,505
Let's go through the implementation
roadmap for this quantum.

109
00:08:05,005 --> 00:08:09,585
First, we review the current
infrastructure and identify where

110
00:08:09,585 --> 00:08:14,985
quantum can be value added, for example,
where we can optimize the tasks.

111
00:08:15,485 --> 00:08:20,555
Next, we can test the quantum inspired
algorithms on classical hardware and

112
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:25,685
validate the performance boost for
integrating the quantum algorithms in

113
00:08:25,685 --> 00:08:28,235
the hybrid quantum classical workflows.

114
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:33,910
We obviously would optimize task
delegation and data flows, and the

115
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:39,130
system would scale at a enterprise
wide, and we would be monitoring

116
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,380
feedback loops for continuous tuning.

117
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:48,270
So this roadmap enables gradual low
risk adoption with incremental gains.

118
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,470
Let's talk about some of the
cross-industry applications mentioned

119
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,040
here in the autonomous vehicle domain.

120
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:00,730
We can get quantum to make the
sensor fusion faster by 2.7 times.

121
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,700
There is a 58% less power usage, which
would be beneficial in the longer

122
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,500
range and a better path planning
and real time decision making.

123
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,430
With smart cities, we have seen a 43%
reduction in traffic congestion and

124
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:21,460
a 30, even seven, 37% improvement in
energy efficiency, which also helps

125
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,010
in faster emergency response time.

126
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:29,350
In the industrial iot domain we
have seen a 67% drop in downtime.

127
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:36,990
Via productive maintenance, there is an
82% more efficient production scheduling.

128
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:42,680
So overall, we can see that
the enhanced edge AI is not

129
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,680
specific, it's to the industry.

130
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,075
It's also transformational across sectors.

131
00:09:48,575 --> 00:09:49,610
Lemme go through.

132
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:55,010
Let's look at some of the future research
directions that we can see like here.

133
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,360
So first is the quantum
hardware that we have to get to.

134
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:05,750
So we do need a domain specific, hardware
for these particular edge devices.

135
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:10,350
We also see a distributed quantum
processing especially like a

136
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:15,740
quantum cloud in the edge, and then
we have quantum neural networks.

137
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:21,140
Now, this is an entirely new AI
paradigm that has to be looked upon too.

138
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,085
Now these developments could
multiply today's gains exponentially.

139
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:30,515
Even now we are seeing that this
is just a tip of the iceberg.

140
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:33,955
This is a long-term
technological revolution.

141
00:10:34,455 --> 00:10:38,275
So thank you for listening
to my presentation about the

142
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:40,275
quantum enhanced edge ai.

Articles on edge.

146
00:10:51,395 --> 00:10:52,805
Thank you and have a nice day.
