8
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:30,215
Let's dive in.

9
00:00:30,715 --> 00:00:33,265
Here is what we will be
covering in today's session.

10
00:00:33,735 --> 00:00:37,405
We will start with an introduction
to why performance optimization

11
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:39,004
is crucial for IoT apps.

12
00:00:39,515 --> 00:00:43,785
Next, we will dive into specific
optimization strategies, starting with

13
00:00:43,815 --> 00:00:48,375
asynchronous performance, followed
by battery and memory optimization.

14
00:00:49,045 --> 00:00:53,745
We will also look at reducing app size
to make it lightweight, along with tips

15
00:00:53,745 --> 00:00:56,004
for optimizing database interactions.

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,010
Towards the end, I will introduce
some essential tools and

17
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:04,180
metrics to help you profile and
monitor your app's performance.

18
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,720
Let's get started.

19
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,590
Let's start by exploring why
performance optimization is so

20
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,020
critical in the context of IoT apps.

21
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,550
First, app performance directly
impacts user experience.

22
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,735
Users expect IoT apps to be
fast, Responsive and reliable.

23
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:26,945
Poor performance can lead to
dissatisfaction and may lead

24
00:01:26,965 --> 00:01:28,705
users to abandon the app.

25
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:33,625
IoT apps come with unique challenges,
including the need to handle real

26
00:01:33,655 --> 00:01:38,085
time data, operate on resource
constrained devices, and adapt to a

27
00:01:38,095 --> 00:01:39,895
wide range of hardware environments.

28
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,770
The goal of optimization is to overcome
these challenges and create apps that

29
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,250
are fast, efficient, and dependable.

30
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,670
Let's begin with one of the
most foundational elements of

31
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,320
optimization, asynchronous performance.

32
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,510
In the IoT world, apps often
need to handle real time data

33
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:02,700
processing, continuous device
communication, and background tasks,

34
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,670
all without freezing or lagging.

35
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:09,215
To achieve this, we must ensure
that heavy operations don't

36
00:02:09,215 --> 00:02:12,975
block the main thread, which is
responsible for the user interface.

37
00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:17,125
Kotlin coroutines offers a modern
and efficient way to handle

38
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:19,455
asynchronous programming in Android.

39
00:02:20,095 --> 00:02:23,605
They provide constructs like launch
for background tasks and async

40
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:27,365
for concurrent operations with
structured concurrency, making the

41
00:02:27,385 --> 00:02:29,705
code more readable and manageable.

42
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,230
For long running tasks, WorkManager
is an excellent solution.

43
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,900
It ensures tasks like data
synchronization or periodic updates

44
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,960
run without any problems, even if
the app is closed or device restarts.

45
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,449
This is particularly useful in IoT
apps where periodic communication

46
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,300
with devices or server is common.

47
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,700
Always profile your app using
tools like Android Profiler to

48
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,110
identify any inefficiencies or
bottlenecks in threat usage.

49
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:04,579
Lastly, remember that not all
operations need to be async.

50
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:06,129
Balance is key.

51
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,230
Operations that are quick and won't block
the main thread can remain synchronous

52
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,780
to avoid unnecessary complexity.

53
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,380
It is very important to ensure that
apps not drain the device battery.

54
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,840
Let's look at how we can
optimize battery performance.

55
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,570
First, managing background
tasks effectively is key.

56
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,210
Instead of constantly running tasks, use
Android's job scheduler or work manager.

57
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:36,369
These APIs help you schedule tasks
intelligently based on system

58
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,770
conditions like network availability
or battery levels, ensuring

59
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,500
minimal impact on battery life.

60
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:49,100
Next, sensor and GPS usage is a common
culprit for battery drain in IoT apps.

61
00:03:49,645 --> 00:03:54,675
To optimize batch sensor data to
minimize device wakeups and choose coarse

62
00:03:54,675 --> 00:04:00,005
location for tasks where high accuracy
isn't necessary, such as geofencing.

63
00:04:00,895 --> 00:04:05,715
By combining these strategies, we can
design IoT apps that provide excellent

64
00:04:05,715 --> 00:04:09,745
functionality while respecting the
device limited battery resource.

65
00:04:10,245 --> 00:04:13,485
Memory management is another
critical factor in maintaining

66
00:04:13,485 --> 00:04:18,055
smooth app performance, especially
in data intensive IoT applications.

67
00:04:18,595 --> 00:04:19,685
Let's dive into that.

68
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,340
Poor memory management can lead
to issues like lagging, freezing,

69
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,420
or even crashes, especially on
resource constrained devices.

70
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:32,640
Let's break down the challenges and
how to address them effectively.

71
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,330
First, let's talk about the challenge
of high data throughput in IoT.

72
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:42,820
IoT apps constantly receive and process
data from devices, which can quickly

73
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,800
exhaust memory if not managed efficiently.

74
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,290
This is compounded by the fact that
many IoT apps require frequent updates,

75
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,500
further increasing the load on memory.

76
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,020
To address these challenges, start by
using weak references where appropriate.

77
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,050
Weak references can help to
ensure objects are garbage

78
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,720
collected when no longer needed.

79
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,910
This prevents memory leaks.

80
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,410
Next, You need to actively
monitor your app's heap usage.

81
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,410
Tools like LeakHandlery
are invaluable here.

82
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,060
LeakHandlery can automatically
detect and report memory leaks during

83
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:24,610
development, making it easier to identify
problematic code and fix before release.

84
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,660
Another effective optimization strategy
is to implement object pooling.

85
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,620
For objects that are frequently
created and discarded, like temporary

86
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,800
data containers or UI components.

87
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:40,895
object pooling can help to
reduce the overhead of memory

88
00:05:40,895 --> 00:05:42,695
allocation and garbage collection.

89
00:05:43,535 --> 00:05:47,495
In summary, efficient memory
management ensures that your IoT

90
00:05:47,534 --> 00:05:52,665
app runs smoothly even under heavy
data loads and frequent updates.

91
00:05:53,165 --> 00:05:57,905
Reducing app size is especially
important for IoT devices as many of

92
00:05:57,955 --> 00:05:59,995
these devices have limited storage.

93
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:03,115
To achieve this, let's
look at a few techniques.

94
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:08,705
First, enable ProGuard or R8 for
code shrinking and optimization.

95
00:06:09,165 --> 00:06:14,015
These tools help to remove unused
code, classes, and methods from your

96
00:06:14,035 --> 00:06:16,765
app, reducing its size significantly.

97
00:06:17,465 --> 00:06:19,555
Next, use Android App Bundle.

98
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:24,145
This format allows the Play Store
to deliver only the code and

99
00:06:24,155 --> 00:06:28,755
resources required for a specific
device configuration, such as screen

100
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,575
size, language, or architecture.

101
00:06:31,075 --> 00:06:35,185
Another crucial technique is to
compress and optimize media assets.

102
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:40,365
For instance, resize and compress
images without sacrificing quality

103
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:45,370
using tools like TinyPNG, or
choose modern formats like Buffy.

104
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:51,340
Finally, use the APK Analyzer tool in
Android Studio to identify and analyze

105
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,150
the largest contributors to your app size.

106
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:59,590
By implementing these techniques, you
can create lightweight IoT apps that are

107
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:05,550
easier to download, install, and run on a
variety of devices, ultimately improving

108
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,860
user experience and accessibility.

109
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,370
Let's move on to the database
performance optimization.

110
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:17,080
Efficient database performance is a
cornerstone of a high performing IoT app.

111
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,830
Databases in IoT apps often face
common bottlenecks, such as frequent

112
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,170
read and write operations due
to the need for real time data

113
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,510
synchronization with IoT devices.

114
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,160
To tackle these challenges, let's
explore some optimization techniques.

115
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:37,090
First, use Room, Android's
recommended database library.

116
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,660
which abstracts XULite and
provide robust and easy to use

117
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,940
framework for database operations.

118
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,700
With Room, you can implement proper
indexing on frequently queried columns,

119
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,890
indexing speed up data retrieval.

120
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:56,350
Second, for scenarios where large
data sets needs to be displayed

121
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,390
or processed, pagination.

122
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,770
Finally, for frequently accessed data
that doesn't change often, consider

123
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,890
preloading it into memory where feasible.

124
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,700
Now let's explore the tools and
metrics that can help you monitor

125
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,480
