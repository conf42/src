00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,130
Hello and welcome to Con 42,
incident Management 2025.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,790
I'm Pri Dewa, a senior frontend engineer
at ThoughtSpot, where I've spent the last

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:15,190
several years working on complex data
visualizations and analytics product.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,815
My work is all about one thing,
taking overwhelming amount of data

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,920
and presenting it in a way that's
meaningful, timely, and actionable.

6
00:00:27,835 --> 00:00:34,015
And if there's one area where that
matters most, it's incident response

7
00:00:34,495 --> 00:00:40,405
because when something breaks, and
it always does, every minute counts.

8
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:45,765
In this talk, we'll explore
what ai, how AI is reshaping

9
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:47,835
the way we respond to incidents.

10
00:00:48,735 --> 00:00:54,435
We'll cover why static dashboards are
failing us, what AI powered visual

11
00:00:54,435 --> 00:00:56,265
intelligence brings to the table.

12
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:02,385
Which key technologies make this
possible and practical approach for

13
00:01:02,385 --> 00:01:05,175
implementing this in your organization?

14
00:01:05,675 --> 00:01:09,835
And as you listen, I invite
you to think about the last

15
00:01:09,835 --> 00:01:12,565
major incident your team faced.

16
00:01:13,065 --> 00:01:15,735
How much time did you spend
finding the right data?

17
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:18,425
How many dashboards did you click through?

18
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:23,155
How many times did someone say,
wait, let me check another system.

19
00:01:23,655 --> 00:01:30,315
By the end of the talk, I want you to
have a mental picture of what a future

20
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:36,135
intelligent AI powered incident response
workflow could look like for you.

21
00:01:36,635 --> 00:01:38,435
Let's set the stage.

22
00:01:39,335 --> 00:01:44,285
Today's incident response teams
are working in highly distributed

23
00:01:44,795 --> 00:01:46,475
and highly complex systems.

24
00:01:46,975 --> 00:01:52,225
These are, there are dozens or
hundreds of microservices, cloud

25
00:01:52,225 --> 00:01:57,324
infrastructure, spanning regions,
and data streaming from everywhere.

26
00:01:57,824 --> 00:02:02,414
When an incident hits, the flood
of information is enormous.

27
00:02:02,984 --> 00:02:09,225
Logs, races, alerts, status
pages, support tickets, and yet.

28
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:14,799
The tools we rely on are
still fundamentally reactive.

29
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:18,149
They tell us what happened after the fact.

30
00:02:18,899 --> 00:02:26,069
That means team spend the first critical
minutes just figuring out what's broken,

31
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:29,969
who is impacted, and where to look next.

32
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:35,329
We've all been there bridge calls
where five people are looking

33
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:37,489
at five different dashboards.

34
00:02:38,434 --> 00:02:43,894
Cross-referencing time ranges
trying to line up events manually.

35
00:02:44,224 --> 00:02:51,274
Meanwhile, customers are feeling the pain
and executives are asking for updates.

36
00:02:51,774 --> 00:02:56,714
This reactive approach doesn't just
deal a resolution, it's costly.

37
00:02:57,214 --> 00:03:03,214
Research shows downtime costs can
easily exceed $5,000 per minute,

38
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:09,964
sometimes far more in high volume
businesses like E-commerce or FinTech.

39
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:14,304
So this isn't just an
engineering challenge, it's

40
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,315
business continuity challenge.

41
00:03:17,154 --> 00:03:21,714
We need to stop playing, catch
up and get ahead of incidents.

42
00:03:22,214 --> 00:03:26,824
One of the reasons this is so
hard is the scale and speed

43
00:03:26,824 --> 00:03:28,384
of data we deal with today.

44
00:03:28,884 --> 00:03:33,894
Enterprise systems generate
massive streams of telemetry

45
00:03:34,224 --> 00:03:37,704
logs and metrics every second.

46
00:03:38,204 --> 00:03:41,744
If you think about observability
as drinking from a fire

47
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:44,119
hose, we have now connected.

48
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:49,709
And fire hoses and turn
them all on at once.

49
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,959
Traditional tools weren't built to
process this volume in real time.

50
00:03:55,459 --> 00:04:01,099
They sample data, they add latency,
they create blind spots, which

51
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:05,839
is the last thing you want when
you're in a high severity incident.

52
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:08,739
And then we have inflammation silos.

53
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:15,280
Logging in on one tool metrics and
another deployment history somewhere

54
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,010
else to piece together what happened.

55
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:24,280
Responders are forced to swivel between
systems and manually chlorate close.

56
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,080
This leads to context loss and delays.

57
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:34,320
The incident clock keeps ticking and
we are still just gathering evidence.

58
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,979
Let's talk about dashboards.

59
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:42,679
Dashboards were a huge leap forward
when they became mainstream.

60
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:49,099
They gave teams a way to visualize data
trends and quickly share information,

61
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,950
but they were designed for monitoring,
not for rapid crisis response.

62
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:57,979
They are reactive by design.

63
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:02,809
They show historical data and
force you to reconstruct the

64
00:05:02,809 --> 00:05:04,699
current state from the past.

65
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:08,659
They also create cognitive overload.

66
00:05:09,499 --> 00:05:15,349
Imagine 20 different charts
all updating every few seconds.

67
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,020
Your brain is trying to figure out
what changed first, which metrics

68
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,659
matter most, and whether it's a
system or a symptom or a root cause.

69
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:29,650
They require manual analysis.

70
00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:37,180
Someone has to click filters, adjust
time, windows, pull in additional context.

71
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,860
That manual effort slows everything
down and leaves room for human error

72
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,370
Exactly when you can least afford it.

73
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,940
So how do we fix this?

74
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,055
This is where AI powered
visual intelligence comes in.

75
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:59,955
Instead of simply showing you all
the data, the systems interpret it.

76
00:06:00,615 --> 00:06:07,035
They adapt dynamically as conditions
change, they don't just display anomalies,

77
00:06:07,305 --> 00:06:13,995
they correlate them group related alerts,
and even suggest likely root causes.

78
00:06:14,495 --> 00:06:19,325
Think of it as going from static
maps to a GPS navigation system.

79
00:06:19,825 --> 00:06:20,935
A map tell you.

80
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:23,215
MAP tells you where the roads are.

81
00:06:23,715 --> 00:06:28,949
A GPS guides you, reroutes you when
traffic builds up and helps you

82
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:30,989
get to your destination faster.

83
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:36,089
That's the leap AI enables
for incident response.

84
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:41,389
Moving from passive dashboards to
active context aware assistance

85
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:44,029
that work for you to resolve issues.

86
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:49,089
Let's break this down in three key
capabilities that make this work.

87
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:53,529
First, intelligent, alert, prioritization.

88
00:06:54,489 --> 00:07:00,879
AI learns from historical incidents
and create context to reduce and focus

89
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,764
your attention on what's most critical.

90
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:10,614
Instead of triaging 500 alerts
manually, you get a rank list

91
00:07:10,614 --> 00:07:13,254
of the five that matter most.

92
00:07:13,754 --> 00:07:17,114
Second, automated visual recommendations.

93
00:07:17,924 --> 00:07:23,054
The system picks the right way to
display data for the problems at hand.

94
00:07:23,554 --> 00:07:25,984
For example, during a network outage.

95
00:07:26,484 --> 00:07:33,114
It might autogenerate a topology map
showing the affected nodes in red, helping

96
00:07:33,114 --> 00:07:35,814
you see the blast radius instantly.

97
00:07:36,314 --> 00:07:38,205
Third, contextual summaries.

98
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:43,810
This is where natural language
processing shines complex technical

99
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:49,805
data gets turned into plain language
incident summary that can be shared

100
00:07:49,805 --> 00:07:52,775
with stakeholders saving responders.

101
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:58,159
From spending 15 minutes writing
status updates every hour.

102
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:01,690
Now let's reimagine this in action.

103
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:07,890
You open your incident dashboard and
instead of same static layout, it

104
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,130
reconfigures itself in real time.

105
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:15,220
The most relevant matrix
bubbles to the top related

106
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,079
anomalies are grouped together.

107
00:08:17,905 --> 00:08:22,195
Probable root causes are
highlighted with confidence scores.

108
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:29,485
Meanwhile, predictive models are scanning
the telemetry and warning you of possible

109
00:08:29,545 --> 00:08:36,025
cascading failures, giving you a window
to act before the instant spreads.

110
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:40,560
This terms the instant response
from forensic exercise to a

111
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,620
guided and proactive process.

112
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,220
And this is just the beginning.

113
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:53,960
The future is multimodal where responders
can use voice command or natural

114
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,210
language queries to interact with data.

115
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:01,900
Imagine saying, show me all error
spikes for the checkout service

116
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:08,170
in the last 30 minutes, and having
the dashboard instantly update.

117
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:14,700
We'll see AR overlays for physical
infrastructure inspections and

118
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,480
collaborative interfaces where
multiple teams can explore

119
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,000
data together in real time.

120
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,550
But the most powerful part
is ai, human collaboration.

121
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,855
AI handles the data crunching at scale.

122
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:35,300
Human focus on judgment,
communication, and decision making

123
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,850
together, they close the loop much
faster than either could alone.

124
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,370
How do you get from where you
are today to this future state?

125
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,730
Start with assessment and planning.

126
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:54,570
Measure meantime, measure your meantime
to detection, mean time to resolution, and

127
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,030
number of hands off during an incident.

128
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,300
Then focus on data integration.

129
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:07,590
Build unified pipelines that feed logs,
metrics, and alerts into a single system.

130
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,360
Without this foundation, AI
won't have a complete picture.

131
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,650
Next, move to AI model development.

132
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:21,340
Train your models on historical incident
so that they can recognize familiar

133
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:26,860
failure patterns, predict next likely
next steps, and suggest actions.

134
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:33,820
Then prioritize interface design the
interfaces where value becomes real.

135
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:40,360
It should be intuitive, role-based,
and designed for stressful situations.

136
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:46,885
Your SREs should get a deep
technical detail while executives

137
00:10:46,885 --> 00:10:49,105
see business impact summaries.

138
00:10:49,825 --> 00:10:52,555
Finally, build on continuous learning.

139
00:10:53,455 --> 00:10:58,825
Every incident is a chance to improve
your model and your workflows.

140
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:04,675
Treat the AI like any other
team member one who gets smarter

141
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,205
with every retrospective.

142
00:11:06,705 --> 00:11:10,395
And of course, implementing
this is and without challenges,

143
00:11:11,085 --> 00:11:12,885
you'll need to address data.

144
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,955
Address data quality first.

145
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:20,025
AI models are only as good
as the data you feed them.

146
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:25,985
Invest and standardize logging
practices, consistent naming conventions

147
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:29,405
and validation pipelines, then.

148
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:35,420
Think about team training responders
need to understand what the AI is

149
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,930
suggesting and trust its recommendation.

150
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:46,040
Start with a shadow mode where AI provides
recommendations alongside human decisions

151
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,565
so team can compare and build confidence.

152
00:11:50,065 --> 00:11:52,345
Lastly, don't forget change management.

153
00:11:52,975 --> 00:11:58,275
Rolling out a system like this is as
much a cultural change As a technical

154
00:11:58,275 --> 00:12:05,715
one, communicate benefits clearly involve
incident commanders early and roll out

155
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,495
gradually to avoid overwhelming the team.

156
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,435
Scalability is critical.

157
00:12:11,185 --> 00:12:14,965
Your architecture should be
cloud native so it can scale

158
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,755
elastically during major incidents.

159
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:26,365
Use microservice for modularity and
stream data in real time to keep insights

160
00:12:26,365 --> 00:12:33,415
fresh and invest in a visualization
layer that stays fast under load.

161
00:12:34,195 --> 00:12:40,345
Because nothing's worse than a dashboard
that freezes when everything is on fire.

162
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:44,265
Once implemented, measure
the results carefully.

163
00:12:44,835 --> 00:12:50,565
Track response time, metrics,
meantime to detection, meantime

164
00:12:50,565 --> 00:12:56,265
to recovery, and compare them
before and after the deployment.

165
00:12:57,255 --> 00:12:59,235
Measure analyst productivity.

166
00:12:59,735 --> 00:13:05,225
How many incidents each responders
can handle, and whether manual

167
00:13:05,225 --> 00:13:07,205
correlation steps are decreasing.

168
00:13:07,705 --> 00:13:13,165
Quantify the business impact dollars
saved from reduced time, customer

169
00:13:13,165 --> 00:13:15,805
churn, prevented and revenue protected.

170
00:13:16,555 --> 00:13:19,105
And don't forget the user experience.

171
00:13:19,885 --> 00:13:21,565
Our responders happier.

172
00:13:22,065 --> 00:13:23,415
Do they trust the system?

173
00:13:24,045 --> 00:13:27,285
Are executives more confident
in incident communication?

174
00:13:27,785 --> 00:13:32,345
That is how you prove the AI powered
incident intelligence isn't just

175
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:36,755
nice to have, it's a measurable
driver of business resilience.

176
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,300
So let's summarize.

177
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:44,420
Transform your approach beyond reactive
dashboards to proactive intelligent

178
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,240
interfaces that guide your response.

179
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:53,600
Invest in intelligence, build or
adopt AI capabilities that prioritize

180
00:13:53,660 --> 00:14:00,650
alerts, surface context, and recommend
actions enable your teams, give

181
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:04,985
responders training and tools to
trust these systems effectively.

182
00:14:05,485 --> 00:14:10,465
The future of incident response is
intelligent, adaptive, and human

183
00:14:10,465 --> 00:14:14,875
centered, and the sooner we start
this transformation, the more

184
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:19,615
resilient, proactive, and calmer
incident response process will become.

185
00:14:20,115 --> 00:14:22,485
I'd love for you to
reflect on one question.

186
00:14:23,205 --> 00:14:27,585
If your next P one incident happened
tomorrow, what would you want your

187
00:14:27,585 --> 00:14:29,835
AI power dashboard to show you first?

188
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:30,645
Thank you.
