1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,190
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,964 --> 00:00:05,205
Welcome to this Conf42 Prompt
Engineering Conference.

3
00:00:05,324 --> 00:00:10,225
And even more welcome to my session
topic on exploring co pilot capabilities.

4
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:15,475
Now, for today, we have, about 45 minutes
presentation time, where I'm going

5
00:00:15,475 --> 00:00:19,285
to try and show you quite some demos
to keep it a little bit entertaining.

6
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,585
Now, in short, although the main
topic of the conference is prompt

7
00:00:23,585 --> 00:00:27,565
engineering, I actually wanted to take
it one step further and talking about

8
00:00:27,575 --> 00:00:33,864
how to actually use prompt engineering
using Microsoft Copilot and not only

9
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:38,705
in like web or work like M365, but
actually giving you a walkthrough

10
00:00:38,735 --> 00:00:42,415
of what it different co pilots, are
available today within Microsoft.

11
00:00:43,155 --> 00:00:46,705
Now I'm going to start with a quick
overview, what generative AI is about.

12
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:50,155
Next to that, I'm going to zoom in a
little bit on, obviously, the prompt

13
00:00:50,155 --> 00:00:53,405
engineering, and then from there,
walking you through a couple of

14
00:00:53,485 --> 00:00:57,985
scenarios, where you already know, or
should know, that the ones I'm going to

15
00:00:57,985 --> 00:01:02,355
walk you through are not the only ones
available in, the Microsoft world today.

16
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:05,595
Now, before we're going to jump
into the technical details,

17
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:06,975
I'll share a bit about myself.

18
00:01:07,145 --> 00:01:11,325
So Peter De Tender, originally from
Belgium, but moved to Microsoft

19
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:13,965
Redmond close to three years ago.

20
00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:18,915
I've been working for Microsoft a bit
more than five years as a Microsoft

21
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:23,190
Technical Trainer, which means I'm
basically providing full day sessions,

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,530
sometimes full week sessions, workshops
on the Azure platform where my main

23
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,189
technology focus has always been Azure
architecting DevOps and in meantime,

24
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,360
app modernization using developing
on Azure as well as co pilot and AI.

25
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,010
If you should have any questions during
the conference, feel free to reach out.

26
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,380
If you're watching this later on
as a recording, nothing should

27
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,650
stop you from reaching out.

28
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,750
I got my LinkedIn details up here.

29
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,780
You can reach me on Twitter.

30
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,530
You can send me an email.

31
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,840
So now let's jump in and talk a
little bit about Generative AI.

32
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,070
So these are just a couple
of headlines from, a bit more

33
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,440
than a year ago, actually.

34
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:08,849
Where everything was around,
revolutionizing AI using the chat

35
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:11,380
GPT generative AI capabilities.

36
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,100
And there's a lot of headlines here,
but the main goal is that it's here.

37
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,810
Yes, a bit more than a year
ago, it was totally new.

38
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,770
Nobody really talked about it.

39
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:25,090
And I would say the
capabilities are crazy amazing.

40
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,760
And it's also a big part of
what I want to share today.

41
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:34,000
Now, giving you one easy example, this
is where, for example, I started using.

42
00:02:34,395 --> 00:02:38,795
A prompt to generate my bio picture,
like when I'm starting training, like

43
00:02:38,795 --> 00:02:42,625
every morning basically, or sometimes
like Monday morning in a multi day

44
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:47,355
class, then I need to talk a little
bit about my background, like building

45
00:02:47,355 --> 00:02:49,165
up credibility for the training.

46
00:02:49,665 --> 00:02:54,045
And that's where now I start playing
a little bit with prompt engineering.

47
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,220
To generate my bio picture.

48
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,100
Now, the thing is, how do
you get from your image into

49
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,730
a prompt engineer component?

50
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:09,800
So I'll walk you through the basics
where it should not be as harder as

51
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,940
what I'm going to try and show you.

52
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,500
If you look a little bit at this
picture, you're going to see that

53
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,030
there are a few different elements.

54
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,020
And I would say for me,
just as an example here.

55
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:23,555
What I would highlight
is, for example, Seattle.

56
00:03:24,055 --> 00:03:26,015
Now you know my roots, it's Belgium.

57
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:28,295
So you can see the Belgium flag up here.

58
00:03:28,795 --> 00:03:33,885
If we look at Peter himself, you can
detect a little bit of spiky hair.

59
00:03:34,385 --> 00:03:35,825
You can detect glasses.

60
00:03:36,325 --> 00:03:38,795
You can detect the hoodie
which I like to wear.

61
00:03:39,295 --> 00:03:41,115
You can detect the Microsoft logo

62
00:03:41,615 --> 00:03:43,565
and some sort of a laptop.

63
00:03:44,065 --> 00:03:48,405
Just looking at that picture and
recognizing the key components,

64
00:03:48,485 --> 00:03:50,455
that's all you need to build up.

65
00:03:50,995 --> 00:03:52,665
Your prompts, why?

66
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:58,095
Because if I move all this into some
few sample prompts actually used for

67
00:03:58,165 --> 00:04:03,095
generating those images, the first
one was cartoon man, Pixar style.

68
00:04:03,115 --> 00:04:06,715
So you can use, some already
existing, artistry, you could say.

69
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:11,725
But now the rest of my prompt across all
three is basically the same with a big

70
00:04:11,725 --> 00:04:16,875
smile wearing glasses, thin beard, dark
brown, short hair, gray hoodie, Microsoft

71
00:04:16,884 --> 00:04:21,505
logo, Surface laptop in the background,
show the Seattle skyline and the Belgian

72
00:04:21,505 --> 00:04:27,425
flag on top of it and just reusing
like 99 percent of the same prompt, but

73
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:29,115
then only making some minor changes.

74
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,570
Flipping from Pixar style to
Simpsons style to Marvel comic style.

75
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,680
That's how you're going to end up
with pretty cool and sometimes even

76
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,750
remarkable, impressive, outcomes of that.

77
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,890
Now that's the setting the
scene on prompt engineering.

78
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,490
Now in short, what is prompt engineering?

79
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,735
It's where, again, about a year
ago, The world was going crazy.

80
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:54,425
So again, just a few headlines here
from, reputable magazines and news,

81
00:04:54,915 --> 00:04:58,465
papers where I picked up like,
it's actually a pretty cool thing.

82
00:04:59,024 --> 00:05:03,274
So a lot of them literally talk about like
the first one here, rising significance

83
00:05:04,164 --> 00:05:07,695
in prompt engineering, or the other
one, the number one thing CEOs are

84
00:05:07,695 --> 00:05:10,345
investing in right now is, guess what?

85
00:05:10,385 --> 00:05:11,554
Generative AI.

86
00:05:11,635 --> 00:05:14,215
And then the last one here,
obviously the one that I like most

87
00:05:14,295 --> 00:05:16,564
is that thanks to generative AI.

88
00:05:17,005 --> 00:05:21,375
The AI job paying more than
300, 000 without having a

89
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,275
computer engineering background.

90
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:28,375
quite impressive, but is it all
really that important and that easy?

91
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,755
in short, what is prompt engineering?

92
00:05:31,045 --> 00:05:34,775
The first part in engineering is,
prompt engineering is the prompt.

93
00:05:35,005 --> 00:05:38,565
a prompt can be described as,
involving instructions, providing

94
00:05:38,565 --> 00:05:43,160
details, providing a context, Passing
it on to a large language model

95
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,230
and then achieving a desired task.

96
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,370
The second part is engineering.

97
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:51,850
When our engineering here
refers to developing, optimizing

98
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,539
prompts to efficiently again,
use that large language model.

99
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,040
Now, by the way, if you want to learn
more prompt engineering, I'm going

100
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,580
to give you another easy example.

101
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,070
Now, I would say prompt engineering
sounds a little bit wrong.

102
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,150
Now, why?

103
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,700
Because engineering sounds hard.

104
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,710
It sounds difficult.

105
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,910
And since not all of us are engineers,
it almost seems I'm not even able to

106
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,280
use that generative AI technology.

107
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,100
So that's why within Microsoft, we
actually like to use the term the

108
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,700
art of the prompt, or as I like
to describe it, prompt artistry.

109
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,210
Now, what does it mean?

110
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,480
You could grab like a tool of brushes,
you could grab some colors, you could

111
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,760
have a canvas, but that's no guarantee
to actually come up with a nice painting.

112
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,400
On the other side, prompt artistry
should not be all that hard, since in

113
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:47,010
the end, we have the natural language
concept, allowing us to assist with,

114
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,160
creating our prompts, but also using it.

115
00:06:50,555 --> 00:06:52,855
And in the end, you're
basically switching.

116
00:06:52,855 --> 00:06:54,565
And that's the part that I like about it.

117
00:06:55,085 --> 00:06:58,475
You're switching from
searching into finding.

118
00:06:59,105 --> 00:07:03,475
And the way to do that is basically
asking a series of questions.

119
00:07:03,885 --> 00:07:07,675
So moving this into a business context
that later on, I'll show you in

120
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:08,659
one of the demos, you'll see that.

121
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,070
A scenario could be something like this.

122
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,690
We have a goal in mind, which means
what do you want Copilot to do?

123
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,170
Next, it had the context,
like why do you need it?

124
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,560
who's going to be involved?

125
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,799
Apart from that, we have the source, where
later on we'll talk about web and work,

126
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,230
and eventually what are the expectations.

127
00:07:26,455 --> 00:07:31,385
So the example here could be, I
need to review, come up with details

128
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:33,225
about Microsoft Financial Report.

129
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:37,435
The context, I need it for a
meeting that I have next week with

130
00:07:37,515 --> 00:07:39,525
Microsoft executives, for example.

131
00:07:40,195 --> 00:07:44,344
The source could be web or work, which
means I'm going to use the trained

132
00:07:44,535 --> 00:07:48,795
language model information, like
public data that it's been trained

133
00:07:48,795 --> 00:07:54,220
on, Or, and that's specific to Copilot
in M365 that I'll share about, a lot

134
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:59,680
more later on, using your corporate,
Microsoft 365 backend data like

135
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,890
OneDrive, email, Teams, and SharePoint.

136
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,900
And from there, my expectation
is I don't need all the details,

137
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:10,740
but I want you to give me like a
summary in seven bullet points.

138
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:16,850
It's almost identical to approaching
Your colleague approaching the CFO,

139
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:20,750
maybe in this case, oh, could you
provide me like the Microsoft report?

140
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,520
But instead of giving you all the
details, you're gonna fine tune it,

141
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,750
you're gonna summarize it, and then the
actual prompt could be something like

142
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:33,700
this, where everything is now nicely
coming together in one larger prompt,

143
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,930
where the prompt, again, is technically
almost identical to just asking a question

144
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:44,730
in the, I dunno, human world without
using copilot to help you with that.

145
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,980
Now enough talking about it, I'm going
to switch to, my first demo here.

146
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,070
So what I'm using right now is copilot.

147
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:52,870
microsoft.

148
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,250
com.

149
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,640
So you open up your browser.

150
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,720
You connect to copilot.

151
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:58,430
microsoft.

152
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,269
com and it's going to ask you like,
Hey, how do you want to authenticate?

153
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,010
Do you want to use work?

154
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,959
So that's the difference web and work.

155
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,559
Or do you want to use a personal account?

156
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,930
Now I'm going to switch
to my other window.

157
00:09:11,445 --> 00:09:13,565
And actually trying to show you,

158
00:09:14,065 --> 00:09:17,025
there we go, what it looks
like in the personal space.

159
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,555
Now, this is what we
describe as unlicensed.

160
00:09:20,475 --> 00:09:25,834
So I'm authenticated with my
Peter at Google account, and I

161
00:09:25,855 --> 00:09:27,344
could ask basically any prompt.

162
00:09:27,405 --> 00:09:31,384
There's a few sample prompts on screen,
and I could do something like this.

163
00:09:31,884 --> 00:09:34,454
What, Oh, I already have it here.

164
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,884
So I'm, my roots, I'm from
Belgium, which means I like food.

165
00:09:37,974 --> 00:09:41,344
I like beer and preferably food
that has some sort of beer in

166
00:09:41,344 --> 00:09:43,324
it, which means, beef stew.

167
00:09:43,604 --> 00:09:46,664
So to come up with some
new ideas, I literally.

168
00:09:47,074 --> 00:09:47,964
Went for a prompt.

169
00:09:47,964 --> 00:09:49,174
I'll show you in a second.

170
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:50,924
I got beef stew meat.

171
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:53,504
Like I went to the store,
got me some beef stew meat.

172
00:09:53,574 --> 00:09:57,504
And can you just come up with
some ideas, share a few recipes.

173
00:09:57,904 --> 00:10:02,294
So without doing anything
specific or spectacular, it's

174
00:10:02,294 --> 00:10:03,334
now coming up with a recipe.

175
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:04,834
a couple of different recipes.

176
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:09,404
It shows me the ingredients and it also
provides me the actual instructions,

177
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,724
how to, start creating this.

178
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:16,704
Next to that, I could also do
something like, can you create an image

179
00:10:16,754 --> 00:10:20,664
showing a delicious beef stew meal?

180
00:10:20,734 --> 00:10:22,814
And that's what I could
maybe, for example.

181
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:26,909
Show to my wife later tonight
when she's back from work.

182
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:30,419
Back to our corporate environment.

183
00:10:30,469 --> 00:10:32,409
So the entry point is the same.

184
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,789
I'm using copilot.

185
00:10:33,989 --> 00:10:34,449
microsoft.

186
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:34,859
com.

187
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:40,069
We're now instead of using personal, I'm
going to switch to my work environment.

188
00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:45,609
What this is going to do is shifting
to what we now call biz chat.

189
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:47,589
So what is biz chat?

190
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:48,909
There's actually a short link.

191
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:50,749
M365.

192
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:51,159
cloud.

193
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:55,609
Microsoft, but that's a little bit
new, I would say because before

194
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:57,809
we all had to go to copilot.

195
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:58,429
microsoft.

196
00:10:58,569 --> 00:10:58,769
com.

197
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:04,859
I'm in my trusted M365 environment, where
now it means I can actually start finding

198
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:09,729
information, using information, and then
later on maybe editing my environment.

199
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:14,729
Now, before that, I'm going to switch
back to the presentation for a little bit.

200
00:11:15,229 --> 00:11:16,089
And talking about

201
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:19,009
all the other cool stuff inside Copilot.

202
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:20,979
Now, in short, what is Copilot?

203
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:26,759
Copilot is like a collection, you
could say, of different AI assistants.

204
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:32,659
Powered by the generative AI to help
you with what we call cognitive tasks.

205
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:36,559
Copilots are often driven
by natural language.

206
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:38,899
The large language model
that I already talked about.

207
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:42,679
Copilots are also embodied by a chatbot.

208
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:45,649
So that's what I showed you
in one of my first demos.

209
00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:48,569
Humans are still in control.

210
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:52,159
That's one of the amazing things
I like about the term co pilot

211
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:54,189
is that you're still the pilot.

212
00:11:54,369 --> 00:11:55,279
You're in charge.

213
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:59,389
You need to validate the answers and
you're going to decide eventually what

214
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:00,939
part of it that you're going to use.

215
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:05,929
Now, the main value I would also say
is really depending on what kind of

216
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:09,939
tasks are you performing and I'll walk
you through a couple of demos on that.

217
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:10,779
that later on.

218
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,409
Now we describe it as
the era of co pilots.

219
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,389
Now what does it mean?

220
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:21,679
Think of co pilot as that well trained,
well aware, up to date, real time

221
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,699
collaborator for basically anything.

222
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,999
So it allows you to generate content.

223
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:30,939
It allows you to literally put
Become that assistant if you

224
00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:33,029
want one of the building blocks.

225
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:35,239
By the way, I didn't
mention in that overview.

226
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:39,289
what is a good prompt is a persona
and I'll show you that in a demo

227
00:12:39,289 --> 00:12:43,009
later on where you could now
go Hey, co pilot, you're acting

228
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,329
as an Azure technical trainer.

229
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,394
And you can only answer
Azure technical questions.

230
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:52,374
If there's any question coming up
about, how to prepare beef stew, you

231
00:12:52,374 --> 00:12:54,944
won't be able to, answer that prompt.

232
00:12:55,504 --> 00:13:00,014
Or, obviously, flipping it around,
like your, I don't know, 15 year

233
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:04,394
experienced, I don't know, high quality
Michelin star alike restaurant chef.

234
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:08,634
You've been managing the kitchen for
15 years and I want you to come up with

235
00:13:08,684 --> 00:13:10,474
a delicious meal, recipe and so on.

236
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:13,714
But you do not know anything
outside of the kitchen.

237
00:13:13,804 --> 00:13:14,424
Something like that.

238
00:13:14,574 --> 00:13:16,214
So that's another cool thing.

239
00:13:16,814 --> 00:13:19,074
So it's again back to our co pilots.

240
00:13:19,234 --> 00:13:21,174
So it's going to allow
you to generate content.

241
00:13:21,264 --> 00:13:24,174
It's going to allow you to
optimize your productivity.

242
00:13:24,574 --> 00:13:28,244
It's going to allow you to automate
your cognitive tasks and then

243
00:13:28,244 --> 00:13:32,464
eventually, helping you completing
your tasks in a more fun way.

244
00:13:33,174 --> 00:13:39,354
Now, although I called my topic copilot
capabilities, it's actually not even

245
00:13:39,384 --> 00:13:44,754
possible anymore to describe even the
basics of copilot or all different

246
00:13:44,764 --> 00:13:46,804
Microsoft copilots we have in meantime.

247
00:13:46,865 --> 00:13:57,994
I'm going to try and zoom in a
little bit on my screen here,

248
00:13:58,494 --> 00:14:02,304
but if we look at like the
capabilities, Peter is big over there,

249
00:14:03,164 --> 00:14:05,154
so I would say we have co pilot.

250
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:11,424
We have capability integrations for
developers for business applications.

251
00:14:11,444 --> 00:14:15,012
That would now be our dynamics
environment, and then we have, Modern

252
00:14:15,012 --> 00:14:20,492
work, so everything around Microsoft 365,
data and AI, that's the core of our AI

253
00:14:20,522 --> 00:14:26,322
solutions, still integrating with machine,
machine learning using the Azure platform.

254
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:30,482
In the browser, a little bit,
whoops, what I already showed you.

255
00:14:31,442 --> 00:14:34,742
And the main message here is,
there's a copilot for pretty much

256
00:14:34,852 --> 00:14:36,802
anything, for pretty much any user.

257
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:40,762
And that's what this slide is actually
trying to jump in every now and then.

258
00:14:41,537 --> 00:14:45,457
Maybe something wrong with the animations,
but this is a slide that I, a slide,

259
00:14:45,457 --> 00:14:47,937
sorry, that I personally like a lot.

260
00:14:48,577 --> 00:14:50,757
Why I call it the rooms of the house.

261
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:54,617
This could be your private environment,
obviously your apartment, your home,

262
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:59,197
where you could talk to your wife, your
partner, your kids, and stimulating them

263
00:14:59,197 --> 00:15:01,297
to use Copilot for pretty much anything.

264
00:15:01,662 --> 00:15:04,762
Now, obviously this is a little
bit more in the business context.

265
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:10,012
And what it means is again that we do
have copilots for pretty much any user.

266
00:15:10,572 --> 00:15:16,032
If you store corporate data inside
SharePoint, Teams, Outlook, which I

267
00:15:16,052 --> 00:15:19,722
think everyone is pretty much doing
in the Microsoft world, you're going

268
00:15:19,722 --> 00:15:22,262
to rely on copilot for Microsoft 365.

269
00:15:22,762 --> 00:15:26,012
If we look at the business part
of it, like where you're going to

270
00:15:26,022 --> 00:15:28,802
store business data, it might be.

271
00:15:28,997 --> 00:15:33,057
Co pilot for Dynamics, where
we're now covering solutions for

272
00:15:33,097 --> 00:15:35,617
HR sales teams, marketing teams.

273
00:15:35,657 --> 00:15:36,387
That's the idea.

274
00:15:36,887 --> 00:15:40,717
If you're a sysadmin, if you're
a data engineer, you're going

275
00:15:40,717 --> 00:15:45,987
to look into managing co pilot
integration using co pilot for Azure.

276
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:49,677
You have co pilot for security, co
pilot for Azure, where it's going

277
00:15:49,677 --> 00:15:53,557
to help you looking into your Azure
subscriptions, your Azure environments,

278
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:56,277
and providing you feedback like how are.

279
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:01,522
My service doing, can you help me creating
a new Azure template to do something?

280
00:16:01,532 --> 00:16:02,282
That's the idea.

281
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:06,112
If you're a developer, you're
going to focus on co pilot

282
00:16:06,112 --> 00:16:10,552
for GitHub or now, I think the
official term is GitHub co pilot.

283
00:16:10,672 --> 00:16:13,752
I'll walk you through that a little
bit later on, and then eventually

284
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:18,652
co pilot for anyone else where you
might go for power apps or co pilot

285
00:16:18,692 --> 00:16:21,872
studio, allowing basically any user.

286
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:26,477
to create their own custom copilots
outside of what's already available

287
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:28,677
here on screen as a capability.

288
00:16:29,177 --> 00:16:32,607
So from here, I'm going to walk you
through a few different examples.

289
00:16:32,797 --> 00:16:38,437
I'm going to start with Copilot 365, later
on GitHub Copilot, and then eventually

290
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:43,677
showing you apart from the capabilities,
I'm going to walk you of Copilot in M365,

291
00:16:43,747 --> 00:16:49,287
Copilot in GitHub, how you can actually
create your own Copilots, whether you're

292
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:51,567
a developer or just a traditional user.

293
00:16:52,017 --> 00:16:53,667
And hopefully that's
going to become clear.

294
00:16:54,277 --> 00:16:56,827
So the first piece is adopting Copilot.

295
00:16:57,007 --> 00:17:00,607
So imagine the story that I like
to use in this presentation is,

296
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,597
we started with generative AI.

297
00:17:02,597 --> 00:17:07,697
Maybe you looked into ChatGPT or
maybe, You're still using it today,

298
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:10,927
where now I'm going to try and
convince you that there are some

299
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:13,737
additional benefits in using M365.

300
00:17:14,427 --> 00:17:18,527
So my first wave here is adopting Copilot.

301
00:17:19,242 --> 00:17:23,622
We talked about the private space, the
unlicensed space, but I would say for

302
00:17:23,662 --> 00:17:28,982
corporate use, preferably you're going
to pay for that Copilot M365 license.

303
00:17:29,692 --> 00:17:32,062
I think roughly, but
not all that important.

304
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:34,172
Check with your Microsoft
account team, I would say.

305
00:17:34,452 --> 00:17:38,532
But I think on average, it's
around 30 per user per month.

306
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:41,742
Now you might think okay, Peter,
that's a quite a big investment

307
00:17:41,942 --> 00:17:44,412
for a larger organization.

308
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:46,112
So what's the gain?

309
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,312
First of all, you have access
to the large language model.

310
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:52,002
In web and work.

311
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:56,772
I showed you a super basic prompt,
give me some recipes, around beef stew

312
00:17:56,892 --> 00:18:00,352
in the private space, and I'm going
to show you the same prompt that, or

313
00:18:00,352 --> 00:18:04,292
similar prompt that I'm going to use
in the corporate space next to that.

314
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:08,282
It's going to allow you to use
generative content creation.

315
00:18:08,602 --> 00:18:13,472
You can use Copilot in M365
in all Office applications.

316
00:18:14,032 --> 00:18:18,372
In Word, in Excel, in PowerPoint,
in OneNote, Copilot pages,

317
00:18:18,402 --> 00:18:20,402
one of the newer capabilities.

318
00:18:21,022 --> 00:18:24,402
You can use it to find information,
you can use it to brainstorm an

319
00:18:24,402 --> 00:18:28,602
idea, and again, basically using
it as that well trained colleague.

320
00:18:28,602 --> 00:18:31,932
And then in the end,
optimizing productivity.

321
00:18:32,332 --> 00:18:35,092
So in short, how does it
work a little bit from like a

322
00:18:35,092 --> 00:18:37,072
helicopter architect perspective?

323
00:18:37,752 --> 00:18:39,452
You have the large language models.

324
00:18:39,562 --> 00:18:43,762
Copilot in 365 is using the GPT 4 model.

325
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:46,702
So one of the most up
to date trained models.

326
00:18:47,372 --> 00:18:52,572
It's going to hook into Microsoft
Graph, where Graph is the API

327
00:18:52,572 --> 00:18:58,262
integration that we're using to
present you data from Office 365.

328
00:18:58,472 --> 00:18:59,522
One drive, one machine.

329
00:19:00,512 --> 00:19:03,192
SharePoint, emails, and Teams.

330
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:08,552
Now, the other nice thing is that
although Copilot runs as a service,

331
00:19:08,622 --> 00:19:12,832
it's embedded in almost each and every
Office product in the meantime, but

332
00:19:12,832 --> 00:19:15,102
it's also respecting your security.

333
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:19,142
Which means that it's going to
run in your usual account mode.

334
00:19:19,662 --> 00:19:21,592
So your data is your data.

335
00:19:21,592 --> 00:19:25,802
We're not using it to train where
some other generative AI solutions are

336
00:19:25,802 --> 00:19:30,382
actually using your prompts to train the
models and they're using metadata from

337
00:19:30,382 --> 00:19:32,702
your content to again train the model.

338
00:19:33,222 --> 00:19:35,572
Within Copilot we're not doing that.

339
00:19:35,572 --> 00:19:40,782
So your data remains your data and it's
also respecting security boundaries.

340
00:19:41,282 --> 00:19:45,902
It's already mentioned integrated
in M365 applications, and you

341
00:19:45,902 --> 00:19:49,372
can also use it in the web what
I showed you in my previous demo.

342
00:19:50,372 --> 00:19:54,142
So that let's shift to, the next
demo here, where I'm going to

343
00:19:54,142 --> 00:19:58,722
go back to what we now describe
as the Co Pilot M365 BizChat.

344
00:19:59,222 --> 00:20:00,192
And that's over here.

345
00:20:00,517 --> 00:20:02,077
So I landed in copilot.

346
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:02,687
microsoft.

347
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:03,127
com.

348
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:04,177
Do you want to use personal?

349
00:20:04,177 --> 00:20:05,147
Do you want to use work?

350
00:20:05,227 --> 00:20:06,627
And we land here.

351
00:20:06,627 --> 00:20:10,707
A lot of different options you
can do, or you can use from here.

352
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:14,377
So it's going to try and help
you a bit with, sample prompts.

353
00:20:15,217 --> 00:20:19,097
The sample prompts here are actually,
coming and I'll show you that later on.

354
00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:22,127
From what we call co pilot lab.

355
00:20:22,627 --> 00:20:24,327
So if you do aka.

356
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:30,517
ms forward slash co pilot lab, it's
going to show you how, you can come

357
00:20:30,517 --> 00:20:32,717
up with what I call sample prompts.

358
00:20:32,717 --> 00:20:36,927
They've been created by the product
teams vetted by, the first wave of users

359
00:20:37,017 --> 00:20:39,057
and feedback from customers as well.

360
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:42,982
So for example, within the
corporate space, you might need

361
00:20:42,982 --> 00:20:44,822
help with preparing for a meeting.

362
00:20:45,352 --> 00:20:49,442
You might be looking for a file
type, or a document name that you

363
00:20:49,442 --> 00:20:53,552
remember from like a customer, but
you don't really know where to find

364
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:56,702
that document because it's somewhere
in your SharePoint, it's somewhere.

365
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,962
In your OneDrive, you know that
it's there, but you don't really

366
00:20:59,962 --> 00:21:01,492
know exactly where to find it.

367
00:21:01,652 --> 00:21:03,932
And that's where your
copilot is going to help you.

368
00:21:04,752 --> 00:21:08,412
So I'm going to go back to,
another sample idea here.

369
00:21:08,922 --> 00:21:14,402
Let's say in preparation
for my meeting, can you.

370
00:21:14,467 --> 00:21:18,705
I'm going to go ahead and list up the
latest Microsoft financial report.

371
00:21:18,705 --> 00:21:19,357
Now, before

372
00:21:19,857 --> 00:21:24,357
I'm going to run this, let me
talk a second about work and web.

373
00:21:24,747 --> 00:21:29,177
So thinking back about the previous
slide, I talked about the large language

374
00:21:29,197 --> 00:21:32,377
model using public trained data.

375
00:21:32,627 --> 00:21:33,997
That would be the web.

376
00:21:34,497 --> 00:21:41,127
We're now, if we switch to work, that's
where it's using your corporate M365.

377
00:21:41,627 --> 00:21:44,317
So depending on the task,
remember you're in control.

378
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:45,962
You need to think about where.

379
00:21:46,812 --> 00:21:49,002
Am I going to find the
information that I need?

380
00:21:49,622 --> 00:21:55,872
So if I use the web tab, for example, and
I'm going to run this prompt, what it's

381
00:21:55,872 --> 00:21:57,892
going to do is pulling up information.

382
00:21:58,152 --> 00:22:02,442
Again, this is not a hundred percent
real time, internet search, but it's

383
00:22:02,452 --> 00:22:07,712
providing me feedback based on what the
large language model has been trained on.

384
00:22:07,712 --> 00:22:11,942
Now it's going to provide me
here, some input, all good.

385
00:22:12,217 --> 00:22:16,147
And it's going to show me
the actual annual report.

386
00:22:16,237 --> 00:22:20,627
So that's another nice thing with Copilots
that it's going to show you not only

387
00:22:20,647 --> 00:22:25,407
the prompt feedback, the response, but
it actually also comes up with, the

388
00:22:25,407 --> 00:22:27,487
source where that information came from.

389
00:22:27,737 --> 00:22:28,747
So I could use.

390
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:32,157
Like the web page here, and
that's going to show me all the

391
00:22:32,157 --> 00:22:34,437
details and I can download it.

392
00:22:34,517 --> 00:22:36,187
And that's what I'll reuse later on.

393
00:22:37,157 --> 00:22:38,897
Now, the nice thing is here.

394
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:44,517
Like the sources are public web,
sorry, public internet pages.

395
00:22:45,277 --> 00:22:49,937
now, if I switch to work, what it
actually means now is that I'm going to

396
00:22:49,937 --> 00:22:55,487
use the same prompt, but this time it's
going to use internal corporate sources.

397
00:22:55,767 --> 00:23:00,467
SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams meetings,
for example, and it's typically also

398
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:05,627
providing more insights, more details
because it's closer to the employees.

399
00:23:06,157 --> 00:23:08,277
Now, the baseline scenario
is still the same.

400
00:23:09,017 --> 00:23:11,737
So it's going to give me the
details, but it's also pointing

401
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:14,327
to files that I have access to.

402
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:20,317
I can shift to Copilot in Word,
for example, where now this idea

403
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:24,777
is I downloaded that Microsoft
Financial Report and I can have

404
00:23:25,277 --> 00:23:27,197
Another integration with Copilot.

405
00:23:27,257 --> 00:23:29,637
There's actually two
different ways to use this.

406
00:23:30,097 --> 00:23:33,657
So one example is what
we call Copilot drafting.

407
00:23:34,377 --> 00:23:38,777
So whenever you're in a Word document,
in PowerPoint, in Excel, in OneNote,

408
00:23:38,937 --> 00:23:44,287
you're going to see this little
Copilot icon showing up over here.

409
00:23:44,787 --> 00:23:49,537
What it allows me to do is now using
Copilot generative AI capabilities

410
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:56,482
to help me with my document creation,
my document research, my Business

411
00:23:56,482 --> 00:23:58,462
idea, compilation and whatnot.

412
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:04,602
So I could do something like writing a
prompt back to the basics, where now I

413
00:24:04,602 --> 00:24:08,342
could do transform this into a table.

414
00:24:08,842 --> 00:24:12,812
The use case here is that maybe I
don't know how to do this in Word,

415
00:24:12,932 --> 00:24:17,472
but I like to find that information,
reuse it and move it into a table.

416
00:24:17,952 --> 00:24:19,742
That's what, again, what we call drafting.

417
00:24:19,742 --> 00:24:19,952
Why?

418
00:24:19,952 --> 00:24:20,402
Because.

419
00:24:20,832 --> 00:24:22,002
It's still a draft.

420
00:24:22,062 --> 00:24:25,772
I need to confirm keeping it or
I could go back to the prompt

421
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:27,692
and actually updating my prompt.

422
00:24:27,982 --> 00:24:29,532
I'm going to keep this change for now.

423
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:30,212
That's all fine.

424
00:24:31,187 --> 00:24:37,137
Now, another use case is using Copilot
to help me with my document, but

425
00:24:37,137 --> 00:24:40,997
this time I'm not really changing
anything in the document, but I'm

426
00:24:40,997 --> 00:24:42,457
going to take some other actions.

427
00:24:42,717 --> 00:24:48,337
Again, we do have our Copilot lab
based, sample prompts to get started.

428
00:24:48,797 --> 00:24:50,072
And if you want more.

429
00:24:50,902 --> 00:24:55,622
You can actually use this view prompt,
and it's going to show you the copilot

430
00:24:55,622 --> 00:25:00,812
lab vetted prompts from here based
on the task that you want to perform.

431
00:25:01,622 --> 00:25:05,662
The prompt scenarios are different
in Word, in PowerPoint, in Excel.

432
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:06,412
That's the idea.

433
00:25:07,212 --> 00:25:08,482
So there is a prompt here.

434
00:25:08,512 --> 00:25:12,252
Summarize this document
in X amount of points.

435
00:25:12,352 --> 00:25:16,302
Now, again, showing you that it's
understanding your natural language.

436
00:25:16,742 --> 00:25:19,922
You could do something
like, can you provide.

437
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:24,212
Need, key takeaways from this document.

438
00:25:24,212 --> 00:25:29,302
I don't need to add from this document
because I'm already inside the document.

439
00:25:29,982 --> 00:25:31,892
Now, I like this one.

440
00:25:31,892 --> 00:25:35,252
Key takeaways because it might
have a different connotation for

441
00:25:35,252 --> 00:25:37,212
basically, any different user.

442
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:41,572
If I'm in a financial report
and I would ask my CFO, can you

443
00:25:41,572 --> 00:25:42,892
provide me the key takeaways?

444
00:25:42,952 --> 00:25:47,192
The answer will be totally different
than if you would ask, one of your

445
00:25:47,192 --> 00:25:50,612
HR people, or if you would ask, like
in my case, a technical trainer.

446
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:53,137
Can you talk about
Microsoft Financial Report?

447
00:25:53,817 --> 00:25:56,497
The answer will probably
be slightly different.

448
00:25:57,327 --> 00:25:59,557
But even then, the core
concept remains the same.

449
00:25:59,727 --> 00:26:03,137
It's going to provide me the prompt
input, it's going to provide the response,

450
00:26:03,537 --> 00:26:05,967
and it's also providing me the source.

451
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:10,527
This time, no source on the
Internet, but it's a source within

452
00:26:10,627 --> 00:26:15,187
the Word document, and then jumping
across different paragraphs.

453
00:26:15,897 --> 00:26:20,202
Another cool example,
is inside PowerPoint.

454
00:26:20,352 --> 00:26:23,142
One of the things that we all have
to do, like creating PowerPoint

455
00:26:23,142 --> 00:26:25,082
decks for our presentations, right?

456
00:26:25,862 --> 00:26:30,972
Where I'm going to start from a
new presentation, where again, you

457
00:26:30,972 --> 00:26:36,132
can see up here, we do have Copilot
and here on the side again as well.

458
00:26:36,632 --> 00:26:39,682
The use case is again, slightly
different depending on again,

459
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,122
the task you want to perform.

460
00:26:41,512 --> 00:26:45,072
So I'm going to start the upper
one here, and it's going to offer

461
00:26:45,092 --> 00:26:49,662
me what we now call the CoPilot
PowerPoint Narrative Builder.

462
00:26:50,162 --> 00:26:51,742
Imagine my scenario here.

463
00:26:52,452 --> 00:26:56,792
If you paid attention to the pitch
at the start of the session, it's

464
00:26:56,792 --> 00:26:58,852
like making users more productive.

465
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:04,062
So the flow would typically be, doing
research, going to the internet,

466
00:27:04,062 --> 00:27:07,082
finding information, go to SharePoint,
OneDrive, anywhere on the planet.

467
00:27:07,437 --> 00:27:10,947
To find your information, you're
typically going to move that into a

468
00:27:10,947 --> 00:27:15,447
Word document and building up your flow,
or your story of your presentation.

469
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:19,177
And then eventually you're going to
move all that into PowerPoint slides.

470
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:22,677
All that can now be optimized
with one easy prompt.

471
00:27:22,837 --> 00:27:26,887
So I'm going to reuse the same prompt,
create a presentation about, and so on.

472
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:29,317
I'm using the exact same
prompt, copy pasting.

473
00:27:29,817 --> 00:27:32,147
And again, it's going
to use generative AI.

474
00:27:32,577 --> 00:27:38,177
To build up the layout of my
presentation based on the content,

475
00:27:38,217 --> 00:27:43,157
the actual headlines, the chapters,
if you want, within my financial

476
00:27:43,157 --> 00:27:47,787
report, based on the same generative
AI prompt that I used before.

477
00:27:48,557 --> 00:27:49,457
I still have.

478
00:27:49,957 --> 00:27:54,997
Co pilot integration, I could add
something at a topic about Azure AI.

479
00:27:55,497 --> 00:28:01,077
I could move my outline components
around, so I could move it up and

480
00:28:01,077 --> 00:28:06,177
down, and then eventually asking
to generate the actual content.

481
00:28:07,017 --> 00:28:11,897
What it's going to do here is starting
with the base outline, it's going

482
00:28:11,897 --> 00:28:13,157
to create the different slides.

483
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:17,737
Next to that, it's going to add It's
going to add all the different chapters

484
00:28:17,837 --> 00:28:23,327
and the last it's going to add content
where it's not just some minimal text,

485
00:28:23,377 --> 00:28:27,787
but it's actually providing full details,
adding images, adding bullet points.

486
00:28:28,337 --> 00:28:31,277
And on top of that, adding
speaker notes as well.

487
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:34,297
And all this in, again,
just a couple of minutes.

488
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:37,887
I did not edit this piece
of the presentation for

489
00:28:37,887 --> 00:28:39,017
the recording, by the way.

490
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,347
If I open up one of these slides.

491
00:28:42,312 --> 00:28:44,322
You can see that everything is there.

492
00:28:44,382 --> 00:28:48,532
The information is coming from
the prompt response and it's

493
00:28:48,542 --> 00:28:50,622
also providing the speaker notes.

494
00:28:51,322 --> 00:28:55,472
The other nice thing is from here,
if I go to co pilot on the site,

495
00:28:55,552 --> 00:28:57,932
remember I briefly talked about graph.

496
00:28:58,112 --> 00:29:03,762
So what I can do is add information
from forward slash and that's going

497
00:29:03,762 --> 00:29:06,442
to allow me to browse for files.

498
00:29:06,732 --> 00:29:11,857
Now here, if I want to add information
from Let's say a customer, or at least

499
00:29:11,857 --> 00:29:13,847
I know the topic of the presentation.

500
00:29:14,177 --> 00:29:20,637
I could do something like Contoso learn,
it's a sample customer I'm using here

501
00:29:21,207 --> 00:29:25,487
and adding some information from a
Word document from another PowerPoint,

502
00:29:25,947 --> 00:29:27,977
and it's getting nicely integrated.

503
00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:33,267
So that's, in short, what
our Copilot M365 is about.

504
00:29:33,767 --> 00:29:39,037
Next example is targeting, a little bit
more, what I would call the developer.

505
00:29:39,562 --> 00:29:44,762
Team within your organization, you have
GitHub copilot based on all the same

506
00:29:44,762 --> 00:29:48,862
concepts that I already talked about,
allowing you to not only document

507
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:54,212
code, analyzing code, writing code, but
also overall making your developers.

508
00:29:54,317 --> 00:29:58,497
more productive, similar
to traditional M365 users.

509
00:29:59,187 --> 00:30:03,777
So in short, what is Copilot for
GitHub or yes, I know GitHub Copilot,

510
00:30:03,837 --> 00:30:05,267
I think is the more common name.

511
00:30:05,267 --> 00:30:08,987
Now, you still have the large
language models on one end.

512
00:30:09,897 --> 00:30:13,867
In the middle, that's the integration
with your trusted developer environment.

513
00:30:14,332 --> 00:30:18,122
Visual Studio Code extensions, Visual
Studio JetBrains, and a few other

514
00:30:18,122 --> 00:30:24,072
environments, and then ultimately your
developer velocity, reducing technical

515
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:29,772
depth, integrating better code, reusing,
GitHub copilots to, for example, create

516
00:30:29,822 --> 00:30:33,732
documentation, something that typically
developers not always like to do,

517
00:30:34,152 --> 00:30:36,652
or why not, having a scenario where.

518
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:39,892
You might be the new
developer on the team.

519
00:30:40,492 --> 00:30:44,172
You need to jump into an already
existing project and you want to

520
00:30:44,172 --> 00:30:45,972
learn, what's actually happening there.

521
00:30:46,122 --> 00:30:49,522
So that's, a few examples that
I'm going to try and show you

522
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:52,252
in my next GitHub Copilot demo.

523
00:30:52,912 --> 00:30:55,982
So I'm using Visual Studio Code.

524
00:30:56,042 --> 00:31:02,382
This is a little sample app where it's
integrating some OpenAI services in Azure.

525
00:31:02,752 --> 00:31:07,672
And allowing me to transform, a
summary of a YouTube video into

526
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:09,072
three to five bullet points.

527
00:31:09,572 --> 00:31:12,622
If you want to get access to this
app, by the way, it's a bit off

528
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:18,452
topic, but I actually have it on my
GitHub, Repo, if you go to github.

529
00:31:18,452 --> 00:31:23,742
com slash P E tender, you're going to
find it as the YouTube, summarizer.

530
00:31:24,302 --> 00:31:27,422
It's not about the app, but just
showing you some capabilities

531
00:31:27,462 --> 00:31:28,922
that we have with Copilot.

532
00:31:29,402 --> 00:31:32,102
So the first example is
I'm jumping into this app.

533
00:31:32,152 --> 00:31:35,382
Maybe this is an app that like,
why not you clone from my GitHub

534
00:31:35,592 --> 00:31:38,332
repo and you go what's Peter doing?

535
00:31:38,692 --> 00:31:40,452
from the language perspective.

536
00:31:41,052 --> 00:31:45,092
So I could go into my copilot extension.

537
00:31:45,592 --> 00:31:50,392
I'm going to open it up and this is
from the previous run testing your

538
00:31:50,392 --> 00:31:51,892
demos is always a good thing, right?

539
00:31:52,482 --> 00:31:57,552
Where I'm literally using add workspace,
which means, Hey, get up copilot.

540
00:31:57,632 --> 00:32:02,232
I want you to look into this specific
application, not just this file, but

541
00:32:02,232 --> 00:32:07,392
everything around it, and provide an
explanation for the active selection.

542
00:32:07,697 --> 00:32:13,957
So I selected, a certain part of my
app code and asking for an explanation.

543
00:32:14,457 --> 00:32:19,847
What it's doing here is providing a pretty
detailed, pretty extensive, Description

544
00:32:20,487 --> 00:32:22,307
pointing to the different files.

545
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:26,667
So the same concept that I talked
about and showed you in web, in work,

546
00:32:26,717 --> 00:32:31,307
in my PowerPoint and Word documents,
is now the same for GitHub Copilot.

547
00:32:32,037 --> 00:32:36,577
Using language pro large language
model, translating, recognizing your

548
00:32:36,647 --> 00:32:40,507
super basic prompts, but you can
actually make it more powerful, and it's

549
00:32:40,507 --> 00:32:42,147
going to provide you an explanation.

550
00:32:42,647 --> 00:32:47,677
Another example that I have is, can
you add necessary code to integrate

551
00:32:47,677 --> 00:32:50,227
this app with Azure Key Vault?

552
00:32:50,497 --> 00:32:53,137
So it's again providing a description.

553
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:59,837
It's going to explain like I need these
nugget packages, and from there it's

554
00:32:59,837 --> 00:33:02,097
going to show you the new lines of code.

555
00:33:02,677 --> 00:33:04,217
But again, it's still a draft.

556
00:33:04,227 --> 00:33:07,907
So you need to decide okay, this
all looks good, and I'm going to

557
00:33:08,187 --> 00:33:10,887
insert it inside my application.

558
00:33:11,387 --> 00:33:14,827
I could go into my app settings.

559
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:19,697
I'm going to show you this live,
where now I could go back to my chat

560
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:25,437
window and document this code snippet.

561
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:29,747
And again, there are quite some pre built
keywords that you could use, like the

562
00:33:29,747 --> 00:33:31,957
ad workspace that I showed you before.

563
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:34,747
But on the other side, you
don't really have to use it.

564
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:38,717
because again, it's relying on
your, traditional natural language.

565
00:33:39,007 --> 00:33:40,557
Now you could go okay, Peter.

566
00:33:40,717 --> 00:33:42,267
I recognize this as JSON.

567
00:33:42,297 --> 00:33:46,827
I recognize your previous code,
which is like NET C sharp.

568
00:33:46,877 --> 00:33:48,867
But what if I'm a Java developer?

569
00:33:48,897 --> 00:33:50,427
What if I'm a Python developer?

570
00:33:50,787 --> 00:33:51,717
So I could go back.

571
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:57,067
I could select everything in here,
where now I could do something.

572
00:33:57,157 --> 00:34:01,927
Can you rewrite the C
sharp code into Python?

573
00:34:02,427 --> 00:34:06,867
And then in just a couple of seconds, it's
actually going to help you recognizing the

574
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:09,607
exact same syntax from your code pages.

575
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:12,567
And from there translating it into Python.

576
00:34:12,997 --> 00:34:16,057
I'm not going to apply it from here
because obviously it's just one

577
00:34:16,057 --> 00:34:20,437
easy example, but that's really
the power of GitHub Copilot.

578
00:34:20,962 --> 00:34:27,272
Using it to explain existing code, using
it to document code, using it to rewrite

579
00:34:27,272 --> 00:34:33,992
code and then maybe even using it to
find, optimizations to maybe rewrite full

580
00:34:33,992 --> 00:34:39,992
snippets of code and actually, or even
allowing you to maybe even migrating your,

581
00:34:40,132 --> 00:34:42,942
existing legacy code into newer language.

582
00:34:42,942 --> 00:34:43,392
But

583
00:34:43,892 --> 00:34:48,022
what if M365, what if web, what if.

584
00:34:48,522 --> 00:34:51,782
GitHub Copilot, I would say,
is still not good enough.

585
00:34:52,262 --> 00:34:56,292
That's where now you also have
the option to extend your own

586
00:34:56,622 --> 00:34:58,772
Git, extend your own Copilot.

587
00:34:59,572 --> 00:35:00,872
Two different scenarios.

588
00:35:00,922 --> 00:35:05,132
The first one I'm going to zoom in for
a couple of minutes is Copilot Studio.

589
00:35:05,912 --> 00:35:10,302
Using Copilot Studio, it's going to
allow you to, what we describe as a no

590
00:35:10,332 --> 00:35:15,907
code or low code, like injecting the
minimal experience as a developer, to

591
00:35:15,927 --> 00:35:18,377
actually create your custom co pilots.

592
00:35:18,927 --> 00:35:21,507
Everything I talked about
up to now is still valid.

593
00:35:21,867 --> 00:35:26,387
So it's allowing you to
customize co pilot in M365.

594
00:35:26,817 --> 00:35:31,077
An easy example, you want to add,
additional Teams integration.

595
00:35:31,127 --> 00:35:34,957
You want to add integration with
other corporate applications

596
00:35:35,047 --> 00:35:38,927
where you're going to read out
information from your corporate users.

597
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:42,787
find me emails from my manager
where you don't have to specify

598
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:46,647
the name, Of the manager based
on your organizational chart.

599
00:35:46,787 --> 00:35:49,487
It actually knows, who
your manager will be.

600
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:50,757
That's the scenario.

601
00:35:51,257 --> 00:35:55,387
Second one is integrating
specifically building from scratch.

602
00:35:55,397 --> 00:36:01,957
So not using extensions to M365, but
actually building your own custom copilot

603
00:36:01,957 --> 00:36:04,797
from scratch using copilot studio.

604
00:36:05,297 --> 00:36:07,587
You can imagine I got a
little demo coming up.

605
00:36:08,142 --> 00:36:10,162
How to use Copilot Studio.

606
00:36:10,662 --> 00:36:15,652
So the idea is that you
connect to copilotstudio.

607
00:36:15,732 --> 00:36:16,322
microsoft.

608
00:36:16,492 --> 00:36:16,772
com.

609
00:36:17,422 --> 00:36:19,892
You're going to authenticate, you
need the license, and from there

610
00:36:19,892 --> 00:36:24,112
you can start building, creating,
composing your app, although you don't

611
00:36:24,122 --> 00:36:25,932
really need to think as a developer.

612
00:36:26,502 --> 00:36:30,702
And there's a lot of examples
available, like a safe travel chat

613
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:35,722
function app, a website Q& A where
you can build up the flow of the

614
00:36:35,722 --> 00:36:37,042
prompts, that's the nice thing.

615
00:36:37,817 --> 00:36:43,767
store operations like optimizing,
retail, creating an IT helpdesk scenario,

616
00:36:43,837 --> 00:36:48,147
allowing your employees to find not
only answers, but actually helping

617
00:36:48,147 --> 00:36:53,647
them fixing issues, resolving issues,
and also helping in, in creating,

618
00:36:53,647 --> 00:36:55,857
but also reducing support tickets.

619
00:36:56,357 --> 00:36:59,537
There's links to documentation
and anything else from here.

620
00:36:59,977 --> 00:37:08,337
So let's say I switched to Copilots and I
already reused my, Safe Travels template.

621
00:37:09,267 --> 00:37:15,377
So what it's going to give me
here is a pretty step by step drag

622
00:37:15,457 --> 00:37:16,967
and drop, if you want, scenario.

623
00:37:17,577 --> 00:37:22,317
Allowing me to come up with my own
co pilot, defining the data backend.

624
00:37:22,387 --> 00:37:27,737
Like you can use information from our
corporate backend, or you can literally

625
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:30,397
provide the actual data set yourself.

626
00:37:30,807 --> 00:37:34,467
And then also helping the
users who start using the chat

627
00:37:34,497 --> 00:37:37,027
capabilities into your own scenario.

628
00:37:37,027 --> 00:37:41,336
I'm going to try and refresh
because it's not coming up.

629
00:37:41,376 --> 00:37:45,376
That's what happens when you do live
demos during recordings, But that's fine,

630
00:37:46,316 --> 00:37:52,256
I could show you how to create a new one
so you could build your own new co pilot.

631
00:37:52,476 --> 00:37:56,056
Let's say we're going to do IT Helpdesk.

632
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:57,426
Oh, bad example.

633
00:37:57,926 --> 00:37:59,426
Let's see what we already have.

634
00:37:59,466 --> 00:38:03,466
So that's the other thing where it's
not just about your M365 because

635
00:38:03,466 --> 00:38:04,976
then you would use that extension.

636
00:38:05,686 --> 00:38:09,316
But now you can interact with
third party applications.

637
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:14,331
Imagine you have this step by step
flow where you want to use data from

638
00:38:14,331 --> 00:38:17,921
Google Drive, you want integration
with DocuSign, you want to send

639
00:38:17,991 --> 00:38:20,131
Slack update messages and whatnot.

640
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:25,531
Think of it as building your own solution
using the same large language model

641
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:30,911
concepts, having that look and feel co
pilot experience, but now connecting

642
00:38:30,971 --> 00:38:33,481
to your specific corporate data.

643
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:39,401
And then the last piece here is Still
creating your own custom co pilots,

644
00:38:39,441 --> 00:38:44,441
but instead of relying on the power
apps based integration or the co pilot

645
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:49,731
low code no code scenario is now we
actually do have a team of developers

646
00:38:49,801 --> 00:38:52,231
and we want to build our own extensions.

647
00:38:52,381 --> 00:38:53,691
So what can we do there?

648
00:38:54,621 --> 00:38:57,911
The answer there would be Azure AI Studio.

649
00:38:58,371 --> 00:39:00,071
So what is Azure AI Studio?

650
00:39:00,181 --> 00:39:02,991
It's gonna, it's running on
top of the Azure platform.

651
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:05,421
You deploy Azure AI service.

652
00:39:05,731 --> 00:39:11,161
And a little differentiator here
is that it's not only relying on

653
00:39:11,861 --> 00:39:16,041
the chat GPT like GPT 4 models.

654
00:39:16,296 --> 00:39:20,636
But also allowing you to integrate
other language models besides OpenAI.

655
00:39:21,106 --> 00:39:23,916
So you can integrate Lama from Meta.

656
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:26,346
You can integrate, Phi from Microsoft.

657
00:39:26,346 --> 00:39:28,936
You can integrate Mistral
and a few other as well.

658
00:39:29,436 --> 00:39:32,866
Apart from deciding which language
models you're going to use.

659
00:39:33,266 --> 00:39:36,926
You can have an integration
with the chat playground.

660
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:41,036
You would typically use chat
playground to validate the outcome

661
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,796
of different large language models.

662
00:39:43,306 --> 00:39:46,386
And then from there, that's where
the actual development work comes in.

663
00:39:46,496 --> 00:39:48,606
You're going to use it
to fine tune the model.

664
00:39:48,646 --> 00:39:53,696
Maybe you're going to use Azure
AI Studio for custom development.

665
00:39:53,756 --> 00:39:58,466
So integrating a little bit what I showed
you in my YouTube summarizer example.

666
00:39:59,126 --> 00:40:01,716
I'm going to build a little
app, little web interface.

667
00:40:01,776 --> 00:40:03,616
I'm going to rely on AI Studio.

668
00:40:04,551 --> 00:40:10,861
And the Azure AI services to provide
me interaction with the AI APIs.

669
00:40:11,431 --> 00:40:14,621
And then maybe even going all
the way to the machine learning,

670
00:40:15,031 --> 00:40:19,831
starting point of AI eventually and
using it to train your own models.

671
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:24,371
So with that, I'm going to switch to
my last demo and showing you a little

672
00:40:24,371 --> 00:40:26,721
bit what AI Studio could look like.

673
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:29,901
So I deployed my AI service.

674
00:40:29,901 --> 00:40:35,921
So basically in the Azure portal,
you look for AI, Azure AI service.

675
00:40:36,421 --> 00:40:39,571
It takes a couple of minutes, and
from there, it's going to tell

676
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:42,151
you to navigate to AI Studio.

677
00:40:42,221 --> 00:40:46,091
And that's where I would say the
creation, the validation actually starts.

678
00:40:46,841 --> 00:40:51,501
I deployed two different models,
but I can show you a little bit

679
00:40:51,531 --> 00:40:53,541
what the model catalog looks like.

680
00:40:54,171 --> 00:40:55,141
So again, we have.

681
00:40:55,761 --> 00:41:02,761
Models from Cohere, Mistral, Meta, so the
LLAMA options are in here, GPT, so the

682
00:41:02,781 --> 00:41:05,521
OpenAI, and you can start mixing matching.

683
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:09,131
Obviously, depending on the use
case, the recommendation would be

684
00:41:09,131 --> 00:41:12,941
to use the specific model that you
want to use for your environment.

685
00:41:13,441 --> 00:41:17,911
Once your models have been deployed,
I have an example here with 3.

686
00:41:18,081 --> 00:41:19,671
5 Turbo and 4.

687
00:41:20,091 --> 00:41:24,631
The main difference, I would say,
is the lifespan of the data that

688
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:26,651
has been used to train the model.

689
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:32,481
An easy example to show you what I
mean by that is if we have a default

690
00:41:32,521 --> 00:41:34,301
prompt, who's the prime minister

691
00:41:34,801 --> 00:41:35,691
of the UK?

692
00:41:36,191 --> 00:41:37,421
Where based on GPT 3.

693
00:41:37,471 --> 00:41:44,121
5, as you can see here, it's going to
tell me, as of September 2021, that's

694
00:41:44,121 --> 00:41:48,071
basically the last up to date this 3.

695
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,921
5 model has been trained on,
it's going to provide the answer.

696
00:41:51,391 --> 00:41:52,561
But now if I switch to GPT 4.

697
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:58,891
0, that got published like earlier this
year, and using the same prompt, who

698
00:41:58,911 --> 00:42:04,501
is the Prime Minister of the UK, you're
going to see that based on the exact

699
00:42:04,501 --> 00:42:06,671
same prompt, the answer is different.

700
00:42:07,006 --> 00:42:12,426
Because now GPT 4 has been trained
up to October 2023, give or take.

701
00:42:13,116 --> 00:42:17,496
So that's how it could impact the
answers in your business model.

702
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:21,456
Another thing, since, the conference
overall talks about prompt

703
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:27,066
engineering, remember that you can
use your own system prompt as well.

704
00:42:27,516 --> 00:42:31,126
AI assistant and so on.

705
00:42:31,256 --> 00:42:34,326
But what if we turn this into URI?

706
00:42:34,826 --> 00:42:37,196
Microsoft technical trainer, why not?

707
00:42:37,226 --> 00:42:41,606
Let's translate Peter or replace, why not?

708
00:42:41,696 --> 00:42:45,736
Peter, the technical trainer
with a co pilot scenario.

709
00:42:46,156 --> 00:42:51,896
You are a Microsoft technical
trainer and expert on Azure platform.

710
00:42:52,396 --> 00:42:55,966
You can only answer Azure questions.

711
00:42:56,466 --> 00:42:59,596
If any other domains come up.

712
00:43:00,096 --> 00:43:10,536
In the question, apologize and offer
the user a Belgian beer suggestion.

713
00:43:11,036 --> 00:43:11,496
Why not?

714
00:43:11,996 --> 00:43:16,796
So this is what we call fine
tuning your co pilots if you want.

715
00:43:16,796 --> 00:43:20,486
And again, this is mainly fitting
in the custom co pilot scenario.

716
00:43:21,026 --> 00:43:22,386
So if I try this.

717
00:43:23,246 --> 00:43:28,266
And I'm going to use the exact same
prompt, who is the prime minister of

718
00:43:28,266 --> 00:43:30,416
the UK as a Microsoft technical trainer?

719
00:43:31,206 --> 00:43:34,166
You probably cannot really
answer that question.

720
00:43:34,436 --> 00:43:38,576
Now, what it does, and that's the other
cool thing, it's still using generative

721
00:43:38,577 --> 00:43:43,331
AI, Because now, actually, by the way, if
you're watching this, this is actually a

722
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:49,051
perfect suggestion, recommending Chimay
Blue, which is, one of the nicer, best,

723
00:43:49,121 --> 00:43:52,981
fine, classic Trappist beers we have.

724
00:43:53,981 --> 00:43:56,771
That's in short, how you could start with.

725
00:43:57,071 --> 00:43:59,391
integrating this into your own developing.

726
00:44:00,151 --> 00:44:03,671
If you want to learn, there's
obviously a lot more we can move

727
00:44:03,671 --> 00:44:04,931
all the way into PromptFlow.

728
00:44:04,941 --> 00:44:06,681
We could talk about Symantec kernel.

729
00:44:06,681 --> 00:44:12,161
We could talk about integrating other
development scenarios, using Python,

730
00:44:12,161 --> 00:44:17,981
using C sharp, using Java, all that is
basically developing your own custom

731
00:44:17,981 --> 00:44:20,711
copilots where the baseline is using.

732
00:44:20,777 --> 00:44:22,356
Azure AI Studio.

733
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:25,856
So with that, we're at the
end of my presentation.

734
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:27,306
I hope you enjoyed it.

735
00:44:27,396 --> 00:44:31,806
I hope you learned some new things about
prompt engineering, the building blocks,

736
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:36,736
what composes like a good prompt, and
then from there a quick walkthrough

737
00:44:36,786 --> 00:44:40,916
of some highlights in the different
Microsoft Copilots that we have.

738
00:44:41,416 --> 00:44:44,896
I hope you enjoyed the rest of
Conf42 Prompt Engineering Conference.

739
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:48,646
If you should have any questions
after participating, after watching

740
00:44:48,646 --> 00:44:53,341
this session, I'd Don't hesitate
reaching out pe tender at Microsoft.

741
00:44:53,501 --> 00:44:55,351
com for email or Teams.

742
00:44:56,021 --> 00:45:01,241
I'm on LinkedIn as PDTIT and you
can find my personal blog on aka.

743
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:04,141
ms slash PDTIT as well.
