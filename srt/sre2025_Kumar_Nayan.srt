1
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,810
Good morning, good afternoon,
good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:14,390
My name is Kumar and I'm honored to be
here at conference 42 to discuss what

3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,410
I believe is one of the most impactful
safety in modern manufacturing.

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,170
Applying site reliability engineering
or SRE principles to achieve strategic

5
00:00:24,259 --> 00:00:25,820
and long-lasting reliability.

6
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:30,110
Over the next half an hour or so,
we will explore how embracing a

7
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:36,019
proactive data-driven SRE mindset can
transform production flows, reduce

8
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:41,420
costly downtime, and pave the way for
a more efficient and resilient future.

9
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,100
Before we dive into the details,
let's take a quick look at

10
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,780
our roadmap for today's talk.

11
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:52,385
We gonna start by understanding the
reliability crisis in manufacturing

12
00:00:52,775 --> 00:00:54,815
and why traditional methods fall short.

13
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:59,675
Next, we'll examine how SRE
concepts can bridge up personal

14
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:04,055
technology and information
technology into a unified approach.

15
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,800
Next, we'll explore the case studies
and patterns that illustrate the real

16
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,830
world impact of SRE in manufacturing.

17
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,530
Next, we'll learn about practical
challenges, solutions, and a step by

18
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,930
step roadmap for SRE implementation.

19
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,400
This will follow by highlighting
the quantifiable business outcomes

20
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,730
organizations are seeing from
adopting these approaches.

21
00:01:29,744 --> 00:01:35,235
We'll end by outlining the next steps so
that you can begin your own SRE journey.

22
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:41,115
By the end of this session, I hope you
will feel empowered to look at your

23
00:01:41,115 --> 00:01:46,785
own existing processes with a fresh
perspective and to champion strategic

24
00:01:46,785 --> 00:01:49,214
reliability initiatives within your teams.

25
00:01:49,905 --> 00:01:53,264
Let's begin by clarifying
the why behind this approach.

26
00:01:54,035 --> 00:01:57,664
When we talk about reliability in
manufacturing, we are no longer

27
00:01:57,695 --> 00:02:03,695
speaking about it as a reactive
or post-incident measure in state.

28
00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:08,854
We now have the tools and methodology to
engineer reliability from the ground up.

29
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:15,335
So let's start by examining the state
of manufacturing reliability today

30
00:02:15,425 --> 00:02:20,495
and why so many organization feel
they are constantly putting out fires.

31
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,225
Let's try to understand what is
manufacturing reliability crisis.

32
00:02:26,465 --> 00:02:30,035
When we discuss a reliability
crisis, we are referring to how

33
00:02:30,035 --> 00:02:34,025
unplanned downtime and maintenance
emergencies have become the norm

34
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:36,125
in many manufacturing environments.

35
00:02:36,845 --> 00:02:42,905
Research so that on average a single hour
of unplanned downtime can cost upward

36
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:46,355
of $260,000 across various industries.

37
00:02:46,955 --> 00:02:52,265
That is an astonishing field, and it
does not even account for the ripple

38
00:02:52,265 --> 00:02:57,545
effect, such as backlog, delete
deliveries, and lost customer trust.

39
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:02,910
As you can see on the slide, there are
three main component of this crisis.

40
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:03,990
Number one.

41
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,510
Costly downtime.

42
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:11,150
The immediate loss in productivity and
the scramble to address breakdowns,

43
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,850
leads to a cascade of expenses.

44
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,230
Even a sort equipment failure
may push back productions

45
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,390
schedule for days or weeks.

46
00:03:21,525 --> 00:03:23,205
Next is reactive approaches.

47
00:03:23,685 --> 00:03:27,075
Many facilities rely heavily
on break fix methods.

48
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:31,095
They wait for things to fail
before mobilizing teams to

49
00:03:31,095 --> 00:03:33,105
repair or replace components.

50
00:03:33,705 --> 00:03:37,545
This firefighting posture
runs resources and generates a

51
00:03:37,545 --> 00:03:39,345
cycle of un unpredictability.

52
00:03:40,215 --> 00:03:45,045
And the last but not the list is siloed
information, which means in most plants.

53
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,620
Critical operational data is
scattered across different

54
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,500
systems, some legacy, some other.

55
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:58,160
Without a unified view, it is
incredibly challenging to spot

56
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,780
clear warnings or early warning
signs or identify root causes.

57
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,160
Companies end up spending
significant manpower and

58
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,410
budget on managing breakdowns.

59
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,450
Maintenance teams are a stretched
thin, and morale can suffer when they.

60
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,100
And when every day feels
like another day crisis.

61
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:25,490
Traditional metrics around uptime or
availability may look good on paper,

62
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:31,010
but in reality, they don't reflect the
continuous disruptions and the subtle

63
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:32,945
inefficiencies that add up over time.

64
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,560
Clearly, something needs to change.

65
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,330
We want to build a more resilient
vessel instead of trying to

66
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:43,130
patch leaks in a sinking set.

67
00:04:43,955 --> 00:04:46,895
That's where site reliability
engineering concepts coming.

68
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:52,265
Let's see how the safe, how this
safe transforms firefighting

69
00:04:52,265 --> 00:04:54,245
into a proactive prevention.

70
00:04:55,715 --> 00:04:56,855
Now let's talk.

71
00:04:57,185 --> 00:05:02,135
Let's spend some time talking
about SRE Paradigm Safety Site

72
00:05:02,165 --> 00:05:07,715
Reliability Engineering originated
in manufacturing site reliability.

73
00:05:07,715 --> 00:05:12,455
Engineering originated in the software
and tech world at companies like Google.

74
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,490
Where high availability and
efficiency are paramount.

75
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,760
The idea is to treat operations not
as a afterthought, but as a strategic

76
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:29,150
function that is engineered, measured,
and treated upon for constant improvement.

77
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,630
As you can see on the slide,
there are two sections.

78
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:38,120
One is for the traditional manufacturing
approach, and on the right side we

79
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,070
have SRE manufacturing approach.

80
00:05:41,345 --> 00:05:45,905
So let's focus on the right side,
which is on this SRE approach.

81
00:05:46,415 --> 00:05:51,365
But the key components are proactive
operational resilience, which means

82
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:57,305
instead of waiting for machines or,
or process to fail, SRE encourages

83
00:05:57,545 --> 00:06:00,185
building systems that anticipate issues.

84
00:06:00,815 --> 00:06:04,685
It's about identifying single
point of failure and mitigating

85
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:06,965
them before they cause downtime.

86
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,840
Next three component of it is
cross-functional collaboration.

87
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,330
SID principles break down silos by
bringing our presence, engineering

88
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,980
and quality teams together.

89
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:24,290
In software, we call it as DevOps
or Xerox, something like that.

90
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,150
And in manufacturing it
means bridging OT and it.

91
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:34,984
So that data, insights and
responsibilities are shared seamlessly.

92
00:06:36,155 --> 00:06:41,585
Next key component is automated
observability, which means whether it

93
00:06:41,585 --> 00:06:46,205
is a cloud-based analytics platform, or
s computing for real-time monitoring.

94
00:06:46,835 --> 00:06:51,575
SRE relies heavily on automation to
provide continuous visibility into

95
00:06:51,724 --> 00:06:53,075
every part of the production line.

96
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,360
Next main component is end-to-end
ecosystem coverage, which means

97
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:03,265
manufacturing reliability isn't
just about a single machine.

98
00:07:04,354 --> 00:07:10,385
But entire production ecosystem that is
from robotics on the soft floor to ERP

99
00:07:10,385 --> 00:07:14,885
system in the cloud, which is stores
transactions first, but not the list is

100
00:07:14,885 --> 00:07:20,525
measurable reliability, which means SRE
uses service level objectives that we

101
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:27,815
call as SLOs and service level indicators,
which cause SLIs to quantify reliability.

102
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:34,385
We set clear nuMe numeric targets such
as 99.9% availability of a particular

103
00:07:34,385 --> 00:07:40,145
assembly line or machine or production
system, or a certain threshold for

104
00:07:40,145 --> 00:07:45,185
qual quality yield and continuously
measure performance against those goals.

105
00:07:46,295 --> 00:07:50,885
Adopting these principles has consist
distinctly reduced unplanned downtime

106
00:07:50,885 --> 00:07:53,660
and improved mean time to recovery.

107
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,340
That is MTTR.

108
00:07:58,175 --> 00:08:00,095
Which is, which means
meantime to recovery.

109
00:08:01,055 --> 00:08:03,395
This shift is culture
as well as technical.

110
00:08:03,935 --> 00:08:09,155
It is about redefining reliability
as something we engineer and optimize

111
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:15,185
rather than something we hope to maintain
through good luck and peak repairs.

112
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:22,745
Next, let's expand this idea beyond a
single piece of equipment to encompass

113
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:25,115
an entire manufacturing environment.

114
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:32,030
Next, let's talk about holistic
manufacturing SRE model and what it

115
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,900
is to truly reap the benefits of SRE.

116
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:40,280
We need to look at the entire
manufacturing ecosystem holistically.

117
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:45,560
This includes, as you can see on
the slide, the four components.

118
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,320
Number one is shaft floor system.

119
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,280
This is about programmable
project controllers.

120
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,920
That is PLCs human machine interface.

121
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,490
That is hmis, robotics
and machine controllers.

122
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,580
Each of these has unique protocols
and timing to s. Next main component

123
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,590
is edge computing layers, which
is basically manufacturing excuse

124
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,580
system form that often run in real
time near the production line.

125
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:19,760
Next is core infrastructure, and
this includes on-prem services,

126
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:26,180
database and networks that handle
everything from patch scheduling

127
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,035
to Metro Resource Planning or MRP.

128
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,079
Last, but the Northeast is cloud services.

129
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,239
This consists of the area of remote
platforms that host data analytics,

130
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:44,930
digital twins, and enterprise application,
integrating multiple plans or geographies.

131
00:09:45,979 --> 00:09:49,250
An SRE approach demands
that each player's.

132
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,270
Each layer's reliability goals
are aligned and measured.

133
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:58,490
For instance, if your cloud-based digital
twins requires a real time data to

134
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:05,540
predict machinery failures that data feeds
need and agreed upon SLOs for uptime.

135
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,370
If the feed fails, your predictive
maintenance cannot function.

136
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,490
Potentially missing critical
early warning signs.

137
00:10:14,465 --> 00:10:20,765
This Holistical uh, this holistic model is
what makes SRE so powerful by engineering

138
00:10:20,765 --> 00:10:22,895
reliability across the entire stack.

139
00:10:23,435 --> 00:10:28,055
Branded sports are eliminated and
consistent data flow is insured.

140
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,710
It also means that reliability
is no longer an engineering

141
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,800
problem or an IT problem in state.

142
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:43,400
It is a shared objective that expands
entire facility or global operation.

143
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,340
Organizations that implement
a holistic SRE model usually

144
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,930
reports significant gains.

145
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,140
A few such gains can be listed as.

146
00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:00,680
Reduced unscheduled downtime, faster
incident protection and response.

147
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,479
More predictable products and
schedules and inventory management,

148
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,145
higher confidence from both internal
teams and external customers.

149
00:11:11,745 --> 00:11:16,564
Now, of course, to enable
this holistic coverage, we

150
00:11:16,564 --> 00:11:17,925
need comprehensive visibility.

151
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:22,125
Let's explore how advanced
monitoring and observability.

152
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:26,915
Pivotal in making reliability
miserable, and accident.

153
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:31,415
Now let's talk about advanced
monitoring and observability.

154
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:38,105
One of the main cornerstone of SRE is
having robust real-time insight into

155
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:42,095
everything that is happening across the
manufacturing or products and environment.

156
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:48,440
We call this observability because we
are interested in collecting data and

157
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,450
correlating it in meaningful ways.

158
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,900
As you can see on the slide, the.

159
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,729
Pyramid shape, which consists
of four components, predictive

160
00:11:58,729 --> 00:12:04,370
analytics, contextual correlation,
real-time visualization, and

161
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,839
comprehensive data collection.

162
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,550
Let's just start from the top.

163
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:13,520
That is predictive analytics by gathering
time series data, for example, related

164
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,810
to where vibration, temperature,
throughput rates, cycle times.

165
00:12:18,785 --> 00:12:23,344
We can use machine learning models
or rule-based algorithm to identify

166
00:12:23,824 --> 00:12:26,015
is before they cause failures.

167
00:12:27,005 --> 00:12:31,295
A study show that SRA driven
monitoring can reduce unplanned

168
00:12:31,295 --> 00:12:35,314
downtime by as much as 40 to 42%.

169
00:12:37,084 --> 00:12:39,844
Second layer from the top
is contextual correlation.

170
00:12:40,145 --> 00:12:46,310
What it means is if a certain robotic arm
in one area of the line is slowing down.

171
00:12:47,795 --> 00:12:52,355
Then SRE systems can correlate that
event with upstream or downstream

172
00:12:52,385 --> 00:12:58,655
signals like a sensor reading that
indicates a jam or particular patch

173
00:12:58,655 --> 00:13:00,755
of raw material that is out of spec.

174
00:13:02,285 --> 00:13:04,415
Next layer is realtime visualization.

175
00:13:04,745 --> 00:13:09,814
What it means is centralized dashboard
that give operators, engineers, and

176
00:13:09,814 --> 00:13:12,275
managers a life picture of system health.

177
00:13:13,265 --> 00:13:16,954
This includes metrics such as
overall equipment efficiency.

178
00:13:17,074 --> 00:13:21,665
That is OEE, machine
states and SLO compliance.

179
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:27,755
Last but not list at the bottom is
comprehensive data collection, which

180
00:13:27,755 --> 00:13:33,755
means telemetries gathered from PLCs,
edge devices, server logs, and cloud

181
00:13:33,755 --> 00:13:39,035
applications, and any other system
that may be integrated by pulling all

182
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:41,555
this data together helps transform it.

183
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:47,750
Transform a one siloed environment
into integrated transparent ecosystem.

184
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,750
These monitoring systems catch
problems early and empower teams

185
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,910
to do more strategic planning.

186
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,980
For example, if you see a machine
trending toward an out of tolerance

187
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:05,450
condition, you can schedule a
preventive maintenance window instead

188
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,670
of waiting for a catastrophic failure.

189
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,730
This proactively stands ultimately leads
to a calmer, more efficient operation.

190
00:14:15,325 --> 00:14:15,815
However,

191
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,570
advanced observability is only one facet.

192
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,180
The real gains come from.

193
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:29,630
When we layer specific SRE patterns on
top of this data to drive continuous

194
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:36,229
improvement, let's discuss some
more in emerging manufacturing SRE

195
00:14:36,229 --> 00:14:44,359
patterns that are proving especially
effective in bridging OT and it, let's

196
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:48,709
talk about emerging manufacturing
SRE patterns and what this mean.

197
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:54,200
In the journey to adopt on SRE
framework, organizations have developed

198
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,460
specialized patterns that address the
unique complexities of manufacturing.

199
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,470
As you can see on the slide, the
three such as specialized patterns

200
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,020
are industrial control systems.

201
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,610
That is ICS reliability.

202
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,330
You need this contents about.

203
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,590
Unique constraints, which is,
uh, ICS environment, often run

204
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,720
on older proprietary protocols.

205
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:23,750
They can't always be updated or
rebooted as easily as modern IT systems.

206
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,560
Now, this is addressed in SR Aion.

207
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:33,185
It is addressed by introducing
redundancy and a specialized monitoring

208
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:35,195
tailored to assist protocols.

209
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:41,045
Companies have seen up to a 45%
reduction in downtime caused

210
00:15:41,045 --> 00:15:42,665
by control system failures.

211
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:47,045
Next is OTIT integration framework.

212
00:15:49,985 --> 00:15:52,415
Basically, it is talking
about bridging the two worlds.

213
00:15:53,689 --> 00:16:01,280
Historically, OT and IT teams have been
separate in operating in silo and each

214
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,069
with its own security and data practices.

215
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:07,609
In SRE adaptation.

216
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:16,010
These are unified observability across
both domains, helps teams spot issues that

217
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,610
software, software and hardware layers.

218
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:25,400
It also strengthens security by
creating shared accountability and

219
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,620
more transparent data governance.

220
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:33,860
Last but not the list here is
digital twin deployment model, right?

221
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,095
This allows virtual testing ground.

222
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:43,520
By applying models in the production
environment virtually and experimenting

223
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,719
with the changes before rolling
them out on the factory floor.

224
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:52,819
So the, sorry, adaptability helps
in this is by predictive reliability

225
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:58,010
engineering, which is by stimulating
failures or throughput extremes.

226
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:02,959
Incident response teams are
trained in advance and optimize

227
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,060
processes within minimal risk.

228
00:17:06,545 --> 00:17:11,645
These patterns demonstrate how SRE is
not just a one size fits all approach.

229
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:16,954
Each manufacturing environment
can adapt patterns that best

230
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:21,365
align with this machinery data
infrastructure, and corporate culture.

231
00:17:22,535 --> 00:17:26,345
Let us see how one automated
manufacturer implemented these

232
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:29,135
principles and achieved tangible.

233
00:17:30,095 --> 00:17:32,615
Next, we'll talk about a case study.

234
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:39,950
Of an automotive manufacturer,
which implemented SRE principles to

235
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:43,790
illustrate the power of these ideas,
let's look at prominent automotive

236
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:49,010
manufacturer that implemented SRE
strategy across pre-assembly plants.

237
00:17:49,665 --> 00:17:51,890
What were the challenges?

238
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:56,480
They were dealing with frequent unplanned
downtime events, particularly at a

239
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,610
critical points along the assembly line.

240
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,310
This led to products and bottlenecks.

241
00:18:01,699 --> 00:18:05,179
MR. Delivery targets and
substantial financial losses.

242
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,490
They decided to implement SR
implementation, so the organization

243
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:15,500
developed clear service level
objectives, SLOs for the robotic

244
00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:22,159
welding station, paint shops, and
final assembly steps, because these

245
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:26,840
were the three critical areas where
the problem was repeatedly happening.

246
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,060
They also.

247
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,430
Introduce advanced observability
dashboards that consolidated data from

248
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:39,530
sensors, controllers, and enterprise
systems into a single interface.

249
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,960
What was the result?

250
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,850
Within 90 12 months?

251
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:49,190
The meantime to recovery,
that is MTTR dropped by 62%.

252
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:55,190
Unplanned downtime was
reduced by 45 to 47%.

253
00:18:56,465 --> 00:19:00,995
The company estimated almost
$3.2 million in savings annually

254
00:19:01,445 --> 00:19:03,635
from avoiding production losses.

255
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:08,615
And these all three results
were considerable and of utmost

256
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:09,754
importance for the company.

257
00:19:10,895 --> 00:19:14,135
Beyond the raw numbers, the
most significant outcome

258
00:19:14,135 --> 00:19:15,485
was the cultural shift.

259
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:20,720
Maintenance and engineering teams became
more proactive and management became

260
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:27,410
to see or began to see reliability
metrics as a strategic asset instead

261
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:33,710
of solely measuring efficiency in terms
of daily output, they started tracking

262
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:39,560
how reliability that output was or
how reliably that output was achieved.

263
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,630
This example shows that
SRE is not just a theory.

264
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:51,170
It delivers quantifiable benefits,
especially when there is strong executive

265
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,510
sponsorship and cross-functional buy-in.

266
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,200
Of course, it is not
always smooth sailing.

267
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,970
Let's take a look at some of the
challenges that might face when

268
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:06,380
implementing SRE and how to address them.

269
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,890
In this section, we'll, uh, look into
some implementation challenges for the.

270
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,260
While the potential benefits
are substantial, organizations

271
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,280
are often encounter barriers
during the SRE adoption process.

272
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:29,150
And the three common challenges that
organization face include legacy system

273
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:36,440
integration, next, reliability, metric
definition, and cultural alignment.

274
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,260
Starting at the top.

275
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,050
That is reliable legacy
system integration.

276
00:20:43,745 --> 00:20:44,495
Is the reality.

277
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:49,145
Reality is manufacturers operate
machines and control systems that are

278
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:52,235
20, 30, or 40 or even 50 years old.

279
00:20:53,165 --> 00:20:56,675
These legacy devices may not
have a straightforward data

280
00:20:56,675 --> 00:20:58,895
export or telemetry capabilities.

281
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:01,264
What is solution for this?

282
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:05,615
So solution is basically a
specialized industrial gateways

283
00:21:05,615 --> 00:21:07,085
and protocol converters.

284
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,615
Can extract relevant performance metrics.

285
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:18,425
SRE teams often partner with control
engineers to retrofit older equipment

286
00:21:18,425 --> 00:21:23,495
with the modern sensors, building a
bridge between dec old controllers

287
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,985
and a state of the art analytics.

288
00:21:27,005 --> 00:21:27,695
Next is reliability.

289
00:21:28,325 --> 00:21:29,285
Better definition.

290
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:31,200
What is the reality around this?

291
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:38,180
Determining what to measure and it
is always difficult to determine

292
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:43,970
what we want to measure and setting
realistic and challenging goals or SLOs.

293
00:21:43,995 --> 00:21:51,080
In our in SRE perspective, which requires
deep domain knowledge, a mismatch in this

294
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:56,720
leads to a metrics that don't reflect
true production goals and the solution for

295
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,780
this successful SR initiative typically.

296
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:05,315
From cross-functional committees
that include operations, engineering,

297
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:07,805
maintenance, and quality assurance teams.

298
00:22:08,705 --> 00:22:15,785
They work collaboratively to define
SLOs and SLIs, ensuring they align

299
00:22:15,785 --> 00:22:19,925
with both products and targets
and real time operational risk.

300
00:22:21,695 --> 00:22:26,225
Last but not the least, and most
important is cultural alignment.

301
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:33,710
The reality is it's difficult
shifting from a reactive fix it

302
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:39,620
when it is broken culture to a
proactive preventive before it breaks.

303
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:43,880
Breaks culture or mindset,
which is spark resistance.

304
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,995
Long tenured staff might be
surgical of new methodologies.

305
00:22:51,815 --> 00:22:53,240
What is the solution for this?

306
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,370
The solution is change management.

307
00:22:56,615 --> 00:22:57,785
Change management is crucial.

308
00:22:58,865 --> 00:23:03,125
Providing training pilot runs
that demonstrate clear winds and

309
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:09,065
communication, or communicating
the values of SRE in language that

310
00:23:09,065 --> 00:23:10,774
resonates with the shop floor.

311
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:15,425
Successive stories like the automatic
manufacturer we talked about

312
00:23:15,605 --> 00:23:17,885
earlier are powerful motivators.

313
00:23:18,935 --> 00:23:24,004
Overcoming these challenges requires
persistence, strategic planning.

314
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:26,720
Leadership support.

315
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,490
Most companies that tackle
these systematically begin to

316
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:36,290
see measurable improvements in
reliability within six to 12 months.

317
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,780
The question then is how best
to structure an SRE rollout?

318
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,640
Let's explore a strategy roadmap
that can guide implementing

319
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,950
organization a step by step.

320
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,560
In this section, we'll talk
about SRE implementation roadmap.

321
00:23:55,865 --> 00:23:59,525
A common thread among successful
manufacturing SRE rollouts

322
00:23:59,585 --> 00:24:03,485
are a structured approach
that grows progressively.

323
00:24:04,835 --> 00:24:09,605
On this slide, we'll talk about four
different phase roadmap that can

324
00:24:09,605 --> 00:24:11,465
be tailored while implementing sre.

325
00:24:12,935 --> 00:24:19,775
The phases include assessment,
pilot, a scale, and optimizing.

326
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:26,510
Let's just start with with from
the top that it assess during the

327
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:32,540
assessment organization need to
conduct a complete system inventory,

328
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:38,180
identify key reliability, pain
points, and measure baseline metrics.

329
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:43,525
This sets a clear before picture
to quantify improvements.

330
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:51,200
Outcome of this, uh, phase or step is
prioritize a list of system and processes

331
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,600
or gently needing SRE attention.

332
00:24:54,890 --> 00:25:01,880
Next phase is the pilot and action item
for this phase is basically select one or

333
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,250
two critical system that suffer frequent
downtime or are crucial to throughput.

334
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:17,300
Define a specific SLOs, say a 99%
or 99.9% uptime goal, and implement

335
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,530
initial monitoring, alerting,
and incident response protocols.

336
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:29,330
Outcome of this pilot phase is expected
to be quick wins that demonstrate value.

337
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:36,890
This stage fosters organizational buy-in
and provides a model for broader adoption.

338
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:40,790
Next phase in the process
is a scale, right?

339
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:47,270
The actions action item for this phase
is basically expanding SRE practices to

340
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:51,320
additional rocks and lines or processes.

341
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,890
Integrating automation tools
and refining workflows.

342
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:00,495
Cross-functional teams become
the norm, bridging it and ot.

343
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:05,389
Outcome of this phase is basically
a larger slice of operation

344
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:11,210
gains, continuous observability,
consistent SLO reporting, and more

345
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,159
proactive maintenance strategies.

346
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:21,020
The final phase of this implementation
is basically optimized, right?

347
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,970
That's an item of this phase is
basically leveraging advanced analytics,

348
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,580
machine learning and digital twins for.

349
00:26:29,195 --> 00:26:33,845
For predictive insights, trust
and operational staff to SRE

350
00:26:33,845 --> 00:26:39,665
knowledge be becomes, uh, embedded
a across the organization.

351
00:26:41,165 --> 00:26:45,185
Outcome of this phase is basically
a mature SRE culture with

352
00:26:45,185 --> 00:26:47,645
continuous improvement cycles.

353
00:26:48,545 --> 00:26:52,685
Incident response gets faster
and reliability moves closer

354
00:26:52,685 --> 00:26:56,890
to engineered perfection across
the manufacturing footprint.

355
00:26:58,774 --> 00:27:04,595
Following this roadmap ensures a
methodical rollout and helps sustain

356
00:27:04,595 --> 00:27:06,965
momentum needed for cultural change.

357
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:13,504
And of course, such systematic efforts
lead to tangible business results.

358
00:27:14,615 --> 00:27:20,135
Let us discuss some of the quantifiable
metrics companies are seeing when they

359
00:27:20,135 --> 00:27:23,075
fully embrace SRE in manufacturing.

360
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,620
Next we will talk about
quantifiable business impact.

361
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,250
By this point you may be wondering.

362
00:27:34,699 --> 00:27:37,879
Next, let's talk about
quantifiable business impact.

363
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:43,220
By this point, you may be wondering
what kind of hard numbers you can expect

364
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,935
if you successfully implement SRE.

365
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:52,459
As you can see on the slide, based
on collected data and case studies,

366
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:53,959
there are three components of it.

367
00:27:55,189 --> 00:27:57,949
Number one is 68% incident reduction.

368
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:05,179
On average, companies observe a 68%
drop in production impacting incidents.

369
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:08,840
Once the SRE framework is
implemented and are in place.

370
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:19,370
Uh, observe 43% MTTR improvement
that is, uh, meantime to recover,

371
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:25,790
meantime to recovery, or how quickly
you can fix issues when they arise,

372
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:31,070
improve significantly due to better
observability and more robust process.

373
00:28:31,699 --> 00:28:35,030
And the results have shown
the improvement is almost 43%.

374
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,510
The next is about annual savings.

375
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,070
That's a big one, right?

376
00:28:40,129 --> 00:28:44,210
Always everyone asks our question
is how much annual saving is going

377
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:49,460
to be so organized and frequently
report multimillion dollar savings

378
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,020
from preventing downtime alone?

379
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:56,930
This doesn't include secondary benefits,
like improved brand reputation or

380
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:03,950
reduced inventory carrying cost on an
average company, save almost $4.2 million

381
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,715
from from the past data that we have.

382
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:12,110
These gains go beyond plan
items on a spread set.

383
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:16,430
Reliable production schedule
allow for leaner inventories,

384
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:21,080
more accurate demand forecasting,
and higher employee satisfaction.

385
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:26,720
Once consumed by emergency repairs,
maintenance team can pivot to higher

386
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,270
level tasks such as process optimization.

387
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,870
Customers also notice the improvement.

388
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:37,835
You build trust and strengthen
your competitive advantage.

389
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,415
When you consistently deliver on time.

390
00:29:41,465 --> 00:29:46,175
As r related reliability becomes
a true differentiator In markets

391
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:51,515
where zero time, time, downtime is,
uh, increasingly an expectation.

392
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,680
Now that we have covered the business
case, let's talk about the next

393
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:03,590
practical steps you can take to
begin or accelerate your SRE journey.

394
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:10,550
Next, let's talk about the next steps,
what your SRE journey looks like, right?

395
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:14,450
If all this resonates with you,
you might wonder where do we start?

396
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,240
Here are four immediate steps to help
you kick off your transformation.

397
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,150
Number one assessment workshop.

398
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:29,600
Before diving into technical deployments,
you need to gather stakeholders,

399
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:36,110
production managers, it, ot, and
maintenance leads to identify core

400
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:40,430
bottlenecks and reliability gaps,
and what is the benefit of it?

401
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,600
You will have a concrete
cross-disciplinary understanding

402
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:50,240
of your current state and where SRE
principles could deliver the most impact.

403
00:30:51,245 --> 00:30:56,885
Next on the list is pilot program design
and question will be why it is needed.

404
00:30:58,715 --> 00:31:02,825
We need to pick up some critical
high visibility area to demonstrate

405
00:31:02,825 --> 00:31:07,055
success rather than overall every
overhaul, everything at once.

406
00:31:08,285 --> 00:31:09,635
And what did the benefit of it?

407
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:12,755
It gives quick wins, which build momentum.

408
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:19,145
Justify further investment and give teams
hands-on experience with SRE practices.

409
00:31:20,285 --> 00:31:22,385
Next step is team enablement.

410
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:28,895
SRE is a collaborative, discipline,
operational, or operation for personal

411
00:31:28,895 --> 00:31:33,995
need, to need the skills and mindset to
leverage new tools and data effectively.

412
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:39,155
The benefit of it is basically
continuous learning and professional

413
00:31:39,155 --> 00:31:44,344
development, which help with the
immediate pilot and ensure that

414
00:31:44,344 --> 00:31:46,625
future expansions will be smooth.

415
00:31:50,435 --> 00:31:53,074
Last, but not the list is
implementers and roadmap.

416
00:31:54,334 --> 00:31:55,739
This requires real change.

417
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:57,950
Plan.

418
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:03,650
Right, so basically about
defining the milestones, budgets,

419
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:07,400
roles, and performance metrics
that is going to be measured.

420
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,440
And the benchmark.

421
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:14,510
The benefit of it is basically
visibility and accountability.

422
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:22,730
Everyone knows where the effort is headed
and how success will be measured overall.

423
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:27,590
Remember that SRE in manufacturing
is a marathon, not a sprint.

424
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:34,490
All the challenges are natural, but each
incremental improvement in reliability

425
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,610
pays off exponentially over the long term.

426
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,850
Wrap up our session by summarizing
the key takeaways and looking at the

427
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:46,430
future for manufacturing reliability.

428
00:32:48,365 --> 00:32:53,945
This brings us to the conclusion of this
talk, and as we conclude our 30 minute

429
00:32:53,945 --> 00:32:56,195
journey into SRE for manufacturing.

430
00:32:56,315 --> 00:33:01,295
Let's recap the main points We talked
about manufacturing, reliability

431
00:33:01,295 --> 00:33:06,785
crisis, which is basically highlighting
about unplanned downtime costs,

432
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:11,195
arguments, and traditional reactive
methods are no longer sufficient

433
00:33:11,885 --> 00:33:13,805
in today's competitive landscape.

434
00:33:15,065 --> 00:33:17,105
Next, we talked about paradigm shift.

435
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,400
Which is basically site reliability
engineering, introducing proactive

436
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:26,180
engineered reliability with
cross-functional collaboration

437
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,670
and metric-driven accountability.

438
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,880
We talked about holistic taking,
holistic approach, which is about

439
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:41,540
effective SRE spans software, uh,
software systems, s devices on-prem

440
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,060
infrastructure and cloud platforms.

441
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,070
Anything and everything that an
organization is impacted by and all

442
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,470
sharing data and insights in real time.

443
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:57,709
Next, we talked about advanced
observability, which is about monitoring

444
00:33:57,709 --> 00:34:03,080
and predictive monitoring and predictive
analytics, which enables team stress

445
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:08,989
part issues early, reduce incident
rates, and accelerate recovery times.

446
00:34:10,189 --> 00:34:13,219
Next, we talked about
emerging SRE patterns.

447
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:22,040
Which contains ICS reliability T and
IT integration and digital twin uses,

448
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,709
which are basically among the specialized
patterns driving significant gain.

449
00:34:28,189 --> 00:34:31,759
We also covered about, talked
about a case study of an automotive

450
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:36,439
manufacturer, which is basically a
real world example to show dramatic

451
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:42,290
reduction in downtime and meaningful ROI
sometimes in the millions of dollars.

452
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,840
We talked about overcoming challenges,
which is basically about legacy

453
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:53,630
integration, metric alignment,
and cultural barriers that can be

454
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:57,200
addressed through dedicated change
management and faced adoption.

455
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:04,040
We covered roadmap and business impact,
which included about, uh, a structured

456
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,980
rollout and precise measurement of SLOs.

457
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,930
Which deliver quantifiable
benefits, often 10 of percentage

458
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:16,070
points in downtime reduction and
millions of dollars in saving.

459
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,440
And finally, we talked about the next
steps, which included basically key

460
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,470
phases, four phases, which is assessment,
pilot programs, team training, and an

461
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:33,230
overarching implementation roadmap, which
are key to a sustainable transformation.

462
00:35:34,685 --> 00:35:40,685
Ultimately embracing SRN manufacturing
is just about keeping machines running.

463
00:35:41,524 --> 00:35:46,265
It is about fostering a culture of
continuous improvement where reliability

464
00:35:46,265 --> 00:35:49,415
is woven into every aspect of operation.

465
00:35:50,464 --> 00:35:55,145
This culture and technological
alignment can yield incredible

466
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,189
competitive, uh, advantages.

467
00:35:59,285 --> 00:36:03,965
By with greater output, consistency,
lower operational cost, and

468
00:36:03,965 --> 00:36:07,595
the workforce empowered rather
than broadened by technology.

469
00:36:09,485 --> 00:36:14,765
Finally, thank you for joining me in this,
uh, exploration of SRE based reliability.

470
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:21,905
I hope you live here today with few
insights and, uh, the inspiration to

471
00:36:21,905 --> 00:36:25,865
Champion Reliability as a strategic
driver in your organization.

472
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:33,080
Thank you again and I look forward to any
questions or suggestions you may have.

473
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:33,860
Thank you.
