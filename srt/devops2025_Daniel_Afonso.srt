00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,500
Hello, welcome 42 DevOps 2025.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,140
It's a real pleasure to be here.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,049
And I'm really excited to be
doing this talk that I'm going

4
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,080
to be doing to you today.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,149
I hope you're having an amazing event,
having a ton of fun and learning a lot.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,569
So shall we start?

7
00:00:15,069 --> 00:00:15,459
Okay.

8
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:20,159
So incidents happen when
you least expect one moment.

9
00:00:20,159 --> 00:00:22,120
You're happily delivering a new feature.

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,090
You've been working on the next one.

11
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,409
You get an alert that something is wrong
and apparently production's your fire.

12
00:00:29,909 --> 00:00:33,279
When this happens, the human instinct
is to worry, is to get stressed.

13
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:34,639
There's anxiety.

14
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,419
Well, to that, I'm here
to tell you, don't panic.

15
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:42,049
we're going to be talking a bit today
about effective incident response.

16
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:45,859
Just before we continue,
let me introduce myself.

17
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,089
My name is Daniela Fonse.

18
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:49,689
I'm a developer advocate at PagerDuty.

19
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:51,029
I'm an instructor at Aged.

20
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:51,739
io.

21
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:55,709
I'm the author of a book called State
Management with React Query, and

22
00:00:56,139 --> 00:01:00,079
you can find me pretty much anywhere
online at the handle danieljcofonts.

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,169
If you want to connect with me as well,
you can find me on the fonts at pagerduo.

24
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:09,099
com or connect to connect to our
in our community page at community.

25
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:09,909
pagerduo.

26
00:01:09,949 --> 00:01:10,189
com.

27
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:13,709
Let's talk about incident response.

28
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:16,579
So what is incident response?

29
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:18,039
Incident response is.

30
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,779
An organized approach to addressing
and managing an incident.

31
00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:25,809
You see companies handle
incidents differently every day.

32
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:26,109
And.

33
00:01:26,994 --> 00:01:30,344
Most of them can handle incidents
without having an organized

34
00:01:30,344 --> 00:01:31,774
incident response process, though.

35
00:01:32,274 --> 00:01:35,214
But, with an effective incident
response process, your goal

36
00:01:35,254 --> 00:01:36,964
isn't just to solve the incident.

37
00:01:37,044 --> 00:01:40,024
It's to handle it in an organized way.

38
00:01:40,294 --> 00:01:41,644
Therefore, the organized word.

39
00:01:42,374 --> 00:01:46,024
It's in an organized way that will allow
you to limit damage, and will allow

40
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:49,244
you to reduce recovery time and costs.

41
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:50,814
So, the keyword?

42
00:01:51,314 --> 00:01:54,944
After all, you can give a developer
a keyboard and some time, and

43
00:01:54,954 --> 00:01:56,094
they will solve the problem.

44
00:01:56,214 --> 00:01:59,954
Incident Response is about
solving a problem quickly, while

45
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:03,384
minimizing this damage and reducing
the associated costs to it.

46
00:02:03,884 --> 00:02:08,144
So, how can we get started
with Incident Response?

47
00:02:08,304 --> 00:02:10,609
There are three steps that we can follow.

48
00:02:11,149 --> 00:02:15,419
The first one is to use a
systematic learning and improvement.

49
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,819
This means that you can build off
the mistakes you make and avoid

50
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:21,089
repeating them in the future.

51
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:23,059
You keep learning, you keep improving.

52
00:02:23,929 --> 00:02:28,689
The second one is to mobilize and inform
only the right people at the right time.

53
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:33,129
This will make the resolution effort more
efficient, will drive down the overall

54
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:37,499
time to resolve incidents, and will reduce
the strain and overwork on your staff.

55
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:38,959
And then the third.

56
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:42,199
It's how to mate everything you can.

57
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:46,249
You should make technology work for
you, and you should make it work for

58
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,609
you by setting up rules and actions
that will trigger automatically when

59
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:51,269
there's time and when you need them.

60
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:56,319
The bottom line is, we want
to replace chaos with calm.

61
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,949
Like I said previously, it's
very easy to go into panic mode.

62
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:02,359
It's very easy to stress and get nervous.

63
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:05,029
But this is not good during an incident.

64
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:07,939
It will only add to the problem
and will cause more confusion.

65
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:10,469
We want stuff to be calm and organized.

66
00:03:11,309 --> 00:03:14,759
Our incident response process
is heavily based on the Incident

67
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:16,839
Command System, or ICS for short.

68
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:22,449
So for those of you who are not familiar,
ICS was Developed after some devastating

69
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:27,139
wildfires that happened in Southern
California in the 1970s When this happened

70
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,649
thousands of firefighters responded,
but an issue happened Well, they found

71
00:03:32,649 --> 00:03:37,369
out that it was tricky to work together
because they were very good individually.

72
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,024
They knew how to fight these fires
by themselves, but they lack the

73
00:03:41,024 --> 00:03:44,264
common framework on how to do
it together as a larger group.

74
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:49,164
So this framework they developed is used
by everyone from local fire department

75
00:03:49,174 --> 00:03:51,264
responding to a house fire to the U.

76
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:51,414
S.

77
00:03:51,444 --> 00:03:54,394
government responding to a
natural disaster and several other

78
00:03:54,394 --> 00:03:55,634
organizations around the world.

79
00:03:56,344 --> 00:04:01,094
It provides a standard enough response
that everyone is familiar with and

80
00:04:01,094 --> 00:04:05,764
it will help prevent confusion and
cause during an incident, especially

81
00:04:05,774 --> 00:04:07,284
when working cross functionally.

82
00:04:07,344 --> 00:04:08,334
It sounds pretty good, right?

83
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:13,454
Now, the first step to having an
organized incident response process

84
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,654
is to define some key terms.

85
00:04:15,884 --> 00:04:18,234
And the first one is, what's an incident?

86
00:04:18,734 --> 00:04:24,014
It might sound too obvious, but if you
ask around, different companies are

87
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,815
going to have different definitions.

88
00:04:26,174 --> 00:04:31,470
At PagerDuty, we define an incident as
any unplanned disruption or degradation

89
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,000
of service that is actively affecting
customers ability to use the product.

90
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,930
Some companies also include some
internal facing disruptions like

91
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:43,270
having a security breach or not
being able to run maltent accounting.

92
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,889
If any business metrics have
deviated from normal behavior,

93
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:49,539
this can be considered an incident.

94
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,660
Whether you're experiencing a substantial
number of failed transactions on your

95
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,139
shopping cart or a large increase in
processing time for lineups in your store.

96
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:02,799
These could be considered incidents as
your service is being negatively impacted.

97
00:05:03,299 --> 00:05:05,799
What should be important
here is that you should use a

98
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:07,189
definition that works for you.

99
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,989
As long as you have a standardized
definition that is wildly known throughout

100
00:05:10,989 --> 00:05:13,709
your organization and you keep it simple.

101
00:05:14,524 --> 00:05:15,124
it should work.

102
00:05:15,424 --> 00:05:18,834
The last thing you want is
ambiguity when there's an outage

103
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:19,984
and people are stressing out.

104
00:05:20,484 --> 00:05:26,914
Now, after an incident, the next level
is to define what a major incident is.

105
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:32,074
A major incident is harder to
define because it will, once

106
00:05:32,074 --> 00:05:34,725
again, vary between organizations.

107
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:38,085
We have found that major incidents
have a few things in common.

108
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:42,484
So, the first thing is, they often
happen with little or no warning.

109
00:05:42,484 --> 00:05:42,644
Okay.

110
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:44,964
Then, you must respond quickly.

111
00:05:45,954 --> 00:05:50,034
Having these services degradated or
down will cost your company a ton

112
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:51,614
of money and valuable resources.

113
00:05:52,114 --> 00:05:55,864
The third thing is, you will rarely
understand what's happening at

114
00:05:55,864 --> 00:05:57,004
the beginning of the incident.

115
00:05:57,184 --> 00:06:00,554
You're going to encounter
bumps and turns all over.

116
00:06:01,484 --> 00:06:05,134
And the fourth stuff is, you
must mobilize a team of the right

117
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:06,684
responders to resolve an issue.

118
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:10,534
And, they should coordinate cross
functionally to get a response.

119
00:06:11,034 --> 00:06:16,114
At PagerDuty, our definition of
a major incident is any incident

120
00:06:16,164 --> 00:06:19,334
that requires a coordinated
response between multiple teams.

121
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:23,484
This definition should be short and
a simple statement that will make

122
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:26,434
sure that, once again, everyone
is on the same page and everyone

123
00:06:26,434 --> 00:06:27,714
understands what we're talking about.

124
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:32,944
In particular, you want to remove any
discussions or disagreements around

125
00:06:32,944 --> 00:06:38,284
if something is happening or if it's
actually a major incident or not.

126
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:42,789
This is not something that you
want to happen when The house is

127
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:44,429
on fire and everyone is discussing.

128
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:47,109
Hmm, is this actually a major incident?

129
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:50,529
So, make sure that your definition
is short and straight to the point.

130
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:54,439
Something that could be helpful as well
is, if you have a metric to use like,

131
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:58,610
when we experience more than 100 errors
per minute, it's a major incident.

132
00:06:59,049 --> 00:06:59,649
That's great.

133
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:04,579
You can also tie it to the customer
impact, like deciding we're experiencing

134
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:09,349
a major incident when more than 5
percent of our customers are affected.

135
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:14,559
So discuss with your company, get
it written and make sure everyone

136
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:17,619
understands it and is on the same page.

137
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:22,329
The reason this should be a first step
is You can't respond to an incident

138
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:24,209
until you know what an incident is.

139
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:27,289
If one person considers something
an incident, but the rest of the

140
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:31,229
organization doesn't, then it's
going to create a big ambiguity and

141
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:32,919
confusion during the incident response.

142
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:33,359
So.

143
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:37,959
Repeating, brainstorm and decide on a
clear definition and then standardize it

144
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,509
across your entire organization so that
everyone has the same understanding.

145
00:07:41,989 --> 00:07:44,389
Like I said, you want to
replace chaos with calm.

146
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:48,249
By having a definition for both
incidents and major incidents,

147
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:52,139
then you can add in the clarity for
your team to know what to do next.

148
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:56,004
So these definitions could be
Create a distinction between normal

149
00:07:56,054 --> 00:07:58,374
operations and emergency operations.

150
00:07:58,714 --> 00:08:02,124
Once you cross the line into emergency
operations, your decision making

151
00:08:02,124 --> 00:08:05,924
processes will change even dramatically.

152
00:08:05,924 --> 00:08:09,944
So there are stuff that you
would do on normal operations

153
00:08:09,974 --> 00:08:14,094
that wouldn't be acceptable, but
when you're in emergency mode.

154
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:17,574
You could do it like, for instance,
as deploying code without tests.

155
00:08:17,884 --> 00:08:22,874
This might be an acceptable during
normal operations, but perfectly

156
00:08:22,874 --> 00:08:26,234
acceptable when there's a major incident
and you need to recover quickly.

157
00:08:27,134 --> 00:08:31,154
The way you operate your role, the
hierarchy and the level of risk

158
00:08:31,154 --> 00:08:32,814
you're willing to take will change.

159
00:08:33,194 --> 00:08:35,944
Change as you move out of
normal operations and into

160
00:08:35,954 --> 00:08:37,064
incident response mode.

161
00:08:37,564 --> 00:08:41,854
This is why we recommend that you
use metrics tied for business impact.

162
00:08:42,364 --> 00:08:46,444
For example, a metric we monitor
at PagerDuty is number of

163
00:08:46,524 --> 00:08:48,774
outbound notifications per second.

164
00:08:49,464 --> 00:08:52,404
At Amazon, it could be
number of orders per second.

165
00:08:52,504 --> 00:08:55,824
At Netflix, it could be
stream starts per second.

166
00:08:55,934 --> 00:09:01,679
Monitoring It's important and monitoring
this important metrics will then help

167
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,469
you determine the severity of an incident
and the type of response you should use.

168
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:09,469
So if you use metrics that aren't
tied to any business impact, for

169
00:09:09,469 --> 00:09:14,649
instance, as the CPU usage is high on
the host, then it can be difficult.

170
00:09:14,984 --> 00:09:18,414
Or even sometimes impossible to
determine the severity of an incident

171
00:09:18,444 --> 00:09:20,134
that's associated with that metric.

172
00:09:20,634 --> 00:09:25,044
What you really want, it's a metric
that lets you know how your business

173
00:09:25,074 --> 00:09:29,514
is doing and how it's doing, not how a
particular piece of an equipment is doing.

174
00:09:30,124 --> 00:09:34,334
Remember, Making, a wrong decision is
better than making no decision at all.

175
00:09:34,714 --> 00:09:38,624
A wrong decision gives you more useful
information to work with while making

176
00:09:38,624 --> 00:09:40,654
no decision gives you nothing at all.

177
00:09:41,194 --> 00:09:44,804
think of it as trying to spread,
reduce the spread of a fire.

178
00:09:45,064 --> 00:09:48,994
If you just sit there and decide
to, okay, what are my options?

179
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:49,924
Let's think about them.

180
00:09:50,264 --> 00:09:52,174
Your house might burn without knowing it.

181
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:55,634
So in a sense, taking
no action, is an action.

182
00:09:56,284 --> 00:09:58,674
We can call this even decision paralysis.

183
00:09:59,084 --> 00:10:01,784
So remember this, please make a decision.

184
00:10:02,074 --> 00:10:04,634
You get learnings from it and
you know what to do afterwards.

185
00:10:05,134 --> 00:10:08,414
How do you move out of normal
operations into an emergency mode?

186
00:10:08,914 --> 00:10:10,974
Well, you trigger the incident response.

187
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:14,634
Obviously, you can do it on pager
duty or on the tool that you're using.

188
00:10:14,684 --> 00:10:18,174
We recommend, two ways of
triggering this process.

189
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:21,864
First, we, we encourage
automatic detention and

190
00:10:21,874 --> 00:10:22,904
triggering within the product.

191
00:10:23,404 --> 00:10:26,014
wherever it can be done
effectively and accurately.

192
00:10:26,274 --> 00:10:29,594
If an organization has working
integrations and reliable metrics that

193
00:10:29,784 --> 00:10:33,714
track business impact, such as loss
of sales per minute or success rates

194
00:10:33,714 --> 00:10:37,994
for API calls, we recommend you that
you leverage this knowledge and use it

195
00:10:38,064 --> 00:10:40,094
to automatically trigger an incident.

196
00:10:40,794 --> 00:10:43,924
This will reduce time wasted on
human based assessment and will

197
00:10:43,924 --> 00:10:45,744
drive down the time to resolution.

198
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:51,114
Second, we highly encourage humans
to manually trigger the incident too.

199
00:10:51,524 --> 00:10:53,374
This is very important at PagerDuty.

200
00:10:53,784 --> 00:10:57,344
By lowering the barrier to triggering
an incident response, leads to

201
00:10:57,344 --> 00:11:00,954
a dramatic increase in the speed
of which incidents are resolved.

202
00:11:01,804 --> 00:11:05,874
We don't want people to sit on a problem
because the alarm hasn't gone off yet.

203
00:11:05,894 --> 00:11:09,734
If customer support, for instance,
gets a lot of requests very quickly,

204
00:11:10,384 --> 00:11:13,104
well, this is probably a sign
that something is wrong, right?

205
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:17,114
So, how do we as humans
trigger the process?

206
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:21,569
Well, we do it with a chat command, but
don't feel like that's the only way.

207
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:23,569
I just wanted to demonstrate
it to give you an idea.

208
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:25,459
You can do it however you want.

209
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:30,349
Use the head on, having a flashing
light on the office, you can

210
00:11:30,349 --> 00:11:32,129
hire a mariachi band, whatever.

211
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:34,399
Do what you prefer.

212
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:38,809
The point is, you want having a way
to trigger this response that's fast,

213
00:11:38,969 --> 00:11:40,269
easy, and available to everyone.

214
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:44,899
Once you have triggered the incident,
now we have a stable, repeatable

215
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:46,989
pattern to follow when responding.

216
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:52,609
So, our steps to, our process when dealing
with an incident is the following one.

217
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:56,479
So, we follow the triage, mobilize,
resolve, and prevent process.

218
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:01,019
So, when you're notified that
an incident is happening, you

219
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,019
first must access and triage it.

220
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:06,639
Here, you will assess the severity
and the urgency of the incident.

221
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:11,849
Secondly, you need to mobilize, the right
people who can work together towards the

222
00:12:11,849 --> 00:12:14,569
resolution and that leads us to resolving.

223
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:18,219
Now we are all working together
towards a common goal, which

224
00:12:18,219 --> 00:12:19,619
is to resolve the incident.

225
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:24,839
The last step is to prevent the incident
from happening again into the future.

226
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:30,744
We don't want Having multiple incidents
on the case of the same issue.

227
00:12:30,744 --> 00:12:33,084
So we need to make sure
that we prevent it.

228
00:12:34,064 --> 00:12:38,524
Now, in order for these steps to happen,
we need to have the right team and

229
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:42,404
roles engage, and this is where we come
into the roles of incident response.

230
00:12:42,404 --> 00:12:44,364
And we're going to go
over each one of them.

231
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:45,204
So.

232
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:50,379
The top section that we have here,
it's the command section and this

233
00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:54,269
includes three critical roles,
starting with the most important

234
00:12:54,289 --> 00:12:55,959
one, which is the incident commander.

235
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:01,169
This is the highest ranked person
on the incident response system,

236
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,909
when an incident response happens.

237
00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:06,854
Yes, they're even more important
than the CEO of the company.

238
00:13:07,324 --> 00:13:10,124
They should be the single source
of truth during an incident,

239
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:11,804
and they are the ones in charge.

240
00:13:12,164 --> 00:13:16,304
They make all the decisions, and no
action should be performed unless the

241
00:13:16,304 --> 00:13:17,894
incident commander gives the go ahead.

242
00:13:18,574 --> 00:13:22,624
They will help drive major incidents to
resolution and coordinate the response.

243
00:13:23,124 --> 00:13:27,224
And the best part of this is that
they don't even need to have technical

244
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:31,094
knowledge, as long as they understand
your incident response process, and they

245
00:13:31,094 --> 00:13:35,304
know how the steps involved with being
an incident commander, they can do it.

246
00:13:35,364 --> 00:13:38,294
And this, that's what's
really exciting about this.

247
00:13:39,244 --> 00:13:42,984
Next, underneath the incident commander,
we have the scribe and the deputy.

248
00:13:43,104 --> 00:13:47,854
The scribe is responsible for documenting
the timeline of the incident as it

249
00:13:47,884 --> 00:13:52,214
progresses, and the scribe is also
responsible for making sure that, well,

250
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:56,774
all the important decisions and data
are captured and can be later reviewed.

251
00:13:57,434 --> 00:14:01,954
At PagerDuty, we use Slack to keep an
internal record of major incidents, and

252
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:08,139
the scribe will Post in the the specific
channel for the this incident to record

253
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:11,909
the life progress of the incident this
way we have a solid history of what was

254
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:17,969
discussed what were the decisions that
were made and Anyone I mean and I mean

255
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:21,719
anyone in the company can go ahead and
they can read it for status updates if

256
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:26,854
they'd like If you have to slide if you
have slack Or teams, at the end of the day

257
00:14:26,854 --> 00:14:28,494
it will depend on the tool you're using.

258
00:14:28,814 --> 00:14:31,484
I recommend you have an incident
response channel set up for your

259
00:14:31,484 --> 00:14:32,764
department or for your team.

260
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:36,164
You can keep it open and ongoing
each time that there's an incident,

261
00:14:36,184 --> 00:14:40,034
and this way when an incident occurs
you're not looking for, okay where's

262
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:42,064
that incident, specific channel.

263
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:45,374
Make sure it's there, make sure everyone
knows which one, which one it is.

264
00:14:45,874 --> 00:14:46,944
Then we have the deputy.

265
00:14:47,534 --> 00:14:51,084
So the deputy is a direct support
role for the incident commander.

266
00:14:51,514 --> 00:14:54,904
This is not a shadow, they're
not just there observing.

267
00:14:54,914 --> 00:14:58,804
The deputy is expected to perform some
important tasks during the incident.

268
00:14:58,934 --> 00:15:04,854
They make sure that the incident
commander is on focus and that they can

269
00:15:04,854 --> 00:15:06,004
be there supporting the investigation.

270
00:15:06,284 --> 00:15:09,534
When whatever they need or
whatever the task they do.

271
00:15:09,564 --> 00:15:14,084
So basically they're the right hand
person to the incident commander.

272
00:15:14,584 --> 00:15:20,894
Then on the liaison parts, we have the
internal liaison and the customer liaison.

273
00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:22,834
So they're responsible for communication.

274
00:15:23,349 --> 00:15:26,169
They're responsible for
communication with the company.

275
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:30,999
In the case of the external of the
internal liaison and with the customers

276
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:34,409
in part, in the case of the customer
liaison, PagerDuty provides a status

277
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:38,159
page two that keeps customers updated on
the impact of the incident in real time.

278
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:41,819
And these are the folks that are
responsible for coordinating this effort.

279
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:43,879
Now onto the operations section.

280
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:46,069
These are basically the
people that get Amazon.

281
00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:50,869
Subject matter expert or the resolver
when an incident happens, they will be the

282
00:15:50,869 --> 00:15:53,009
people, the ones who are alerted first.

283
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:56,839
this is because they are the ones who have
technical expertise and they are the ones

284
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:02,029
who can access the incident and determine
if they can resolve it on their own or

285
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:03,799
if the impact is too large for that.

286
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:06,459
If the business impact is too great.

287
00:16:06,609 --> 00:16:11,159
and there's a large of amounts of
subject matter experts needed, then

288
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:15,379
the primary on call responder will
page the on call incident commander and

289
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:17,189
begin the incident response process.

290
00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:22,819
This operation staff group of subject
matter experts may consist of one

291
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:26,189
or more people, depending on the
severity of the incident, the size of

292
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:27,839
your department, and number of teams.

293
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:32,899
Keep in mind, and this is important,
This chart might increase or decrease.

294
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:36,769
This is just an example of how
we do it here at PagerDuty.

295
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,349
We have seen ones who are too long
enough to write a book on and we

296
00:16:41,349 --> 00:16:44,519
have seen ones that reduce this
chart even more considerably.

297
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:49,959
So look at your organization, figure out
what makes sense and how you would adapt.

298
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,159
How do I prepare to manage
an incident response team?

299
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:56,689
Well, the next sections we're
going to go over a couple of

300
00:16:56,689 --> 00:16:58,769
steps, starting with the step one.

301
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:04,149
Ensure explicit process processes and
expectations exist and that people

302
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:08,649
are trained and this means, well,
create standardized definitions.

303
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,489
And I've talked about this before.

304
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:14,059
Make sure everyone knows what an
incident is and what a major incident is.

305
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:17,419
Define your incident response
process and communication channels

306
00:17:17,749 --> 00:17:21,029
and make sure everyone on the
organization is on the same page.

307
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:24,529
You need to make sure that everyone
is involved and understands how

308
00:17:24,969 --> 00:17:28,619
stuff works because without everyone
have being on the same page.

309
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:30,539
Stuff is not going to work out properly.

310
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,189
Then, practice running
major incidents as a team.

311
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:37,379
This will help, the team to practice.

312
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:41,559
And it will enable responders
to act more calm and collected.

313
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:46,109
This way, when the real stuff
happens, they'll be ready.

314
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:51,739
Think about this, so if a firefighter only
fought one or two small fires a year, and

315
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:57,464
then suddenly they're caught to a major
forest fire, They'll probably panic.

316
00:17:57,614 --> 00:18:00,484
They're less likely to act
calm, cool, and collected.

317
00:18:00,984 --> 00:18:02,704
So, how do you handle this?

318
00:18:03,674 --> 00:18:04,414
You practice.

319
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:08,624
A great way to practice is if you
have an incident that might be of

320
00:18:08,624 --> 00:18:13,744
an downrated severity, but you can
say, okay, now, this is not a very,

321
00:18:14,234 --> 00:18:17,564
this is a low severity incident, but
let's treat it as a major incident.

322
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:19,094
This way you will learn.

323
00:18:19,554 --> 00:18:22,364
how your response process worked, and
you'll be able to tune your systems

324
00:18:22,364 --> 00:18:25,574
to better know, to better understand
that you're not triggering a major

325
00:18:25,574 --> 00:18:26,934
incident when they're less severe.

326
00:18:27,434 --> 00:18:30,564
This is why at PagerDuty
we run Failure Fridays.

327
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:36,664
It keeps us on our toes, and it makes us
be ready when and at any moment noticed.

328
00:18:37,189 --> 00:18:40,659
The point of this exercise is to make
sure that the production operation systems

329
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:45,549
are doing what we need them to do and
when we need them to do, and that this

330
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:47,539
can be a number of different subsystems.

331
00:18:47,749 --> 00:18:51,029
So, for instance, are the metrics
and the observability tools

332
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:54,119
giving us the right telemetry in
the right way at the right time?

333
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:58,729
Are de escalation policies,
notifications, incident rooms

334
00:18:58,729 --> 00:19:00,309
working the way we expect them to?

335
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:05,029
Does everyone know what's expecting
of them and where they need to be?

336
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:09,689
And then, if we need to push a fix,
how fast can we do it, and who has

337
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:11,449
the authority and ability to do that?

338
00:19:11,949 --> 00:19:13,759
Make sure you find a
process that works for you.

339
00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:16,452
A tip on how to get started.

340
00:19:16,452 --> 00:19:17,704
What would you do?

341
00:19:17,994 --> 00:19:21,544
On an incident case, you should
start evaluating that first and

342
00:19:21,544 --> 00:19:24,204
then you can practice around that.

343
00:19:24,704 --> 00:19:28,994
Step three, you should make sure
that you find ways to tune your

344
00:19:28,994 --> 00:19:30,624
processes for your teams to work.

345
00:19:30,954 --> 00:19:34,964
Here you are working for process
improvements, stakeholder

346
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:38,534
expectations, disruptions and
stuff that might trickle down the

347
00:19:38,534 --> 00:19:40,864
responders or rise up to stakeholders.

348
00:19:41,364 --> 00:19:43,354
Step four, make checklists.

349
00:19:43,884 --> 00:19:47,054
Make a checklist that you can run
through when an incident happens to make

350
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:48,614
sure that you have everything covered.

351
00:19:49,114 --> 00:19:51,524
You can think about
airplanes, for instance.

352
00:19:51,694 --> 00:19:54,154
Pilots literally have
a pre flight checklist.

353
00:19:54,604 --> 00:19:58,764
And no matter how many times they've
flown in their careers, how much

354
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:02,964
experience they have, they have, they
are legally have to go through this

355
00:20:02,965 --> 00:20:06,064
list and they make sure that every
item is completed and ticked off.

356
00:20:06,564 --> 00:20:08,254
The truth is, people will make mistakes.

357
00:20:08,264 --> 00:20:09,564
It's in our nature.

358
00:20:09,794 --> 00:20:12,414
Especially when we are stressing,
we tend to forget stuff.

359
00:20:12,734 --> 00:20:16,434
So the best way to mitigate
this risk is to have a list.

360
00:20:17,154 --> 00:20:21,154
the list also helps to work pause
points in your process, so that

361
00:20:21,164 --> 00:20:26,114
everyone has a chance to take a breath,
relax, and continue to do the work

362
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:27,694
in a calm environment without panic.

363
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:32,644
So These are actual checklists
that we have at PagerDuty when

364
00:20:32,644 --> 00:20:33,954
we have high severity incidents.

365
00:20:34,254 --> 00:20:37,724
I'm not going to dictate this to you, you
can take a screenshot now, you can access

366
00:20:37,724 --> 00:20:39,864
the slides afterwards, I'm sharing them.

367
00:20:40,204 --> 00:20:44,734
The key message is that these seem like
very easy, simple steps that we won't

368
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:49,164
forget, but during times in panic,
it's very easy to miss some of them.

369
00:20:49,654 --> 00:20:54,274
Checklists will reduce the mental strain
on you and will have a large impact when.

370
00:20:54,914 --> 00:21:00,734
Stuff happens and last but not
least do your post mortems or

371
00:21:00,764 --> 00:21:02,974
post incident reviews here.

372
00:21:02,974 --> 00:21:06,264
You should review what happened during
the incident, both for insights of

373
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:10,294
where our engineering practices need to
be improved, but also for insights on

374
00:21:10,584 --> 00:21:13,134
where our incident response process was.

375
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:14,279
not clear.

376
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:18,499
The reason why our incident response
process has been so successful throughout

377
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:22,609
the years is because we have iterated it
over time, and we still continue to do it.

378
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:26,929
People get together after incidents,
we discuss what happened, and we create

379
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:30,699
an organized approach to an emergency
situation and tailor it to our needs.

380
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:34,509
Because of this, we are, we now
have a consistent and unified

381
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:35,869
approach to incident response.

382
00:21:36,699 --> 00:21:38,329
Please, that's very important.

383
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,319
Don't miss.

384
00:21:39,774 --> 00:21:40,614
Post incident reviews.

385
00:21:41,114 --> 00:21:46,264
Okay, now you have all the steps
to deal with incident response, but

386
00:21:46,274 --> 00:21:47,624
sometimes stuff is going to happen.

387
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:49,864
There are going to be issues,
there are going to be pains, and

388
00:21:49,864 --> 00:21:50,714
we're going to have pitfalls.

389
00:21:51,084 --> 00:21:53,834
So we're going to take a few
minutes now to talk about other

390
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:55,054
pitfalls we've come across.

391
00:21:55,554 --> 00:21:59,204
The first one, and a very common
one, it's called Executive Swoop.

392
00:21:59,704 --> 00:22:02,944
Well, it's actually Executive
Swoop and Poop, but I was asked

393
00:22:02,994 --> 00:22:04,374
not to put that on the slide.

394
00:22:04,894 --> 00:22:08,284
So we're gonna look at some more common
examples of Executive Swoop next.

395
00:22:08,784 --> 00:22:12,614
One thing that's important to
note in here is that None of

396
00:22:12,804 --> 00:22:14,514
these things happen maliciously.

397
00:22:14,954 --> 00:22:18,194
No executive will join the meeting
with the intent of messing up

398
00:22:18,194 --> 00:22:19,864
the process or delaying stuff.

399
00:22:20,264 --> 00:22:23,434
They are there to try to motivate
people, find out what's going on,

400
00:22:23,464 --> 00:22:24,874
and make sure the issue is gone.

401
00:22:25,234 --> 00:22:26,304
It's their business too.

402
00:22:26,504 --> 00:22:28,724
So, let's look at some common examples.

403
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:33,074
First one, an executive comes in and
says, Okay, everyone, let's try and

404
00:22:33,074 --> 00:22:35,054
resolve this in 10 minutes, please.

405
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:40,139
And on the surface this might seem
pretty okay, pretty unharmful.

406
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,779
The executive is just there to try
to motivate everyone and encourage us

407
00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:46,839
to solve the problem quickly, right?

408
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:50,249
Well, unfortunately that's not
how it's going to be perceived.

409
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:54,749
Saying something like this assumes
that people aren't already working as

410
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:56,369
hard as possible to solve the problem.

411
00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:00,239
It's not by if I'm going trying
to fix an issue for the past two

412
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:03,339
hours and someone comes in and says
Okay, let's try to make sure this is

413
00:23:03,339 --> 00:23:07,439
wrapped up in ten minutes that I'm
Gonna fix it in 10 minutes, right?

414
00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:11,119
This will just demotivate me
and add additional stress.

415
00:23:11,569 --> 00:23:16,679
The job of the incident commander here
is to step in and try to clarify that.

416
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:17,849
Okay, calm down.

417
00:23:17,869 --> 00:23:21,349
We are doing the best we can
during our time and let's

418
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:22,569
try to keep things on track.

419
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,699
Another executive swoop that happened.

420
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:29,549
An executive turns the call and they
ask for a list of impacted customers.

421
00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:31,599
There is just a problem with this.

422
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:33,539
I understand that you might need it, but.

423
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:38,549
For us to do this, and to get this
list, we'll need to take someone away

424
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:42,079
from the effort of responding to this
incident when we need them the most.

425
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:46,869
So, let's just not let the executive
know that this is happening,

426
00:23:46,939 --> 00:23:48,529
and that we cannot do this.

427
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:49,469
Third one.

428
00:23:49,984 --> 00:23:53,944
Often times the executive will hop
on an incident response call and

429
00:23:53,954 --> 00:23:57,404
begin asking a lot of questions
around the specific impact.

430
00:23:57,824 --> 00:24:01,584
And sometimes they'll ask you for
something large and time consuming.

431
00:24:02,094 --> 00:24:04,304
And they'll just say, okay, do what I say.

432
00:24:04,604 --> 00:24:08,154
Well, this is where the
incident commander comes in.

433
00:24:08,654 --> 00:24:10,904
You just ask them, do
you wish to take command?

434
00:24:11,404 --> 00:24:14,114
And you should see how often
they don't answer with yes.

435
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:18,539
If they do, great, okay, the incident
commander says, okay, everyone, be

436
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:23,139
advised, I'm handing over to this
person, I'm out, but most of the time

437
00:24:23,139 --> 00:24:25,209
people say no, or won't even answer.

438
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:31,309
In which case, the incident commander
keeps the processes going as usual, and

439
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,429
they can even say, in that case, remember,
I'm in command of this incident, please

440
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:37,359
save your discussion for after the call.

441
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:38,769
Executive swoop happens.

442
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:43,809
Because one thing, which is most of
times failure to notify stakeholders,

443
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:47,679
you should keep your stakeholders
informed on a regular cadence.

444
00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:49,199
Transparency is key.

445
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:52,339
It will help ensure that people
and other executives don't

446
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:53,469
need to join the incident call.

447
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,749
And it will also allow the stakeholders
to field questions from customers

448
00:24:57,769 --> 00:24:59,389
so that your team isn't interrupted.

449
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:03,199
This gives your organization confidence
enough that the situation is under

450
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:05,409
control and that you can take it.

451
00:25:05,739 --> 00:25:06,679
It's very important.

452
00:25:06,689 --> 00:25:10,199
This is why it's important to have
all those channels and those internal

453
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:11,829
liaisons communicating stuff.

454
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,879
If everyone has the right information that
they need, then most of the times they

455
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:18,219
won't feel the need to hop on into a call.

456
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:21,749
Now, one step that's important to What?

457
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:22,389
Not one step.

458
00:25:22,389 --> 00:25:26,239
One thing that's important to avoid
is having too much status updates.

459
00:25:26,739 --> 00:25:30,329
The If you keep giving too many
stats updates, most of the times

460
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:32,699
they are unnecessary and they
are wasting people's times.

461
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:38,459
We like to keep internal updates,
to every 30 minutes or immediately

462
00:25:38,469 --> 00:25:42,329
after a change occurs, either it
being an improvement or a resolution.

463
00:25:42,829 --> 00:25:46,329
Now, another mistake that often
happens as well is read hearings.

464
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:51,009
These are things like, clues that
are misleading or distracting.

465
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:56,439
For example, we have been on calls where
people, and when everyone is convinced

466
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:58,779
that the issue is with the network.

467
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:03,456
However, after some of the times
people, after a couple of times,

468
00:26:03,456 --> 00:26:07,909
minutes, I mean, people realized that
they hadn't checked recent deploys.

469
00:26:08,409 --> 00:26:12,139
And, surprise, surprise, the source
of the problem was in a code change.

470
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:14,109
Which, they often are.

471
00:26:14,689 --> 00:26:19,209
So don't get sucked into obsessively
following one line investigations and

472
00:26:19,209 --> 00:26:20,679
miss the true cause of the incident.

473
00:26:21,459 --> 00:26:26,089
This is where the incident commander needs
to keep in check and keep asking questions

474
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:30,849
and encouraging the team to step back
from just focusing on one small situation

475
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:32,629
and look at all the options at hand.

476
00:26:33,129 --> 00:26:36,769
So there are other common pitfalls
that I won't go over because this

477
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:41,769
will turn this talk very, very
long, but here are some of them.

478
00:26:41,879 --> 00:26:44,949
So, debating the severity of
an incident during the call.

479
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:48,159
You don't want to stop what you're
doing to discuss the severity.

480
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:52,509
If you're already going with it, assume
that's the severity you're treating

481
00:26:52,539 --> 00:26:55,979
and do the process as you should,
and then do the post mortem review.

482
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:59,609
Then discussing process
and policy decisions.

483
00:27:00,544 --> 00:27:03,164
Once again, not the time, not the place.

484
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:06,504
This is why it's important that
everyone knows and is on the same page.

485
00:27:06,884 --> 00:27:10,744
Once again, if this happens During
the post incident review, make

486
00:27:10,744 --> 00:27:12,324
sure that everyone is aligned.

487
00:27:12,824 --> 00:27:15,534
Then, not disseminating policy changes.

488
00:27:15,824 --> 00:27:18,634
This is something that can happen,
so if changes happen and people

489
00:27:18,684 --> 00:27:22,154
are not informed, this will lead
to another of this, the one,

490
00:27:22,194 --> 00:27:23,724
some of the previous stuff here.

491
00:27:24,224 --> 00:27:26,634
Hesitating to escalate
to other responders.

492
00:27:26,714 --> 00:27:34,094
This happens often when subject matter
experts can be Scared or afraid of

493
00:27:34,764 --> 00:27:38,794
meaning that they don't know how to deal
the problem to deal with the problem.

494
00:27:38,804 --> 00:27:45,294
The issue is this is often a sign of
a culture where people are afraid to

495
00:27:45,794 --> 00:27:48,014
step up and admit that they don't know.

496
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:51,609
If you disseminate the right
culture and the right practices

497
00:27:51,609 --> 00:27:52,739
and people know that, okay.

498
00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:56,409
It's not not knowing, it's basically
figuring out if I don't know how

499
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:59,139
to handle this, I'm gonna pass
it to someone who knows how to

500
00:27:59,139 --> 00:28:00,589
handle this situation and fix it.

501
00:28:01,089 --> 00:28:04,109
Then, neglecting the post incident
review and follow up activities.

502
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:08,409
This one speaks for itself,
trying to take on multiple roles.

503
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:12,559
So, an incident commander
should be an incident commander.

504
00:28:12,629 --> 00:28:15,279
A subject matter expert should
be a subject matter expert.

505
00:28:15,379 --> 00:28:17,999
The customer liaison should
be the customer liaison.

506
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:21,069
So it's important that
everyone knows their roles.

507
00:28:21,749 --> 00:28:24,529
there are situations where this
might depend, but most of the

508
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:29,299
times, it shouldn't happen where
one person has one more task.

509
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:32,389
Then, stopping everything and
getting everyone on the call.

510
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:33,619
So, all hands on deck.

511
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:36,869
Let's get everyone together in
the same call and try to fix this.

512
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:38,509
Well, you don't want this to happen.

513
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:39,309
You want to have chaos.

514
00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:41,899
You should only have the people
there in this discussion that

515
00:28:42,339 --> 00:28:44,119
can and will contribute to it.

516
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:49,329
And everyone else can be updated
towards following the channel.

517
00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:53,239
notes being taken by described
another thing, forcing

518
00:28:53,249 --> 00:28:54,489
everyone to stay on the call.

519
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:58,919
So you don't want people to stay
on the instant response call.

520
00:28:59,384 --> 00:29:02,184
If they don't need to be there,
they're not contributing.

521
00:29:02,184 --> 00:29:04,564
Most of the time, these
discussions happen at three or 4am.

522
00:29:04,614 --> 00:29:09,604
If these people are not, they're
doing anything anymore, release

523
00:29:09,604 --> 00:29:13,284
them, let them go have their rest
or focus on their own other things.

524
00:29:13,634 --> 00:29:17,174
They can check up on what happened
afterwards and then other stuff.

525
00:29:17,224 --> 00:29:19,994
Assuming that silence means
that there are no progress.

526
00:29:20,494 --> 00:29:22,604
Most of the time, just because
people are quiet doesn't mean

527
00:29:22,604 --> 00:29:23,734
that stuff is not happening.

528
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:26,924
People are working on stuff, they
are fixing their issues, they

529
00:29:26,924 --> 00:29:30,054
are fixing the issue the best
they know, they're doing stuff.

530
00:29:30,154 --> 00:29:32,524
Obviously, there's going to be times
where you need to keep the updates,

531
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:36,294
but don't assume that if people
are quiet, nothing is happening.

532
00:29:36,794 --> 00:29:43,214
So, in summary of everything we've
seen in this talk is this one.

533
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:47,604
So first, use the incident command
system for managing your incidents.

534
00:29:48,104 --> 00:29:51,754
Third, second, make sure that there's
an incident commander that can take

535
00:29:51,754 --> 00:29:54,964
charge during emergency scenarios.

536
00:29:55,464 --> 00:29:57,644
Make sure that expectations are set.

537
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:02,139
Upwards that your stakeholders and
everyone in the company, high level

538
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:05,469
chiefs and levels know how stuff works.

539
00:30:05,969 --> 00:30:10,769
Work with your team to set explicit,
explicit processes and expectations.

540
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:15,399
Once again, expectations are the most
important thing during incidents.

541
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:21,099
Everyone needs to know what, how,
what to do, how to react and what,

542
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,059
how they should carry themselves.

543
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:25,619
Practice, practice, practice.

544
00:30:26,249 --> 00:30:31,819
Like I said, a firefighter that only
fought one or two small fires is not

545
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:35,829
gonna know how to handle a huge one, so
you need to keep practicing and figuring

546
00:30:35,829 --> 00:30:40,009
out how you and your team carries
themselves when major incidents show up.

547
00:30:40,749 --> 00:30:45,009
And finally, Don't forget to review
your processes and keep improving.

548
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:50,059
So if you want to get more details on
incident response and this process,

549
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:54,389
this session only covered a bit of the
beginning on stuff we have documented

550
00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:57,369
on our operations guide that PagerDuty.

551
00:30:57,369 --> 00:30:58,579
So you can check the response.

552
00:30:58,579 --> 00:30:59,099
pagerduty.

553
00:30:59,469 --> 00:31:04,159
com to get more information,
learn more about the processes.

554
00:31:04,619 --> 00:31:08,824
this is an open source guide that is
just It isn't specific on to PagerDuty.

555
00:31:08,854 --> 00:31:13,224
Many components companies have taken
segments of our guide and inserted

556
00:31:13,224 --> 00:31:14,544
it in their own documentations.

557
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,384
besides that, we have plenty
other operations guide

558
00:31:17,384 --> 00:31:18,734
that you can run and check.

559
00:31:18,734 --> 00:31:22,764
So stuff like post incident reviews,
operational reviews, full service

560
00:31:22,764 --> 00:31:25,044
ownership, so can go ahead and check them.

561
00:31:25,654 --> 00:31:28,354
you can also connect with
us@community.pager.com,

562
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:30,214
so our pager com and it's.

563
00:31:30,994 --> 00:31:33,954
Where everyone can go ahead and ask
questions, talk about PagerDuty,

564
00:31:34,274 --> 00:31:38,824
developer operations, anything you
find relevant, go ahead and you can

565
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:41,284
check it, so there's this QR code
that you can scan to take you there.

It's been a pleasure to be
here talking with everyone.

571
00:31:57,904 --> 00:32:01,034
And hopefully now by the end of this
talk, you know that you don't need to

572
00:32:01,034 --> 00:32:04,834
panic and you have some insights on how
to have an effective incident response.

573
00:32:05,364 --> 00:32:06,084
I'm Daniel Alfonso.

574
00:32:06,334 --> 00:32:07,624
