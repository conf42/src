00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,870
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:01,680
Welcome.

3
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,360
I'm Baba Prasad Penola and I
work as a staff technical program

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,860
manager at Walmart Global Tech.

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,760
Today I am excited to talk to
you about powered AI building

6
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,500
enterprise cloud platforms.

7
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,570
Our discussion will focus on
the intersection of AI and cloud

8
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,820
infrastructure with a unique lens
on how the go programming language

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,220
powers AI at enterprise scale.

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,400
Let's ground ourselves first.

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,750
AI is transforming
enterprise cloud computing.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,300
It's enabling automation.

13
00:00:36,449 --> 00:00:42,559
It is helping us to have real
time analytics and enabling us

14
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,750
to ha take intelligent decisions.

15
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:52,005
It enhances scalability, optimizes
resource utilization, and also improves

16
00:00:52,324 --> 00:00:54,995
security posture with air driven insights.

17
00:00:55,575 --> 00:01:00,855
Enterprises are now able to
streamline operations, cut

18
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:02,685
costs, and drive innovation.

19
00:01:03,185 --> 00:01:08,825
Today, the unique focus would be on
how GOs performance characteristics

20
00:01:09,365 --> 00:01:14,735
make it an ideal foundation for
building these AI driven platforms.

21
00:01:15,235 --> 00:01:22,160
Let's know what Go is GOs compile
Nature lightweight con via go routines.

22
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,630
And efficient memory handling
make it perfectly suited for

23
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,050
scalable real time AI workloads.

24
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:38,090
It allows us to build robust fault
tolerant platforms that drive

25
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:44,420
efficiency automation, and helps us to
take intelligent decisions at scale.

26
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,840
Now let's do a deep drive.

27
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,100
Go plus ai, the perfect match.

28
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,760
Let's talk or let's explore why
GO and AI are a natural page

29
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,920
for modern cloud environments.

30
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,010
Go and ai.

31
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:05,890
Why are the perfect match for
building efficient, scalable,

32
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,839
and resilient cloud platforms?

33
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,434
Let's talk about the strengths
of go performance and efficiency.

34
00:02:13,214 --> 00:02:20,984
Its garbage collection is optimized
and the compiled nature, it gives us a

35
00:02:20,984 --> 00:02:23,914
near sea level speed concurrency model.

36
00:02:24,784 --> 00:02:30,454
Core routines and channels offer
lightweight parallel processing, perfect

37
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,214
for training or serving AI models.

38
00:02:33,724 --> 00:02:37,774
Scalability Go is bond for microservices.

39
00:02:38,494 --> 00:02:40,144
Its minimal overhead.

40
00:02:40,144 --> 00:02:41,944
Makes it ideal for.

41
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:45,214
Scalable modular AI services.

42
00:02:45,754 --> 00:02:51,684
Now let's look at the AI requirements,
high throughput data pipelines, which

43
00:02:51,684 --> 00:02:58,464
helps for processing large volumes of
streaming data, scalable microservices.

44
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:03,804
It enables and helps us to
distribute workloads across

45
00:03:03,804 --> 00:03:06,594
clusters fault tolerant operations.

46
00:03:07,094 --> 00:03:12,795
It helps the system to self-heal
or recover gracefully in

47
00:03:12,795 --> 00:03:15,374
case of any adverse events.

48
00:03:15,944 --> 00:03:22,754
So the conclusion here is very clear,
goes architecture aligns beautifully

49
00:03:23,265 --> 00:03:26,075
with what modern AI platforms need.

50
00:03:26,734 --> 00:03:27,845
Let's get to the next slide.

51
00:03:28,345 --> 00:03:31,125
What is the enterprise impact we have now?

52
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:36,605
When you put these things into
practice, what do we actually see?

53
00:03:37,535 --> 00:03:40,715
A 42% reduction in system failures.

54
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:47,215
Thanks to proactive monitoring and
AI powered health checks, a 37%

55
00:03:47,215 --> 00:03:49,435
improvement in resource utilization.

56
00:03:50,155 --> 00:03:54,745
AI helps balance workloads
dynamically, which is helping us to

57
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,440
improve the resource utilization.

58
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,685
A 68% success rate in AI implementation.

59
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:06,365
When organization adopt
structured governance model.

60
00:04:06,865 --> 00:04:08,455
This is a super number.

61
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:11,185
These numbers aren't hypothetical.

62
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:14,725
They are real examples from
production environment.

63
00:04:15,415 --> 00:04:21,355
The key takeaway from here is go powered
AI platforms are not only stable.

64
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:26,590
But also more cost effective
and easier to maintain.

65
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,480
Let's get into the next slide.

66
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,180
Technical integration.

67
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,700
Now, what is needed to make it all work?

68
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,200
Let's now talk about how we
actually implement these systems.

69
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,810
What are the key components we have?

70
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:46,690
There are four key components,
the Go Platform, AI libraries.

71
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:53,470
Operational tools, and most importantly,
the business value Now core platform,

72
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,320
which is going to be your core
engine optimized microservices.

73
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,950
They use containerized go services
to achieve blazing fast AI pipelines.

74
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:12,765
High performance APIs go allows us
to expose endpoints with low latency.

75
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:19,560
Critical for inference AI libraries, which
is going to be your intelligence layer.

76
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:26,130
TensorFlow and Onyx Go has strong
bindings to these frameworks for

77
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,400
model execution ETL pipelines.

78
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,340
You can build memory efficient
ingestion pipelines with native go

79
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:41,160
libraries operational tools, which is
going to be the strong control system.

80
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,950
Monitoring and logging real
time observability ensures

81
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:51,230
that both data pipelines and AI
models, they behave predictably.

82
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:58,720
Governance built in compliance
features help track how models

83
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,105
behave and how decisions are made.

84
00:06:01,645 --> 00:06:06,265
So a well integrated GO AI system.

85
00:06:06,745 --> 00:06:11,425
It is not only fast, but
also reliable and auditable.

86
00:06:11,925 --> 00:06:16,475
The last one, which is not the
least one, the most important one.

87
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,035
Why it matters.

88
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:20,495
Why should enterprises care?

89
00:06:21,485 --> 00:06:29,105
Because with Go powered AI systems,
we unlock tangible business value.

90
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:35,000
S meaning increased efficiency
or improved efficiency.

91
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:43,520
Faster model performance means real
time insights, reduced costs, so less

92
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,265
compute overhead, and smarter scaling
will lead to lower cloud builds.

93
00:06:50,765 --> 00:06:52,445
Improved decision making.

94
00:06:53,015 --> 00:06:56,885
AI pipelines integrated
with business logic.

95
00:06:57,385 --> 00:07:02,515
It helps us enable proactive rather
than the reactive strategies.

96
00:07:02,995 --> 00:07:09,085
So goal isn't just a technical
tool, it's a business accelerator.

97
00:07:09,585 --> 00:07:14,315
Now what are the skills that is
required for success now to build

98
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:16,115
these platforms successfully?

99
00:07:16,615 --> 00:07:21,290
Organizations need the right
blend of talent and strategy.

100
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,890
So three key components here.

101
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,780
AI governance, ethical
AI is no longer optional.

102
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:34,780
Teams need to build frameworks that
ensure transparency and fairness.

103
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:43,930
Integration patterns, architecture must
support modularity, performance and scale.

104
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,445
The last one, go Expertise.

105
00:07:46,945 --> 00:07:51,865
We should ensure that the engineers
need to understand the go routines,

106
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:57,805
the concurrency and memory profiling
to fully unlock go's power.

107
00:07:58,305 --> 00:08:02,655
It's not about just writing the
code, it's about writing the

108
00:08:02,655 --> 00:08:06,014
right code at scale responsibly.

109
00:08:06,514 --> 00:08:08,484
Now, what is the.

110
00:08:08,574 --> 00:08:12,804
A framework that is
available for GO Native ai.

111
00:08:13,304 --> 00:08:14,594
Let's talk about tooling now.

112
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:22,234
How do we actually enable all this now
inference libraries Go NAV supports high

113
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:30,064
performance bindings for tensor flow and
onyx making model deployments seamless.

114
00:08:30,564 --> 00:08:34,164
There are also lightweight
go native implementations.

115
00:08:34,689 --> 00:08:43,089
For Lean Edge or microservice inference
data processing with go, you can build

116
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:49,629
parallel ETL pipelines and stream
processing that auto scales with traffic.

117
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:55,179
You get specialized structures to
handle AI workloads efficiently.

118
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:03,324
AI integration GO has robust
connectors to AWS Azure and GCP.

119
00:09:04,134 --> 00:09:06,864
And it also supports
multi-cloud architecture.

120
00:09:07,364 --> 00:09:13,035
You can implement fallbacks,
throttling, and abstraction layers

121
00:09:13,454 --> 00:09:15,464
for resilience and portability.

122
00:09:16,395 --> 00:09:21,485
So these native frameworks are
what turn go from a language

123
00:09:21,545 --> 00:09:23,795
into a true AI platform.

124
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:25,494
Let's get into the next slide.

125
00:09:25,994 --> 00:09:28,364
Healthcare study Now.

126
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,400
Let's look at a real world case.

127
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:38,640
Healthcare iot devices capture
real time patient vitals.

128
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,140
Now, AI models running
on a go powered backend.

129
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,990
Analyze this data continuously.

130
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,800
Health practitioners, they receive
evidence-based recommendations with

131
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,380
probability scores for personalized care.

132
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:01,150
Over time, the platform learns from
outcomes, improving future predictions.

133
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:08,530
This isn't just a theory, it's happening
now and it's changing how we deliver care.

134
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,120
I, so let's get into the next slide.

135
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,730
What are the clinical
results that we have now?

136
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,260
What is the measurable impact?

137
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,380
Here are the results from the GO AI
implementation in the healthcare system.

138
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:29,100
A 42% reduction in readmission
rates, so people are more healthier.

139
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:37,480
21% improvement in diagnostic
accuracy, a 72% fever adverse event.

140
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:43,230
So when we get to know what's
happening, we can have strategic plans.

141
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:50,969
So that is helping us to reduce adverse
event, a 73% faster decision making.

142
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:52,829
What needs to be done?

143
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:57,620
So intelligent decision making is 73%.

144
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,670
These metrics show how technology
can move the needle, not just for

145
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,685
operations, but for human lives as well.

146
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:09,265
So AI plus Go.

147
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:14,064
Isn't just about uptime,
it's about impact.

148
00:11:14,725 --> 00:11:15,895
Let's get into the next slide.

149
00:11:16,395 --> 00:11:18,224
Complimentary intelligence.

150
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:22,594
Now, complimentary
intelligence, human plus ai.

151
00:11:22,655 --> 00:11:25,110
I want to emphasize
something important here.

152
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,224
The future isn't human or ai.

153
00:11:29,944 --> 00:11:31,925
It's human and ai.

154
00:11:32,645 --> 00:11:34,594
Now, human expertise brings.

155
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:35,930
Intuition.

156
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:37,969
Ethical reasoning.

157
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:40,249
Contextual knowledge.

158
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:47,569
Now, AI processing brings
pattern recognition speed scale.

159
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:54,194
The best results come from collaborative
decision making and continuous learning

160
00:11:55,045 --> 00:11:58,114
where human insights refine AI models.

161
00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:02,089
And AI insights empower humans.

162
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:10,069
So together we make smarter,
safer, and more balanced decisions.

163
00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:15,390
Now, organizational readiness,
technical infrastructure assessment.

164
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:19,519
So before we get into that.

165
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,259
Here's how to assess if
the A is ready or not.

166
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:30,439
Technical infrastructure, evaluate
systems, evaluate data pipelines and

167
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:32,979
skill level governance framework.

168
00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:38,889
Set clear rules for ai, behavior,
compliance, and accountability.

169
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:40,439
Pilot projects.

170
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,050
Let's have small projects.

171
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:43,889
Let's start.

172
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:46,170
Prove the value fast.

173
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:53,060
It helps us to take the decisions,
enterprise wide deployment, rollout in

174
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,199
