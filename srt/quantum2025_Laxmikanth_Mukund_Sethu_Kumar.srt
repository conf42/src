00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,290
Hello all.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,220
Good morning.

3
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,300
Good afternoon, and good evening.

4
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,640
This is Lex McCann Kumar, an executive
Director at JPMorgan Chase Bank.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,280
This is for Con 42 Quantum Computing
2025 event, and the topic is bridging

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,140
classical and quantum computing.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,080
Let's start with a quote.

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,620
Quantum Computing is not going
to be a replacement for the

9
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,000
classical com completing.

10
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,490
It's rather it's a transformation.

11
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:29,020
Classical to comp quantum
computing and how we use it.

12
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,580
So the kind of fundamentals is
your mind mindset should shift

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,020
considering it as a co-existence
instead of as a competition between

14
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,460
the classical and quantum computing.

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:47,070
The reality is the shift is real and there
are already major players like A-W-S-I-B-M

16
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,170
and Azure have quantum computing areas.

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,150
Example as the A WS bracket, IBM,
quantum and Azure Quantum, and there are

18
00:00:55,150 --> 00:01:00,400
almost more than a hundred plus quantum
related patents filed in 2023 alone.

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,960
And there are many startups and
enterprises, r and Ds prototyping,

20
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,810
hybrid workflows between the
classical and a quantum computer.

21
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,990
It started with as a theory and it has
become a lab and now it's all cloud native

22
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,790
APOs available for quantum computing.

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,830
And these are all the proof points.

24
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,610
And let's think about what's between
the classical and the quantum

25
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,750
and what are the emerging needs.

26
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,230
The classical system is well known
for its performance, optimization,

27
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,610
security, and reliability.

28
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,170
The emerging needs, while we are
shipping or running in a hybrid

29
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:37,160
model of classical and quantum, would
be quantum for the combin material

30
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,880
optimization, machine learning
acceleration, and molecule simulation.

31
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,210
We need to have an interface to.

32
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:47,635
Have the classical event talked
to the quantum, using the driven

33
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:53,605
event driven pipelines, and to start
with, for enterprise architect to

34
00:01:53,605 --> 00:01:55,615
know how and what needs to be done.

35
00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:58,435
Here are some of the fundamentals
that we need to think about.

36
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:03,135
So the quantum 1 0 1 for classical
architectures, the quantum core

37
00:02:03,135 --> 00:02:07,365
principles is about qubits,
super position, entanglement and

38
00:02:07,365 --> 00:02:10,035
interference, and we need to understand.

39
00:02:10,535 --> 00:02:15,335
The classical computing works on
binary, which are zeros or one, but the

40
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:19,895
quantum is, can have a state which is
simultaneously either a zero and a one.

41
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:24,695
So it's also more than more
as a probabilistic state

42
00:02:24,815 --> 00:02:26,435
than as a binary state.

43
00:02:27,185 --> 00:02:31,055
So your our thinking thought process
should change, of considering a

44
00:02:31,055 --> 00:02:36,375
status as either or for as a binary
instead as a probabilistic state.

45
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:41,285
Next, what are all the challenges
we have in this journey of com?

46
00:02:41,345 --> 00:02:43,325
Starting from the classical
to the quantum computing?

47
00:02:44,135 --> 00:02:47,885
So the current state of the
quantum computing doesn't fit

48
00:02:47,885 --> 00:02:49,565
into our existing DevOps stacks.

49
00:02:49,954 --> 00:02:55,715
Major missing pieces are the job
orchestration, state isolation for quantum

50
00:02:55,715 --> 00:02:57,875
workloads, and also the latency tolerance.

51
00:02:58,474 --> 00:03:02,944
So these are the problems that needs
to be solved, but I'm sure in the near

52
00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:07,244
future it'll be eventually solved and
it will be in a very mature state.

53
00:03:07,744 --> 00:03:12,574
The next thing, let's talk about how a
hybrid architecture for a quantum and

54
00:03:12,574 --> 00:03:14,374
a classical computing works together.

55
00:03:15,004 --> 00:03:19,144
So your application layer, the first
tier could be all microservices with

56
00:03:19,144 --> 00:03:24,154
the APIs and in your middle tier or
your orchestration layer could be

57
00:03:24,154 --> 00:03:26,314
for quantum job routers and cubes.

58
00:03:27,214 --> 00:03:30,884
And the lower backend services
could be, classical computing

59
00:03:30,884 --> 00:03:35,254
and also quantum computing, or a
combination of both of them together.

60
00:03:35,754 --> 00:03:40,144
So overall, still the problem for
quantum not fitting into the DevOps stack

61
00:03:40,144 --> 00:03:45,254
is there, but still these models are
workable and there are prototypes and

62
00:03:45,494 --> 00:03:47,544
solutions being done based on this model.

63
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:50,144
Next, the major design patterns.

64
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:53,894
What we need to consider for our
quantum computing area would be

65
00:03:54,045 --> 00:03:58,814
quantum as a service, just like we have
infrastructure as a service, software as

66
00:03:58,814 --> 00:04:00,434
a service, and everything as a service.

67
00:04:00,884 --> 00:04:04,785
Quantum as a service is another same
pattern that's primarily being considered.

68
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:08,564
And also we have to consider all
the quantum triggers from the

69
00:04:08,564 --> 00:04:10,964
classical event cues like a calf cup.

70
00:04:11,174 --> 00:04:14,324
So when we club between the
classical and the quantum.

71
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,809
The communication medium could be a
popup model where the classical can be

72
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:22,539
producing an event to which a quantum
needs to react based on the event

73
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:24,099
that has, that classical has produced.

74
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,460
And we also need to be
predominantly working on the server

75
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,960
serverless, quantum microservices.

76
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:35,175
That's like a cell lambda, what we
have a lambda can trigger AWS bracket.

77
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:39,455
Next the middleware integration layer,
what we talked about earlier the main

78
00:04:39,455 --> 00:04:43,415
responsibilities for those area will
be on the session management job cuing,

79
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:46,145
and the error ries result normalization.

80
00:04:47,015 --> 00:04:52,175
So the strategy would be to solve
this problem area to decouple the

81
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:54,125
quantum logic from the orchestra logic.

82
00:04:54,155 --> 00:04:57,765
So we should not combine them
as a single com computation.

83
00:04:57,825 --> 00:05:02,675
Instead, it should be a two different
segregation of duty and major tools as

84
00:05:02,675 --> 00:05:07,425
I mentioned earlier that would be used
would be the a s bracket, SDK, the on

85
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:14,124
time ci, GRPC and bridgers, and many
more out there in the queue Now with.

86
00:05:14,874 --> 00:05:18,584
Cloud Naivity being the
forerunner at this point of time.

87
00:05:19,074 --> 00:05:22,854
The cloud native abstraction for
the quantum area could be in the

88
00:05:22,854 --> 00:05:26,424
areas of like containers running
quantum for local simulations.

89
00:05:26,874 --> 00:05:31,354
Or you can have a ka jobs runners
which can orchestrate your quantum

90
00:05:31,694 --> 00:05:34,244
flows and your serverless options.

91
00:05:34,814 --> 00:05:36,944
As I mentioned earlier, the A DW Lambda.

92
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:42,489
Along with the bracket trigger and
the DevOps quantum job linking CA

93
00:05:42,489 --> 00:05:44,349
CD4 quantum kernels in the future.

94
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:47,739
So these are the cloud native
abstraction that needs to be considered.

95
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:54,099
And the more important thing of whether
it is a classical or a quantum, would be

96
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:59,579
on the security interoperability, abso
and security, as I as mentioned in the

97
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:03,169
slide, you can see the authentication
across classical and quantum.

98
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:03,739
Ty should be.

99
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,079
We taken care very well.

100
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:06,609
It should be a zero trust model.

101
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:10,659
The interoperability between the
classical and the quantum would be

102
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:15,909
the protocol Standard issues like the
QAR and the open quo vendor neutral

103
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:19,844
interfaces are very important for the
interoperability will be much easier and

104
00:06:19,844 --> 00:06:23,864
the observability will be for telemetry
for the quantum jobs and the integration

105
00:06:23,864 --> 00:06:27,284
with the Prometheus and open telemetry,
just like how we have integrated them

106
00:06:27,284 --> 00:06:28,394
in the classical computing today.

107
00:06:28,894 --> 00:06:32,044
Here is a practical roadmap for
the enterprises to consider.

108
00:06:32,914 --> 00:06:37,714
First, the step one would be identifying
the quantum able problems, like

109
00:06:37,714 --> 00:06:41,894
example, like a scheduling machine,
learning model, tuning and more.

110
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:46,724
And the step two, after once we have
identified, is to build a dev sandbox

111
00:06:46,994 --> 00:06:49,214
for the emulators for the quantum.

112
00:06:49,964 --> 00:06:53,444
And once the emulators are
already, the third step would be to

113
00:06:53,444 --> 00:06:55,604
integrate with chop orchestration.

114
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,179
Message buses.

115
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:02,069
So this message I mentioned earlier
will be the one we should be to

116
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:05,219
come a hybrid communication between
the classic and the quantum.

117
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:10,279
And the step four would be to come to
the pilot state where we have a hybrid

118
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:15,769
service, non-critical, in a non-critical
path, and gradually promotion towards

119
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:18,019
the production workflows as a step five.

120
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,229
And that will be Itrate next future.

121
00:07:20,829 --> 00:07:22,659
Now, once we have all this in.

122
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:27,754
Happening in our hybrid model the
end state or the future state.

123
00:07:28,154 --> 00:07:34,754
To have a non-destructive strategy would
be to have how we integrate modularly

124
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:39,614
or adapt layers to existing system,
and at the same time minimize the risk

125
00:07:39,614 --> 00:07:42,284
using the polyglot as DGen simulators.

126
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:45,574
As well as a mature
hybrid, CACD pipelines.

127
00:07:46,504 --> 00:07:50,074
So the goal would be to experiment
without rewriting the stack.

128
00:07:50,614 --> 00:07:55,804
We should be maturing into the stage where
this hybrid model will works well or any

129
00:07:55,864 --> 00:07:57,154
problems that will, we want to solve.

130
00:07:58,084 --> 00:08:04,714
Further to that, the next five
years or even less is about the, is

131
00:08:04,714 --> 00:08:06,754
not about the quantum dominating.

132
00:08:06,784 --> 00:08:07,384
It's about.

133
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:11,579
Quantum augmentation along with our
classical, it's not a replacement.

134
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:17,249
As I said at the beginning, it is going
to be in conjunction with our classical.

135
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:20,609
The quantum also will be working
and solving the problem much better

136
00:08:20,609 --> 00:08:23,309
than just the classical solving
or just the quantum solving.

137
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:27,979
And with that, we come to a end
and thank you for the opportunity.

138
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,699
Thank you all.
