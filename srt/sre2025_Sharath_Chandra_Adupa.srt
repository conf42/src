00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,320
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:02,040
Good morning.

3
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,880
Welcome to Con 42 study
labeled engineering series.

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,700
My name is Chen Dupa.

5
00:00:08,239 --> 00:00:10,520
I have over 20 years of
experience in IT industry.

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,210
In my career, I worked in financial
sector and in health sector.

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,700
In this session, I wanna talk
about blockchain technology.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,320
Blockchain technology represents
a new revolutionary parum

9
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,290
in digital record keeping.

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,790
Transforming how organizations think
about data integrity and security.

11
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,660
Welcome to my session at its score.

12
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,850
Blockchain functions as a distributed
detail ledger that records transactions

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,560
across a network of computers in a
way that makes it extremely difficult

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,840
to alter or hack existing records.

15
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,630
The significance of blockchain in modern
data security cannot be overstated.

16
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,540
In traditional centralized systems,
data vulnerability stems from single

17
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,170
points of failures and inherent
risks of centralized control.

18
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:01,240
Blockchain technology addresses
these challenges by implementing a

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,530
decentralized approach where data is
distributed across multiple nodes.

20
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,890
The core value proposition of
blockchain includes cryptographic

21
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,050
security, immutability
transparency, and smart contracts.

22
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:21,710
Cryptographic security blockchain utilizes
advanced cryptographic techniques to

23
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:26,420
secure transactions and protect data
integrity, making unauthorized accesses

24
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,929
virtually impossible immutability.

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,179
Once data is recorded on the blockchain,
it becomes impossible to modify

26
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:38,260
without detection, creating an unbroken
sequence of verifiable records.

27
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,540
Transparency.

28
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,120
This technology creates a trustless
environment where participant

29
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,990
can verify the authenticity of
transactions without relying on

30
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,860
intermediaries and smart contracts.

31
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,570
The self-executing contracts with
terms directly written into code,

32
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,920
automate compliance, and reduce the
risk of human error in data handling.

33
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,740
The foundational architecture of
blockchain security leverages distributor

34
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,630
ledger technology called DLT to
fundamentally transform traditional

35
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:15,330
approaches to data integrity and
verification by maintaining synchronized

36
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,670
cryptographically secured copies of the
entire transaction history across numerous

37
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,410
and independent network participants.

38
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,140
Blockchain creates an ecosystem where
no single entity controls the data.

39
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,370
This architectural approach not only
eliminates vulnerable single points

40
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,900
of failure, but also establishes
unprecedented levels of transparency

41
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,020
and auditability while maintaining
robust security guarantees core

42
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,120
security features immutability.

43
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,620
IMMUTABILITY stands as a cornerstone
of blockchain security architecture,

44
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,330
ensuring that once data is committed
to the ledger, it becomes permanently

45
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,580
recorded and resistant to modification.

46
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,090
In enterprise grade blockchain
implementations transactions

47
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,310
achieve immutable status only.

48
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,880
After passing through rigorous
consensus validation typically

49
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,870
required six independent confirmations
in Bitcoin DER protocols.

50
00:03:08,845 --> 00:03:09,805
Decentralization.

51
00:03:10,195 --> 00:03:13,855
Blockchain does not store any of its
information in a central location.

52
00:03:14,575 --> 00:03:18,655
Instead, the blockchain is copied and
spread across a network of computers.

53
00:03:19,255 --> 00:03:23,275
Whenever a new block is added to the
blockchain, every computer on the network

54
00:03:23,305 --> 00:03:27,805
updates its blockchain to reflect the
change By spreading the information

55
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:32,125
across a network, rather than storing
in one central report, central database,

56
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:35,575
blockchain becomes significantly
more difficult to tamper with.

57
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,440
Transparency and anonymity.

58
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,270
Blockchain strikes a unique balance
between transparency and privacy.

59
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,790
While all transactions are visible to the
participants, personal identities remain

60
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,680
hidden through cryptographic addresses.

61
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,740
Example, in Bitcoin users are identified
by their valid addresses, not their

62
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:01,540
real identities, ensuring privacy while
maintaining a transparent transaction.

63
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,900
History cryptographic implementation.

64
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,240
Blockchain uses cryptography to
secure data and verify transactions.

65
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,100
The two key cryptographic methods
are hashing and digital signatures.

66
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,519
Next is security best practices, the
comprehensive risk mitigation through

67
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,930
scheduled third party audits and
formalized incident response frameworks.

68
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,150
Industry applications in
financial services, traditional

69
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,200

70
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,570
Reduction in settlement times from t
plus three to near real time execution.

71
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,690
With operational cost
reducer by 30 to 50%.

72
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,830
Cross-border payments are
foreign exchange rates.

73
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,420
Transaction time is reducer from
three to five days to minutes

74
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,740
through blockchain networks.

75
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:48,605
Improving efficiency and reducing cost.

76
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,995
Smart contract automation, KYC.

77
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:56,585

integrity with 99.99% of accuracy

80
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:10,225
in transaction records and complete
elimination of data duplication issues.

81
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:13,665
Now let's talk about supply
chain management applications.

82
00:05:14,165 --> 00:05:17,645
Now the supply chain management
applications have end-to-end visibility.

83
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:21,905
Product tracking time reduce from
these two seconds, providing real

84
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:26,705
time supply chain transparency,
documentation improvement, documentation

85

00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:52,475
compatibility, regulatory considerations.

119
00:07:53,135 --> 00:07:58,235
Organizations allocate 40 to 50% of
implementation budget, specifically

120
00:07:58,235 --> 00:08:02,135
for compliance and regulatory
adherence and scalability solutions.

121
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:05,915
Current blockchain architectures
limited to processing a hundred to 300.

122
00:08:06,275 --> 00:08:08,795
Transactions per second in
enterprise environments.

123
00:08:09,295 --> 00:08:12,475
Along with this, the organizations
implementing blockchain face

124
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:17,515
critical hurdles, particularly talent
acquisition with 75% of enterprise

125
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:21,745
enterprises struggling to build
teams with blockchain expertise.

126
00:08:22,495 --> 00:08:26,275
The financial investment presence
is sustainable barrier to adoption

127
00:08:26,725 --> 00:08:31,765
as robust enterprise grade solutions
require capital expenditures up to.

128
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,360
500 and thousand to $1 million
for comprehensive deployment.

129
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,620
The complexity of integrating
blockchain with existing business

130
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,390
ecosystems results in implementation
timelines, extending 50 to 60%

131
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,370
beyond initial projections requiring
significant organizational commitment.

132
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:57,090
The other blockchain issues are related
to governance, interoperability, and

133
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,920
technical infrastructure challenges.

134
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,980
Let's begin with governance issues.

135
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:06,380
40% of enterprise blockchain projects
face delays due to governance related

136
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,400
data making processes, creating
significant implementation hurdles.

137
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:15,230
The governance challenges include
complex stakeholder management,

138
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,760
unclear nation authority, and
evolving governance frameworks.

139
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,610
If we talk about interoperability
limitations, only 15% of current

140
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,690
implementations successfully achieve
crossin functionality limiting the

141
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,490
potential for broader ecosystem.

142
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,790
In integration, these limitations are
related to protocol incompatibility,

143
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,050
data format inconsistencies,
and limited standardization.

144
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,710
If we talk about technical
infrastructure challenges.

145
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,510
Organizations report significant
concerns regarding transactions,

146
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,680
finality times with current
implementations averaging three to

147
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,570
five minutes for final settlements.

148
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,850
These are, these issues are related
to network performance issues,

149
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:02,730
security investment requirements,
and scalability constraints, the

150
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,410
future of enterprise blockchain.
