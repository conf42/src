1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,250
So I'd like to start
off with a small story.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,570
The first time I ever saw
a computer was in 1985.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:07,640
I'm joking.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:08,830
I'm so young.

5
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:09,400
Very young.

6
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,240
I'm not at all.

7
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,350
So the first I ever saw a computer
was when I was in high school, and I

8
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,880
think it was one of the most favorite
memory I ever had been around computers.

9
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,590
And this was a time when we
still have, windows XP and

10
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,060
Linux installed on machines.

11
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,720
And I was pretty amazed when I
went to the computer lab and I

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,080
saw those buttons on the computers
blinking and stuff like that.

13
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,500
I actually did not understand, oh no,
what this button meant, but it was

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,760
really exciting to, look at computers
and see my, my, my, my colleagues

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,590
like interact with the computers.

16
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,380
And that was my first
introduction into programming.

17
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,850
Alright, so a little
introduction about myself.

18
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,130
I'm a tech lead currently
working at Ignite Studio.

19
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,660
And of my free time.

20
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,330
I also run the Central African,
Golan community, which is a

21
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,440
community made up of, like-minded
individuals around the, go programming

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,190
language that want to communicate,
share ideas, and, meet together.

23
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,390
And, without further, I do,
let's get into the talk.

24
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,030
This is my early days.

25
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,200
as I've earlier mentioned, in this
presentation, I, the first time I

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,670
actually saw a, an actual pc, was when
I was in high school and I was really

27
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:26,620
drawn and fascinated with this idea
of you could use something that has a

28
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:31,750
small ball under and control something
on the screen that has a cause on it.

29
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,830
And at the time I didn't actually
realize or know that, oh, this is a

30
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:40,420
mouse, this is a screen and that is a
sso and that's how you interact with it.

31
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,290
And at the time, I didn't actually know
what this was and I was really drawn to

32
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,190
that and fascinated by all the lights
that I had on the PC and stuff like that.

33
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,690
It was kinda Star Wars for me.

34
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,540
And, fast forward.

35
00:01:51,865 --> 00:01:58,835
I was, one of three, arts major in a
class full of all science major students

36
00:01:58,865 --> 00:02:03,274
doing computer science in high school,
and that meant that there was a lot

37
00:02:03,274 --> 00:02:04,835
of living up to that I need to do.

38
00:02:05,345 --> 00:02:10,145
And on top of that, we, started learning
how to coordinate TML and in Pascal.

39
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:14,725
And I remember this, one time
when we were in the computer lab.

40
00:02:15,225 --> 00:02:19,185
We had my, our lecturer had this
question and he asked, and I was,

41
00:02:19,445 --> 00:02:24,115
fortunate enough, unfortunate enough
to be picked to answer this question.

42
00:02:24,355 --> 00:02:28,225
And he asked me, what is the
difference between a volatile

43
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,295
and a non volatile memory?

44
00:02:31,135 --> 00:02:31,165
I.

45
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:33,065
And I gave a beautiful
definition for that.

46
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:37,805
But the problem with that was, or
the mistake that I did was I took the

47
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:41,315
definition for Volta and give it to
a non Volta and took definition for

48
00:02:41,315 --> 00:02:43,085
a non Volta and give it to the Volta.

49
00:02:43,475 --> 00:02:47,645
And it was really grueling because
everyone like laughed and the

50
00:02:47,645 --> 00:02:50,825
professor shook his head and
it was really discouraging for

51
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:52,445
me, like for a single mistake.

52
00:02:52,895 --> 00:02:53,555
That I did.

53
00:02:53,945 --> 00:02:58,115
And when the class ended, I felt oh,
maybe I shouldn't take this class.

54
00:02:58,115 --> 00:03:00,995
Maybe I shouldn't just go back to
this class and stuff like that.

55
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:06,485
And on top of that, too, in school, we had
this thing in school where students were

56
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:12,365
not allowed to go into the computer lab
without any supervision for the professor.

57
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:17,555
Meaning that the only opportunity you
get to maybe do some practical work or to

58
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:20,735
learn, relearn, or maybe practice on what.

59
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,620
Your professor thought you a
couple of hours ago or yesterday

60
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:29,000
in class by yourself in the
computer lab was really limited.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,940
So there was limited access
without any supervision.

62
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:38,540
And as growing up without having a
computer or personal PC back at home,

63
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:44,075
it was really difficult to keep up with
the pace of learning, in class and the,

64
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:45,635
catching up to do that you had to do.

65
00:03:46,415 --> 00:03:47,210
And, I also.

66
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:52,825
Also remember, in college, we had
this misconception right in our class

67
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:57,175
that, oh, you cannot, because when I
got to college, we started writing, I

68
00:03:57,175 --> 00:04:02,320
started coding in c. And there was this
misconception that, oh, you cannot use,

69
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:08,190
c as an actual language to get into
or start off your career with, right?

70
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,560
Like it was really rife in the class.

71
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,430
Everyone was saying it.

72
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,570
Everyone was saying it that, oh, you can't
use C to start up your career with this.

73
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,620
C is hard.

74
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,420
C is really low level.

75
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,970
She's meant for mainly people.

76
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,220
Embedded engineers don't let any.

77
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:23,880
Okay.

78
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,950
And under of that, I had to write
most of my C code on a piece of paper.

79
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,220
Still.

80
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,310
I didn't have a personal
laptop at the time, so I had to

81
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,450
write it on a piece of paper.

82
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,410
And anytime that I would just
write it and close my eye and

83
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,640
pray that it works, right?

84
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,940
So it was really like, it added
that, that that steep learning curve,

85
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,770
to, catch up with, with all the.

86
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:52,415
The new concept, the new, philosophy,
the new patterns that I've been taught in

87
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:54,395
class, and to catch up with all of that.

88
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:59,105
So it really increased like the
arts for me into getting a family.

89
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:03,555
And because of that, I became
really I didn't like c like

90
00:05:04,065 --> 00:05:04,935
that was the honest truth.

91
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:08,935
I didn't like to code in c and
transitioning from that, having that

92
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:15,120
mentality, that mindset of, oh, I hate
c. It's for embedded engineers, run away

93
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,160
from it, don't let it, and transitioning
now to go, how would that look like?

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,040
And one of my major challenge that I
always faced when I was writing coding C

95
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:33,239
was to deal with pointers, and it took me
a while to wrap my head around pointers

96
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:38,174
working with Go, but I never actually
understood it when I was working with DNC.

97
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:43,959
and I never understood there was something
as simple as, oh, you have a variable,

98
00:05:43,989 --> 00:05:48,279
you have an address, or the address
points to the value, and that's it.

99
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:52,759
it was really, I thought about it
like black magic in my head when

100
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:57,169
dealing with pointers and see,
but that all became different

101
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:59,239
when I was introduced to pointers.

102
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:00,229
We golan now.

103
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:01,699
Okay, why go?

104
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:05,869
Why did I choose to code in a
language that the semantics look

105
00:06:05,869 --> 00:06:10,369
a little bit like c, that I didn't
really actually like seeing college?

106
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:14,419
Why did I choose this program in
language or how was it different for me?

107
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:19,949
I think one of the main drivers
why I felt comfortable in using

108
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:22,859
Golan was his design philosophy.

109
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:27,249
Golan was designed around
the idea of simplicity.

110
00:06:27,924 --> 00:06:30,714
And I think that was a really
driving factor for me that

111
00:06:30,714 --> 00:06:32,004
I felt comfortable with it.

112
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:39,219
from the ground up when the engineers
and the, the developers in the community

113
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:44,199
thought of creating a new programming
language, was that, okay, let's let make

114
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:49,399
a programming language that will be fast
enough to build, to reduce our build

115
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:54,619
times and let it be simple enough that
people transitioning from other language

116
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:56,029
you might feel comfortable with it.

117
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,649
And I do understand that Go has its own
different way of doing things that maybe

118
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:06,539
people must, especially coming in from the
OOP wall or the object oriented wall might

119
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:12,059
seem, it might seem a little bit weird the
way Go does it, but the main driver for

120
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:14,459
me that I choose Go was, is simplicity.

121
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:20,149
And the second driver where I
chose go was it's, story behind it.

122
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:20,629
This might.

123
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:26,044
Seemed really funny, but it was actually
the story of its creation that really

124
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:31,084
drew my attention because all my years
of, learning other new programming

125
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:36,394
language, I haven't actually taken the
time to look into why a programming

126
00:07:36,394 --> 00:07:41,164
language was created and reasonably I it's
creation of what he was trying to solve.

127
00:07:41,784 --> 00:07:44,544
I'll try to tell this story to
the best of my understanding

128
00:07:44,574 --> 00:07:46,414
and feel free to, check me too.

129
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:53,799
So the story goes as, we had these
engineers in Google at the time, and so it

130
00:07:53,799 --> 00:08:01,099
was a rock bike, grease Man and Thompson,
and they were having this problem

131
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:05,609
when, because at the time their, their
programs took a lot of time to build.

132
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,484
And which was a problem for them.

133
00:08:08,574 --> 00:08:12,234
For them, because imagine writing
the program is c plus and it takes, I

134
00:08:12,234 --> 00:08:16,704
don't know, upwards of some couple of
minutes to compare and stuff like that.

135
00:08:17,214 --> 00:08:19,434
So it was an issue for them at the time.

136
00:08:19,434 --> 00:08:27,074
I. And they decided to solve this
problem by building a, new programming

137
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:33,944
language that will be centered around
simplicity, easy to understand.

138
00:08:33,944 --> 00:08:36,259
And the third, which is
really important, fast.

139
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:41,189
they come up with this idea of goal,
which, as I've been reading online,

140
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:47,559
some people say, oh, it was meant as a
replacement, of sea, but I do not think

141
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,479
it was actually a replacement of sea.

142
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:53,869
other people say, oh, it is a super
set of sea because the semantics look

143
00:08:53,869 --> 00:08:59,599
a little bit like sea and it draws most
of its, design, philosophy from sea.

144
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:02,509
But it is totally
different in its own right.

145
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:03,859
So that is totally different.

146
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:08,219
And I really I was really, I really
liked the story and I was drawn to

147
00:09:08,219 --> 00:09:14,529
the idea, of behind its creation and
when it was launched in I think 2011.

148
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:16,659
Was it 2009?

149
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,029
it those two years.

150
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:23,769
But, I really enjoyed disturb inspiration
and how these guys, thought about the

151
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:27,159
problem that they had and a programming
language that could solve the problem.

152
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:33,369
And Rock Pi gave a talk back in 2015
about what we did right and what we did

153
00:09:33,369 --> 00:09:37,999
wrong, and I think he really, touched
on some really important points too.

154
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:42,179
On why the, or the things they
did right begin setting off it

155
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:43,394
go and the things they did wrong.

156
00:09:44,324 --> 00:09:50,414
And I think those are some of the things
that draw me to go or why I choose Go.

157
00:09:51,074 --> 00:09:57,464
And the third thing that I also like
to pile on is, go, also comes in

158
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:03,904
like a full fledged package, which I
find really easy for me as a kind of

159
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:08,849
a, you when I was starting off Co.
So it comes with the format as it

160
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:10,589
comes to all the testing libraries.

161
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:12,839
It comes even with an HCTP.

162
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:16,499
Tools library that you can use
to spin up your local server.

163
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:20,769
So there's no need to install
any additional, packages to use.

164
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:22,809
There's no need to configure anything.

165
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:24,609
You just install, go.

166
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:27,249
And from there you have
your link test already.

167
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:31,409
A big thing, you have your,
test, is already baked in.

168
00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:34,984
You have your, your HCTP
package already baked into that.

169
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:37,924
You can spin up the local
server for web development.

170
00:10:38,359 --> 00:10:42,619
I think all these things
coming together really made it,

171
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:44,659
appealing for me to choose goal.

172
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:52,069
So my idea of programming at the time
that, you couldn't use, seed to start

173
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:58,469
off a career and discovering goal,
that looked similar to what I hated

174
00:10:58,469 --> 00:11:02,339
in college to learn, really changed
my perspective about these things.

175
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:07,739
And offered me an opportunity to
dive into this language and really

176
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:11,759
see how it works and becoming
was especially becoming really

177
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,279
comfortable with it, moving forward.

178
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:21,319
So what actually happened, with, or
how it go actually changed my life.

179
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:25,999
I would rather like to say
more, or rather like to say it

180
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:28,579
actually changed my perspective.

181
00:11:29,464 --> 00:11:34,264
how do you, as someone that all your
life, through college, you have always

182
00:11:34,324 --> 00:11:40,384
understood that, there are certain, there
are only few and certain language that

183
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:42,719
you can use to start of a career with.

184
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:49,274
And your first job that you ever
had, give you an opportunity or you

185
00:11:49,274 --> 00:11:55,094
were being required to code in a
language that look like a language IE

186
00:11:55,454 --> 00:11:57,464
that is c that you hated in college.

187
00:11:57,914 --> 00:12:02,834
So how do you, I guess walk around
that or become comfortable with that?

188
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:08,074
I guess you could, I could
look at the goal as either.

189
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:14,049
It helped me to hear from my past wounds,
misconceptions that I had about C because

190
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:19,369
I always had this idea that C is really
difficult, I know and can, actually learn

191
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:25,379
and understand it, and the people that
actually understand it, I dunno, genies.

192
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:30,729
it really, helped me to hear from
that misconception that I had.

193
00:12:31,434 --> 00:12:37,434
and my first project that I actually
worked on was using coal as a software,

194
00:12:37,434 --> 00:12:43,374
as a, junior developer, which was
to, build an online ticketing system.

195
00:12:44,034 --> 00:12:49,104
And I had only a week
to familiarize myself.

196
00:12:49,104 --> 00:12:53,724
We call before standard of the
project next week to, so it.

197
00:12:54,204 --> 00:12:54,684
Even.

198
00:12:54,744 --> 00:13:01,674
Even no, even though the learning
curve was really steep, but I think

199
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:07,224
coming from the angle or coming from
the viewpoint of understanding, oh,

200
00:13:07,224 --> 00:13:09,054
okay, what is sprung your language?

201
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,164
Trying, do you understand?

202
00:13:10,464 --> 00:13:11,574
How does it look like?

203
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:16,524
What are the features, the things that it
brings to the table, and why are we using

204
00:13:16,524 --> 00:13:22,364
it to, does it actually solve our business
case or the problem that we are having?

205
00:13:22,364 --> 00:13:25,404
I. that we want to solve in
this particular business case.

206
00:13:25,914 --> 00:13:28,224
So it really shaped my perspective.

207
00:13:28,854 --> 00:13:35,524
and also, I worked with it for, over
here and within that I also got an

208
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:42,004
opportunity to become a tech lead,
working with it, which I think, maybe

209
00:13:42,334 --> 00:13:47,224
it wouldn't have, happened if I was,
Using other programming language to code,

210
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:48,844
or maybe I'm just lucky, I don't know.

211
00:13:49,534 --> 00:13:53,164
But I think it really
changed me in that way.

212
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:58,624
So my perspective and in my career
and, also offered an opportunity

213
00:13:58,624 --> 00:14:03,224
to meet some really amazing people,
out there in the Go Community.

214
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:09,804
shout out to my Boyer from the, to the,
from the Go Insiders community and also.

215
00:14:10,374 --> 00:14:12,264
The, go Luck community too.

216
00:14:12,414 --> 00:14:16,314
Really amazing people that offered
guidance and people that are willing

217
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:20,214
to take out your free time to answer
your question and send you a message

218
00:14:20,244 --> 00:14:24,904
to reply to, some, message or questions
that you might have, which I think

219
00:14:24,904 --> 00:14:26,764
was pretty cool and amazing too.

220
00:14:27,264 --> 00:14:28,554
what does future look like?

221
00:14:28,604 --> 00:14:30,304
for me working with, go.

222
00:14:31,054 --> 00:14:38,614
I think it will be more of, having these
kinds of, presentation and, sensitizing,

223
00:14:38,734 --> 00:14:41,794
more developers in my local community.

224
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:48,514
because I did a, a little observation
and in my local community there

225
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:54,164
are not a lot of, co-developers, or
people that are even familiar with it.

226
00:14:54,914 --> 00:15:00,674
So I think for me, the future with, with
working with gold be more of, sensitizing

227
00:15:00,704 --> 00:15:05,264
and having this kind of presentations,
workshop, meetings, meetups.

228
00:15:05,774 --> 00:15:11,054
And that is the primary reason why I
decided to start running the central

229
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:14,799
office community, to, put the word
out there, another way of saying

230
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:23,159
it, and to, help others to, and, If
people that, had the same experience

231
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:27,649
like me and trying to, I'll probably
still go online and say, what kind of

232
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:31,999
programming, language disease, and maybe
came from the same background as me.

233
00:15:32,619 --> 00:15:38,449
I think, doing more of this kinds of
presentation might more hold their

234
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:43,389
hand and pull them up, I think that's,
that's how it looks like when, when I

235
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:45,249
envision the future working with Go.

236
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:50,459
what are the key takeaway, from this
talk, that I think might be useful,

237
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:57,089
for, early startups, for, people that
are undecided here, for people that

238
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,129
are just stuck in the career limbo.

239
00:15:59,179 --> 00:15:59,899
stuff like that.

240
00:16:00,664 --> 00:16:05,874
And, I think perseverance and
resourcefulness, although it sounds

241
00:16:06,374 --> 00:16:13,294
a little bit cliche, but, I think the
idea of consistency, in, just starting

242
00:16:13,294 --> 00:16:17,854
off with the programming language and
building a lots and lots of projects too.

243
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:22,284
And, having, people around
here to poverty you up and.

244
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:29,109
I would recommend the Go Line
inside a community on X and the,

245
00:16:29,169 --> 00:16:31,959
official go Slack community too.

246
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:37,959
which I think are really valuable
resources to help people that are

247
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:44,199
looking to study now for even people
that have been in the industry or

248
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:45,939
in the Go ecosystem for a while too.

249
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:51,579
So I hope this, this talk,
offers some value to you.

250
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:57,529
And, thank you very much to, for listening
and enjoy the rest of the conference.
