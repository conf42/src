1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,730
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:04,430
My name is Achin Var.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,140
I'm a senior software engineer
passionate about building secure

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,450
and scalable distributed system.

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:17,560
It's truly an honor to be here at Con 42
and sharing my insight into how we can

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,320
architect and secure healthcare system
that go far beyond regulatory compliances.

7
00:00:24,205 --> 00:00:28,105
Today, I will walk you through
guidelines and best practices that can

8
00:00:28,105 --> 00:00:33,595
help design a system which not only
secure sensitive patient data, but

9
00:00:33,595 --> 00:00:38,715
also significantly improve operational
resilience, efficiency, and patient trust.

10
00:00:39,495 --> 00:00:45,445
So the topic name is how to Architect or
Architecting Secure Distributed Healthcare

11
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:48,035
System which focuses on providing a.

12
00:00:48,845 --> 00:00:53,325
Blueprint for building systems that
not only meet regulatory requirements

13
00:00:53,325 --> 00:00:59,195
like hipaa, but also enhances realtime
security operational availability and

14
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,969
patient satisfaction while securing
or preparing for the future stability.

15
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:09,320
This is a slide which, sets the
foundation for what modern secular

16
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,789
healthcare system should aim to achieve.

17
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:15,649
It is about more than about
just protecting patient data.

18
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:20,759
It is about ensuring systems that
should be responsive, proactive, and

19
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,094
resilient in order to maintain the
highest standard for the patient care.

20
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,699
So in that, the first point I want to
highlight is advanced security framework.

21
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:33,729
So it is recommended to establish
an advanced security framework

22
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:40,799
that can reduce unauthorized access
incidents up to around 90 point 99.89%

23
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:45,089
multilayered, and the system should
have multi-layered authentication

24
00:01:45,089 --> 00:01:49,059
protocols should be employed to
validate access request thoroughly.

25
00:01:49,699 --> 00:01:54,059
So all these numbers I'm going to
talk are are retrieved from the

26
00:01:54,059 --> 00:01:58,669
papers, which are already published my
studies and existing implementation.

27
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:03,079
The second point I have here is
that critical data accessibility.

28
00:02:03,529 --> 00:02:08,689
So in emergency healthcare scenarios
designing the system to enable sub two

29
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:11,449
seconds data travel can be lifesaving.

30
00:02:12,144 --> 00:02:15,534
Critical patient data must
be made instantly available

31
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,964
while preserving its integrity.

32
00:02:19,164 --> 00:02:22,554
The third point I want to highlight
is protect proactive threat

33
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:26,694
analysis, which is very important
while designing subsystem.

34
00:02:27,204 --> 00:02:31,284
In the current age, we can incorporate,
AI, air powered monitoring system

35
00:02:31,374 --> 00:02:37,494
that can significantly enhance anomaly
detection by approximately 94.7%.

36
00:02:38,244 --> 00:02:43,234
And proactive analysis of such system
helps identify potential threats before

37
00:02:43,234 --> 00:02:48,609
they escalate or into actual breaches,
which are very important to take care of.

38
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:55,374
And the fourth point on is, accelerated
incident resolution, the systems

39
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:59,704
should have a setup, which, should
be able to handle the incident

40
00:02:59,754 --> 00:03:03,274
resolutions as, as quick as possible.

41
00:03:03,404 --> 00:03:04,454
It is impossible.

42
00:03:04,604 --> 00:03:09,034
It is important to architect security
posture that should aim to reduce

43
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,704
incident detection and response time.

44
00:03:11,784 --> 00:03:16,224
From lengthy periods like 1 67
minutes which is this number is taken

45
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:21,604
from the existing research paper
and to down, as in as 12.3 minutes.

46
00:03:21,874 --> 00:03:24,124
Ensuring threats are neutralized quickly.

47
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,360
Going down to the next slide.

48
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:33,029
System architecture, how we should
aim to design these systems.

49
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:38,429
So this slide discusses the critical
architecture component needed for

50
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:43,920
secure, scalable healthcare system by
layering distributed data management,

51
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:48,859
microservices advanced security
and efficient user interfaces.

52
00:03:49,654 --> 00:03:53,505
So first point there is on
how we should design a data

53
00:03:53,505 --> 00:03:54,985
layer in the distributed world.

54
00:03:55,695 --> 00:03:59,995
We should architect the data layer to
orchestrate the encrypted patient data,

55
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:06,185
potentially managing volumes at large
as in exa heights with validation rates

56
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:12,960
of 99.997% to ensure the accuracy and
protection for both system and patient.

57
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,850
The second is how the microservice
system or the core of it should be.

58
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:24,210
It is advisable to build microservice
based core, capital of handling

59
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:29,580
millions of concurrent API requests
and targeting numbers like, in millions

60
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:34,470
while ensuring zero downtime through
the inclusion failure mechanism.

61
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,355
And the third is how we should,
the system should design its

62
00:04:39,355 --> 00:04:41,525
security middleware integrate.

63
00:04:41,555 --> 00:04:45,375
We should the system should integrate
real time behavioral in the middleware

64
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:51,125
to neutralize, the 99% of potential
threats and before they penetrate

65
00:04:51,215 --> 00:04:53,705
deeper into the healthcare systems.

66
00:04:54,455 --> 00:04:58,475
And the third, or of the four
point on architecture is that user

67
00:04:58,475 --> 00:05:03,815
interface layer, which is very
important to have a system resilient.

68
00:05:04,145 --> 00:05:10,005
So the system should design the user
interface to compliance while delivering

69
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:15,025
the sub two seconds response time,
especially for healthcare operations.

70
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,455
Going on to the next slides sorry.

71
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:25,915
So these slides explains about
how the high availability and

72
00:05:25,915 --> 00:05:29,845
safe swift accessibility are
non-negotiable in healthcare system.

73
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,195
As explained before, it's.

74
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,150
The patient life is on stake.

75
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,210
So it is very important to
have these systems in place.

76
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:43,580
So this slide defines how ambiguous
but achievable targets to ensure

77
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,950
the system reliability under stress.

78
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,205
So first point is about
system up up times.

79
00:05:50,895 --> 00:05:51,585
The system.

80
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:55,875
We should design the system architecture
to achieve finance availability,

81
00:05:56,145 --> 00:06:01,095
ensuring uninterrupted access to
healthcare service around the clock.

82
00:06:02,325 --> 00:06:05,475
And the second on this is
that data accessibility.

83
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:10,495
The systems should ensure that,
accessibility target is, again, close to

84
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:16,035
five nines, but enabling the clinicians
and healthcare staff to re try information

85
00:06:16,035 --> 00:06:18,495
quickly, reliably, whenever needed.

86
00:06:18,555 --> 00:06:19,575
Or 24 7.

87
00:06:20,565 --> 00:06:26,235
And more on the third point on EP,
I request this as explained in the

88
00:06:26,235 --> 00:06:30,460
system architecture, we should have
infrastructure which is optimized

89
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,790
to handle, millions of API requests
while maintaining sub to second

90
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:39,970
response times, which is, important
to guarantee operational efficiency.

91
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,340
Moving on to next slide.

92
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,630
While designing this system, how
we can have a audit mechanism.

93
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,070
So this slide maintains,
explains about auditing system.

94
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,120
Such healthcare system should be,
should have some sort of audit

95
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,650
trails to meet the compliance
standard and ensure traceability.

96
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:06,100
So it outlines how there are multiple
ways, but this slide explains how

97
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,380
blockchain inspired methods can adapt.

98
00:07:08,755 --> 00:07:10,615
To achieve the tamper for auditing.

99
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:15,410
So the first point on auditing
is that event recording.

100
00:07:16,725 --> 00:07:21,095
So a system should secure every
interaction with the system.

101
00:07:21,455 --> 00:07:25,645
And within the crypto Go Seal
transaction blocks so that it's not

102
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:30,925
leaked or it's not accessible to
to people who doesn't have access.

103
00:07:31,315 --> 00:07:35,095
And this is to prevent any trampling
or unauthorized alteration.

104
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,720
A chain validation.

105
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,690
So the system should imply distributed
consensus mechanism capital of post

106
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,580
processing around millions of events
to validate authentic authenticity

107
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:52,400
of every transaction, which is again,
very important to have this in place.

108
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,740
And along with that, the third point we
should consider that anomaly detection.

109
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,810
The system should build a mechanism
that identifies and isolate unauthorized

110
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,730
modification within milliseconds.

111
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,400
And this is to safeguard the
system integrity proactively.

112
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:17,460
And the fourth point is that like about,
history of imp impactability, so the,

113
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,050
we should preserve a tamper proof.

114
00:08:19,815 --> 00:08:24,525
Chronological audit trail that not only
supports the regulatory compliance,

115
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:29,925
but also strength strengthens the trust
in system data handling and practices.

116
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:36,785
So all these four points are very high
level points and very but very important

117
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:39,575
to have our audit system in place.

118
00:08:40,115 --> 00:08:42,035
Going on to our next slide.

119
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,160
As threat evolves so
much healthcare system.

120
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,560
And what does this mean?

121
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,630
Is that the mechanism which were
there in place 10 years ago or 20

122
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,340
years ago are not relevant now.

123
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,210
So we should evolve with how
the threats are evolving.

124
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,770
So this slides highlights how
productive security models using

125
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,570
AI and machine learning can detect.

126
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:12,050
Neutralize threats before they can
damage in the healthcare system.

127
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:18,820
So the first is that processing
power which is in current AI

128
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,680
world, which is very important.

129
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:26,240
So it is essential to architect system
capital of analyzing millions of

130
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,740
security events per second, utilizing
custom design, machine learning

131
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,500
acceleration hardware enables.

132
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,050
Rapid intelligent decision making systems.

133
00:09:36,905 --> 00:09:41,280
Which are, one of the key to have
a predictive security models.

134
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,270
And the second on this is that
which is extension of smart

135
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,800
models, is that edge computing.

136
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,590
So we should leverage a strategic
edge computing nodes distributed

137
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,780
across all healthcare facilities.

138
00:09:55,485 --> 00:10:00,770
And this should be real time processing,
closer to, source and that will help

139
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,760
it make sure that we are drastically
shorten the detection times and

140
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,660
response actions and while doing those.

141
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,980
So it is very important to have
accuracy metric, which makes sure

142
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,840
that the detections are moderated,
rightly the system should have models

143
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,880
if we are designing that way, which
should target close to 99% of threat

144
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:27,020
detection, accuracy which in this
high stake healthcare environment.

145
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:33,910
And while doing that we should, reduce the
false rate to a remarkable, close to none

146
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:40,550
or maybe 0.03% which is which outperform
the other industry average of 2.3%.

147
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,560
And the fourth point is very important
on the slide is early detection.

148
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,535
So build the system that can
identify potential breaches

149
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,930
which is based on the history.

150
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,485
We should and also this goes
hand in hand with audit trail.

151
00:10:56,825 --> 00:11:02,775
Within a minutes and we should deploy
sophisticated counter measures within 200

152
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:04,935
milliseconds to neutralize the threat.

153
00:11:06,455 --> 00:11:08,495
Going on to the next slide.

154
00:11:08,595 --> 00:11:14,445
So when we do or analyze or
implement a system, it is very

155
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:19,205
important to analyze how this
will impact the patient confident.

156
00:11:20,135 --> 00:11:25,735
So security investment aren't just
technical or just to satisfy the

157
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:29,815
compliance that directly impact
the patient trust and confidence.

158
00:11:30,055 --> 00:11:34,455
So this slide basically highlights
how security secure architecture

159
00:11:34,545 --> 00:11:38,375
influence the patient's satisfaction
and their privacy prescription.

160
00:11:39,275 --> 00:11:40,535
First on data trust.

161
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:44,615
So healthcare providers should aim
to, have patient trust and privacy

162
00:11:44,615 --> 00:11:49,935
satisfaction a significant uplift or
demonstrate a tangible proof of impact.

163
00:11:49,935 --> 00:11:55,835
So this the first point is here we can
see that the before implementation and

164
00:11:55,835 --> 00:12:03,585
after implementation the data trust and
the second bar here, it also explains how.

165
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:09,885
With this system implementation a
privacy satisfaction has been increased.

166
00:12:09,915 --> 00:12:14,185
Which is again, very important in
while architecting such system.

167
00:12:14,665 --> 00:12:20,050
And on the same line a security
confidence comes into picture.

168
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:25,140
And it based on the studies it's
it has been found out that if we

169
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,965
have all the systems in place,
as explained briefly about.

170
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:33,565
The security confidence
also gets increases.

171
00:12:35,515 --> 00:12:37,495
Going on to the next slide,

172
00:12:40,105 --> 00:12:45,205
we discussed a lot of points and how to
architect design what things to consider,

173
00:12:45,205 --> 00:12:49,885
what we how we should incorporate AI
models, but ultimately it is also very

174
00:12:49,885 --> 00:12:54,585
important to, consider the financial
impact of such technical implementation.

175
00:12:54,915 --> 00:12:58,815
Implementing strong security not
only protects the patient, but also

176
00:12:58,815 --> 00:13:00,765
delivers clear financial returns.

177
00:13:00,915 --> 00:13:05,745
So this slide explains how security
investment translate into saving

178
00:13:05,745 --> 00:13:07,605
efficiency and risk mitigation.

179
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:12,525
So the first point on that is that
annual cost evidence avoidance.

180
00:13:12,915 --> 00:13:17,055
By preventing breaches and regulatory
penalties, healthcare organization can

181
00:13:17,055 --> 00:13:22,015
save approximately 3.2 million annually
through proactive security frameworks.

182
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:28,990
So this number is again it could be on
north of a hundred million or, 1 million,

183
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:34,370
but ultimately it, it boost ups or avoids
the annual cost and boosts up the revenue.

184
00:13:35,645 --> 00:13:37,375
And compliance efficiency.

185
00:13:37,855 --> 00:13:42,285
So automating regulatory reporting and
enhancing security controls can lead

186
00:13:42,285 --> 00:13:47,975
to, 97.8 reduction, percent reduction
in reportable compliance incidents, and

187
00:13:47,975 --> 00:13:53,075
it reduces the audit and penetration
of preparation of workloads by 86%.

188
00:13:55,115 --> 00:13:57,085
And the third is operational saving.

189
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:02,485
Through AI pod workflow automation
organization can boost the efficiency

190
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:08,530
of their security operations team
by, more than 50%, but resources,

191
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:14,400
if we have the systems in place,
discuss about the 70% 74%, security

192
00:14:14,405 --> 00:14:16,915
operat operations can be, lifted up.

193
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:17,725
Yeah.

194
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:25,525
So to, or to summarize on operational
saving from a couple of hours, two minutes

195
00:14:26,035 --> 00:14:28,735
that is the goal of the systems would be

196
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:35,575
going on to the next slide
implementation strategy.

197
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:42,235
Successfully deployment of secure system
requires a strategic phased approach.

198
00:14:42,335 --> 00:14:44,375
It has to be very well thought out.

199
00:14:44,755 --> 00:14:47,925
So this slides provides a
blueprint to follow when when

200
00:14:47,925 --> 00:14:51,705
implementing Secure Healthcare
System and how we can architect it.

201
00:14:52,285 --> 00:14:53,995
First, infrastructure assessment.

202
00:14:54,055 --> 00:14:58,165
So we should start with a
comp comprehensive evaluation

203
00:14:58,165 --> 00:14:59,425
of existing systems.

204
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:05,160
To uncover criticalities and operational
gaps, we should look at how, what

205
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:11,680
is the current rate of API request
we get and that will and how if

206
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,360
the load varies based on the season
system or season or any particular

207
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,080
part of the or month of the year.

208
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:23,070
So that all will help in infrastructure
assessment and designing.

209
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,840
Or choosing an infrastructure
and architectural blueprint.

210
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,380
So we should the system should develop a
customized security implementation plant

211
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:39,080
tailored to each healthcare facilities
or, systems unique environment, ensuring,

212
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,100
scalability if in case there is a need of,

213
00:15:45,115 --> 00:15:45,840
and the.

214
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,060
Third is phase deployment.

215
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:52,630
So implementing security
components strategically in phases.

216
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:57,945
It ensures zero disruption and to
essentially the patient care services.

217
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,250
And also the phase deployment.

218
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,640
Make sure that along with the audit
trail, we find out the weakness

219
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,590
and strongness of our system.

220
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,970
So the pha, our deployment
in different layers.

221
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,690
We can analyze system pretty early and
fix it and continuous optimization.

222
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,780
Designing system that dynamically
evolve by integrating real time threat

223
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,760
intelligence and adaptive learnings.

224
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:29,380
It's basically ensures that defenses
that are, stay ahead of emerging

225
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,570
threats, which is very important.

226
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,790
Going on to next start a slide,
future selling capabilities.

227
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:43,500
As I mentioned the healthcare system
must be prepared for future, must be

228
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,840
prepared prepared for future scalability.

229
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:52,290
So this slide describes how to architect
or design a system that can withstand

230
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:57,540
tomorrow's challenges, scalability
issues including evolution quantum

231
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,740
computing threads, and massive data
growth, which is very much possible.

232
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,720
So advance.

233
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,150
First point on that is
I advance integration.

234
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:12,540
So architect security system that itself
evolve without human intervention.

235
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:18,420
Intervention by integrating AI models
is a gold standard, and that way

236
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:23,640
we can make sure that we are, going
hand in hand or one step ahead even

237
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,110
before the threats are generated.

238
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:31,755
The second is that point is that quantum
resistant encryption, so future proof

239
00:17:31,755 --> 00:17:36,845
security by adopting cryptographic
protocols designed to withstand

240
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:41,585
attacks from quantum computing and
ensuring long term resilience issues.

241
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,985
And the third is that
expanded data capacity.

242
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:50,505
So as explained about during our
infrastructure slide we should

243
00:17:50,505 --> 00:17:55,425
plan to infra have, infrastructure,
capital of managing petabyte of data.

244
00:17:55,695 --> 00:18:01,935
So this number 45, 45 0.7 petabytes
is the number got from the recent.

245
00:18:01,935 --> 00:18:08,055
He one of the biggest healthcare system
that receives that much data and yeah.

246
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:13,260
So going on to the next slide which
is a key takeaways to conclude these

247
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:18,710
slides, enforce reinforces the holistic
approach that is needed to architect

248
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:23,330
secure a scalable healthcare system
that are not only compliant, but truly

249
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,420
resilient intelligent and future ready.

250
00:18:26,935 --> 00:18:30,925
The first point is that security
beyond compliance, so build security

251
00:18:30,925 --> 00:18:35,455
architecture that exceeds minimum
regulatory requirements while

252
00:18:35,485 --> 00:18:37,645
driving operational efficiencies.

253
00:18:38,275 --> 00:18:40,335
The second is predictive protection.

254
00:18:40,365 --> 00:18:44,525
There are multiple ways, but with
today's ai driven world we can

255
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:49,325
include or adopt AI driven security
models that proactively detects

256
00:18:49,325 --> 00:18:55,275
the threats and ensuring protection
well before system would react And.

257
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,855
Th third point is that proven results.

258
00:18:57,855 --> 00:19:03,165
So we should focus on achieving measurable
outcomes such as into finance, or close

259
00:19:03,165 --> 00:19:06,985
to finance and future ready architecture.

260
00:19:06,985 --> 00:19:11,875
So design system that accommo accommodates
considers growing data demands

261
00:19:11,945 --> 00:19:17,265
evolving threats and new technology
all the way through 2027 and beyond.

262
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:18,735
Thank you.
