1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,620
Hello.

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:05,660
Welcome to this talk about how a large
language model took me on vacation.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,480
My name is Erik Lijsma and I'm a senior
front end engineer at Soap Rasteria.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,340
Today, I'm going to
take you on this story.

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,729
This is a story of my own, all of some
core insights I had working with AI.

6
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:22,099
Yeah, we're going to see what I've
learned from this interaction,

7
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:24,549
how it improved, my AI usage.

8
00:00:25,049 --> 00:00:29,589
So it all started over a year ago,
when I started to use, JetGPT to plan

9
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:31,859
a holiday, a holiday trip for me.

10
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:35,679
it was not much travel
experience I had at that moment.

11
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:41,979
So I started to collaborate with
Chachipiti and tell me about some options.

12
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:45,999
And in the end, we went
to Porto in Portugal.

13
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:51,679
I always see this trip as the
start of my personal life with AI.

14
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:53,399
It has some impact there.

15
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:56,399
I had one of the best
holidays I've had so far.

16
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:01,289
And like I said, it was very nice because
we didn't have much travel experience.

17
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,424
And this Chachipiti collaboration really
took a lot out of my hands figuring

18
00:01:06,424 --> 00:01:09,564
stuff out and giving us a carefree trip.

19
00:01:10,064 --> 00:01:14,204
And I started to realize that AI
can really make a big impact on

20
00:01:14,204 --> 00:01:15,844
the non digital world as well.

21
00:01:16,144 --> 00:01:19,324
And not only for me, but
for every person's life as

22
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:20,794
well, if they want it or not.

23
00:01:21,294 --> 00:01:26,314
During this trip planning, I found
out some, steps and realizations,

24
00:01:26,574 --> 00:01:28,014
which I'm going to share with you.

25
00:01:28,514 --> 00:01:31,244
So the first thing is about
understanding the technique.

26
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:35,534
while planning this holiday, this
trip, you start to notice that on

27
00:01:35,534 --> 00:01:37,114
the trip, things work differently.

28
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:41,974
First of all, we were going to a country
with a different language, but also how

29
00:01:41,974 --> 00:01:47,744
you approach getting your dinner, go over
your activities or your daily schedule.

30
00:01:48,384 --> 00:01:50,344
These things work different
than they work at home.

31
00:01:51,324 --> 00:01:55,354
they can be so fundamentally different
that you have to adapt to that.

32
00:01:55,394 --> 00:01:58,734
If you do the things how you do them
at home, it's not going to work.

33
00:01:59,154 --> 00:02:02,494
this is one of the understanding
parts for me that AI you should

34
00:02:02,554 --> 00:02:05,334
also use, how it was meant to be.

35
00:02:05,344 --> 00:02:08,334
How does an actual large
language model work?

36
00:02:09,244 --> 00:02:13,044
And for me to understand how a large
language model worked really did a

37
00:02:13,044 --> 00:02:16,154
big benefit on my, quality of output.

38
00:02:16,654 --> 00:02:19,964
and we have already so many
times, but it's a language model.

39
00:02:20,594 --> 00:02:23,724
And I don't think we
can emphasize it enough.

40
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:29,134
It's even in a name, a large language
model, but we are so easily deceived

41
00:02:29,164 --> 00:02:35,224
by the power that AI has, that our
conscious filters, are easily bypassed.

42
00:02:36,024 --> 00:02:37,014
First in the beginning.

43
00:02:37,014 --> 00:02:40,474
And we probably all know and
remember this, the situation.

44
00:02:40,474 --> 00:02:40,544
And.

45
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:45,699
We started to be very polite
to our interactions with AI

46
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,309
and with large language models.

47
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:52,339
Mainly because somewhere in the
back of our minds, we thought they

48
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,909
might gotta take over the world.

49
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:55,249
I rather be nice to them.

50
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:56,319
So hopefully they.

51
00:02:56,624 --> 00:02:57,674
Be nice to me as well.

52
00:02:57,674 --> 00:03:01,124
Then the other way around where
we would be direct and not as

53
00:03:01,124 --> 00:03:02,799
nice, but getting good results.

54
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:09,929
But AI is still a language model
and context can change, but we

55
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:11,249
are easily deceived by that.

56
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:19,079
we often got the feeling that I, that
large language models have a more, have

57
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,229
more understanding, more knowledge,
but it has no absolute knowledge.

58
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:24,209
As an example where.

59
00:03:24,684 --> 00:03:30,054
When we ask an, a JGPT who is the son
of Marilee Pfeiffer, it's going to

60
00:03:30,054 --> 00:03:32,794
give us a pretty convincing answer.

61
00:03:33,684 --> 00:03:34,814
Only it's not true.

62
00:03:35,164 --> 00:03:37,054
Knowledge wise, this isn't correct.

63
00:03:37,064 --> 00:03:38,604
It's no, it's not a fact.

64
00:03:38,984 --> 00:03:43,395
It's the other way around, where,
Daniel Baldwin, this is him, is

65
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:45,065
not the son of Marilee Pfeiffer.

66
00:03:45,565 --> 00:03:49,795
And by changing the context, because,
Marilee Pfeiffer is not that famous,

67
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:54,265
but her son is, and when we ask her
who is the mother of Tom Cruise, which

68
00:03:54,265 --> 00:03:59,815
is the actual son of Marilee Pfeiffer,
it's telling us the right answer.

69
00:04:00,315 --> 00:04:06,005
So this change in context already,
determined the knowledge it like the

70
00:04:06,235 --> 00:04:08,785
AI has and how easily we are deceived.

71
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,715
We had the same with image and with image.

72
00:04:10,715 --> 00:04:12,825
We have a natural filter.

73
00:04:13,155 --> 00:04:16,589
When we see something,
we are eased more easily.

74
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,560
I'm noticing things are off.

75
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:25,110
So with images, it started to
use, very, weird and non logical

76
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,350
ways of showing fingers and hands.

77
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,470
And that's not nice.

78
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,740
So we started trading on those,
on those, things to make it look

79
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,829
wet better and have a nicer.

80
00:04:34,345 --> 00:04:36,035
representation of a hands.

81
00:04:36,585 --> 00:04:39,925
and we got better at it or the AI got
better in it and it got to understand it.

82
00:04:40,495 --> 00:04:44,694
But in the meanwhile, for example,
roller coasters don't nearly get as

83
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:47,525
much, attention as hands and fingers, do.

84
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:53,435
So you see these images look very
natural, like very realistic.

85
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,400
only to see that they are not real
or possible or, based in reality.

86
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,079
And we see that and we feel that more
naturally that this is not reality.

87
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:10,340
And with text and it's harder
to get that context to see how

88
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,130
true to, to, to reality, this is.

89
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,680
And it's a particular
problem for text models.

90
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,720
And that's different than image,
video, or sound, sound models,

91
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,500
because this text is not natural.

92
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,799
image and the other things,
we naturally perceive them.

93
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,429
But text is something we had to learn.

94
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,950
and this is why this is
so big of a difference.

95
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:35,370
So in my preparation, I asked AI
to help me prepare a packing list.

96
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,750
here I got a reply that
had some formatting in it.

97
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:44,420
And this is one, learning for me that
understanding, to use formatting to,

98
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:50,010
give context or emphasize certain parts
of an text are, is really helpful.

99
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,330
It gives the model some structure to work
with and understand what's being asked.

100
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,100
And we can use this building blocks,
to give context to formatting.

101
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,820
Let me show you a couple of them.

102
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,080
to distinguish certain sections
of your prompt, we can use

103
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,740
different formatting tools.

104
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,340
For example, backticks to
highlight snippets of code,

105
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:19,720
triple quotes to distinguish
certain parts from other parts.

106
00:06:20,645 --> 00:06:25,880
this is, an attachment or like the text,
I'm talking about a line separator to,

107
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:30,595
to distinguishing sections between your
prompt and heading with a column to show.

108
00:06:30,685 --> 00:06:35,415
the next thing has some, is
related to this heading and list.

109
00:06:35,505 --> 00:06:37,185
If there are unor or ordered.

110
00:06:37,515 --> 00:06:40,420
They also give some
context to, to a section.

111
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,680
And this also goes for inline,
context and syntax context.

112
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:51,410
So here we're using a couple of the
same, items in a more inline, version.

113
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,340
So b can emphasize a path
or a certain variable.

114
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,950
quotes can highlight certain
sections of a sentence.

115
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,380
We can use placeholders like a name.

116
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,190
We can later on.

117
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:07,220
I fill in with the real person's name
or capitalization to really emphasize

118
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:12,160
that word or even special characters
to, to maybe get some comments or

119
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,150
clarification on certain parts, like
giving a key value relationship.

120
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,030
and XML text.

121
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,500
These are really, nice, especially in
Cloud AI by, by Anthropic XML text can

122
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,250
really emphasize what different sections
are about and label those accordingly.

123
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:35,140
Next to the formatting and, the way of
writing, you can also give some context

124
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:41,310
to, The certain approaches or prompt
engineering techniques you can add to

125
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,200
this, you can use to communicate with AI.

126
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,720
And here are some well proven prompting
techniques that, at this moment, during

127
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,460
that phase where I started to, go
on this trip, got to learn and, know

128
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,520
what they meant and how they work.

129
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,330
and let's go for a couple of them.

130
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,900
You're probably familiar
with the role prompt.

131
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,020
It's maybe one of the most
famous prompting techniques.

132
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:10,170
this is where you tell the AI to act in a
certain way by imitating a certain role.

133
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:17,470
And it looks like this, where you say,
Act as a fill in the blank and then ask

134
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,950
for a task that this, role would, fulfill.

135
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,720
I think it's a really nice,
prompt, but I think there can

136
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,330
be some improvements on this.

137
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,960
I will show that late later on.

138
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,320
Another prompting technique
is the unfinished chat prompt.

139
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,850
this really interesting, fun
and can be surprisingly useful.

140
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,430
I even got it by accident.

141
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,470
Some, sometimes.

142
00:08:37,795 --> 00:08:43,885
this prompt focuses on building towards
a question and then by simulating

143
00:08:44,095 --> 00:08:48,745
a chat with another person and then
stopping right at the moment where the

144
00:08:48,745 --> 00:08:51,275
answer from the other person would be.

145
00:08:51,695 --> 00:08:56,865
And then have the ai, continue
your, your chat message, with,

146
00:08:56,915 --> 00:08:58,205
with the ex, with the answer.

147
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,770
So the next example here you can see
is, me wanting to, know how to change

148
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,520
my, dark and light mode on my phone.

149
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,010
And I'm submitting this chat with
an Apple support employee stopping

150
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,970
at the moment where the employee
is going to give me an answer.

151
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,880
and here it provides a clear answer
on, it has the context of a chat.

152
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,160
And in this context, it will
give me the right answer.

153
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,730
Another known one is syrup shot prompting.

154
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,460
This technique is just handing
over question without any examples.

155
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,920
For example, translate this into that.

156
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,570
and then it just go goes along.

157
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,310
but here, it's.

158
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,460
pretty obvious that with zero
shot prompting, you will also

159
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,720
have a few shot prompting.

160
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,880
And this technique, you'll have a
little bit more control over the

161
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,470
output by showing some examples.

162
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:56,140
So it continues that, that feel
and aesthetic of those examples.

163
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,530
but it can also be more fixed on too much
stuck on the examples that were given.

164
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:08,660
So at one of the mornings of our trip,
we wanted to get some pastries and we

165
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:13,980
asked the employee of the, of the hotel
to guide us to a local bakery, which

166
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,110
where we could get the local, pastries.

167
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,740
And he told us to go to the boulevard and
we went there on the sunny, summer day.

168
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:24,660
there was some music playing outside
and we entered the shop and the shop

169
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,620
was full with all kinds of pies,
cakes, and these different, pastries.

170
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,230
behind the counter was a bakery
and we started to pick like

171
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,470
which pie do we want to get?

172
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,060
And they all looked very tasteful.

173
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,500
this bakery was looking at
me often What do you want?

174
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,880
which pie do you like?

175
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,840
and then I ask him, give me the
recipe of your best apple pie.

176
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,530
And this feels weird, right?

177
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,440
Because if I ask a baker to act like
something, it's a different context.

178
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,140
and this context is for
us very understandable.

179
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,920
It's not suitable in this bakery.

180
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,860
It is not fitting, but in
language, it doesn't show that.

181
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,760
and this is what I like to
call implicit conversations.

182
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,710
So this sentence, give me lyrics
for a road trip song in the summer.

183
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,190
It is not as clear.

184
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,270
What is the context?

185
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:21,280
I can ask this to a child of 11 years
old and don't get really good results.

186
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:25,260
Or I can ask this to a big,
artist, a music artist.

187
00:11:25,905 --> 00:11:27,745
Who can give me a really good lyrics.

188
00:11:28,245 --> 00:11:30,345
so this sentence doesn't
convey that context.

189
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:34,995
Now, when I have this sentence,
the music you make is amazing, for

190
00:11:35,015 --> 00:11:36,725
listening to while being on a road trip.

191
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:40,535
After five number one hits, what will
the lyrics of your new road trip song be?

192
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:46,340
And this will get a different result
of, lyrics and probably more high

193
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,460
quality result because this has way
more context inside this sentence.

194
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:58,375
so this is what I like to, do is to have
the context be part of the conversation

195
00:11:58,675 --> 00:12:02,065
instead of always mentioning the
context or mentioning in context that

196
00:12:02,065 --> 00:12:04,635
you maybe do not want like an actor.

197
00:12:04,835 --> 00:12:08,595
it's not as good in the end result
is that the actual, profession he

198
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,515
is acting about, would do that.

199
00:12:11,015 --> 00:12:15,095
And I hope this talk made you aware
of how important that context is

200
00:12:15,325 --> 00:12:19,645
and some guidelines to use that
context to, engineer your prompt.

201
00:12:20,015 --> 00:12:23,935
I'd like to thank you for your
attention and hope to see you next time.
