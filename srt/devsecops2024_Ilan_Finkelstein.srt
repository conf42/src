00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,140
Hi, I'm Elon Finkelstein.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,580
I'm Peter Van Eyfren.

3
00:00:04,199 --> 00:00:07,330
And today we're going to
talk about the CISO is dead.

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,040
Now what?

5
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:13,679
Building quality DR, IR, and
BCP exercises and simulations.

6
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:16,949
Very quickly, as mentioned,
I'm Elon Finkelstein.

7
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:19,839
I'm a principal security architect
on the security development

8
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:21,929
team at OWN by Salesforce.

9
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:23,879
I can be reached at elon.

10
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:25,299
finkelstein at owndata.

11
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:25,749
com.

12
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:27,899
I'm also available on LinkedIn.

13
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:33,529
I currently have a master's in
cybersecurity from NYU, a bachelor's

14
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:37,869
of science in computer science from
John Jay, and I'm multiple times AWS

15
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:40,239
certified and a member of ISC squared.

16
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,159
Hi, I'm Peter Van Iperen.

17
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,062
As I mentioned, I am the chief
information I'm a former Deputy

18
00:00:45,062 --> 00:00:47,136
CISO at Clear, Fox, and Disney.

19
00:00:47,136 --> 00:00:49,556
I also have a Master's in Cybersecurity.

20
00:00:49,556 --> 00:00:53,013
I'm a former Deputy CISO
at Clear, Fox, and Disney.

21
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:56,470
I'm a former Deputy CISO
at Clear, Fox, and Disney.

22
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,889
I also have a Master's in Cybersecurity.

23
00:00:59,069 --> 00:01:03,619
And I have, 25, more than
25 cyber certifications.

24
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:06,119
I also, teach some cybersecurity courses.

25
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:10,739
Okay, so very quickly, we're
going to just talk about our

26
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:13,109
overall topics for today's talk.

27
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:15,799
we're going to walk through an
introduction, a quick review of the

28
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:20,039
terminology, developing real world
possibilities, introducing randomness

29
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:24,399
into exercises, conceptualizing
Black Swan events, gaining

30
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:27,199
management buy in, including others.

31
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:29,509
And then some follow up
and conclusion points.

32
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:34,119
So very quickly into the terminology,
in order to build a common body of

33
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:38,899
knowledge, disaster recovery or DR is an
organization's ability to restore access

34
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:42,949
and functionality to IT infrastructure
after a disaster event, whether

35
00:01:42,949 --> 00:01:44,739
natural or caused by human action.

36
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:49,819
I think what's more important here
is not what this definition says, but

37
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,779
what it doesn't say, which is, it's
restore access and functionality to

38
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:55,779
IT infrastructure, but really it's.

39
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:57,704
What keeps you operating?

40
00:01:58,204 --> 00:02:00,234
Second would be incident response.

41
00:02:00,324 --> 00:02:03,824
Incident response is the actions that an
organization takes when it believes IT

42
00:02:04,074 --> 00:02:06,104
systems or data may have been breached.

43
00:02:06,804 --> 00:02:10,985
security, for instance, security
professionals will act if they see

44
00:02:10,985 --> 00:02:15,265
evidence of an unauthorized user,
malware, or failure of security measures.

45
00:02:15,305 --> 00:02:16,445
That's from Microsoft.

46
00:02:16,945 --> 00:02:20,205
BCP, or business continuity
planning, that's documentation of

47
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:23,515
a predetermined set of instructions
or procedures that describe how an

48
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:27,475
organization's mission slash business
principles will be sustained during

49
00:02:27,575 --> 00:02:29,585
and after a significant disruption.

50
00:02:29,994 --> 00:02:30,944
That's from NIST.

51
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:33,124
And finally, a black swan event.

52
00:02:33,495 --> 00:02:36,715
A black swan event is an event
that defies expectations.

53
00:02:36,985 --> 00:02:40,695
They carry extreme consequences and
are only understood in hindsight.

54
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:42,785
That Forbes.

55
00:02:43,405 --> 00:02:44,975
I think a good example is.

56
00:02:45,195 --> 00:02:45,505
COVID.

57
00:02:45,985 --> 00:02:49,755
COVID was the black swan event
of the last 10 years, right?

58
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:53,545
No one saw it coming, totally
unexpected, shut down almost everything.

59
00:02:54,045 --> 00:02:57,165
And I, I think another type of black
swan that we have to look at here

60
00:02:57,215 --> 00:03:01,285
very seriously in this is, not throw
anyone under the bus, but CrowdStrike.

61
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,915
CrowdStrike, what happened
inside CrowdStrike, probably

62
00:03:04,915 --> 00:03:06,135
preventable, predictable.

63
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:09,915
the effects that occurred
to the rest of the world.

64
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,210
Not so much.

65
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:18,620
and I think that we need to really look
at, true code, black, and then, and events

66
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,850
that, start out as something predictable,
small problems that, aren't taken care of

67
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,119
in places, and they build into something
that has truly unpredictable consequences.

68
00:03:27,619 --> 00:03:28,789
Yeah, absolutely.

69
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:30,269
Absolutely.

70
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:36,289
So in developing exercises, we want
to build quality simulations that rely

71
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:38,219
on a whole bunch of different factors.

72
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:42,969
some of the ones that we want to talk
about are clear purpose, well defined,

73
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:48,349
authentic, interesting, exciting,
unpredictable, inclusive, and automated.

74
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:52,309
clear purpose, successful exercises
begin with a straightforward and

75
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:54,059
simple explanation of the goals.

76
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:58,059
That's really just basically
laying out exactly what the idea

77
00:03:58,059 --> 00:04:02,319
is, what our plan to do here is
and what the end result will be.

78
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:07,909
and the more clarity we can provide
our participants, the easier and much

79
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,529
more fun that these exercises will be.

80
00:04:11,029 --> 00:04:16,769
And I think we should note here that
when we say Expectation of the end goals.

81
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,919
It's what is the outcome?

82
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,659
What are we more prepared for?

83
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:21,869
What have we learned from this?

84
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:27,909
Not this is how the beginning and end
of this simulation occur, everyone.

85
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:31,609
I think that's precisely what
we're here to talk about not doing.

86
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,584
So I just want to make
sure we clarify that.

87
00:04:34,084 --> 00:04:36,684
Next up is well defined, right?

88
00:04:36,714 --> 00:04:42,284
We really want to have a good explanation
of what is fair game, what's out

89
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:47,154
of bounds, and what the parameters
and boundaries of our exercise

90
00:04:47,214 --> 00:04:49,384
include, and also don't include.

91
00:04:49,884 --> 00:04:53,064
Generally speaking,
don't include production.

92
00:04:53,814 --> 00:04:54,764
Don't include production.

93
00:04:55,174 --> 00:04:56,034
I'm going to say it one more time.

94
00:04:56,604 --> 00:04:58,144
Don't include production.

95
00:04:58,644 --> 00:05:01,864
Next, we want to make sure that
our exercises are authentic.

96
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:06,044
So they need to be built on real
world possibilities and true

97
00:05:06,054 --> 00:05:08,544
potentialities for the organization.

98
00:05:09,044 --> 00:05:13,994
I would just add to that, that, true
possibilities, true potentialities,

99
00:05:14,964 --> 00:05:16,604
flexible, and you're thinking of that.

100
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:19,354
Precisely to the point of what
we'll talk about later in this

101
00:05:19,364 --> 00:05:21,494
talk, black swans are unpredictable.

102
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:24,824
there is a reason that the U.

103
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:24,954
S.

104
00:05:24,954 --> 00:05:29,994
military has plans for,
a zombie, apocalypse.

105
00:05:30,094 --> 00:05:34,864
It's not because they think a zombie
apocalypse is going to happen, but

106
00:05:34,864 --> 00:05:40,874
it's because it illuminates all the
different problems that, rear their heads

107
00:05:40,934 --> 00:05:42,814
when dealing with an issue like that.

108
00:05:43,504 --> 00:05:49,484
So I think, be flexible in the thinking
of what is, included in your exercises.

109
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:54,284
Better to be more prepared, for
things that might be somewhat unreal.

110
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:58,879
Then, not prepared for things that
could be very real, a la COVID.

111
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:00,309
Absolutely.

112
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:01,759
Absolutely.

113
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:06,019
Next thing we want to do is make
our exercises interesting, right?

114
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:08,519
We need to capture the audience, right?

115
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:13,879
We need to make sure that our
participants, are invested in the game.

116
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:18,759
And we need to do that by developing
enough of a challenge, right?

117
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:19,519
But still something.

118
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:24,149
Solvable, that folks are interested
for long periods of time and don't

119
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:26,009
give up in frustration, right?

120
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:28,319
We don't want them slamming
their hands down and saying, I'm

121
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,339
done, but we also don't want them
finishing in 35 minutes, right?

122
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:36,959
And I also think that, solvable,
achievable graspable is important.

123
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:39,409
always ends in success.

124
00:06:40,294 --> 00:06:45,264
It is not important, and as a matter
of fact, not ending in success is

125
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:49,664
often more important than being
successful in all of these exercises.

126
00:06:50,164 --> 00:06:54,084
I think the next part we want to talk
about is the unpredictability, right?

127
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:58,054
Exercises need to have enough
randomness of events and outcomes,

128
00:06:58,114 --> 00:07:01,894
that keep the participants
interested but also on their toes.

129
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:07,414
So there is no expected outcome,
just to what Peter was saying.

130
00:07:07,914 --> 00:07:11,364
We also want to make sure that
our exercises and simulations

131
00:07:11,374 --> 00:07:12,954
are inclusive, right?

132
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:16,924
We want to remove the typical
cast of characters, right?

133
00:07:16,924 --> 00:07:22,194
Those who are constantly or regularly
involved in incident response, disaster

134
00:07:22,194 --> 00:07:24,674
recovery, or BCP planning, right?

135
00:07:24,674 --> 00:07:28,304
We want to substitute in the folks who
may have less experience, the people

136
00:07:28,304 --> 00:07:31,984
who potentially are the juniors on
the team who have never been involved

137
00:07:32,004 --> 00:07:36,074
Incident Response, or BCP, or DR, right?

138
00:07:36,984 --> 00:07:43,274
That's what's really going to both cross
functionality train our team, but also

139
00:07:43,274 --> 00:07:47,414
help to teach folks who haven't had a
chance to lead an incident or an incident

140
00:07:47,454 --> 00:07:49,694
response how to do so effectively.

141
00:07:50,194 --> 00:07:53,854
They used to have a hard and fast
rule, if you wrote the BCP or the

142
00:07:53,854 --> 00:07:56,174
DR plan, you're not in the exercise.

143
00:07:56,674 --> 00:07:59,084
And I think the final
one is automation, right?

144
00:07:59,084 --> 00:08:02,884
So we want to use scripting and automation
to develop scenarios that unfold

145
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:05,584
without organizer interaction, right?

146
00:08:05,844 --> 00:08:10,784
You don't want to be leading one of
these exercises and Be stuck behind

147
00:08:10,784 --> 00:08:15,214
a keyboard trying to manually trigger
events Trying to generate some sort

148
00:08:15,214 --> 00:08:19,624
of lock that can be used for an alert
creation or anything else, right?

149
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:25,264
We want to be involved with the players
themselves And we want to leave all

150
00:08:25,264 --> 00:08:26,534
of the preparation to an automated

151
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:31,934
And I just want to be clear here, if
anyone leaves this talk thinking, I

152
00:08:32,014 --> 00:08:36,984
need to go, to write simulated triggers
through an AWS environment to do what

153
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:39,214
we're talking about, that'd be fantastic.

154
00:08:39,364 --> 00:08:41,454
and I've seen it done and
I've seen it done really well.

155
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:48,809
Simply numbered and rolling base or,
decisions that are made, sufficiently

156
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:53,239
would bring in enough randomness that
is out of your control and also leaves

157
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:55,689
you from, disengaging with the exercise.

158
00:08:56,189 --> 00:08:58,439
Okay, so introducing randomness.

159
00:08:58,689 --> 00:09:03,869
when we develop these exercises, we
want to make sure that we include

160
00:09:04,369 --> 00:09:07,929
a lacking or definite plan, right?

161
00:09:08,229 --> 00:09:11,679
to introduce exercise, to introduce
randomness into our exercises, it

162
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,469
serves really two purposes, right?

163
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:15,799
We help to maintain the
participant interest.

164
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,162
It also makes our exercises
really authentic, right?

165
00:09:19,162 --> 00:09:23,899
Because nothing that in
a true BCP, DR, or IR.

166
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:27,049
Our situation is going
to be predictable, right?

167
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:28,759
Everything is going to go haywire.

168
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:31,819
Everything, might go out the window
and you need to be prepared for that.

169
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:35,529
And I think when we introduce randomness,
we can do it in a lot of different

170
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:40,379
ways, including rolling dice, including
picking envelopes, including simulated

171
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,389
random number generators and options.

172
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:47,759
I think also something interesting to do
is treat it like it's a real disaster.

173
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:48,839
Take shifts.

174
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:53,299
Make people step away to take
food breaks, to take, go to the

175
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:55,519
bathroom, be a human, get tired.

176
00:09:55,619 --> 00:09:58,169
That's what's going to happen
in a real world scenario.

177
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,929
We're not all going to have a neat
hour and a half break where we all

178
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:03,639
get to have a nice conversation
in the middle of a disaster.

179
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:05,519
so treat it like a real disaster.

180
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:09,989
I think the second part, when it
comes to introducing randomness, is

181
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:12,619
it helps to maintain interest, right?

182
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:17,569
when we're able to limit distractions
and develop something that is really

183
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:22,339
engaging and really interesting
in, to our participants, right?

184
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:27,409
We can keep them involved and we can also
make sure that there's no predictability.

185
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:32,929
We're able to remove any expected
outcome and make the game very

186
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:34,639
interesting and unpredictable.

187
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:38,659
And I think it's important to
dedicate the team to doing that

188
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:40,429
and taking away distractions.

189
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:45,039
And I think it's really important too
that whoever is running the simulation

190
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:48,789
doesn't know when the simulation
is ending or how it's going to end.

191
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:49,399
That is.

192
00:10:49,934 --> 00:10:53,454
That is a disaster or a business
continuity recovery, right?

193
00:10:53,784 --> 00:10:56,924
You don't know when it's going to be over.

194
00:10:57,434 --> 00:11:01,724
And I think that helps keep people engaged
because if you tell people, Hey, we could

195
00:11:01,734 --> 00:11:05,184
be in this room, it could be an hour, it
could be 8 hours, it could be 12 hours.

196
00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:07,844
We're all going to dedicate
ourselves to really simulating this.

197
00:11:08,344 --> 00:11:12,934
You really start to understand what
will occur in a disaster in your teams.

198
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:15,744
And, it also focuses people, right?

199
00:11:15,804 --> 00:11:16,954
just generally speaking.

200
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:20,584
in the first half hour, people
want to check slack after

201
00:11:20,584 --> 00:11:21,834
they've been at it for a while.

202
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:24,894
If they want to avoid the game
and they want to get out, I think

203
00:11:24,894 --> 00:11:27,204
distractions will go away very quickly.

204
00:11:27,704 --> 00:11:28,464
Very good point.

205
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:29,814
Very good point, Peter.

206
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:34,414
And next up, we'll talk about
some Black Swan events, right?

207
00:11:34,754 --> 00:11:39,214
So it's really hard to figure out the
one in a million possibilities, right?

208
00:11:39,604 --> 00:11:43,124
If they were well known, they
wouldn't be Black Swan events, right?

209
00:11:43,374 --> 00:11:46,824
I think a lot of what goes into this
is the creativity and understanding

210
00:11:46,864 --> 00:11:51,754
of your actual environment and
what would really derail it.

211
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:56,044
I think that, how do you stimulate
a black swan event, right?

212
00:11:56,044 --> 00:11:57,984
How do you simulate the unknowable?

213
00:11:58,604 --> 00:12:02,434
I think if you, research and look
at people who study black swan

214
00:12:02,434 --> 00:12:05,454
events, one of the characteristics
is that they're always.

215
00:12:05,954 --> 00:12:08,704
I don't want to say predictable,
but knowable in hindsight.

216
00:12:08,874 --> 00:12:13,454
The reason they're knowable in hindsight
is you can see the seven or eight

217
00:12:13,504 --> 00:12:19,234
factors that interacted with each
other to create that black swan event.

218
00:12:19,744 --> 00:12:24,014
so if you want to simulate
black swan events, create

219
00:12:24,014 --> 00:12:26,124
seven or eight random factors.

220
00:12:26,164 --> 00:12:29,204
Let them interact with each
other and see where things lead.

221
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:31,894
You may not end up in
a black swan scenario.

222
00:12:31,894 --> 00:12:34,794
You may end up in a very
vanilla scenario that, that is.

223
00:12:35,384 --> 00:12:39,264
a typical, DR scenario, someone
kicked the court out, right?

224
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:45,884
but you also may end up with a truly
unique scenario to you that really

225
00:12:45,884 --> 00:12:49,154
starts to highlight how you would
have to act during a black swan event.

226
00:12:49,704 --> 00:12:50,174
definitely.

227
00:12:50,674 --> 00:12:51,014
Now.

228
00:12:51,374 --> 00:12:51,914
Okay.

229
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:53,224
Gaining management buy in.

230
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:58,444
So convincing management that half
the ops team, three quarters of our

231
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:03,064
security resources and legal finance
and product all need to be in the same

232
00:13:03,064 --> 00:13:07,564
room for the next eight hours and not
at their desks is not easy, right?

233
00:13:07,614 --> 00:13:09,204
it's only a few people from the company.

234
00:13:09,274 --> 00:13:10,924
who needs three quarters
of the company working?

235
00:13:11,694 --> 00:13:13,894
It's going to be an uphill battle.

236
00:13:14,364 --> 00:13:15,474
I don't have a lot to add here.

237
00:13:15,484 --> 00:13:17,234
I, in security, we're often.

238
00:13:17,234 --> 00:13:18,103
What is the ROI of
something not happening?

239
00:13:18,103 --> 00:13:19,854
What is the ROI of things
being proven negative?

240
00:13:19,854 --> 00:13:23,579
Ah, what's the ROI of
something that not happening?

241
00:13:24,109 --> 00:13:25,629
and preventing the bad
thing from happening.

242
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:29,479
but I do think, Ilan, you have some
good points, pointers here on how

243
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:32,229
we can help people make a case.

244
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:34,279
So absolutely.

245
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:38,509
So really quickly, we need to
have a good understanding of

246
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:40,509
what motivates business, right?

247
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:44,009
Typically, business is motivated by So
I think in this case, I think it's just

248
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:46,389
about the ability to supply the ability
to continue to be in business, right?

249
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:48,839
Our ability to be successful.

250
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:53,279
and some of that comes down to
our ability to make sure that

251
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:57,739
our systems are continuous, that
we're, our data is not leaked.

252
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:00,149
in addition to being able
to make money, right?

253
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:04,569
So I think if we're able to show
the value add that a lot of DR, BCP

254
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:09,669
or IR exercises can bring to the
organization, we're able to see much

255
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:11,649
more buy in from our leadership.

256
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:15,659
to really help make this point, we
have some really good stats here that

257
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:18,799
hopefully can help as you translate
them to your business leaders.

258
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:24,269
So very quickly in terms of BCP,
continuity breaks cost somewhere between

259
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:28,409
137 to 16, 000 per minute, right?

260
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:31,689
Nine out of 10 businesses
experience one or more continuity

261
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:33,909
breaks in a quarter, right?

262
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:38,669
And I think this is just a really
important thing to hit home on here.

263
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:44,369
I think often when people try to make
these cases, they try to say, the

264
00:14:44,369 --> 00:14:46,469
average cost of a server going out.

265
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:50,189
we have that here, but really
the most important thing in this

266
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:53,899
slide is 9 businesses experience
one or more outages per quarter.

267
00:14:53,979 --> 00:14:57,449
Go find that last outage, go
talk to the product people,

268
00:14:57,449 --> 00:14:58,809
go talk to the sales people.

269
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:03,949
Go find out how much that
outage cost for your business.

270
00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:08,139
And look at the time that it was out
and then go make that multiplication.

271
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:08,929
It's the multiplication.

272
00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:15,209
That loss of revenue or that refund
to a customer, et cetera, is a much

273
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:21,819
healthier and more significant argument
than how much it costs to fix a server.

274
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:22,999
Absolutely.

275
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,569
Absolutely.

276
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:27,333
So some really quick DR stats, right?

277
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:32,279
Corporations lose 40 percent of employee
productivity during outages, right?

278
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:36,279
30 percent of organizations
permanently lose data and more than

279
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:38,422
two Thirds of how do I do that?

280
00:15:38,422 --> 00:15:41,427
Where you see all these big companies that
have large outages cost companies over

281
00:15:41,427 --> 00:15:42,715
a hundred thousand dollars in revenue.

282
00:15:42,715 --> 00:15:43,285
Sorry, go ahead.

283
00:15:43,665 --> 00:15:43,985
No.

284
00:15:44,065 --> 00:15:47,635
taking this all back to your
leadership helps to make that case.

285
00:15:48,635 --> 00:15:53,235
And I think just again, focusing
in this slide here on people know

286
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:56,625
what it means if 40 percent of
people can't work, especially

287
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,255
recently people live through COVID.

288
00:15:58,295 --> 00:15:59,225
They understand that.

289
00:15:59,245 --> 00:16:02,735
I think the other really important
one on here is 30 percent of

290
00:16:02,735 --> 00:16:04,615
organizations permanently lose data.

291
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,015
In your scenario, I am.

292
00:16:07,015 --> 00:16:12,235
Encourage everyone in your scenario,
somehow lose data, somehow have

293
00:16:12,235 --> 00:16:16,225
data inaccessible, even if it's
through randomness and it's how

294
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:20,305
much of the data or et cetera, but
have them feel the effect of not

295
00:16:20,305 --> 00:16:21,895
having data at their fingertips.

296
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:28,015
Businesses operate on data and the only
thing scarier to lose in revenue is data.

297
00:16:28,105 --> 00:16:32,935
'cause data loss always leads to
revenue loss 100% of the time.

298
00:16:32,935 --> 00:16:35,155
It leads to revenue loss
in one way or another.

299
00:16:35,655 --> 00:16:36,405
Really good point.

300
00:16:36,855 --> 00:16:37,845
Really good point.

301
00:16:38,745 --> 00:16:42,395
And I think the third one is probably
one of the easiest cases to make,

302
00:16:42,455 --> 00:16:44,685
and that's the IR stats, right?

303
00:16:45,035 --> 00:16:48,465
IR is probably the most well known of
all the things we're talking about today.

304
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,675
But again, these stats are overwhelming
when we present them to leadership, right?

305
00:16:52,985 --> 00:16:54,925
Ransomware gangs collected 1.

306
00:16:54,925 --> 00:16:59,115
1 billion in 2023 from
their victims, right?

307
00:16:59,115 --> 00:16:59,305
72.

308
00:16:59,305 --> 00:17:03,305
7 percent of organizations worldwide
have experienced ransomware

309
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:06,455
attacks in 2023 alone, right?

310
00:17:06,745 --> 00:17:12,675
And cyber Cyberattacks exposed health
records of 25%, 1 in 4 people, in

311
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:15,645
the first 9 months alone in 2023.

312
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:19,205
So the idea that you're not going
to start to prepare for these

313
00:17:19,235 --> 00:17:21,885
basically eventualities seems silly.

314
00:17:22,385 --> 00:17:28,165
And I think just adding to that
too, the ransomware and attack

315
00:17:28,165 --> 00:17:30,835
landscape is shifting significantly.

316
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:34,705
You're seeing more places where
data will just be exposed,

317
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:36,125
data will not be returned.

318
00:17:36,495 --> 00:17:37,105
I, Brandon.

319
00:17:37,165 --> 00:17:40,725
It's where gangs don't want to negotiate,
insurance companies don't want to pay.

320
00:17:41,675 --> 00:17:48,495
So again, adding that randomness, adding
that fluidity into your simulations

321
00:17:48,515 --> 00:17:52,325
is more important than ever, because
when you are faced with something

322
00:17:52,325 --> 00:17:59,155
like this, which 73 percent of us were
faced with in one year alone, you don't

323
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:01,775
know what you're going to be facing.

324
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,385
and it's something at,
in the security industry.

325
00:18:04,535 --> 00:18:08,915
community we talk about all the time,
but other business leaders don't realize

326
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:14,495
that and assume that there's one or two
really easy ways out of these scenarios.

327
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:18,825
And I think it's really important for them
to understand that's not often the case.

328
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,195
absolutely.

329
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:24,955
Okay, I think we're coming into another
really important part of a successful

330
00:18:24,955 --> 00:18:27,055
exercise, and that's including others.

331
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:32,270
So when we talk about including others,
once we have management buy in, right?

332
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,740
We want other teams to participate, right?

333
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,420
When we operate in, let's say,
DR, BCP, or IR world, right?

334
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,750
We're not operating with
only technical folks, right?

335
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:48,940
We need to make sure that all of the
teams involved in an incident, right?

336
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,110
Any of those types of incidents
will be prepared, right?

337
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,540
And by doing so, We can ensure that,
again, we have a better incident

338
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,850
response or IR or DR or BCP.

339
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:06,930
So I think if you're performing a
simulation and a lot, we're looking at

340
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:10,900
the list of teams here, and I want you
to tell us why it's important, but I just

341
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,410
want to say to everyone, if you're doing a
simulation and it doesn't involve at least

342
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,960
two of these other groups on here, you
shouldn't be doing the simulation because

343
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,670
you're not simulating something serious.

344
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,849
You can have a big enough that it
actually matters to simulate it.

345
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:28,340
You're not rehearsing something
that is actually, significantly

346
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,077
damaging to the company and that's
what we need to prepare for.

347
00:19:32,077 --> 00:19:36,817
many of the little things we can
handle, it's the big things where we

348
00:19:36,817 --> 00:19:39,707
need cooperation and we need to know
that things will continue operating.

349
00:19:40,207 --> 00:19:40,487
Go ahead.

350
00:19:41,027 --> 00:19:41,467
Absolutely.

351
00:19:41,877 --> 00:19:47,107
And I think some of those teams
that operate during, whether it's a

352
00:19:47,197 --> 00:19:51,017
DR, RBCP or IR in real life world.

353
00:19:51,187 --> 00:19:56,077
include finance, legal, our C suites,
our physical security teams, and

354
00:19:56,077 --> 00:19:58,217
our marketing and PR teams, right?

355
00:19:58,547 --> 00:20:03,297
Because as technologists, we are only
privy to a small scope of the business.

356
00:20:03,677 --> 00:20:06,997
These folks handle the other
important pieces of the business.

357
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:13,467
And I think that, going back to the cogent
title of this talk, the CISO is dead.

358
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:16,557
which is something we talk
about internally here.

359
00:20:17,057 --> 00:20:19,687
I like to think I won the lottery,
but I'm fairly certain a lawn

360
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:20,797
kills me in a plane crash.

361
00:20:21,107 --> 00:20:24,187
regardless, I think it's
important, especially across

362
00:20:24,187 --> 00:20:25,627
the C suite, to do that, right?

363
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:31,207
Often in these plans you have that legal,
or privacy, or your chief legal counsel

364
00:20:31,217 --> 00:20:37,057
or someone like that will sign off on
the language that's released, or, your

365
00:20:37,087 --> 00:20:38,627
internal comms, or something like that.

366
00:20:39,337 --> 00:20:42,217
we often don't look at who the
backups are for these people.

367
00:20:42,877 --> 00:20:46,067
And we They often take for granted
that these people will be available,

368
00:20:46,087 --> 00:20:50,297
and the first thing that will occur
in a real world scenario, in a real

369
00:20:50,297 --> 00:20:54,287
disaster, especially a large scale
black swan event, is some of these

370
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:55,547
people are just not going to be there.

371
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:57,397
They're not going to be available.

372
00:20:57,817 --> 00:21:02,697
And the last thing you
want to do is not know who.

373
00:21:03,647 --> 00:21:06,457
If you don't know who, you're paralyzed.

374
00:21:06,507 --> 00:21:08,737
And that is literally
the number one thing.

375
00:21:08,807 --> 00:21:10,517
People can do things.

376
00:21:11,147 --> 00:21:13,337
If people, but what's the point?

377
00:21:13,347 --> 00:21:17,077
It's the old saying a long, a
person is smart, people are dumb,

378
00:21:17,147 --> 00:21:19,217
a crowd is dangerous, right?

379
00:21:19,747 --> 00:21:23,957
People in a group, a crowd of
people getting on a phone, no

380
00:21:23,957 --> 00:21:26,447
one knows who's supposed to be
doing what, who's in control.

381
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,127
Things are going to go sideways really
quickly, so I think that's really

382
00:21:30,127 --> 00:21:31,607
important to bring into your scenarios.

383
00:21:32,107 --> 00:21:34,337
And you get to kill me in a plane
crash, so who doesn't want to,

384
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:35,577
take their boss out for a day?

385
00:21:36,077 --> 00:21:38,427
I guess now we can get
into our conclusion.

386
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:40,357
I guess the first conclusion
The final conclusion from this

387
00:21:40,357 --> 00:21:42,697
talk is the CISO is not dead.

388
00:21:42,727 --> 00:21:44,977
He's very much alive and here with us.

389
00:21:45,377 --> 00:21:46,917
So that's a plus.

390
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:51,677
but also, it's developing really
interesting and seemingly random exercises

391
00:21:51,707 --> 00:21:53,777
requires time and attention to detail.

392
00:21:53,847 --> 00:22:00,147
it requires management buy in and
also a level of authenticity, while

393
00:22:00,147 --> 00:22:02,647
being anything but average, right?

394
00:22:03,357 --> 00:22:05,837
So like we talked about,
you want to include some of

395
00:22:05,837 --> 00:22:07,317
those black swan type events.

396
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:10,087
You want We want to make sure
that you're not utilizing the same

397
00:22:10,087 --> 00:22:14,227
resources that are utilized every
time a real incident occurs, right?

398
00:22:14,227 --> 00:22:17,517
We want to make sure that none of
the incidents or simulations that

399
00:22:17,517 --> 00:22:22,247
we're developing fit into any of our
established playbooks, and we want to

400
00:22:22,247 --> 00:22:26,347
make sure that we really keep things
interesting for our participants.

401
00:22:26,397 --> 00:22:28,337
And inclusivity helps a lot with that.

402
00:22:28,837 --> 00:22:32,997
I just to take the temperature really
quick here too, I would just say that

403
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:38,387
if you run simulations once or twice a
year, and When everyone walks away from

404
00:22:38,387 --> 00:22:42,787
that simulation feeling really good
about themselves, you've done it wrong.

405
00:22:43,557 --> 00:22:45,477
Just hands down, you've done it wrong.

406
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:49,297
I don't care if you do it twice a
year, every year for the past ten

407
00:22:49,297 --> 00:22:53,907
years, if you walk away feeling
good, you're not doing it right.

408
00:22:53,947 --> 00:22:58,757
The whole point of doing these
simulations is to be over prepared.

409
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:02,297
You should be losing, you should
be noticing things that are wrong,

410
00:23:02,317 --> 00:23:06,677
and you should be walking away
with kind of an ick in your gut.

411
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:10,967
oh, this isn't, this is,
we didn't account for this.

412
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:15,067
If you're not doing that, and that's
at least not happening at least the C

413
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:19,037
suite level, you're not doing something
right, and you need to reevaluate

414
00:23:19,037 --> 00:23:20,517
how you're handling your simulations.

415
00:23:21,017 --> 00:23:21,787
Absolutely.

416
00:23:22,127 --> 00:23:22,957
Absolutely.

417
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:28,627
I guess the next piece to just follow up
on once more is that when we're developing

418
00:23:28,627 --> 00:23:32,297
these exercises, including members of
departments that are peripheral and

419
00:23:32,297 --> 00:23:34,707
not necessarily technologists, right?

420
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:35,187
Enhancing.

421
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:36,817
It extends our overall unity.

422
00:23:36,907 --> 00:23:40,907
It helps to prepare us for when we are
on calls with these folks, during real

423
00:23:40,927 --> 00:23:43,187
incidents or during real responses.

424
00:23:43,517 --> 00:23:49,247
And it also builds some sort of
cohesion, That exists going into the

425
00:23:49,247 --> 00:23:52,737
next real live disaster recovery event.

426
00:23:52,787 --> 00:23:56,197
Or business continuity event
or a real incident response.

427
00:23:56,377 --> 00:23:57,417
Oh, I, can I ask you a question?

428
00:23:57,597 --> 00:23:57,937
Sure.

429
00:23:58,627 --> 00:24:01,607
If we, if we kill a
computer, does it complain?

430
00:24:01,947 --> 00:24:02,257
No.

431
00:24:02,757 --> 00:24:04,957
We talk about shooting
computers like cattle, right?

432
00:24:04,997 --> 00:24:05,367
Yes.

433
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:11,167
I'm fairly certain that computers are
not what matters when something breaks.

434
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,387
The customers matter.

435
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:15,197
The clients matter.

436
00:24:15,877 --> 00:24:17,787
The workers matter.

437
00:24:18,552 --> 00:24:22,132
And I'm fairly certain that last
time I checked, InfoSecurity doesn't

438
00:24:22,132 --> 00:24:23,792
manage all those departments, right?

439
00:24:24,002 --> 00:24:24,272
No.

440
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:29,272
you're not having a real
disaster if only InfoSecurity

441
00:24:29,632 --> 00:24:31,302
is involved in your simulation.

442
00:24:31,842 --> 00:24:32,492
Absolutely.

443
00:24:33,462 --> 00:24:34,182
Absolutely.

444
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:39,082
And I guess the last couple of things is
just to make sure that these exercises

445
00:24:39,082 --> 00:24:41,342
are fun and interesting, right?

446
00:24:41,892 --> 00:24:46,662
but also making sure that you have
the organizational support, and

447
00:24:46,672 --> 00:24:50,752
getting an executive sponsor, along
with providing that sponsor and your

448
00:24:50,752 --> 00:24:54,682
management clarity about what the
exercise entails and what they can

449
00:24:54,682 --> 00:24:56,722
help to do to ensure success, right?

450
00:24:56,762 --> 00:25:00,342
Like we talked about in the management
buy in really makes a big difference.

451
00:25:00,812 --> 00:25:03,782
Because at the end of the day we
want to do this multiple times.

452
00:25:03,872 --> 00:25:06,542
We want to continue to practice,
continue to build, continue to

453
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:07,862
grow, and continue to improve.

454
00:25:08,272 --> 00:25:10,802
And the only way we can do that
is by continuing to practice.

455
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:14,812
And I think continuing to practice
means that we need to take what

456
00:25:14,812 --> 00:25:16,782
we did wrong and evaluate it.

457
00:25:17,197 --> 00:25:23,437
In a way that isn't repercussion based,
isn't consequence based, but is instead

458
00:25:23,437 --> 00:25:28,327
improvement based and say, okay, next time
we're going to do this better and we're

459
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:31,517
going to evaluate ourselves to make sure
that we're going in the right direction.

460
00:25:31,517 --> 00:25:36,137
And I think that if we can show
market improvement every time, it,

461
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:40,417
you will gain that executive buy
in and that sponsorship, right?

462
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:40,957
There is

463
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:46,647
at a certain level, everyone's
job becomes basically care.

464
00:25:47,147 --> 00:25:48,557
That's what you do for a living.

465
00:25:49,407 --> 00:25:54,287
And, what keeps you up at night
is the inability to take a problem

466
00:25:54,697 --> 00:25:56,507
that's gonna come along and solve it.

467
00:25:57,317 --> 00:26:02,127
having the confidence in the fact that
You can have an outright disaster come

468
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:11,857
along and you will at least be given the
time and opportunity to figure out how to

469
00:26:11,967 --> 00:26:16,307
solve that through your disaster recovery,
through your business continuity,

470
00:26:16,607 --> 00:26:19,967
through your incident response, and
know that it will work when the big

471
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:23,257
one comes and that you will not be S.

472
00:26:23,257 --> 00:26:23,377
O.

473
00:26:23,377 --> 00:26:23,687
L.

474
00:26:24,187 --> 00:26:25,247
Pardon my French.

475
00:26:25,747 --> 00:26:31,967
is something that most executives, when
they understand the value of that, will

476
00:26:32,427 --> 00:26:37,417
110 percent support, building out a
program that does these simulations, and

477
00:26:37,417 --> 00:26:41,497
most importantly, building them out in
a way that's random, and building them

478
00:26:41,497 --> 00:26:45,777
out in a way that one day, they will
be the C suite officer and they Who is

479
00:26:45,777 --> 00:26:50,557
dead, and volunteering to do that, to
see how their team responds and react.

480
00:26:51,107 --> 00:26:52,797
so a lot of final words.

481
00:26:53,507 --> 00:26:57,737
no, just to go out there and have
fun and thank everyone so much.

482
00:26:57,837 --> 00:26:59,557
really appreciate you joining our talk.

483
00:27:00,057 --> 00:27:03,647
Peter's not dead, so if anyone comes
and knocks on my door, I didn't

484
00:27:03,647 --> 00:27:05,277
kill him, it was someone else.

485
00:27:05,777 --> 00:27:08,557
However, do know, I do turn up dead.

486
00:27:09,057 --> 00:27:12,087
There is a gentleman we're watching
right now, who we should talk

487
00:27:12,087 --> 00:27:14,007
to first, before anyone else.

488
00:27:14,747 --> 00:27:15,157
But seriously.

489
00:27:15,377 --> 00:27:21,107
It was great doing Elon, and I
think that, This is something that

490
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:23,637
is so overlooked in our arena.

491
00:27:24,037 --> 00:27:29,737
it's often a compliance checkbox and
yet, it proves time and time again

492
00:27:29,747 --> 00:27:35,447
to be the most important thing,
that we do, and, really appreciate

493
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:38,157
you including me in this, even
if, you had the threat to kill me.

494
00:27:38,897 --> 00:27:40,437
So thank you so much.

495
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:41,707
