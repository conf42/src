1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,250
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,870
Welcome to Con 42 Cube Native 2025.

3
00:00:05,369 --> 00:00:06,659
I'm S Ula.

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,239
I work as a principal
full stack engineers.

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:15,209
Today my presentation topic is
architecting resilient risk governance.

6
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:18,680
Let's go to the today's agenda.

7
00:00:19,459 --> 00:00:24,764
Today we'll introduce the modern
risk landscape and we will discuss.

8
00:00:25,534 --> 00:00:31,014
The challenge with the current system,
and then we will discuss the three

9
00:00:31,014 --> 00:00:35,035
pillars of resilient risk governance.

10
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:41,234
Once after that, we will discuss the
implementation and adaption strategy.

11
00:00:41,894 --> 00:00:47,115
And finally, we'll discuss
measuring success and the feature.

12
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:48,755
Let's come to the introduction.

13
00:00:49,255 --> 00:00:57,235
So this presentation is about building
a smart and strong immune system for the

14
00:00:57,235 --> 00:01:00,985
banks and for the financial companies.

15
00:01:01,405 --> 00:01:06,355
So we have three challenges as
part of these like regulatory

16
00:01:06,355 --> 00:01:12,685
complexity, technology evolution,
and third sophisticated threats as

17
00:01:12,685 --> 00:01:16,675
part of the regulatory complexity
rules and reg regulation.

18
00:01:16,675 --> 00:01:18,595
Sir. Frequently changing.

19
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:20,515
It is difficult to adapt.

20
00:01:21,025 --> 00:01:28,405
And also the second one, technology
evolution, which is very first

21
00:01:28,825 --> 00:01:32,785
and very quick for adapting
the digital transformation

22
00:01:33,565 --> 00:01:36,175
demanding architectural agility.

23
00:01:36,895 --> 00:01:39,445
Third one is sophisticated threats.

24
00:01:39,895 --> 00:01:45,895
The fraudsters are smart and they're
exploiting system vulnerabilities.

25
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,480
That is also another
third challenging one.

26
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,780
Let's come to the fragmentation problem.

27
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,760
Majorly, we have a fragmentation
problem in most companies.

28
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,240
We do have the different departments
like customer department, trading

29
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,389
department, and compliance department.

30
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,610
Each department, they're
maintaining their own dataset.

31
00:02:12,109 --> 00:02:19,029
Because of that, we will have like
major impacts and also nobody can see

32
00:02:19,029 --> 00:02:20,739
the full picture of the data flow.

33
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:28,749
Because of this, it makes slow down
to identify the risks, and it is

34
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:35,940
very easy to miss some important
rules and further to overcome.

35
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:40,695
Enterprise architecture
as a strategic backbone.

36
00:02:41,475 --> 00:02:47,714
Just think of it as a model
blueprint for the entire company.

37
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:55,575
It connects all the disconnected
parts, making sure data rules and

38
00:02:55,575 --> 00:03:02,339
technology work together smoothly
as one powerful system that is the.

39
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:07,599
Main advantage with enterprise
architecture coming to three

40
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,899
pillars of resilient risk.

41
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:16,459
Governances like first pillars,
integrated data ecosystem.

42
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:21,549
It means it's connected
data, which everyone.

43
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,850
Should share the information instantly.

44
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,600
And second one is adaptive compliance.

45
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,640
As part of that adaptive compliance, it's
like nothing but automatic compliance.

46
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:40,325
The system checks file
rule breakdown 24 by seven.

47
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:45,144
And third one is a driven
fraud defense that is like

48
00:03:45,474 --> 00:03:47,964
smart software that learns to.

49
00:03:48,464 --> 00:03:49,964
Spot Nikki Freight.

50
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:56,195
Let's discuss little deep for
each pillar in our next slides.

51
00:03:56,695 --> 00:04:00,475
See here is the one
integrated data ecosystems.

52
00:04:01,285 --> 00:04:03,870
One is a trading systems, and
another one is a customer data.

53
00:04:04,115 --> 00:04:09,430
Another one is a compliance
platforms and unified risk review.

54
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,520
These all four are majorly.

55
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:18,780
Further integrated data ecosystems
like this is about breaking down

56
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,140
the walls between departments.

57
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:29,160
We connect the data from trading
compliance and customers to create

58
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,830
one single real-time dashboard
that shows all the risks clearly.

59
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:41,750
Breaking down data silos like traditional
approach, isolated departmental

60
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:49,600
database and manual data reconciliation
and delayed risk vulnerabilities.

61
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,790
Inconsistent reporting standards
for this traditional approach.

62
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:00,335
I can say the best example is that
three people are in a separated.

63
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:07,845
In separate rooms and each one trying to
communicate, but they cannot because the

64
00:05:07,845 --> 00:05:14,685
wise is slow and because of that, walls
and three people are in a different rooms.

65
00:05:15,185 --> 00:05:21,190
The wise is messy and the error in the
prawn while talking, while discussing

66
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:26,110
sharing, but that is a traditional
approach, can say the example and.

67
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,950
Architecture LED integration is unified
data, fabric architecture, real time

68
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:37,950
data synchronization, instant risk
assessment capabilities, standardized

69
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,780
government governance frameworks for that.

70
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:48,750
Best example I can say is like
everyone is in one platform and

71
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,770
one room and live group chat with.

72
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,500
Because of that, everyone are in one room.

73
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,820
One group chat so that
what is the outcome?

74
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:05,460
It is very first and accurate, and
everyone will be on the same page.

75
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:11,040
That is what it's an perfect example
for the architecture lead integration.

76
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,730
Second one, adaptive compliance framework.

77
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,790
Adaptive compliance framework,
mainly like embedded controls.

78
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:26,260
And automated reporting, continuous
monitoring, regulatory adoption.

79
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,350
These four are the major things for that.

80
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:37,260
Here in, instead of having people manually
checking thousands of transactions

81
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:44,250
for rule breaking, we can build the
rules directly into the system so that

82
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,460
it automatically checks the rules.

83
00:06:48,195 --> 00:06:49,245
And everything.

84
00:06:49,815 --> 00:06:56,565
It generates a report and it gives
alerts immediately if something is wrong.

85
00:06:56,835 --> 00:07:01,725
That is a major advantage with adapting
or automating compliance framework.

86
00:07:02,175 --> 00:07:06,255
Let's go to the third pillar,
which is most more interesting one

87
00:07:06,305 --> 00:07:11,275
AI driven fraud defense as part
of the AI driven fraud defense.

88
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,740
We have four.

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,130
One is a. Pattern recognition.

90
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,620
And third one is a realtime analysis.

91
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,920
Third one is a legacy, SY
legacy systems integration.

92
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,610
And fourth one is a human oversight.

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,770
So what is that pattern recognition?

94
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:31,620
If anything happens abnormal behavior,
like you know something differently,

95
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:38,910
then we can identify using mission
learning algorithms so that the pattern

96
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,350
recognition plays a very vital role.

97
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,800
Realtime analysis if anything
is strange, the realtime

98
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,140
analysis, it'll give the flag.

99
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:54,630
Coming to the legacy integration,
this AI driven fraud defense if you

100
00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:00,120
integrate our system with the ai, it
automatically works with our world system.

101
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,940
Says that final one is a human oversight.

102
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:09,090
Human oversight is needed to make
sure the final call on tricky cases.

103
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,820
And what are the implementation
challenges and solutions?

104
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,320
So basically organization
organizational resistance.

105
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,980
Basically the people are
not liking the change.

106
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,855
They just want to continue
with the established process.

107
00:08:27,515 --> 00:08:31,295
So that is one major
challenge, how we can welcome.

108
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,570
Such a challenge.

109
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:40,040
Only solution is we need to train them
and we need to roll out challenges slowly.

110
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,950
Not like in not everything at once.

111
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,990
Technical depth is another challenging
Legacy systems integration is very

112
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:55,410
complex compared to modernize technical
things like what is the solution for

113
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,685
legacy systems integration capability.

114
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:07,260
Complexity is we need to use the modern
connectors to link them step by step.

115
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,450
Another one is cost justification.

116
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,100
Cost justification.

117
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:18,610
We need to show like how much
we are saving from the less

118
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:23,190
frauds and how much we are saving
based on the lawyer compliance.

119
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,220
That we need to overcome that.

120
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,470
Another one is phase adaption strategy.

121
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,010
Like we have first four phases.

122
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,870
One is a foundation phase, which
is a very key, and we need to

123
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:45,230
establish data governance standards
and basic integration capabilities.

124
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,520
We all need to agree
on how to manage data.

125
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,265
And the second one is a integration phase.

126
00:09:51,835 --> 00:09:56,905
Integration phase is a, it needs to
connect critical systems and important

127
00:09:56,905 --> 00:09:58,855
systems, which is a most powerful one.

128
00:09:59,755 --> 00:10:01,375
Another one is a intelligent phase.

129
00:10:01,795 --> 00:10:02,725
Intelligent phase.

130
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:06,610
We need to turn on the AI and AI models.

131
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,510
The fourth one is a optimization phase.

132
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,615
It makes.

133
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:17,090
Continuous improvements need to happen
and it keep making it better and bigger.

134
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,470
That's the one.

135
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:26,010
And measuring the success, key
outcome of this one, like I

136
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:30,300
can say 60% faster complaints.

137
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:35,040
Reports that used to take a weeks.

138
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,460
With this, it can take only days.

139
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:43,265
And GT 5% of the better fraud detection.

140
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:51,365
We can catch almost all fraud attempt,
and another one is 40% cost saving.

141
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:53,135
It is a very huge success.

142
00:10:53,135 --> 00:10:53,675
I can say.

143
00:10:54,125 --> 00:11:02,015
We spent less on manual checks and
mistakes, 99% system availability.

144
00:11:02,225 --> 00:11:06,275
The system is always up
and running and reliable.

145
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:10,255
Conclusion, the future of risk governance.

146
00:11:10,755 --> 00:11:15,155
Basically by using this blueprint,
like enterprise architecture

147
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:21,785
companies become strong, agile,
and ready for whatever comes next.

148
00:11:22,285 --> 00:11:29,335
They can grow safely, follow rules
easily, and stay ahead of criminals.

149
00:11:30,085 --> 00:11:34,065
Which gives, they may use
advantage over competitors.

150
00:11:34,565 --> 00:11:36,685
Let's take the key takeaways.

151
00:11:37,345 --> 00:11:43,935
Like I can say, enterprise architecture
is the key to managing risks and connector

152
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,625
connect our data to see the whole picture.

153
00:11:48,585 --> 00:11:50,665
EI enhances fraud detection.

154
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:54,435
And adaption ensures the success.

155
00:11:54,935 --> 00:11:58,325
That's all pretty much
about my today presentation.

156
00:11:58,825 --> 00:11:59,995
It's time for the questions.

157
00:12:00,355 --> 00:12:04,495
If you have any questions, please feel
free to reach out to me through LinkedIn.

158
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:05,415
Thank you.

159
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,530
Bye-bye.
