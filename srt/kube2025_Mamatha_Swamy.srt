00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,039
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:06,199
Welcome to the session on cloud
native hyper automation that's

3
00:00:06,199 --> 00:00:09,780
transforming compliance and risk
management in financial services.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,190
I'm Ma Swami.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,309
I work as an architect
at Microsoft Corporation.

6
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,174
And I have worked with
financial services industries.

7
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:18,969
For several years now.

8
00:00:19,659 --> 00:00:23,859
In this presentation, we will explore
how hyper automation powered by

9
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:29,139
AI and Kubernetes is fundamentally
transforming compliance and risk

10
00:00:29,139 --> 00:00:31,450
intelligence across financial systems.

11
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:37,300
The financial services industry
faces mounting pressure to process

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,095
exponentially growing transaction
volumes while maintaining

13
00:00:41,535 --> 00:00:44,080
rigorous compliance standards and.

14
00:00:44,995 --> 00:00:47,605
Mitigating the emerging
risks in real time.

15
00:00:48,535 --> 00:00:53,545
Traditional approaches to compliance and
risk management are no longer sufficient.

16
00:00:53,935 --> 00:00:59,695
We'll examine how cloud native
architecture enables scalable,

17
00:00:59,754 --> 00:01:03,205
resilient, and fully auditable workflows.

18
00:01:03,715 --> 00:01:07,555
We'll look at certain use cases
like know your customer, KYC,

19
00:01:07,555 --> 00:01:13,380
verification, fraud detection, and some
sophisticated credit risk modeling.

20
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,810
All of these use cases, as we will talk
further through the session, are supported

21
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:25,710
by machine learning models that can be
containerized, and we will talk about

22
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,940
how GI tops and certain methodologies
can help with these use cases.

23
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,990
Throughout this presentation,
I'll share key architecture,

24
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,950
design principles, implementation
strategies, real world lessons.

25
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,360
From having worked on building
adaptive regulation of your systems

26
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,550
that evolve seamlessly with rapidly
changing financial landscape.

27
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,270
Alright, let's dig in.

28
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,600
So the hyper motivation refers the
strategic convergence of artificial

29
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,140
intelligence, machine learning,
robotic process automation, and cloud

30
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,480
native technologies to transform.

31
00:02:01,975 --> 00:02:07,555
Manual error prone enterprise
operations into these intelligent

32
00:02:07,555 --> 00:02:09,355
self optimizing systems.

33
00:02:09,855 --> 00:02:15,825
The transformation enables financial
institutions to process thousands

34
00:02:15,855 --> 00:02:18,675
of compliance checks simultaneously.

35
00:02:19,175 --> 00:02:24,050
It can also adapt to changing
regulatory requirements and.

36
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:31,300
Be able to generate the re
required reports in a matter of

37
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,880
couple of hours instead of months.

38
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:39,110
It can also help in maintaining
consistent policy enforcement

39
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,640
across global operations.

40
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:47,255
The core technologies that power
hyper automation are machine learning.

41
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,770
Which has these deep learning models
for pattern recognition, anomaly

42
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:57,410
detection, predictive analytics,
deployed as containerized services.

43
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:04,610
Now, these models continuously learn from
transactional data, identifying subtle

44
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:10,370
patterns and credit risk indicators that
traditional rule-based systems cannot

45
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,910
detect natural language processing.

46
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,910
Provides these large natural
language processing supported

47
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,980
by these large language models.

48
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,020
Help with say document analysis,
regulatory, text interpretation,

49
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,130
and automated report.

50
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:30,980
Generation NLP systems extract
critical information from unstructured

51
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:36,680
regulatory documents and generate
compliant reports in multiple languages.

52
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:43,810
RPA, which has these intelligent bots
handle routine compliance tasks, do data

53
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,270
validation and regulatory submissions.

54
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,850
These RPA systems work 24 by seven,
processing thousands of transactions

55
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:57,070
with perfect consistency while
lots of freeing up human analyst

56
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,900
for complex decision making.

57
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,240
Computer vision on the other hand,
helps with document verification,

58
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,290
biometric authentication, and
visual fraud detection capabilities.

59
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:13,620
Kubernetes serves as this
foundational orchestration layer

60
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:18,820
for all of these technologies to
come together and support hyper.

61
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:25,740
Automation Kubernetes is able to do that
as it is able to consistently scale and

62
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:32,490
provide secure systems for every component
from machine learning and inference

63
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,560
engines to workflow automation bots.

64
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:40,710
We'll talk about the architecture details
a little more as we discuss the use cases.

65
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:41,989
It's modern.

66
00:04:42,424 --> 00:04:48,694
Financial institutions leverage Kubernetes
to orchestrate complex compliance

67
00:04:48,694 --> 00:04:55,054
workflows, which are distributed across
these microservice architectures, the

68
00:04:55,054 --> 00:05:00,905
containerized approach fundamentally
transforms how financial systems

69
00:05:00,905 --> 00:05:06,214
operate, enabling elastic scaling during
peak regulatory reporting periods.

70
00:05:06,635 --> 00:05:12,354
Seamless deployment and versioning of
machine learning models and fault tolerant

71
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:19,825
processing of hypersensitive financial
data that is geographically distributed.

72
00:05:20,325 --> 00:05:24,124
A critical Kubernetes features enable.

73
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,854
Truly adaptive systems.

74
00:05:26,974 --> 00:05:32,525
This horizontal pod autoscaling
dynamically adjusts the resources

75
00:05:32,554 --> 00:05:34,054
based on the transactional value.

76
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:39,604
The service mesh technology
provides zero trust security between

77
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:43,414
microservices and ops workflows to.

78
00:05:43,804 --> 00:05:49,294
That allows teams to deploy policy
changes across global infrastructure

79
00:05:49,324 --> 00:05:51,634
in minutes rather than weeks.

80
00:05:51,844 --> 00:05:57,484
But these capabilities all allow
financial institutions to build systems

81
00:05:57,484 --> 00:06:03,079
that respond dynamically to changes in
the regulatory requirements or market

82
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:09,049
conditions while maintaining unwavering
compliance and operational resilience.

83
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:15,340
This architecture fund provides the
foundation for truly cloud native

84
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:22,090
financial operations where infrastructure
adapts automatically to business

85
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:27,490
needs while maintaining rigorous
security and compliance standards.

86
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,724
Now let's look at a couple of use cases.

87
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:36,384
The first use case that I've got
here is how KYC can be transformed

88
00:06:36,474 --> 00:06:38,424
with multimodal authentication.

89
00:06:38,924 --> 00:06:44,205
The multimodal biometric verification
combines facial recognition, document

90
00:06:44,294 --> 00:06:49,405
authentication, and behavioral analysis
with containerized microservices.

91
00:06:50,234 --> 00:06:54,325
Computer vision algorithms
powered by computer vision

92
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:57,354
or open CV and tensor flow.

93
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:01,854
Validate identity documents while
machine learning models assign,

94
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,585
assess the risk profiles in real time.

95
00:07:05,085 --> 00:07:11,955
This approach uses biometric APIs
like say Azure face API for precise

96
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:17,744
identity matching, coupled with
behavioral analytic models that detect

97
00:07:17,744 --> 00:07:20,564
anomalies in user interaction patterns.

98
00:07:21,284 --> 00:07:27,765
Each verification T runs as independent
containerized microservice on Kubernetes,

99
00:07:28,265 --> 00:07:31,890
enabling truly parallel processing of.

100
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:34,520
Identity verification steps.

101
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,310
So when a user uploads the identity
document and a selfie, for example,

102
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:44,169
for this picture, Kubernetes
orchestrates simultaneous document

103
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:49,990
verification or validation, and the
facial matching with the behavioral

104
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,140
scrolling, delivering a comprehensive.

105
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,939
Confidence core for risk assessment
in seconds rather than hours.

106
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:04,390
That dramatically reduces the customer
onboarding friction while exceeding

107
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:06,159
regulatory compliance standards.

108
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:11,485
The other use case that we have is
streaming analytics for fraud detection.

109
00:08:11,934 --> 00:08:16,434
Now, real time fraud detection requires
processing millions of transactions per

110
00:08:16,434 --> 00:08:22,674
second while identifying subtle patterns
that indicate fraudulent activity.

111
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:26,085
Streaming analytics,
leverages even driven.

112
00:08:26,954 --> 00:08:33,134
Can, it's even driven architecture
and Kubernetes to create a resilient,

113
00:08:33,314 --> 00:08:36,014
scalable fraud prevention system.

114
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:42,614
This architecture can process transactions
with latency measured in milliseconds,

115
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:49,334
enabling institutions to block fraudulent
transactions before they complete,

116
00:08:49,724 --> 00:08:55,785
while minimizing false positives
that frustrate legitimate customers.

117
00:08:56,285 --> 00:09:02,344
So what I've represented on screen is
just four different steps and where that

118
00:09:02,344 --> 00:09:07,755
ingestion is being done by this event
driven architecture which are listening

119
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:14,185
to the signals and Kubernetes is leveraged
for the containerized implementations.

120
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:19,615
The models are helping detect the patterns
and alerts are the ones that help.

121
00:09:20,115 --> 00:09:23,535
Financial systems, financial
services organizations

122
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:26,505
detect and manage the frauds.

123
00:09:27,005 --> 00:09:32,475
Now, AI driven customer service
is another scenario, which you

124
00:09:32,475 --> 00:09:34,125
must all be very familiar with.

125
00:09:34,695 --> 00:09:37,485
Or at least anybody who has
tried contacting customer

126
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:38,895
service in the recent past.

127
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:44,405
So any powered customer service agents
deployed across Kubernetes clusters

128
00:09:44,405 --> 00:09:51,425
can provide consistent compliance
responses while dynamically adapting

129
00:09:51,965 --> 00:09:54,275
to the changing requirements.

130
00:09:54,605 --> 00:09:59,885
These agents leverage natural language
understanding to resolve complex

131
00:09:59,885 --> 00:10:05,225
financial queries without human
intervention, maintaining conversation

132
00:10:05,225 --> 00:10:07,925
context across multiple interactions.

133
00:10:08,425 --> 00:10:14,425
As an example, these can be built on
Azure OpenAI services and deployed

134
00:10:14,575 --> 00:10:17,065
through Azure Kubernetes service.

135
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:21,655
These virtual agents
understand customer intent.

136
00:10:22,615 --> 00:10:26,455
They can access account
information securely and provide

137
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,525
personalized financial guidance.

138
00:10:29,025 --> 00:10:32,415
All this can be done while
maintaining strict compliance with

139
00:10:32,415 --> 00:10:37,645
privacy and regulatory standards
in the financial services industry.

140
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:45,055
Alright, next one that we have here is
QAPs driven compliance automation, large

141
00:10:45,055 --> 00:10:47,905
language model based compliance pipelines.

142
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:54,640
Deployed through GitHub's workflows
ensure consistent, auditable regulatory

143
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,850
processes across all of the environments.

144
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:03,450
Essentially, infrastructure as a
code principle can extend beyond

145
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:08,545
the traditional DevOps to compliance
rules themselves, enabling version

146
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:13,795
controlled regulatory logic, and
fully automated policy updates.

147
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:19,375
Today most financial and
regulatory enterprises struggle

148
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:25,165
with fragmented manual compliance
processes that creates significant

149
00:11:25,165 --> 00:11:27,815
operational land operational risk.

150
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:32,625
And these compliance rules are
often managed in spreadsheets,

151
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,115
word documents, and siloed systems.

152
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,960
Making it nearly impossible
to ensure version control,

153
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,340
consistency, or even traceability
across streams and geographies.

154
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,790
So in the traditional systems.

155
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:55,300
When regulatory frameworks change,
updates to policies or workflows are

156
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:00,940
applied manually by different teams
leading to implementation deals that are

157
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,850
measured in typically months to years.

158
00:12:04,195 --> 00:12:09,770
Human errors in policy interpretation
and dangerous gaps in audit

159
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,650
coverage are not uncommon.

160
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:13,910
These.

161
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:20,930
There's also extremely limited visibility
for the compliance teams that they're

162
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:26,300
unable to easily verify whether the
applied systems are fully aligned and the

163
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,420
reg with the latest regulatory standards.

164
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,030
Now, that's where GitHubs can help.

165
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,210
It can.

166
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:40,320
Draft dramatically reduce the operational
risk because everything is traceable

167
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:47,540
and auditable With compliance updates
deployed in hours instead of weeks, it

168
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:54,050
can completely eliminate the drift between
environments and automated validation

169
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,130
that all of the systems comply with the.

170
00:12:58,715 --> 00:13:04,205
Current regulations, it simplifies
certification of the systems within

171
00:13:04,205 --> 00:13:05,975
the financial services industry.

172
00:13:06,475 --> 00:13:08,525
Credit risk sorry about the typo.

173
00:13:08,525 --> 00:13:12,980
It's not revolution, but evolution
mission learning algorithms.

174
00:13:13,915 --> 00:13:19,555
Analyze vast data sets include including
comprehensive transaction history,

175
00:13:19,555 --> 00:13:26,465
behavioral spending patterns credit bureau
data and external risk factors to generate

176
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:32,525
sophisticated, multi-dimensional credit
scores that far exceed the predictive

177
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:35,320
power of traditional FIO based models.

178
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:42,960
Containerized model serving architecture
enables sophisticated AB testing of

179
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:48,180
risk models in production environments
that allows continuous improvement

180
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,405
of credit positioning, accuracy.

181
00:13:51,905 --> 00:13:53,135
Models are deployed.

182
00:13:53,195 --> 00:13:58,445
Models can be deployed as independent
microservices, enabling real time

183
00:13:58,445 --> 00:14:03,305
scoring of loan applications while
maintaining strict regulatory compliance

184
00:14:03,305 --> 00:14:05,345
and extensibility requirements.

185
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:11,685
Advanced techniques like gradient
boosting natural neural networks and

186
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:17,475
ensemble methods identify complex
linear relationships in credit data.

187
00:14:17,975 --> 00:14:23,415
They can improve default default
predict prediction accuracy.

188
00:14:24,105 --> 00:14:29,935
Now one thing to bear in mind when
thinking about credit risk evaluation

189
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:35,435
using these technologies is the
potential bias in these models

190
00:14:36,095 --> 00:14:38,975
it's a significant challenge that.

191
00:14:39,475 --> 00:14:46,315
Models may unintentionally favor or
disadvantage a loan applicant based on

192
00:14:46,315 --> 00:14:51,175
the factors that are correlated with
protected characteristics such as gender,

193
00:14:51,175 --> 00:14:53,905
race, geography, socioeconomic status.

194
00:14:53,905 --> 00:15:00,235
For example, this often occurs when
the training data reflects historical

195
00:15:00,235 --> 00:15:05,995
lending patterns that embody the past
discrimination rather than objective

196
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:08,335
financial behavior or creditworthiness.

197
00:15:08,835 --> 00:15:17,575
This comprehensive approach of detecting
a bias, having explainable ai, knowing

198
00:15:17,695 --> 00:15:22,405
which models are used and being cognizant
of the models that are being selected,

199
00:15:22,405 --> 00:15:29,625
and continuous monitoring of what these
models are resulting or showing the

200
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:34,095
results will help in reducing the bias.

201
00:15:34,595 --> 00:15:40,625
Reducing the bias is essentially
important to ensure fairness while

202
00:15:41,195 --> 00:15:45,515
also ensuring that you are able
to assess the risk accurately.

203
00:15:45,935 --> 00:15:53,225
It is also important to be able to
explain how a risk is determined to

204
00:15:53,225 --> 00:15:58,325
be compliant with regulations and
ensure transparency and accountability.

205
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:03,005
Looking at some of the implementation
strategy and best practices.

206
00:16:03,575 --> 00:16:10,075
Firstly I would suggest looking at high
impact use cases, these high impact use

207
00:16:10,075 --> 00:16:14,775
cases, for example, say KYC verification,
which is which is very much required in

208
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:20,895
financial services industry, but it's also
one of the critical processes that impact.

209
00:16:21,675 --> 00:16:25,455
The customer of the financial
services industry in addition to

210
00:16:25,455 --> 00:16:27,195
the operations teams internally.

211
00:16:27,765 --> 00:16:33,075
So essentially, these high impact
use cases will help showcase a return

212
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:38,965
on investment that will that'll
help the firm adopt these, latest

213
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:42,835
technologies that can help them
become one of these frontier firms.

214
00:16:43,465 --> 00:16:49,945
The second best practice is to firstly
build the cloud native foundation

215
00:16:49,945 --> 00:16:54,345
that is required to support these
forward looking technologies.

216
00:16:54,985 --> 00:16:59,465
Kubernetes infrastructure, for example
with proper security controls and

217
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:02,125
monitoring and alerting can can help.

218
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:06,135
We saw all of these core technologies
that power hyper automation.

219
00:17:06,635 --> 00:17:11,615
The third one is to make sure
these changes are gradual and

220
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,295
not happening all at once.

221
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:18,825
Using cannery deployments, which is
essentially some, a type of blue-green

222
00:17:18,825 --> 00:17:25,270
deployment to reduce their risk involved
in, in rolling out these technologies or

223
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:31,510
also consider using AB testing framework
to validate what these machine learning

224
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:36,620
models are how these machine learning
models are performing in production and

225
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,360
how you could reduce risk if required.

226
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:47,230
The last one I have on screen is to
ensure that there is regulatory alignment.

227
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:51,740
This is most important, as you all know,
within financial services industry.

228
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,470
All of the systems that are used.

229
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:02,540
It is highly recommended to maintain
comprehensive audit trails and ensure

230
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:08,740
that there is explainable AI capability
and automated compliance validation

231
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,410
built directly into the architecture.

232
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:15,700
So these considerations should
be taken right at the beginning

233
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,700
of your implementations, right
when you're designing the

234
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,425
system, not as an afterthought.

235
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:25,575
And successfully implementing hyper
automation requires these strategic

236
00:18:25,575 --> 00:18:30,985
phased approaches that balances
innovation and operational stability

237
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:33,385
alongside the regulatory compliance.

238
00:18:33,885 --> 00:18:39,400
Continuing with some of these best
practices, technical risk mitigation

239
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,640
is, can be achieved using multi-region
deployment for your business continuity

240
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,290
and disaster recovery capabilities.

241
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:54,830
And monitor your models and retrain the
pipelines to maintain model accuracy,

242
00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:00,920
ensure that are circuit breakers built
in to have fail safe mechanisms for the

243
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,650
ML or machine learning service failures.

244
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:08,900
We've talked about reducing bias,
and that's a very important factor.

245
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:15,190
Compliance considerations, explainable
ai, privacy, preserving machine

246
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:19,500
learning, immutable audit logs
that cannot be altered essentially,

247
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,630
and data quality monitoring.

248
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,920
These are some of the factors that
we do wanna make sure are taken into

249
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,585
consideration, followed through the
implementation to ensure excellence.

250
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:35,045
They essentially create technically
robust and compliant system when you're

251
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:40,480
evolving in ensure the sustainability
of these hyper automation initiatives.

252
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,530
Wrapping up with the future
of hyper automated finance.

253
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:49,860
Finance hyper automation represents
a fundamental paradigm shift from

254
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:57,810
reactive manual compliance processes
to proactive, intelligent risk

255
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:04,720
systems By, and you achieve this like
we've talked about by strategically

256
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,980
combining the AI capabilities with
cloud native architecture patterns.

257
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:15,310
Financials institutions can build
truly adaptive systems that evolve

258
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:21,150
seamlessly with regulatory changes while
maintaining exceptional operational

259
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,520
efficiency and customer experience.

260
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:28,070
The convergence of machine learning,
containerization and automation

261
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:33,050
technologies creates unprecedented
opportunities for financial

262
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,330
innovation organizations that.

263
00:20:36,185 --> 00:20:40,265
Successfully implement these
comprehensive strategies will gain

264
00:20:40,265 --> 00:20:47,165
substantial competitive advantages
through dramatically reduced operational

265
00:20:47,165 --> 00:20:52,625
costs, significantly improved
customer experiences in enhanced

266
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:58,055
regulatory compliance posture, and
the ability to respond to market

267
00:20:58,055 --> 00:21:01,655
changes with speed and accuracy.

268
00:21:02,525 --> 00:21:03,310
And to wrap it up.

269
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:07,230
I would like to say that the
future belongs to institutions

270
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,790
that embrace transformation.

271
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:13,680
Building systems that are not
just automated, but are truly

272
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,590
intelligent and adaptive.

273
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,170
Thank you for your time.

274
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,750
I appreciate you
listening to this session.
