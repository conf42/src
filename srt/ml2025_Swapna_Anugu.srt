1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:01,980
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:03,330
I'm Sona.

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:10,200
I have working as a data solution
lead and a data scientist, so I would

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,120
like to discuss about a meets ml. How
the transforming financial decisions

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,110
by using neural network to what is
the financial decision intelligent

6
00:00:20,169 --> 00:00:22,870
as it is used for risk assessment.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,520
For example, credit scoring and fraud
detection and investment strategies.

8
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,339
Some algorithms are trend
tradings, et cetera.

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,884
And we can forecast market trends
and operational decisions, how

10
00:00:35,884 --> 00:00:37,594
the loan approvals can be given.

11
00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:42,870
So by incorporating this A ML
with the neural network, so it

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,699
fast the decisions and pattern
recognitions can be also happen.

13
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:51,550
And ha it handles noisy
and incomplete data.

14
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,469
And accurate predictions
in the real times.

15
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,939
So we will go into deeper the topic
how we have been implemented, and

16
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:02,680
what can be the chances of results.

17
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:04,180
About myself.

18
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,680
So as I mentioned, I have been working
as a data scientist and mostly in

19
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,530
the banking and finance two minds.

20
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,370
Whereas I had gone through multiple use
cases and the solutions given and which

21
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:21,729
is going very well, and live the projects
also has been happen with the solutions.

22
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:22,749
What proposed?

23
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,869
What is the role of a neural network?

24
00:01:25,929 --> 00:01:28,440
This neural network is it's a human brain.

25
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,019
It's this inspired with the neurons.

26
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:33,909
It thinks as like a human brain.

27
00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:35,479
These are the capabilities.

28
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:41,859
It can handle huge data sets, and it
captures non-linear relationships also.

29
00:01:42,429 --> 00:01:45,849
And definitely it's a real time
how the human brain can think about

30
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:47,439
realtime processing the same thing.

31
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:51,015
And there are some types
of neural networks.

32
00:01:51,015 --> 00:01:51,939
There's RN.

33
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:57,615
It's mostly, it's for time
series predictions and CNNs are

34
00:01:58,575 --> 00:02:05,325
basically, it's for the chart
patterns and the transfer models.

35
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:10,755
It's both sequential and complex data
relationship and it handles internally

36
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,519
when we incorporated with these decisions.

37
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,065
So it'll take a neural network
into the considerations when

38
00:02:17,065 --> 00:02:18,534
we choose an option for it.

39
00:02:19,494 --> 00:02:20,815
And I would like to talk.

40
00:02:21,805 --> 00:02:26,315
Talk about some of the transformations
the banking domain, how we, how

41
00:02:26,405 --> 00:02:28,595
it has been getting used of this.

42
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:32,885
For example, this aid
driven risk assessment.

43
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:37,145
So how this past processing
the data and how it has been

44
00:02:37,145 --> 00:02:39,125
banks and financial companies.

45
00:02:39,215 --> 00:02:44,585
Uua, aI to scan through
huge amounts of data, right?

46
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:50,285
So it's internally how the data is
instantly the spots they can identify

47
00:02:50,585 --> 00:02:52,445
how the customers can be defaulted.

48
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:57,605
So these kind of risk assessment can
be detectable and anomaly detection.

49
00:02:57,935 --> 00:03:01,715
That is something which we can
easily identify what is the false I.

50
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:03,305
Alarms.

51
00:03:03,635 --> 00:03:08,165
And though it is showing as a good,
but there might be internal is some

52
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:13,965
algorithms which will trigger yeah, the
positive positivity of anomaly detections.

53
00:03:14,565 --> 00:03:19,345
So investment strategies also AI
can trend and learn from the past

54
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:23,605
rates and consistently improve the
strategies like, trial and error.

55
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:24,655
It is nothing.

56
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:29,395
But this helps investors and financial
firms make better decisions about

57
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:34,775
the data and when they invest money
sometimes even pitching human traders.

58
00:03:35,475 --> 00:03:39,065
Executive intelligence is
strategic decision cycles.

59
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:43,170
This helps company leaders make
smarter decisions fast and faster.

60
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,660
This AI can predict trends, market
changes and customer behaviors.

61
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,880
And so executive don't need to
wait till weeks for analysis.

62
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,399
They can act with the real
time data and for intelligence.

63
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:05,089
So these are the major transformations
we can consider in the bank.

64
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:08,635
And the risk assessment engines.

65
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:14,784
So if we go for this pyramid, so if I go
for the real data time processing, this

66
00:04:14,784 --> 00:04:20,324
is considered structured and unstructured
structured can be defined is a better way

67
00:04:20,324 --> 00:04:22,694
since it is A-T-P-M-S and very structured.

68
00:04:23,024 --> 00:04:25,994
So those can be handled, but the
unstructured and semi-structured

69
00:04:25,994 --> 00:04:27,405
data is quite challenging.

70
00:04:27,824 --> 00:04:31,274
We, with the standalone
systems, it's hard to do this.

71
00:04:31,634 --> 00:04:37,824
With this cloud and AI solutions it
goes with the smooth processing and AI

72
00:04:37,824 --> 00:04:43,455
created transfer learnings is something,
whatever the knowledge it is take

73
00:04:43,455 --> 00:04:48,405
what if, what it learned from the one
area and it applies to another area.

74
00:04:48,795 --> 00:04:54,844
If, for example somewhere the products
happened and it mentioned this kind of

75
00:04:54,965 --> 00:05:02,125
scenarios is happening, so you may get a.
Chances of this default, so that kind of

76
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:07,955
previous it have a repository in that and
it'll come into the f in other location.

77
00:05:08,005 --> 00:05:10,195
It happened the same type of scenario.

78
00:05:10,195 --> 00:05:13,975
It mentioned that, okay, if this
is leading to your situation also.

79
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:18,475
So this kind of guided transfer
learnings also can be happened and

80
00:05:18,475 --> 00:05:20,565
advanced prediction capabilities.

81
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,260
If you go for the system doesn't
just detect what's happening, then

82
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,110
now it predicts the later dates,
how it can be happen, and what is

83
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,460
the solutions for it, these extra
futures it predicts and give it help.

84
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,175
So in summary, this handles any kind of.

85
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,060
And it's learned from different
domains, not only from single bank

86
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,030
domain, but it consider all the domains
and this predict future problems

87
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,490
and keep improving over the time.

88
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:58,290
It's not a one time results and there
are some components in a ML risk.

89
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:03,310
So dynamic risk scoring is
something we can update risk

90
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,760
profiles that adapt some threats.

91
00:06:06,135 --> 00:06:10,425
For example, this means that the AI
systems keep updating a person's or

92
00:06:10,425 --> 00:06:13,065
company risk level as new data comes in.

93
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:18,235
So it, doesn't just use the
whole credit scores or reports.

94
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:19,975
It constantly check new patterns.

95
00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:21,195
And it applies.

96
00:06:21,585 --> 00:06:25,975
So for example, if a customer
who suddenly starts spending a

97
00:06:25,975 --> 00:06:31,145
lot of more money and few payment
might be flagged as a higher risk.

98
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:36,645
So that brings to the situation and
scenario simulations is this where

99
00:06:36,905 --> 00:06:42,405
the system imagine many what if the
situations to see how bad things

100
00:06:42,405 --> 00:06:47,955
could happen, and it tells banks to
plan and advance more safety measure.

101
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:53,175
So the AI simulated stock market
crash, for example, are rising interest

102
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:55,635
rates are major economic slowdown.

103
00:06:56,775 --> 00:07:00,395
F then checks the bank's
investment would perform each case.

104
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:06,085
I'll pick the bank plan and smarter
strategies also and explainable outputs.

105
00:07:06,085 --> 00:07:09,235
Sir, this is not something,
the black box, it happens.

106
00:07:09,325 --> 00:07:10,945
It's giving the results.

107
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:14,055
No, it takes explain the
detailed information.

108
00:07:14,295 --> 00:07:17,835
For example, if the customer
is denied for a low, then it

109
00:07:17,835 --> 00:07:19,785
mention why it has been denied.

110
00:07:20,185 --> 00:07:21,804
This income is low.

111
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:27,470
Or it's too many recent credit inquiries
are late payment for the past six months.

112
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,655
All these kind of situations, it
explain so that it's a justification.

113
00:07:33,465 --> 00:07:37,955
And if I take one of the examples, this
is the anomaly detection framework.

114
00:07:38,284 --> 00:07:43,425
So what here I can mention that
there are behavioral biometrics.

115
00:07:43,425 --> 00:07:48,075
So behavioral biometrics is something
AI watch how people interact with

116
00:07:48,075 --> 00:07:50,115
other they devices and confirm.

117
00:07:50,685 --> 00:07:57,535
So if it is accessing if you are usually,
ask the question or type quickly, but

118
00:07:57,535 --> 00:08:01,995
somewhere you just became very slow
or else some, sometimes you are making

119
00:08:02,145 --> 00:08:07,965
urgency of something so it identify
this behaviorals and if some, someone.

120
00:08:08,545 --> 00:08:09,475
You are intense.

121
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:13,665
Something hit the phone shake and when
you are talking, so these kind of also

122
00:08:13,665 --> 00:08:18,375
its aspect and transactional stress is
something as looking for the pattern.

123
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:19,675
How usually.

124
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,180
Spending the behavior.

125
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:27,270
We can say that if you usually show
up in your city at one local store,

126
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:31,650
suddenly you started spending high
amount and uneven times and all.

127
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,520
So then it identifies and triggers
that, okay this is something is

128
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,580
unusual and cross channel activities.

129
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,830
So it's a tracking behavioral.

130
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:47,170
Come across the behavior states, same
across phone, apps, website, and devices.

131
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,470
If you log from multiple devices
from one geographical location,

132
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,190
for example, us from different
locations, different states at a time.

133
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,710
So then it suspects why
this has been happening.

134
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:03,070
So something is efficient
and network analysis.

135
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,740
Also, it can be done, it finds
the multiple accounts are

136
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,810
making a similar purchase.

137
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,070
Transferring money to the same group.

138
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,820
This might be a fraud ring.

139
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,480
If two unrelated customers suddenly
send money back and forth multiple

140
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,670
times, it might be many hundred, right?

141
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:24,890
So these kind of things it's identified
basically in anomaly detections.

142
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:29,605
It's catch pro early stage
and reduce false alert.

143
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:33,695
And protect users without
slowing down the transactions.

144
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:37,905
AI announced investment
strategies is the sum thing.

145
00:09:38,235 --> 00:09:40,685
It's a real reinforcement learning.

146
00:09:41,015 --> 00:09:42,305
Reinforcement learning.

147
00:09:42,305 --> 00:09:43,715
That's the optimal solutions.

148
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:45,425
That strategies, it keeps learning.

149
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:50,555
It's keep learning and explain
very well for us, which is the

150
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:54,575
better solutions and where it can
be, go for it in a better plan.

151
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,765
And it learns from the previous models.

152
00:09:57,825 --> 00:10:01,245
It's keep learning and it's a mature.

153
00:10:02,595 --> 00:10:06,435
That time and NLP sentiment
analysis, it's a text processing,

154
00:10:06,435 --> 00:10:08,355
how you type in the text.

155
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:14,045
And is there any common type of words
or this, which is giving sensing for

156
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:15,985
something else, pro or something.

157
00:10:15,985 --> 00:10:20,905
So just it'll give a sense of from this,
your text, whatever you are typing.

158
00:10:21,295 --> 00:10:22,405
So personalized pro.

159
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,640
Portfolios truly that in whatever
the investment recommendations are

160
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,170
aligned, this any tolerances are
there, or any financial objects

161
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,060
behind this model portfolio.

162
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,550
This reinforce investment
strategies and this algorithm that

163
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,940
continuously learn from the market
condition and transactions outcome.

164
00:10:44,615 --> 00:10:49,175
So by combining all this machine
learning with the human achievements

165
00:10:49,175 --> 00:10:54,865
and these all deliver the sophisticated
strategies and continuously available,

166
00:10:54,865 --> 00:11:00,605
only the investment investors are
net worth individuals and which is

167
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:06,815
they can get benefit out of this
and performance during market, is

168
00:11:06,815 --> 00:11:12,305
something from the past three years, the
performance has drastically increased.

169
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,440
Now every of the financial companies
moving from traditional approach

170
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,850
to the strategies because instead
of spending a lot of time for

171
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:26,045
this analysis, data fetching and
individual vendors dealing all these.

172
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:30,785
Making them for long time processing
and the, they have to wait for

173
00:11:30,785 --> 00:11:32,165
the results for long time too.

174
00:11:32,545 --> 00:11:38,395
So now whoever is opting this one, 32%
is increased from the three years to

175
00:11:38,635 --> 00:11:41,285
expecting more in the upcoming years.

176
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:44,795
And past performance is
something that's a response.

177
00:11:44,795 --> 00:11:49,715
Time is market shift is a is
a fast because every banking

178
00:11:49,715 --> 00:11:51,245
transactions are everything.

179
00:11:51,485 --> 00:11:54,515
So they wanted to make a
decision very quick and at the

180
00:11:54,605 --> 00:11:56,985
same time it has to be updated.

181
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:04,120
So that response and eventually the
client retentions will be good because

182
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,350
if they are satisfied with the service
and it's leading to their solutions, then

183
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,060
definitely the retentions will be high.

184
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,475
So that is what the 65
to 70% aspect research.

185
00:12:17,075 --> 00:12:22,115
Execute this intelligent platforms
is give a predictive analytics

186
00:12:22,145 --> 00:12:26,765
if forecast, what is the business
outcome and how it can be happened.

187
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:31,385
So it predicts and give the solutions
and scenario planning is something.

188
00:12:31,845 --> 00:12:37,075
That you can plan for whether this
kind of scenario it fits, and how this

189
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:42,545
modeling which future can be used for
this to execute into the real time and

190
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:46,175
decision support is something, what
are the strategies which you can take?

191
00:12:46,435 --> 00:12:47,215
Place a fit.

192
00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:49,705
And every use case is different.

193
00:12:49,795 --> 00:12:54,185
And it with respect to the
financial domains and that use

194
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:55,775
cases, they need to go for it.

195
00:12:55,775 --> 00:13:00,305
And they can take decisions And
performance tracking is something that

196
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,850
they will have a measurable outcomes.

197
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:09,130
It's, we can see it rapid performance
implement by excluding this process

198
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,935
and this predictive analysis.

199
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:18,390
Analytics also giving a better decision
in the organization levels if you

200
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,190
wanted to implement this framework.

201
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,660
So first we need to identify the
use case, whether it belongs to our

202
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,520
organization or our financial, or
especially the use case which we

203
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,245
are planning because every problem
statement will not fit into the A ML.

204
00:13:34,755 --> 00:13:38,325
So first we need to under
understand what is the purpose of.

205
00:13:38,695 --> 00:13:41,005
To move this a ML and your network.

206
00:13:41,005 --> 00:13:45,385
So why it has been Because
that we need to identify first.

207
00:13:45,775 --> 00:13:48,625
Then after that, the in
infrastructure preparation.

208
00:13:48,955 --> 00:13:54,985
So whether you wanted to go for cloud, if
cloud what, what else is a Google cloud?

209
00:13:55,345 --> 00:13:59,965
And AWS says you, which platform you
wanted to choose it, that you can decide.

210
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,105
And most of the things.

211
00:14:01,645 --> 00:14:06,790
The A ML all these services are matched
with the cloud platform, so we need

212
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:11,110
not to go first separately, so they,
we will have one bundle and deployment

213
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,850
strategies also very quick with us.

214
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:20,170
And pilot deployment as take samples to
and flow, you can develop with some sample

215
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,920
set of data and you can see the results.

216
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:29,440
If you satisfied with the small case
use cases, then that pilot project can

217
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,320
be deployed and monitored for some.

218
00:14:31,345 --> 00:14:31,675
Time.

219
00:14:32,155 --> 00:14:35,725
It is not something just we have
deployed and cannot go for it.

220
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:40,760
I just will monitor it and observe whether
the patents are tallying and the expected

221
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,460
outcomes are reaching out and scaled.

222
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,390
Implementation.

223
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,820
You can go for once it is the
pilots across successful and you can

224
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,660
follow the governance and monitoring
and treating affected approaches.

225
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,425
And then the, we can implement
the approaches in the best way.

226
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:02,510
So the most effective deployments
is is a dual focus on technology and

227
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,340
people and organization adoption.

228
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,660
The skill management development is also
required, and we need to have a clear

229
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,370
communication of bandwidth or what exactly
we are going to get of this technologies.

230
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,240
I would like to call out some
key takeaways from this session.

231
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,430
Say, hybrid is a superior.

232
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,120
Definitely.

233
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,730
We cannot just simply go
with the one one adoption.

234
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,960
We can combine AA and ML techniques
and neural networks in between.

235
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,640
Then underlying one single approach
just to, we develop one kind of model

236
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,490
so that will not give better results.

237
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,410
And even we cannot depend on one.

238
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,400
One application and you can have it.

239
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:50,350
Start with good data good data in the
sense we will, we have more noisy data

240
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,190
and identify what are the quality of
data and what are the parameters can be

241
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:00,900
used to take the decisions and whether
it is it passing the governance policies,

242
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:06,205
for example, this SSN and all we cannot
use directly the masking policies and

243
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:11,275
all will be in place and then we can
go for it and invest meant for this.

244
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:15,965
Data infrastructure before we are
passing the inputs to the model.

245
00:16:16,715 --> 00:16:20,765
And Human Plus mission partnership
is an important definitely one.

246
00:16:20,865 --> 00:16:24,855
Mission cannot implement and directly
go for all the decisions all the time.

247
00:16:24,855 --> 00:16:26,415
The women intervention is required.

248
00:16:26,895 --> 00:16:32,085
We need to pass it judgment so that
it'll learn it from there and give the

249
00:16:32,085 --> 00:16:34,845
solutions and measure continuously.

250
00:16:34,985 --> 00:16:38,255
It's not something just
implemented and done so.

251
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:41,675
No, it's just you need
to go for all the time.

252
00:16:41,715 --> 00:16:45,645
How the regularly it's a ized
feeding and regular patterns.

253
00:16:45,645 --> 00:16:47,055
Also, we need to feed it.

254
00:16:47,395 --> 00:16:52,570
And complexity scenarios also
will have to measure continuously.

255
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,110
So this financial institution
successfully implemented this

256
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:02,860
combinations, and they got an advantage
of this operational efficiency

257
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,020
and risk management capabilities.

258
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,450
To begin with this a ML journey.

259
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:14,330
Understand the requirement as
capability assessments and high

260
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:19,340
value use cases, and create a roadmap
and infrastructure and go for it.

261
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:19,970
Success.

262
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,750
Thank you for giving this opportunity.

263
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:29,370
Yeah, we, I would like to mention if
any of your use cases or solutions is to

264
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,770
be addressed, feel free to contact me.

265
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:32,790
Thank you.
