1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:01,410
Hey.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:01,800
Hi.

3
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,730
Good morning everyone.

4
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,019
This is Krishna Ula.

5
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,880
I'm excited to share about my recent
recently implemented a successful

6
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,690
Oracle migration to the Amazon Web
Services, which navigating to the future.

7
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,900
I'm here to explain little bit more
about like this migration is not

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,259
just about moving the data, but
about transferring your business

9
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:22,979
operations for the greater efficiency,
scalability, and agility in the cloud.

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,130
I'm happy to give you
more information on that.

11
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,470
And if in the economical and technical
transformation recently historically

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,780
on databases, infrastructure was.

13
00:00:34,515 --> 00:00:39,865
Capital initiative and required
significant in investment in hardware.

14
00:00:39,895 --> 00:00:45,475
And it s organizations were often
beyond by complex maintenance

15
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:47,535
schedule and regular hardware upgrade.

16
00:00:48,285 --> 00:00:51,885
Now the cloud has completely
transformed this module with

17
00:00:51,975 --> 00:00:54,105
AWS and other cloud platforms.

18
00:00:54,285 --> 00:00:59,985
You can, scalability, flexibility,
optimization, cost, structure, AWS custom

19
00:01:00,035 --> 00:01:05,735
consumption based pricing, especially AWS
is providing consumption based pricing

20
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:11,645
means you can only pay for what you use,
making it highly cost efficient solution.

21
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:15,515
The cloud migration process
is not just about technology.

22
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,660
It's about enabling business
transformation by migrating to the cloud

23
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:27,590
business can unlock your level of agility,
accelerate innovation, and gain in a

24
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:32,300
significant competitive a advantage.

25
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,885
Here we, if we like in, in, in the next
slide for the pre-migration assessment.

26
00:01:38,785 --> 00:01:45,845
A a comprehensive approach is a successful
migration beyond these two pre-migration.

27
00:01:46,025 --> 00:01:47,225
Pre-migration assessment.

28
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:52,865
Let explain the three main concepts, which
is strategic workload, performance and

29
00:01:52,985 --> 00:02:00,345
analysis, and de dependency mapping and
the migration read reading evaluation.

30
00:02:01,215 --> 00:02:06,645
For the strategic, for the s workload
performance analysis over 62 of enterprise

31
00:02:06,705 --> 00:02:12,285
enterprise report difficulties due to
the data complexity during migration, by

32
00:02:12,285 --> 00:02:19,435
analyzing your existing workload existing
workload, looking at computational

33
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:25,255
requirement, data integration and system
capabilities, you will gain valuable.

34
00:02:25,615 --> 00:02:30,235
Sites into the potential migration
challenges, dependency, migration,

35
00:02:30,235 --> 00:02:34,745
many migration falls failures steam
for insufficient understanding

36
00:02:34,745 --> 00:02:37,115
of system interdependencies.

37
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:43,175
And 47% of the organization experiences
failures due to this gap under.

38
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:49,395
Understanding how different system in
interacts allows as a better plan, the

39
00:02:49,484 --> 00:02:53,835
better plan the migration and avoid the
disruptions, the migration readiness

40
00:02:53,835 --> 00:03:00,785
evaluation here in this, organizations
with s pre, pre, pre-migration

41
00:03:00,785 --> 00:03:05,795
assessment for three to five more
likely to achieve successful migration.

42
00:03:05,795 --> 00:03:08,495
We need to at least three
to five iteration to perform

43
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:10,175
these successful migration.

44
00:03:10,385 --> 00:03:15,605
The most throughput, the preparation, the
smoother the migration process would be

45
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,725
for the next slide.

46
00:03:18,905 --> 00:03:20,285
Here one second.

47
00:03:20,885 --> 00:03:21,365
Yeah.

48
00:03:22,355 --> 00:03:25,555
These are one, yeah, these
AWS hosting options for the

49
00:03:25,555 --> 00:03:28,075
Oracle Micro Oracle databases.

50
00:03:28,345 --> 00:03:33,945
When the migration Oracle databases
to AWS we have two primary options,

51
00:03:34,275 --> 00:03:38,775
which is manage database solutions,
self-management database solutions.

52
00:03:38,954 --> 00:03:46,365
For example, Amazon, EC2, manage
database services like a Amazon RDS.

53
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,310
Are the go-to solutions for the most
organizations offering a fully managed

54
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:57,919
environment by moving to the A-S-R-D-R-D-S
68% of the enterprise reports, reducing

55
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:01,699
operational complexity and database
maintenance who are heading by.

56
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,459
Up to up to 45%.

57
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,019
The RDS automations we
administrator to task, including

58
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:11,480
backups, patching, and scalable.

59
00:04:11,529 --> 00:04:16,029
Scaling allows your team to focus on
innovating rather than maintenance,

60
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:19,959
like patching, upgrades and everything
for the self-manager databases

61
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,319
like EC2 for the enterprise.

62
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:25,979
Which specific complex
requirements, customs, database

63
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,819
solutions deployed on EC2.

64
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,809
Maybe more suitable.

65
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:36,239
These options allow you to fine tuning
the configuration, including using the

66
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:40,439
Bring your Own license model, where
you need to get your own license model,

67
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:42,869
which offers a greater flexibility.

68
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:46,859
Essentially if you all
already have Oracle licensing.

69
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:50,899
Here for the network and security
configuration we have like

70
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:54,079
for these security and network
configurations are critical

71
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:56,719
aspects of any migration nowadays.

72
00:04:56,969 --> 00:05:01,319
The comprehensive security
framework, enterprise connectivity,

73
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:06,299
architecture, BPC, infrastructure
Design, cloud Secure Foundation.

74
00:05:07,244 --> 00:05:11,494
Foundation if we go to the comprehensive
security framework implements

75
00:05:11,534 --> 00:05:18,354
encryptions or encryption at rest and
in transit, access control policies and

76
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:23,814
continuous monitoring and essentials
to secure the data for the enterprise

77
00:05:23,814 --> 00:05:31,354
connectivity architecture using the AWS
Direct Connect for the data dedicated.

78
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:36,019
Private connections to the AWS
provides both performance and

79
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:37,909
security for adding security.

80
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:41,269
VPN tunnels can be used for
encryption communication.

81
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:43,159
VPC infrastructure design.

82
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:47,814
VVPC means virtual private clouds
allows you to create isolation.

83
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:48,294
Network.

84
00:05:49,044 --> 00:05:54,924
Network environments by essentially
provides subnets and security groups.

85
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,804
We gained gradually control over.

86
00:05:58,404 --> 00:06:03,504
Or who can allows your data, allows your
database that resource connect to it.

87
00:06:04,374 --> 00:06:08,694
Cloud Security Foundation addressing
Oracle specific security challenges.

88
00:06:08,964 --> 00:06:13,554
Security challenges, which is like
AWS provides NATO security cha

89
00:06:13,924 --> 00:06:16,714
mechanism to address Oracle specific.

90
00:06:16,814 --> 00:06:21,664
Concerns such as database level
encryption and access level control.

91
00:06:21,994 --> 00:06:27,584
These ensure that your data remains
protected through throughout

92
00:06:27,584 --> 00:06:29,164
its journey in the cloud.

93
00:06:31,894 --> 00:06:35,274
Let's go to the next slide here,
the database migration strategies.

94
00:06:35,524 --> 00:06:38,194
There are four key
strategies in this migration.

95
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:38,644
There.

96
00:06:38,644 --> 00:06:40,394
These are assessment.

97
00:06:40,874 --> 00:06:44,834
Preparation, migration
validation in assessment.

98
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:48,654
Map, map out your current database
architecture, identify dependency

99
00:06:48,654 --> 00:06:52,644
and access the potential risk
of your mi potential risk of

100
00:06:52,644 --> 00:06:55,104
migration to AWS preparation.

101
00:06:55,404 --> 00:07:01,824
Align the migration plan with organization
objectives and establish a clear path.

102
00:07:02,034 --> 00:07:08,244
This strategy is about setting up the
groundwork for the actual migration.

103
00:07:10,914 --> 00:07:15,354
If you go to the migration, use AWS
database migration services to perform

104
00:07:15,684 --> 00:07:17,784
the data with minimal downtime.

105
00:07:18,384 --> 00:07:22,614
These services is ensure that your
database migration is both effect

106
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:24,669
efficient and cost effective.

107
00:07:25,564 --> 00:07:27,514
Validation once a migration is completed.

108
00:07:27,574 --> 00:07:30,604
Validate the data integration
performance, and functionality

109
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:32,164
in the cloud environment.

110
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:36,354
Ensure that everything works
as expected in crucial for

111
00:07:36,354 --> 00:07:38,034
the for a smooth transaction

112
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:41,194
in the migration technique.

113
00:07:41,554 --> 00:07:46,304
News the migrations are not always
simple, and understanding the

114
00:07:46,304 --> 00:07:48,284
right technique is essential.

115
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:50,129
Homogeneous migration.

116
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:52,649
There are like three, three types here.

117
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:56,489
Homogeneous migration, heterogeneous
migration, and hybrid migration.

118
00:07:56,489 --> 00:08:00,234
Homogeneous migration is, which
we usually do, Oracle to Oracle

119
00:08:00,554 --> 00:08:02,594
SQL to SQL Al Progressor port.

120
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:05,249
That's how it works for
the homogeneous migration.

121
00:08:05,549 --> 00:08:09,144
This is where radio you migrate
migration between similar

122
00:08:09,144 --> 00:08:11,184
databases like Oracle to Oracle.

123
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,919
It it's the comp it's the least
complex and as it's minimal co

124
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:23,579
compatibility issues and risk
reduces the risk reduce process here.

125
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,259
Heterogeneous migration.

126
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:29,999
These heterogeneous migration is diff is
different database platforms like Oracle

127
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:34,379
to MySQL or SQL or Oracle to Mongo.

128
00:08:35,369 --> 00:08:37,470
These are called hydrogenous migration.

129
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,389
It requires schema conversion.

130
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:43,739
Before we start any process, we need
to convert schema and create the same

131
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:48,689
schema in the conversion we in the target
database, like in MySQL from Oracle two.

132
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,229
Then the data transformation, but
offer the opt opportunity to modernize

133
00:08:54,229 --> 00:08:55,939
your database infrastructure.

134
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,429
In hybrid migration.

135
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:05,254
In hybrid migration in a way, in a phase
approach that combine both homogeneous

136
00:09:05,524 --> 00:09:07,534
and heterogeneous migration techniques.

137
00:09:07,744 --> 00:09:13,984
This approach allows for incremental
implementation, reduce, reducing

138
00:09:14,164 --> 00:09:18,454
the risk, and improving the
overall flexibility of the process.

139
00:09:18,844 --> 00:09:22,894
So we always follow for the high
hybrid migration, which is it

140
00:09:22,894 --> 00:09:24,244
has to be an incremental way.

141
00:09:25,244 --> 00:09:30,194
For the post migration optimization
which is management efficiency, security

142
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:36,324
efficiency or risk mitigation in the
management efficiency improves the, in

143
00:09:36,324 --> 00:09:41,844
database management efficiency through the
manager solution by 45%, security is 50.

144
00:09:43,024 --> 00:09:47,104
Reduction will be 55% reduction in
potential security vulnerabilities through

145
00:09:47,104 --> 00:09:52,804
advanced network isolation, 60% risk
mitigation potential data, ensuring the

146
00:09:52,804 --> 00:09:58,894
risk which mitigates through comprehensive
encryption strategies, which is data.

147
00:10:00,364 --> 00:10:05,344
Data exposure risks are significant,
reduces through encryption strategies

148
00:10:05,344 --> 00:10:09,814
and access the control mechanism
mitigates the risk by the 60%.

149
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:15,639
The same way the security enhancement
by utilizing AWS advanced network

150
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:22,029
capabilities indicates private subnets
and BPC com companies can reduce a

151
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:27,939
potential security vulnerabilities in
efficient improvement with the manager

152
00:10:27,939 --> 00:10:30,369
solutions like RDS operational tech.

153
00:10:30,729 --> 00:10:36,089
Typically see a 45% improvement in
the database management efficiency.

154
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:37,509
Yeah.

155
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:41,699
If we go to the cost optimization
strategies here we all think to

156
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:45,379
make a note of reduce ana reduce
analysis, continuous refine

157
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:48,139
refinement and performance monitoring,

158
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:54,629
excuse me, dynamic allocations
for the cost strategies.

159
00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:58,439
Cloud cost management
is continuous processes.

160
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:01,349
Here are the most
strategies to optimize your.

161
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,919
Cloud spending, reduce
analysis continuously.

162
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:10,349
Evaluate your resource to identify
underutilized accesses and

163
00:11:10,349 --> 00:11:14,759
areas where you can scale down
without impacting performance.

164
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:16,469
Dynamic allocation.

165
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:20,099
Use automated scale, automated scaling to.

166
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:25,569
I just resource between, I just
resource based on real time demand.

167
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:28,959
This ensures that you
only pay what you need.

168
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:30,939
Performance man.

169
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:34,869
Performance monitoring, track,
key performance metrics using

170
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:36,909
tools like Amazon Cloud was.

171
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:41,989
This enables you to identify bottlenecks
bottlenecks early and make just before

172
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:44,209
you, before they affected performance.

173
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:50,449
Continuous refining the cloud is
dynamic and so should be you should

174
00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:52,520
be your cost optimization approach.

175
00:11:52,849 --> 00:11:57,199
Regular assessment allows you
to make informed adjustments

176
00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:01,459
that maintain efficiently while
keeping cost under control.

177
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:07,719
And in the best practice for the
successful migration is to ensure

178
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:10,299
we follow several best process.

179
00:12:10,674 --> 00:12:13,434
First one is comprehensive
risk mitigation.

180
00:12:13,554 --> 00:12:19,214

plan to address, address, and divide

181
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:21,974
challenges that comes with my migration.

182
00:12:22,214 --> 00:12:29,024
The strategic migration plans thoroughly
plan your migration strategies, aligning

183
00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:35,894
it with business goals and expected
output outcomes, and testing validation.

184
00:12:36,434 --> 00:12:42,554
You use strategic environment to
simulate real world migration scenarios.

185
00:12:42,614 --> 00:12:46,514
Allows you to identify issues
before the migration occurs.

186
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,469
And do like multiple testings, like
we usually do, like from we started

187
00:12:52,469 --> 00:12:57,180
from Dell, UAT pre-prod and pro, so
we did multiple levels of testing

188
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:58,829
before we go to the production.

189
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:02,839
That's how we need to validate everything
is working from according to the business.

190
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:08,930
Need continuous monitoring, implement
robust monitoring tools to track the

191
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:12,920
performance for your system in real time.

192
00:13:13,295 --> 00:13:18,035
This allows you to detect the, and
detect and resolve issues early,

193

Teach management tools, changing
management tools are essential

205
00:14:13,775 --> 00:14:19,444
to minimize ception during the
transactions continuous improvement.

206

View the migration as an ongoing journey.

207
00:14:24,349 --> 00:14:29,510
Regular assessments for the performance
and emerging AWS compatibilities

208
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:35,599
will enco encourage new opportunities
for the arga optimization.
