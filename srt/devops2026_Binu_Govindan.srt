00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:01,650
Speaker 7: Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:05,379
Welcome to a Driven threat screening for
5G PF with automated risk mitigation.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,350
Let me introduce I, nu
principal, SDT at Microsoft.

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,230
Most of the folks working in
telecom world or cloud native

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,129
infrastructure have this in mind.

6
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:19,299
How do you actually secure
UPF or 5G network at scale?

7
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:23,519
So we we look at this problem from
an AI point of view how we can

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,604
actually, solve or prevent the attacks.

9
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:30,804
To A-A-U-P-F in in any kind
of, 24 bar seven operations.

10
00:00:31,704 --> 00:00:35,755
During the talk, if you disagree with me
in any of the topic, please feel free to

11
00:00:35,755 --> 00:00:39,574
contact me at my email bin k26@gmail.com.

12
00:00:39,815 --> 00:00:43,025
I'll be happy to answer
you your queries anytime.

13
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:46,245
And also, I have a disclaimer
here to make the presentation

14
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:49,855
slides information I share today
represent my own personal views.

15
00:00:49,995 --> 00:00:54,135
I'm speaking of myself and not behalf
of my employer, Microsoft Corporation.

16
00:00:54,635 --> 00:00:55,715
Okay, let us start.

17
00:00:55,745 --> 00:01:01,964
As 5G Network adoption is in increasing
largely across the world and most of

18
00:01:01,964 --> 00:01:05,125
the food 5G footprint is evolving.

19
00:01:05,545 --> 00:01:09,455
Along with that there is an
unprecedented attack also security

20
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:11,494
threats in these networks as well.

21
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:14,905
So it's very important to look
at and secure the networks.

22
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,335
What are the pro what are the gaps today?

23
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:19,404
So you have, some of the protocol gaps.

24
00:01:19,684 --> 00:01:21,009
The the protocol is complex.

25
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:24,460
There are some loopholes in
the, signaling and data plane.

26
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,970
So this can be exploited by the
attackers to get into the network.

27
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:31,619
And as 5G Network by and
large is virtualized.

28
00:01:31,889 --> 00:01:33,239
It's a service based architecture.

29
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:37,375
And along with the adoption
of the cloud and Kubernetes.

30
00:01:37,734 --> 00:01:41,465
There are there are other surface
areas that attackers can exploit.

31
00:01:41,965 --> 00:01:43,465
Slice misconfigurations.

32
00:01:43,525 --> 00:01:46,395
You actually look at some
of the slices configured.

33
00:01:46,425 --> 00:01:50,864
There are been, there has been an
historical data suggests that some

34
00:01:50,864 --> 00:01:52,394
of the misconfiguration can lead to.

35
00:01:53,254 --> 00:01:55,024
Some of the exploitation by the users.

36
00:01:55,264 --> 00:01:57,214
So they'll look into
these aspects as well.

37
00:01:57,574 --> 00:02:01,995
So these are the main, couple of threats
that we high level we are identifying

38
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:03,359
and trying to solve the problem.

39
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:06,349
So let us understand
what is the user plane.

40
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:08,539
User plane function is
the heart of the network.

41
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:11,679
It carries massive
amount of data at scale.

42
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:15,579
And this basically the packet from
the user recommend is transferred to

43
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:18,134
the external networks through UPF.

44
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:22,224
UPF forms an essential part of
your service based network on any

45
00:02:22,224 --> 00:02:24,374
mobile mobile service providers.

46
00:02:24,874 --> 00:02:28,134
So let us look into air driven,
multi risk scoring framework.

47
00:02:28,194 --> 00:02:30,054
So what it is, let's dive into that.

48
00:02:30,114 --> 00:02:31,884
So how are we going to solve the problem?

49
00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:37,144
So basically, traditionally you have this
signature based risk mitigation approach.

50
00:02:37,544 --> 00:02:40,444
We are not looking at that
with ai coming into picture.

51
00:02:40,804 --> 00:02:44,254
So you are actually looking at some of
the parameters like behavioral analysis,

52
00:02:44,734 --> 00:02:47,295
geographic context temporal indicators.

53
00:02:47,675 --> 00:02:50,405
Volumetric metrics and
historical intelligence.

54
00:02:50,435 --> 00:02:55,065
These are the five, parameters that
historically AI can look into and

55
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:57,445
consider all these factors and data.

56
00:02:57,535 --> 00:03:03,009
And, you can give a score to each of
the session and, make that session as

57
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:05,279
can be classified as a threat or not.

58
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:07,510
Let us look into the behavioral analysis.

59
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,010
Behavioral analysis is basically
when a session is user is, created

60
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,560
or session is created in the network.

61
00:03:12,929 --> 00:03:16,924
Look at how the the session behaves,
like session duration what are the packet

62
00:03:16,924 --> 00:03:18,814
sites sent through the system, et cetera.

63
00:03:19,264 --> 00:03:23,934
Collect all these details and continuously
monitor, monitor the patterns how it

64
00:03:23,934 --> 00:03:30,204
evolves and give you, give the session a
score high risk score medium, a low three

65
00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:32,424
levels of risking scoring me mechanism.

66
00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:35,534
You give it to each of the
session and then, predict.

67
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:40,659
This can be a potential threat the same
way, a geographical context historically,

68
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:46,489
from places where the threat has been
detected, and monitor or classify

69
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:50,949
any of the sessions originated from
those areas as high risk, sessions.

70
00:03:51,854 --> 00:03:56,084
Temporal indicators like time built,
pa, time-based patterns, et cetera.

71
00:03:56,154 --> 00:03:59,874
Activity, videos, all those things can
be considered and all metric metrics.

72
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:02,884
How long, how much data or how much usage.

73
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:06,394
And then there are, there
has been these ddo attacks

74
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:07,804
resource congestion, et cetera.

75
00:04:08,434 --> 00:04:11,944
And also you bring in some of the
historical intelligence patterns to it.

76
00:04:12,344 --> 00:04:16,754
Basically, past attacks, past nature,
and you have this entire database of.

77
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:21,919
All the past attacks that you can leverage
for the AI driven, monitoring system.

78
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:24,219
Lemme move into the next slide.

79
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:27,919
As I said the beyond signature based
detection from the traditional approach

80
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:33,439
we actually going into, going into a
driven approach wherein you actually feed

81
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,969
into the system with all the data that
we collect threat patterns, behavioral

82
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:44,819
context and then risk assessment detects
the, evasive ma massive techniques and,

83
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:47,059
multifactor correlation during the call.

84
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:49,934
Let us see how this happens in real time.

85
00:04:50,204 --> 00:04:53,894
So in real time you actually collect
a form continuous loop, right?

86
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:58,234
Basically a data addition from the real
time traffic and telemetric collection.

87
00:04:58,234 --> 00:05:02,839
You have the premises data, lot of
other, EDR or the CDRs from the call.

88
00:05:03,164 --> 00:05:07,184
Calls, you just basically fit into
the system and analyze the patterns

89
00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:08,744
evolving from those sessions.

90
00:05:09,344 --> 00:05:13,584
Then you have a risk scoring
mechanism where, as I said, you

91
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:17,694
basically give the, scoring for
each of the sessions how risk it is.

92
00:05:17,694 --> 00:05:22,314
If it is highly risk category, then you
put at higher risk score and then take

93
00:05:22,344 --> 00:05:24,084
based on that, you classify the threats.

94
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:26,114
And you have response actions.

95
00:05:26,324 --> 00:05:30,944
Not only you are just not monitoring the
system, but you actually have the response

96
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:33,034
actions automated through the, pipelines.

97
00:05:33,394 --> 00:05:35,764
So you have the mitigation pipelines.

98
00:05:35,764 --> 00:05:39,724
When the threat is classified and
threat you prevent those threats.

99
00:05:39,754 --> 00:05:43,414
If it is identified, then we have
a human element attached to the

100
00:05:43,414 --> 00:05:45,474
system where an analyst is trained.

101
00:05:45,534 --> 00:05:51,364
And then given all the, knowledge, to
go and execute the response actions if

102
00:05:51,364 --> 00:05:53,124
the session is classified as a threat.

103
00:05:54,024 --> 00:05:56,504
And as this model is
continuously evolving.

104
00:05:56,574 --> 00:06:00,714
You learn it, adapt it, and
continually, continuously learn

105
00:06:00,744 --> 00:06:04,524
and, expand the the areas where
this attack surface has happened.

106
00:06:05,024 --> 00:06:09,494
And coming to the pipeline, sorry,
pipelines that we have created it's a

107
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,644
tiered automated in a mitigation pipeline.

108
00:06:12,034 --> 00:06:16,004
You have this the, four levels of
operations, like when you have this

109
00:06:16,254 --> 00:06:20,004
enhanced monitoring, collect all the
datas from Promethease databases,

110
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:24,204
either E-D-R-C-D-S or whatever we
have, and monitor this and then,

111
00:06:24,304 --> 00:06:28,089
apply the once threat is identified,
you apply the traffic shaping.

112
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:30,939
So you have these policies
all written as part of the

113
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:32,649
pipeline, as a response action.

114
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:37,099
Initially when the threat is, and when a
session is identified as a threat, you.

115
00:06:37,384 --> 00:06:42,644
Basically apply some some of the initial
rules like traffic shaping qs adjusting

116
00:06:42,644 --> 00:06:44,684
the QS for those malicious calls.

117
00:06:45,134 --> 00:06:48,944
And then you, once you identify
the session, that's highly risk.

118
00:06:49,344 --> 00:06:52,624
It can be potential threat, you
just isolate isolate the session.

119
00:06:52,984 --> 00:06:55,514
And next stage is to
completely terminate it.

120
00:06:56,014 --> 00:07:00,504
Yeah, so our AI system is basically,
enforcing the policy at large.

121
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:05,244
So you have all the rules return in
there and then also, these rules,

122
00:07:05,544 --> 00:07:08,754
Al already rules are written that's
actually fed into the system.

123
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:12,854
And then even AI can, proactively
suggest the new rule is required

124
00:07:12,854 --> 00:07:14,444
to enforce some of the policies.

125
00:07:14,444 --> 00:07:19,689
So this is done at large scale and any
any threat mitigated through the system.

126
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,629
Let's look at some of the operational
benefits to the DevOps teams in this case

127
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:27,639
since we have all the pipelines in the,
in ready and automated response actions.

128
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:32,279
SRE teams or DevOps teams can highly
leverage from these pipelines.

129
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,869
So our first, as all
reduce the alert statics.

130
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:40,309
You have reduced alerts even
if the there is a alert before

131
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:41,989
feeding into the an analyst review.

132
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,279
Some of the automated action is
already performed when a threat

133
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:46,559
session is ed as a threat.

134
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:50,579
I'm not going deeper into this
because you already know there is a

135
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:52,679
faster insulin response due to this.

136
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:56,399
Benefits, one of the benefits and
operational consistency and continuous

137
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,169
improvement as well during this pipelines.

138
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:02,959
So what is the result of all these,
all of this actually once you have

139
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,739
this continuous monitoring system
and an AI agent sitting on in your

140
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:11,819
network, which continuously monitoring
and takes action whenever there is a

141
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,089
threat potential threat to the network.

142
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,169
And since it's rapid and adaptive
learning, you actually improve the

143
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:25,954
efficiency of the a the AI driven system
and and secure the network completely.

144
00:08:26,454 --> 00:08:30,734
So we have all these systems all these
pipelines all these agents created.

145
00:08:30,784 --> 00:08:35,274
Now how will we actually, integrated
this in the DevOps work workflow system?

146
00:08:35,624 --> 00:08:36,884
The framework is in place.

147
00:08:36,914 --> 00:08:40,884
Yeah, everything is in our compatible
with the kit GitHubs basically

148
00:08:40,914 --> 00:08:44,214
containerized it and then know
place it in your environment.

149
00:08:44,644 --> 00:08:46,734
Promethease metrics for automation.

150
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:50,209
It's an open source, and this
can be, used for the performance.

151
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:54,349
Tra tracking open Telemetry
is integrated into the system.

152
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,899
API first design, which is
basically a classic case for,

153
00:08:57,949 --> 00:09:01,969
helping the CICD pipeline and
Kubernetes friendly deployments.

154
00:09:01,969 --> 00:09:05,699
So this is another area which is
actually makes easy integration

155
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:07,629
to the DevOps workflows.

156
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:11,429
Getting started like how we want
to actually, put it in the system

157
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:14,889
how this works in in an environment
where already, it's running.

158
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:20,149
So we start slowly and gradually scale
into a, an, a full scale, full-fledged

159
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:22,579
automation execution or operation thing.

160
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:25,969
First establish a baseline where
you actually deeply observe.

161
00:09:25,969 --> 00:09:27,799
Learn the system, learn the network.

162
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:32,209
And slowly, adapt to the situation
where, which is a good call, bad call.

163
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:35,639
So instead of, going and, suddenly
starting it, so we give it one or two

164
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:41,259
weeks or a month that can be tuned or that
can be fed to the system before in hand.

165
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:42,519
And then once you have the.

166
00:09:43,404 --> 00:09:46,774
Baseline establishment, your
two, your policy definition based

167
00:09:46,774 --> 00:09:48,724
on the know telemetry pipeline.

168
00:09:48,724 --> 00:09:49,864
What are the data collected?

169
00:09:50,194 --> 00:09:56,234
And have this analyst trained and ready
to e once you, he wants to intervene in

170
00:09:56,234 --> 00:10:00,804
case there is a, there is an intervention
read then you actually in a scale to the

171
00:10:00,804 --> 00:10:05,414
full system where you actually gradually
automate everything and fully hand it

172
00:10:05,414 --> 00:10:08,064
over to the AA driven operation system.

173
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:12,654
So let us call this as a 5G of security
operations because it it it helps

174
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:14,474
to monitor the network at scale.

175
00:10:14,774 --> 00:10:17,544
You don't have to worry about,
deploying different agents at one

176
00:10:17,674 --> 00:10:19,744
different log geographical places.

177
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,904
You can have agents completely
monitoring your entire network

178
00:10:22,904 --> 00:10:24,574
with different geographical places.

179
00:10:24,844 --> 00:10:26,104
So this is very efficient.

180
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:28,294
Method of securing to network.

181
00:10:28,654 --> 00:10:32,594
Since it's continuously feedback,
the system is fed into the system.

182
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:38,795
Basically the entire system is secure
when you have deployed it in your network.

183
00:10:39,295 --> 00:10:41,895
So with that I'm closing this talk.

184
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:46,544
If you have any questions, please let
me know how this is being implemented.

185
00:10:46,544 --> 00:10:48,584
I'm happy to answer these questions.

186
00:10:49,124 --> 00:10:49,544
Thank you.

187
00:10:49,574 --> 00:10:53,045
Thank you for, watching this
and let me know anything.

188
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,064
Yeah, thank you.

189
00:10:54,275 --> 00:10:55,055
Thank you for time.

190
00:10:55,564 --> 00:10:55,954
Thanks.

191
00:10:56,045 --> 00:10:56,375
Bye.
