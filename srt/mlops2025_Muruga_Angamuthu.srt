00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,339
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:03,985
Good morning or good evening,
depending on your location.

3
00:00:04,485 --> 00:00:10,875
My name is MuTu and I have 23 years of
experience across data engineering, AI and

4
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:17,025
ML Cloud technologies, enterprise, BI data
science, and in the manufacturing sector.

5
00:00:17,415 --> 00:00:22,095
It's pleasure to be here at Con
42 to share insight on the topic.

6
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:25,244
AI driven predictive
maintenance that transforming

7
00:00:25,244 --> 00:00:26,450
the backbone of manufacturing.

8
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,520
For decades, factories have
relayed on two extremes.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,230
First one is waiting until the
occupant fails and then fix it, which

10
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:40,240
is reactive maintenance or carrying
out scheduled preventive maintenance

11
00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:42,580
that often wasting valuable resource.

12
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,700
But today we stand at pivotal moment.

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:52,900
With the power of AI data and connector
systems, we can move beyond reactive.

14
00:00:53,765 --> 00:00:58,715
Fire factoring and embrace proactive
intelligence maintenance that

15
00:00:58,805 --> 00:01:01,265
drives efficiency and resilience.

16
00:01:01,765 --> 00:01:02,635
Let's get started.

17
00:01:02,965 --> 00:01:04,224
Here is the agenda today.

18
00:01:04,724 --> 00:01:07,845
First, critical inflection
point in the manufacturing.

19
00:01:08,445 --> 00:01:11,145
Second, AI driven maintenance resolution.

20
00:01:11,565 --> 00:01:13,899
Third, evolution of
maintenance strategies.

21
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,140
For the technological Archite
architecture, enabling transformation,

22
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,429
fifth advanced AI methodology
in industrial environments.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,310
Six Real world stories.

24
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,540
Seven.

25
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,320
Why 60% of predictive
maintenance initiative fail?

26
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,120
Eight.

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,660
Implementation of blueprint for success.

28
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:36,890
Nine.

29
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,350
Emerging technology and the future trends.

30
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,440
10. Actionable roadmap for implementation.

31
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:44,705
11 key takeaway.

32
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:49,185
Let's start with industry
challenges, critical inflection

33
00:01:49,185 --> 00:01:50,475
point in manufacturing.

34
00:01:50,895 --> 00:01:53,625
Let's see why AI based
approach is essential.

35
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:58,145
Let's look at the problem and the
high cost of reactive maintenance.

36
00:01:58,505 --> 00:02:03,005
Manufacturers today are under the
pressure and a traditional way of

37
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:08,735
maintaining equipment are simply too
costly to sustain reactive maintenance.

38
00:02:09,215 --> 00:02:14,495
When equipment fails without warning,
the impact is massive up to three times.

39
00:02:14,575 --> 00:02:18,445
Three to 10 times more expensive
than predictive maintenance.

40
00:02:19,045 --> 00:02:25,405
The average loss during unplanned
downtime is up to $50,000 per hour.

41
00:02:25,885 --> 00:02:31,225
This includes production loss,
labor inefficiency, and sometimes

42
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:33,475
even penalties for late shipments.

43
00:02:33,975 --> 00:02:36,135
The market speaks for itself.

44
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:41,715
The AI in maintenance sector is
expected to grow from 4 billion

45
00:02:41,715 --> 00:02:45,045
to nearly 16 billion by 2028.

46
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:49,725
These numbers highlights why
manufacturers cannot afford to

47
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:51,810
stay in reactive maintenance.

48
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,675
Moving on to next AI driven
maintenance solution.

49
00:02:57,675 --> 00:03:02,925
Let's see what happens when
companies embrace AI for maintenance.

50
00:03:03,425 --> 00:03:05,255
One first industry implementing.

51
00:03:05,755 --> 00:03:11,815
AI maintenance have reported 50%
reduction in downtime, which is Hal the

52
00:03:11,815 --> 00:03:14,305
mission, offline time compared to before.

53
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:21,025
Second, 32% decrease in overall
maintenance cost, which includes

54
00:03:21,025 --> 00:03:23,485
parts, labor, and energy savings.

55
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,490
Third, perhaps the most impressive
is 385% return on investment.

56
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,550
These project don't just play themselves.

57
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:39,405
They multiply value delivered fourth, the
models provides provide eight to 12 days.

58
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:44,470
Advanced warning, which is
critical for planning downtime and

59
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,630
avoiding production disruptions.

60
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,580
This means organizations can
plan interventions, orders,

61
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,900
spare parts ahead of time, and
prevent crisis before they happen.

62
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,965
This represents shifting from reactive
maintenance to strategic ascent management

63
00:04:03,095 --> 00:04:05,085
where decisions are data driven.

64
00:04:05,585 --> 00:04:08,765
Next evolution of maintenance strategy.

65
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:13,865
Let's take a step back and look
at how maintenance has evolved.

66
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:19,475
First, reactive maintenance equipment
is fixed only after it breaks,

67
00:04:19,655 --> 00:04:21,875
which is leading to emergency fix.

68
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:26,940
Also, it costs us unpredictable cost
and a major production disruption.

69
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,720
Second Preventive maintenance here.

70
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:37,190
Maintenance follows Fixed schedule, often
replacing pos too early or too late here.

71
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:43,190
Downtime is reduced, but inefficiency is
there, and also waste of resource also,

72
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,995
is there third Predictive maintenance.

73
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:49,605
It is a conditional based
maintenance and a service.

74
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,350
The equipment as needed basis.

75
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,510
This method minimize disruption
while keeping the cost under control.

76
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,770
Fourth, AI driven
predictive excellence here.

77
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:06,540
Machine learnings predicts
failure up to 88%.

78
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:12,000
Accuracy also provides eight
to 12 days advance warning and

79
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,920
continuous improve over time.

80
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,950
Here we are moving from rigid
schedule two dynamic and data

81
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,550
driven decisions, moving to the next

82
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,800
technological architectures,
enabling transformations.

83
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,740
What make this possible?

84
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,734
Let's talk about technology stack
Number one, IOT sensor network.

85
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:38,555
Industrial missions Accu equipped
with sensor with the capturing

86
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:43,055
real time data like temperature,
vibration, pressure, et cetera.

87
00:05:43,565 --> 00:05:50,705
Each setup generates 1.5 to 2.3
terabyte of daily data, and also

88
00:05:50,705 --> 00:05:53,164
enables continuous health monitoring.

89
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:55,460
Second edge computing.

90
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:02,950
Onsite processing cuts response
time by 75 to 80 per 85% and

91
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,409
it pre-filter sensor data.

92
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:10,560
It also supports instant alert
and rapid decision making for

93
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,330
critical equipment conditions.

94
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,909
Third cloud data platform.

95
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:19,925
It is a scalable infrastructure
stores historical data and powers.

96
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:23,965
Powers Advanced ML
training and deployment.

97
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:30,595
It enables predictive model and cross
facility performance benchmarking.

98
00:06:31,255 --> 00:06:36,715
All together these layers gives
us both speed and intelligence.

99
00:06:37,675 --> 00:06:41,985
Moving on to the next
advanced AI methodology.

100
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,545
First auto encoder
based anomaly deduction.

101
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:50,915
It learns normal equipment
pattern to spot deviations.

102
00:06:51,785 --> 00:06:58,205
It also, it achieves 90% accuracy
with 31% fewer false alarms.

103
00:06:58,775 --> 00:07:03,080
Second random forecast forest classifier.

104
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,850
It classifies and pinpoints
specific failure mode.

105
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:15,030
It also delivers 78 8% precision
in the predictive diagnostics.

106
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:21,750
Third recurrent neural network
IT analysis analyze time serious

107
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,090
sensor data over long period.

108
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,760
Also, it deducts degradation
pattern before it failures.

109
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,870
Fourth digital twin simulations.

110
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,250
It creates virtual replica
of physical equipment.

111
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,960
Also, it boost prediction accuracy by 67%.

112
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,730
Throw simulation insights.

113
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,145
Each technique has a role
depending on the context.

114
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:51,610
Next, let's see the real
world success stories.

115
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,270
Why 60% of predictive
maintenance initiative fails.

116
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,500
Of course, not every initiative succeeds.

117
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,860
In fact, about 60% of project fails.

118
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,300
Let's see why it fails.

119
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,530
One, data ingestion complexities.

120
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:14,950
Nearly 80% of deployment struggles
with the legacy machine, siloed IT

121
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:18,100
system, and inconsistent data quality.

122
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,630
Also, lack of sensor and
poor standardization.

123
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,780
Slow down, reliable predictive insights.

124
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,980
Second scope and budget management
project often exceed budget by.

125
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,290
30 to 40% due to
underestimated complexity.

126
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:45,210
Overly wide scope, weak proof of concept
validation leads to cost, overturn,

127
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,275
and delayed return on investment.

128
00:08:47,775 --> 00:08:49,995
Third, organizational resistance.

129
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:56,895
Around 65% of technicians resistant,
resist, adopt adoption because fear

130
00:08:56,895 --> 00:09:02,975
in the job loss or not trusting
AI recommendations in inefficient

131
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:08,465
training and weak change management
amplify resistance to new system.

132
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:13,115
Predictive maintenance is not
just a technology problem, it is

133
00:09:13,115 --> 00:09:16,025
also about people and the process.

134
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,555
Moving to the next

135
00:09:18,055 --> 00:09:22,875
implementation blueprint for success,
first, value, first approach.

136
00:09:23,685 --> 00:09:27,240
We need to start with the most
critical equipment where the failure.

137
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:34,335
Cost is most and also focus on high
impact wins before wider rollout.

138
00:09:34,905 --> 00:09:38,595
Second, strategic data integration build.

139
00:09:38,685 --> 00:09:43,305
Yeah, unified data architecture
by linking maintenance, production

140
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:46,445
and quality system breakdown silos.

141
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:49,145
To enable seamless predict two insights.

142
00:09:49,645 --> 00:09:51,535
Third, human center design.

143
00:09:52,035 --> 00:09:57,315
It engage technicians early in the
process to shape tools and workflows.

144
00:09:57,825 --> 00:09:58,670
It creates.

145
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,830
Natural interface that
builds trust and adoptions.

146
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,690
Fourth phase to scaling.

147
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:10,030
We need to scale step by step with the
return on investment validation at each

148
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:16,390
stage, and also prevent budget over time
while ensuring measurable business value.

149
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:21,420
When you follow this blueprint,
adoption improves significantly.

150
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,380
Emerging technology and the future trends.

151
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,315
Let's see what is next here.

152
00:10:26,815 --> 00:10:27,165
First.

153
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:29,365
Explainable ai.

154
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:34,645
It uses transparent algorithm that
makes predictions human interpretable.

155
00:10:35,545 --> 00:10:41,125
It builds trust among technicians
and also increase adoption by 47%.

156
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:45,835
Second system level monitor,
it goes beyond single component

157
00:10:45,835 --> 00:10:46,975
to capture, cascading effect.

158
00:10:47,475 --> 00:10:52,485
It enables entire insight across the
Interconnector production system.

159
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,185
Third, sustainability applications.

160
00:10:55,685 --> 00:11:02,285
AI driven maintenance cuts unnecessarily
energy and resource U usage.

161
00:11:03,035 --> 00:11:11,105
It lowers emission by 500 to 1500
metric tons per facility each year.

162
00:11:12,065 --> 00:11:15,995
This is about building a
smart, sustainable factories

163
00:11:16,495 --> 00:11:17,815
X number roadmap.

164
00:11:18,315 --> 00:11:20,115
Here is the practical roadmap.

165
00:11:20,955 --> 00:11:22,155
First is foundation.

166
00:11:23,055 --> 00:11:27,825
It takes one to three months time
to build a foundation, access

167
00:11:27,825 --> 00:11:30,495
equipment, criticality, set.

168
00:11:30,945 --> 00:11:35,175
Baseline metrics and deploy
sensor on top assets.

169
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:39,795
Begin data collection and
integration to build the

170
00:11:39,795 --> 00:11:42,045
foundation for predictive insights.

171
00:11:42,405 --> 00:11:44,505
Second pilot implementations.

172
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:48,135
This process takes four
to six months of time.

173
00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:54,515
Apply ML models to highest impact
equipment and then train the

174
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:57,185
