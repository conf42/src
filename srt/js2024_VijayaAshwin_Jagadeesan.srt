and improve the healthcare management.

15
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:07,519
The pandemic driven shift is a main
cause like the COVID 19 fundamentally

16
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:12,729
accelerated the adoption of digital
health tools as face to face interactions

17
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:17,704
become limited and the telehealth
services surged by more than 150 percent.

18
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:23,724
The pandemic forced the healthcare
systems to rapidly adapt and many

19
00:01:23,724 --> 00:01:28,214
patients become comfortable using digital
solutions for their healthcare needs.

20
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,334
The shift is not temporary.

So these technologies are poised
to change how the patient care is

27
00:01:57,194 --> 00:02:02,434
delivered by enabling more precise
diagnosis, personalized treatments, and

28
00:02:02,434 --> 00:02:04,344
more efficient healthcare management.

29
00:02:04,844 --> 00:02:09,314
Healthcare operations will benefit
from predictive analysis, making

30
00:02:09,314 --> 00:02:13,244
systems more responsive and
proactive rather than reactive.

31
00:02:13,744 --> 00:02:16,309
Let's see the key healthcare IT trends.

32
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,749
The first and foremost is an AI and ML.

33
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:25,999
So diagnostic enhancement, the AI
is transforming the diagnostics by

34
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:31,109
identifying the patterns in medical
imaging or patient data that are

35
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:33,029
hard for human doctors to detect.

36
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:37,819
For example, AI can help reduce the
false positives in cancer screenings.

37
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,609
Then how it helps the
personalized statements.

38
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:45,419
So the AI driven algorithms analyze
the patient data to recommend the

39
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:46,824
tailor treatment plans for the patient.

40
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:51,054
And this can improve the patient
outcomes by factoring in unique health

41
00:02:51,054 --> 00:02:53,214
conditions and genetic profiles.

42
00:02:53,714 --> 00:02:55,874
And next, the predictive analytics.

43
00:02:56,074 --> 00:03:00,854
So AI can anticipate the patient
needs, optimize treatment pathways,

44
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:04,304
and reduce the complications
through preemptive analytics.

45
00:03:04,804 --> 00:03:07,514
And let's see the role of
the advanced data analytics.

46
00:03:08,074 --> 00:03:12,114
So the advanced data analytics
enables healthcare providers to shift

47
00:03:12,144 --> 00:03:15,434
through vast amounts of health data.

48
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:17,619
to extract actionable insights.

49
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,629
So the better decision making like the
analytics can provide the real time

50
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:28,979
data for the healthcare professionals to
make informed timely decisions which is

51
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:31,129
crucial for the patient safety and care.

52
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:33,909
How it is impacting the population health?

53
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:39,669
The analytics can be used to make a manage
large portions, identify the trends and

54
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:41,729
address the health risk proactively.

55
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:44,619
Let's see about the interoperability
and cloud migrations.

56
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:49,059
as the healthcare systems integrate
with legacy systems, with the, and

57
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:53,329
then with the new technologies,
the seamless communications between

58
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:54,789
the systems becomes crucial.

59
00:03:55,539 --> 00:04:01,039
So the interoperability allows data to
be shared across multiple platforms,

60
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:02,919
improving the care continuity.

61
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:07,959
And the cloud migration, the cloud
based solutions offer scalable, secure

62
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,119
storage and enable easier access to
patient data for healthcare providers.

63
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:17,519
Trying down the cost while
improving the system performance.

64
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:19,929
Next, the blockchain for security.

65
00:04:19,929 --> 00:04:22,709
This is a major topic, which
we will see in the later part,

66
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:24,429
but here like a high level.

67
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:30,239
So the blockchain is making a tremendous
improvement in the security of

68
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:35,659
healthcare data by creating immutable
decentralized ledgers that ensures the

69
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:37,929
integrity and privacy of patient data.

70
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,019
with respect to cost saving, the
blockchain technology can potentially

71
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:48,209
save billions by reducing the fraud,
errors, and cost, with respect to

72
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:50,039
the managing, healthcare records.

73
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:54,194
And let's see the power of
AI and ML in healthcare.

74
00:04:54,694 --> 00:05:00,584
So the AI and ML plays a major role
in the accuracy of the diagnostics.

75
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:07,094
So the AI has demonstrated its potential
in diagnostics with applications like

76
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:11,794
breast cancer detection, improving
the accuracy by reducing both false

77
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,994
and, false positives and negatives.

78
00:05:14,124 --> 00:05:16,464
This not only saves lives.

79
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:21,264
But also reduces unnecessary
treatments, with respect to

80
00:05:21,264 --> 00:05:22,849
personalized treatment plans.

81
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:26,779
So AI helps, craft individualized
treatment plans, which

82
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:28,389
improves the patient outcomes.

83
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:34,389
For instance, using the AI for,
depression treatment, so that in 6 percent

84
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:39,339
higher emission rates showcasing the
promise of data driven, cash outages.

85
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,099
And, let's see the, advanced
data analytics, like how it

86
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:44,344
is helping the healthcare.

87
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,974
with respect to the population health
management, the predictive analytics

88
00:05:49,204 --> 00:05:53,984
helps in identifying the high risk
patients for conditions such as, diabetes

89
00:05:54,034 --> 00:05:56,074
or heart diseases with high accuracy.

90
00:05:56,784 --> 00:06:01,584
So by anticipating health issues, the
healthcare providers can intervene,

91
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,904
earlier to prevent the complications.

92
00:06:04,404 --> 00:06:08,204
And with operational efficiency,
analytics can optimize the

93
00:06:08,204 --> 00:06:09,914
hospital workloads, workflows.

94
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:15,494
So improving the resource allocation and
reducing the bottlenecks such as emergency

95
00:06:15,494 --> 00:06:17,254
room boarding or discharge delays.

96
00:06:17,964 --> 00:06:21,974
So this directly leads to better
patient experiences and more

97
00:06:21,984 --> 00:06:24,084
efficient use of the resources.

98
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:29,314
And in the research and development,
the big data enables faster drug

99
00:06:29,794 --> 00:06:35,554
discovery by analyzing Millions or
even billions of compounds are creating

100
00:06:35,554 --> 00:06:40,174
the development of new treatments and
improving the outcomes of clinical trials.

101
00:06:40,674 --> 00:06:44,254
And, next is an interoperability
and cloud migrations.

102
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:49,394
The integration of outdated legacy
systems into the modern cloud

103
00:06:49,414 --> 00:06:53,704
infrastructure is a top priority for many
hospitals and healthcare institutions.

104
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:58,134
So to, ensuring these systems
communicate seamlessly.

105
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,984
is essential for delivering
uninterrupted patient care.

106
00:07:02,484 --> 00:07:06,904
The API solutions like the Fast
Healthcare Interoperability Resources,

107
00:07:07,404 --> 00:07:13,614
FHIR APIs, they drastically reduce the
time required to integrate discrete

108
00:07:13,644 --> 00:07:18,724
healthcare systems, thus improving the
ability to share data across platforms.

109
00:07:19,224 --> 00:07:21,734
The healthcare cloud
computing market is growing.

110
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:25,214
about to reach like 64.

111
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:28,614
7 billion dollars by next year 2025.

112
00:07:29,254 --> 00:07:33,524
so the cloud solutions offer
enhanced system performance, cost

113
00:07:33,524 --> 00:07:38,394
savings, scalable data storage,
making it a critical investment for

114
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:39,894
future ready healthcare systems.

115
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:44,664
next let's talk about the blockchain,
strengthening, how it strengthens

116
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,084
the healthcare data security.

117
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:50,724
by offering a secure, transparent
way to manage patient data, the

118
00:07:50,724 --> 00:07:55,724
blockchain reduces the risk of data
breaches, increases the transparency,

119
00:07:55,774 --> 00:07:57,964
and strengthens the patient privacy.

120
00:07:58,514 --> 00:08:01,004
let's see the decentralization
and how it works.

121
00:08:01,504 --> 00:08:02,124
immutability.

122
00:08:02,654 --> 00:08:07,224
So the blockchain technology operates
on a decentralized network, where

123
00:08:07,224 --> 00:08:12,074
data is stored across multiple nodes,
emulating a single point of failure.

124
00:08:12,884 --> 00:08:17,514
So this significantly reduces the
chances of cyber attacks compared

125
00:08:17,514 --> 00:08:19,234
to the centralized databases.

126
00:08:19,804 --> 00:08:24,514
So once data is written on, on a
blockchain, it is immutable, meaning

127
00:08:24,854 --> 00:08:28,024
it cannot be altered or deleted
without the consensus from the

128
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,894
network, ensuring the data integrity.

129
00:08:31,394 --> 00:08:36,464
So next is like the encryption
and crypto cryptographic hashing.

130
00:08:36,964 --> 00:08:40,884
The blockchain uses advanced
crypto, advanced encryption and

131
00:08:41,424 --> 00:08:45,684
cryptographic hashing algorithms
like SHA two six to secure the data.

132
00:08:46,184 --> 00:08:51,384
This provides an extra layer of security,
as sensitive data is encrypted, making

133
00:08:51,384 --> 00:08:55,674
it more difficult for the unauthorized
users to access or tam with it.

134
00:08:56,174 --> 00:09:00,404
The cryptographic hashing ensures
that any changes to the data, will

135
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:05,434
result in a completely different hash,
making it evident if a breach occurs.

136
00:09:05,934 --> 00:09:10,274
And, next is like smart
contracts for, security.

137
00:09:10,774 --> 00:09:15,624
So the smart contracts self executing
contracts with the terms of the agreement

138
00:09:15,924 --> 00:09:19,634
directly written into the code can
be used in the blockchain systems to

139
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:22,224
automatically enforce security protocols.

140
00:09:22,574 --> 00:09:28,424
For example, they can ensure that the
data access is granted only to authorized

141
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:33,844
individuals and the actions are executed
only when predefined conditions are met.

142
00:09:34,154 --> 00:09:39,604
So further securing the sensitive
data like PHI or PCI, anything.

143
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:45,584
Every transaction or data entry in
a blockchain network is recorded in

144
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:47,944
a transparent and verifiable way.

145
00:09:48,484 --> 00:09:52,564
So this provides a detailed audit
trail, allowing the healthcare

146
00:09:52,794 --> 00:09:57,294
organizations to track the data
provenance and ensure compliance with

147
00:09:57,574 --> 00:10:02,434
regulatory requirements such as GDPR
or HIPAA in industries like healthcare.

148
00:10:02,934 --> 00:10:07,814
So the blockchain's secure
infrastructure significantly reduces

149
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:09,714
the potential for data breaches.

150
00:10:10,064 --> 00:10:14,944
So unlike the traditional systems
where hackers may gain access to the

151
00:10:14,944 --> 00:10:19,564
entire database, but the blockchain's
decentralized nature ensures that

152
00:10:19,904 --> 00:10:24,064
even if one node is compromised, the
rest of the system remains secure.

153
00:10:24,564 --> 00:10:28,244
Let's see an real world example
where the blockchain is used.

154
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:32,394
Estonia's national blockchain
for e health data security.

155
00:10:33,004 --> 00:10:37,094
So the east the estonia is a leading
example of the use of blockchain

156
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:42,784
technology to secure the sensitive
healthcare data the estonian government

157
00:10:43,444 --> 00:10:47,924
Used the blockchain based system for
managing and securing the citizens

158
00:10:47,924 --> 00:10:53,114
health records in their national So
by leveraging the blockchain, Estonia

159
00:10:53,114 --> 00:10:58,724
ensures that healthcare records are
tamper proof and can be accessed only

160
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:03,824
by the authorized individuals, which
strengthens data privacy and security.

161
00:11:04,314 --> 00:11:08,204
Additionally, the system allows
patients to have full control over

162
00:11:08,494 --> 00:11:10,684
who can view their medical records.

163
00:11:11,114 --> 00:11:17,764
So Estonia's blockchain based health
system has, Prove that there is a

164
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:19,804
reduction in their data breaches.

165
00:11:20,184 --> 00:11:24,824
And it has, also improved the patient
trust as they assured that their person

166
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,784
data is being secured, securely managed.

167
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:34,514
So this real world implementation shows
how blockchain can change the, and improve

168
00:11:34,514 --> 00:11:39,314
the data security, especially in the
sectors handling the, most sensitive data.

169
00:11:39,814 --> 00:11:44,424
