00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,240
Welcome to Azure Virtual Desktop
with Terraform Infrastructures as

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,430
a Code for a Secure Experience.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:11,599
This presentation appeared
because I had this question.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,849
Is there a way to implement a
secure and replicable infrastructure

5
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:18,829
that meets specific standards?

6
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:23,409
And this presentation, I hope
I answered that question.

7
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:30,099
First, a lot of things are coming
again, like clothes, shoes,

8
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:32,849
glasses, the vintage experience.

9
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,929
The terminal also came back again.

10
00:00:36,419 --> 00:00:40,709
Those that have a little bit
more experience know what I'm

11
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:41,969
talking about, the terminal.

12
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:42,909
server.

13
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:46,039
First, I would like to talk about me.

14
00:00:46,459 --> 00:00:47,729
I am Carlos Elizalazar.

15
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:52,149
I am one of the leaders in
Comunidad Dojo in Panama.

16
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:59,909
We help people, we transform life through
cyber security, teach them, or help

17
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:02,179
them to find even a new career path.

18
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:08,759
also have a lot of certification
related to Azure and Microsoft 365.

19
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:14,289
I am Microsoft Certified Trainer and
also Terraform Certified Associated.

20
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:20,069
I have, some reconnection in some
Microsoft internal communities.

21
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:24,809
also I am a Microsoft MVP in Azure area.

22
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,629
I currently work in Aus Digital
Consulting as a senior, Cloud

23
00:01:30,699 --> 00:01:36,749
architect or senior cloud solution
architect and a fun fact about me.

24
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,639
I know seven ways to prepare black coffee.

25
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:44,729
So if you like coffee, you can
ping me and I help you with that.

26
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:50,519
Also, don't look for me as a Carlos
Solis because this is will be the result.

27
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:52,729
That is a fictional character.

28
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:53,849
So please don't.

29
00:01:54,754 --> 00:01:58,404
Use Carlos or Lisa to try
to find me on Internet.

30
00:01:58,854 --> 00:02:04,404
We'll be talking about what is Azure
virtual desktop, of course, and we'll

31
00:02:04,404 --> 00:02:09,154
be talking about the infrastructure and
architecture around Azure virtual desktop.

32
00:02:09,434 --> 00:02:13,744
What is and how we will
secure Azure virtual desktop?

33
00:02:14,574 --> 00:02:14,914
What is.

34
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:19,129
Terraform, what is a infrastructure
as a code with Terraform?

35
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:24,155
we will talking about, Terraform
lifecycle, and, we will see,

36
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:26,555
talk about how Terraform works.

37
00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:31,075
And at the end, we will explore
the code for this demonstration.

38
00:02:31,465 --> 00:02:38,375
First, I would like to show you that still
we don't have create any Azure In fact, if

39
00:02:38,385 --> 00:02:41,295
you see here, this is my Terraform code.

40
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,845
So I first, I would like
to show you my environment.

41
00:02:44,845 --> 00:02:48,145
I don't have create
any new resource group.

42
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:54,115
So first we need to create our
environment or init our environment.

43
00:02:55,035 --> 00:03:01,225
I will explain any of these commands in a
couple of minutes during the presentation.

44
00:03:01,655 --> 00:03:03,955
So first we init the environment.

45
00:03:04,455 --> 00:03:08,345
And then we will apply our configuration,

46
00:03:08,845 --> 00:03:17,135
then we'll start reading our file, our
configuration files, and it's asking

47
00:03:17,135 --> 00:03:19,475
me to create a lot of resources.

48
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:24,905
Let's say yes, then we will explain
about any of these environments.

49
00:03:24,965 --> 00:03:29,005
Let's go back to the presentation
and in a few minutes we will

50
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,395
come back to our environment.

51
00:03:31,805 --> 00:03:35,605
So first, what is Azure Virtual Desktop?

52
00:03:36,105 --> 00:03:41,475
And Azure Virtual Desktop, it's
a VDI infrastructure, virtual

53
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:47,195
desktop infrastructure To
virtualize service and workstation.

54
00:03:47,235 --> 00:03:48,305
When to use it?

55
00:03:49,285 --> 00:03:53,485
For example, when you have some
geographical limitation, you can

56
00:03:53,865 --> 00:03:59,225
force your user use those, that
environment in a secure way.

57
00:03:59,835 --> 00:04:05,475
Also, when you have IoT environments and
you need to access to that environment

58
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:12,125
with a terminal, you can use this
environment or Use a BD to access

59
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,175
to that environment in a secure way.

60
00:04:14,915 --> 00:04:19,075
And also when you have a lot of
people working around the world

61
00:04:19,355 --> 00:04:23,835
and need access to a secure
environment, this is a good option.

62
00:04:24,405 --> 00:04:26,075
So I should be to a desktop.

63
00:04:26,815 --> 00:04:31,345
One part on one big part is
administrated by Microsoft.

64
00:04:31,415 --> 00:04:32,815
We don't administrate.

65
00:04:33,225 --> 00:04:40,115
The gateway, the web access,
the connection broker, the some

66
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:45,115
diagnostic is tools, even the
license related to that environment.

67
00:04:45,315 --> 00:04:48,645
All those resources will be
administrated by Microsoft.

68
00:04:49,015 --> 00:04:50,735
What are we going to administrate?

69
00:04:50,785 --> 00:04:55,295
The session host, for example,
the regular, windows or

70
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:56,775
linux, windows environment.

71
00:04:57,185 --> 00:05:03,595
And, also the image of those custom,
custom OS could be possible, the

72
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:09,135
applications related to that session
host, and also the users through

73
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:12,195
our domain controller or Enter ID.

74
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:17,615
One good aspect related to
Azure Virtual Desktop is that

75
00:05:17,675 --> 00:05:19,245
you can use it in your browser.

76
00:05:19,525 --> 00:05:22,615
In fact, you can use
it in any environment.

77
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:22,895
for your time.

78
00:05:23,245 --> 00:05:26,775
or any device that support HTML5.

79
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:33,785
So you can connect to your environment
through the browser or even if in Windows

80
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:35,875
or Mac you can use the application.

81
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:40,600
So to understand a little bit
how Azure Virtual Desktop network

82
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:46,660
connectivity works, let's say our user
is in a laptop table, or a computer.

83
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,760
Tablet or even a phone.

84
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,460
He first authenticate in our entry did.

85
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,510
During that authentication, they
will use the web access, the portal.

86
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:03,010
And if we have the authorization,
also we are connected to the gateway.

87
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,980
And it's the ends ID that will
allow us to connect to our session

88
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,650
host, our desktop application.

89
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,880
And all that is through HTTPS.

90
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,080
We don't have to create this
firewall or this other firewall.

91
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,890
Those resource are administrated
by Microsoft, so we don't have

92
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,800
to open the Port TT eight nine.

93
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,950
We just use our browser authentic
k with our ID credentials, and then

94
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,690
we can enter in the environment.

95
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:40,180
A good security layer
related to Azure Desktop is.

96
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,570
We will use our Entry ID Authentication.

97
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,680
So using Entry ID Authentication,
we can use our process of

98
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,047
multifactor authentication.

99
00:06:51,047 --> 00:06:55,293
We start, evaluating the
user, the location of the

100
00:06:55,293 --> 00:06:57,853
user, The device is a phone.

101
00:06:57,893 --> 00:07:00,573
A computer is a computer.

102
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:05,853
A trusted computer is a new computer,
which application the user is

103
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,123
connecting and the real time risk.

104
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:11,823
Those are some evaluation
related, different variables.

105
00:07:12,518 --> 00:07:18,178
All those values can allow us
to connect or will ask you for,

106
00:07:18,178 --> 00:07:22,808
we will require multi factor
authentication to enter or even block.

107
00:07:23,238 --> 00:07:26,718
And when we pass this, we can
access to our environment.

108
00:07:26,938 --> 00:07:31,068
So we have the first layer is
related to the authentication.

109
00:07:31,138 --> 00:07:34,708
If the user cannot authenticate
in Azure Virtual Desktop, cannot

110
00:07:34,758 --> 00:07:36,048
access to the environment.

111
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:39,998
Then we can, in all
session hosts, we can use.

112
00:07:40,443 --> 00:07:42,153
Microsoft Defender for endpoint.

113
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:48,943
So we can have our malware protection
layer covered with this solution, and

114
00:07:48,963 --> 00:07:56,013
also we can monitor all the behavior
of the OS in our environment and to

115
00:07:56,053 --> 00:08:02,243
administrate all those machines in
Azure Virtual Desktop, we can use, for

116
00:08:02,263 --> 00:08:10,273
example, the Active Directory domain
service to apply some GPOs in the OS, but

117
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:13,383
also we can implement Microsoft Intune.

118
00:08:13,453 --> 00:08:19,463
That is a service, a fast service of
administration of a mobile device.

119
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:26,213
So we can apply controls to our
host from, Microsoft Intune and

120
00:08:26,213 --> 00:08:28,033
the Microsoft infrastructure.

121
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:34,573
Another good thing related to Azure
Virtual Desktop is we can apply a disaster

122
00:08:34,593 --> 00:08:37,093
recovery infrastructure really cheap.

123
00:08:37,378 --> 00:08:39,858
And really fast in our environment.

124
00:08:40,218 --> 00:08:46,128
When we have a disaster, let's say in a
point we have a disaster in the region

125
00:08:46,448 --> 00:08:51,508
can be in the region, the Microsoft
region and the Azure region and we

126
00:08:51,508 --> 00:08:58,718
can replicate or we have activated a
replication of our OS on session host.

127
00:08:59,368 --> 00:09:04,318
For the user will be really
transparent, connect to another region.

128
00:09:04,338 --> 00:09:07,868
Maybe they will have some latency,
but can access to the environment.

129
00:09:08,408 --> 00:09:12,258
And they not necessarily
lost a lot of information.

130
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:14,328
Maybe it's a little bit information.

131
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:20,008
In Azure Virtual Desktop, you have
a lot of way to set and save the

132
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:22,268
data of the user in real time.

133
00:09:22,768 --> 00:09:24,088
Let's talk about Terraform.

134
00:09:24,588 --> 00:09:27,118
First, let's talk about
infrastructure as a code.

135
00:09:27,128 --> 00:09:31,348
It's a practice of managing and
provisioning compute infrastructure

136
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:36,488
like servers, networking, database,
and even a lot of more resources

137
00:09:36,798 --> 00:09:39,938
through machine, machine readable file.

138
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:45,438
we can control our, Resources
and change all the resources.

139
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:48,698
But what is a infrastructure as a code?

140
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:50,798
with Terraform is from HashiCorp.

141
00:09:51,298 --> 00:09:57,378
company is an infrastructure as a code
tool and will let you define, and an

142
00:09:57,378 --> 00:10:01,788
infrastructure in a human readable
dec declarative configuration file.

143
00:10:01,848 --> 00:10:06,228
We receive the file, don't worry and
manage the infrastructure lifecycle.

144
00:10:06,998 --> 00:10:08,283
And using Terra phone you have.

145
00:10:08,798 --> 00:10:14,418
Several advantage and I would like to
talk why I start using Terraform in my

146
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:17,828
case, I was working with some developers.

147
00:10:17,878 --> 00:10:21,788
We implement Azure DevOps
in the deployment of the

148
00:10:21,808 --> 00:10:24,188
code, but usually we have.

149
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:31,628
Some issues, some communication issues
related and the deployment of the

150
00:10:31,628 --> 00:10:37,478
infrastructure in production in QA
and in the in development environment.

151
00:10:37,728 --> 00:10:41,948
So I started learning Terraform
to deploy the environment.

152
00:10:41,978 --> 00:10:47,673
This allow us to Manage the infrastructure
and have control of the infrastructure.

153
00:10:47,673 --> 00:10:53,463
So in a point I when I had conversation
with them and they told me the developer

154
00:10:53,773 --> 00:10:59,103
I don't have access, the configuration
for QA is not the same from production.

155
00:10:59,783 --> 00:11:03,203
I start from the beginning
telling that it's not possible.

156
00:11:03,493 --> 00:11:04,743
It is the same code.

157
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:10,708
So when it's the same code, Code you
there is no a way that the configuration

158
00:11:10,748 --> 00:11:13,798
is not the same in any environment.

159
00:11:13,978 --> 00:11:17,688
So we first can't manage
any infrastructure.

160
00:11:17,738 --> 00:11:22,508
We can manage a lot of
infrastructure related to, for

161
00:11:22,508 --> 00:11:28,418
example, Azure, AWS, Google cloud,
even, being where environment we

162
00:11:28,418 --> 00:11:31,008
can manage that infrastructure.

163
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:34,273
We can standardize, deployments.

164
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:38,203
And, eh, the deployment workflow.

165
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:44,823
When we have this big workflow that we
need, eh, we won't have any issue, any

166
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:51,653
problems because, eh, the code that we
already test in one moment, we can know

167
00:11:51,683 --> 00:11:57,293
that, eh, that code will be deployed
in any environment, each environment,

168
00:11:58,213 --> 00:11:59,748
which you can track the infrastructure.

169
00:12:00,718 --> 00:12:08,028
One thing that I really like it because
in the projects usually somebody edit

170
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:13,248
or modify the infrastructure directly
in Azure, for example, directly edit

171
00:12:13,248 --> 00:12:17,858
and modify the environment so telephone.

172
00:12:17,918 --> 00:12:19,368
I can know where.

173
00:12:20,063 --> 00:12:23,243
they change and what is
the value that they change.

174
00:12:23,253 --> 00:12:28,683
For example, in my case, when I have the
issues with the developers, they make a

175
00:12:28,683 --> 00:12:34,733
change in the developer environment, I
can see it and apply that modification

176
00:12:35,183 --> 00:12:41,169
in QA and production to allow the
functioning of the application, the

177
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:43,522
correct functioning of the application.

178
00:12:43,522 --> 00:12:53,468
Also, when you have a GitHub, You can
use the environment, for example, that

179
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:58,308
is an example in a current project that
I have, we have some architect working,

180
00:12:58,328 --> 00:13:03,848
developing the Terraform code, everyone
is working a piece of the environment,

181
00:13:04,128 --> 00:13:05,598
and we are updating the environment.

182
00:13:05,908 --> 00:13:11,958
Same repository, and we have one code
for all the components that we need

183
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:19,428
infrastructure, and I just need to use git
and make a git pull, git push, and merge

184
00:13:19,478 --> 00:13:27,903
a branch, but I can't Work on a lot of
the team can work in the same code with

185
00:13:27,903 --> 00:13:30,193
the correct planification coordination.

186
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,853
What is the life cycle of telephone?

187
00:13:32,863 --> 00:13:36,703
I started the presentation
doing some comments.

188
00:13:36,723 --> 00:13:38,413
Let's explain those comments.

189
00:13:38,823 --> 00:13:40,763
First is the telephone in it.

190
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:48,503
Telephone in it will read your main file,
will read which modules, which providers.

191
00:13:48,813 --> 00:13:53,763
Are you using, for example, in my case,
I am using a module that I developed

192
00:13:54,103 --> 00:13:56,613
and using the Azure Rm provider.

193
00:13:57,293 --> 00:14:03,803
using those, values in the environment,
if they, Terraform will download the, all

194
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:06,763
the information that they to run locally.

195
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,473
There is a command.

196
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:11,903
We didn't run it, but we
can run a Terraform plan.

197
00:14:12,163 --> 00:14:19,313
Terraform plan will help us to identify
what a what is the modification?

198
00:14:19,543 --> 00:14:23,743
What are the code that
we are implementing?

199
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:28,778
And if they change that we want
to apply, is the correct one.

200
00:14:28,978 --> 00:14:33,448
Just will show you, show us
what is the plan that we have.

201
00:14:33,828 --> 00:14:38,428
The code that we just run
is the Terraform apply.

202
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:42,868
Terraform apply, we read our
configuration and then when they read

203
00:14:42,868 --> 00:14:48,433
the configuration, they will Execute
and create the resources that they have.

204
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:53,123
They first run the Terraform
Apply, will run a Terraform plan.

205
00:14:53,623 --> 00:14:59,593
And when they run that Terraform plan,
will ask a question, I have to answer yes.

206
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:02,123
And that is the only possible answer.

207
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:06,288
If you respond, anything else
will be canceled the application.

208
00:15:06,718 --> 00:15:12,638
So they, after we answered yes, they
started creating the environment.

209
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:18,078
And at the end, the final of the
life cycle is Terraform Destroy.

210
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,918
I can destroy a complete
and complex environment.

211
00:15:22,678 --> 00:15:27,528
Within minutes, just applying this
command, they'll also will read all the

212
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:32,938
information and tell me if I have agree
of the destruction of the environment.

213
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:38,858
So we have to be really sure about it,
but we just need to run this comment.

214
00:15:39,228 --> 00:15:44,828
I can run all this and in less than
an hour, I can create a complex

215
00:15:44,828 --> 00:15:48,918
environment, make my test, do all the.

216
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,973
Test that I need to do the
demo that I need to do.

217
00:15:53,443 --> 00:15:55,343
And then I destroy the environment.

218
00:15:55,353 --> 00:15:59,123
That is a cheaper way to, to
have a complex environment.

219
00:15:59,603 --> 00:16:04,043
make my test, any time that
I want, how Terraform works.

220
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:04,713
I have.

221
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:10,853
A file in Windows is Terraform
do access file in Linux.

222
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:15,203
We just install the epi
installed Terraform.

223
00:16:15,563 --> 00:16:18,188
We will install the
executable of that comment.

224
00:16:18,548 --> 00:16:20,138
So that's executable.

225
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:24,528
When we run these comments
that I show previously, they

226
00:16:24,528 --> 00:16:26,748
read the files that I create.

227
00:16:27,248 --> 00:16:31,268
They read the files, they
create and update constantly

228
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,398
A file called telephone dot.

229
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:42,398
TF State, this show the state of
the environment, in, in, in a file.

230
00:16:43,058 --> 00:16:47,708
And we will connect to a multiple
providers, like I said, AWS Azure,

231
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,928
Google Cloud, even digital Ocean.

232
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:55,063
So if I make a change in the,
in the environment and run

233
00:16:55,063 --> 00:16:56,983
the Terra code, they will.

234
00:16:57,388 --> 00:17:01,308
Evaluate what I have in Terraform
state, what I have in the environment

235
00:17:01,558 --> 00:17:02,858
and what I have in the file.

236
00:17:03,248 --> 00:17:08,398
And if something has changed in
the environment, then show me

237
00:17:08,408 --> 00:17:13,068
in the code and in the prompt, I
will see what is the difference.

238
00:17:13,538 --> 00:17:17,408
Related to my file, my Terraform
state file and the environment.

239
00:17:17,658 --> 00:17:23,558
So with that, I can know somebody modified
something that didn't, I didn't provide,

240
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:29,848
didn't authorize, or that wasn't the
plan, or if it is, if the plan, I can

241
00:17:29,858 --> 00:17:34,468
update my Terraform code and run again
the command and we say that everything is.

242
00:17:34,863 --> 00:17:35,293
It's okay.

243
00:17:35,673 --> 00:17:40,433
So enough talking, let's show you
a little bit about the environment

244
00:17:40,463 --> 00:17:42,753
and the code that we deploy.

245
00:17:42,933 --> 00:17:49,243
So as you can see, we
find, we run our command.

246
00:17:49,323 --> 00:17:56,643
A lot of resources were created,
25 blocks, but not the resources.

247
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:59,203
So a lot of thing was creating.

248
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:01,833
I will explain to you the code.

249
00:18:02,218 --> 00:18:08,738
But let's see how, that is in
the end user point of view.

250
00:18:09,318 --> 00:18:14,228
We, we need to update this
usually take a couple of minutes

251
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:16,328
or seconds to update.

252
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:21,378
So I have my session host
and my connection to a

253
00:18:21,378 --> 00:18:22,788
computer in the environment.

254
00:18:22,788 --> 00:18:28,948
Let's say I allow these are RDP
configuration, so I can, by default,

255
00:18:28,968 --> 00:18:34,348
for example, block, copy and paste,
they use the clipboard, so I cannot use

256
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:38,881
the clipboard on the environment or my
personal clipboard in the environment.

257
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:44,547
And while this is happening, because it's
the first start, take a couple of seconds,

258
00:18:44,547 --> 00:18:47,569
let's see the first part of the code.

259
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:53,679
the first part of the code, I
define where I will storage my,

260
00:18:54,209 --> 00:18:57,579
my, my Terraform state file.

261
00:18:57,649 --> 00:19:00,439
I store it locally, and we have it here.

262
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:05,429
This is our file, our Terraform
state file is here, as you

263
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:08,419
can see, and we can, we know.

264
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:09,399
All day.

265
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:13,684
And if we see the file will
tell us what they create and

266
00:19:13,684 --> 00:19:15,154
what we have in the environment.

267
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:21,234
So in our main file, we have first,
I have a comment to remember, work on

268
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:23,864
how to connect to the Terraform file.

269
00:19:24,184 --> 00:19:28,944
I create a module, and this
module is, using my source call,

270
00:19:28,944 --> 00:19:31,514
my, my provider that I create.

271
00:19:31,514 --> 00:19:35,714
What is the version I define the
users that will use the terra.

272
00:19:36,214 --> 00:19:39,280
The visual, virtual Dexel environment.

273
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:43,530
I define some variables to make
it more related to the event.

274
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,930
I define how many
computers I want to create.

275
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,620
I create two computers in
this Terraform environment.

276
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,630
And what is the tenant ID and what
is the subscription ID that I'm using

277
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,305
because my user have two computers.

278
00:19:57,565 --> 00:20:03,296
A lot of secretion, and then I
hope I use a lot of them and I need

279
00:20:03,326 --> 00:20:05,746
to create a registration token.

280
00:20:05,826 --> 00:20:11,816
I need to create this value and
one requirement shouldn't be more

281
00:20:11,856 --> 00:20:14,106
than one month and less than a day.

282
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:18,161
It's the period of time that
I can create the registration

283
00:20:18,161 --> 00:20:20,111
token and those variables.

284
00:20:20,171 --> 00:20:24,011
I define the variables, the my
tenant ID and my subscription id.

285
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:30,456
This is all that I need locally and when
I run telephone in it, Terraform will read

286
00:20:30,456 --> 00:20:37,551
this and will download all the information
that I need to create my environment.

287
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:41,721
So I have here, this is the
module that I use, to run.

288
00:20:42,221 --> 00:20:46,991
The creation of the Terraform, I will
show you the configuration of the files.

289
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:52,941
Before that, I would like to show you
our Windows environment already created.

290
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:57,761
And I, in one of the
hosts, let me show you.

291
00:20:58,261 --> 00:21:00,171
In which hole I am connected.

292
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:02,541
So I am connected in the first hole.

293
00:21:02,571 --> 00:21:04,091
What is that first hole?

294
00:21:04,151 --> 00:21:09,990
Let's see it in the first graphically
or in the dashboard portal.

295
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,060
What I have.

296
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,900
So I update my resource group.

297
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,750
I have my new resource group
created with the resources.

298
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,700
And I have two computers.

299
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:27,060
One is called Con 42, 20 24,
2, and the other one is con 22.

300
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,390
con 42, 20 24 1.

301
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,310
I create two virtual machine.

302
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:36,650
I just need to change the number,
update the number, reduce the

303
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:40,280
number, the quantity of number,
and they will automatically.

304
00:21:40,945 --> 00:21:44,535
Increase or decrease the resources.

305
00:21:45,035 --> 00:21:49,005
I need to create a virtual
network, a network security group.

306
00:21:49,565 --> 00:21:55,635
As you can see, I don't have public IP
in this environment, so I don't use any

307
00:21:55,855 --> 00:21:58,545
direct connection to the virtual machine.

308
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:02,705
All they manage is through
the Azure Virtual Desktop.

309
00:22:03,195 --> 00:22:04,515
I have the host pool.

310
00:22:04,685 --> 00:22:07,925
Here I manage all the resources.

311
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:13,960
I can even define a scaling
plan, that is, I decide shut

312
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,990
down or, turn off the computer.

313
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,280
Here I have the different,
RDP configurations.

314
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:28,840
I can define, for example, if I want
to use the Microsoft, the micro,

315
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,300
the microphone, the camera, and.

316
00:22:32,065 --> 00:22:38,295
Also, the clipboard or the drivers of
the printer, or I can do it through

317
00:22:39,215 --> 00:22:42,685
different variables to create this result.

318
00:22:42,735 --> 00:22:48,985
And here I can see the state of my
computers or my session host connecting

319
00:22:48,985 --> 00:22:50,965
to the Azure Virtual Desktop environment.

320
00:22:51,465 --> 00:22:55,815
and here I have a user
connected, in fact, two users.

321
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:01,730
In the test, I can see which users
are connected in the environment.

322
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:08,580
This is a validation of what
is the state of that computer.

323
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,760
let's see the telephone code.

324
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:18,295
And first we create a, as I said, the
first we have to create a resource group.

325
00:23:18,505 --> 00:23:24,915
So this is the value or this is the block
to create a resource group with Terraform.

326
00:23:25,815 --> 00:23:28,055
They, we will create, um.

327
00:23:28,935 --> 00:23:35,665
network and this is one phone value I
by default define that when I create the

328
00:23:35,795 --> 00:23:38,325
virtual network will have the suffix PNET.

329
00:23:38,915 --> 00:23:40,345
I define the prefix.

330
00:23:40,395 --> 00:23:43,965
This is my prefix defined here.

331
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:50,930
But all the Sufi always will be have
and always the network acuity group.

332
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:56,840
The Sufi will be an SG, and
those are the default values.

333
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:02,060
So I always will have that, a
convention name in my infrastructure.

334
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:06,450
So we created the
networking part and then.

335
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:12,095
After that, we need to create the
azure virtual desktop environment.

336
00:24:12,505 --> 00:24:17,145
creating the azure virtual desktop
environment, I create the Workplace,

337
00:24:17,225 --> 00:24:22,905
the host pool, as you remember,
we, we had, the same configuration.

338
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:25,145
These are the custom RDP properties.

339
00:24:25,195 --> 00:24:30,075
I define it here by default in
the environment and also define

340
00:24:30,085 --> 00:24:32,325
how we call the host pool.

341
00:24:32,915 --> 00:24:39,555
They always Terraform host pool and
then, something here, always I can.

342
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,020
Customize the prefix.

343
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,640
Create the registration info that
I need for the other resources

344
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:52,140
and creating application group and
automatically I create everything

345
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,400
related to the Azure Virtual Desktop.

346
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:59,980
So after I create that, I
will create the session host.

347
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:05,410
I take the registration token, but
I create the network interface.

348
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:10,975
Because I decide create two
machine, they will use, a loop here.

349
00:25:10,975 --> 00:25:17,925
So we're creating two network interface,
and then we're creating two VMs and

350
00:25:18,165 --> 00:25:26,175
also with their OS disk, and this
is the fun part first, I need to.

351
00:25:26,995 --> 00:25:32,305
Make that those computers authenticated
with enter ID authentication.

352
00:25:32,515 --> 00:25:35,905
So I, this is the
configuration to achieve that.

353
00:25:35,995 --> 00:25:36,895
And why is that?

354
00:25:37,165 --> 00:25:43,505
Because Azure, Beto only will work
if we have a active director, domain

355
00:25:43,505 --> 00:25:45,455
service authentication, the computer.

356
00:25:45,605 --> 00:25:49,235
So we have to join to the domain,
those computer, or if we are

357
00:25:49,235 --> 00:25:53,755
using, enter the authentication
for my demo purpose, I will.

358
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:59,470
Don't create a directory domain service,
but I use the Enter ID authentication.

359
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:05,600
So first, I force the compute that
those session hosts, I force them to

360
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:12,430
use a Enter ID as an authentication,
as a domain controller, quote unquote.

361
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:20,280
And then I will register those computers,
those virtual machines in the environment.

362
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:25,770
As you can see, also, always I have the
count, so if I define two computers,

363
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,870
they will create this block two times.

364
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,180
And they will use in the computer
because this is the structure

365
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:37,110
of the idea of the computers.

366
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:42,160
And with this script, I add the
computer to the environment.

367
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,760
And because the security is important.

368
00:26:45,555 --> 00:26:52,325
I extract the information of the user,
I create a security group and I add

369
00:26:52,325 --> 00:26:57,135
the minimum roles that those users
need to use Azure Virtual Desktop.

370
00:26:57,555 --> 00:26:59,935
I don't give them any other roles.

371
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:04,625
I don't have to be always asking
which role need the user to connect.

372
00:27:04,885 --> 00:27:07,275
I know they need desktop
user virtualization.

373
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:08,746
and in the application group.

374
00:27:08,966 --> 00:27:15,696
And they will need a virtual machine
user login in the session host.

375
00:27:16,076 --> 00:27:18,886
Always I will be complying
that configuration.

376
00:27:19,386 --> 00:27:19,456
Ow!

377
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:25,796
If you remember, we already are in
the environment, but I will show you

378
00:27:25,826 --> 00:27:29,126
what happens when we have an incident.

379
00:27:29,146 --> 00:27:35,046
Let's say, for any reason,
the computer fails.

380
00:27:35,546 --> 00:27:38,736
I stop, let's say, the computer fails.

381
00:27:39,556 --> 00:27:44,126
we come back to our
environment, and we will wait.

382
00:27:45,126 --> 00:27:49,176
A few seconds, and we have an error.

383
00:27:49,236 --> 00:27:51,396
We disconnected to the computer.

384
00:27:51,856 --> 00:27:54,776
For some reason, we lose
the connection to that host.

385
00:27:55,146 --> 00:27:59,556
I just refresh the screen
and try to connect again.

386
00:27:59,836 --> 00:28:01,836
Let's see if we can.

387
00:28:01,856 --> 00:28:06,666
We already lost one host, but
we have a second host running.

388
00:28:07,066 --> 00:28:07,726
We log in.

389
00:28:08,226 --> 00:28:14,306
And because this host is new, it will
be making the login process again,

390
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:21,156
but as you can see, I have access
again to my virtual environment, even

391
00:28:21,206 --> 00:28:24,066
if I lose a computer for any reason.

392
00:28:24,796 --> 00:28:30,736
The computer failed, crashed, any reason,
I automatically have a secondary host

393
00:28:30,886 --> 00:28:36,706
where I can work and continue doing
my process or my daily activities.

394
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:42,496
if we come back here, we can
see, let's enter in the computer.

395
00:28:42,996 --> 00:28:46,246
This is the virtual machine
that we just shut down.

396
00:28:46,486 --> 00:28:48,896
As you can see, the computer is shut down.

397
00:28:49,246 --> 00:28:56,166
And if we go to the Azure virtual desktop
environment and refresh the screen, we see

398
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:58,296
that we have one host that has a screen.

399
00:28:58,796 --> 00:29:03,486
We don't know what it was, but we
know that we have a host with a

400
00:29:03,486 --> 00:29:10,316
problem, but our user could connect
to the new host without any problem.

401
00:29:10,566 --> 00:29:13,596
Let's prove that we have
in the secondary host.

402
00:29:14,096 --> 00:29:16,616
As you can see, I am the host number two.

403
00:29:17,096 --> 00:29:21,371
So what's relative fast,
transparent to the user.

404
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:27,096
And we can continue doing
our daily activities.

405
00:29:27,656 --> 00:29:30,036
Let me run again the VM.

406
00:29:30,536 --> 00:29:33,656
This will take a couple of minutes.

407
00:29:33,876 --> 00:29:38,986
Start the VM and then in a
few minutes, we'll be seeing

408
00:29:39,356 --> 00:29:40,996
everything is running okay.

409
00:29:41,496 --> 00:29:47,136
As you can see, Azure Virtual Desktop
can help us in our deployments, in our

410
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:53,195
tests, I just show you a way to create
Azure Virtual Desktop environment,

411
00:29:53,196 --> 00:29:58,946
can help the developers, can help the
teams, but we can do it also for Azure.

412
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:02,401
Other resources are using telephone.

413
00:30:02,421 --> 00:30:08,421
We can deploy environments,
complete environments with a code.

414
00:30:08,521 --> 00:30:14,011
And also we will have a, the security
layer that we need in our environment.

415
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:17,861
One final thought, there is
a complete certification.

416
00:30:18,556 --> 00:30:24,825
Related to Azure Virtual
Desktop is the Exang AC 140.

417
00:30:24,826 --> 00:30:27,306
It's all related to Azure Virtual Desktop.

418
00:30:27,366 --> 00:30:32,526
Also, there is the Terraform
certification that you can execute it.

419
00:30:32,616 --> 00:30:39,576
And, of course, Use the Microsoft
MVP Forum Stack Overflow to ask

420
00:30:39,576 --> 00:30:41,126
questions if you have any issue.

421
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:43,986
I asked a lot of questions
to complete this code.

422
00:30:44,456 --> 00:30:49,346
I asked a lot of questions
in those forums a while ago.

423
00:30:49,736 --> 00:30:51,786
you can find me in LinkedIn.

424
00:30:51,786 --> 00:30:53,276
I'm Solis Carlos.

425
00:30:53,296 --> 00:30:59,285
Please, if you will look for my
complete name, use Carlos Solis Salazar.

426
00:30:59,336 --> 00:31:02,156
to finish or close our.

427
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,776
our life cycle of Terraform.

428
00:31:05,086 --> 00:31:10,746
Let's see, for example, let's see
again, if we recover our host, I

429
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:13,546
don't see it anymore as a failed host.

430
00:31:13,986 --> 00:31:18,426
I see, okay, here, maybe I have to wait.

431
00:31:18,926 --> 00:31:21,536
Ah, as you can see, we
already have the host.

432
00:31:22,036 --> 00:31:28,496
So let's now the final step is
Terraform destroyed environment.

433
00:31:28,996 --> 00:31:30,926
This will take again.

434
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:35,606
We'll read everything that we have
in our Terraform state file in our

435
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:40,026
environment and in our configuration,
and we'll define what we have to

436
00:31:40,026 --> 00:31:41,356
do to destroy the environment.

437
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:46,526
As you can see, we'll destroy
everything that we created, computers,

438
00:31:46,526 --> 00:31:52,008
and, The different computers and
network interface and this, and the

439
00:31:52,008 --> 00:31:56,978
extension that we use to, to, you,
to join the computer to enter ID.

440
00:31:57,178 --> 00:32:03,103
and, It will destroy practically
everything we created, and we just have

441
00:32:03,103 --> 00:32:06,713
to approve the destruction, and that's it.

442
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:07,903
That's it.

443
00:32:07,943 --> 00:32:11,793
The process will take a couple
of minutes, but at the end, you

444
00:32:11,793 --> 00:32:15,613
can be sure that everything will
be destroyed, and that's it.

445
00:32:15,883 --> 00:32:20,773
We just use a little
bit our Azure created.

446
00:32:20,993 --> 00:32:23,613
I hope everything, was nice.

447
00:32:23,663 --> 00:32:29,763
And if you have any question, please don't
hesitate ask me in any social network.
