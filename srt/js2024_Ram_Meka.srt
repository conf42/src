AI in dialysis healthcare landscape.

24
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,129
Let's look into a little
bit of background.

25
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:38,910
Dialysis is a vital medical intervention
designed to substitute the renal functions

26
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,160
of failing kidneys, serving as a critical
treatment for patients with end stage

27
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,510
renal disease, a condition that impacts
millions of individuals globally.

28
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:53,090
Although dialysis is an essential
life sustaining procedure, it is

29
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,090
accompanied by considerable challenges.

30
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,020
including issues related to the treatment
adherence, potential complications,

31
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,680
and the high costs associated
with the healthcare technology.

32
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,010
Let's look into the role of technology.

33
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:09,009
In recent years, the integration
of technology into healthcare has

34

00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:22,655
JavaScript, a robust programming
language, Predominantly utilized for web

37
00:02:22,655 --> 00:02:27,675
development has emerged as an essential
tool for creating interactive applications

38
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:32,725
that promote effective data management
and foster the patient engagement.

39
00:02:33,225 --> 00:02:36,685
Let's try to understand the real
dialysis care a little bit more.

40
00:02:37,185 --> 00:02:40,825
Dialysis is a critical medical
procedure that replicates the essential

41
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:44,695
functions of the kidneys when they
are unable to perform effectively.

42
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:49,595
There are two primary modalities of
dialysis, which are the hemodialysis

43
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:50,835
and the peritoneal dialysis.

44
00:02:51,785 --> 00:02:56,105
Each method employs a different
and distinct technique and carries

45
00:02:56,105 --> 00:02:59,515
different implications for patient
management and the outcomes.

46
00:03:00,015 --> 00:03:04,715
Now let's shed a little bit of light on
what are the challenges in dialysis care.

47
00:03:05,215 --> 00:03:09,325
Despite its life sustaining
capabilities, dialysis care is

48
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,115
fraught with numerous challenges.

49
00:03:11,735 --> 00:03:14,435
Some of them being the
complex treatment protocols.

50
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:18,515
Patients typically undergo dialysis
sessions three times per week.

51
00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:22,845
which necessitates intricate
logistical arrangements and

52
00:03:22,855 --> 00:03:24,385
considerable time commitments.

53
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:25,945
The complications.

54
00:03:26,645 --> 00:03:30,355
Patients face various risks, including
cardiovascular complications,

55
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:35,815
infections, and anemia, all of which can
profoundly affect their quality of life.

56
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:38,235
And the last one, the healthcare costs.

57
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:42,795
The financial implications of dialysis
care are significant, encompassing

58
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:46,965
expenses related to equipment,
medications, and healthcare personnel.

59
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:51,235
which contribute to a substantial
economic burden on patients

60
00:03:51,255 --> 00:03:52,915
and also the healthcare system.

61
00:03:53,415 --> 00:03:56,725
Now let's dive into the role of
JavaScript in healthcare technology.

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,860
JavaScript facilitates the creation
of intuitive user interfaces that

81
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,110
foster improved patient engagement
and enhance communication between the

82
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,370
patients and the healthcare providers,
ultimately contributing to a more

83
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,940
effective healthcare experience.

84
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,240
Now let's look at the AI
and the predictive analytics

85
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,340
in dialysis healthcare.

86
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,540

Ensuring compliance with regulations
such as the Health Insurance Portability

162
00:09:54,284 --> 00:09:59,594
and Accountability Act, also commonly
referred to as HIPAA, is imperative for

163
00:09:59,594 --> 00:10:03,764
safeguarding patient confidentiality and
maintaining trust in healthcare systems.

164
00:10:04,264 --> 00:10:05,784
The implementation barriers.

165
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:11,319
The adoption of new technologies may face
resistance from both health care providers

166
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:16,709
and patients to facilitate a seamless
transition to new systems, comprehensive

167
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:18,269
training and education are essential.

168
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:23,209
These initiatives can help mitigate
apprehensions and ensure that all the

169
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:27,459

These advancements will enhance
the precision and efficacy of

184
00:11:19,849 --> 00:11:21,439
clinical decision making processes.

185
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:26,459
And the expansion of telehealth services,
the growing acceptance and the utilization

186
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:30,709
of telehealth solutions are expected
to facilitate the emergence of more

187
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:33,099
comprehensive and integrated care models.

188
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:38,539
This expansion will significantly enhance
access to the dialysis care for patients

189
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:41,149
in remote or undeserved underserved areas.

190
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:46,289
Thereby improving the health equity
and outcomes, the collaborative

191
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:51,299
approaches, the future of dialysis
healthcare is likely to involve

192
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:55,839
enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration
among healthcare providers, the data

193
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,869
scientists and technology developers.

194
00:11:58,869 --> 00:12:01,664
This cooperative approach will
foster the certain outcomes.

195
00:12:02,034 --> 00:12:07,234
Creation of innovative solutions that are
specifically tailored to meet the diverse

196
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:12,624
needs of patients, ultimately advancing
the quality of care in dialysis landscape.

197
00:12:13,124 --> 00:12:16,714
With all that said, the integration
of JavaScript and the artificial

198
00:12:16,714 --> 00:12:21,034
intelligence within the realm of dialysis
healthcare presents a substantial

199
00:12:21,384 --> 00:12:25,324
opportunity to enhance both patient
care and the operational efficiencies.

200
00:12:25,824 --> 00:12:28,614
By utilizing predictive analytics
and personalized treatment

201
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:32,344
strategies, healthcare providers
can significantly improve clinical

202
00:12:32,364 --> 00:12:36,124
outcomes for patients suffering
from the end stage renal diseases.

203
00:12:36,624 --> 00:12:40,224
As the healthcare landscape continues
to evolve, the potential for these

204
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:44,694
technologies to revolutionize the
dialysis care, remains highly promising.

205
00:12:45,194 --> 00:12:49,474
To fully harness the benefits of this
technological advancement, ongoing

206
00:12:49,494 --> 00:12:53,664
