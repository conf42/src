1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,120
Yes.

2
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,780
Hello all.

3
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,800
So before we begin, I have
a quick disclaimer here.

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,820
I would like to clarify that
this presentation is based on my

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,560
personal research and insights.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,490
I am in no way speaking on behalf of
Amazon Web Services, and the views

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,920
expressed here are solely my own.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,340
The stock is independent of my role at AWS
and is focused on exploring how blockchain

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,840
can enhance incident management.

10
00:00:28,335 --> 00:00:29,865
Thank you all for joining today.

11
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:32,284
today to me at Con 4 42.

12
00:00:32,785 --> 00:00:37,585
I'm Ju Sal and I'm excited to share my
insights on how blockchain is changing

13
00:00:37,585 --> 00:00:39,595
the way we handle incident management.

14
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:45,334
In my current role at Amazon Web Services,
I focus on solving complex problems

15
00:00:45,334 --> 00:00:48,034
related to large scale system incidents.

16
00:00:48,534 --> 00:00:54,414
Through this experience, I have seen first
firsthand the challenges that come with

17
00:00:54,414 --> 00:00:57,234
managing security and operational risk.

18
00:00:58,014 --> 00:01:03,684
so this presentation today explores
how blockchain can make these processes

19
00:01:04,184 --> 00:01:06,614
more secure, efficient, and transparent.

20
00:01:07,094 --> 00:01:12,404
So before we, before we begin, you
will, notice a QR code on this slide.

21
00:01:13,169 --> 00:01:17,524
So you can justcan it and visit my
portfolio and connect with me later.

22
00:01:18,484 --> 00:01:20,244
Now, let's get started.

23
00:01:20,744 --> 00:01:25,230
our, uh, now to set the stage, we'll
first, look at the difficulties faced

24
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,940
in existing incident management.

25
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,475
Then we will ex. Blur how blockchain helps
solve this problems and how different

26
00:01:33,565 --> 00:01:35,575
industries are applying this approach.

27
00:01:36,325 --> 00:01:41,775
From there, we will break down its impact
on the security audits and compliance.

28
00:01:42,275 --> 00:01:47,285
We will also look at a case study
showing real world results and

29
00:01:47,285 --> 00:01:51,565
wrap up with challenges, future
possibilities, and key takeaways.

30
00:01:52,065 --> 00:01:53,296
With all of that in mind.

31
00:01:53,796 --> 00:01:57,865
Let's get started by understanding
the struggles organizations face

32
00:01:57,865 --> 00:01:59,275
when dealing with incidents.

33
00:01:59,775 --> 00:02:04,295
it's handling incidents in, modern
businesses is far from simple.

34
00:02:04,795 --> 00:02:09,165
With rapid dig or digital growth,
companies are dealing with more

35
00:02:09,165 --> 00:02:10,600
connected systems than ever.

36
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,680
So this increases risks.

37
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,050
Can get harder to track and
respond to security events.

38
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:23,290
So traditional methods, rely on central
databases, which can be altered, delayed,

39
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:29,070
or even, lost in the critical moments
as businesses and across regions.

40
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,380
managing incidents across multiple,
locations becomes even harder.

41
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,050
So this is where blockchain
comes into picture.

42
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,750
By offering a way to seek Howly
record and share information without

43
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,821
a central authority, it changes how
we approach event, security events.

44
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,500
Let's take a closer
look at how this works.

45
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,100
at its core,

46
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,780
blockchain provides a shared record that.

47
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,555
No single person or company can alter.

48
00:02:56,915 --> 00:03:02,315
So this is done through a system that
records every action in a way that

49
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,645
ensures honesty and accuracy Another.

50
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:08,035
Q benefit is automation.

51
00:03:08,245 --> 00:03:10,255
S smart contracts.

52
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,875
All self running programs help
trigger responses automatically,

53
00:03:14,305 --> 00:03:17,085
reducing delays and human errors.

54
00:03:17,295 --> 00:03:21,095
So these features make
blockchain a strong option for.

55
00:03:21,595 --> 00:03:26,695
For ending, security events, especially
in industries where reliability and

56
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:29,965
trust, are at utmost importance.

57
00:03:30,595 --> 00:03:34,185
But what makes it, truly
unique is its ability to create

58
00:03:34,185 --> 00:03:35,775
records that cannot be changed.

59
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:37,575
So let's explore that next.

60
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:41,605
so one of the, one of the
biggest concerns in incident.

61
00:03:42,535 --> 00:03:45,025
Handling is proving of
what really happened.

62
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:50,775
So records can be altered,
deleted, or manipulated, leading

63
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:52,755
to disputes and compliance issues.

64
00:03:53,475 --> 00:03:59,225
Blockchain eliminates this risk by keeping
an unchangeable record, so each event is

65
00:03:59,225 --> 00:04:05,065
stored in a way that, that no one can edit
or remove, ensuring full accountability.

66
00:04:05,065 --> 00:04:07,585
So this feature is not just useful.

67
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:13,460
it's essential for industries that require
accurate records such as finance and

68
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:18,370
healthcare, but security is about more
than just keeping the records intact.

69
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,800
It also means making sure only the
right people have access to it.

70
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,330
So let's move on to that.

71
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,495
Power system is one that keeps.

72
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:32,360
Helps out unauthorized users while
giving the right people easy access.

73
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,010
So blockchain does this in three key ways.

74
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:42,220
First, it, it uses encryption to make
sure data is protected at all times.

75
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:48,275
Second, access is controlled using smart
contracts, which grants permissions

76
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:50,375
automatically based on rules.

77
00:04:50,945 --> 00:04:55,435
Oh, finally, blockchain both follows
a security model where every action is

78
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:59,815
checked before it is allowed, making
unauthorized access nearly impossible.

79
00:05:00,535 --> 00:05:05,905
So this security benefits help
organizations gain trust and reduce risk.

80
00:05:06,235 --> 00:05:08,790
But another, major
concern of this business.

81
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,381
Of this business is, of following
the government and industry rules.

82
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:14,156
So that's what we will discuss next.

83
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:19,216
F for many businesses out there,
following rules is just as

84
00:05:19,216 --> 00:05:20,836
important as protecting data.

85
00:05:20,836 --> 00:05:23,656
So mistakes can lead to
fines or legal trouble.

86
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:29,006
this is where, blockchain makes compliance
easier by, by actually creating the

87
00:05:29,006 --> 00:05:33,736
records that are always accurate and
available for review, automated tracking

88
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:38,351
and ensures that every action is logged,
reducing the need for manual reports.

89
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:39,791
Okay, so this helps.

90
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:43,831
This helps business prove they
are following rules without

91
00:05:43,831 --> 00:05:46,441
spending extra time or effort.

92
00:05:46,941 --> 00:05:50,741
But how do we make sure that the
system itself is working correctly?

93
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:52,471
that's where audits come in.

94
00:05:52,861 --> 00:05:54,691
So our well structured.

95
00:05:55,191 --> 00:05:58,071
System needs, regular
checks to stay reliable.

96
00:05:58,431 --> 00:06:00,981
blockchain auditing is done in four ways.

97
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:05,871
First, there is only ongoing
improvement where security measures

98
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:08,451
are updated based on new threats.

99
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:12,771
Second, there's a compliance
verification to make sure

100
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:14,301
industry rules are being backed.

101
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:17,741
Third, the system's daily operations are.

102
00:06:18,146 --> 00:06:20,726
are reviewed to check for inefficiencies.

103
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:23,876
And finally, the technology
itself is tested for weeks.

104
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:27,366
So by following this process,
organizations can ensure

105
00:06:27,426 --> 00:06:30,996
that our blockchain setup is
always working, is expected.

106
00:06:31,496 --> 00:06:35,516
now let's see how different
industries are applying these ideas.

107
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:40,816
Companies in finance, healthcare,
and security are adopting, adopting,

108
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:42,876
blockchain, rapidly than others.

109
00:06:43,146 --> 00:06:47,766
So, although banks, we use it to
track transactions without risk

110
00:06:47,766 --> 00:06:52,206
of fraud, hospitals rely on it
to keep patient records safe.

111
00:06:52,696 --> 00:06:56,836
security of firms use it to
monitor threats in real time.

112
00:06:57,811 --> 00:07:05,051
Each of these industries, benefits in, in,
in its own ways, but they are all, share.

113
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:11,126
but they all share a need for,
reliable and care systems to understand

114
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:16,896
our, understand blockchains, really
impact, let's actually, go through,

115
00:07:17,226 --> 00:07:18,906
Go through a real world case study.

116
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:23,476
uh, large financial companies
struggled with slow response

117
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,826
times and our data tracking.

118
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:32,976
So before blockchain, resolving
an issue took almost two days.

119
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:37,911
So after switching to blockchain, this
dropped by 72% compliance reporting,

120
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:39,891
which was manual and time consuming.

121
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:43,946
It's also, also, became 89% faster.

122
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:48,966
So this case proves that blockchain
is not just an idea, it actually

123
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:50,946
delivers measurable improvements.

124
00:07:51,486 --> 00:07:53,846
However, No system is perfect.

125
00:07:53,846 --> 00:07:57,866
So let's discuss some challenges that
come with adopting this technology.

126
00:07:58,366 --> 00:08:03,996
Oh, so while, so while blockchain
has, its, has its clear benefits, it

127
00:08:03,996 --> 00:08:10,186
also comes with some, hurdles, setting
up a new system requires investment

128
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:12,496
training and a shift in company culture.

129
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,266
Indeed.

130
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:18,106
Creating blockchain with older
systems is another challenge.

131
00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:22,716
So despite these obstacles, businesses
are finding ways to overcome them

132
00:08:22,716 --> 00:08:24,756
by starting small and scaling up.

133
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:30,517
and then, and then looking ahead, let's
see, let's see, no where the, where

134
00:08:30,522 --> 00:08:32,946
this blockchain is headed in the future.

135
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:37,016
So blockchain is evolving
alongside artificial intelligence

136
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,186
and connected devices.

137
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:44,881
all, all together, these technologies
will help, predict problems before

138
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:49,811
they happen and ultimate response, but
even further, and the will, the future.

139
00:08:50,271 --> 00:08:53,421
research will focus on, on
making blockchain easier

140
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:55,431
to use and more adaptable.

141
00:08:55,941 --> 00:09:00,231
Organizations that start using it
now will be in a strong position.

142
00:09:00,731 --> 00:09:02,711
As these advancements unfolded.

143
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:06,621
so this, this brings us
to end of this session.

144
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:13,066
I share all of your time and interest if
you'd like to explore this ideas further.

145
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:16,936
scan this QR code and
then connect with me.

146
00:09:16,936 --> 00:09:19,926
I look for, to hearing, hearing
your thoughts and answers.

147
00:09:20,871 --> 00:09:24,591
and answering any of your, any
further questions that you have.

148
00:09:25,221 --> 00:09:27,981
So thank you again and have a great day.

149
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:28,551
Bye-bye.
