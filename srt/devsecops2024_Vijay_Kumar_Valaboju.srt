00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,239
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:03,480
My name is Vijay Kumar Vallabhoju.

3
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:07,280
Welcome to DevSecOps 2024 event.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,769
I'm going to talk about reinforcement
learning in AI driven assessment

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,019
and how this enhances continuous
learning and accessibility.

6
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:17,479
Let's get started.

7
00:00:18,814 --> 00:00:22,954
Traditional education has long
been criticized for its rigidity,

8
00:00:23,454 --> 00:00:28,394
offering a one size fits all approach
that often falls short in meeting

9
00:00:28,874 --> 00:00:30,744
the unique needs of every learner.

10
00:00:31,294 --> 00:00:35,354
this lack of flexibility and
personalization can limit

11
00:00:35,394 --> 00:00:38,564
engagement and learning outcomes.

12
00:00:39,064 --> 00:00:45,604
This is where reinforcement learning
or RL steps in as a game changer.

13
00:00:46,104 --> 00:00:52,654
RL brings adaptability to education by
personalizing content and assessment in

14
00:00:52,654 --> 00:00:57,674
real time, responding to each learner's
space, preferences, and progress.

15
00:00:58,174 --> 00:01:01,865
Let's look at some of the key
contributions RL makes to education.

16
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:02,635
All right.

17
00:01:03,335 --> 00:01:07,944
first is, it enables, dynamic, tailored,
learning tailored to individuals.

18
00:01:08,684 --> 00:01:13,874
What it means is Each learner gets a
custom experience that evolves based

19
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:15,614
on their interactions and performance.

20
00:01:16,114 --> 00:01:18,914
Second, it provides continuous feedback.

21
00:01:19,424 --> 00:01:23,674
Instead of waiting for traditional
assessment cycles, learners can receive

22
00:01:23,754 --> 00:01:29,414
immediate insights, helping them develop
skills more effectively and efficiently.

23
00:01:29,914 --> 00:01:35,994
And third, RL optimizes knowledge
retention over time by reinforcing the

24
00:01:35,994 --> 00:01:37,864
right concepts at the right intervals.

25
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:42,554
This approach ensures that
learning isn't just short term,

26
00:01:42,564 --> 00:01:44,724
but meaningful and long lasting.

27
00:01:45,224 --> 00:01:50,754
in short, RL doesn't just enhance
learning, it transforms it, making

28
00:01:50,754 --> 00:01:55,294
it more engaging, effective, and
tailored to individual needs.

29
00:01:55,794 --> 00:01:57,684
Let's look at how RL works.

30
00:01:58,234 --> 00:02:04,724
RL, this explore, explore, In context of
education, RL operates on a set of core

31
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:10,434
concepts that work together seamlessly
to personalize the learning experience.

32
00:02:10,934 --> 00:02:12,484
Let me break it down for you, all right?

33
00:02:12,904 --> 00:02:14,854
First, there is an agent.

34
00:02:15,354 --> 00:02:19,614
This is an AI system that continuously
analyzes the learner's performance,

35
00:02:20,094 --> 00:02:23,904
keeping track of their progress, and
identifies the areas of improvement.

36
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:26,014
Next, we have the environment.

37
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:29,314
Think of this as learner's
knowledge state and their

38
00:02:29,324 --> 00:02:32,044
individual preferences, essentially.

39
00:02:32,544 --> 00:02:35,954
The current understanding and context
that system operates within, right?

40
00:02:35,994 --> 00:02:37,754
This is the environment
we're talking about.

41
00:02:38,674 --> 00:02:39,944
Then there are actions.

42
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:45,024
These are specific adjustments the
AI makes, such as modifying the

43
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:49,954
content, tailoring the assessments,
or even reshaping the entire learning

44
00:02:49,954 --> 00:02:52,994
path to suit to the learner's needs.

45
00:02:53,494 --> 00:02:55,034
Now, finally, the rewards.

46
00:02:55,974 --> 00:02:58,974
This is where positive
reinforcement comes into play.

47
00:02:59,684 --> 00:03:03,824
The system rewards progress by
encouraging the learner through

48
00:03:03,824 --> 00:03:05,814
well timed feedback and recognition.

49
00:03:06,714 --> 00:03:10,084
Now, this helps maintain the
motivation and focus for a learner.

50
00:03:10,584 --> 00:03:13,044
So how does this look into action, right?

51
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:14,654
Here is a quick example.

52
00:03:15,604 --> 00:03:20,174
Now, reinforcement learning system
observes a learner, interacts with the,

53
00:03:20,254 --> 00:03:21,984
how a learner interacts with the content.

54
00:03:22,484 --> 00:03:27,024
Now, based on this interaction, it
dynamically adjusts, and the feedback

55
00:03:27,034 --> 00:03:28,904
and challenges the learner receives.

56
00:03:29,754 --> 00:03:34,174
If learner struggles, the
system simplifies the material

57
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:35,954
or offer, offer hints.

58
00:03:36,894 --> 00:03:41,474
If they excel, it introduces more
complex challenges to keep them engaged.

59
00:03:42,214 --> 00:03:46,694
Now, this real time adaptability
not only enhances the learner's

60
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:51,799
experience, but ensures it evolves
alongside learner's progress.

61
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:56,779
It's a dynamic process designed to
empower learners and optimize outcomes.

62
00:03:57,279 --> 00:04:02,139
Okay, let's look into the key features
of RL based, adaptive learning.

63
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,299
Reinforcement learning based
adaptive learning systems bring

64
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:08,389
a range of powerful features.

65
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:12,819
this actually makes the education more
engaging, personalized, and effective.

66
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,259
Let's explore some of
the, some of them, right?

67
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:18,059
First, we have dynamic
curriculum adjustment.

68
00:04:18,914 --> 00:04:21,864
this feature tracks a learner's
performance and adjusts

69
00:04:21,864 --> 00:04:23,284
the content accordingly.

70
00:04:24,214 --> 00:04:30,124
For example, it strengthens weak areas
by revisiting foundational topics

71
00:04:30,364 --> 00:04:35,304
while simultaneously advancing topics
where the learner is already strong.

72
00:04:35,804 --> 00:04:40,214
Now, this ensures that no time is
wasted on written and material, right?

73
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:43,054
next is, real time difficulty adjustment.

74
00:04:43,554 --> 00:04:46,984
The system modifies difficulty
of questions based on how

75
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:48,914
the learner responds, right?

76
00:04:49,254 --> 00:04:53,544
If a learner struggles, the questions
become easier or to build confidence.

77
00:04:54,054 --> 00:04:57,014
If they excel, the system
challenges them with more harder

78
00:04:57,014 --> 00:04:58,664
questions to keep them engaged.

79
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:01,294
And then we have personalized feedback.

80
00:05:02,204 --> 00:05:04,704
Now this is unlike, generic responses.

81
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:10,784
this system provides detailed explanations
for incorrect answers while helping

82
00:05:10,784 --> 00:05:14,844
learners understand their mistakes
for, mistakes and grow from them.

83
00:05:15,344 --> 00:05:18,124
another exciting feature
is, gamification element.

84
00:05:18,624 --> 00:05:23,814
Learners earn rewards like badges,
points, or levels for their progress,

85
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:28,994
which boosts engagement and motivation,
by turning learning into a more

86
00:05:29,014 --> 00:05:31,344
enjoyable and rewarding experience.

87
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,944
And then finally, we have
cognitive load management.

88
00:05:35,444 --> 00:05:38,664
And what this is, this is
crucial for preventing burnout.

89
00:05:39,164 --> 00:05:43,254
By alternating between different
types of tasks and simultaneous,

90
00:05:43,294 --> 00:05:48,794
strategically introducing breaks, the
system, ensures that, learner remain

91
00:05:48,814 --> 00:05:51,294
focused and don't feel overwhelmed.

92
00:05:51,794 --> 00:05:55,964
together, all these features make
RL based adaptive learning systems

93
00:05:56,044 --> 00:06:00,754
not just a tool for education, but a
transformative experience that aligns

94
00:06:00,754 --> 00:06:02,404
with individual needs and goals.

95
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:03,704
Let's move on.

96
00:06:04,204 --> 00:06:04,524
Okay.

97
00:06:05,024 --> 00:06:07,484
Let's look at some, real
world applications, right?

98
00:06:07,984 --> 00:06:12,114
Reinforcement learning has far
reaching applications across

99
00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:14,084
various, learning domains.

100
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:17,324
here are a few examples that
I've covered in here, right?

101
00:06:17,394 --> 00:06:21,374
in higher education, reinforcement
learning enables adaptive exams.

102
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:27,854
These exams dynamically adjust their
difficulty, ensuring evaluation

103
00:06:28,564 --> 00:06:30,194
are both fair and accurate.

104
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:34,194
This is tailored to each
student's progress and abilities.

105
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,614
And when it comes to professional
certifications, right?

106
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:44,384
professional certifications RL focuses
on weak areas during exam preparation

107
00:06:44,724 --> 00:06:46,954
by prioritizing these topics.

108
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:51,924
It ensures efficient learning and
focused learning which actually

109
00:06:52,294 --> 00:06:54,124
maximizes the chances of success.

110
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:58,224
When it comes to corporate training,
In corporate training, RL aligns

111
00:06:58,494 --> 00:07:01,924
learning modules with, with the
organizational goals, right?

112
00:07:02,614 --> 00:07:06,064
this is the most common
challenging part when it comes

113
00:07:06,064 --> 00:07:07,364
to a corporate training part.

114
00:07:07,414 --> 00:07:12,274
Most of the times, things don't align
with the organizational goals and they

115
00:07:12,484 --> 00:07:18,014
try to deviate, which actually makes
the, people who are the actual learners.

116
00:07:18,844 --> 00:07:22,544
Deviate from the real organizational
goal and move on to something else.

117
00:07:22,764 --> 00:07:31,514
And further, decreasing in the engagement
or getting, the, staying relevant to what,

118
00:07:31,614 --> 00:07:37,054
so what is important for the organization
and that way remain productive.

119
00:07:37,554 --> 00:07:42,224
Now, finally, in language learning,
RL uses adaptive difficulty to help

120
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:45,784
learners master grammar, and vocabulary.

121
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:51,244
It keeps challenges, at just the
right level to maintain engagement

122
00:07:51,274 --> 00:07:52,564
and promote steady progress.

123
00:07:53,064 --> 00:07:57,074
across all these areas, RL personalizes
learning experiences, making them

124
00:07:57,074 --> 00:08:03,244
smarter, more effective, deeply aligned
with individual or organizational needs.

125
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:04,484
Let's move on.

126
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:07,984
I've covered some case
studies in here, right?

127
00:08:08,684 --> 00:08:13,104
reinforcement learning is transforming
learning platforms by, personalizing

128
00:08:13,104 --> 00:08:14,934
the experience across different domains.

129
00:08:15,434 --> 00:08:18,084
Some of the examples are
like, math learning platform.

130
00:08:18,214 --> 00:08:19,374
Let's take this as an example.

131
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:23,684
Here, a system tracks the learner's,
progress in areas like algebra.

132
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:27,704
It provides advanced problems to
build on their strengths while

133
00:08:27,914 --> 00:08:31,824
offering extra practice in weaker
areas to ensure balance growth.

134
00:08:32,324 --> 00:08:33,764
Professional certification prep.

135
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:41,234
RL focuses, assessments on challenging
topics such as security protocols, helping

136
00:08:41,234 --> 00:08:43,214
learners overcome specific hurdles.

137
00:08:44,194 --> 00:08:48,794
It also introduces questions from
a variety of domains to maintain

138
00:08:48,824 --> 00:08:50,484
a well rounded preparation.

139
00:08:50,984 --> 00:08:55,394
When it comes to language learning
platforms, To improve skills like writing,

140
00:08:55,434 --> 00:09:00,614
the system rewards practice in weaker
areas while maintaining engagement through

141
00:09:00,614 --> 00:09:03,854
gratification and dynamic challenges.

142
00:09:04,354 --> 00:09:09,154
by adapting to these needs of each
learner, these platforms make learning

143
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:12,414
targeted, engaging, and highly effective.

144
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:13,184
Okay,

145
00:09:13,684 --> 00:09:18,754
moving further, benefits of
RL in AI driven assessment.

146
00:09:19,254 --> 00:09:22,804
Reinforcement learning in AI
driven assessment offers numerous

147
00:09:22,804 --> 00:09:27,404
benefits, that significantly
enhance, the learning experience.

148
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:32,004
If you break it down, these are some of
the things I have, brought it down here.

149
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:34,484
Personalized learning paths.

150
00:09:35,014 --> 00:09:40,424
Now, the system adapts content to
meet the unique need of each learner.

151
00:09:40,924 --> 00:09:44,144
This ensures more effective
and targeted outcomes.

152
00:09:44,644 --> 00:09:47,014
Next is increased engagement, right?

153
00:09:47,484 --> 00:09:53,754
Now, when we talk about features like
gamification, and timely feedback, this

154
00:09:53,754 --> 00:09:57,994
keeps learners motivated and actively
involved in their learning journey.

155
00:09:58,494 --> 00:09:59,464
Knowledge retention.

156
00:10:00,444 --> 00:10:07,464
Now, by using spaced, repetitive
techniques, RL ensures that learners

157
00:10:07,684 --> 00:10:09,664
retain knowledge over long term.

158
00:10:10,164 --> 00:10:13,104
rather than just the short
term assessments, right?

159
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:16,014
this is how, it increases
the knowledge retention.

160
00:10:16,514 --> 00:10:17,994
efficient skill development.

161
00:10:18,354 --> 00:10:25,274
Now, RL focuses on improving weaker
areas while reinforcing strengths, right?

162
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:32,004
Now, this helps learners develop skills
in a well rounded and efficient manner.

163
00:10:32,504 --> 00:10:33,274
Accessibility.

164
00:10:33,274 --> 00:10:39,324
When it comes to accessibility, these
systems are designed for flexibility,

165
00:10:39,964 --> 00:10:42,414
enabling learning anytime and anywhere.

166
00:10:42,914 --> 00:10:46,504
This is especially valuable today
in a fast paced and a remote

167
00:10:46,504 --> 00:10:47,874
learning environment, right?

168
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:53,724
together, these benefits make, RL based
systems a game changer in education,

169
00:10:54,374 --> 00:10:59,064
promoting deeper learning and improved
outcomes for all types of learners.

170
00:10:59,564 --> 00:11:02,824
All right, let's look at some,
challenges and limitations.

171
00:11:03,324 --> 00:11:04,334
Algorithmic bias.

172
00:11:04,534 --> 00:11:07,934
Now, the biggest challenge, I've listed
down some of the biggest challenges,

173
00:11:08,004 --> 00:11:11,694
let's be honest, there, with any
system, there will also be some certain

174
00:11:11,894 --> 00:11:13,514
challenges and limitations, right?

175
00:11:14,444 --> 00:11:16,574
And I have listed a few, right?

176
00:11:16,624 --> 00:11:21,754
the top ones are like, algorithmic
bias, RL systems must ensure fairness,

177
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,324
across diverse learners, right?

178
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:27,574
And then complexity of, human learning.

179
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:31,614
Human learning is inherently complex.

180
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:36,674
modeling individual learning path
is not, is going to be challenging.

181
00:11:36,674 --> 00:11:38,674
It's not going to be an easy thing, right?

182
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,079
data privacy and security.

183
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:44,239
Now, this one, is another
top most challenge.

184
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:45,689
protecting learner data.

185
00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:49,329
it is crucial for trust
and adoption, right?

186
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:51,099
Scalability.

187
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:57,399
now scaling RL for a larger diverse user
group needs a robust infrastructure.

188
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:01,249
Alright, moving forward,
future directions.

189
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:04,559
for future directions, I have
listed down a few of them,

190
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:06,609
integration with advanced AI.

191
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:13,509
Now, combine RL and NLP and computer
vision for, enhanced interactivity.

192
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:19,569
this increases the engagement and this
enhances the interactivity between the RL

193
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:21,599
based system and the learner, that way.

194
00:12:22,474 --> 00:12:24,404
this is going to help, help the learners.

195
00:12:25,324 --> 00:12:26,604
Improved algorithms.

196
00:12:26,754 --> 00:12:32,104
we have to evolve and keep on evolving,
from where we are to a future state.

197
00:12:32,644 --> 00:12:37,524
So whatever algorithms that we have,
we have to improve on top of it.

198
00:12:37,604 --> 00:12:43,354
This, focus on a BIOS free, interpretable,
and scalable RL system, right?

199
00:12:44,174 --> 00:12:45,909
with the focus on these areas.

200
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:45,959
Thanks.

201
00:12:46,804 --> 00:12:49,754
Global reach, the bigger the
reach, the better the systems are

202
00:12:49,754 --> 00:12:56,244
become right now, extend adaptive
learning to underserved communities.

203
00:12:56,284 --> 00:13:01,214
Basically, these are the communities
that, hardly get access to the

204
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,784
newest technologies and stuff.

205
00:13:02,794 --> 00:13:07,294
So again, calling this out
upfront, can help, provide a better

206
00:13:07,294 --> 00:13:09,654
future direction for this system.

207
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:11,294
Long term studies.

208
00:13:12,054 --> 00:13:16,464
assess impact on learning outcomes and
keep on improving from there, right?

209
00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:21,384
assess the impact, and then measure the
professional success over time, and then

210
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:26,624
keep on improving and repeat this process
over and over again to make the system

211
00:13:26,644 --> 00:13:28,754
better and better for the future periods.

212
00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:31,624
With that, I'll, I'll, Talk
about the conclusion part.

213
00:13:32,334 --> 00:13:37,974
Now, RL is, in AI driven system is
revolutionizing the education and

214
00:13:37,974 --> 00:13:39,534
professional development landscape.

215
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:43,904
By integrating dynamic, adaptive,
and personalized learning systems,

216
00:13:44,374 --> 00:13:49,664
RL enables learners to achieve their
goals more efficiently and effectively.

217
00:13:50,554 --> 00:13:53,974
Now these systems continuously
adjust learning path based

218
00:13:53,974 --> 00:13:55,394
on individual performances.

219
00:13:55,894 --> 00:14:01,234
This ensures optimal engagement, knowledge
retention, and skill acquisition.

220
00:14:01,734 --> 00:14:07,344
The flexibility offered by RL driven
platforms caters to diverse learners,

221
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:12,394
making education more accessible
and tailored to their unique needs.

222
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:17,704
The transformative power of RL
lies in its ability to provide real

223
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:23,414
time feedback, optimize long term
learning trajectories, and foster

224
00:14:23,794 --> 00:14:25,574
motivation through gamification.

225
00:14:26,184 --> 00:14:31,104
From K to 12 classrooms, to professional
certification, to corporate training, RL

226
00:14:31,154 --> 00:14:33,894
is reshaping how education is delivered.

227
00:14:34,544 --> 00:14:38,514
This, by ensuring learners
are prepared for increasingly

228
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,694
complex and competitive work.

229
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:42,484
thank you everyone.
