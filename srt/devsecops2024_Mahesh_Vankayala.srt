00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:07,320
Hello everyone, I will be talking about
identity federation This concept deals

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:13,770
with a single sign on a specific across
industries Here is an overview of what

3
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:19,199
I would like to present today coming to
the problem statement Looking at the key

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,549
challenges in digital identity management
A user, on an average, has to manage

5
00:00:25,549 --> 00:00:28,550
100 passwords across online accounts.

6
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:30,459
What are the key issues here?

7
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:32,270
Password fatigue.

8
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:38,650
66 percent of individuals reuse passwords,
increasing vulnerability to breaches.

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,890
Then comes security risk.

10
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:47,059
60 per, 61 percent of the data breaches
involve compromised credentials.

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,600
And also human error, including
phishing attacks, is a significant

12
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,885
contribution for breaches.

13
00:00:55,785 --> 00:01:00,025
Another issue is poor user
experience because 55 percent of

14
00:01:00,025 --> 00:01:05,654
consumers have abandoned online
purchase due to forgotten passwords.

15
00:01:06,175 --> 00:01:08,324
Then insufficient onboarding.

16
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:12,954
Financial institutions especially could
save up to 1 billion annually through a

17
00:01:12,954 --> 00:01:16,084
streamlined identity verification process.

18
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:22,455
So this is where identity federation
comes into picture by definition identity

19
00:01:22,455 --> 00:01:27,595
federation means a shared identity
model enabling a single identity to

20
00:01:27,595 --> 00:01:33,195
be used across multiple institutions
Such as banks or health care providers

21
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:42,435
the key benefits are seamless single
sign on accessing multiple surveys with

22
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:49,860
one login improves a lot of convenience
for the user then enhanced security

23
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:57,830
this basically Because we are using
one single, uh user sso kind of feel

24
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,870
it reduces the password fatigue and
associated risk by then It strengthens

25
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,090
the cyber security Next it improves
user experience streamlines access

26
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,580
Leading to a higher user satisfaction
and engagement So what are the key

27
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,600
concepts of this identity federation?

28
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:25,310
First one is single sign on next
standardized identity attributes

29
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:31,350
Then come consent management And then
industry specific trust framework You

30
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,320
In a single sign on experience, user
authenticates once and gain access to

31
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,000
multiple services, reducing friction.

32
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,399
In a standardized identity attributes,
basically we define essential

33
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,700
attributes for key different industries.

34
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,179
For example, for banking, uh, we
can talk about name, financial

35
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:53,869
history, financial name.

36
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:58,059
Similarly, for healthcare, we can
talk about medical history, user

37
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,790
SSN, all these kind of fields.

38
00:03:01,785 --> 00:03:03,305
Then come consent management.

39
00:03:03,755 --> 00:03:08,465
Basically this empowers users to
control over data sharing ensuring

40
00:03:08,465 --> 00:03:15,275
compliance and forecasting the trust
next industry specific trust framework

41
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:19,715
basically, this establishes rules
and standards for participation

42
00:03:19,745 --> 00:03:25,874
ensuring security and privacy And
interoperability across entities.

43
00:03:27,295 --> 00:03:32,385
Looking at the economic impact, uh,
the potential GDP growth could be

44
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:40,244
up to three to 13% by 2013 countries
implementing the Identity Federation

45
00:03:40,874 --> 00:03:43,515
cost reductions are significant.

46
00:03:44,005 --> 00:03:48,795
For example, organization reports a 50
percent reduction in these incidents that

47
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,615
are password related support incidents.

48
00:03:52,695 --> 00:03:57,095
Then onboarding time in banking,
uh, got 80 percent reduction

49
00:03:57,135 --> 00:03:59,505
saving significant resources.

50
00:04:00,645 --> 00:04:04,045
Next come healthcare savings,
interoperable systems could yield

51
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:08,894
30 billion in annual savings,
improving overall efficiency.

52
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:14,585
Um, and how do we implement,
uh, in a technical perspective?

53
00:04:15,565 --> 00:04:21,635
So first we have to, uh, set a
standard that needs to be utilized.

54
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,475
So we should extend the OAuth 2.

55
00:04:24,475 --> 00:04:27,825
0 and OpenID Connect to
create a robust framework.

56
00:04:29,175 --> 00:04:30,724
And what are the components here?

57
00:04:30,825 --> 00:04:38,060
So, uh, Extended OAuth 2 scopes allow
for specific access permissions relevant

58
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,089
to each industry, enhancing security.

59
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,830
Then, federated identity providers.

60
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:49,820
Each institution acts as both a federated
identity and a service provider.

61
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,250
Enabling seamless user experience.

62
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,840
Then comes Attribute Exchange
Protocol, which enables secure

63
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,409
sharing of user attributes, which
encryption and digital signatures.

64
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:07,360
Next, Federation Registry,
a central repository for all

65
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,429
participating institutions.

66
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,770
And, uh, should maintain a
federated registry to ensure

67
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,610
transparency and security.

68
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,750
What are the industry
specific applications?

69
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,370
For example, if we look at, uh,
banking, the onboarding efficiency

70
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,289
increases, uh, with 80 percent
reduction in onboarding time.

71
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:34,549
Saving significant banking resources
Then comes service integration this

72
00:05:34,549 --> 00:05:39,869
basically enhances customer retention
by providing seamless access to various

73
00:05:39,869 --> 00:05:47,069
services Next come fraud reduction Shared
identity verification could lead to a 90

74
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:52,840
percent decrease in identity fraud Saving
the industry approximately 7 billion

75
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,145
dollars If you look at it similarly in
a health care industry, it could save

76
00:05:58,145 --> 00:06:03,044
up to 30 billion in annual savings from
a streamlined patient record access.

77
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:07,825
It also improves care for patients
with complex histories, reducing

78
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,894
hospital readmission by 20%.

79
00:06:11,874 --> 00:06:17,430
If you look at education, Uh credential
portability a federated system

80
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:22,110
could reduce transcript verification
Time by at least 90 percent easing

81
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:27,890
student transaction transitions Uh,
and and then come enrollment growth

82
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:33,229
simplified process could increase
adult learner learner enrollment by 25

83
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:42,005
Uh, however with a lot of advantages there
are a lot of challenges to adapt this Uh,

84
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:45,055
first of all, uh, regulatory compliance.

85
00:06:45,085 --> 00:06:50,914
We must adhere to industry
specific standards as noncompliance

86
00:06:50,924 --> 00:06:52,895
can lead to severe penalties.

87
00:06:53,784 --> 00:06:57,064
Then centralized systems
may attract cyber threats.

88
00:06:57,155 --> 00:07:00,395
Robust security measures are
essential to mitigate risks.

89
00:07:01,204 --> 00:07:05,354
Protecting user data and ensuring
transparency in how data is

90
00:07:05,354 --> 00:07:07,534
shared is crucial for trust.

91
00:07:08,584 --> 00:07:13,335
Then come Uh, adoption and
interoperability collaboration

92
00:07:13,395 --> 00:07:17,765
among industry players is necessary
to create interoperable standards

93
00:07:17,995 --> 00:07:20,594
and drive widespread adoption.

94
00:07:22,265 --> 00:07:27,364
If we can look at some kind of
strategic approach here, so regulatory

95
00:07:27,395 --> 00:07:31,965
alignment, uh, basically designing
this identity federation framework

96
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:36,854
that inherently align with the key
regulation to streamline compliance.

97
00:07:37,644 --> 00:07:40,954
Then we have to use
advanced security protocols.

98
00:07:41,804 --> 00:07:44,604
It could be biometric
authentication, multi factor

99
00:07:44,604 --> 00:07:46,924
authentication to protect user data.

100
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:52,634
And we should incorporate technologies
that enhance privacy and give

101
00:07:52,684 --> 00:07:54,434
user control over their data.

102
00:07:56,045 --> 00:08:00,335
Then come we have to foster the
participations to develop and promote

103
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:02,945
interoperable standards across sectors.

104
00:08:04,205 --> 00:08:07,815
And then initiatives to inform
the organizations in that specific

105
00:08:07,815 --> 00:08:13,495
industry and users about Identity
Federation benefits and best practices.

106
00:08:14,534 --> 00:08:18,984
In conclusion, Identity Federation
represents a transformative approach

107
00:08:18,984 --> 00:08:23,055
to digital identity management that
addresses the critical challenges

108
00:08:23,465 --> 00:08:26,275
faced by users and organizations.

109
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:32,630
By enabling a seamless SSO experience
across multiple service providers,

110
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:38,200
Identity Federation enhances
user convenience and security

111
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,659
while significantly improving
the overall user experience.

112
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,100
As industries increase, digitalize,
and integrate, the ability to

113
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,210
manage identities efficiently
and securely will be paramount.

114
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,840
The economic impact of adapting identity
federation is substantial with potential

115
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:05,500
GDP growth of 3 to 13 percent by 2030 for
countries that implement these systems.

116
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,540
Additionally, sectors such as
banking, healthcare, and education

117
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:15,119
stand to save billions in operational
costs and improve service delivery.

118
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:20,819
By establishing standardized identity
attributes under a robust consent

119
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:26,035
management framework, Organizations
can foster greater trust and

120
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:28,475
interoperability among users.

121
00:09:29,454 --> 00:09:30,645
Thank you very much.
