00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,080
Hello everyone, myself, Ian.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:10,080
I'm here to present how we can use
generative AI to optimize hybrid

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,210
cloud workloads and infrastructure.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,670
The in integration of
generative AI into hybrid cloud

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,560
environments has revolutionized.

6
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:24,525
Enterprise infrastructure management,
transforming how organizations

7
00:00:24,555 --> 00:00:29,625
handle complex computing workloads
across distributor systems.

8
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:34,090
This presentation explores
how AI driven optimization.

9
00:00:34,705 --> 00:00:39,385
Creates more efficient,
secure, and resilient work.

10
00:00:39,655 --> 00:00:45,205
Hybrid architectures enabling enterprise
to move from reactive to proactive

11
00:00:45,684 --> 00:00:51,625
infrastructure management while realizing
significant cost benefits and performance.

12
00:00:52,315 --> 00:00:52,975
Improvements.

13
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:57,645
Let's understand the
complexity of hybrid cloud.

14
00:00:59,505 --> 00:01:03,425
You have the data centers, the
on-prem data centers with high

15
00:01:03,425 --> 00:01:06,635
control, but limited scalability.

16
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:09,820
The public cloud resources.

17
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:17,350
Like AWS Google Cloud Azure,
which are highly scalable with

18
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,420
consumption based pricing model.

19
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:27,820
You need a complex network topology
to connect both the on-prem data

20
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:35,350
centers and the cloud resources
with careful optimization.

21
00:01:36,245 --> 00:01:38,735
Keeping the security
and compliances in mind.

22
00:01:39,275 --> 00:01:44,735
Cross environment protection require
requires consistent policies.

23
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:48,935
Keeping the security in mind.

24
00:01:49,935 --> 00:01:56,805
The traditional management approach
falls short, manual provisioning,

25
00:01:57,645 --> 00:02:01,755
time consuming processes that
can't keep pace with the changing.

26
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:07,900
Workload demands leading to resource under
utilization or performance bottleneck,

27
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:18,270
like e-commerce website during the, during
the black Friday, there's a, the huge

28
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,760
traffic inflow during the black Friday.

29
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:29,830
So accordingly the resources has
to scale up as per the demand and

30
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,990
scale down when the demand goes down.

31
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,400
Secondly, the static resource allocation.

32
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,210
Fixed resource assignments that fail
to adopt to fluctuating workload

33
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,800
patterns, resulting of excess
capacity or performance constraints.

34
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,050
Reactive troubleshooting traditionally.

35
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,390
Addressing issues after they
impact users instead of preventing

36
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:03,430
them, increases downtime and
degrading the user experience.

37
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:09,760
The conventional approach react
the conventional approach.

38
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,170
The conventional approaches create
significant inefficiencies in

39
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:19,645
hybrid environments where workloads
must move seamlessly between the.

40
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,350
On-prem and cloud infrastructure
to maintain optimal performance

41
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,970
and cost effectiveness.

42
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,620
AI powered predictive workload.

43
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:40,260
Generative AI examines the historical
workload, workload patterns like

44
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:49,290
various metrics, logs, historical logs
to identify usage trends and predict.

45
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:57,750
Future demands machine learning models,
forecast, resources need before demand.

46
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,560
Spikes occur

47
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,395
after pre, after predicting.

48
00:04:02,174 --> 00:04:03,734
It optimizes the allocation.

49
00:04:03,795 --> 00:04:08,950
Resources automatically scale up and
down across the hybrid environments.

50
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,895
Lastly, it reduces the cost.

51
00:04:13,725 --> 00:04:19,335
Eliminating the lower provisioning we
to significant infrastructure savings.

52
00:04:19,695 --> 00:04:24,195
By implementing AI driven predictive
scaling enterprises can achieve

53
00:04:24,255 --> 00:04:31,485
up to 35% of reduction in the
infrastructure costs while ensuring

54
00:04:31,784 --> 00:04:38,325
application have the resources that
need precisely when they need them.

55
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:39,505
The AI

56
00:04:41,545 --> 00:04:47,635
in inte, the AI's intelligent Security
framework identifies anomalies and pattern

57
00:04:47,845 --> 00:04:52,315
anomaly patterns that indicate potential
threats using behavioral analysis,

58
00:04:55,075 --> 00:05:00,175
continuous verification across
hybrid environments that makes

59
00:05:00,295 --> 00:05:02,245
a zero trust architecture that

60
00:05:04,315 --> 00:05:08,425
verifies each and every
connections coming inside.

61
00:05:10,045 --> 00:05:15,685
The infrastructure, immediate threat
containment without human intervention

62
00:05:16,435 --> 00:05:18,505
with your automated responses.

63
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:25,375
The generative AI enhances security by
creating synthetic attack scenarios to.

64
00:05:25,635 --> 00:05:27,195
Test differences.

65
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:32,355
Identify vulnerabilities
before they could be.

66
00:05:32,355 --> 00:05:37,395
Explore exploited these
intelligent frameworks continuously

67
00:05:37,395 --> 00:05:39,285
learn from new threats.

68
00:05:39,795 --> 00:05:44,655
Adopting protection strategies
across both on-prem and cloud

69
00:05:45,015 --> 00:05:46,545
infrastructure in real time.

70
00:05:47,545 --> 00:05:47,965
The year

71
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:54,775
adoptive network optimization, the
real time monitoring of network

72
00:05:55,165 --> 00:06:00,295
flows and application demands by
analyzing the traffic, the network

73
00:06:00,295 --> 00:06:06,715
traffic that flows between the
on-prem and cloud infrastructure.

74
00:06:08,305 --> 00:06:13,435
Dynamic path selection based on
current condition routing optimization.

75
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:20,315
And intelligent distribution of
traffic across variable resources,

76
00:06:20,615 --> 00:06:23,165
which are situated in various regions

77
00:06:26,015 --> 00:06:26,675
or zones.

78
00:06:29,315 --> 00:06:34,115
AI driven network optimization
can reduce latency by up to 40% in

79
00:06:34,115 --> 00:06:39,305
hybrid environment by continuously
analyzing the traffic patterns and

80
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:42,245
adjusting routing configuration.

81
00:06:43,055 --> 00:06:45,065
This adaptive approach ensure.

82
00:06:45,425 --> 00:06:50,885
Optimal application performance,
even as the network conditions

83
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:52,475
change throughout the day.

84
00:06:53,475 --> 00:06:55,645
Automated decis decision making.

85
00:06:56,485 --> 00:07:02,035
The uses infrastructure as code
AI generates and optimizes the

86
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:04,945
infrastructure templates based
on the workload requirement

87
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,820
using various tools like Ansible.

88
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:18,565
Kubernetes is terraform for infrastructure
as code automatic detection and

89
00:07:18,565 --> 00:07:20,425
remedi of infrastructure issues.

90
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:28,775
Self-healing systems like the
AI looks into the logs and try

91
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:32,825
to understand if there is any
issue, if there is any errors.

92
00:07:33,305 --> 00:07:35,590
It self-heal.

93
00:07:36,065 --> 00:07:43,235
It detects those errors and remediates
immediately for faster resolution.

94
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:50,145
Continuous optimization ongoing
refinement of resources, location, and

95
00:07:50,145 --> 00:07:52,650
performance tuning if there is any.

96
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:58,975
Any long running queries
that is using huge

97
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:02,725
resources like memory.

98
00:08:03,895 --> 00:08:08,275
It does a continuous refinement
of resources allocation.

99
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,250
And does the performance tuning?

100
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,410
Yeah.

101
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:18,720
Recommends architectural improvements
based on evolving patterns that

102
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,210
gives a proactive suggestions.

103
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:29,130
By automating routine infrastructure
decisions, IT teams can reduce

104
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,795
manual intervention by up to 80%.

105
00:08:32,465 --> 00:08:37,740
