00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,020
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,820
Thanks for joining my session today.

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,290
I'll be discussing Coase architecture
for securing telemedicine data.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,760
The rapid expansion of telemedicine
has brought about a significant

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,320
shift in how healthcare is delivered,
making it more accessible and

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,120
convenient for patients worldwide.

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:24,050
However, this advancement comes with
serious cybersecurity risk as patient data

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,150
is transmitted over multiple networks.

9
00:00:26,884 --> 00:00:29,555
Often making it a target
for malicious actors.

10
00:00:30,034 --> 00:00:35,074
In today's presentation, I will discuss
how go based architecture provides

11
00:00:35,105 --> 00:00:40,114
a secure, scalable, and efficient
solution for telemedicine platforms.

12
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:45,455
Go as a programming language is built
with security first principles, offering

13
00:00:45,455 --> 00:00:49,339
features such as automatic memory
management, high performance encryption,

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,845
and secure authentication mechanisms.

15
00:00:52,474 --> 00:00:53,465
These features.

16
00:00:53,965 --> 00:00:57,475
Make it an ideal choice for
protecting patient information

17
00:00:57,475 --> 00:00:59,245
while ensuring HIPAA compliance.

18
00:00:59,745 --> 00:01:03,495
We will explore the key security
challenges in telemedicine, the

19
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:08,055
multi-layered security framework
provided by Go and also look at some

20
00:01:08,055 --> 00:01:13,095
real world success stories demonstrating
how go power solutions are reducing

21
00:01:13,095 --> 00:01:15,710
security risk in healthcare environment.

22
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:16,910
But before that.

23
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,840
Let's talk a little bit about me.

24
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,179
I'm a senior product manager at
Adobe for security and compliance.

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,080
I have 10 plus years of experience
in application and data security,

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,929
seven plus years of experience
and product management.

27
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,520
And before entering product
manager, I was a software developer.

28
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,330
I had six years of experience in
software development, in security,

29
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,890
legal and banking industry.

30
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,330
So with that, let's talk about
the telemedicine revolution.

31
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,029
Telemedicine has transformed healthcare
delivery, eliminating the geographical

32
00:01:50,029 --> 00:01:52,039
barriers between doctors and patients.

33
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:57,380
This shift has been specially prominent
in communities where access to medical

34
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,240
professional was previously limited.

35
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:05,210
The adoption of TE telemedicine
skyrocketed 38 times after COVID-19

36
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:10,185
pandemic proving its long-term viability
as a mainstream healthcare solution.

37
00:02:10,654 --> 00:02:14,545
However, with increased
usage comes increased risk.

38
00:02:15,255 --> 00:02:18,865
Hackers and cyber minerals
are now targeting telehealth

39
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,665
platforms attempting to gain.

40
00:02:21,544 --> 00:02:25,925
Unauthorized access to sensitive
patient data, medical records,

41
00:02:26,135 --> 00:02:27,575
and financial information.

42
00:02:28,474 --> 00:02:33,935
Healthcare providers must balance
accessibility with security, ensuring

43
00:02:33,935 --> 00:02:38,825
that virtual con consultations
remain private, secure, and

44
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,789
fully compliant with healthcare
regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR.

45
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:48,119
GOs architecture is particularly
suited for secure tele telemedicine

46
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:52,739
applications as it allows for
efficient handling of concurrent

47
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:57,299
application, seamless authentication
and strong encryption protocol.

48
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:00,859
Now let's talk about the security
challenges in telemedicine.

49
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:05,049
The rapid adoption of telemedicine
has introduced several.

50
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:12,499
Several, security challenges that must be,
addressed to ensure the privacy, integrity

51
00:03:12,529 --> 00:03:14,809
and confidentiality of patient data.

52
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:20,119
One of the biggest risk is data
transmission security as patient

53
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:25,669
information is traveling across multiple
networks, some of which may be unsecured

54
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:27,439
or vulnerable to cyber attacks.

55
00:03:28,369 --> 00:03:31,339
Another major concern is authentication.

56
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:36,979
While providers must implement strong
identity verification to prevent

57
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:41,659
unauthorized access, they must
also ensure that the login process

58
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:44,249
remains, seamless and user-friendly.

59
00:03:44,749 --> 00:03:48,889
Regulatory compliance is another
significant challenge with loss,

60
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:53,694
such as HIPAA and GDPR requiring
strict data protection measures.

61
00:03:53,694 --> 00:03:57,679
Failure to comply with these
regulations can lead to hefty

62
00:03:57,679 --> 00:04:00,019
files and reputational damage.

63
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:05,209
Additionally third party integration
with cloud services, payment gateways,

64
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:10,249
and electronic health records introduced
multiple attack vectors, increasing

65
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:12,169
the likelihood of data breaches.

66
00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:19,639
In 2023, the healthcare sector witnessed
6 47 data breaches affecting more than

67
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:25,614
78 million individuals highlighting the
urgent need of robust security frameworks.

68
00:04:26,114 --> 00:04:30,814
Why go for Healthcare Security Go
is an excellent choice for securing

69
00:04:30,814 --> 00:04:34,804
telemedicine platform due to its
security oriented architecture

70
00:04:34,864 --> 00:04:36,754
and high performance capabilities.

71
00:04:37,504 --> 00:04:43,174
One of its standout feature is memory
safety, which prevents common ties

72
00:04:43,204 --> 00:04:48,304
like buffer overflow and memory leak,
reducing the risk of cyber attacks

73
00:04:48,304 --> 00:04:50,794
that exploit memory management flaws.

74
00:04:51,294 --> 00:04:55,374
Another critical aspect is close
lightweight concurrency model,

75
00:04:55,494 --> 00:04:59,664
which allows healthcare application
to handle thousands of simul

76
00:04:59,844 --> 00:05:05,034
list patient connections without
compromising security or performance.

77
00:05:05,784 --> 00:05:11,004
Furthermore, CO comes with a rich standard
library that includes cryptographic

78
00:05:11,274 --> 00:05:17,784
tools, enabling developers to implement
strong encryption mechanism without

79
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,704
relying on third party dependencies.

80
00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:25,209
This reduces the chance of introducing
Vulner through external libraries.

81
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:30,909
These features may go a powerful and
reliable choice for developing secure

82
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:35,829
telemedicine application that can
withstand modern cybersecurity threats.

83
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:39,059
Let's talk about a multi-layered
security framework.

84
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:44,669
A multi-layered security free approach
is essential for fortifying telemedicine

85
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:46,409
platform against cyber threats.

86
00:05:46,844 --> 00:05:52,334
The first layer, the application security
ensures that all input is validated.

87
00:05:52,844 --> 00:05:57,974
Output is contextually encoded,
and the system adheres to the O OSP

88
00:05:58,334 --> 00:06:02,894
compliance safeguards to prevent
common web vulnerabilities such as SQL

89
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:04,784
injection and cross site scripting.

90
00:06:05,654 --> 00:06:12,194
The second layer is data protection, which
leverages a ES 2 56 encryption for data at

91
00:06:12,194 --> 00:06:15,884
rest and DLS 1.3 for secure transmission.

92
00:06:16,304 --> 00:06:19,274
Ensuring that patient
records remain confidential.

93
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:27,044
The third layer access controls involve
granular, role-based permission, and

94
00:06:27,044 --> 00:06:31,634
multifactor authentication, reducing
the risk of unauthorized access.

95
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:38,294
The fourth layer network security
incorporates TLS mutual authentication,

96
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:42,824
zero trust segmentation, and
next gen firewalls to protect

97
00:06:43,094 --> 00:06:44,564
against external threats.

98
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:50,609
Finally, infrastructure security
focus on focuses on hardened cloud

99
00:06:50,609 --> 00:06:56,159
configurations, immutable infrastructure,
and continuous security monitoring.

100
00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:00,719
Studies show that organizations
that implement a defense in depth

101
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:06,779
strategy, experience 87% reduction in
security incident while maintaining

102
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,029
a high system performance.

103
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,079
Let's talk about
authentication mechanisms.

104
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:16,239
Authentication is a corner store
of cybersecurity in telemedicine,

105
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:21,909
ensuring only authorized users such
as doctors, nurses, and patients can

106
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,854
access sensitive healthcare data.

107
00:07:24,354 --> 00:07:27,624
Architecture provides four
primary authentication

108
00:07:27,624 --> 00:07:29,514
mechanism to enhance security.

109
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:30,774
First.

110
00:07:31,674 --> 00:07:36,354
Multifactor authentication integrates
seamlessly with go's context pack,

111
00:07:36,405 --> 00:07:40,304
context package, allowing secure
one-time password and biometric

112
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:42,465
verification with minimal latency.

113
00:07:42,965 --> 00:07:46,695
Second, JWT, which is Chase and web token.

114
00:07:47,444 --> 00:07:52,694
Implementation is powered by go's
native cryptographic libraries, ensuring

115
00:07:53,384 --> 00:07:56,634
authentication, tokens for user sessions.

116
00:07:56,874 --> 00:07:58,704
Third is session management.

117
00:07:58,974 --> 00:08:04,254
In GO is lightweight and scalable
efficiently tracking thousands

118
00:08:04,254 --> 00:08:08,969
of concurrent user sessions while
enforcing strict expiration controls.

119
00:08:09,549 --> 00:08:15,069
Lastly, single Sign-on Federation allows
COB platform to seamlessly integrate

120
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:21,099
with identity providers such as or
Open id, and SAML Enhancing Usability.

121
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:25,929
While maintaining robust security
research has shown that organization

122
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:31,749
using COASE authentication achieve
a 99.9% success rate in preventing

123
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:33,369
unauthorized access attempts.

124
00:08:33,869 --> 00:08:34,949
Now let's talk up.

125
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:37,289
Talk about encryption implementation.

126
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:42,449
Encryption plays a crucial role
in safeguarding telemedicine

127
00:08:42,449 --> 00:08:46,109
communication and data storage goes.

128
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:50,099
Building security tools enable
encryption at multiple levels.

129
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,780
Transport layer, security shows
end-to-end encryption for all data

130
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:59,520
transmitted over networks significantly
reducing the risk of man attack.

131
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:06,530
For data address goal leverages AEs 2 56
encryption, which is virtually unbreakable

132
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,569
under the current computing capabilities.

133
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:14,930
Additionally, goal-based application
implement end-to-end encryption for video

134
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:19,430
consultation and messaging, ensuring
that no third parties can intercept

135
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,100
and decrypt confidential conversations.

136
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,329
Finally, coup supports
hardware security module.

137
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:30,199
For security key for secure
key management, allowing

138
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:34,189
organizations to rotate and
recover encryption keys seamlessly.

139
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:39,589
Proper encryption practices have been
shown to reduce data interception

140
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:44,029
risk by 94%, making them essential
for telemedicine security.

141
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:47,554
Now let's talk about microservices
architecture benefits.

142
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:53,154
Microservices architectures have
revolutionized the way telemedicine

143
00:09:53,154 --> 00:09:56,934
platforms handle security,
scalability, and system resilience.

144
00:09:57,654 --> 00:10:02,334
Unlike monolithic application,
microservices break down functionalities

145
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:07,134
into smaller independent services,
making them easier to manage and secure.

146
00:10:07,134 --> 00:10:07,314
Secure.

147
00:10:08,184 --> 00:10:12,324
One of the biggest advantage of this
architecture is isolation, where

148
00:10:12,384 --> 00:10:17,514
each service operates independently
within its security parameters.

149
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:22,239
This means that even if one service
is compromised, the entire system

150
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:26,049
remains protected, reducing the
impact of security breaches.

151
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:32,019
Additionally, scalability is greatly
enhanced because security critical

152
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:38,139
components can be individually scaled to
handle increased workloads or adjusted

153
00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:40,089
based on evolving threat profiles.

154
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:42,959
Another gEEP benefit
is seamless deployment.

155
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:49,289
Because microservices allow targeted
updates, organizations can deploy security

156
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:51,689
patch patches without causing downtime.

157
00:10:52,424 --> 00:10:56,774
This ensures that security
vulnerabilities are addressed promptly

158
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:59,084
without disrupting patient care.

159
00:10:59,714 --> 00:11:04,364
Finally, monitoring and threat
detections are more precise as security

160
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:09,344
telemetry is collected at granular
level, allowing for faster detection

161
00:11:09,404 --> 00:11:11,324
and mitigation of security threats.

162
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:16,499
Studies show that organizations
which are transitioning to go powered

163
00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:22,379
microservices architecture experience
a 94 red percent reduction in security

164
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:27,959
incidents while significantly improving
systems uptime and reliability.

165
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:31,084
Let's talk about some real
world success stories.

166
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:35,644
The effectiveness of gob base
architecture in telemedicine

167
00:11:35,644 --> 00:11:37,684
security is not just theoretical.

168
00:11:38,224 --> 00:11:41,644
It has been proven by real
world implementation across

169
00:11:41,644 --> 00:11:43,504
various healthcare organization.

170
00:11:44,224 --> 00:11:48,754
One notable example is major
hospital network that within six

171
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:54,214
months of migrating to based go
powered microservices, reduced

172
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:59,464
its security incident by 94%
while cutting down response time.

173
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:02,089
Two potential threats by 78%.

174
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:07,219
This was achieved through a
combination of en enhanced encryption,

175
00:12:07,489 --> 00:12:11,149
multifactor authentication, and
zero trust network segmentation.

176
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:17,529
Similarly, a virtual care startup
faced challenges in scaling securely

177
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,159
while ensuring HIPAA compliance.

178
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:25,669
By adopting go based security solutions,
they achieved full compliance in just

179
00:12:25,669 --> 00:12:30,769
90 days while successfully handling
over 50,000 daily patient consultation.

180
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:35,289
This demonstrates the secure
architectures do not have to compromise.

181
00:12:35,634 --> 00:12:37,254
Performance or scalability.

182
00:12:37,554 --> 00:12:42,354
Lastly, a health insurance provider that
processes 12 million sensitive customer

183
00:12:42,354 --> 00:12:46,914
records daily, implemented a goal-based
API gateway, maintaining zero data

184
00:12:46,914 --> 00:12:48,714
breaches for three consecutive years.

185
00:12:49,344 --> 00:12:53,634
This case highlights go ability to
provide secure high performance solution

186
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,154
even in data intensive environment.

187
00:12:56,654 --> 00:12:58,844
Let's talk about an
implementation roadmap.

188
00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:03,659
Implementing a goal-based security
framework requires a structured

189
00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:08,099
step-by-step approach to ensure
comprehensive protection without

190
00:13:08,099 --> 00:13:10,229
operational disrupt disruptions.

191
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:15,689
The process began with security
assessment where a detailed audit is

192
00:13:15,689 --> 00:13:19,529
conducted to identify vulnerabilities
with existing infrastructure.

193
00:13:20,219 --> 00:13:23,609
This is crucial because
unidentified security gaps can

194
00:13:23,609 --> 00:13:25,229
lead to potential data breaches.

195
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:27,599
The next step is architecture design.

196
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:31,874
Where security components such as
encryption layer, authentication

197
00:13:31,874 --> 00:13:38,384
mechanism, and secure APIs are crucial,
are carefully integrated into the system.

198
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:42,374
Once the architecture is designed,
prototype development follows

199
00:13:42,554 --> 00:13:45,854
creating a proof of concept
microservices implementation

200
00:13:45,854 --> 00:13:47,684
to test core security features.

201
00:13:48,284 --> 00:13:51,374
The fourth step is testing and hardening.

202
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:55,889
Which involves conducting rigorous
pen tests to stimulate real

203
00:13:55,889 --> 00:13:59,909
world cyber attacks, allowing
organization to fine tune security

204
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:01,919
measures based on testing results.

205
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:07,259
Finally, the deployment and monitoring
phase ensures a progressive rollout of

206
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:12,389
security features supported by automated
scanning and real-time threat detection

207
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:15,259
organizations that follow this strategic.

208
00:14:15,694 --> 00:14:19,804
Roadmap typically achieves full
HIPAA compliance within four to six

209
00:14:19,804 --> 00:14:23,884
months, all while minimizing downtime
and ensuring seamless patient care.

210
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:28,884
