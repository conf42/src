1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,160
Good morning.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:02,990
Good afternoon, everyone.

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:08,170
I'm Ash Lakshmi, currently
working in DT data.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:13,210
US with over 22 years of
experience in quality engineering,

5
00:00:13,899 --> 00:00:20,110
especially specialized in testing,
architecture, health plan systems,

6
00:00:20,404 --> 00:00:22,465
and enterprise integration.

7
00:00:23,075 --> 00:00:29,334
Throughout my career I have played
a. Pivotal role in ensuring seamless

8
00:00:29,334 --> 00:00:34,585
implementation of enterprise application,
accelerating healthcare system

9
00:00:34,585 --> 00:00:41,485
transformations, and enhancing compliance
through advanced test automation strategy.

10
00:00:41,985 --> 00:00:47,580
I'm here to be to talk
about how observability can

11
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,239
transform quality assurance in.

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:58,609
Health insurance platforms with over two
decades in IT and quality engineering.

13
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:06,350
I have firsthand how traditional QA
falls short in today's fast moving,

14
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,740
highly regulated healthcare environments.

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:17,265
That's why this talks about
evolving from testing to.

16
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:25,000
Observing and how that
shift unlocks mass U value.

17
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:31,450
It can be for providers, it is for
members and any payers actually

18
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,070
in a health insurance platform.

19
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:39,959
The industry is in such a way that
where trust, complaints and experience

20
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:43,529
are not negotiated, but we need.

21
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:50,969
Monitoring strategies that are
not just reactive, but proactive,

22
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,359
insightful, and actionable.

23
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:55,039
Okay.

24
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,650
Now why observability matters.

25
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,200
Let's start with why.

26
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:08,730
The healthcare sector today
loses an average of 43% in

27
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,550
revenue during system outages.

28
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:17,650
The difference between having and
not having observatory tools, the

29
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:25,120
mean time to resolve is 68 minutes
without observability, but with

30
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,990
observability it is just 12 minutes.

31
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:34,460
And then there is uptime
expectation, availability of the

32
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,480
systems, which is 99.99 percentage.

33
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:46,900
This is not just a target, it is
a necessity for member experience,

34
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,780
trust, and the regulatory compliance.

35
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,110
In other words,
observability is not luxury.

36
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,625
It's a. Survival tool.

37
00:02:57,125 --> 00:03:02,125
Okay, let's think of an example
In a health insurance, a parent is

38
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:06,375
trying to update their insurance
coverage for their child's surgery.

39
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:11,675
They log into the member portal and
portal crashes and doesn't provide

40
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:13,145
that information what they need.

41
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:14,645
It was dumb.

42
00:03:15,515 --> 00:03:16,865
It's a failed promise.

43
00:03:17,105 --> 00:03:18,845
What is an experience of a member?

44
00:03:19,745 --> 00:03:28,565
Emotionally the person is trying to
go going through the surgery, whereas

45
00:03:29,405 --> 00:03:34,045
from an IT support standpoint, as
a payer, we are not able to provide

46
00:03:34,045 --> 00:03:35,485
that service what they needed.

47
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:35,640
It.

48
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,800
It's a failed promise.

49
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:43,130
So that is our observability, is how we
prevent these moments and make it more

50
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:47,870
user experience, member experience,
provide a smooth transition journey.

51
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,970
That is all it's about here actually.

52
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,620
Okay.

53
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,880
Now what is the observability Trinity?

54
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,140
Okay.

55
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,899
It is not just about logging.

56
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:00,500
Metrics logs and traces actually.

57
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:00,860
Okay.

58
00:04:01,619 --> 00:04:05,700
How this is categorized into,
let's take about the metrics.

59
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:08,819
What are the quantifiable insights?

60
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:11,339
Think about dashboards.

61
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:18,349
Think about claim processing tank by
complexity, prior authorization, approval

62
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:25,104
rates, member portal latency during open
enrollment, or a peak enrollment period.

63
00:04:25,544 --> 00:04:25,624
Actually.

64
00:04:26,124 --> 00:04:27,294
And then logs.

65
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:34,404
It tells the story behind system events,
which is vital for audits, compliance,

66
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:38,864
and debugging a member access their data.

67
00:04:39,174 --> 00:04:43,914
Where the log shows what PHA
data, PA data has been accessed.

68
00:04:44,455 --> 00:04:47,995
It also narrates a detailed
error locks when a provider

69
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:50,005
lookup fails what it failed.

70
00:04:50,505 --> 00:04:51,735
HIPAA compliance.

71
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:52,335
Okay.

72
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:57,854
Anything on audit trail, which will
show it and log offers context as

73
00:04:57,854 --> 00:05:03,125
well as a compliance coverage, and
then traces, it connects the dot,

74
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,805
showing that end to end journey.

75
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,425
What does it mean?

76
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:10,655
It is, it claims will go
through multiple systems.

77
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,730
And my in a PA architecture where
20 plus microservices, which will go

78
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:21,960
through it, checking that eligibility,
checking that provider provider validity.

79
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,650
And then what bene what is
the pricing configuration?

80
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,540
What benefits has been applied?

81
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,590
Do it does they need any oath?

82
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,350
What is the status of the claim?

83
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,325
It's a end-to-end journey, which is, goes
through with, through various services.

84
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:42,880
And then all the, each
step it monitors and trace

85
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,010
to track the

86
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,310
processing details of it.

87
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:47,479
Okay?

88
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,950
So in fact, traces are vital
and distributed a architecture,

89
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:56,040
especially with APAs third party
systems and legacy bridges.

90
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:57,090
Okay?

91
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,765
Together they empower.

92
00:05:59,595 --> 00:06:04,665
Teams to monitor, diagnose,
and optimize complex workflow.

93
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:08,915
Now coming about regulatory benefits.

94
00:06:09,415 --> 00:06:09,805
Okay?

95
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,719
Observability is not a
compliance enabler anymore.

96
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:19,654
It is a regulatory, which is a mandatory
requirement actually, especially

97
00:06:19,984 --> 00:06:21,934
think about HIPAA audit readiness.

98
00:06:22,434 --> 00:06:28,664
Tracking who access PHA and when, or
being able to trace every step of a

99
00:06:28,664 --> 00:06:33,704
claims journey or even automatically
preserving access evidence

100
00:06:33,764 --> 00:06:36,434
during regulatory investigations.

101
00:06:37,004 --> 00:06:41,149
It's not about fixing things
fast, but also providing you

102
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:42,309
are doing the right things.

103
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:46,964
Q eight teams often overlook this.

104
00:06:47,804 --> 00:06:49,214
Observability isn't just.

105
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:50,789
Technical.

106
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:52,659
It's a legal armor.

107
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:53,519
Okay.

108
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:58,254
Where then coming on to
other, what are the metrics?

109
00:06:58,324 --> 00:06:59,879
Which they measure it, right?

110
00:07:00,549 --> 00:07:05,594
Hipaa audit readiness, claims,
processing verifications, SLA,

111
00:07:05,914 --> 00:07:08,705
documentations, evidence, preservations.

112
00:07:08,784 --> 00:07:12,599
All those are, being part of
that comp compliance benefit,

113
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,500
which is being monitored

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,240
now.

115
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,419
Now, let's think about some of
the metrics in the real claims

116
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:20,570
processing auto adjudication rate.

117
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,300
Obviously, system need to handle the
amount of claims, what we received, and

118
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,130
what is our ajudication success rate.

119
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,580
First time, first pass, resolution
percentage, average processing duration.

120
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,385
Here are rates by claim type.

121
00:07:36,885 --> 00:07:40,539
It's all about the claims data
processing data, which needs to be

122
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:42,069
measured from a metrics standpoint.

123
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,859
Member experience, portal availability.

124
00:07:44,859 --> 00:07:50,169
I was sharing an example of member
portal available for a surgery.

125
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:54,009
It is important
authentication success rate.

126
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:57,664
If you're searching for a
provider, what accuracy is the

127
00:07:57,664 --> 00:07:59,514
right provider being shown?

128
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:00,649
And right.

129
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:02,209
Services being offered.

130
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:04,879
And then session duration metrics.

131
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:05,479
Okay.

132
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:09,649
Average session, how long it takes
to that member is there in the

133
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:11,269
portal, which they can use it.

134
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:16,219
And then system performance last,
which is a database query, a PA

135
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:21,019
response time infrastructure, resource
utilization, and batch processing.

136
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:22,219
Completion rates.

137
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:23,179
Okay?

138
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:28,189
This is where domain specific
observability makes a difference.

139
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:31,294
You can't improve what you can't measure.

140
00:08:32,164 --> 00:08:37,834
And these kps directly linked to cost,
compliance and customer satisfaction.

141
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:42,144
Now the question comes up,
how do you implement it?

142
00:08:42,644 --> 00:08:44,714
Here is how to make it happen.

143
00:08:45,704 --> 00:08:52,514
Assess your gaps and critical
systems instrument them setting

144
00:08:52,514 --> 00:08:54,599
up metrics, logs and tracers.

145
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:57,919
Centralize everything
into a single platform.

146
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:04,549
Use unified observability platforms
to correlate events, visualize

147
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:10,479
it, create dashboards tailored
by roles, compliance operations.

148
00:09:11,229 --> 00:09:17,654
It is and automate AI driven
anomaly detection and predictive

149
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:22,599
alerts to RCA root cause
analysis, automated remediation.

150
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:25,404
We can do it from an
automation standpoint.

151
00:09:25,904 --> 00:09:30,434
This roadmap shifts QA from
a reactive call center to a

152
00:09:30,884 --> 00:09:33,194
proactive reliability enabler.

153
00:09:33,694 --> 00:09:39,394
Okay, now let's talk about how
observability heading actually.

154
00:09:40,114 --> 00:09:40,144
Okay.

155
00:09:40,644 --> 00:09:46,369
The industry wide, there are tools
such as Datadog, Dynatrace, Splunk.

156
00:09:47,094 --> 00:09:52,314
Multiple tools available in the
market, which provides all specialized

157
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:57,954
categor specialized capabilities for
monitoring regulated healthcare systems.

158
00:09:58,454 --> 00:10:02,209
Okay, now, from a yay standpoint, okay.

159
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:04,599
How this observability is heading.

160
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:07,359
It is one is anomaly detection.

161
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:12,669
That means identify the fraud or
the slowdowns in claim workflows.

162
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:18,734
Before users notice, predictive
alert your forecasting system,

163
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:24,494
stress before it crashes, member
access, provider access, or anything.

164
00:10:24,884 --> 00:10:30,854
Then root cause analysis cut down
days of debugging into minutes,

165
00:10:31,514 --> 00:10:36,944
self-healing, automatically restart
services or rewrote request so that

166
00:10:37,364 --> 00:10:41,805
member or a provider, or any processing
provides a smooth experience.

167
00:10:42,305 --> 00:10:48,935
A doesn't replace teams, it empowers them
to move from firefighting to foresight.

168
00:10:49,435 --> 00:10:49,704
Okay.

169
00:10:50,574 --> 00:10:54,439
Let me take a case study of
Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield.

170
00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:57,579
The challenge, what they
face it is they were.

171
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:04,319
Frequently facing portal outages which
passes a delays averaging 12 day claim.

172
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:09,949
Processing delays 12 days and
outages affecting 15 million users.

173
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:16,269
They implemented distributed tracing
across 200 plus services and built real

174
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:19,029
time dashboards with claims pipelines.

175
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:21,579
What is the result mean?

176
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:24,819
Time to resolution dropped
from 45 to five minutes.

177
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:29,079
And claim processing time
down by 62 percentage.

178
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:37,379
So it's a lessons start with high
impact business areas and see how

179
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:42,269
trust cross-functional teams improve
their observability or options.

180
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,339
Okay, now challenges, right?

181
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:48,429
It's this is the main, we
know what is a problem.

182
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:49,869
We know what is a solution.

183
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:52,675
What challenges we have to address it.

184
00:11:52,854 --> 00:11:55,014
One is security concerns.

185
00:11:55,584 --> 00:12:00,354
Balancing observability with
P-H-A-P-H-A must be protected

186
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:01,734
even while at observing it.

187
00:12:02,604 --> 00:12:10,134
Fast management storing logs and
traces add up and you need policies

188
00:12:10,914 --> 00:12:14,874
till how long you should keep it
to monitor and do that analysis.

189
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:20,984
Then legacy system I. You need to
have a minimal disruptions, and

190
00:12:20,984 --> 00:12:25,054
many of those legacy systems may not
be built for observability teams.

191
00:12:25,554 --> 00:12:27,774
Do they have skills you may need?

192
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:32,724
We need to provide training, qa,
ops teams, all those criticalities

193
00:12:32,724 --> 00:12:33,894
to be built out actually.

194
00:12:34,764 --> 00:12:37,854
So PACE yourself built incrementally.

195
00:12:38,454 --> 00:12:41,694
Use pilot services to prove value.

196
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:47,014
Okay, so what did, what is the next
step from an point of view standpoint?

197
00:12:47,014 --> 00:12:49,344
Right here is what I recommend,

198
00:12:49,844 --> 00:12:53,439
assess, start with one critical
services, like a claims or

199
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,389
eligibility or a member quota.

200
00:12:55,889 --> 00:13:01,049
Do a pilot of it, instrument
it, track metrics, add logs, map

201
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:07,369
traces, and then try to scale
based on pilot's, learning rollout,

202
00:13:07,869 --> 00:13:09,249
observability across the platform.

203
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:14,379
And then try to optimize with create
dashboards, apply a align with

204
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:17,229
compliance, or you can adjust based on it.

205
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:20,409
And don't forget QA ops.

206
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:27,584
Security and product must partner
in this journey, let observability

207
00:13:27,854 --> 00:13:30,164
become our invisible advantage.

208
00:13:30,664 --> 00:13:37,024
So to conclude it, observability isn't
just a tool set, it's a mindset shift.

209
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:38,854
It redefines qa.

210
00:13:39,354 --> 00:13:44,874
It's how we shift from defect
detection to experience protection.

211
00:13:45,654 --> 00:13:51,504
From compliance, stress to audit,
confidence from reactive to predicting.

212
00:13:52,004 --> 00:13:52,244
Okay.

213
00:13:52,574 --> 00:13:56,144
