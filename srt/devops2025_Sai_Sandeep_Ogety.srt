1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,609
Generative AI is like a groundbreaking
technology, capable of like creating

2
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:07,970
new content, solving problems,
and also automating the processes.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,989
So today, like, we'll focus on its
application in cloud native DevOps, a

4
00:00:12,989 --> 00:00:17,620
methodology combining the scalability
of cloud native principles with the

5
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:19,459
agility of like DevOps practices.

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,669
So to set the expectations
throughout this talk, I'll

7
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,480
highlight like real world use cases.

8
00:00:25,075 --> 00:00:29,354
Key benefits and challenges along with
like practical advice for integrating

9
00:00:29,365 --> 00:00:31,595
AI into your DevOps pipeline.

10
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:36,305
And also, but first like, let's
define like what a Gen AI really is.

11
00:00:36,805 --> 00:00:38,894
So what is like Gen AI?

12
00:00:38,964 --> 00:00:44,935
Like Gen AI refers to models like GPT
and DAL E that can create new outputs,

13
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:49,795
such as text, images, and even code by
learning the patterns from existing data.

14
00:00:49,795 --> 00:00:49,835
Okay.

15
00:00:50,345 --> 00:00:52,365
So to give like real
life, examples, right?

16
00:00:52,365 --> 00:00:57,564
So chat GPT assets with the NLP tasks,
like natural language for tasks and with

17
00:00:57,564 --> 00:01:02,245
also with the GitHub, Copilot generates
code and Dali creates like images.

18
00:01:02,585 --> 00:01:05,015
So these tools are not just, tools.

19
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,485
They are like enablers of great
productivity and creativity

20
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,215
in the tech workflows.

21
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,380
So to highlight like relevance to
the topic on the DevOps, right,

22
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:17,560
like in depth, like in DevOps,
generally, so Genii can streamline

23
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,460
workflows, improving the collaboration
and reducing the manual effort.

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,050
which leads us to why it's gaining
traction in modern development.

25
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,900
And when it comes to the transition
before, like we deep dive into the

26
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,700
applications, let's explore the challenges
in the modern, software development that

27
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,290
generates like AI that helps to address.

28
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,480
So let me go to the next slide and
let's talk about the challenges.

29
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,000
So like what, what are the
challenges in like DevOps, you

30
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,610
know, software development, right?

31
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,650
So let's go deep dive into this.

32
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,060
So.

33
00:01:50,475 --> 00:01:54,465
So firstly, like let's say rapidly
evolving technologies make it difficult

34
00:01:54,845 --> 00:01:57,365
for developers to stay up to date, right?

35
00:01:57,395 --> 00:02:02,645
So Genii can help bridge that gap
by offering context, you know,

36
00:02:02,715 --> 00:02:04,955
assistance and also recommendations.

37
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:09,565
And, also like secondly, let's talk
about like increasing complexity

38
00:02:09,615 --> 00:02:14,785
of applications requires more
sophisticated tools to manage code

39
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:16,535
and infrastructure effectively.

40
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:23,210
AI provides automation and error reduction
and, on the next, let's talk about like

41
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,570
shorter development cycles, place pressure
on the teams to deliver faster pace.

42
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:35,900
So, so AI can accelerate testing
and deployment giving teams

43
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,610
like the breaking room, right?

44
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,160
So, and like finally security
and compliance concerns

45
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,420
are growing as we all know.

46
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,640
Gen AI can proactively identify
the vulnerabilities and ensure

47
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,170
adherence to evolving regulations.

48
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:52,529
So how do we integrate like,
Gen AI into DevOps effectively?

49
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,180
So let's, let's define a foundation
of like how, native DevOps.

50
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,420
So if I go to next slide.

51
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,070
Okay.

52
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,720
So let's go to the, like defining
cloud native DevOps, right?

53
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,200
So.

54
00:03:05,705 --> 00:03:09,545
Cloud native DevOps emphasizes
applications designed for the cloud,

55
00:03:09,825 --> 00:03:13,225
scalable, resilient, and leveraging
the microservices architecture.

56
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:18,455
So if we talk about the DevOps practices,
DevOps integrates It's planning, coding,

57
00:03:18,645 --> 00:03:23,335
deploying, testing, and also monitoring
into the unified automated pipeline,

58
00:03:23,585 --> 00:03:25,635
fostering, the collaboration across teams.

59
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:28,795
So to highlight, like, the synergy, right?

60
00:03:28,815 --> 00:03:34,315
So combining these principles
with AI creates like an ecosystem.

61
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,160
where applications are not
only effective but also like

62
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,720
adaptive to evolving demands.

63
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:45,760
So now let's see like how AI bridges
the gap into the ecosystem, right?

64
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:51,460
So, okay, So let's go and talk about
like see how AI can bridge the gap

65
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,400
like integrating with DevOps, so
let's break down the benefits, right?

66
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,160
The first, firstly, AI automate the
repetitive tasks, as you all know,

67
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,180
like freeing up the developers to focus
on strategic and high value content.

68
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,070
Like, let's say if developers are, you
know, writing code for the business

69
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,490
development, they can actually focus.

70
00:04:10,925 --> 00:04:14,255
on, the business logic instead of,
like, you know, trying to figure

71
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:17,985
anything out, like DevOps stuff,
like, deploying, you know, the CI CD

72
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:20,409
pipelines and configuring and et cetera.

73
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:25,345
And also it improves the, you know,
efficiency and also by reducing errors

74
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,745
and accepting, accelerating the workflows.

75
00:04:28,085 --> 00:04:30,735
And accepting like the
income of, of that, right?

76
00:04:30,735 --> 00:04:35,495
So, and also AI provides insights
from data, enhancing the application,

77
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,625
performance, and also the security.

78
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:43,154
So most importantly, it helps
organizations adapt to changing technology

79
00:04:43,154 --> 00:04:46,035
landscapes seamlessly without no issues.

80
00:04:46,384 --> 00:04:51,595
And also to talk about the real world
impact, many organizations already report,

81
00:04:51,665 --> 00:04:57,065
you know, shorter development cycles and
better scalability with AI driven DevOps.

82
00:04:57,194 --> 00:04:57,244
DevOps.

83
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:03,840
And let's dig deeper into like specific
AI capabilities into DevOps cycle and,

84
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,090
starting with like code generation.

85
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,479
So let's talk about like how, AI
can, you know, generate or help

86
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:13,189
the automating the code generation.

87
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:17,049
So AI powered tools, like
we all know, Copilot, right?

88
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,409
So GitHub Copilot assist.

89
00:05:18,914 --> 00:05:24,294
with code complexion saving developers
hours of manual work and AI can

90
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:29,564
generate entire code blocks or
functions from simple prompts to

91
00:05:29,784 --> 00:05:35,654
reducing repetitive tasks over and
over and code factoring tools like,

92
00:05:35,694 --> 00:05:40,584
analyze existing code to suggest the
improvements, ensuring the better

93
00:05:40,644 --> 00:05:42,744
readability and also the performance.

94
00:05:43,204 --> 00:05:48,484
So to talk about, like, the impact,
these features help, like, reduce

95
00:05:48,544 --> 00:05:53,384
the technical depth and also
accelerate the delivery timelines.

96
00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:56,054
And also, let's talk about the transition.

97
00:05:56,064 --> 00:06:01,524
So beyond coding, AI can optimize
this continuous integration and also

98
00:06:01,524 --> 00:06:03,134
the continuous, delivery pipelines.

99
00:06:03,534 --> 00:06:07,374
So let's talk about, like,
how, AI can actually help in

100
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:10,374
like enhancing CICD, pipelines.

101
00:06:11,074 --> 00:06:14,254
So the key improvements
in this area, right?

102
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:20,074
So automated testing generates by
AI ensures broader test coverage

103
00:06:20,134 --> 00:06:22,114
and also the faster bug detection.

104
00:06:22,524 --> 00:06:26,824
This is one of the key improvements
that AI can help within the CICD world.

105
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:31,384
And also like AI powered deployments
tools like Analyze, right?

106
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:36,734
Performance data to recommend optimal
like strategies for scaling and deployment

107
00:06:37,604 --> 00:06:42,774
and predictive maintenance is also like
one of another area that we can improve

108
00:06:42,774 --> 00:06:47,444
with AI, like predictive maintenance,
monitor systems to identify and address

109
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:54,574
issues before it actually happens and to
also like, let's, let's also in explore

110
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:58,254
how AI role in like enhancing security.

111
00:06:58,654 --> 00:07:03,924
Because as we all know, like
security is the key and also, for

112
00:07:03,944 --> 00:07:06,914
any development like nowadays, right?

113
00:07:06,914 --> 00:07:12,294
So let's talk about how we can improve
security and vulnerability detection.

114
00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:17,894
So let's say, let's discuss about the,
security enhancements, for example.

115
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:22,374
So AI detects unusual patterns
in network trafficking, right?

116
00:07:22,804 --> 00:07:26,604
And, enables faster responses
to potential threats.

117
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:31,749
So vulnerability assessment tools
scan code and suggest patches,

118
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,919
reducing the risk of breaches.

119
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:39,269
And other example is like security
policy, you know, and enforcement

120
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:43,629
ensures compliance by automating and
mitigating the risky configurations.

121
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:49,184
So now let's take a look up
like how AI can optimizes

122
00:07:49,194 --> 00:07:51,524
resource allocation and scaling.

123
00:07:52,144 --> 00:07:54,994
So to talk about that, let me go.

124
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:55,274
Yeah.

125
00:07:55,624 --> 00:07:59,074
To talk about like how AI
can really help in optimizing

126
00:07:59,574 --> 00:08:01,484
resource allocation and scaling.

127
00:08:01,484 --> 00:08:06,734
So one of the key areas here is the AI
can predict resources based upon the

128
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:11,094
historical data of the application and
also optimizing cost and performance.

129
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:15,729
It enables, like, dynamic scaling
and also ensures applications

130
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:18,209
respond to real time demands.

131
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:22,599
And cost management, insights
help organizations minimize

132
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:25,949
the cost expenditure while
maintaining the efficiency.

133
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:32,200
And, also, like, like we discussed,
like, AI can also help in enhancing,

134
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,080
the observability and monitor.

135
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,560
Let's deep dive into how AI can
help in, in the monitoring, and

136
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,820
also the observability world.

137
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,049
So one of the couple of common
features that AI monitors application

138
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,909
performance, detecting the bottlenecks
and suggesting improvements.

139
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,650
It identifies the anomalies, alerting
teams to issues like early on,

140
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:00,330
like before it actually occurs,
and also it can help, giving like

141
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,640
a RCA, that root cause analysis.

142
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,580
Speeds up the troubleshooting
that using the downtime.

143
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:10,110
And also one other example is like, if
you want to have like an RCA for your

144
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,340
application, like if you had like a
production outage and you don't have to

145
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:20,434
sit and write the whole RCA, and if you
have like a tools, like AI, where it has

146
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,474
the ability to monitor your application.

147
00:09:23,474 --> 00:09:27,134
It can actually provide you like
insights based upon the outage.

148
00:09:27,614 --> 00:09:32,124
And also like lastly, not lastly,
I think let's discuss about, how AI

149
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:36,695
can help like, streamlining testing
and also, quality insurance, right?

150
00:09:37,055 --> 00:09:42,485
So AI generates like test cases for
ensuring comprehensive coverage.

151
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,920
It also automates test
execution, providing faster

152
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,400
feedback and also saving time.

153
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,780
Predictive, quality analysis,
identifies potential issues

154
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,999
before they affect production.

155
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:01,930
And, and also let's talk about, like, how,
like, you know, we can collaborate and

156
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:05,380
also ethical consideration in AI adoption.

157
00:10:05,925 --> 00:10:10,775
So, overall, like, ethical and
governance considerations, like,

158
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,935
these are the key areas, right?

159
00:10:11,935 --> 00:10:16,265
Because the data privacy and also the
fairness and the transparency is one

160
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:19,805
of the key areas we have to maintain
for the governance considerations.

161
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:23,535
So, in talking about the data
privacy, ensuring data is responsibly

162
00:10:23,535 --> 00:10:25,895
handled to comply with regulations.

163
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:31,620
And also, we have to mitigate the AI
basis to avoid discriminatory practices.

164
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:37,050
And also, we have to build
the AI models to foster trust

165
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,830
and also the accountability.

166
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:44,540
And also, let's talk about
like, how the future of the AI

167
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,230
