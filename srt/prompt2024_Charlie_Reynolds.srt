1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,369
Hi there, folks.

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:05,410
Welcome to my little presentation
on prompt engineering.

3
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:06,790
My name is Charlie Reynolds.

4
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:07,880
I'm a fractional CTO.

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,170
a big fan of AI, and very
keen on prompt engineering.

6
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:16,689
So let's dive into a little presentation

7
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:18,909
just by way of introduction then.

8
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:22,379
So just like in life,
you get what you ask for.

9
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,969
So if you ask good questions,
you'll get good answers.

10
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:27,379
And if you don't, then the saying follows.

11
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:33,419
and for me, I think asking
clear and imaginative questions

12
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:36,089
leads to some interesting
results and some useful results.

13
00:00:36,589 --> 00:00:40,559
And that unlocks a lot of
good capability from AI.

14
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:44,129
There's also, beyond that,
you've also got AI orchestration,

15
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:45,869
which you're going to touch on.

16
00:00:46,419 --> 00:00:50,829
And that's where you use multiple
specialized AIs to work together.

17
00:00:51,474 --> 00:00:54,034
to do various jobs in concert.

18
00:00:54,534 --> 00:00:57,354
this is a quote that I
quite like by Einstein.

19
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,384
imagination is more
important than knowledge.

20
00:00:59,724 --> 00:01:03,164
there's a little bit more context to
this, but I think, the gist of it for

21
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:09,024
what we're looking at right now is
that by not just giving very specific

22
00:01:09,024 --> 00:01:11,854
instructions where you're looking for
very specific results, but using a

23
00:01:11,854 --> 00:01:16,354
little bit of creativity can actually
get you to some innovative outcomes.

24
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:20,374
so with artificial intelligence, I
think this is now particularly poignant.

25
00:01:20,864 --> 00:01:23,864
so the technical knowledge and skills
are obviously crucial in order to

26
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,694
build AI, and evolve it and so forth.

27
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:30,254
But I think a little bit
of human, imagination and

28
00:01:30,254 --> 00:01:31,904
ingenuity can go a long way.

29
00:01:32,454 --> 00:01:35,324
so when it comes to prompt
engineering, asking the right

30
00:01:35,324 --> 00:01:36,464
questions in the right way.

31
00:01:36,974 --> 00:01:42,124
we'll get you to some very useful
and valuable outcomes on, as I say,

32
00:01:42,224 --> 00:01:44,134
a bit of imagination goes a long way.

33
00:01:44,634 --> 00:01:48,914
in terms of what we mean by prompt
engineering, in simple terms, it's

34
00:01:48,914 --> 00:01:52,464
about designing effective instructions
that get you effective results.

35
00:01:52,855 --> 00:01:57,455
so asking the right questions,
thereby unlocking value.

36
00:01:57,935 --> 00:02:00,775
and, it supports effective interaction.

37
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:04,855
So in terms of some key concepts,
as I say, it's not just about

38
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:06,015
the technical skill set.

39
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:09,334
It's also about some creativity
as well as precision.

40
00:02:09,824 --> 00:02:14,244
and rather than just talking to AI
about what we already know about,

41
00:02:14,649 --> 00:02:19,439
It's also asking ourselves, to use our
imagination, look at what is possible.

42
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:24,009
and that therefore means that by the
two of you combining those skills of

43
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:29,339
using human ingenuity with the vast
amounts of knowledge that AI can

44
00:02:29,339 --> 00:02:34,229
tap into, you can get to some new
possibilities and new innovations.

45
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:42,129
So by way of examples, then, instead of
asking AI very short, simple questions

46
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:47,309
like what's the weather, which is
obviously very vague, you should be much

47
00:02:47,309 --> 00:02:51,709
more specific and ask questions along
the lines of, what's the weather in Paris

48
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:53,689
next Tuesday morning for my business trip?

49
00:02:54,155 --> 00:02:56,495
and you'll get a vastly
different response.

50
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:59,745
quite often, there'll be a little, there
can often be a bit of embellishment

51
00:02:59,745 --> 00:03:03,825
as well, where you'll find that,
by adding in little details about

52
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:06,584
the nature of what you're doing and
why you're doing it and so forth.

53
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:10,835
the AI can take those cues and actually
give you more than you bargained for.

54
00:03:11,054 --> 00:03:14,174
it might not just tell you what the
weather's doing, it might also tell

55
00:03:14,174 --> 00:03:17,354
you that, As it's a business trip
in Paris, actually these are some

56
00:03:17,354 --> 00:03:19,884
good activities considering what
the weather's likely to be doing.

57
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:24,284
Or again, you can feed that
in to refine your prompt.

58
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:29,994
and again, that's just a very short,
simple example, but you get into, you

59
00:03:29,994 --> 00:03:32,044
can get into much more complex examples.

60
00:03:32,354 --> 00:03:36,304
with the kind of work that I
do, for example, I often find

61
00:03:36,314 --> 00:03:40,474
that using several different AIs
together can be very effective.

62
00:03:40,764 --> 00:03:43,004
so you can get much more complex tasks.

63
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,879
and that's where what's called
AI orchestration comes into play,

64
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:51,909
where you can find specialized
AIs that you can string together.

65
00:03:52,234 --> 00:03:54,334
we'll dig into some examples
of that in a moment.

66
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:59,064
so things like a system
that generates, text.

67
00:03:59,164 --> 00:04:02,234
So chat GPT is prime example of that.

68
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:05,874
another that would analyze
sentiment and then another that

69
00:04:05,874 --> 00:04:07,754
can actually summarize the results.

70
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:12,824
By putting different prompts into each
of those and taking the results from

71
00:04:12,824 --> 00:04:16,484
each of those and feeding them into
the next AI, you can actually get to

72
00:04:16,484 --> 00:04:19,124
quite a powerful solution that way.

73
00:04:19,674 --> 00:04:20,854
How does that work then?

74
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:23,254
How are we crafting effective prompts?

75
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:27,804
there are many different ways to do
this, and this is just my take on it.

76
00:04:27,854 --> 00:04:31,874
there are some, tried and tested
methodologies out there and some,

77
00:04:32,324 --> 00:04:35,404
mnemonics that you all may be familiar
with, but I'm coming at it from

78
00:04:35,404 --> 00:04:39,054
the angle of using your imagination
and striving for innovation.

79
00:04:39,694 --> 00:04:43,824
There's three parts that I've used in
this, which is clarity and imagination.

80
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,774
clarity is key.

81
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:46,664
Absolutely.

82
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:50,744
But using imagination can
get you a long way as well.

83
00:04:50,854 --> 00:04:54,564
so if you think of yourself
like a director and you're

84
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,034
guiding a bunch of actors.

85
00:04:56,315 --> 00:05:01,654
And you're envisioning and,
imagining the final performance

86
00:05:02,004 --> 00:05:05,784
and then crafting prompts that
lead the AI in that direction.

87
00:05:06,494 --> 00:05:12,354
so again, if we look at AI used for
content generation, for example, instead

88
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:17,294
of saying generate an article about AI,
you might say something more write a 500

89
00:05:17,314 --> 00:05:22,164
word article on AI's impact on healthcare
using statistics from the last five years.

90
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:25,074
And that is obviously much more specific.

91
00:05:25,944 --> 00:05:29,194
the next part is context
and orchestration.

92
00:05:29,674 --> 00:05:34,154
as I say, in more complex tasks,
you might be using multiple AIs that

93
00:05:34,164 --> 00:05:35,544
have each got their specialisms.

94
00:05:35,944 --> 00:05:40,914
and you have to have real clarity around
what it is you're trying to do and

95
00:05:40,914 --> 00:05:44,654
exactly what it is that you're expecting
from each of those AIs, for example,

96
00:05:44,654 --> 00:05:49,124
and therefore they will fit together
neatly and give you what you need.

97
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:54,784
as I much mentioned earlier, you can
have, an AI that can provide summaries

98
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:58,764
of articles so you can take vast
amounts of information and knowledge,

99
00:05:59,044 --> 00:06:01,094
and turn those into succinct summaries.

100
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:05,134
you could then use another AI that
is more specialized around things

101
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:10,414
like bias, and then you could pass
that over to another AI that can

102
00:06:10,414 --> 00:06:12,774
actually pull all that together.

103
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:14,804
So having taken a vast
amount of knowledge.

104
00:06:15,049 --> 00:06:19,729
summarized it, checked it for bias,
and then converted it into a final

105
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:22,279
output, which is, free from bias.

106
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:24,769
and you would use different
prompts for each of those in

107
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:26,599
order to get to that outcome.

108
00:06:27,109 --> 00:06:29,899
and then lastly, iteration and refinement.

109
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:34,699
just as many of you are probably used
to in the world of software development.

110
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,344
iteration is key.

111
00:06:36,694 --> 00:06:41,764
and each time that you put that prompt
through and refine it, then you'll

112
00:06:41,764 --> 00:06:43,594
get closer to the desired output.

113
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:49,654
So again, an example around that
could be that you're using a, chat

114
00:06:49,674 --> 00:06:51,694
bot in the customer service context.

115
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:58,319
And again, you've got, chatbots that
will happily interact with customers,

116
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:02,749
but at the same time, you'll have
a much more specialized AI that is

117
00:07:02,929 --> 00:07:07,259
finely tuned for sentiment analysis,
and we'll be looking to see if that

118
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:08,759
customer is getting frustrated.

119
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:12,909
And therefore, in some cases, it might
decide that actually this is where

120
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:14,909
human intervention would be optimal.

121
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:20,999
so you orchestrate those models together
so that you have, much more, enjoyable

122
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:25,709
experience for the customer and you
have a much slicker AI solution.

123
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:26,299
So

124
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:30,199
why is prompt engineering important?

125
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:31,969
why does it matter?

126
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:37,499
Given that AI is going through
this massive growth spurt, and

127
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,779
it's now becoming quite ubiquitous.

128
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:44,189
the ability to ask the right questions
is becoming more and more important.

129
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:48,549
So prompt engineering enables
us to transform AI from a

130
00:07:48,549 --> 00:07:51,109
simple tool into a collaborator.

131
00:07:51,609 --> 00:07:55,479
and again, this is where I go back
to the idea that Einstein put forward

132
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:57,639
around imagination being so important.

133
00:07:58,164 --> 00:08:00,014
and, it's not just about what the A.

134
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:04,154
I can do, but it's about what
we can imagine it doing, in

135
00:08:04,154 --> 00:08:08,844
fields like health care, finance,
customer service and many others.

136
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:13,394
prompt engineering, as we've touched
on briefly, allows us to orchestrate

137
00:08:13,394 --> 00:08:18,124
many different systems together with
that AI capability, and therefore

138
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:21,174
you get seamless and intelligent
workflows off the back of that.

139
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:27,464
in healthcare, for example, AI systems
can be used to orchestrate patient data,

140
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:30,634
predict outcomes and assist in diagnoses.

141
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:35,804
and obviously the success of those systems
depends on how well they're guided with

142
00:08:35,804 --> 00:08:39,894
the prompts, but also, it's critical
that they've got high quality data.

143
00:08:40,284 --> 00:08:41,544
being fed into them as well.

144
00:08:42,044 --> 00:08:44,524
So moving on to conclusions.

145
00:08:44,694 --> 00:08:49,644
as I say, asking AI about things that
we already know about isn't really

146
00:08:49,644 --> 00:08:51,454
getting the best value out of it.

147
00:08:51,804 --> 00:08:55,814
it's challenging yourself and
challenging the AI to think differently.

148
00:08:56,154 --> 00:09:01,034
and to explore new possibilities, and
asking the right question in the right

149
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:07,944
way, and that therefore opens doors,
orchestrates systems together harmoniously

150
00:09:08,264 --> 00:09:10,564
and leads to innovative solutions.

151
00:09:11,114 --> 00:09:14,944
what I would say is the next time you
interact with AI, don't just ask it for

152
00:09:14,944 --> 00:09:17,034
an answer, imagine the possibilities.

153
00:09:17,414 --> 00:09:21,374
asking the right questions and thinking
about how you might orchestrate different

154
00:09:21,384 --> 00:09:25,594
AI models together to create something
greater than the sum of its parts.

155
00:09:26,054 --> 00:09:30,124
you could even ask AI to help you
with refining those prompts, and

156
00:09:30,124 --> 00:09:31,554
say, how can I make this better?

157
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:34,114
what's suboptimal about this?

158
00:09:34,334 --> 00:09:37,734
give me a crash course in
how to refine my prompts.

159
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,544
there are many possibilities,
around how you can interact.

160
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:47,909
With the AI, which will enhance your
prompts, but it will also enrich the

161
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,299
AI and it becomes a virtuous circle.

162
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,799
So that's all for me.

163
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:56,239
It's just a short, sharp
taste of presentation.

164
00:09:56,299 --> 00:10:00,369
there are many different levels
and aspects to this, but I just

165
00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:03,989
wanted to provide a bit of challenge
around using your imagination.

that's all for me, Charlie
Reynolds of CTR Consulting.

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,259
and I hope that I will speak to
some of you in the near future.

00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:12,159
Thank you.

169
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:12,719
Take care.

00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:13,159
Bye bye.
