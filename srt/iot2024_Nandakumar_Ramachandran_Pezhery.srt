00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,280
My name is Nandakumar Ramachandran Pejari.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:08,959
In this session, we'll dive into how
AI and IOT converge to drive real time

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,390
optimization in multi cloud environments.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,369
I'll discuss key technologies use
cases that empower organizations

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,100
to manage IOT cloud infrastructure
effectively at a lower cost.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,830
In this section, we'll talk about
the industry wide adoption of multi

7
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,620
cloud infrastructure as well as
application deployments And the

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,090
challenges associated with it.

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,839
Now, most of us work at organizations
or have dealt with organizations.

10
00:00:39,274 --> 00:00:43,754
that have started adopting multi
cloud as a strategy going forward.

11
00:00:44,385 --> 00:00:48,745
Now, this is basically because
organizations believe in flexibility.

12
00:00:49,044 --> 00:00:53,674
They would want, they would want to
avoid vendor lock in and also optimize

13
00:00:53,674 --> 00:00:58,064
performance based on applications which
are best built for certain clouds.

14
00:00:58,754 --> 00:01:03,044
Now, typically customers, big or small,
are adopting and placing applications

15
00:01:03,224 --> 00:01:08,714
across different cloud providers
such as AWS, Azure, GCP, Now, again,

16
00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:15,164
the reason for this is to these that
strategy offers flexibility and the

17
00:01:15,164 --> 00:01:20,544
choice to customers so that they can
put applications and infrastructure

18
00:01:20,564 --> 00:01:22,244
on clouds of their own choice.

19
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:26,744
However, it comes at
with its own challenges.

20
00:01:27,374 --> 00:01:31,654
in managing these workloads with
the security associated with it and

21
00:01:31,654 --> 00:01:33,404
the cost efficiencies associated.

22
00:01:33,904 --> 00:01:37,664
Now, do hyperscalers
provide a solution to this?

23
00:01:37,884 --> 00:01:38,754
Yes, they do.

24
00:01:39,254 --> 00:01:43,074
for example, AWS offers something
called as AWS Control Tower.

25
00:01:43,075 --> 00:01:45,274
Azure offers Azure Arc.

26
00:01:45,654 --> 00:01:49,854
Google Anthos is one of the other
platforms that Google provides.

27
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:55,424
But they come with its own complexities
because these tools are meant

28
00:01:56,064 --> 00:01:57,884
for their own specific ecosystem.

29
00:01:58,524 --> 00:02:02,754
And thus, there's a role
for AI to fulfill over here.

30
00:02:03,254 --> 00:02:08,215
On this ecosystem, interconnected
services allow tailored strategies.

31
00:02:08,715 --> 00:02:15,120
For instance, AWS IoT Core enables
edge to cloud IoT data transfer,

32
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,390
while Azure IoT Hub provides
extensive IoT device management.

33
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:27,410
Now, using Kubernetes and service meshes
like Istio ensures seamless integration

34
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:31,230
and orchestration across these platforms.

35
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:36,350
Now, Kubernetes applications tend
to be extremely light because they

36
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,920
don't carry the burden of having
an operating system and thus offer

37
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,080
the flexibility and the mobility of
placement across various cloud providers.

38
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:52,460
Now, there are other services like
AWS Outposts and Azure Stack, which

39
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,960
offer a hybrid cloud experience
and the flexibility to deploy

40
00:02:57,129 --> 00:02:59,064
clouds on prem as well as on prem.

41
00:02:59,494 --> 00:03:03,635
On in a hybrid cloud scenario
that offer the flexibility.

42
00:03:03,635 --> 00:03:07,565
However, again, these come with
its own limitations as well.

43
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:12,975
for example, for on prem or for edge
use cases, these are not purpose built.

44
00:03:13,335 --> 00:03:15,824
They are pretty much seen as a bolt on.

45
00:03:16,324 --> 00:03:21,845
Now let's see how AI can be used to solve
multi cloud IOT related optimization.

46
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:27,034
Now, IOT generates a continuous
stream of real time data.

47
00:03:28,014 --> 00:03:29,254
Now protocols like.

48
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:37,439
MQTT, COAP handle a lot of low latency
edge to cloud communication for latency

49
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:45,589
sensitive data edge computing platforms
like AWS Greengrass or Azure IoT Edge

50
00:03:45,649 --> 00:03:49,549
preprocessed data before sending it
to the cloud for advanced analytics.

51
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:52,239
So while edges are capable of.

52
00:03:53,214 --> 00:03:56,704
data generation, the data
actually gets processed at the

53
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:58,639
servers located in the cloud.

54
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:05,234
The flexibility of finding the nearest
server and sending the data to it to get

55
00:04:05,234 --> 00:04:11,174
it processed is key to low latency when
it comes to IoT centric applications.

56
00:04:11,674 --> 00:04:15,224
Now, not just that, keeping the
applications based on Kubernetes

57
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:20,834
allows for data to be sent to servers
that could actually move across

58
00:04:20,864 --> 00:04:24,934
multiple cloud providers based on
cost and performance requirements.

59
00:04:25,434 --> 00:04:30,774
Now, AI drives optimization
by analyzing IoT data for

60
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:35,334
predictive maintenance, workload
orchestration, and anomaly detection.

61
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,199
Now, services like AWS SageMaker.

62
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:44,669
Azure Machine Learning GCP Vertex
AI enable building and deploying

63
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:45,589
these models across clouds.

64
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:52,829
AI based orchestration tools like
Kubernetes or, for example, like I

65
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:58,169
mentioned earlier, which is pretty much
a larger framework of orchestration

66
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:06,189
ensures real time scaling based on runbook
automation triggered by a specific alert.

67
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,139
These triggers could be based
on data volume at edges.

68
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:16,329
data processing requirements at central
location and completely based on cost

69
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:20,449
to spin up more Kubernetes pods or
even for that matter like, spin down

70
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:24,829
some of the Kubernetes pods when the
time comes to optimize workload on when

71
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:27,689
there is a leaner workload in this case.

72
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:33,589
Now the rise of hybrid AI models
combine real time inference at the

73
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:36,109
edge with cloud based scalability.

74
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:37,769
For example, smart cities.

75
00:05:38,664 --> 00:05:45,654
leverage IoT protocols like LoRaWAN and
AI platforms like Azure Digital Twins.

76
00:05:46,114 --> 00:05:49,214
to optimize traffic and infrastructure.

77
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:54,774
Now, Kubernetes further facilitates
seamless deployment in multi cloud setups

78
00:05:54,984 --> 00:05:59,529
with at least, with the least amount
of manual overhead, to put it per se.

79
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:04,059
as I mentioned earlier, Kubernetes
combined with AI and IoT can simplify

80
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:10,389
a lot of this workload and application
orchestration for most of these use cases

81
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:13,039
that we see today across the industry.

82
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,454
That's it.

83
00:06:15,184 --> 00:06:16,504
Let's talk about agentic AI.

84
00:06:16,964 --> 00:06:22,424
Agentic AI is a term we all are hearing
a lot of a lot these days, right?

85
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:27,094
So let's see how we can leverage agentic
AI to solve some of these Challenges.

86
00:06:27,594 --> 00:06:34,584
Now, agentic AI autonomously makes
decisions based on real time IoT data.

87
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:40,024
For example, AWS Greengrass combined
with, AI models on SageMaker allows

88
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:46,294
devices to, to act locally while syncing
with the cloud for broader insights.

89
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:49,174
That's how it is supposed to be designed.

90
00:06:49,184 --> 00:06:51,424
That's how most frameworks
operate as well.

91
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:55,159
Now, this flow that you see on this slide.

92
00:06:55,219 --> 00:07:00,049
This flow shows the interplay
of IoT data collection, edge

93
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:02,599
computing, and cloud analytics.

94
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:08,129
Now, services like GCP IoT Core
collect real time data, while

95
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:13,479
edge platforms like Azure IoT
Edge handle the local inferencing.

96
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:19,869
Now, agentic AI ensures decisions
are made autonomously at the

97
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:22,189
edge or in the cloud as needed.

98
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:28,099
Now, as an example, one of the large
manufacturing customers that I've

99
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:33,469
been working with, used vibration
sensors and MQTT protocol to detect

100
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:38,069
machine performance and failure
patterns using agentic AI send.

101
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:42,779
And basically they sent proactive
alerts resulting in nearly like

102
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:45,579
80, 84 percent of lesser downtime.

103
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:52,004
Now this resulted in nearly 12
percent cost savings as well as 8

104
00:07:52,044 --> 00:07:53,774
percent of additional production.

105
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:58,334
Now, if you put it into perspective,
if you put these numbers into

106
00:07:58,334 --> 00:08:03,164
perspective of a large production
setup, this is huge, actually.

107
00:08:03,664 --> 00:08:09,384
Some other real world examples include
predictive maintenance using OCP UA

108
00:08:09,384 --> 00:08:15,739
or, for, Also be UA for industrial IoT
and real time supply chain optimization

109
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:17,749
using MQTT messaging as well.

110
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:24,819
Now for smart grid optimization, DDS
enables deterministic communication

111
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:28,799
between IoT sensors and cloud AI systems.

112
00:08:29,299 --> 00:08:33,169
Now here are some, additional case
studies highlighting AI driven

113
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:38,954
solutions, in industries like
logistics, healthcare and energy.

114
00:08:38,954 --> 00:08:45,684
For instance, AWS IoT Core, Azure IoT
Hub securely share patient data in

115
00:08:45,684 --> 00:08:53,724
multi cloud setups, while Google Cloud
AI improves delivery routes with real

116
00:08:53,744 --> 00:08:56,774
time traffic inputs from IoT sensors.

117
00:08:57,274 --> 00:09:02,794
In conclusion, I would like to say
that AI is critical to achieving

118
00:09:02,804 --> 00:09:06,979
real time optimization in IoT
related multi cloud deployments.

119
00:09:07,369 --> 00:09:12,129
By embracing hybrid cloud models and
leveraging tools like Kubernetes,

120
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:19,019
protocols like MQTT and AI services,
organizations can drive innovation, reduce

121
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,929
costs, and gain competitive advantage.

122
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:23,709
Thank you so much for your time.
