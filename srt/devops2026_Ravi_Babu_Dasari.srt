1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,230
Speaker 36: Hey.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,190
Hi everyone.

3
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,120
Thank you for joining me at
conference 42 DevOps 2026.

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,210
My name is Ravi ba Ari from NetApp.

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:10,820
Today I'm excited to talk.

6
00:00:10,835 --> 00:00:15,410
You talk to you guys about scaling
microservices development, a

7
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:21,320
shared cluster for developers to
deploy their work and effectively

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,480
delivering the SaaS work.

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,820
Before we go there, a
little bit, report about me.

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,350
I'm a lead software engineer
and architect at NetApp based

11
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,660
off of Greater Boston area.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,750
So I've been with NetApp around 10 years.

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,400
Been working on SaaS
products from the beginning.

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,730
So I have experience in, developing.

15
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,820
Deploying and shipping the SaaS
products different features.

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,500
I've been working with Kubernetes
from about seven years.

17
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:56,105
So we ship the products like Argo CD
and GitHubs driven rapid deployments.

18
00:00:56,655 --> 00:00:59,805
So we have very strong
platform and everything.

19
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:05,845
So most recently I've been
into more into ai, but this

20
00:01:05,845 --> 00:01:07,060
presentation is a lot more about.

21
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:10,785
DevOps there is a little
bit of AI we will see.

22
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:13,344
So let's just jump right in.

23
00:01:13,844 --> 00:01:14,414
Okay.

24
00:01:14,914 --> 00:01:19,074
As microservices promise, scalability,
modularity, and rapid innovation.

25
00:01:19,224 --> 00:01:19,554
Perfect.

26
00:01:19,554 --> 00:01:21,054
For modern SaaS platforms.

27
00:01:21,594 --> 00:01:25,539
Teams can deploy services independently,
enabling faster feature delivery.

28
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:31,529
But in reality, managing this environments
for development and testing is a nightmare

29
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:34,999
because there are hundreds of services.

30
00:01:35,089 --> 00:01:38,689
Even a small change requires
thorough regression testing, leading

31
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:42,979
to complex workflows, cross team
coordination issues, and slow velocity.

32
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:47,029
Traditional methods just don't
scale efficiently, right?

33
00:01:47,529 --> 00:01:51,399
So in the traditional module,
we have dedicated clusters.

34
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:54,540
We resource waste the
resources because of that.

35
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,170
And provisioning these
services is pretty slow, right?

36
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,290
So let's take a look at your
visual representation of it.

37
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:06,709
Typical, a traditional setup is
you have, on the top you have this

38
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:12,089
cluster with all the services deployed
of say, a hundred services, right?

39
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,579
You deploy a feature branch in it.

40
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,739
You take it for testing, you do all
the development in it and deliver off.

41
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:22,399
Once you're done and you keep doing
it, sometimes you don't do anything.

42
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:27,559
You keep these clusters that's gonna
take more out of your pocket, right?

43
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,309
They come with high cost and
you have alternate approach

44
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:32,779
of say, can rebuilds, right?

45
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:36,069
So let's see why they
don't work as well, right?

46
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:39,819
So they're designed for production
rollouts, not for development.

47
00:02:40,524 --> 00:02:45,804
Because most of, mostly you have just
one can redeployment not as many as

48
00:02:45,804 --> 00:02:49,914
you want or as many feature development
features you're gonna develop on.

49
00:02:49,964 --> 00:02:54,644
And it is complications with stateful
services because when you have a can

50
00:02:54,644 --> 00:02:58,604
rebuild, you can only manage up to
a certain threshold of complexity.

51
00:02:58,604 --> 00:02:59,984
You cannot go beyond that.

52
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:01,364
So that's another problem.

53
00:03:02,174 --> 00:03:04,274
And then what is the alternative for this?

54
00:03:04,424 --> 00:03:07,184
So that's what I'm gonna talk about today.

55
00:03:07,824 --> 00:03:11,864
So we are gonna use namespace
based smart isolation, right?

56
00:03:12,264 --> 00:03:13,344
In a shared cluster.

57
00:03:13,344 --> 00:03:17,634
It provides full safe separation
for any number of feature branches

58
00:03:17,634 --> 00:03:22,554
simultaneously, while still sharing
unchanged services efficiently.

59
00:03:22,554 --> 00:03:25,454
So I'm calling it STDP, right?

60
00:03:25,904 --> 00:03:29,744
It's actually, just the name can
call it anything but the scalable

61
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:31,334
development deployment platform.

62
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:36,704
It uses namespace for isolation and
shared clusters for secure environments,

63
00:03:36,704 --> 00:03:41,604
dynamic routing with the ingress and
with the wildcard routing and whatnot.

64
00:03:41,874 --> 00:03:44,364
And also network policies
and other things.

65
00:03:44,364 --> 00:03:47,424
We are gonna go a little
dive a little deeper into it.

66
00:03:47,974 --> 00:03:50,104
This balance is the
speed, cost, and safety.

67
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:52,324
So let's take a little look at it.

68
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:57,784
So when a developer pushes a feature
branch the idea of ity P is automatically

69
00:03:57,784 --> 00:04:02,059
creates a dedicated namespace and
applies your helm over rights or WhatsApp

70
00:04:02,059 --> 00:04:06,859
or alternative for those and giving
each branch its own URL for testing.

71
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:11,059
So you have single cluster
but multi-tenancy, right?

72
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:15,989
And the proposed architecture, if
you see is so you have those shared

73
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,939
baseline cluster with all the unchanged
services, which are common across

74
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:23,039
all your feature branches, right?

75
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,649
It can be for some, it cannot.

76
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:26,569
It might be unique for some, right?

77
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:30,529
And then you have multiple name
spaces for each feature branch, and

78
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:34,879
you deploy only modified services
are the dependent services, right?

79
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:37,689
So that's the base idea a little.

80
00:04:38,124 --> 00:04:41,814
Simplified, but we will talk a little
more details and you'll get an idea.

81
00:04:42,084 --> 00:04:45,104
So the traffic routing is the key here.

82
00:04:45,224 --> 00:04:50,984
So you use ingress rules, which are
generated and are dynamic and are with

83
00:04:50,984 --> 00:04:55,544
wild card, and you do some flexible
verifications switch routing to test

84
00:04:55,544 --> 00:05:00,264
against staging our production data by
leveraging compatible waste line setups.

85
00:05:00,444 --> 00:05:03,174
So that is also a flexibility, so meaning.

86
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:08,464
You wanna switch between different
databases you can easily do here.

87
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:10,624
So that's also one benefit, right?

88
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:14,534
Without having to do, deploy
or, migrate the databases.

89
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,514
So that's also a good thing.

90
00:05:17,144 --> 00:05:23,949
So on top of it, a web based portal will
make things more easy to use, right?

91
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:25,679
So I have a working demo.

92
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:27,569
I'll show you guys at end.

93
00:05:27,924 --> 00:05:30,354
For now I'm just showing
you snippets, right?

94
00:05:30,484 --> 00:05:31,444
Let's see.

95
00:05:32,294 --> 00:05:34,824
Yeah, so at a high level
STTP has three layers.

96
00:05:35,494 --> 00:05:39,574
A management portal for orchestration
and visibility, a service layer

97
00:05:40,034 --> 00:05:44,714
integrating with CICD via helm and
Kubernetes infrastructure layer.

98
00:05:44,714 --> 00:05:47,354
Optimizing for multi-tenancy, right?

99
00:05:47,924 --> 00:05:50,054
A web-based development
portal simplifies this store.

100
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:54,789
Developers, qa, product owners can create
sandboxes, select baselines, and auto

101
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:59,419
generate namespace and ingress manifest
and network policies that they want to do.

102
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:05,749
And this portal fosters collaboration by
sharing feature previews across the teams.

103
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:09,849
Meaning, people can share their demos
across the teams, they can access and

104
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:11,499
they can see how the new feature is.

105
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:16,679
And just any other shared cluster, and
not just that, but also a place for you to

106
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:19,089
look at all the features find it easily.

107
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:22,899
The approach integrates
with CICD pipelines, right?

108
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:24,189
That's obviously key.

109
00:06:24,369 --> 00:06:29,099
Where baseline baselines, auto
update you keep on updating your

110
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:32,669
baseline services with say production
or staging the way you want it.

111
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,489
And deploy feature branches.

112
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:36,949
Only when you have changes.

113
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:39,109
So there are like basically
these three layers, right?

114
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:44,409
Now just to demonstrate so you
initiate cluster, so names, network

115
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:51,029
policies, ensure feature name spaces
cannot talk to each other, only to

116
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:53,129
approve baseline services, right?

117
00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:56,999
So the idea behind that is
you'll have an isolation between

118
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:57,704
these services, which are.

119
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:00,704
Modifying and they only talk to baseline.

120
00:07:00,704 --> 00:07:07,454
That makes sure that you do not have
collision of services and you keep as

121
00:07:07,454 --> 00:07:09,279
if it's a standalone service, right?

122
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:11,339
So that's the main point
of network policies.

123
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:15,789
You have to make sure that have
that you contain it, otherwise

124
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:18,009
you'll have complicated issues.

125
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,509
Okay, so the.

126
00:07:20,484 --> 00:07:21,864
Payoffs, let's talk about that.

127
00:07:21,914 --> 00:07:26,724
So you have a steam streamlined
development with less overhead because

128
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:32,514
you can just go to that portal, add create
new clusters, shared clusters, and start

129
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:37,494
making changes, push them, having qa,
test them, and review them with the PMs.

130
00:07:37,494 --> 00:07:40,434
And all these things are like,
run the automation suit on

131
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:42,204
it and do whatever you want.

132
00:07:42,204 --> 00:07:43,669
And then at end, once
you're done, you can just.

133
00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:46,019
Simply get deleted.

134
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:49,559
So it's actually cost effective.

135
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:53,059
And the consistency in the
environment makes it easy for

136
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:55,639
you to switch between things.

137
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:59,649
And you also the earlier
I said the database, which

138
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:01,959
is also very useful, right?

139
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:05,854
So the SEC security is
also a good looking.

140
00:08:06,504 --> 00:08:10,614
Up update your, role-based access, your
a Ws clusters and network policies.

141
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:13,284
You can add centralized secret management.

142
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,954
You can make sure that
there is no collision.

143
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,144
So those are the things
you need to take care.

144
00:08:18,594 --> 00:08:24,624
So there are some issues with this,
with the specialist stateful sets.

145
00:08:24,694 --> 00:08:28,344
Some configs are the
secrets et cetera, right?

146
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:32,514
Or you have some S3 bucket
blob storage or whatnot, right?

147
00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:35,515
That is one of the challenge challenges.

148
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:40,914
So the most services are, stateless,
very easy to isolate most of the time.

149
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:45,775
But these services, which are the
outliers like the databases, ces,

150
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:50,665
and block storages introduce a side
effects if they're fully shared.

151
00:08:51,145 --> 00:08:55,525
For example, somebody's trying to
add a new column that is not needed

152
00:08:56,015 --> 00:08:58,590
are they're expecting a certain
column, which does not exist.

153
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,340
Or you are basically
corrupting the database, right?

154
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,880
So that's basically the biggest
problem in a shared cluster that you

155
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,200
might have already thought of, right?

156
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:10,710
So this risk include like data
corruption and interference across

157
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:14,100
the branches, which is not something
you would want to see, right?

158
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,390
That's not exactly how the production
or production with Cango, right?

159
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,320
So how do you balance.

160
00:09:19,965 --> 00:09:24,075
The isolation for a safe
testing with efficiency, right?

161
00:09:24,795 --> 00:09:28,335
So we handle this with
smart change analysis.

162
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:35,535
So the, you scan branches dev branches
the diffs of the dev branches to

163
00:09:35,535 --> 00:09:37,605
detect stateful impacts, right?

164
00:09:38,085 --> 00:09:42,735
If it's just a new endpoint with no
schema change, share the database.

165
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:46,575
If there is a migration, replicate
it to the namespace, right?

166
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:51,315
Tools include namespace, as for
segregation, ingress are service

167
00:09:51,315 --> 00:09:55,505
mesh for routing connect connection
strings and cash isolation

168
00:09:55,505 --> 00:09:57,485
via keys are instances, right?

169
00:09:58,085 --> 00:09:59,375
So automation is a key.

170
00:10:00,035 --> 00:10:05,155
So what I mean by that is, you can
manually select, pick and choose which

171
00:10:05,155 --> 00:10:10,695
service needs to be replicated, which
service can be used by the shared service.

172
00:10:10,795 --> 00:10:15,465
But if you can automate it with AI
now, because the LMS are getting

173
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:21,355
pretty smart and you can write a nice
agent that can pull all the diffs for

174
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:23,035
different repositories and figure out.

175
00:10:23,425 --> 00:10:28,905
How the dependency can be and if
they need to be deployed separately,

176
00:10:29,205 --> 00:10:33,975
meaning any straight full set, straight
full service are, do they have to

177
00:10:34,015 --> 00:10:35,845
do, can they use a shared service?

178
00:10:35,945 --> 00:10:37,925
So based on your change,
it can figure that out.

179
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:41,705
So for example, you have, imagine
you have three services, a front

180
00:10:41,705 --> 00:10:44,735
end and a PL layer, like a middle
layer and a database, right?

181
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,145
So you made a change.

182
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,525
You added a new API.

183
00:10:48,045 --> 00:10:52,875
End point and does not modify or add a
new table or column or example, right?

184
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:57,105
So you can just spin up a new API service.

185
00:10:57,555 --> 00:10:59,865
Don't have to even replicate a UI service.

186
00:11:00,565 --> 00:11:04,255
So you can still use a shared UI
service, shared database service, right?

187
00:11:04,615 --> 00:11:08,035
You can just change the you can just
deploy the a p service, just one

188
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,195
service out of all three, right?

189
00:11:10,225 --> 00:11:14,395
So imagine the same situation
in hundreds of services, so that

190
00:11:14,455 --> 00:11:15,340
would save you a lot of time.

191
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:21,340
So the analysis in a little, if you wanna
visualize it, how it goes is, so first

192
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,260
you start analyzing the code changes.

193
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,860
So find out impactful
stateful services, right?

194
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,630
And then you can figure out which
service needs to be replicated in

195
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:35,880
the namespace, and which services can
be shared from the baseline, right?

196
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,070
And then based on these decisions, you
can create your ingress routing, right?

197
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,740
And then once you decide what
you wanna do, you can deploy.

198
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,660
So this is just a code simple and a
pseudo code to see how we can do it.

199
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:57,540
So figuring out if you have to create a
replica or can you use a shared service.

200
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,940
Yeah, so the platform in, so
for example, this is a dynamic

201
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,180
connection string routing where
we're on a variable injection.

202
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,780
So you can figure out, dynamically
add which route you can use

203
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,380
with the ingress routes.

204
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:16,490
And you can probably embed, you can
play with some environment variables

205
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,490
or you can have your portal or your
service that can add the manual routes

206
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,420
to the ingress, whichever works.

207
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:29,790
So resource quotas, just to make sure
you don't have some bad feature that

208
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,620
is hogging all the compute you have.

209
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,445
Just make sure you don't forget
about resource quotas, right?

210
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:40,090
Just, and that also helps you
contain any damage that they could

211
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:43,780
do in terms of, slow systems, right?

212
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:44,940
As I said.

213
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,780
You'll have to integrate with
the CICD pipeline for this.

214
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,330
So whenever you have a commit
trigger, you can build packages.

215
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:56,900
And as soon as you do that, you can
write an, you can talk to A-C-D-P-A a

216
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,380
PS to deploy the service or the changes.

217
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,490
And by analyzing what needs to be done,
and then you test and validate, you run

218
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,140
your automation suit for that, right?

219
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,270
Yeah, I've been using, by the way
this solution in NetApp in my team.

220
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,960
And it's been quite useful, right?

221
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,550
So it's saving us a lot of time.

222
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,270
The build happens.

223
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,650
You have the major study, as soon as you
deploy it, it's done in a second, right?

224
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,150
There is no provisioning needed.

225
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,870
You don't need to talk.

226
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,700
You can spin up new
clusters on the time of.

227
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,660
All the time whenever you need, and
you can just delete them if you're

228
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,320
not using it, so you just, when you're
testing, you just spin it up or you're

229
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,090
done testing, you just delete it.

230
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,830
You are not gonna keep it for a long time.

231
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,800
So your testing cycles
will be shorter as well.

232
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:49,230
And we are utilizing your resources
at the maximum efficiency possible.

233
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,940
So that's a big achievement, I would say.

234
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,030
So this enhances the
team collaboration too.

235
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,220
And some considerations
we already discussed.

236
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:01,320
So resource quotas, ingress
strategy and data management.

237
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,070
We talked about it.

238
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:07,810
You can add additional logging and
analytics on top of it and observe better.

239
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,280
So that's also something you can do.

240
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,840
So how do you adopt?

241
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:16,340
So before we go into adoption I would like
to show you some demo more quickly and

242
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,405
then we can just talk about some things.

243
00:14:19,105 --> 00:14:20,935
Next steps that you guys can take, right?

244
00:14:21,745 --> 00:14:24,735
So first, let's take a look at

245
00:14:25,235 --> 00:14:26,015
this.

246
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:26,845
You guys can, okay.

247
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:28,185
I hope you guys can see.

248
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:31,345
Alright, so this is I will share
you guys the code for this.

249
00:14:31,975 --> 00:14:33,325
Let's see if this works.

250
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:34,135
No, it's not.

251
00:14:34,345 --> 00:14:36,730
Let me go to my BS code
and start this quickly.

252
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:37,950
If you don't mind.

253
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:38,870
All right.

254
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:43,650
So you can see this, i'm just
reading this existing clusters.

255
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,970
You can see the portal here, right?

256
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:50,350
All right so the idea of this so this
is a portal where you're creating

257
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,040
the dev shade clusters, right?

258
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:58,810
So here I can pick my
feature branch, for example.

259
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,015
User auth.

260
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:04,845
So this is my dev branch, so I can
choose to deploy a service from here.

261
00:15:04,845 --> 00:15:09,825
For example, I choose to deploy just the
front end and the backend, not the a PR,

262
00:15:09,855 --> 00:15:11,685
maybe just the a p not the backend, right?

263
00:15:12,015 --> 00:15:12,855
And deploying it.

264
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,125
So you can see it's gonna deploy.

265
00:15:15,185 --> 00:15:16,685
It's not provisioning a new cluster.

266
00:15:16,745 --> 00:15:19,085
The cluster already exists,
which is a shared cluster, right?

267
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:21,575
So you can see now my demo
is up and running already.

268
00:15:22,075 --> 00:15:23,965
Okay, so I launched it.

269
00:15:24,595 --> 00:15:25,795
Let's see, what are we gonna get?

270
00:15:26,365 --> 00:15:31,615
So you can see it says, I have deployed
a frontend service, which is user

271
00:15:31,615 --> 00:15:33,985
auth and it has a backend service.

272
00:15:33,985 --> 00:15:37,045
So let's figure out which backend
services by calling those API calls,

273
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:40,645
you can see that backend is the
default, which is the baseline.

274
00:15:41,365 --> 00:15:46,375
But the a PA services from user, so
let's take a step back and let's do

275
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,295
the backend this time, but not the API.

276
00:15:48,835 --> 00:15:51,475
So security auth.

277
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:51,865
Sorry.

278
00:15:51,865 --> 00:15:53,365
Security patch.

279
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:55,815
And I deploy this one.

280
00:15:56,175 --> 00:15:57,675
So let's see.

281
00:15:58,175 --> 00:16:00,985
Once we have this up and
running, let's just launch it.

282
00:16:01,485 --> 00:16:01,845
That's up.

283
00:16:02,345 --> 00:16:05,555
Okay, so this is security patch,
and this time let me call all the

284
00:16:05,555 --> 00:16:10,265
services so you can see now this time
baseline, EPA services, the baseline,

285
00:16:10,265 --> 00:16:11,915
but the backing services, security.

286
00:16:12,635 --> 00:16:14,165
Patch branch, right?

287
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:16,835
So UI front end is anywhere.

288
00:16:16,835 --> 00:16:17,915
Security patch, right?

289
00:16:17,915 --> 00:16:21,395
So you can deploy just the backend as
well, but you get the idea now, right?

290
00:16:21,845 --> 00:16:24,635
So now I have the code base here.

291
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:26,135
I'll share the link with you guys.

292
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:29,945
This is just implementing a part of
the solution, but there's more to it.

293
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,345
A real solution requires
a lot more, right?

294
00:16:32,895 --> 00:16:37,245
I can quickly take you guys with
the code, but I think I'll give you

295
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:38,805
access to the code as you can see.

296
00:16:39,225 --> 00:16:42,845
But let me show you another
interesting thing, right?

297
00:16:43,445 --> 00:16:43,775
Yeah.

298
00:16:43,835 --> 00:16:46,745
So this is the rancher desktop.

299
00:16:46,745 --> 00:16:49,285
I'm using my desktop for this.

300
00:16:50,065 --> 00:16:51,685
So you can see the ingress routing.

301
00:16:51,685 --> 00:16:53,275
I just wanna show you an example, right?

302
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:58,065
So we just created those feature
branch features deployments, right?

303
00:16:58,155 --> 00:17:02,175
So you can see that, yeah, the
security patch is deploying both

304
00:17:02,175 --> 00:17:05,595
frontend and the backend, but
the user odd branch is actually

305
00:17:05,595 --> 00:17:07,995
deploying frontend and API services.

306
00:17:07,995 --> 00:17:12,315
Only the routes are in routed like
this, but you also see the default

307
00:17:12,315 --> 00:17:17,505
routing for the API to be the
base API and the backend to be the

308
00:17:17,505 --> 00:17:21,675
base backend so that these feature
branches are routing properly, right?

309
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:22,190
So you get an idea.

310
00:17:22,755 --> 00:17:27,215
So this is the, basically
the magic sauce on top of it.

311
00:17:27,215 --> 00:17:31,015
You need so many layers
anyways but that's the idea.

312
00:17:31,015 --> 00:17:32,845
So now let's talk about
the adoption, right?

313
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:37,315
So adoption is not easy if you
want to do it at once, right?

314
00:17:37,315 --> 00:17:39,055
It has to be in a phased manner, right?

315
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:43,975
So pick and choose which services
are best suited, so put them in the

316
00:17:43,975 --> 00:17:46,195
shared ones, which are easy to do.

317
00:17:46,655 --> 00:17:48,445
For example, you have a UI
service, very easy to do.

318
00:17:48,915 --> 00:17:51,045
Some services, very few dependencies.

319
00:17:51,105 --> 00:17:51,915
They're easy to do.

320
00:17:51,975 --> 00:17:56,265
There's some which are ful ones,
you wanna replicate them until you

321
00:17:56,265 --> 00:18:00,415
get to a position where you can
actually share them as well, right?

322
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:03,735
And then you automate it.

323
00:18:04,095 --> 00:18:07,215
You add the security and all the
things, and then keep scaling it.

324
00:18:07,575 --> 00:18:08,835
Migrate one service at a time.

325
00:18:09,335 --> 00:18:09,815
Yeah.

326
00:18:09,865 --> 00:18:12,595
So this definitely transforms
the development workflow.

327
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:17,040
It definitely is gonna be very
useful for all the people.

328
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:24,380
And I have been using the solution that
I deploy across the teams Q and pmm.

329
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,890
They've been very happy with this and
I've been maintaining it from six years.

330
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,870
Keep on doing patches and updates.

331
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,310
The solution that I proposed is a
lot more complex one in this demo.

332
00:18:34,995 --> 00:18:37,865
In this presentation, but, I
think that you get the idea.

333
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:38,495
Okay.

334
00:18:39,305 --> 00:18:43,925
So your DA deployment portal is the
key, your command center for you.

335
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:47,895
You can make it, custom
tailored for you, right?

336
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:51,425
And then, yeah I think the
remaining slides are, pretty

337
00:18:52,355 --> 00:18:53,705
much what we spoke earlier.

338
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:57,355
The demo you have seen just now,
and if you have any questions.

339
00:18:57,785 --> 00:19:04,465
Do definitely send them across
to me, either via LinkedIn or my

340
00:19:04,465 --> 00:19:10,595
Twitter or ex. So yeah, it was nice
presenting my idea to you guys.

341
00:19:10,595 --> 00:19:11,915
I hope you like it.

342
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:16,135
If you have any feedback it is very
valuable to me, do share with me.

343
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:17,215
Thank you so much.
