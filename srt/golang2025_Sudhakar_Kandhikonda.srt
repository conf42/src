00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,610
Hi, my name is Kar Kda.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,189
I have overall 18 years of IT experience
specializing in, data warehousing

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:09,670
and, data engineering background.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,719
Today I'm very excited to talk
about AI powered ETL, in the Golan

5
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:17,244
2025 conference without much delay.

6
00:00:17,695 --> 00:00:19,205
Let's dig deep into that.

7
00:00:19,705 --> 00:00:23,019
AI powered ETL transforming
data with smarter pipelines.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,779
The traditional extract transform.

9
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:31,329
And Load Paradigm is undergoing a
revolutionary transformation through

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,129
artificial intelligence integration.

11
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,319
AI technologies are fundamentally
re-imagining each phase of ETL

12
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:42,190
Lifecycle, creating adaptive
and intelligent data pipelines

13
00:00:42,729 --> 00:00:45,129
capable of autonomous operations.

14
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:51,910
Modern AI enhanced ETL systems transcend
conventional rule-based approaches by

15
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,989
implementing self-healing mechanisms
that anticipate and resolve failures

16
00:00:56,349 --> 00:00:59,739
adaptive to transformation engines
that learn from historical patterns

17
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:05,410
and intelligent loading strategies that
optimize data placement based on usage

18
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,449
patterns and business requirements.

19
00:01:07,949 --> 00:01:11,700
The data explosion challenge
India leads AI adoption.

20
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,720
Around 59% of Indian enterprises actively
deploy AI in their business operations

21
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,720
considerably higher than 42% of the
global average exponential data growth.

22
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:32,580
India's data creation will grow at
A-C-H-E-R of 29.7, percentage from 22 from

23
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,170
estimated three pointes by.

24
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,230
Operational inefficiencies.

25
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:44,410
Indian enterprises spend close to 43.8
percentage of total data analysis time

26
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:51,070
solely on data preparation activities
with 72.3 percentage of data engineers

27
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,090
dedicating more than half of their working
hours to troubleshooting traditional ET l

28
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,250
systems originally designed when gigabyte
scale data warehouses were considered.

29
00:02:02,535 --> 00:02:06,615
Substantial fundamentally cannot
scale to accommodate this explosive

30
00:02:06,615 --> 00:02:10,695
growth without significant AI
enhancement and re-imagination,

31
00:02:11,195 --> 00:02:12,965
some quantifiable benefits.

32
00:02:13,955 --> 00:02:19,445
A 76.4 percentage of processing
efficiency, 83.7, percentage of error

33
00:02:19,445 --> 00:02:26,395
reduction, 2.34 millions of annual savings
for each enterprise through minimized

34
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:28,495
error handling and optimized operations.

35
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:34,380
And 87.3 percentage of prediction
accuracy, a comprehensive of 2024

36
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,710
study published in the prestigious
journal Decision support Systems

37
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,720
meticulously analyzed 2 87 enterprise
data integration implementations

38
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,820
across diverse industry sectors.

39
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,890
This landmark research provides
compelling evidence of the transformative

40
00:02:49,175 --> 00:02:53,420
economic and operational advantages
delivered by AI powered ETL

41
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,880
solutions in enterprise environments.

42
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:02,200
The technical architecture of AI
enhanced ETL, there are four main phases.

43
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,740
Data ion layer is the very first phase.

44
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,320
It processes 17 different data formats
simultaneously, including complex

45
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:17,020
semi-structured formats like nested JSON
and industry specific EDI variance, phase

46
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,690
number two, machine learning subsystem.

47
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:25,885
Transformer based models achieve
90, 94 0.7 accuracy in predicting

48
00:03:25,945 --> 00:03:30,025
optimal transformational path for
previously unseen data structures.

49
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:35,475
step number three, metadata
repository organizations maintaining

50
00:03:35,475 --> 00:03:41,085
comprehensive metadata experienced
217 percentage higher overall pipeline

51
00:03:41,175 --> 00:03:44,350
reliability to those limited metadata.

52
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,140
Four.

53
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:52,525
Self-healing mechanisms reduced
average downtime of 6.4 hours per ETL

54
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:57,805
in traditional systems to just 23.7
minutes in AI enhanced pipelines.

55
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:01,445
Some of the implementation
challenges and solutions, the

56
00:04:01,445 --> 00:04:02,915
first one being the technical debt.

57
00:04:03,755 --> 00:04:09,365
The average large organization maintains
7,842 unique transformational scripts

58
00:04:09,695 --> 00:04:14,105
with 43.2 percentage containing hardcoded
business logic that has not been

59
00:04:14,105 --> 00:04:17,855
reviewed in over 18 months, creating
significant migration complexity.

60
00:04:18,355 --> 00:04:20,245
Number two, we have skill gaps.

61
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:26,155
67.8 percentage of organizations
site insufficient a ML expertise as

62
00:04:26,155 --> 00:04:30,295
a significant barrier to adoption,
despite India's reputation as

63
00:04:30,295 --> 00:04:31,975
a global technology talent hub.

64
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,930
Number three, data governance.

65
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:41,260
91.7 percentage of organizations
report increased regulatory scrutiny

66
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,850
or automated data processes with
regulatory complaints, costs increasing

67
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:51,370
by an average of 27.3 percentage in the
first year following AI implementation.

68
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,115
Successful implementations typically
follow methodical approaches informed by.

69
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:03,380
Empirical research focusing on metadata
enrichment, targeted use cases and

70
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,430
hybrid approaches that maintain
critical manual processes while

71
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:13,810
gradually expanding AI capabilities,
smarter extraction with ai, intelligent

72
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,185
source detection organizations,
leveraging machine learning for source

73
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:22,840
discovery catalog, and integrated
new data sources 7.3 times faster

74
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,850
than those using traditional methods.

75
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,280
With 81 percentage of surveyed enterprises
reporting capability to onboard new

76
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,300
structured data sources in less than
three business days, adaptive scheduling,

77
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,070
AI driven workload balancing, reduced
soul system performance impact by

78
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:44,020
46.3 percentage, while simultaneously
increasing extraction throughput

79
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,110
by 32.8 percentage with dynamic
workload adaption resulting in a 51.7

80
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,300
percentage reduction in computing costs.

81
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,070
Format recognition.

82
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:59,530
Modern deep learning approaches can
identify and pass previously unseen

83
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:05,680
data formats with 93.7 accuracy
after being trade on just 2225.

84
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,330
A representative examples,
transformation with machine learning.

85
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,570
We have three categories here.

86
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,580
The first one being pattern recognition.

87
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,040
Machine learning identifies and automates
82.3 percentage of transformations

88
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,120
that follow recurring patterns through
unsupervised learning techniques.

89
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,640
Anomaly detection, AI powered anomaly
detection has reduced data quality

90
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,950
issues in production environments
by 76.8 percentage dramatically

91
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,990
improving downstream reliability.

92
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,465
Number three, predictive cleansing.

93
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,135
Advanced in simple models.

94
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:45,265
Combining multiple ML approaches
automatically resolved 86.7%

95
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:48,505
of data quality issues that
previously required manual.

96
00:06:49,005 --> 00:06:53,835
Traditional E transformation phases
rely on rigid rule-based logic

97
00:06:54,075 --> 00:06:56,685
requiring constant maintenance
as business needs evolve.

98
00:06:57,405 --> 00:07:00,975
Machine learning fundamentally
reimagines this approach, creating

99
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:04,725
intelligent adaptive transformations
that not only respond to changing data

100
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:10,005
characteristics, but also anticipate
and address potential issues before

101
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:11,865
they impact business operations.

102
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,205
Intelligent loading.

103
00:07:13,705 --> 00:07:15,865
we have three phases here.

104
00:07:16,195 --> 00:07:18,475
The first one being
optimal target selection.

105
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:21,835
It gives 5.3 times
better query performance.

106
00:07:22,045 --> 00:07:24,475
The second one being dynamic partitioning.

107
00:07:24,935 --> 00:07:29,075
it gives 67.8 improvement,
in query performance.

108
00:07:29,495 --> 00:07:33,995
And the third one being realtime
optimization, where, it gives

109
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:38,795
around 81.4 percentage reduction
in loading related insurance.

110
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:43,100
The loading phase has evolved
from basic data movement into a

111
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,720
sophisticated decision making ecosystem
that strategically determines how,

112
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,210
when and where data is persisted.

113
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,760
Modern AI algorithms have
revolutionized these traditionally

114
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:00,445
straightforward processes, enabling
systems to make complex context aware

115
00:08:00,645 --> 00:08:04,365
decisions that dramatically enhance
downstream analytical capabilities.

116
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:09,065
Organizations implementing AI and he
loading capabilities have experienced

117
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:15,305
remarkable results around 62.4 percentage
boost in query performance against loaded

118
00:08:15,305 --> 00:08:20,075
data at a 47.8 percentage reduction in
storage costs through intelligent data

119
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:21,905
placement and organization strategies.

120
00:08:22,505 --> 00:08:26,405
These translate directly
to faster insights and

121
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:28,355
significant operational savings.

122
00:08:28,855 --> 00:08:30,745
AI powered self-healing pipelines.

123
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:32,975
it has three main, steps.

124
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:37,535
The first one being predictive monitoring,
where the neural network models strain on

125
00:08:37,715 --> 00:08:43,115
telemetry data correctly predicted 91.3
percentage of data integration failures

126
00:08:43,325 --> 00:08:45,065
before they impacted downstream systems.

127
00:08:45,755 --> 00:08:48,215
Number two, being the
automatic correct two actions.

128
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:54,170
76.4 percentage of integration
failures followed recognizable patterns

129
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,800
that could be addressed through
predefined remediation strategies.

130
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,470
Number three, being continuous learning.

131
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:06,319
Self-healing systems showed a 42.3
percentage higher autonomous resolution

132
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:11,750
rate using reinforcement learning compared
to simpler machine learning approaches,

133
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,665
perhaps the most revolutionary.

134
00:09:15,165 --> 00:09:20,444
Aspect of AI and he ETL is the
development of self-healing pipelines.

135
00:09:20,744 --> 00:09:25,334
Traditional ETL workflows often fail
when encountering unexpected data

136
00:09:25,724 --> 00:09:30,854
formats or system issues requiring
manual intervention, organizations

137
00:09:30,885 --> 00:09:34,665
implementing AI powered pipeline
resilience capabilities experienced,

138
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:39,604
79.3 percentage reduction in insurance
tickets requiring human resolution,

139
00:09:40,104 --> 00:09:41,754
implementation considerations.

140
00:09:42,684 --> 00:09:46,614
Skills development, metadata,
foundation, high value use cases,

141
00:09:46,914 --> 00:09:52,494
feedback mechanisms, balanced automation
organizations looking to implement AI

142
00:09:52,824 --> 00:09:57,774
Enhanced ETL should consider several
critical factors to maximize success,

143
00:09:57,774 --> 00:10:02,154
probability, and business values,
starting with high value use cases.

144
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:07,014
Builds momentum through demonstrable
business impact building.

145
00:10:07,014 --> 00:10:11,304
A robust metadata foundation provides
the essential context for AI systems

146
00:10:11,574 --> 00:10:12,984
to make intelligent decisions.

147
00:10:13,794 --> 00:10:16,914
Implementing feedback mechanisms
enables continuous improvement.

148
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:22,194
Without explicit reprogramming balancing
automation with human oversight,

149
00:10:22,194 --> 00:10:24,384
ensure appropriate governance and.

150
00:10:24,884 --> 00:10:28,154
Investing in skills development
creates the organizational

151
00:10:28,154 --> 00:10:32,774
capability required to leverage those
powerful technologies effectively.

152
00:10:33,274 --> 00:10:37,624
future discussions in AI powered
ETL, reinforcement Learning for

153
00:10:37,624 --> 00:10:44,644
Optimization by 2027, approximately 67
percentage of enterprise integration

154
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,535
environments will incorporate.

155
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:51,619
Reinforcement learning capabilities for
continuous optimization, representing a

156
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:56,839
8.3 fold increase from current adoption
rates, natural language interfaces.

157
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:02,329
By 2028, approximately 62 percentage
of enterprises will offer natural

158
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:06,559
language capabilities for basic
integration tasks, expanding the

159
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:12,529
population of integration creators by
7.3 times autonomous data ecosystems.

160
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:18,514
By 2030, approximately 47 percentage of
enterprises will implement substantial

161
00:11:18,514 --> 00:11:23,134
ecosystem autonomy for non-critical
data domains, potentially reducing total

162
00:11:23,134 --> 00:11:25,175
cost of ownership by over 70 percentage.

163
00:11:26,134 --> 00:11:30,574
The integration of AI into EDL
processes continues to evolve

164
00:11:30,574 --> 00:11:32,045
rapidly with several emerging trends.

165
00:11:32,545 --> 00:11:36,175
Transform how organizations manage
their data integration workflows.

166
00:11:36,805 --> 00:11:40,555
These develop a future where data
integration becomes substantially

167
00:11:40,555 --> 00:11:44,694
more efficient, more reliable,
and more accessible to a broader

168
00:11:44,964 --> 00:11:47,364
population of business users.

169
00:11:47,864 --> 00:11:52,214
that's all for me and thank you so
much for giving me an opportunity

170
00:11:52,214 --> 00:11:54,134
to talk about AI powered.
