00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,280
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:06,549
I am pri today I'll be walking you
through how cloud native technologies

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,100
can fundamentally reshape EV charging.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,540
The goal is to show how we can
scale, optimize, and make charging

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:18,070
smarter, supporting not only drivers,
but also the grid and the broader

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,930
push towards sustainable mobility.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,890
Before we dive into technology,
let me introduce myself.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,530
My name is Pri Ali, and I'm currently
working as a senior technical program

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,210
manager at Ford Motor Company.

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,220
With my nine plus years of experience,
I have been fortunate to lead several

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,270
initiatives at Ford and other companies
that bring together cloud native

12
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,010
infrastructure and electric mobility.

13
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,879
My background is in scalable systems
and program management, which means

14
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,970
that I sit at the intersection
of technology and execution.

15
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,740
This helps me help businesses turn
strategy into working infrastructure.

16
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,760
My focus has been on making ev
charging not just available, but

17
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,749
intelligent and user friendly
from an educational standpoint.

18
00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:06,020
I have a bachelor's and a master's
in electrical engineering, and I'm

19
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,240
pursuing my PhD in systems engineering.

20
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,399
As far as cloud native infrastructure
goes, this is becoming more important than

21
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:17,020
ever because ev adoption is accelerating
faster than an infrastructure can keep up.

22
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,280
Last year alone, 14 million
EVs were sold globally.

23
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,570
That's a huge leap.

24
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,039
Nearly one in five cars were
sold worldwide and electric.

25
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,040
This shift is more than a trend,
it's a revolution in mobility, but

26
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,645
with it comes new expectations.

27
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:38,460
Drivers need reliable, predictable
charging, just as they have always

28
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,350
expected gas stations to be available.

29
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:43,679
Without scalable infrastructure
adoption could slow.

30
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:48,360
So the challenge is not just to build
more chargers, but to build smarter ones.

31
00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:52,050
And that brings us to the reality
of today's charging infrastructure

32
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,850
and the pain pointed faces.

33
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,999
There are three main hurdles
that I would like to call out.

34
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,890
The first one is scalability.

35
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:03,570
Traditional networks weren't designed for
exponential growth or global coverage.

36
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,880
Secondly is grid integration.

37
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:12,269
Legacy systems don't adapt well to dynamic
load management or to renewable energy.

38
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:18,840
And thirdly, user experience range anxiety
remains because availability is patchy.

39
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,230
Visibility is poor, and
downtime is just too common.

40
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,130
These are the gaps that we must
address if EP adoption is to

41
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,720
continue at its current pace.

42
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,519
So how do we solve this?

43
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,579
The answer lies in the principle
of cloud native design.

44
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,640
Cloud Native gives us modularity
and flexibility, microservices that

45
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,239
helps us break down complex systems
into smaller, more manageable

46
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,709
services like for payments, for
routing, user interfaces, et cetera.

47
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,230
Kubernetes that orchestrates them.

48
00:02:49,529 --> 00:02:54,089
Scaling automatically as the
demand spikes and open APIs allows

49
00:02:54,089 --> 00:02:56,429
integration with vehicles, utilities.

50
00:02:57,015 --> 00:02:59,864
And even third party
applications together.

51
00:02:59,894 --> 00:03:05,265
This creates an ecosystem that's a
dynamic, scalable and resilient, exactly

52
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:07,125
what EV charging needs at the moment.

53
00:03:07,725 --> 00:03:11,115
Now let's see how this foundation
translates into practical improvements,

54
00:03:11,385 --> 00:03:12,644
starting with reliability.

55
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:17,204
Charge downtime has been one
of the biggest foundation

56
00:03:17,204 --> 00:03:18,554
frustrations for drivers.

57
00:03:19,035 --> 00:03:23,234
With predictive maintenance, we
can cut downtime by as much as 40%.

58
00:03:23,924 --> 00:03:28,154
Iot sensors that continuously
monitor health machine learning that

59
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:31,994
predicts failures before they can
even happen, and cloud-based systems

60
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:33,469
schedule repairs automatically.

61
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:37,844
The result is fewer surprises
for drivers and more efficient

62
00:03:37,844 --> 00:03:39,524
use of technician resources.

63
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:47,400
Reliability builds trust and trust is
what drives adoption Beyond reliability,

64
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,470
drivers also care about convenience,
and that's where smart routing and

65
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,030
load balancing comes in Picture.

66
00:03:54,885 --> 00:03:57,554
Now cloud services bring
real-time visibility into

67
00:03:57,554 --> 00:04:00,015
charger status and even Q lens.

68
00:04:00,465 --> 00:04:04,125
Intelligent routing algorithms
can then guide drivers to the PEs

69
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:08,024
station based on traffic speed
of charging and availability.

70
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:13,214
At the same time, distributed load
balancing insurers chargers are used

71
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:15,945
optimally while minimizing grid strengths.

72
00:04:16,274 --> 00:04:19,485
This creates a system that
feels responsive put to the

73
00:04:19,485 --> 00:04:21,344
driver and to grid operator.

74
00:04:22,065 --> 00:04:25,544
Together, this innovations
tackle the most persistent worry

75
00:04:25,544 --> 00:04:27,614
for EV drivers range anxiety.

76
00:04:28,114 --> 00:04:31,655
Now with live data and smart
routing drivers don't have to guess

77
00:04:31,655 --> 00:04:33,184
or hope that a charger is free.

78
00:04:33,544 --> 00:04:34,804
They know before they get there.

79
00:04:35,344 --> 00:04:38,164
Routing adapts dynamically
even considering traffic.

80
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:42,034
And on the grid side, load
optimization prevents bottlenecks.

81
00:04:42,544 --> 00:04:46,264
All of this means a predictable
stress-free charging experience.

82
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:51,169
Once drivers stop worrying about being
stranded, EV adoption becomes seamless.

83
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,815
Of course, smart charging
isn't just about drivers.

84
00:04:54,965 --> 00:04:57,635
It also plays a major role
in how we manage energy.

85
00:04:57,635 --> 00:05:01,745
Demand charging patterns can
put immense stress on the grid.

86
00:05:01,745 --> 00:05:02,645
If unmanaged.

87
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:07,985
Cloud native scheduling solves this by
shifting sessions to off peak times.

88
00:05:08,585 --> 00:05:14,405
It uses pricing grid conditions and
user preferences to automatically

89
00:05:14,705 --> 00:05:17,885
schedule charging when it's
cheapest and least disruptive.

90
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:24,245
This lowers cost for consumers, reduces
stress on the grid and benefits operators.

91
00:05:24,515 --> 00:05:25,715
So it's a win-win for all.

92
00:05:26,495 --> 00:05:30,305
And once vehicles themselves are seen
as assets, not just consumers or power,

93
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:32,525
the possibilities expand even further.

94
00:05:33,275 --> 00:05:36,040
Let's talk about vehicle to
grid or V two C as it's called.

95
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,520
This turns EVs into mobile batteries.

96
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,890
Imagine millions of cars
acting as distributed storage.

97
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,390
Cloud native platforms can
orchestrate this at scale, absorbing

98
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,770
excess solar or wind when supply
is high and feeding power back.

99
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:56,510
When demand spikes, it supports
renewable, strengthens the grid, and

100
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,790
creates new value streams for owners.

101
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,990
This is where mobility and
energy ecosystems truly converge.

102
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,500
Scaling this vision, however,
requires a phased approach.

103
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:07,755
So what we can do.

104
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,060
Rollouts typically start
with core infrastructure, the

105
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,380
essential charging platform.

106
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,159
From there, Kubernetes, make horizontal
scaling across sites seamless.

107
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:21,200
Once the network is stable, we can
layer in advanced features like B two

108
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,080
G, AI driven optimization, et cetera.

109
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,969
This waste model keeps cost manageable
and ensures reliability at each stage

110
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:34,159
of growth and scale matters, especially
when we consider global targets For 2030,

111
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:39,679
the International Energy Agency projects
a need for four times as many public

112
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:42,320
charges by 2030, which is very close now.

113
00:06:42,934 --> 00:06:44,224
That's a massive expansion.

114
00:06:44,644 --> 00:06:48,604
Traditional systems would struggle, but
cloud native approaches make it feasible.

115
00:06:49,085 --> 00:06:53,644
They simplify deployment, standardized
management, and allow operators to

116
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:56,374
square quickly while maintaining quality.

117
00:06:56,874 --> 00:07:00,114
This is how we keep pace with
EV adoption at a global scale.

118
00:07:00,895 --> 00:07:04,674
And underpinning all this is
the ability to see, analyze,

119
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,414
and act on data in real time.

120
00:07:06,914 --> 00:07:10,454
Analytics gives operators
visibility into performance.

121
00:07:10,784 --> 00:07:12,644
Consumption and usage patterns.

122
00:07:13,274 --> 00:07:17,714
Edge computing enables faster decision
making, locally reducing latency.

123
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:22,124
Meanwhile, machine learning continuously
improves predictions for routing,

124
00:07:22,394 --> 00:07:24,014
maintenance, and load balancing.

125
00:07:24,614 --> 00:07:28,364
Over time, the network learns and
adapts becoming more efficient

126
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:29,654
without manual intervention.

127
00:07:29,654 --> 00:07:34,219
This leads us to the bigger picture, the
path towards truly intelligent mobility.

128
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,949
The journey unfolds in three steps.

129
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:39,650
First, build a strong
cloud native foundation.

130
00:07:40,145 --> 00:07:44,075
Then integrate smart systems like
predictive maintenance and dynamic

131
00:07:44,135 --> 00:07:48,755
opting, and finally optimize and
scale with real time analytics and ai.

132
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:53,284
The outcome is an infrastructure that's
not just scalable, but intelligent,

133
00:07:53,615 --> 00:07:58,445
capable of adopting to changing demands,
technologies, and user needs to close.

134
00:07:58,505 --> 00:07:59,765
Let me bring it all together.

135
00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:01,580
Thank you for joining me today.

136
00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:04,954
Cloud native EV charging is
more than just technology.

137
00:08:05,494 --> 00:08:08,494
It's the backbone of intelligent,
sustainable mobility.

138
00:08:09,064 --> 00:08:14,224
By addressing scalability, reliability,
and grid integration, we enable a

139
00:08:14,224 --> 00:08:18,184
future where electric vehicles are
not only viable but preferable.

140
00:08:18,934 --> 00:08:21,995
I look forward to hearing from all
of you on your thoughts, and if there

141
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:26,135
are any questions, thank you again
for giving me the opportunity to speak

142
00:08:26,344 --> 00:08:29,914
at com 42 Kubernetes 2025 conference.

143
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:30,484
Thank you.

144
00:08:30,484 --> 00:08:30,544
Bye.
