1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,699
Welcome to my session about dynamic
rebranding in data, scaling content

2
00:00:05,699 --> 00:00:07,560
for co-branding experiences.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,660
So myself, I'm Rakesh Conda, a
solution architect with 13 plus years

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,970
of experience in enterprise content
platforms, including large scale

5
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,549
a EM and a EM guide deployments.

6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:29,379
Today's conversation is for any team out
there managing complex multi-platform

7
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:35,110
content challenges and looking for
a smarter, scalable way to deliver.

8
00:00:37,779 --> 00:00:42,370
So the agenda for the meeting is we
are gonna talk about the business

9
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:48,830
challenge, challenges faced by
business out there and how one can

10
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:51,089
decide a EM Guides is a solution.

11
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:56,079
And what happens when you
implement the a EM guides, a EM

12
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,550
in action and the outcome of the
implementation, the impact and results.

13
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:03,470
We are gonna walk through
all the four scenarios today.

14
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,680
First let's talk about
the business challenge.

15
00:01:08,805 --> 00:01:12,585
So modern businesses are
expected to deliver fast,

16
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:14,415
personalized, and helpful content.

17
00:01:14,835 --> 00:01:18,495
Customers want answers now
in their preferred format and

18
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,265
on their preferred device.

19
00:01:20,715 --> 00:01:24,855
At the same time, internal
teams are being asked to do more

20
00:01:24,945 --> 00:01:30,255
with less, more audiences, more
platforms, but fewer resources.

21
00:01:30,705 --> 00:01:34,995
The challenge becomes how do
you meet rising expectations

22
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:36,375
while staying efficient?

23
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:42,154
Businesses must serve direct customers,
partners, internet employees.

24
00:01:42,154 --> 00:01:44,914
You have many different
stakeholders, many different kinds

25
00:01:44,914 --> 00:01:48,225
of audience who need the content.

26
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:52,395
So delivering the right content
to the right audience at the

27
00:01:52,395 --> 00:01:56,715
right time has become critical
for every business out there.

28
00:01:57,715 --> 00:02:00,175
Play go to be website.

29
00:02:00,175 --> 00:02:06,729
It's p chat bot, mobile apps,
product and even P commission.

30
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:13,954
Every channel has its own
rules for contain and multiply

31
00:02:14,765 --> 00:02:16,174
multi parts and bands.

32
00:02:16,174 --> 00:02:17,434
Few have a product that.

33
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:30,919
You have research ation needs, so without
structure, things fall on all around,

34
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:37,399
which are scalable in certain are not
suitable or, and even sustainable.

35
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:42,874
There is a love current across channels.

36
00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:51,695
So now the CS landscape, the many
organizations, they have too many

37
00:02:54,214 --> 00:02:55,834
because they acquire product.

38
00:02:56,225 --> 00:02:59,165
Each product comes their own combination.

39
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:05,285
And the, their own documentation source,
you end up too many contain management

40
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:16,629
system cycle or depending on what are
if, how comes and has requirements and

41
00:03:16,634 --> 00:03:28,144
in process already, not modular tribal
knowledge, like knowledge cater up

42
00:03:29,144 --> 00:03:35,534
and needs right to have deliver
on channel in for partner and to

43
00:03:35,594 --> 00:03:38,179
different, black from s earlier.

44
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:43,519
Main organizations, they
are still looking up.

45
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:50,359
Mix of old dead semesters and old
publishing processes, lack consistency.

46
00:03:50,809 --> 00:03:59,089
And with any semester you can is click
platforms, whether you need update

47
00:04:00,364 --> 00:04:03,304
the product activation, it becomes a.

48
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:12,379
Without realizing the bending
consistent skin and skin brings

49
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:19,954
a bit what needed is shift a
structured, centralized, and automated

50
00:04:20,184 --> 00:04:24,834
contain data and a guide command.

51
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:27,424
So pending.

52
00:04:28,624 --> 00:04:30,184
Are there any points?

53
00:04:30,184 --> 00:04:33,124
Each part come with a
different requirements.

54
00:04:33,184 --> 00:04:39,499
Parts need the documenting to
be deliver in and required to be

55
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:44,979
delivering, in or in ML format.

56
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:45,389
So with

57
00:04:47,824 --> 00:04:52,254
rebranding or ing with each.

58
00:04:52,964 --> 00:04:57,559
Buffet brings a referred
problem or a different way.

59
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:05,324
Deliver, rebrand, deliver documentation,
omnichannel Indian put to be deliver.

60
00:05:08,084 --> 00:05:14,904
So best say brand require, it,
let's say have who telling practice.

61
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:15,719
And.

62
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:23,629
The tap or chat PT or the technology
resell it, but with different

63
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:28,909
name you can relate GPAI or
AI view in that, the part one.

64
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:34,709
Now, newer product
accumulation, U-I-G-P-E keeping.

65
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,349
Check 18 month, but when

66
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:46,049
all partners to be placed, part
terminology need to be placed and

67
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:49,649
sometimes like you partner require.

68
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:57,309
Than brand guide like our,
have a DT board on e electric

69
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:01,059
company that do re our product.

70
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:04,299
So each brand has a own brand.

71
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:11,914
So our ation change reason
installer change logs.

72
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:19,979
And there the acquisition also can,
current innovation needs to change

73
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,424
and offering may also change, right?

74
00:06:23,369 --> 00:06:25,979
In a product, it may
have different of fear.

75
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,959
And when you sell the product,
have gu set of features.

76
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:34,819
So there is a gap and
document need reflection.

77
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:38,244
And all time perhaps is do not.

78
00:06:39,304 --> 00:06:43,954
End the flat, the least parts in you

79
00:06:46,144 --> 00:06:47,724
in, in Africa.

80
00:06:47,724 --> 00:06:54,649
You may have it in, so like
the volume is score by lot.

81
00:06:55,649 --> 00:07:00,059
So if you rethink about this content
challenge, and if you are trying to

82
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:05,009
solve for this as a team or multiple
teams try to gather and solve it, right?

83
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:10,949
What I would say is tackling this
challenge starts with alignment, right?

84
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:15,269
Stakeholders need to surface the real
issues, whether it's version control,

85
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:18,119
branding apps, or inefficient reuse.

86
00:07:19,094 --> 00:07:24,464
Clarify goals across teams forecast
growth because if the content systems

87
00:07:24,464 --> 00:07:29,954
aren't built to scale now they're,
they'll collapse later or very soon.

88
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:33,779
You may not even realize how soon that
is with the way things are changing now.

89
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:40,469
So also focus on operational efficiency,
agility, data-driven decision making,

90
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:45,499
that's the foundation for content
systems that grow with your business.

91
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:50,779
So the CMS sprawl is real.

92
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:55,549
If your organization has multiple
CMS platforms, multiple branding

93
00:07:55,549 --> 00:07:59,219
updates or inconsistent publishing
processes you are not alone.

94
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:04,604
And this session is one of those steps
that you can take to solve for it.

95
00:08:05,604 --> 00:08:11,695
So modern content demands, unified
governance, automation, and intelligent

96
00:08:12,085 --> 00:08:17,965
re reuse a shift to a smart content
architecture and that's where you

97
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:20,484
begin your road to a EM guides.

98
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:25,549
Like I was saying, a modern system must
start with a single source of truth.

99
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:30,694
Not too many CMS systems, just one
source of truth centralized From

100
00:08:30,694 --> 00:08:37,255
there, it should also support modular,
reusable content blocks, automated brand

101
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:40,015
controls, and multi-channel publishing.

102
00:08:40,525 --> 00:08:45,145
This is exactly what data
plus a EM Guides delivers.

103
00:08:45,564 --> 00:08:49,795
It's not just about writing, it's
about publishing intelligently.

104
00:08:50,814 --> 00:08:53,724
You get a single content
management system.

105
00:08:54,190 --> 00:09:00,460
An omnichannel distribution, your content
is consistent and the maintenance is

106
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,590
centralized to one source of truth.

107
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,440
So why a EM guides, when you
are shopping, like you look for

108
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,000
certain set of features, right?

109
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,240
When choosing a platform, you
have to look for four things.

110
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,810
One structure, two scalability.

111
00:09:17,185 --> 00:09:21,085
Three omnichannel capability
and the ease of use.

112
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:25,610
And if you are trying to bring in new
producers, new content creators, the

113
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,550
learning curve should be like minimal.

114
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:32,305
It should not be too difficult for them
to, start using the system because.

115
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:36,715
You may start with one team, but
it may grow to multiple teams.

116
00:09:36,955 --> 00:09:42,865
So a EM Guides provides all of that
with the added bonus of native data

117
00:09:42,865 --> 00:09:47,845
support partner specific customization
and seamless delivery options.

118
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:52,735
It allows you to manage everything
from one place and deliver anywhere.

119
00:09:53,735 --> 00:09:55,685
So the answer is very clear.

120
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:58,625
A EM guides it is because
it provides all the.

121
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,280
Answers for the challenges
that modern companies with

122
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,040
complex content challenges face.

123
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,940
So how it all works, with a EM Guides
your content lives in data topics.

124
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:21,120
Each one is reusable, modular, and
adaptable data valves on one side filter.

125
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,670
Content for different audiences.

126
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,350
Conditional attributes allow
you to control what appears for

127
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,170
which partner or which platform.

128
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,260
Key maps automate brand swaps.

129
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:42,410
It's one content set that dynamically
gets assembled and delivered.

130
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:48,420
So with a system like this, you
get modular content structure.

131
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:55,680
You can rebrand dynamically for any number
of partners because it's modular you.

132
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,280
You have topics that
gets assembled into maps.

133
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,250
You can reuse and reduce duplication.

134
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,920
Your content assembly is like a Lego.

135
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,880
Lego blocks you.

136
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,990
You take each modular.

137
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:13,910
Module topic and try to build, assemble,
and then, create that user guide

138
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,650
or that troubleshooting document.

139
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:20,570
And with this, you also get a
better version control because

140
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,860
it is built on top of a EM.

141
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,710
A EM comes with a very good
version management tool, and

142
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,150
the maintenance is streamlined.

143
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,360
Update updates are reflected
across all content.

144
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:37,200
It's reused content and the ecosystem
is all unified with a better

145
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:42,360
enhanced authoring and authoring
system and a great user experience.

146
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:48,470
So let's take like I was
saying let's take this example.

147
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:54,030
Where you have a product that,
that multiple partners sell, you

148
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,745
take this example of like at and t
selling your product with a name,

149
00:11:57,745 --> 00:12:01,495
and then Vodafone selling the same
product with a different name.

150
00:12:01,565 --> 00:12:05,615
And obviously there is a feature
gap at and t Mega a. List of

151
00:12:05,615 --> 00:12:09,185
features and Vodafone may get
a different set of features.

152
00:12:09,515 --> 00:12:14,555
There is a product gap, and as you your
product may also behave differently

153
00:12:14,705 --> 00:12:19,295
based on platform for Android, you
may have certain set of features.

154
00:12:19,295 --> 00:12:25,175
For an iOS, you may have a different set
of features, so you, your needs, the, your

155
00:12:25,175 --> 00:12:30,815
needs for customizing the content grows
with all these factors coming into place.

156
00:12:31,815 --> 00:12:36,735
So yeah, if you look at the dynamic
rebranding in practice, let's say

157
00:12:36,795 --> 00:12:42,135
partner A wants Smart Meet as the
product name, and partner B wants

158
00:12:42,135 --> 00:12:44,085
to call it Global Connect, right?

159
00:12:44,085 --> 00:12:45,345
You use key maps.

160
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:50,565
Each partner gets their own key map
and you say Product name is Smart

161
00:12:50,565 --> 00:12:54,735
Meat for partner a. And product
name is Global Connect for partner

162
00:12:54,735 --> 00:12:56,955
B in their own respective key maps.

163
00:12:57,255 --> 00:13:03,875
And that key maps take care of the
dynamic product name swapping and

164
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:07,325
let's say they want a different
logo, different UI screenshots,

165
00:13:07,325 --> 00:13:09,005
even a different support contact.

166
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:11,945
It's all configurable
within your key maps.

167
00:13:11,945 --> 00:13:13,925
No content duplication required.

168
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:17,645
The kind of smart branding logic.

169
00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:23,315
This kind of smart kind, this kind of
smart branding logic scales effortlessly,

170
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:27,055
And omnichannel output with one source.

171
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:32,935
You, when you write documentation, you
keep your first customer or the first

172
00:13:32,935 --> 00:13:35,005
product your main product in mind.

173
00:13:35,455 --> 00:13:39,085
So one source, but
different outputs, right?

174
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,785
Structured content allows you to.

175
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:47,665
Output to HTML, output to PDF
output to js ON or let's say your

176
00:13:47,665 --> 00:13:51,685
chat bots wanted in a different
format, you can deliver with ease.

177
00:13:51,985 --> 00:13:58,555
Each format pulls the same content,
but tailored via presets, the output

178
00:13:58,555 --> 00:14:00,565
presets for each of the channel needs.

179
00:14:00,565 --> 00:14:04,015
I may have one output preset for
Vodafone, another output preset

180
00:14:04,015 --> 00:14:09,375
for bt and another one for Telus,
depending on the partners, your.

181
00:14:10,195 --> 00:14:14,675
Number of presets grow, but the
scale also grows and it's easy.

182
00:14:14,675 --> 00:14:18,065
One click and your output is
generated for each of these partners.

183
00:14:19,685 --> 00:14:24,875
You write once, manage centrally,
publish confidently to every touch point.

184
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:29,565
So how to use data valves, let's say
there are like, like I was saying they,

185
00:14:29,565 --> 00:14:32,665
there are certain features only apply to.

186
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:37,435
In this case, Avaya right one of our
partners and there is certain features

187
00:14:37,435 --> 00:14:39,895
that does not apply to Vodafone.

188
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:44,725
So you have a feature name, you call
it an attribute, and then you exclude,

189
00:14:44,725 --> 00:14:49,755
you have a set of data, valve file data
valve file where you configure all your

190
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,155
includes and exclude by brand rules.

191
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:57,045
And in your output presets
you can link these data files.

192
00:14:57,045 --> 00:15:01,005
So depending on which
output preset it is, it can.

193
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:06,150
Easily include and explore
that piece of content.

194
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,190
And therein you get the
control by feature, right?

195
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,520
You can deliver different outputs
for different partners with a

196
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:20,520
smart use of data valves, key
maps, and multiple output presets.

197
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:27,460
And in this example, if you look at
this I have a product overview for

198
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:32,230
each brand overview written in multiple
different ways for each of those partners.

199
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:36,460
And for each of these sections,
you can tell the first one applies

200
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,420
to partner X, Y, Z, and the second
one applies to a different partner.

201
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:47,560
And that audience attribute allows you
to pick and choose and assign a piece of

202
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,860
content to a specific set of audience.

203
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,080
That is how you use attributes.

204
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:58,880
For different partners and link it's
like tagging the content by audience.

205
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:05,820
So with a mix of all these you have
key maps to manage your dynamic product

206
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,440
labeling needs, tagging needs, and
then you have data vials to control.

207
00:16:11,175 --> 00:16:16,185
Where each of this content goes and what
you show based on platform or audience

208
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:21,715
or partner, and you have output presets
to generate different kinds of outputs

209
00:16:21,765 --> 00:16:27,105
PDFs, HTML or JSON, or eBooks, right?

210
00:16:27,285 --> 00:16:32,685
So once you have a system like
this set up in a EM Guides,

211
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:35,295
the impact is gonna be amazing.

212
00:16:35,325 --> 00:16:37,905
The results are gonna shock you.

213
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:39,135
What takes.

214
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:46,205
Months, may take few days to, get
the same output with and without.

215
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:52,145
So someone wisely said, content
isn't the king, it's the kingdom.

216
00:16:52,415 --> 00:16:57,615
And with the way the digital
content is growing it's at of Atmos

217
00:16:57,615 --> 00:17:00,830
importance today, now more than ever.

218
00:17:03,225 --> 00:17:07,035
So let's say you go ahead with
this solution and it's time for

219
00:17:07,035 --> 00:17:12,315
celebration like you have solved for
the challenges that you plan to solve.

220
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,825
And, all happy faces, happy stakeholders.

221
00:17:17,385 --> 00:17:20,775
So benefits wise, if I go
into the benefits, right?

222
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:26,985
Organizations that implement this model,
they report faster time to market.

223
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:33,540
Lower error rates and smoother partner
Onboarding content is always up to date.

224
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,640
Branding stays consistent.

225
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,360
Teams spend less time fixing
and more time innovating.

226
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,900
The system scales without,
scaling the workload, like fewer

227
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,610
resources, more output put,

228
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,820
and things to remember.

229
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:52,530
If you're dealing with content silos,
inconsistent branding on multi-channel

230
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,750
pain, this approach is built for you.

231
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,720
Structured authoring
gives you flexibility.

232
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:03,270
Smart rules give you control,
and a EM guides give you the

233
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,490
tools to scale one source.

234
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,520
Many faces deliver fast at scale.

235
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,330
Oh, that's everything I want to cover.
