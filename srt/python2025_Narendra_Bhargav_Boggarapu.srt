00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,740
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:04,970
Today I'm going to talk about
revolutionary cloud based fraud detection

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,880
systems and how they are saving financial
institutions 43 billion annually.

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,729
As fraud costs institutions billions
of dollars globally, cloud enabled

5
00:00:14,729 --> 00:00:17,739
fraud detection solutions are
rapidly becoming a game changer.

6
00:00:18,259 --> 00:00:21,769
By leveraging advanced machine
learning, the systems offer

7
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:25,669
unprecedented levels of accuracy in
detecting suspicious transactions.

8
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:26,034
Thank you for listening.

9
00:00:26,415 --> 00:00:29,745
Throughout this presentation we'll
explore how cloud integration is

10
00:00:29,745 --> 00:00:34,245
reshaping fraud prevention, handling
millions of transactions per second,

11
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,695
and providing unmatched security.

12
00:00:37,195 --> 00:00:40,535
Let's begin with the
evolution of fraud detection.

13
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:44,435
Traditionally, fraud detection
systems relied on rule-based methods.

14
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:47,915
The systems were slow, often
processing transactions and

15
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:51,185
batches, taking hours, sorry, one
days to identify potential fraud.

16
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,995
As a result, these legacy systems
had a high false positive rate.

17
00:00:55,845 --> 00:00:58,925
With fraud detection, accuracy
sometimes as low as 50%.

18
00:00:59,425 --> 00:01:02,585
This posed a significant
challenge in balancing security

19
00:01:02,585 --> 00:01:03,495
and customer experience.

20
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:09,035
Fast forward to today, cloud based fraud
detection systems powered by machine

21
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:10,685
learning have revolutionized the space.

22
00:01:11,465 --> 00:01:16,334
These systems can analyze millions of
transactions per second using vast amounts

23
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,664
of data and sophisticated algorithms.

24
00:01:19,174 --> 00:01:23,065
Their accuracy in detecting fraud
has surpassed 90 percent and their

25
00:01:23,074 --> 00:01:27,520
ability to self learn means They
can adapt to new fraud patterns

26
00:01:27,699 --> 00:01:29,240
without manual intervention.

27
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,030
The power of machine learning.

28
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,670
Now, let's take a deeper dive into
the power of machine learning in

29
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,139
fraud detection and data collection.

30
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,839
Cloud based platforms aggregate
massive amounts of data in real

31
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,829
time, pulling from transaction logs,
historical customer interactions,

32
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:46,819
and even global threat intelligence.

33
00:01:47,589 --> 00:01:51,410
This enables the system to build a
comprehensive fraud detection ecosystem.

34
00:01:52,115 --> 00:01:53,025
Pattern recognition.

35
00:01:53,965 --> 00:01:57,935
Machine learning algorithms sift
through billions of data points,

36
00:01:58,145 --> 00:02:02,625
detecting subtle correlations and
emerging fraud patterns that traditional

37
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:04,934
rule based systems often miss.

38
00:02:04,935 --> 00:02:09,975
With an accuracy rate above 90%, the
systems can spot complex fraud schemes

39
00:02:10,074 --> 00:02:11,775
that would otherwise go unnoticed.

40
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:14,525
Real time risk assessment.

41
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:19,685
These systems provide near instantaneous
risk covering, identifying suspicious

42
00:02:19,695 --> 00:02:21,375
transactions within milliseconds.

43
00:02:22,045 --> 00:02:26,104
This allows financial institutions
to block fraudulent transactions

44
00:02:26,215 --> 00:02:29,825
before they are completed, and it
dramatically reduces false positives

45
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:31,895
compared to the older system.

46
00:02:32,395 --> 00:02:33,485
Accelerated response times.

47
00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:36,915
Moving on to response times,
which have also drastically

48
00:02:36,915 --> 00:02:38,455
improved with cloud based systems.

49
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:39,845
Traditional systems.

50
00:02:40,355 --> 00:02:43,585
Legacy systems often took anywhere
from 30 minutes to several

51
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:45,035
hours to process transactions.

52
00:02:45,205 --> 00:02:50,474
And during peak periods, the delay
cloud extend to several hours.

53
00:02:50,974 --> 00:02:52,954
the delay could extend to several hours.

54
00:02:53,154 --> 00:02:57,444
This created a window of vulnerability
that fraudsters often exploited.

55
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:59,114
Cloud based systems.

56
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:02,824
In contrast, modern cloud
systems operate in real time.

57
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:07,649
With processing speeds of just 20 to
50 milliseconds per transaction by

58
00:03:07,649 --> 00:03:11,329
utilizing parallel processing They
can analyze thousands of transactions

59
00:03:11,429 --> 00:03:15,839
every second catching fraudsters
before they can act Slashing false

60
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:20,549
positive a critical benefit of cloud
based fraud detection is its ability

61
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:23,049
to reduce false positives Reduction.

62
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:28,419
Our system has reduced false fraud alerts
by more than 70 percent, which means fewer

63
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:31,959
disruptions for legitimate customers,
allowing them to transact without

64
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:34,009
unnecessary delays or interruptions.

65
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:35,949
Customer Satisfaction.

66
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:40,799
As a result, customer satisfaction
scores have significantly improved.

67
00:03:41,369 --> 00:03:45,009
Financial institutions that use
these solutions report a customer

68
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:49,439
satisfaction rate of over 85
percent due to faster transaction

69
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,529
approvals and fewer disruptions.

70
00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:56,179
Let's take a case study, a
fortune 100 credit card provider.

71
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:58,429
Let's look at a real world example.

72
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:02,944
One of the fortune 100 credit
card providers We worked

73
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,165
with processes more than 1.

74
00:04:05,165 --> 00:04:09,874
5 million transactions per second, which
is more than the New York Stock Exchange.

75
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:14,594
The system handles peak holiday periods
without any degradation in performance.

76
00:04:15,404 --> 00:04:19,624
By deploying this cloud based fraud
detection solution, the institution saw

77
00:04:19,624 --> 00:04:21,804
a 71 percent reduction in fraud losses.

78
00:04:22,724 --> 00:04:24,674
Which translates to a saving of 1.

79
00:04:24,674 --> 00:04:26,504
5 billion dollars annually.

80
00:04:27,094 --> 00:04:31,054
This has not improved their, this
not only improved their bottom

81
00:04:31,054 --> 00:04:34,404
line, but also enhanced their
risk profile and customer trust.

82
00:04:34,904 --> 00:04:36,494
Addressing data security.

83
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:40,304
Let's talk about how data security
is maintained in the systems.

84
00:04:40,764 --> 00:04:41,554
Advanced encryption.

85
00:04:42,504 --> 00:04:46,564
We use military grade encryption to
protect sensitive financial data with

86
00:04:47,294 --> 00:04:51,864
256 bit AES encryption and quantum
resistant protocols to safeguard

87
00:04:51,864 --> 00:04:53,554
both data in transit and at rest.

88
00:04:54,404 --> 00:04:55,784
Multi layered security.

89
00:04:56,284 --> 00:05:00,974
Our security strategy includes AI
powered firewalls, intrusion detection

90
00:05:00,984 --> 00:05:05,234
systems, and biometric access controls,
which have prevented over 99 percent

91
00:05:05,234 --> 00:05:07,114
of unauthorized access attempts.

92
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,094
Regular security audits.

93
00:05:09,784 --> 00:05:14,384
We conduct monthly penetration tests and
quarterly third party security audits

94
00:05:14,384 --> 00:05:18,134
to ensure compliance with industry
standards and maintain certifications

95
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:22,744
such as SOC 2, Type 2, and ISO 27001.

96
00:05:23,244 --> 00:05:26,024
Measurable benefits of
cloud based fraud detection.

97
00:05:26,524 --> 00:05:31,004
And let's now examine the return of
interest of these cloud based systems.

98
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:32,634
Traditional systems.

99
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:37,714
Legacy systems typically offer a low
return on investment with ROI ranging

100
00:05:37,764 --> 00:05:39,744
from only one to two times the investment.

101
00:05:40,324 --> 00:05:44,494
They also incur high maintenance costs,
often in the millions annually, and

102
00:05:44,514 --> 00:05:48,164
cause significant operational delays
taking hours to process transactions.

103
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:49,809
Cloud based systems.

104
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:54,799
On the other hand, cloud solutions deliver
a much higher ROI, often 10 times the

105
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:56,569
initial investment within the first year.

106
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:02,299
These systems not only cut fraud
losses by over 50 percent, but also

107
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:06,869
reduce false positive and dramatically
improve processing speed and uptime.
