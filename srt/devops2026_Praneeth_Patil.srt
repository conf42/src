1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,440
Speaker 29: My name is P Patel.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,080
I'm a senior staff engineer at Equinix.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,660
And today I'm gonna talk about how an
autonomous agent can build multi-cloud

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,730
infrastructure for you and take you
beyond ISC and prompt engineering.

5
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,070
The days of having.

6
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:24,115
All your workloads in on-prem are in a
single cloud provider, are long gone now.

7
00:00:24,115 --> 00:00:28,645
Customers have their training
models in Nvidia Cloud.

8
00:00:28,735 --> 00:00:35,865
They have their data pipeline in AWS
inference in GCP and their secret data

9
00:00:35,925 --> 00:00:38,835
or secure data in in their on-prem.

10
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:42,165
And there is a constant need to
stitch them all together and that.

11
00:00:42,915 --> 00:00:43,605
Complexity.

12
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:47,385
Every cloud provider has their
own tools, have their own way

13
00:00:47,385 --> 00:00:48,765
of orchestrating patterns.

14
00:00:49,245 --> 00:00:51,975
Some call it express connect,
some call it direct connect,

15
00:00:51,975 --> 00:00:53,425
some call it cloud routers.

16
00:00:53,425 --> 00:01:00,205
And these are all confusing jargons and
for DevOps team to understand all of this

17
00:01:00,205 --> 00:01:02,995
and stitch together the network has been.

18
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,290
More challenged than ever before.

19
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,510
Clearly, there are tools for us.

20
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,060
Terraform came up with declarative
statements that said, we will

21
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,260
do infrastructure as code.

22
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,440
It will show what your, you can write
what your infrastructure is meant to be.

23
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:23,470
And Terraform Cloud said, okay, I'll
help you with maintaining the state and

24
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,390
maybe a little bit of reconciliation.

25
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,350
Lummi said, oh, you can write your
own code in whatever language you.

26
00:01:29,615 --> 00:01:34,245
Familiar with, and we'll translate
that to infrastructure score across

27
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:40,345
companies and teams have built Kubernetes
operators and they've leveraged cross

28
00:01:40,345 --> 00:01:44,335
plane to reconcile their infrastructure
because there is always a drift.

29
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,555
AWS said Cloud Foundation can do it.

30
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:53,700
But there is a lot of these different
tools out there, and not one solves all

31
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,990
the problem of easy cloud provisioning.

32
00:01:57,935 --> 00:02:01,175
What comes with all of
this is fear of change.

33
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:06,065
Nobody wants to touch infrastructure
that seems so brittle that you make

34
00:02:06,065 --> 00:02:09,215
one change somewhere, something
else goes out of the window.

35
00:02:09,865 --> 00:02:14,075
There is always in
inconsistencies in reconciliation.

36
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:17,955
Your Terraform states says something,
but somebody did something on the

37
00:02:17,955 --> 00:02:19,485
console that nobody knows about.

38
00:02:19,775 --> 00:02:22,575
States are opaque, hard
to interpret what it is.

39
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:24,625
What it really translates to.

40
00:02:25,075 --> 00:02:26,935
And then there is cognitive overload.

41
00:02:27,385 --> 00:02:33,655
You have multiple different DSLs,
SCLs, APIs and different jargons

42
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:35,905
that people have to understand.

43
00:02:36,895 --> 00:02:38,725
And lastly, the tribal knowledge.

44
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:43,845
We have all been there where you are
at the mercy of another engineer and

45
00:02:43,845 --> 00:02:47,925
you're always hoping that engineer
never leaves because only he or she or

46
00:02:47,925 --> 00:02:50,445
them know what it really stands for.

47
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:57,540
Luckily, yay has come to our sq
lms started telling us how to start

48
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,160
writing these programs better.

49
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,700
But LMS are nothing but
glorified template generators.

50
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,770
And a lot of teams have.

51
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:11,155
Claim to be used LMS and have been
agreed, or having believed to have

52
00:03:11,155 --> 00:03:17,215
jumped on the gravy train of ai,
but we are still limiting ourselves.

53
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:22,075
The real answer is the autonomous
infrastructure agent that understands

54
00:03:22,075 --> 00:03:26,245
multi-cloud, understands the history,
understands the syntax, understands

55
00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:29,935
the correctness, understands
the configurations with minimum.

56
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:32,895
Infrastructure as code with LMS are great.

57
00:03:33,165 --> 00:03:35,595
They speed you up, but
they're very limited.

58
00:03:36,105 --> 00:03:38,895
They can only ate templates for you.

59
00:03:39,105 --> 00:03:41,895
They cannot, in fact put
in all the values for you.

60
00:03:42,485 --> 00:03:45,875
They do not have context
awareness, which means they're.

61
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:50,965
Their response and the templates that
are generated are at the mercy of how

62
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:57,705
good your prompt is, and you have to be
manually re verifying the templates or the

63
00:03:57,705 --> 00:04:03,345
code generated in terms of correctness,
in terms of security policies and syntax.

64
00:04:04,155 --> 00:04:07,655
And there is no operational
intelligence whatsoever in here.

65
00:04:08,155 --> 00:04:13,015
So with my expertise and my
experimentation, I bring this vision

66
00:04:13,105 --> 00:04:18,475
to the DevOps community of autonomous
infrastructure agent that transforms

67
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:24,325
your LMS from passive code generator
to continuously aware system that

68
00:04:24,415 --> 00:04:26,455
understands your infrastructure.

69
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:31,320
That reasons on real time
and makes analysis, it does.

70
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,730
Autonomous actions on your behalf
orchestrates, cloud provider, cloud

71
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,410
constructs, and cloud resources.

72
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,930
It does self-correction when needed.

73
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:47,430
It optimizes your cost, your security,
and any preferences that you might want

74
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,830
your agent to do for your organization.

75
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:56,710
The core architecture is around rag
purpose-built ritual layer index

76
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,660
your cloud assets, configurations,
and dependencies across mul all your

77
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,370
cloud providers, transforming a static
model into a dynamic infrastructure.

78
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:12,220
The architecture pattern solves the
context window limitation and ensures

79
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,190
the agents have up to date information.

80
00:05:15,895 --> 00:05:20,185
And not based on any old documentation
from the cloud providers.

81
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:23,495
Speaker 30: My pipeline is your judge.

82
00:05:24,215 --> 00:05:27,055
Verify, validation, verify.

83
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:28,695
And the correctness

84
00:05:29,265 --> 00:05:32,595
Speaker 29: with terms of relationships
and constraints that you have

85
00:05:32,595 --> 00:05:35,115
put together as an organization.

86
00:05:35,775 --> 00:05:39,465
It ensures all the security
concerns are taken care of.

87
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:43,765
Unnecessary reports are not open,
security groups are not overridden.

88
00:05:44,335 --> 00:05:48,265
And then finally the compliance
check that something that comes

89
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,875
from InfoSec teams, for example.

90
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:54,510
I categorized building this
rack into three main categories.

91
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,440
One is specialized ritual.

92
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:02,330
The domain specific vector will store
infrastructure, metadata, configuration

93
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:07,260
templates it could be prior native
schema, relationship indices, and

94
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,880
then historical change locks will
becomes core reasoning for why a

95
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,290
particular decision has been made.

96
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,740
And then the real time synchronization.

97
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,570
This is where you get your cloud
fails, you get your activity logs

98
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:25,100
any drift detections you might have
set up that feeds into the agent.

99
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,400
And then the guardrail workflows,
the policy agent design with

100
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,330
mandatory checkpoints with human
in the loop for escalation.

101
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,520
When done correctly set an
autonomous infrastructure agent

102
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,380
can accelerate your deployment.

103
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,530
It'll go from minutes, it'll
go from hours to minutes.

104
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:49,340
Crossover orchestration would not
be as complicated and as scary as it

105
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,920
seems, and it becomes more natural.

106
00:06:52,405 --> 00:06:57,785
And the self-healing operations is
where you get bang for the buck with

107
00:06:57,815 --> 00:07:00,225
auto detections and auto remediations.

108
00:07:00,725 --> 00:07:04,775
But that doesn't go with
saying that there are no risks.

109
00:07:05,435 --> 00:07:10,055
You will run into context con context,
window constraints if the window gets

110
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:14,465
too large, but with the special ed
ritual and summarization strategies.

111
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,750
You can mitigate that identity.

112
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,210
Boundary failures, which is very scary.

113
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:24,860
Autonomous agents can get out of
control if not properly managed.

114
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:30,200
If you have least privileged models set up
and service accounts associated with them

115
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,840
you can mitigate that hallucination risk.

116
00:07:33,974 --> 00:07:36,719
LLM agents think as they want.

117
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,120
None of us know how they
really think very well.

118
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:42,359
Having multi-stage verification
that we talked about.

119
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:46,979
And doing dry run validations can
prevent these catastrophic failures.

120
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,170
Agent level access, security
compromised agents can manipulate

121
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:56,820
the production infrastructure,
which is scarier than anything.

122
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,109
For me immutable audit trails
and an anomaly detections

123
00:08:02,109 --> 00:08:04,420
can help us get past that.

124
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:10,230
Now that we know what we need to do, now
it comes down to how we want to do it.

125
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,900
Take a small step.

126
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,990
Start with building your RAC foundation.

127
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,530
Build a strong RAC foundation
based on your infrastructure.

128
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,790
State in your templates the
history, and states, whatever you

129
00:08:23,885 --> 00:08:25,859
might have, and start from there.

130
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,460
Build a concrete verification pipeline.

131
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:35,069
Multi-stage pipelines for syntax
semantic security and compliance

132
00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:36,180
that we discussed before.

133
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:42,480
And then deploy autonomous
agents with guardrails that

134
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,250
are centric to your workflows.

135
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:52,744
Deploy in low risk areas with high
reputation tasks and run it over and

136
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:57,934
see how it performs, and then you can
scale it up with proper governance.

137
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,749
I want to stress this.

138
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:04,060
I cannot emphasize security
and governance enough.

139
00:09:04,869 --> 00:09:10,419
If we want to deploy an autonomous
agent that can run on our production

140
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:15,569
infrastructure, then access control and
auditing becomes the top most concern.

141
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:18,479
Start with least privilege.

142
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:22,844
Assignment model, and they
should always be time bound.

143
00:09:23,204 --> 00:09:27,224
So have multifactor authentication
for your agents through service

144
00:09:27,224 --> 00:09:31,884
accounts segregate execution
environment, workflows between the

145
00:09:31,884 --> 00:09:33,864
cloud providers and your environments.

146
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:35,874
Continuous permission monitoring.

147
00:09:36,254 --> 00:09:39,689
See agents themselves go rogue
and update their permission.

148
00:09:39,989 --> 00:09:45,719
Take up enough concerns and protections
around iams audits and compliances.

149
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:51,389
Immutable logs of all the agent's
decisions becomes core to this.

150
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:52,289
Real time.

151
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:56,819
An anomaly detection on agent
behavior, autonomous compliance,

152
00:09:56,819 --> 00:10:00,889
reporting and regulation in 2026.

153
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:02,749
Infrastructure.

154
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:07,129
Autonomous agents will
start becoming a baseline.

155
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:13,879
If you miss the boat, you will
fall behind deployment velocity.

156
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,259
Incident reduction and cost optimization
is something, are the metrics that we

157
00:10:19,979 --> 00:10:25,709
accounted for, and this is where an
autonomous agent can be our best friend.

158
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:30,679
Infrastructure agents are not a
distance, are not in distant future.

159
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:32,509
They are right here.

160
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:38,089
It is up for us to make the deliberate
decisions to build rack powered

161
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:42,134
awareness, multi-stage verification
and governance agent agent design.

162
00:10:43,124 --> 00:10:50,324
We can try to get for, or look or explore
some of the out of the box agents for

163
00:10:50,324 --> 00:10:55,875
infrastructure management, but they
might not always do what we need because

164
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,495
every organizations are different.

165
00:10:58,055 --> 00:10:59,704
Every requirements are different.

166
00:10:59,824 --> 00:11:04,355
And until, and unless we train these
agents to do what we want for our

167
00:11:04,355 --> 00:11:06,905
organization, we will always fall behind.

168
00:11:07,685 --> 00:11:08,435
So take that step.

169
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:14,415
With that, I thank Con 42 and DevOps
conference for giving me this opportunity.

170
00:11:14,415 --> 00:11:15,765
I hope you all enjoyed my talk.
