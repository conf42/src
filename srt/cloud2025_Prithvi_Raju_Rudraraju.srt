00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,150
Hello, good morning and welcome to
Conference 42, Cloud Native 2025.

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:11,630
My name is Krithvi and we are going
to discuss today about demystifying

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,419
cloud technologies, harnessing scalable
data analytics for enterprise growth.

4
00:00:16,919 --> 00:00:22,010
So today we are going to discuss
about cloud technologies and how we

5
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:27,970
can, how enterprises can leverage
the advantage of cloud computing and,

6
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,700
and then, improve their business.

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,540
Transform your businesses with
cloud powered data analytics.

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,090
Discover how modern cloud solutions can
drive innovation, optimize operations,

9
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,120
and accelerate your enterprise
digital transformation journey.

10
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,509
cloud computing, so it comes
as, as a package components.

11
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,189
So main components are
infrastructure as a service.

12
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:54,039
Platform as a service.

13
00:00:54,959 --> 00:01:00,210
Cloud compute technologies are
revolutionizing how enterprises

14
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,719
handle process and extract
value from data analytics.

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,749
So real time analytics
organizations can now analyze.

16
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:16,289
data in real time, enabling instant
business insights and data driven

17
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:21,800
decision making as infrastructure
as a service enterprises, enterprise

18
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:26,699
grade computing resources on demand,
offering scalable virtual machines

19
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,340
and stories that grow with your needs.

20
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,590
so in this enterprises
need not to investor.

21
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,880
Much on their infrastructure.

22
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,040
So they just, utilize, utilize the,
storage that they needed at the beginning.

23
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,440
So and then increase as
their business grows.

24
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:51,360
So platform as a service, cloud offers
pre configured environment, environments

25
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,670
and tools that, dramatically reduce.

26
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,780
Deployment time, enabling
teams to focus on innovation.

27
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:06,850
So here, it, there would be a pre
configured or pre, pre developed tools

28
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,100
so enterprises can use those tools and
then, they are ready made available.

29
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,625
readily available and, they can
use the software, so instantly.

30
00:02:18,445 --> 00:02:22,645
They don't need to invest, time,
buying new softwares or, or to

31
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:24,095
cover their business requirements.

32
00:02:24,595 --> 00:02:25,785
Cloud service models.

33
00:02:26,685 --> 00:02:30,345
Cloud, computing offers three
service models that provide different

34
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,565
levels of control and functionality.

35
00:02:33,065 --> 00:02:39,975
So infrastructure as a service,
IAAS, called IAAS, provides on demand

36
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:45,635
computing resources, including, servers,
storage, and networking, offering

37
00:02:45,655 --> 00:02:47,645
maximum control over IT infrastructure.

38
00:02:48,145 --> 00:02:53,735
So in this way, so the companies need
not invest on their infrastructure in the

39
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:56,325
beginning, second, platform as a service.

40
00:02:56,825 --> 00:03:01,215
The cloud offers, cloud technologies
offers a complete cloud based development.

41
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:06,695
environment, removing infrastructure
management overhead to speed up

42
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:09,155
application development and deployment.

43
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:14,555
Third, a software as a service
delivers ready to use applications

44
00:03:14,725 --> 00:03:20,635
via internet, eliminating installation
and maintenance while providing

45
00:03:20,655 --> 00:03:22,075
immediate access to software.

46
00:03:22,965 --> 00:03:29,334
So software will be, readily available,
so you don't need to, invest on,

47
00:03:30,164 --> 00:03:34,394
softwares, So Infrastructure as a
Service, Scalable Infrastructure.

48
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:39,544
So, Infrastructure as a Service,
delivers virtualized computing resources.

49
00:03:40,414 --> 00:03:46,164
Through internet, giving enterprises
full infrastructure control without

50
00:03:46,814 --> 00:03:49,224
hardware management or head.

51
00:03:49,404 --> 00:03:53,824
So hardware will be managed by
the cloud systems cloud, companies

52
00:03:54,274 --> 00:03:59,759
so that, uh, clients or business
owners, they don't need to, spend

53
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,879
money on that platform like, aws.

54
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:02,799
Easy.

55
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,079
Two google cloud com.

56
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:09,289
Google Cloud, compute engine
provide a secure global distributed

57
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:14,269
computing power that enables high
performance analytics while maintaining

58
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:16,189
enterprise security standards.

59
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:22,159
Scalable, when it comes to scalability,
instantly just computing resources

60
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:24,454
to match workload, demand of.

61
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:30,084
business or company that needs
more resources on demand so they

62
00:04:30,084 --> 00:04:32,244
can increase their, resources.

63
00:04:32,344 --> 00:04:37,675
so, for a specific period, and then they
can, decrease, their resources so that,

64
00:04:37,775 --> 00:04:42,935
they, they have the flexibility, of, using
more resources when needed and, Reduce

65
00:04:42,975 --> 00:04:48,575
the resource size when it is not needed
so that they can optimize some of the

66
00:04:48,605 --> 00:04:54,715
cost, our resources and when it comes to
flexibility, custom configured operating

67
00:04:54,715 --> 00:05:01,685
systems, security and performance
settings so we can always configure,

68
00:05:01,785 --> 00:05:06,835
security components and performance
settings as per the business needs.

69
00:05:07,335 --> 00:05:12,105
So it has, got more flexibility
so you can implement, on demand

70
00:05:12,115 --> 00:05:15,925
security, additional security
features, and performance settings.

71
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:21,955
So cost effectiveness when it comes
to, pay only for those resources used

72
00:05:22,215 --> 00:05:24,225
while eliminating the capital expenses.

73
00:05:24,495 --> 00:05:30,215
So, organizations and enterprises,
they don't need to invest.

74
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:36,720
more in the beginning, so they can
only pay, for the services they, use,

75
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:42,760
not that, entire, services that comes
as a package, platform as a service,

76
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:49,290
so it offers accelerate development,
so development and deployment,

77
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,610
platform as a service, platforms
accelerate application development.

78
00:05:54,370 --> 00:06:00,500
example include Microsoft Azure App
Services, AWS Elastic, being tack,

79
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,820
reduce time to, insight, by up to 40%.

80
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,180
So rapid deployment, quickly
deploy and manage applications.

81
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,481
So deployment time would be.

82
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,090
So shortened.

83
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:20,730
so it's, it's very, it takes less
time to deploy automation, automate

84
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,800
the data pipeline task so you can
automate the processes so that, so

85
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,060
you can, you can schedule, To run them
on a specific, time where whenever

86
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:36,890
the more resources are available or
based on the, availability time, which

87
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:41,140
suits your business, collaboration,
enhanced team collaboration.

88
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:46,520
So, you can collaborate, With our
different teams, which works, which

89
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,720
availability will be 24 by seven.

90
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:54,320
So, you can collaborate, with multiple
teams working from different time zones.

91
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,490
Software as a service,
real time analytics.

92
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,530
SAS applications, empower
business with real time analytics.

93
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:06,190
Salesforce and Google
Analytics are popular options.

94
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,970
Improves operational efficiency
by 30 percent or more.

95
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,560
Data visualization.

96
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,750
Visualize data for better insights.

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:26,230
so it comes, with a pre configured or
pre analytical tools, or pre configured

98
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:32,195
analytical tools, which Gives, more, most
of the business analytics, capabilities,

99
00:07:32,295 --> 00:07:34,355
on demand and in a ready mode.

100
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:37,095
ready made, ready made, package.

101
00:07:37,945 --> 00:07:44,975
So, you can, use, those, pre configured
or pre, pre configured, tools and, you

102
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:47,205
can visualize the data, on our demand.

103
00:07:47,705 --> 00:07:48,965
AI driven insights.

104
00:07:49,105 --> 00:07:51,585
Leverage AI for, smarter decisions.

105
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:54,550
it also comes with the
AI, algorithms, tools.

106
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:01,400
which, gives much more, insight, of the
data so that the users can understand.

107
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,770
They can do calculations, they
can do some predictive analytics.

108
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:12,730
So, they can, businesses or users
can, understand, the data in a much

109
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,070
more simpler and, effective way.

110
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,980
Operational efficiency,
streamlined business process.

111
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,170
operational efficiency is more,
as, these are proven technologies

112
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,960
or proven tools and, stream,
streamlined business processes.

113
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,140
Cloud Analytic, use cases.

114
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:36,035
Cloud based analytics is
revolutionizing how enterprises

115
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:37,815
extract value from their data.

116
00:08:38,605 --> 00:08:43,415
Organizations leverage advanced
analytics to drive strategic decision

117
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:45,925
making and operational excellence.

118
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:51,215
Here are three transformative
applications that demonstrate

119
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:52,835
the power of cloud analytics.

120
00:08:53,335 --> 00:08:55,565
First one is predictive modeling.

121
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:01,880
So leverage machine learning to
forecast market trends, demand

122
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:07,500
patterns and business outcomes
with unprecedented accuracy.

123
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,630
So second one is a fraud detection.

124
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:17,590
Use real time pattern recognizing to
protect against financial fraud and

125
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,230
security threats across digital channels.

126
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,450
Third, third example is custom customers.

127
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,810
Segmentation.

128
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:30,990
Analyze behavioral data to create
precise customer segments for

129
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:37,930
personalized, marketing campaigns
and improved, conversion rates.

130
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,870
Forecoming, cloud challenges.

131
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:46,280
So obviously there would be challenges
when shifting from traditional,

132
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:52,240
traditional, onshore or traditional,
infrastructure to cloud infrastructure.

133
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:59,080
As organizations migrate to cloud,
they face critical challenges that must

134
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,430
be strategically addressed to ensure
successful digital transformation.

135
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:10,130
Understanding and proactively
managing these challenges is essential

136
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,850
for maximizing cloud benefits.

137
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,390
Security.

138
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:21,970
Protecting sensitive data from cyber
threats and unauthorized access.

139
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:26,400
While maintaining business
continuity and customer trust.

140
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:32,790
Second is a compliance meeting complex
regularity requirements across different,

141
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:41,140
jurisdictions while insurance data
sovereignty and privacy standards.

142
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:49,020
Cost optimizing cloud Spending through
proper resources allocation, preventing

143
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:56,050
unexpected expenses and maintaining
budget control, which is most important.

144
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:02,510
If you don't plan these, resources,
I had you may end up spending

145
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,450
more budget on the cloud services.

146
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:11,280
So this is a critical challenge that
many of the organizations will face.

147
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,210
But it can be optimized.

148
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,870
It can be controlled with
much planned with a good plan.

149
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,730
Successfully navigating
these challenges requires.

150
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:28,500
A comprehensive strategy that balance
security measures, regularity compliance

151
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,780
and cost optimization efforts.

152
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,480
Organizations must develop
robust frameworks and policies

153
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,220
to address each, aspects while
maintaining operational efficiency.

154
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,670
Strategies for, cloud governance.

155
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,260
effective cloud governance
requires a comprehensive

156
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,965
framework that ensures security,
compliance and cost optimization.

157
00:11:52,665 --> 00:11:58,345
and optional, optimal resource
utilization across your

158
00:11:58,405 --> 00:12:00,235
organization's cloud infrastructure.

159
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:07,695
Success depends on implementing well
defined protocols, establishing clear

160
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:16,785
accountability structures, and maintaining
vigilant oversight of cloud operations.

161
00:12:17,525 --> 00:12:23,155
Organizations must balance Agility
with control by creating scalable

162
00:12:23,795 --> 00:12:29,735
governance mechanisms that adapt
to evolving business needs while

163
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:32,595
maintaining strictly security standards.

164
00:12:33,095 --> 00:12:34,985
Maximize cost and
performance optimizations.

165
00:12:35,305 --> 00:12:39,995
Maximize return on investment
through resource optimization.

166
00:12:40,495 --> 00:12:43,125
Continuous monitoring and compliance.

167
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:48,375
Track usage patterns and
ensure regularity alignment.

168
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:52,085
Foundation policies and standards.

169
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:54,865
Establish a core governance framework.

170
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:59,735
The future is cloud based, so most
of the companies are enterprises.

171
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:05,885
They're shifting, towards the cloud
