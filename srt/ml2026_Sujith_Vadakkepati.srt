1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:01,320
Speaker 34: Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,250
Thanks for being here.

3
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:03,810
My name is Sujit ti.

4
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,440
I'm a product manager at Oracle where I
work on supply qualification compliance,

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,790
and supplier risk intelligence.

6
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,110
Over the last few years, I found
myself focusing on one big shift.

7
00:00:12,649 --> 00:00:14,780
Supplier risk isn't predictable anymore.

8
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,680
It doesn't wait for review cycles,
and it usually doesn't show up

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,854
first inside enterprise systems.

10
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:24,764
It starts outside like pandemics,
geopolitical tensions or sanctions,

11
00:00:25,154 --> 00:00:27,979
and only later do those signals
make their way into API data.

12
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:31,389
This creates a fundamental
mismatch between how risk actually

13
00:00:31,389 --> 00:00:34,869
emerges and how most enterprise
systems are designed to detect it.

14
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,129
So today's session is not about
experimenting with generative

15
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:40,139
AI or showcasing a chatbot.

16
00:00:40,889 --> 00:00:44,459
What I want to talk about is how
AI can really be put to work within

17
00:00:44,459 --> 00:00:45,749
the constraints of the organization.

18
00:00:46,249 --> 00:00:48,230
What I'll present is a
pattern, not a product.

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,719
Specifically an explainable hybrid rag
LLM framework that shows how retrieval

20
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,859
reasoning and governance can be combined
to produce supply risk intelligence.

21
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:01,749
To understand why a new approach
is needed, we first need to look at

22
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:03,429
how supply risk is typically assist.

23
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:03,699
Today.

24
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,419
Most organizations still rely
on traditional risk models

25
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:10,359
built around scorecards,
thresholds, or periodic reviews.

26
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,190
These systems operate on structured
data pulled from ERP platforms.

27
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:19,209
Something like financial metrics,
delivery, performance, or audit results,

28
00:01:19,389 --> 00:01:23,259
and they evaluate supplies in a fixed
cadence often, quarterly or annually.

29
00:01:24,249 --> 00:01:26,709
From the systems perspective,
these models are designed for

30
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:30,369
environments that are relatively
slow moving, stable and predictable.

31
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,009
The problem is that modern suppliers
does not behave that way quarterly.

32
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,489
Our annual reviews are fundamentally
misaligned with how risk actually emerges.

33
00:01:39,404 --> 00:01:41,324
Risk doesn't wait for review cycles.

34
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:45,225
It evolves continuously and is often
triggered by external events that

35
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:47,085
occur between reporting windows.

36
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:51,514
By the time a scheduled assessment
runs, the conditions that created the

37
00:01:51,514 --> 00:01:54,934
risk may already have escalated into
an operational or compliance issue.

38
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:58,914
Another important limitation is
that ERP data is lagging by design.

39
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:02,065
Enterprise systems are
excellent system of record.

40
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,375
They capture what has already happened.

41
00:02:04,945 --> 00:02:07,525
But they're not designed to capture
what is starting to happen in

42
00:02:07,525 --> 00:02:09,055
the world outside the system.

43
00:02:09,555 --> 00:02:14,085
Regulatory scrutiny, legal action,
geopolitical tensions, labor disputes, or

44
00:02:14,085 --> 00:02:18,915
ESG violations almost always surface first
in the external unstructured sources.

45
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,230
This creates a dangerous blind spot.

46
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,030
You can have supplies that appear
green across all internal metrics, like

47
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,410
on-time delivery, clean audits, stable
financials, while at the same time the

48
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,130
supplier is under regulatory investigation
or facing enforcement action.

49
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,130
That has not yet translated
into ERP visible signal.

50
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,320
From the systems point, nothing is
wrong in reality, risk is already

51
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,700
forming, and this leads to the core
insight that the system of record

52
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,320
is never where risk first appears.

53
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:51,145
Traditional risk models assume
that structure internal data is

54
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:55,045
the earliest and most reliable
signal in modern supply chains.

55
00:02:55,165 --> 00:03:00,565
That assumption no longer holds risk now
happens outside unpredictably, and often

56
00:03:00,565 --> 00:03:02,245
before rule-based systems can catch it.

57
00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:06,765
This mismatch between how risk forms
and how systems detected is the

58
00:03:06,765 --> 00:03:10,395
fundamental limitation that the rest of
this framework is designed to address.

59
00:03:10,895 --> 00:03:13,295
Alright, this slide gets to
the heart of the problem.

60
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:17,315
Why traditional supply risk
intelligence falls short, and it

61
00:03:17,315 --> 00:03:18,965
comes down to three key things.

62
00:03:19,655 --> 00:03:20,855
The first is static logic.

63
00:03:21,575 --> 00:03:25,205
Most traditional risk systems rely
on rule-based logic, basically

64
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:29,195
predefined conditions that assume we
already know what risk looks like.

65
00:03:29,735 --> 00:03:32,835
If a score drops, be below a
threshold, trigger an alert.

66
00:03:33,395 --> 00:03:35,765
If a certification expires, raise a flag.

67
00:03:36,605 --> 00:03:41,135
That works fine in stable in moments,
but supplier risk today isn't stable.

68
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,720
New risks keep emerging
from regulatory changes.

69
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,350
ESG pressures or market dynamics
that didn't even exist when

70
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,400
these rules were created.

71
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,470
Static rules just can't keep up
with the constant manual updates,

72
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,860
and by the time you update them,
the landscape has already shifted.

73
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,130
Again.

74
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,010
The second gap is limited sources.

75
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,510
Most additional risk systems lean
heavily on internal structured data like

76
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,320
supplier questionnaires, ERP records
audits, or past performance metrics.

77
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,770
That data is solid, but
it's not the full story.

78
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,600
Early warning signs usually surface
outside first in unstructured sources

79
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,880
long before they show up in your systems.

80
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,330
If your risk engine only looks
at structured data, it misses

81
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,890
where the risk actually starts.

82
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,560
The third problem is delayed detection.

83
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,850
Because the system depends on
threshold and scheduled evaluations,

84
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,950
they tend to catch risk only once.

85
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,030
It's already significant.

86
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,755
The risk rarely shows up all at once.

87
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:39,175
It creeps in through
weak signals over time.

88
00:04:39,675 --> 00:04:42,465
By the time an alert fires
you are usually reacting and

89
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:44,835
not preventing taken together.

90
00:04:44,955 --> 00:04:46,875
These three issues reinforce each other.

91
00:04:47,385 --> 00:04:49,185
Static logic prevents adoption.

92
00:04:49,575 --> 00:04:53,565
Limited sources hide early signals
and threshold base detection

93
00:04:53,565 --> 00:04:55,290
ensures risk is discovered too late.

94
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:00,115
This is why traditional risk systems
consistently fail to detect risk

95
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,915
on time in dynamic supply chains.

96
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,950
So it's not that the traditional
systems fade, they're just, they're

97
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,900
just built for a world that's changed.

98
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,200
But today, closing this gap
requires a new way to gather,

99
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,790
understand, and explain the signals.

100
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,350
This slide introduces the solution
to the gap we just discussed.

101
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,210
The core idea here is an explainable
hybrid framework that combines

102
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,030
retrieval, augmented generation
with large language models to

103
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,500
produce supplier risk intelligence.

104
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,685
That's adaptive
evidence-based and enterprise.

105
00:05:28,185 --> 00:05:31,305
What's important is that it's not
a single model doing everything.

106
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:36,495
It's a pipeline with clearly separated
responsibilities, which is why it works

107
00:05:36,495 --> 00:05:38,205
in regulated high stakes environment.

108
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,195
At the top, you see the rag level system.

109
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:43,265
Think of this as a grounding layer.

110
00:05:44,255 --> 00:05:48,575
Before the system starts reasoning it
first gathers solid evidence from internal

111
00:05:48,575 --> 00:05:50,645
systems and external intelligence sources.

112
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,080
Things like performance history,
compliance data, regulatory

113
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,210
actions, news or ESG disclosures.

114
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,240
That RIE step sets the gut rails.

115
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,840
It defines what the system actually
knows when it makes an assessment.

116
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,170
Below that is the LLM reasoning layer.

117
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,960
So the LLM isn't here to speculate, it's
here to reason it looks at the evidence.

118
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,500
We retrieved connect signals
across different domains and

119
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,620
helps explain why your supplier's
risk profile could be shifting.

120
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,175
And the key point is.

121
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,760
It stays anchored to that evidence.

122
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,090
If the data isn't there, it
doesn't invent an answer.

123
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,680
The output of that reasoning step is
what you see in the third step, which

124
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,390
is the transplant risk narratives.

125
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,190
So instead of a single score or a
vague alert, you get a risk narrative.

126
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:41,830
It explains what evidence was used,
how the signals came together, and

127
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,390
where there is still uncertainty.

128
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:47,820
That makes it genuinely usable, not just
something that you read, but something

129
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,350
you can evaluate and stand behind.

130
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,780
And this is where governance comes in.

131
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,280
The goal here is to combine strong
retrieval and smart generative reasoning.

132
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,590
And governance isn't an afterthought.

133
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,280
It's big deal.

134
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,370
You can trace every
conclusion to evidence.

135
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,330
You can review our overall decisions,
and there's always an audit trail

136
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,345
behind what the system does.

137
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:10,725
If there's one thing to take away
from this slide, it is we are

138
00:07:10,725 --> 00:07:14,595
not replacing systems and people,
we are organizing intelligence.

139
00:07:14,595 --> 00:07:19,635
So risk detection becomes more adaptive,
explainable, and scalable, and that's

140
00:07:19,635 --> 00:07:23,265
what actually makes AI usable in real
procurement and compliance workflows.

141
00:07:23,765 --> 00:07:27,635
This slide zooms in on the data
integration layer because everything

142
00:07:27,635 --> 00:07:30,845
downstream, like retrieval,
reasoning, explainability, depends

143
00:07:30,845 --> 00:07:31,745
on getting this part right.

144
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:35,695
At the foundation of this architecture,
we bring structured ERP data

145
00:07:35,905 --> 00:07:37,405
together with external intelligence.

146
00:07:37,675 --> 00:07:41,425
Instead of treating them as separate
or competing inputs, the framework

147
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:44,305
is designed to combine both of them
into a single reasoning pipeline.

148
00:07:44,805 --> 00:07:48,435
On the internal side, ERP data
gives us stability and context.

149
00:07:49,005 --> 00:07:53,265
It tells us which suppliers matter how
they're performed historically, and where

150
00:07:53,445 --> 00:07:55,155
the enterprise already has exposure.

151
00:07:55,785 --> 00:07:57,645
It's governed, trusted, and essential.

152
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,910
But it's also inherently backward looking.

153
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,510
That's why the external intelligence
layer is just as important.

154
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:08,910
We start with geopolitical risk indicators
like regional instability, sanctions,

155
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:13,770
trade restrictions or policy shifts,
factors that can disrupt supply even when

156
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,510
a supplier appears operationally healthy.

157
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,630
Then financial stability signals.

158
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:21,935
Not just internal payment history,
but early indicators like credit,

159
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:26,135
stress, liquidity concerns, market
commentary or rating changes

160
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:27,545
that often show up externally.

161
00:08:27,545 --> 00:08:31,585
First, you also integrate regulatory
compliance signals like enforcement

162
00:08:31,585 --> 00:08:34,975
actions, warning letters,
litigations, or regulatory filings.

163
00:08:35,475 --> 00:08:37,080
And finally, ESG performance data.

164
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,550
Environmental, social and
governance signals are increasingly

165
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:44,300
leading indicators for regulatory
pressure, reputational impact, and

166
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,070
long-term SU supplier viability.

167
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,950
Treating ESG as a primary input,
not an afterthought, is critical

168
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,660
for forward-looking intelligence.

169
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,020
Now this, just as in data aggregation,
these sources are normalized, enriched

170
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,700
with metadata like recency and source
credibility and structured so that the

171
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,100
retrieval layer can reason across domains.

172
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:09,855
The system can waste signals in context
instead of reacting to them in isolation.

173
00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:14,025
The result is broader risk, visibility
beyond traditional boundaries.

174
00:09:14,865 --> 00:09:18,315
Instead of just asking what do we
know internally about the supplier,

175
00:09:18,615 --> 00:09:22,185
the system can ask what changes
are happening around the supplier

176
00:09:22,185 --> 00:09:23,415
right now, and why does it matter?

177
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:27,605
And disintegrated view is what
enables early detection, crossin

178
00:09:27,605 --> 00:09:30,650
reasoning, and explainable risk
in insights at enterprise scale.

179
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:34,780
This slide is really about why
relatable augmented generation improves

180
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,700
detection and not just how it works.

181
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,590
Traditionally, AI models usually
rely on what they learn during

182
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,730
training that works in stable
areas, but supply risk isn't stable.

183
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:49,920
Things seen all the time, new regulations,
geopolitical shifts, financial issues

184
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,170
often after the model has been trained.

185
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,305
So instead of asking the model to guess.

186
00:09:55,085 --> 00:09:58,535
This approach starts by retrieving current
information from different sources.

187
00:09:58,835 --> 00:10:02,495
It pulls in what's actually
happening right now and uses that

188
00:10:02,495 --> 00:10:04,115
as the foundation for analysis.

189
00:10:04,985 --> 00:10:08,675
The model then looks at that evidence,
connects signals across sources,

190
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:11,705
and explains what might be changing
in a supplier's risk profile.

191
00:10:12,515 --> 00:10:17,495
And importantly, those explanations
include traceable sources so people can

192
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:19,160
see where the conclusions are coming from.

193
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,720
That's what makes this usable
in real enterprise settings.

194
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,300
Instead of a mysterious score or an
alert, you get an explanation what

195
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:30,380
evidence was used, how signals current,
and why the risk level changed.

196
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:35,000
So the key takeaway is every risk
assessment is grounded in real

197
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,920
evidence, not just model prediction.

198
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,880
And that shift from guessing to
evidence-based reasoning is what helps

199
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,560
organizations detect risk earlier, build
trusting AI and actually use it in real

200
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,210
procurement and compliance workflows.

201
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:52,240
So far, I've talked about why this
architecture matters and how it works.

202
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:56,320
The obvious next question is, does it
actually perform in the real world?

203
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,850
This slide shows the results from
evaluations across manufacturing

204
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,600
and technology networks comparing
traditional rule-based systems

205
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,640
with hybrid ose, LLM approach.

206
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,770
Let's start with detection position.

207
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,215
The top meter.

208
00:11:08,715 --> 00:11:12,225
When risk shows up in new ways,
the hybrid approach does better

209
00:11:12,225 --> 00:11:15,255
because it reasons over the current
evidence instead of fixed rules.

210
00:11:15,915 --> 00:11:19,455
This helps catch a real risk
earlier while reducing false alarms.

211
00:11:20,235 --> 00:11:21,255
Next is response time.

212
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:25,905
Traditional systems often depend
heavily on manual analysis, people

213
00:11:25,905 --> 00:11:28,665
searching for documents, connecting
signals, and interpreting data

214
00:11:28,665 --> 00:11:30,880
across systems with a hybrid model.

215
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:34,365
Retrieval is automated and evidence
is presented in the synthesized.

216
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,370
That speeds up assessment significantly
without sacrificing quality.

217
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,850
The third metric is risk coverage.

218
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,650
Rule-based systems usually cover only what
they were explicitly designed to monitor.

219
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,160
If a risk doesn't fit neatly
into a pre-defined category,

220
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,390
it often gets missed.

221
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,380
The hybrid approach gives a
much broader view of the risk.

222
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,710
Importantly, these improvements
aren't coming from cutting corners.

223
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,030
Faster response comes from better
retrieval and automation, not

224
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,230
from simplifying the analysis.

225
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:07,460
Every conclusion is still
evidence-based and explainable, which

226
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,140
is critical for enterprise trust.

227
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,000
So the key takeaway is it's not just
faster or more accurate in isolation.

228
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,480
Retrieval, augmentation, reasoning
changes how risk systems perform

229
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:22,250
overall higher position, quicker
response to emerging threats and

230
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,840
broader visibility at the same time.

231
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,750
And that's what helps supplier
risk management shift from

232
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,750
reactive monitoring to proactive
continuous intelligence at scale.

233
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,579
This slide shows how the framework detects
risk, the way it actually happens in

234
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:38,589
the real world, not as isolated events,
but as signals across different areas.

235
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:42,250
And the key point is none of those
signals are looked at in isolation.

236
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,800
Let's start with the financial distress.

237
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,814
Traditionally, systems usually catch
financial risk after payments are missed.

238
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,215
Credit ratings drop or
financial ratios weaker.

239
00:12:51,995 --> 00:12:55,560
This framework looks earlier, things
like negative market commentary.

240
00:12:55,864 --> 00:13:00,574
Subtle financial pressure or shifts
in credits, outlooks individually.

241
00:13:00,574 --> 00:13:03,694
This may seem minor, but together
they can signal that as supply, as

242
00:13:03,694 --> 00:13:05,224
financial health is starting to weaken.

243
00:13:05,724 --> 00:13:07,134
Next is compliance exposure.

244
00:13:07,734 --> 00:13:10,254
Compliance risk rarely shows
up as a single violation.

245
00:13:10,704 --> 00:13:14,094
It usually starts with increased
scrutiny, investigations,

246
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:15,894
warning letters, policy changes.

247
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:20,149
By tracking these signals at cross
regulators and regions, the system can

248
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:23,759
surface compliance risk before it turns
into an enforcement action or weapon.

249
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:28,199
Uh, that early visibility can
make a big difference, especially

250
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:29,369
in regulated industries.

251
00:13:29,869 --> 00:13:31,819
The third area is ESG risk.

252
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:36,229
Environmental issues, labor concerns,
governance problems are often

253
00:13:36,229 --> 00:13:40,639
treated as secondary risks, but in
reality they often signal future

254
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,849
regulatory action, reputational
damage, or operational deception.

255
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:49,099
So this framework treats ESG signals
as core inputs, not afterthoughts.

256
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:51,294
What makes this approach different?

257
00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:55,699
Isn't just detecting these signals
individually, it's connecting them

258
00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:00,459
A small financial concern combined
with a compliance scrutiny and ESG

259
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:04,419
signals can indicate a supplier heading
towards trouble, even if no single

260
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:06,249
metric has crossed the threshold yet.

261
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:11,889
The hybrid approach can identify
multifactor risk earlier, giving teams

262
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:16,749
time to act, engage with suppliers at
just sourcing or increase monitoring

263
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:18,129
before the problems escalate.

264
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:20,589
So the main takeaway is simple.

265
00:14:21,414 --> 00:14:23,514
Risk rarely shows up as one big event.

266
00:14:24,084 --> 00:14:26,304
It builds quietly across multiple signals.

267
00:14:26,804 --> 00:14:29,654
This slide highlights something
that's critical for using AI in

268
00:14:29,654 --> 00:14:31,184
enterprise and regulatory moments.

269
00:14:31,574 --> 00:14:32,024
Auditability.

270
00:14:32,524 --> 00:14:35,284
In simple terms, it means
we can trace exactly how a

271
00:14:35,284 --> 00:14:36,664
risk assessment was produced.

272
00:14:37,384 --> 00:14:40,384
The important idea is that
every step leaves a record.

273
00:14:40,984 --> 00:14:42,334
Nothing is hidden or temporary.

274
00:14:43,084 --> 00:14:43,894
First is retrieval.

275
00:14:44,524 --> 00:14:46,189
The system records which
documents were pulled.

276
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:49,564
Where they came from, when
they were retrieved and why.

277
00:14:50,064 --> 00:14:53,995
Next is extraction relevant facts
and signals are pulled from those

278
00:14:53,995 --> 00:14:57,805
documents, and each one can be
traced back to its original source.

279
00:14:58,645 --> 00:14:59,725
Then comes synthesis.

280
00:15:00,295 --> 00:15:03,985
The model connects signals across
areas like financial, regulatory,

281
00:15:03,985 --> 00:15:07,555
geopolitical, and SGS to create
a structured risk narrative.

282
00:15:08,055 --> 00:15:08,985
Finally, this review.

283
00:15:09,555 --> 00:15:11,625
Humans don't just see a
final score or answer.

284
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:16,364
They can see the evidence, the
reasoning part, and the context, and

285
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:19,964
any human decisions like approvals,
overrides, and escalations also

286
00:15:19,964 --> 00:15:20,954
become part of the audit trail.

287
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,524
This matters for
regulations and governance.

288
00:15:24,094 --> 00:15:26,944
Provenance tracking gives a
complete change from source

289
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:28,714
documents to final risk conclusion.

290
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,314
That means you can explain not
just what decision was made,

291
00:15:32,524 --> 00:15:35,464
but why it was made based on the
information available at that time.

292
00:15:35,964 --> 00:15:39,084
This level of transparency is
essential for compliance audits

293
00:15:39,294 --> 00:15:40,614
and post-incident reviews.

294
00:15:41,185 --> 00:15:45,444
It helps organizations show due
diligence, justify decisions, and maintain

295
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,484
accountability when AI is involved.

296
00:15:48,384 --> 00:15:52,284
So the key takeaway here is
auditability isn't an add-on here.

297
00:15:52,555 --> 00:15:55,244
It's built into the
architecture at this point.

298
00:15:55,574 --> 00:15:59,354
There's a question that always comes
up when AI enters risk and compliance.

299
00:16:00,344 --> 00:16:01,364
How do we control it?

300
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,130
In this framework, governance
isn't something added later.

301
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,230
It's built into the design from the start.

302
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,410
This slide highlights three core controls.

303
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,030
That's part of the architecture itself.

304
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,219
First is bias mitigation.

305
00:16:14,729 --> 00:16:19,140
Supplier risk decisions can affect
finances, operations, and reputations.

306
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:23,824
So bias isn't just theoretical,
it has a real impact here.

307
00:16:23,965 --> 00:16:29,340
Biases monitored across the entire process
in the data retrieved in how signals are

308
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,290
weighted and in the outputs produced.

309
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,080
Second is interpretability.

310
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,340
The system doesn't produce
mysterious course or alerts.

311
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:40,420
Every assessment includes a clear
explanation showing what evidence was

312
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,640
used, how the conclusions was reached.

313
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:47,410
This helps procurement teams, analyst
auditors, and leaders understand not just

314
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,850
the result but the reasoning behind it.

315
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,580
Third is human oversight.

316
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,510
This isn't an autonomous
decision maker, it's a decision.

317
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,070
Support important.

318
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,945
Assessments go through
structured human review.

319
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,390
Experts can review the evidence question,
the reasoning, override recommendations

320
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,460
if needed, and record their decisions.

321
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:10,440
Thus, actions become part of the auditing,
and these three controls work together.

322
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,590
Bias can be checked because
reasoning is transparent.

323
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:18,540
So the key takeaway is simple
governance isn't an add-on here.

324
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,140
It's built into the architecture,
and that's what makes it possible

325
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:25,200
to use advanced air responsibly
in high stake suppliers decision.

326
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,320
This slide addresses a question.

327
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,660
Engineers often ask, doesn't all
this slow things down in this

328
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,220
framework actually does the opposite?

329
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,640
The biggest performance gain
comes from automated review.

330
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,615
The system continuously pulls in and
indexes both internal enterprise data

331
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,580
and external intelligence sources.

332
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:47,380
So when something new happens, a
regulatory filing or an enforcement

333
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,320
action, or even news about a
supplier, the system can ev

334
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,095
evaluate it almost immediately.

335
00:17:52,595 --> 00:17:54,275
That's what reduces latency.

336
00:17:54,845 --> 00:17:56,645
We are not simplifying the analysis.

337
00:17:56,795 --> 00:17:58,655
We are removing manual bottlenecks.

338
00:17:59,405 --> 00:18:00,785
Retrieval happens in parallel.

339
00:18:01,295 --> 00:18:05,375
Reasoning stays focused on the relevant
evidence that helps maintain accuracy

340
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,635
while speeding up the response time.

341
00:18:07,135 --> 00:18:09,085
Another key piece is
continuous monitoring.

342
00:18:09,835 --> 00:18:12,775
This framework runs like a live
pipeline as new evidence appear.

343
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,960
Risk assessment update.

344
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:19,920
That means decisions are based on what's
happening now, not what was two weeks ago.

345
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,660
From scalability perspective,
this approach also works

346
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,250
across large supply networks.

347
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:30,140
Because data retrival and reasoning are
automated and separated, the system can

348
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,190
scale without needing a proportional
increase in human effort, people focus

349
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,660
on decisions, not data gathering.

350
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,700
So the main takeaway is speed and
accuracy don't have to compete.

351
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,840
It enables rigor and scale, which is
exactly what modern supply chains need.

352
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,790
So far, we are talking about
the architecture, retrieval,

353
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,020
reasoning, and governance.

354
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:53,820
This slide shows what those design
choices actually deliver in practice.

355
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,530
First, better precision because the
system reasons over real evidence.

356
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,530
Instead of fixed thresholds,
it's better at separating real

357
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,760
risk from background noise.

358
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,280
Second is the faster response.

359
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,180
Continuous monitoring and automated
retrieval means emerging risk

360
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,145
can be spotted much earlier.

361
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:13,790
Instead of finding problems during your
next review cycle, teams can engage

362
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:17,630
suppliers, access sourcing, or increase
monitoring before the issues escalate.

363
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,510
Third is broader coverage.

364
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,390
Traditional systems usually
focus on specific risk

365
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,770
categories they're built for.

366
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:28,240
This framework expands that view by
combining geopolitical, financial,

367
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,720
regulatory, and ESG signals into
one single reasoning pipeline.

368
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,990
Next is regulatory compliance.

369
00:19:34,785 --> 00:19:37,905
Because every assessment is stack
traceable, evidence and captured

370
00:19:37,905 --> 00:19:39,105
through provenance tracking.

371
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:41,175
Outputs are auditable by default.

372
00:19:42,165 --> 00:19:43,155
Fifth is scalability.

373
00:19:43,905 --> 00:19:47,865
Automated ingestion, retrieval and
reasoning allows the system to work across

374
00:19:47,865 --> 00:19:51,555
thousands of suppliers without requiring
proportional increase in human effort.

375
00:19:52,215 --> 00:19:56,115
People focus on decisions and oversight
and not collecting and sorting data.

376
00:19:57,105 --> 00:19:58,815
And finally, explainable insights.

377
00:19:59,235 --> 00:20:03,075
Instead of black box course, the system
explains how evidence was interpreted

378
00:20:03,075 --> 00:20:05,375
and why conclusions were reached taken.

379
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,715
Together, they are in small improvements.

380
00:20:07,985 --> 00:20:11,615
They represents a shift in how
supplier risk is managed from

381
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:15,215
periodic rule-based monitoring to
continuous explainable intelligence

382
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,075
that operates at enterprise scale.

383
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:19,370
This slide really brings
everything together.

384
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:23,200
What we have been talking about today
isn't just one model or one technique.

385
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:27,580
It's a system level approach to managing
supplier risk in a world that's constantly

386
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:33,060
changing by combining accurate data, air
reasoning, and strong governance control.

387
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:36,600
This framework makes supplier risk
management more explainable and

388
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,030
responsible by design, the first pillar
is integrating diverse data sources.

389
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,555
This doesn't start inside
enterprise systems.

390
00:20:43,975 --> 00:20:45,115
It often starts outside.

391
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,280
By combining internal data and external
signal, the system gets earlier

392
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,470
visibility into emerging risks.

393
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,350
The second pillar is automated.

394
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,380
RIE automation keeps the system current.

395
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:58,860
Instead of waiting for manual
reviews or reporting cycles, new

396
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,630
information is pulled in continuously.

397
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,755
That helps organizations respond
to risk while it's still forming.

398
00:21:04,255 --> 00:21:06,415
The third pillar is explainable insights.

399
00:21:06,775 --> 00:21:08,185
Detecting risk isn't enough.

400
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,575
Team needs to understand
it and explainability turns

401
00:21:11,575 --> 00:21:13,195
into actionable intelligence.

402
00:21:14,155 --> 00:21:16,045
And the final pillar is human oversight.

403
00:21:16,705 --> 00:21:18,715
This isn't about replacing people.

404
00:21:19,075 --> 00:21:21,445
Humans remain accountable
for important decisions.

405
00:21:22,045 --> 00:21:24,895
Put together these four elements
define what resilience looks

406
00:21:24,895 --> 00:21:26,245
like in modern supply chains.

407
00:21:26,575 --> 00:21:29,520
It's not just more
dashboards or faster alerts.

408
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,480
It's intelligence that adapts,
explains itself and earns trust.

409
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,840
And ultimately that's how AI
moves from experimentation into

410
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,260
something organizations can rely
on in real supply chain scenarios.

411
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,760
I will close by quickly summarizing
the main ideas I want you to

412
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,750
take away from this session.

413
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:50,250
First, hybrid drag, LLM frameworks
help overcome the limitations of

414
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,560
traditional rule-based risk systems.

415
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:58,145
Second, combining multiple data sources
is critical for early risk detection.

416
00:21:58,915 --> 00:21:59,265
Third.

417
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,460
Governance and provenance
tracking aren't optional.

418
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,190
And finally, the results matter.

419
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,680
This isn't just a theoretical framework.

420
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:12,270
Evaluations across a real supply chain
show improvement in detection, position

421
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,220
response time, and risk coverage.

422
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,810
So the broader takeaway is this, the
future of supplier risk management

423
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,030
isn't about smartest standalone models.

424
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,110
It's about building systems that
retrieve reason, explain and operate

425
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,270
under strong governance altogether.

426
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:32,060
And that's what ultimately allows AI to
move from experimentation into trusted

427
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,950
real world operational intelligence.

428
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,650
What I hope this session showed
is that applying AI to suppliers

429
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:43,000
isn't just about adding intelligence
on top of existing systems.

430
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,950
It's really about rethinking
how intelligence is produced.

431
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,535
The hybrid framework I shared
is not a silver bullet.

432
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,430
But it's a solid pattern for moving
beyond the static rules-based,

433
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,800
continuous and explainable intelligence.

434
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,280
Thank you all for your time and attention.
