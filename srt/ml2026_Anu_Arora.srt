1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,369
Speaker 6: Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,429 --> 00:00:03,290
Good morning, good
evening, good afternoon.

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,000
Hope all of you're doing good.

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,709
So my name is Annu Aurora and I'm here
to present today's topic, which is

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,879
Zero Surface Task, how we are applying
machine learning and automated workflows

6
00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:15,650
to achieve autonomous IT support.

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,649
My, I'm a director for
Enterprise Systems at ServiceNow.

8
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:22,949
My role basically revolves around
how better we can use our own

9
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:25,349
products internally to achieve.

10
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:27,239
Better operational efficiency.

11
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:30,659
Productivity and basically
be that customer zero.

12
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:35,340
So that we can be the first to try our
own products, give feedback, and that

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,989
really gives us an opportunity to have
a better product, which eventually gets

14
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:41,519
to the market for all of our customers.

15
00:00:41,569 --> 00:00:44,699
So let's talk about Zero
Service Desk and what were the

16
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:46,124
challenges for a traditional.

17
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,829
It and why we thought of moving
towards zero service desk, right?

18
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:54,929
So the first one, and the most important
one is reactive workflows, right?

19
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,459
We always wait for something
to happen before we take

20
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,079
action as an example, right?

21
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:05,879
Hey, some issue happened, this
particular server is down and let's

22
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,229
take some action now because it's down.

23
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,169
Is there a way I can identify
it beforehand that it was.

24
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:13,719
Something is going on so that even
that server doesn't get down the user

25
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:18,754
gets help and, that what incorporated
or that eventually evolved to

26
00:01:18,874 --> 00:01:20,854
incident volume increase as well.

27
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:26,764
So if, let's say, if I have reactive,
I'm waiting for people to ask for

28
00:01:26,764 --> 00:01:31,085
help, ask for questions, what they need
help with, then the volume of tickets

29
00:01:31,085 --> 00:01:32,884
will eventually increase over time.

30
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,294
Because every company's growing.

31
00:01:34,354 --> 00:01:37,594
We have more employees, rather what
we have five years back, right?

32
00:01:37,925 --> 00:01:43,684
So to serve the same number of employees
or same number of people, then I have to.

33
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:48,529
Think about maybe do I need to increase
my support staff more because now I have

34
00:01:48,529 --> 00:01:53,389
more people to help day to day and is the
only job is to work on tickets, right?

35
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:55,759
So that are some of the limitations.

36
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,529
If we work on and ask people for
help and doesn't provide a way to

37
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:04,939
them to self solve or self-help,
then this becomes a pattern.

38
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:07,849
And then, okay, incident, people
growing, employees growing

39
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:08,604
incident volume, growing.

40
00:02:09,354 --> 00:02:15,054
Now, okay, that's, we think maybe we need
more people to support the wider audience,

41
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:19,014
but that were some limitations, and that's
how we thought, okay, we need to scale.

42
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:23,369
If the employee base for our company
is increasing every year, doesn't

43
00:02:23,369 --> 00:02:26,189
mean that I have to have always
hired more support guys as well.

44
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:29,909
And that's where this idea originated
and that's where we started

45
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:32,069
moving towards Zero Service Desk.

46
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,479
Now, I know for some of them you
might have already heard it, but

47
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,949
for some of them it might be new.

48
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,889
What does Zero Service Desk really
means for us specifically at ServiceNow?

49
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:47,809
It means how best we leverage
our own platform, ServiceNow.

50
00:02:48,424 --> 00:02:51,724
And get help to the employees,
which is my user base, right?

51
00:02:52,144 --> 00:02:59,374
Faster, more proactively and within like
I would say, minutes or seconds rather

52
00:02:59,374 --> 00:03:01,264
than they waiting for hours to get help.

53
00:03:01,984 --> 00:03:06,094
It doesn't mean that we don't have
a service desk or there's no concept

54
00:03:06,094 --> 00:03:09,574
of service desk, but it basically
means rather than human agents, we

55
00:03:09,574 --> 00:03:14,434
do that support, help or provide
help to the employees or my users.

56
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:19,849
How I can best leverage ai, my own
service, net platform, own workflows,

57
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:24,409
orchestration, integration between
third parties, so that to provide help

58
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:28,429
to our employees or a user base, I
don't need any human agent in the loop.

59
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:33,949
So that is the whole idea about, and
it majorly focused on self-service,

60
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:37,579
how much we can enable our
employees to self-help themselves.

61
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:38,664
That was the idea.

62
00:03:39,164 --> 00:03:43,454
Now key machine learning features
that were part of the overall old

63
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,539
architecture or overall concept?

64
00:03:45,544 --> 00:03:48,824
Concept was the first one is
the classification, right?

65
00:03:49,214 --> 00:03:55,484
We need to categorize, be able to
efficiently help the employee, right?

66
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:56,744
What kind of issue it is?

67
00:03:56,744 --> 00:03:58,154
Has it happened in the past?

68
00:03:58,814 --> 00:04:00,314
Is it something new of a case?

69
00:04:00,314 --> 00:04:04,034
If it has already happened in the past,
can I apply same metrics and same data and

70
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:06,074
just help the user as an example, right?

71
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:10,694
Someone feel back, Hey, someone asked
for an HR policy which is related

72
00:04:10,694 --> 00:04:15,614
to holiday leave or maternity,
and this is user was helped with.

73
00:04:15,704 --> 00:04:18,885
Can I apply the same rules and try
to help the user in the same way?

74
00:04:19,244 --> 00:04:21,464
Then we don't need any
human in the loop, right?

75
00:04:22,214 --> 00:04:26,564
The other is obviously the important
is an intent, dis intent detection.

76
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:29,889
So if I'm coming for help, right?

77
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:33,609
Just based on how questions I
type, I'm taking help of let's

78
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:34,569
say, virtual agent, right?

79
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:38,319
What questions I'm typing, is it
something information readily available?

80
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,369
Can I help the user?

81
00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:42,454
Right now, the user is asking, Hey,
I need access to this particular.

82
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:46,560
Role, or I need access to this
particular environment, can I

83
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,880
provide that access right away?

84
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,909
So all these right pillars are important.

85
00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:53,820
And last but not the least,
is the anomaly detection.

86
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,840
This really helps us in
being predictive, right?

87
00:04:58,049 --> 00:05:03,179
Being proactive if, hey, on
my laptops especially, right?

88
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:09,030
I see for this particular user, I
see his CPU spike is happening every

89
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,640
day and maybe specific time duration.

90
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,930
I think as a system of records, I
should reach out to the end user

91
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,719
and let them know, Hey, something
is wrong, something is unusual.

92
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:23,539
Maybe it's time to do this, or upgrade
your system or restart your device.

93
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:28,779
Anything it can be right that avoids
the user to come to service desk,

94
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:30,614
or relevant agent will ask for help.

95
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,019
Hey, my laptop is down.

96
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:32,679
I don't know why.

97
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:37,199
If we detect the issue beforehand,
then we can reach out to the employee

98
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,909
and the user and help them beforehand.

99
00:05:39,554 --> 00:05:40,634
So think about it, right?

100
00:05:40,684 --> 00:05:43,954
It's how much being proactive
and how much being reactive.

101
00:05:44,404 --> 00:05:45,814
That's what has changed over time.

102
00:05:46,024 --> 00:05:49,604
We are not waiting for
users to provide me access.

103
00:05:49,604 --> 00:05:52,454
Hey, somebody will come and give me
access to this thing, and then I will

104
00:05:52,454 --> 00:05:54,074
start working or do my day-to-day job.

105
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:55,994
No, it's not the case anymore, right?

106
00:05:56,335 --> 00:06:01,104
How the services that you're
expecting, your L one or service test

107
00:06:01,104 --> 00:06:05,215
to provide, how we can automate it,
how we can better detect those issues

108
00:06:05,215 --> 00:06:10,174
and how we can better help is what's
the norm And it's still evolution.

109
00:06:10,174 --> 00:06:11,734
I think that the evolution
is the way right.

110
00:06:11,824 --> 00:06:15,724
Gen K is already there, so how we
incorporate gent KI is definitely

111
00:06:15,724 --> 00:06:19,085
important to everyone in it, whoever
is in IT technology these days.

112
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:23,554
Now what our approach has
been as an IT organization.

113
00:06:23,554 --> 00:06:28,145
And when we started thinking about
Zero Service Desk, how we started, what

114
00:06:28,145 --> 00:06:32,494
is our focus area, what we try to do
that now we are calling ourself as a

115
00:06:32,494 --> 00:06:34,114
zero service desk organization, right?

116
00:06:34,835 --> 00:06:40,354
And again, it trading Zero Service
Desk really means how we are using our

117
00:06:40,354 --> 00:06:43,025
own platform service now to provide.

118
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:48,745
The help or support that users
need from the support task or

119
00:06:48,745 --> 00:06:50,304
from the elephant support, right?

120
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:54,775
So if you see on the screen
there are four pillars.

121
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:56,484
Prevent, deflect, automate, augment.

122
00:06:56,755 --> 00:06:58,794
So let's talk through it one by one.

123
00:06:59,664 --> 00:07:01,494
The first one is the prevent, right?

124
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:05,094
Everyone wants to be in the
prevent phase for everything.

125
00:07:05,784 --> 00:07:08,034
Are we there in the prevent
phase for everything maybe?

126
00:07:08,034 --> 00:07:08,125
No.

127
00:07:08,175 --> 00:07:10,065
Some of the things we
today cannot prevent.

128
00:07:10,245 --> 00:07:13,365
But we still are monitoring, we still
have observability in place, right?

129
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:15,885
We are monitoring how our laptops
are performing, how we are laptop.

130
00:07:15,975 --> 00:07:20,495
We are monitoring how our infrastructure,
how our network devices, servers, right?

131
00:07:20,495 --> 00:07:21,784
How our applications are performing.

132
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,755
There are different pillars of
observability and monitoring, right?

133
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:28,925
We always want to be there so that
we don't have to maybe eventually do.

134
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,135
Others.

135
00:07:30,255 --> 00:07:33,555
But yes, we still have to do
others based on the use case,

136
00:07:33,555 --> 00:07:35,985
based on the environment criteria.

137
00:07:35,985 --> 00:07:37,005
What kind of help?

138
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,005
Now let's more dive into
deflect or automate.

139
00:07:40,215 --> 00:07:44,745
These two are the places where
we definitely want to be, even

140
00:07:44,745 --> 00:07:47,145
if we are not implementing it
at any organization, right?

141
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:50,950
So from an infra point or a hardware
point or an application point,

142
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,910
definitely observing and monitoring
will help prevent the issues.

143
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,530
Very sweet spot.

144
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,090
We don't want incidents to be
coming in, issues to be created.

145
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,260
Okay.

146
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,670
We identify, okay, I see there's a
something wrong with this laptop.

147
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,015
It needs an upgrade of a Zoom client.

148
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:10,859
Okay, let me reach out to the user,
let them know we will do this at

149
00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:12,420
this particular time if you're okay.

150
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:12,869
Yes.

151
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:15,149
Good preventive, nothing happened.

152
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:19,019
Now there are scenarios for
deflect and automate, right?

153
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,139
And let me explain that with an
example, because then it becomes more.

154
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:23,344
Meaningful.

155
00:08:24,275 --> 00:08:25,565
So let's talk about deflect.

156
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:30,705
Now I talked about this or give an
example before, but I come to ServiceNow

157
00:08:30,705 --> 00:08:33,075
platform or the portal and I need help.

158
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:36,315
And what the help I need is with,
I need to know what is the HR

159
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:41,065
policy for semi tenant leave in
US region or in California state.

160
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:42,115
And I'm searching for it.

161
00:08:42,615 --> 00:08:44,055
It cannot be preventive, right?

162
00:08:44,055 --> 00:08:45,525
How you can prevent me from.

163
00:08:46,175 --> 00:08:49,535
You cannot read my mind when I'm
gonna search next, but yes, it's an

164
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:52,595
opportunity of deflection because
somewhere there's a knowledge article,

165
00:08:52,655 --> 00:08:53,945
which will have this information.

166
00:08:54,275 --> 00:08:58,475
Any company will have a policy or a
guidelines, what you all are eligible for.

167
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:04,235
If I can automatically search that
content and provide it to you handy,

168
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:06,095
then I don't have to talk to anyone.

169
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:07,595
I'm just checking policy.

170
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:11,945
Do I need to talk to anyone to say hey or
otherwise I'll reach to our support staff,

171
00:09:11,945 --> 00:09:13,805
say, can you share this policy with me?

172
00:09:13,805 --> 00:09:14,460
I need to know the policy.

173
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,320
They'll attach the K article to the ticket
or incident I created and say, Hey, this

174
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,820
is what you were looking for closed.

175
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,070
He's not gonna sit on a
call and explain that to me.

176
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,750
So similar to that, do I want even my
users to create such tickets or incident?

177
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:26,960
Maybe?

178
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,170
No.

179
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:33,740
And that's a perfect example or a perfect
case of deflection, how we can deflect

180
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:38,090
something which doesn't necessarily need
to be created as a ticket or an incident

181
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,980
and provide faster help to the user.

182
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,570
For example, another I would just say is.

183
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,540
Somebody comes to a virtual agent
or a search and say, Hey, I need

184
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,430
or maybe my laptop is running slow.

185
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,270
I need help.

186
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,859
Can I have some automation in place,
which can already check the health of

187
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:57,050
my machine and tell me, Hey, we noticed
that your machine is running up to

188
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,780
date and all the patches are upgraded.

189
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:00,920
Nothing wrong.

190
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,730
You might have observed a CPU sky spike
or performance issues because it hasn't

191
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,050
been restarted for almost a month.

192
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,480
Can you please try restart
and maybe it works.

193
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:10,685
Okay, person restarts the machine.

194
00:10:10,685 --> 00:10:12,064
It's working all good.

195
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:14,435
Plus one deflection.

196
00:10:14,765 --> 00:10:16,745
So these are some of the
example of deflection.

197
00:10:16,745 --> 00:10:23,495
Hey, how we can best deflect the issues
that people don't even create them.

198
00:10:24,064 --> 00:10:28,055
And then next, from the automates,
just by sharing some information,

199
00:10:28,055 --> 00:10:32,885
troubleshooting on behalf of me, you
cannot deflect me from creating an issue.

200
00:10:33,335 --> 00:10:36,155
But these are the categories where,
which are more like requests.

201
00:10:36,155 --> 00:10:37,295
You can think about it, right?

202
00:10:37,445 --> 00:10:39,665
How AI can automate it.

203
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:43,175
Workers can be the part,
workflow automations can do this.

204
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:49,015
Simplest example would be anyone needs
a software or access to something

205
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,485
to perform their day-to-day jobs.

206
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:52,625
Let's say I'm new to the company, right?

207
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,575
I have to start working
on ServiceNow platform.

208
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:56,945
I don't have access and
I have to request access.

209
00:10:57,395 --> 00:10:58,625
You cannot deflect.

210
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:01,245
You cannot prevent, this is not a
prevention case or this is not a

211
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:05,535
deflection case, so I need access
and I, I definitely need access to

212
00:11:05,535 --> 00:11:07,215
day to perform my day-to-day duties.

213
00:11:07,545 --> 00:11:13,215
So how you can automate it as an
end-to-end workflow so that rather

214
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:16,485
than waiting for somebody to give me
access to the environment, and then

215
00:11:16,485 --> 00:11:18,990
asking me multiple questions, which
role you need, which access you need.

216
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,010
It identifies my intent, which
organization I'm part of.

217
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,170
What is my role based on my profile?

218
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,900
Okay, you need access to
ServiceNow environment.

219
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,060
Is this what you need based on your role?

220
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,110
You're eligible for this.

221
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,890
I'm going to brand this good
if in case it depends, right?

222
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,300
What kind of access it is.

223
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,190
If it needs approval, you
can always bring in approval.

224
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,710
But that think about it as
an end-to-end automation.

225
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,150
Somebody is requesting access,
this person is getting an access

226
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,010
without any human agent involvement.

227
00:11:47,595 --> 00:11:49,995
That is a perfect example of automation.

228
00:11:50,495 --> 00:11:52,295
The next is augment.

229
00:11:52,595 --> 00:11:55,715
Let's say we cannot do any of these three.

230
00:11:56,525 --> 00:12:00,215
So what we, what can we do
augment how we can do it?

231
00:12:00,275 --> 00:12:04,325
Let's say I'm not able to prevent, I'm
not able to deflect user needs help,

232
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:08,465
I'm not able to automate because it's
not one of the cases or repetitive

233
00:12:08,465 --> 00:12:09,875
tasks which we have automated yet.

234
00:12:10,535 --> 00:12:11,615
So then we augment.

235
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:12,605
That means.

236
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:17,855
The person still came, asked for
assistance, asked for help, but

237
00:12:17,855 --> 00:12:21,665
couldn't self solve it by any
other ways, so he still could then

238
00:12:21,665 --> 00:12:23,045
goes ahead and creates a ticket.

239
00:12:23,545 --> 00:12:28,795
That is, how much we say is how we
can augment that user or the support

240
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:34,465
agent who is working on that ticket by
using ai, gen, ai, any other features,

241
00:12:34,465 --> 00:12:37,825
machine learning so that they can
better and faster resolver that.

242
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:41,125
So the request or an
issue that a user created.

243
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:46,005
Which took 30 minutes to be
resolved or troubleshooted earlier.

244
00:12:46,455 --> 00:12:50,415
With all this AI in picture and all
advancements, it just hardly takes

245
00:12:50,415 --> 00:12:51,735
five to 10 minutes now maximum.

246
00:12:51,915 --> 00:12:54,615
So that's like meantime
to resolve reduction.

247
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,530
You are, almost all of you
were, are familiar with this

248
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,240
term, and that's what it can do.

249
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,930
Maybe it cannot avoid an incident or an
issue to be created at the first place.

250
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:05,989
But it definitely will
help to close it faster.

251
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:10,069
So that's the overall idea about,
obviously you want to prevent, deflect

252
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:13,904
or automate, but at least if you are
not able to do any of these, please

253
00:13:13,904 --> 00:13:18,674
try to augment so you can at least
increase operational efficiency and more

254
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:20,594
productivity gains for your support staff.

255
00:13:21,404 --> 00:13:24,614
So when we talk about this when
we are talking about approach, I

256
00:13:24,614 --> 00:13:26,054
want to highlight one thing, right?

257
00:13:26,054 --> 00:13:26,444
Because.

258
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:31,319
Many customers ask me this question,
Hey, if you are saying you have

259
00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:34,289
achieved service desk and this has
been your approach, are you saying that

260
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:35,609
you don't even have a service desk?

261
00:13:35,609 --> 00:13:35,879
People?

262
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:37,649
Where did, where do those people go?

263
00:13:38,489 --> 00:13:42,269
So those are leveraged
for other tasks, right?

264
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,389
They don't have to do this L one support.

265
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:49,474
Either they can be all two one
way, or they can be part of some

266
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:51,934
another organization based on
their interest in something, right?

267
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:56,464
Or you provide a premium support
to all your VP VIPs or your

268
00:13:56,464 --> 00:14:00,514
employees because there will
always be one of those scenarios.

269
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:02,244
Which you cannot automate request.

270
00:14:02,574 --> 00:14:05,544
The best value or the biggest
value that we have achieved with

271
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,254
this is a flat support staff.

272
00:14:08,004 --> 00:14:11,774
So from last five, six years the employee
growth for ServiceNow has been like this.

273
00:14:11,774 --> 00:14:14,114
Like it's really growing at a fast pace.

274
00:14:14,594 --> 00:14:19,694
Now, am I hiring the same number of
people or support staff so that I can

275
00:14:19,694 --> 00:14:24,834
have that scale so that I have ample
amount of support staff to support

276
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:26,514
those employees on my user base?

277
00:14:26,844 --> 00:14:27,055
No.

278
00:14:28,015 --> 00:14:32,035
We used to have 2030 and the organization
remained flat for so many years,

279
00:14:32,035 --> 00:14:33,655
and now we don't even have, right?

280
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:39,745
So it is an evolution of it, of time, and
when we call ourselves zero service desk.

281
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:42,915
I always say for every
company it can be different.

282
00:14:43,155 --> 00:14:48,225
For our words, if I hit the target of 90%
self-service, we will call ourself zero

283
00:14:48,225 --> 00:14:52,694
service desk for other company, maybe
bigger than us, smaller than us different

284
00:14:52,755 --> 00:14:54,375
objectives, different leadership, right?

285
00:14:54,405 --> 00:14:55,814
They can have a different number in mind.

286
00:14:55,814 --> 00:14:58,844
Hey, when we achieve 85%
self-service, maybe then we'll

287
00:14:58,844 --> 00:15:00,015
call our zero service desk.

288
00:15:00,435 --> 00:15:02,625
So it can be different, it can vary.

289
00:15:02,865 --> 00:15:06,285
But yes, the ultimate goal is
to enable more self-service.

290
00:15:06,795 --> 00:15:12,165
By ai, by automation, by orchestration,
by bringing all these tools together

291
00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:16,695
and how that we achieve it so that
users can help get, help faster.

292
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:17,685
That's the overall idea.

293
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:22,515
How you can help your employee base,
help your support staff to better

294
00:15:22,515 --> 00:15:26,445
evolve with evolution of technologies,
with the evolution of platforms

295
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:28,635
and evolution of our era, right?

296
00:15:28,635 --> 00:15:29,745
Like where we are today.

297
00:15:30,245 --> 00:15:34,925
So let's talk about
now what all things we.

298
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,459
Highly dependent on, or how we integrated
to achieve the zero service desk.

299
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:44,169
From an architectural standpoint,
I think I briefly touched upon it

300
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:45,819
is the predictive analysis, right?

301
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:49,589
Understanding the intent of the
user, what user needs whether it's

302
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:53,759
just by helping them to get some
knowledge to them, whether I need to

303
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:56,999
have an automation inflow, because
that's what they are requesting.

304
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,999
So understanding the intent
becomes really important here.

305
00:16:00,404 --> 00:16:02,774
And one thing, which I call
about, if you see in the middle,

306
00:16:02,774 --> 00:16:04,004
it's ServiceNow platform, right?

307
00:16:04,034 --> 00:16:07,784
All our work happens in the
platform as a ServiceNow.

308
00:16:07,784 --> 00:16:11,364
Being a company, obviously we use
our platform very extensively.

309
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:15,504
So the first thing we did was make
sure, but there were different ways of

310
00:16:15,504 --> 00:16:17,034
how people will try to get help, right?

311
00:16:17,094 --> 00:16:21,174
Either they will call the service desk or
they will try the virtual agent, right?

312
00:16:21,324 --> 00:16:22,644
I know you have all heard about it.

313
00:16:23,004 --> 00:16:26,284
And just start a conversation
with the bot and try to get help.

314
00:16:26,974 --> 00:16:29,344
But if people start calling
and they have multiple ways of

315
00:16:29,344 --> 00:16:32,314
communicating, then it becomes really
challenging to achieve this goal.

316
00:16:32,404 --> 00:16:36,964
So the first step was how to consolidate,
have everything and just to have one

317
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:41,794
standardized way of how people will get
help or how our user base will get help.

318
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:46,054
That was the important because that was
not just a technology focus, but that was

319
00:16:46,054 --> 00:16:48,034
a human behavior change focus as well.

320
00:16:48,064 --> 00:16:51,634
How we, change the behavior of
people where they always come

321
00:16:51,634 --> 00:16:53,134
to watch agent for help, right?

322
00:16:53,134 --> 00:16:55,564
They don't call the help desk
or a human agent for help.

323
00:16:56,134 --> 00:16:59,704
That was the first driver that
helped us achieve this and

324
00:16:59,704 --> 00:17:01,024
ServiceNow platform, right?

325
00:17:01,564 --> 00:17:05,254
It has it incident management problem
and all those it and some features,

326
00:17:05,614 --> 00:17:07,144
plus it has workflows, right?

327
00:17:07,204 --> 00:17:10,804
Like knowledge base, all that is
maintained in ServiceNow platform,

328
00:17:10,924 --> 00:17:13,834
plus an integration with other third
party as well, let's say SharePoint.

329
00:17:14,254 --> 00:17:17,884
Or you can have automation workflows
with any other software vendor if

330
00:17:17,884 --> 00:17:19,594
it is for software or anything.

331
00:17:20,024 --> 00:17:22,724
But that was, but the core of everything,
I would still call it a ServiceNow

332
00:17:23,144 --> 00:17:27,014
platform and that's why I call it when
we call zero service desk, that's where

333
00:17:27,014 --> 00:17:29,144
I say how we are using our own platform.

334
00:17:29,864 --> 00:17:33,554
Providing that L one support
to the customer or the employee

335
00:17:34,124 --> 00:17:35,714
rather than having a human agent.

336
00:17:36,044 --> 00:17:40,534
And by doing all this, what
I'm getting is obviously.

337
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:46,219
Being healthy environment, I can
audit how everything is working.

338
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:50,149
And I can achieve greater successes
with having a platform, right?

339
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:52,279
I don't have to invest
in support staff more.

340
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:57,769
So overall, the idea is how we can
incorporate ServiceNow platform, machine

341
00:17:57,769 --> 00:18:03,589
learning, ai, and bring it all together
so I get better results in term of my

342
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:07,394
performance, my health, and eventually
get to that self-service model.

343
00:18:07,894 --> 00:18:12,544
Because that was the real crucial
thing is getting to the zero service

344
00:18:12,544 --> 00:18:16,774
desk, but definitely having governance
in place to manage and monitor it.

345
00:18:17,274 --> 00:18:20,994
Now, I think a little bit touched upon
it when I was describing the previous

346
00:18:20,994 --> 00:18:24,294
slide, but governance is important, right?

347
00:18:24,954 --> 00:18:28,264
Especially when you're using
ai, especially security is

348
00:18:28,264 --> 00:18:29,344
a big thing today, right?

349
00:18:29,344 --> 00:18:30,454
With AI in picture.

350
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:35,434
So definitely we have to make sure we
govern all our processes, we govern

351
00:18:35,434 --> 00:18:39,364
all our tools, all our policies,
and especially the ai, right?

352
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:43,474
So different types of governance, if
you see on my screen, are listed there,

353
00:18:43,474 --> 00:18:47,104
especially the first one, very important
one is the AI and decision governance.

354
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:52,474
We have to have ethics and proper
guidelines in place before even we

355
00:18:52,474 --> 00:18:55,084
start implementing any use cases for ai.

356
00:18:56,044 --> 00:18:59,074
Especially when before, at least
before even you take it to production.

357
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:02,104
Some organization I know do a
small POC to test it, whether it's

358
00:19:02,104 --> 00:19:06,244
possible, those are mostly internal
resources, but definitely right.

359
00:19:06,634 --> 00:19:11,189
If there are no guardrails in
ai it can harm any company their

360
00:19:11,189 --> 00:19:12,509
reputation value in a biggest way.

361
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:16,169
So definitely make sure you
have proper security in place

362
00:19:16,499 --> 00:19:18,060
before you leverage an AI.

363
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,149
Here at ServiceNow, we definitely
go through AR b approvals.

364
00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:24,120
Our products are already certified,
what have been launched in the market.

365
00:19:24,594 --> 00:19:28,434
But when we are implementing anything
entirely, we make sure we go through

366
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:33,384
the data governance team and like
ERB Architecture Review Board to

367
00:19:33,384 --> 00:19:37,284
make sure they approve whatever
integration or outcomes we are looking

368
00:19:37,284 --> 00:19:40,134
for, and they sign off on, Hey, we
are going in the right direction.

369
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:41,589
So that is really important here.

370
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:44,069
And then obviously risk
and compliance, right?

371
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:48,809
Definitely every company should have a
compliance and governance team, right?

372
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:53,039
Everyone is spending so much on
investing in security these days.

373
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:54,419
Definitely.

374
00:19:54,899 --> 00:19:58,349
Do we need to have a risk review,
security review just to make sure.

375
00:19:59,235 --> 00:20:00,495
Especially the permissions, right?

376
00:20:00,524 --> 00:20:03,885
Even if let's say you have to integrate
two systems, you, everyone uses service

377
00:20:03,885 --> 00:20:06,195
accounts or secrets to integrate.

378
00:20:06,764 --> 00:20:11,105
Now how and what roles you
provide to those secrets.

379
00:20:11,195 --> 00:20:15,064
Even like what is just having
a guardrail around what that

380
00:20:15,064 --> 00:20:16,449
integration or workflow is gonna do.

381
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,070
So that it doesn't disrupt what,
whatever that system is supposed to do.

382
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,950
If I'm just as an example, I give
you, if this particular automation or

383
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:32,780
integration is only supposed to, let's
say restart let's say Zoom client on

384
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:38,880
my machine it isn't supposed to do a
look at my Outlook data or my actually

385
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,410
meeting details of a Zoom, right?

386
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:42,585
But just restart privileges.

387
00:20:42,615 --> 00:20:43,245
That's it.

388
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:44,175
Nothing else.

389
00:20:44,685 --> 00:20:46,095
Then we should verify.

390
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:49,545
And some security review, compliance
review should happen that yes, it is

391
00:20:49,545 --> 00:20:52,035
actually doing what it is intended
to do and nothing more than that.

392
00:20:52,665 --> 00:20:54,195
So that piece is really crucial.

393
00:20:54,825 --> 00:20:57,615
And last piece, but not
least, is governance from a

394
00:20:57,615 --> 00:20:59,445
performance standpoint, right?

395
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,835
I was talking about zero service
desk and I talked about self-service.

396
00:21:02,835 --> 00:21:05,295
So now specifically in that
scenario, if I talk about

397
00:21:05,295 --> 00:21:08,145
self-service, how we measure ourself.

398
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:12,585
The important step here is when we
started this Journey to Zero service

399
00:21:12,585 --> 00:21:16,795
Desk, we we wanted to obviously monitor.

400
00:21:16,915 --> 00:21:17,695
We had a target.

401
00:21:17,695 --> 00:21:20,065
Hey, we want to reach 90% self-service.

402
00:21:21,055 --> 00:21:23,305
How did I pick that 90% number?

403
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:27,685
If I don't know how I'm performing
today, it's very difficult

404
00:21:28,045 --> 00:21:29,515
to measure in future as well.

405
00:21:29,845 --> 00:21:34,345
I need to know how, what are my
performance indicators today, like

406
00:21:34,405 --> 00:21:37,225
as an example, I said, like you see
on the screen ticket deflection rate.

407
00:21:37,659 --> 00:21:41,740
Is there any deflection happening
today or it is zero, maybe 10%, 5%,

408
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,850
but something might be happening?

409
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,680
Or if there is nothing, that's fine too.

410
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,955
But I should know the way
how I should measure it.

411
00:21:48,315 --> 00:21:53,145
I should need to have a proper
formula being reviewed and then make

412
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:59,360
sure how they are like leveraged
across organization, how everyone.

413
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,910
How everyone understands it,
how it is trending over time.

414
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,640
So at least when I reach 90%,
I should be able to say with

415
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,070
confidence, yes, I'm 90% right.

416
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:13,660
So we have definitely have dashboards,
reports where every day we are

417
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,880
monitoring these KPIs because these
gives us a an ability to continuously

418
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,290
improve and innovate as well.

419
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,300
Because once I hit 90%,
I'm not like, done, okay.

420
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,500
I'm sitting, I'm not doing anything.

421
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:30,050
We have to evolve, and that numbers,
that validation, that KPIs, if we track

422
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,700
those KPIs, they'll help us to evolve.

423
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,160
And if something goes wrong,
they'll help us to get better.

424
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:38,810
Now, today, if I, let's say, achieve
90%, doesn't mean I might not go to 80%.

425
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:39,770
It might happen, right?

426
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:40,520
If something breaks.

427
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,500
So if I don't govern my workflows, if
I don't have performance indicators,

428
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,220
and if I don't measure how it,
how is my self-service doing,

429
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,860
then I won't be able to scale it.

430
00:22:52,305 --> 00:22:56,685
So that type of governance, your
performance governance is really crucial

431
00:22:56,715 --> 00:23:01,405
and that's how we are doing it today and
hopefully you'll always need to do it.

432
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:02,785
Metrics is really important.

433
00:23:03,285 --> 00:23:07,065
Measurable outcomes that we achieved
as of s out of service desk first.

434
00:23:07,065 --> 00:23:10,995
And the more important I really like it
is the incident reduction, and that's

435
00:23:10,995 --> 00:23:12,375
where I talked about scalability, right?

436
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:16,395
If the employee base is growing or the
user base who needs support is growing,

437
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,975
doesn't mean I hire more people to
just support those employees, right?

438
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:23,310
So that's where we have to think about
scalability, which will eventually,

439
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,460
if I self-heal, I'll self automate.

440
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,070
The ultimate value I'm achieving is
I have incident reduction, so I don't

441
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:33,880
need more people to work on tickets
because whatever I built, especially the

442
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,400
self-service model, it'll help you scale.

443
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,720
If I have built a model or an
automation, say anytime anyone

444
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,570
get, ask for an access to Adobe.

445
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:48,595
This is a workflow which should
add, like run, execute, and then

446
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:49,585
people will not raise tickets.

447
00:23:49,585 --> 00:23:54,115
Now, even if I have 20,000, 30,000,
50,000 employees, it doesn't matter

448
00:23:54,115 --> 00:23:57,925
that workflow or the automation, the
predictive analysis, any, everything

449
00:23:57,925 --> 00:24:02,035
will work the same way and maybe even
better over time with more learning.

450
00:24:02,155 --> 00:24:04,045
So that's what the overall idea was.

451
00:24:04,105 --> 00:24:06,385
Now think about it, you
have a reduced incident.

452
00:24:06,775 --> 00:24:09,865
You're not hiring more people
with, as your organization is

453
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,395
scaling, what does it bring?

454
00:24:11,905 --> 00:24:12,535
Cost savings.

455
00:24:12,895 --> 00:24:15,745
We are, you don't need to invest more
in people or organization just to

456
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:18,955
support those employees because they
might be doing more important tasks

457
00:24:18,955 --> 00:24:20,515
just than providing them L one support.

458
00:24:20,665 --> 00:24:25,435
Then overall, this helps us achieve the
user satisfaction because everything you

459
00:24:25,435 --> 00:24:30,595
do, and we also, when we did everything,
we made sure the employee experience or

460
00:24:30,775 --> 00:24:35,515
our user experience is not disrupted and
that actually improved over time because

461
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:36,865
they are now getting the faster help.

462
00:24:37,645 --> 00:24:40,405
They're not waiting in the queue
for somebody to come and help them.

463
00:24:40,465 --> 00:24:43,375
It's a faster response
time, better result.

464
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:48,965
So definitely not only just, it helped
us get that user fix satisfaction or

465
00:24:48,965 --> 00:24:51,095
experience, but even improved on it.

466
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:55,355
And obviously with user satisfaction
and everything, less downtime.

467
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,110
Greater productivity.

468
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,610
That's without any doubt, right?

469
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,330
If no incidents you're you can use that.

470
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:05,540
People are more innovation task
and rather than just providing the

471
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,750
L one support you have, you are
directly getting productivity gains.

472
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,830
And overall, everything of this will
help any company's business grow.

473
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:19,035
So last let's briefly touch based upon
it, what's the future of us, right?

474
00:25:19,035 --> 00:25:22,380
If we have already achieved
this autonomous IT service desk.

475
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,520
What is the future?

476
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,970
I think more companies are, I would say
diving into this one our ServiceNow,

477
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:30,040
our focus is autonomous enterprise.

478
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,050
And I think for many
companies it's the same.

479
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:37,320
Specifically, what interests me and what
I am the driver for is the autonomous it.

480
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,150
I know everyone is thinking like others.

481
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,520
We are thinking Autonomous
service desk, we did it.

482
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,870
Now we are thinking about.

483
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:49,080
Complete autonomous it, whether it's
network space, in fraud space, everything

484
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,610
that operations touch should be in
some way or fashion, autonomous, right?

485
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:57,570
So that, that's the north side of the
future and I hope we definitely reach it.

486
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:01,050
People are investing, like especially
in hr, finance, legal, everyone

487
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,820
is investing in autonomous space.

488
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:09,350
So definitely like others, we are also
and, the second part is AI ops, right?

489
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,370
We are doing it.

490
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:14,780
We had to do it a little bit of predictive
to get this zero service desk, but we have

491
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,930
to be more predictive and less reactive.

492
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:20,240
Reactive, obviously, I wouldn't
say we are reactive at.

493
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:24,065
This stage, but we are still some
of the use cases, I would still say

494
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:28,745
we are proactive like we identify,
but we have to be predictive, right?

495
00:26:28,775 --> 00:26:32,315
Which is more important and that
comes in observability area.

496
00:26:32,495 --> 00:26:37,835
So we are deep double downing on
that and just making sure how we

497
00:26:37,835 --> 00:26:39,545
can be that predictive organization.

498
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:42,470
And then obviously embedded
flows into it, right?

499
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,440
We are using machine learning, we are
using ai, but now we have to double

500
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,510
dive on how we can incorporate our
agent workers gen workforce origin

501
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:53,930
framework, I would say, into all
these workflows that we are trying

502
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:57,830
to automate so that we can really
reach that autonomous enterprise goal.

503
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:01,180
And then obviously continuous improvement.

504
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,780
That is the key that will never
go anywhere, wherever we reach.

505
00:27:05,395 --> 00:27:06,445
Continuous improvement.

506
00:27:06,445 --> 00:27:08,575
Next level should always be there.

507
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:12,775
And same way for me, for us, for
the company, we are definitely

508
00:27:12,775 --> 00:27:16,375
investing again and double diving
and obviously always work on this

509
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:19,495
continuous optimization and improvement.

510
00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:25,495
So I'm hoping this helped everyone of you
to understand what is Zero service desk,

511
00:27:25,585 --> 00:27:27,620
what we have achieved, where we are going.

512
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,950
So thank you so much for your
time and listening to me.

513
00:27:31,555 --> 00:27:32,185
Have a good day.

514
00:27:32,185 --> 00:27:33,025
Thank you.
