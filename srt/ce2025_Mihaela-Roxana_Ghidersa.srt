1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,020
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,519 --> 00:00:02,810
My name is Mihaela Guitarsa.

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,880
Happy to be with you here today.

4
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,470
Thank you to the organizers for giving
me the opportunity to share what I love

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:14,540
and what I've learned into my experiences
and challenges that I had along the way.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,140
At my core, I'm an engineer and I also
like, even though it seems being an

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,523
engineer and someone that does some
public speaking, it's not really going

8
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:27,944
together, but I really like to do this
and Besides my interest in software

9
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:32,144
and technology, I like to research
and prepare content that I gather from

10
00:00:32,164 --> 00:00:36,474
my experiences or from things that I
would have liked to know at some point.

11
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:38,584
And I didn't have anyone to tell me.

12
00:00:39,184 --> 00:00:43,014
And I wrapped this in my presentation
and, opened the conversation

13
00:00:43,024 --> 00:00:44,364
in events like this one today.

14
00:00:44,364 --> 00:00:47,514
So thank you to the organizers
for having me again.

15
00:00:48,154 --> 00:00:48,474
And.

16
00:00:49,139 --> 00:00:53,919
I hope that we have a beautiful
conversation or that I at least

17
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:59,349
challenge you a bit to go outside of
your, your area of looking at things.

18
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:06,259
Why I'm saying this because today's
conversation, it's going into the area of

19
00:01:06,589 --> 00:01:11,149
Not so much technicalities, but the way we
are looking at the problems and challenges

20
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:16,479
that we encounter every day, the way that
we organize our work, the way we think

21
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:22,089
about ourselves as developers, I'm trying
to open the conversation about how we

22
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:27,969
are interacting with, with our work and
with our challenges on, on a daily basis.

23
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:33,709
So I want to open the conversation
with a little exercise, an

24
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:35,149
imagination exercise, basically.

25
00:01:35,949 --> 00:01:39,929
Think that you're standing at the
base of a towering skyscraper and you

26
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:41,849
marvel at its intrinsic design, right?

27
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:46,219
Every element in the structure,
it was meticulously planned.

28
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:49,439
Each element is serving a
purpose in the overall structure.

29
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,739
Now let's think about the
architect who designed that.

30
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,919
How they had to envision
all those interactions.

31
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:03,249
How their building is going to stand
We stand the test of time and face

32
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:09,059
storms and all sorts of challenges,
serve its occupants, how everything

33
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:14,379
was so purposeful thought of in order
to have the best structure in the end.

34
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:17,899
So starting with this mindset,
we can transform the way

35
00:02:17,899 --> 00:02:18,799
we are building software.

36
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:24,509
Taking this kind of concepts from another
field encourages us to think beyond the

37
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:28,479
immediate, to consider the long term
impact of our decisions, and to create

38
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,819
systems that are not just functional, but
resilient, and scalable, and enduring.

39
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:35,294
I want to for your attention.

40
00:02:35,474 --> 00:02:38,104
tasks to stay with this
analogy in our mind.

41
00:02:38,264 --> 00:02:42,984
We are not just coding, we are building
something of a digital skyscraper.

42
00:02:43,484 --> 00:02:45,424
Let's explore how we can build
them with the same level of

43
00:02:45,474 --> 00:02:47,604
care, creativity, and foresight.

44
00:02:47,694 --> 00:02:52,724
Because as programmers, we often
find it challenging to step back

45
00:02:52,724 --> 00:02:55,744
and see our products like we are
looking at a building, right?

46
00:02:56,144 --> 00:02:59,624
Most of the time we are deeply
engrossed in our tasks, and unlike

47
00:02:59,624 --> 00:03:04,984
physical construction, we don't have
the same boundaries, very strict,

48
00:03:04,994 --> 00:03:06,254
very exact boundaries, right?

49
00:03:06,704 --> 00:03:09,404
Software development does not
have the same limitations.

50
00:03:09,684 --> 00:03:13,774
We have freedom and we have flexibility to
push these boundaries, actually push the

51
00:03:13,774 --> 00:03:15,794
boundaries of what's possible in the end.

52
00:03:16,194 --> 00:03:22,894
So despite this freedom, when we discuss
perspective and way of thinking, we tend

53
00:03:22,904 --> 00:03:27,474
to stick to familiar patterns, rules,
and we rarely venture outside the box.

54
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:31,524
And even when we do, We may not
really embrace new ways of thinking,

55
00:03:31,574 --> 00:03:35,554
we feel comfortable to stick to our
existing beliefs, but by breaking

56
00:03:35,554 --> 00:03:37,034
the cycle through reflection.

57
00:03:37,414 --> 00:03:40,474
We can adopt the growth mindset
that leads to better decisions and

58
00:03:40,474 --> 00:03:41,994
a more fulfilling work experience.

59
00:03:42,364 --> 00:03:47,354
And mindset in this case refers to
attitudes and beliefs that shape the

60
00:03:47,354 --> 00:03:51,344
way we approach work, the way we solve
problems, the way we tackle challenges.

61
00:03:51,914 --> 00:03:56,734
It's the lens through which we view our
abilities, tasks, and potential for work,

62
00:03:56,754 --> 00:03:59,724
and the way we actually face challenges.

63
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:06,979
Brace for impact when difficult situations
appear and when we're discussing mindset,

64
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:12,959
we cannot stop, we cannot avoid stopping
actually and looking at ourselves.

65
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,039
And if you've ever thought, okay,
I'm just not good at algorithms.

66
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:19,859
I'll never understand this framework.

67
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:23,529
Instead of, I don't understand
this yet, but I can figure it out.

68
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:26,529
You are tapping into fixed mindset.

69
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:29,684
Because this perspective
limits your growth.

70
00:04:30,364 --> 00:04:32,734
It creates a mental barrier
to learning and adaptation.

71
00:04:33,004 --> 00:04:36,764
Developers with a fixed mindset shy
away from challenges, fearing that

72
00:04:36,764 --> 00:04:38,854
failure will expose their limitations.

73
00:04:39,214 --> 00:04:42,264
In contrast, a growth mindset
is the belief that abilities and

74
00:04:42,264 --> 00:04:46,094
intelligence can be developed through
dedication, learning, hard work.

75
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:49,384
People with a growth mindset
embrace challenges and view

76
00:04:49,394 --> 00:04:51,234
failures as opportunities to learn.

77
00:04:51,734 --> 00:04:55,234
So we need to be very honest with
ourselves and see exactly where we are.

78
00:04:55,524 --> 00:05:00,944
And I'm not asking you right now to tell
me, okay, what, where are you, where do

79
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:05,404
you find yourself more, but more like
I want you to be honest with yourself.

80
00:05:05,854 --> 00:05:09,554
Because in the end, the scope
of this discussion is to set

81
00:05:09,604 --> 00:05:10,754
a starting point for growth.

82
00:05:11,304 --> 00:05:14,554
And since we're discussing about
starting point, I think it's a good

83
00:05:14,554 --> 00:05:17,344
thing to bring to discussion a story.

84
00:05:17,844 --> 00:05:21,404
And I heard a while ago, I think I was,
I don't know, doing some volunteering

85
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:24,684
and someone told me, so I don't
know who is the author, whoever is,

86
00:05:25,104 --> 00:05:26,654
copyrights to you, credits to you.

87
00:05:27,154 --> 00:05:28,794
But the story goes like this.

88
00:05:29,284 --> 00:05:32,274
There were some people
on the breaking stones.

89
00:05:32,884 --> 00:05:37,334
And then there is this man that was
going towards the hill and he got curious

90
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:38,304
and asked one of the people, okay.

91
00:05:38,804 --> 00:05:39,494
What are you doing?

92
00:05:40,004 --> 00:05:42,004
And that person was very
focused on the artwork.

93
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:44,704
And they were bothered by the question.

94
00:05:45,314 --> 00:05:47,364
No, they didn't like to be
disturbed from their work

95
00:05:47,364 --> 00:05:48,524
because they were very dedicated.

96
00:05:49,054 --> 00:05:51,124
And yet he answered and
said, I am breaking stones.

97
00:05:51,624 --> 00:05:54,684
The man got very curious and he went
to another and to another until at

98
00:05:54,684 --> 00:05:56,604
some point he got a different response.

99
00:05:56,854 --> 00:06:01,414
Because this last person that he asked
told him, I am building a castle.

100
00:06:01,914 --> 00:06:04,024
As developers we grow new faces, right?

101
00:06:04,024 --> 00:06:09,884
Sometimes we simply complete tasks and
we are just so focused in that area

102
00:06:09,884 --> 00:06:12,664
that we complete the entire context.

103
00:06:13,044 --> 00:06:13,994
So we are breaking stones.

104
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:14,444
Okay.

105
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:19,054
On other times, we are interesting
in understanding the system and going

106
00:06:19,064 --> 00:06:23,374
beyond the task and trying to understand
the business, maybe very dedicated,

107
00:06:23,394 --> 00:06:26,714
trying to improve and so on, which
is like building castles, right?

108
00:06:27,644 --> 00:06:30,014
There are many reasons
this imbalance happens.

109
00:06:30,594 --> 00:06:33,274
Sometimes it's the organizations
where we are working.

110
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:36,394
Sometimes it's the limitation to
information, to the right information.

111
00:06:36,634 --> 00:06:41,084
Lack of options, fear, burnout,
not caring about a project.

112
00:06:41,084 --> 00:06:43,194
this is a reality that we
have to be honest about.

113
00:06:43,434 --> 00:06:46,584
Or maybe we're just the right,
the wrong person for the job.

114
00:06:46,734 --> 00:06:47,374
this happens.

115
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:52,574
But I feel that we are so
impacted by outside factors and

116
00:06:52,574 --> 00:06:53,944
we are so overwhelmed with it.

117
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:59,314
Checking some sort of what is the image
of the great developer at some point,

118
00:06:59,314 --> 00:07:02,274
like we have that thing with the effective
developer or efficient developer.

119
00:07:02,684 --> 00:07:05,474
Should I be an effective developer,
one that takes time to ensure

120
00:07:05,474 --> 00:07:08,254
code is clean and scalable and
documented, or should I be an

121
00:07:08,254 --> 00:07:14,194
efficient developer that I implement,
I loadbox, I deploy, I, this approach

122
00:07:14,194 --> 00:07:16,264
allows me a faster time to market.

123
00:07:17,094 --> 00:07:21,074
And, I'll just focus on speed,
skip this part with extended

124
00:07:21,694 --> 00:07:23,214
documentation and meetings and so on.

125
00:07:23,714 --> 00:07:26,434
We are trying to comply with some
patterns, but sometimes we have to look

126
00:07:26,434 --> 00:07:30,574
at ourselves as professional despite the
context in which we are at some point.

127
00:07:30,814 --> 00:07:32,314
So add our skills.

128
00:07:32,884 --> 00:07:38,424
And again, I dare you to be honest
and use the circle of competence

129
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:42,444
to understand what are your
strengths, your limits and expertise.

130
00:07:42,944 --> 00:07:46,994
Using this mental model in the end, it's
about focusing on what you know well and

131
00:07:46,994 --> 00:07:48,854
recognizing where your knowledge gaps are.

132
00:07:48,904 --> 00:07:52,424
And in this way, you can work
effectively with your expertise

133
00:07:52,424 --> 00:07:53,544
while expanding it over time.

134
00:07:54,124 --> 00:07:56,194
So we can start from the
inside circle, right?

135
00:07:56,764 --> 00:07:57,814
Identifying that.

136
00:07:58,614 --> 00:08:02,164
Seeing what are your strengths, what
technologies, languages, patterns,

137
00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:03,624
you truly understand at a deep level.

138
00:08:04,124 --> 00:08:05,364
Be honest about your limits.

139
00:08:05,654 --> 00:08:08,634
Stay focused on your areas of expertise
while delivering on current projects

140
00:08:08,634 --> 00:08:13,484
because this allows you to build
confidently and produce high quality work.

141
00:08:13,924 --> 00:08:17,924
When presented with tasks outside
your circle, collaborate with others,

142
00:08:18,054 --> 00:08:19,544
whose strengths complement yours.

143
00:08:19,924 --> 00:08:21,814
People that inspire
and you can learn from.

144
00:08:22,314 --> 00:08:26,064
While you're going outside in the
circle, outside of your, the stuff you

145
00:08:26,064 --> 00:08:30,484
know, identify knowledge gaps or areas
of interest that you want to grow into.

146
00:08:31,054 --> 00:08:32,434
Set clear goals.

147
00:08:33,134 --> 00:08:33,714
practice.

148
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:37,494
Take on projects that stretch
just outside your circle but

149
00:08:37,494 --> 00:08:38,574
are manageable with effort.

150
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:42,744
Of course, we're going in through
this process, we're having this

151
00:08:42,744 --> 00:08:44,904
process, taking into consideration.

152
00:08:45,404 --> 00:08:50,769
Helps you avoid a situation of
overextending your, and having

153
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:56,359
overconfidence, because you must be
cautious about assuming you're skilled

154
00:08:56,359 --> 00:09:00,839
in areas just because you've been working
at some point with something similar.

155
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:07,849
And there is this cognitive bias, the
Dunning Kruger effect, where it is

156
00:09:07,849 --> 00:09:13,309
demonstrated by this psychologist, a true
series of experiments that People with

157
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:17,289
low ability or knowledge in a specific
area tend to overestimate their skills,

158
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:21,879
while others with higher ability often
underestimate their skills, right?

159
00:09:22,619 --> 00:09:25,899
So this keeps a balance for
you to know exactly where

160
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,649
you are and don't overextend.

161
00:09:27,689 --> 00:09:31,419
I'm sure that each of you had a
situation at some point where you had

162
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:36,699
to deal with someone that was having
this bias and you were just so you

163
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:39,999
know, maybe pissed about the fact that
they are being so confident when you

164
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:41,169
know exactly how things should be.

165
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:42,309
So don't be that person.

166
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:48,499
On another part, there is this mental
barrier that we need to be careful about.

167
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:54,579
Because even if we don't realize, this
is something that is very powerful

168
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:56,209
and limiting at the same time.

169
00:09:56,489 --> 00:10:01,547
Because, let's say, if you identify as a
NET developer, you are a NET developer.

170
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:02,974
You are stuck.

171
00:10:03,754 --> 00:10:04,074
Right?

172
00:10:04,784 --> 00:10:07,374
in your mind, you are a
NET, or Java, or whatever.

173
00:10:07,414 --> 00:10:07,894
It doesn't matter.

174
00:10:08,164 --> 00:10:10,054
You are an ex developer.

175
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:16,989
But if you are identifying as a
developer who is using X, it can be

176
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:22,459
NET, Java, whatever, you suddenly can
be a programmer that knows and can

177
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:25,039
learn and can try other things too.

178
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:30,089
Just think of situations where you, maybe
someone in your company and said, okay,

179
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:33,879
we don't have a project right now that
it's using the skills that you have.

180
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:38,099
But look, there is this opening
in here, something that we think

181
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:39,389
that might be interesting to you.

182
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:41,879
technologies are going
to evolve, so try to not.

183
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:47,249
identify with them, try to keep your
mindset fluid in this area and don't

184
00:10:47,249 --> 00:10:49,249
block yourself into a, a bubble.

185
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:52,829
The circle of competence isn't
just about recognizing your skill,

186
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:54,259
it's a tool for growth in the end.

187
00:10:55,249 --> 00:10:59,269
When you understand where you excel and
where you need to improve, you can make

188
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:05,539
better decisions, you can work on yourself
constantly and become not efficient

189
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,339
or effective or, all sorts of labels.

190
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:12,759
But be a developer that is
bringing some impact in your work.

191
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:16,309
We've been discussing about the inner
circle, and we've been discussing

192
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:19,819
about that, circle where we know what
we don't know and we want to grow.

193
00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:24,229
But we also touched the areas
where we think we know something,

194
00:11:24,229 --> 00:11:25,139
but we actually don't know.

195
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:27,529
But how about that outside
circle, the thing that we

196
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:28,629
don't know that we don't know?

197
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:31,179
How do we tap into that area?

198
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:35,409
that area that I think that is the
area of blind spots, It's difficult to

199
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:38,729
understand the system we're a part of
precisely because there are blind spots.

200
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:40,949
We can't see what we are looking for.

201
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:44,209
We only see them at some point where
we have, we have somebody porting from

202
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:45,529
production or something like this.

203
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:50,639
And a way to do this, I found, of
course, a lot of the conversation

204
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:56,409
that we are having today has a lot
of points from the book, that can

205
00:11:56,409 --> 00:11:57,349
be found also in the book, but.

206
00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:05,179
This precisely got my attention because
these are three things that if we work

207
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:11,849
with are going to help us see the blind
spots that we have, to reveal those

208
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:16,909
blind spots and, at least minimize
that area if not completely, reveal it.

209
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:20,729
be that, of course, we are discussing,
I was mentioning the book, which is

210
00:12:20,729 --> 00:12:22,779
the great mental models by sheen purge.

211
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:26,699
And in the book, we have this three,
factors, perspective, ego induced denial

212
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:28,099
and distance from the consequences.

213
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:31,999
We need to approach problems with
different perspectives, even if it goes

214
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:34,289
on different models, mental frameworks.

215
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:37,569
We are going to discuss today some mental
models and some example of mental models.

216
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:41,989
So this is one area where we
need to expand our knowledge.

217
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:45,249
Then we need to lay low on the ego
and be honest and ask for help and

218
00:12:45,249 --> 00:12:46,699
accept that we are continuous students.

219
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,519
And we need to face and stay close
to the consequences of our decisions.

220
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:53,339
When we are making
decisions that we are not.

221
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,129
Assuming the consequences were, we
create that broken window effect, just

222
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:03,199
as an urban environments where one
broken window left unrepaired signals

223
00:13:03,369 --> 00:13:05,419
lack of care and invites more damage.

224
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:09,959
So also in our work, small
RSO issues in our code.

225
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:14,989
our mindset, our processes can accumulate,
leading to bigger problems over time.

226
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:21,049
If we don't address these issues as early
as possible, we risk letting all sorts of

227
00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:24,159
poor practices and blind spots take root.

228
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,659
So it becomes harder and
harder to solve problems.

229
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,009
And going further in the
perspective part, because this is

230
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,349
maybe the most powerful of them.

231
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,489
You know how in school we are learning.

232
00:13:37,989 --> 00:13:40,109
are learning about different areas, right?

233
00:13:40,109 --> 00:13:45,969
We are learning about physics
and biology and math and all

234
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:47,569
psychology, economics and so on.

235
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:53,569
And we are, we've been learning
and creating this way of

236
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:55,289
thinking in departments, right?

237
00:13:55,669 --> 00:14:00,259
But in the real world, we need to
combine these departments because

238
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:04,854
problems in the real world are
not Divide it so precisely, right?

239
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:07,424
So we need to work on our
multidisciplinary mindset,

240
00:14:08,104 --> 00:14:10,464
because if we don't, we miss
the full picture of a problem.

241
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:17,254
And our next step is not going to be the,
the closest to the best, if not the best.

242
00:14:17,894 --> 00:14:21,264
If a single worldview dominates
our thinking, we'll try to explain

243
00:14:21,284 --> 00:14:24,054
every problem through that lens,
even if it's not the right fit.

244
00:14:24,584 --> 00:14:27,614
the old saying with, to the man
with only hammer, everything

245
00:14:27,614 --> 00:14:29,094
looks like a nail, but not.

246
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:32,014
It's not like this in this, in this world.

247
00:14:32,274 --> 00:14:36,254
We need to understand the complexity
of the world and we need to understand

248
00:14:36,254 --> 00:14:42,154
how important it is to, draw knowledge
from, from different models and different

249
00:14:42,204 --> 00:14:43,754
perspectives and different fields.

250
00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:48,074
In an example, and actually the
first mental model that I would

251
00:14:48,074 --> 00:14:53,014
like us to discuss today is the
Swiss army knife approach, which is

252
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:55,944
Charlie Munger's way of thinking,
Charlie Munger's way of thinking.

253
00:14:56,634 --> 00:15:00,354
Basically, he believed in having
wide, a wide range of mental models,

254
00:15:00,364 --> 00:15:01,644
similar to having many tools.

255
00:15:02,254 --> 00:15:03,414
as we have in a Swiss army knife.

256
00:15:03,414 --> 00:15:07,714
And these metal models, of course,
come from different fields, from

257
00:15:07,714 --> 00:15:12,084
different perspectives, and they
help us see challenges from different

258
00:15:12,664 --> 00:15:17,224
approaches, approach them from different
angles, to find the best solutions.

259
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:24,054
And if we think, if we go into a forest,
with a botanist, real estate agent and

260
00:15:24,054 --> 00:15:28,099
a yoga trainer, of course, each of them
is going to see a different perspective.

261
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,429
Maybe the audience is going to
be marveled by the nature, right?

262
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:31,269
Exactly.

263
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:36,009
How about details from the nature and,
appreciate it and think about how we

264
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:41,049
can, we need to keep this as untouched
by human, action as possible and so on.

265
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:44,589
A real estate agent may be thinking more
from the perspective of a business, right?

266
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:50,499
How he could sell this, how, this could
be a very good place for having a, a

267
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,439
building, a neighborhood and so on.

268
00:15:52,914 --> 00:15:56,024
Then the yoga trainer might be thinking
about the energy and what is happening

269
00:15:56,024 --> 00:15:59,354
in their house session would be so useful
to have in there and to really let our

270
00:15:59,614 --> 00:16:04,244
bodies and mind to use the energy from
there in order to have a great experience.

271
00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:08,274
Each of these perspectives captures
a part, but not the whole picture.

272
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:13,124
And if we rely on a specific
discipline, we develop gaps.

273
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:16,189
Yeah, those blind spots
that we were talking about.

274
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:19,319
You can add up, of course,
there is a confirmation bias,

275
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:20,579
which makes things even worse.

276
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:27,499
Next, a mental model that challenges to
look a bit at how we are considering,

277
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:30,749
the materials that we are using or
the way that we are organizing our

278
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:32,309
work is the map is not a territory.

279
00:16:32,739 --> 00:16:36,509
That refers to the idea that
abstractions like, diagrams and

280
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,829
some schemes, that we are doing.

281
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:39,644
Yeah.

282
00:16:40,454 --> 00:16:44,664
or any representation are not
the same as the reality itself.

283
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:49,884
So any model or map that we create
to understand something is a

284
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:53,894
simplification and doesn't capture
every detail of real world system.

285
00:16:53,894 --> 00:16:57,424
And this applies directly to software
development where we work with diagrams,

286
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,874
for example, and requirements and
models that not fully represent the

287
00:17:00,874 --> 00:17:02,954
complexity of the system itself.

288
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:08,329
And we can think, for example, Let's
say we are, a very careful developer,

289
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:14,449
that follows, the project specification,
document closely, but then when

290
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:18,349
testing in production and, having
our solution in the real world, we

291
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:20,109
encounter some unexpected issues, right?

292
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:24,339
So using this model helps us
recognize that the specification.

293
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:27,429
The document, the map, yeah,
it's not the same as the actual

294
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:28,779
running system, the territory.

295
00:17:29,139 --> 00:17:31,789
No matter how detailed the
specification is, it will miss some

296
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,919
real world behaviors or edge cases.

297
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,859
And by acknowledging
this, we remain cautious.

298
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:42,709
We implement retesting, including those
edge cases that we were mentioning,

299
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:46,629
to ensure that the actual software
performs as intended in the real world.

300
00:17:47,129 --> 00:17:52,429
The third mental model that I
want us to touch today, it's

301
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:53,699
the second order thinking.

302
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,479
And I would like to start by

303
00:17:56,979 --> 00:17:59,609
there is this effect,
all the cobra effect.

304
00:17:59,939 --> 00:18:03,089
Basically, the story goes that when
the British colonial government in

305
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:06,819
Delhi wanted to reduce the number
of cobras in the city, they offered

306
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,409
a bounty for every dead cobra.

307
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:12,419
Initially, this seemed like a good
idea, but in time, there were some

308
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:14,849
individuals that realized that
they could breed cobras and they'll

309
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:15,999
kill them for the bounty, right?

310
00:18:16,469 --> 00:18:18,299
And increasing, of course, their profits.

311
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:21,839
This was not a good idea
since the government found

312
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,689
out and stopped the program.

313
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:24,489
Yeah.

314
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:28,239
After discovered this unintended
consequence of, of their program.

315
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:33,309
And in response, the cobra breeders, of
course, having no use for the snakes,

316
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:37,949
they released them causing the cobra
population be even worse than before.

317
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:41,819
So this unintended outcome is
recognized as the cobra effect.

318
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:46,439
And actually this is, if we look
carefully, we see the consequence and

319
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:47,989
the consequence of our decisions in the.

320
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:50,429
consequences of the
consequences of our decisions.

321
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:55,579
And this is exactly what the second order
thinking mental model touches, because it

322
00:18:55,589 --> 00:18:59,549
encourages us to look beyond the immediate
consequences, to understand their long

323
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:02,809
term effects, as well as ripple effects
that might arise from these decisions.

324
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,569
And let's again take an example
in software development.

325
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:11,069
Let's say that we are part of a team that
is being assigned to work with, e commerce

326
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:14,799
platform, And of course, The thing that
we do, we are focusing on delivering the,

327
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,179
the core functionality of the platform.

328
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:19,719
Ensuring that the basic features
like, think first, right?

329
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:24,649
Basic features like product search,
checkout, payment, work smoothly, right?

330
00:19:25,194 --> 00:19:29,154
Maybe we even think about, okay, let's
prioritize performance and speed to give

331
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,614
users a bra, fast browsing experience.

332
00:19:31,614 --> 00:19:33,964
This is the first thing that
we are considering, when

333
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:34,954
we are here in e commerce.

334
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:38,634
Okay, but these are the
first order thinking.

335
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:41,764
This is an example, again,
take it with a grain of salt.

336
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:45,574
But if we go a bit more into
details, we can actually consider

337
00:19:45,594 --> 00:19:46,894
those second order effects.

338
00:19:46,974 --> 00:19:50,824
Yeah, we can start thinking beyond the
immediate functional requirements and

339
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:52,514
think, okay, but what happens if spikes?

340
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,574
if traffic spikes dramatically.

341
00:19:55,074 --> 00:19:55,384
Yeah.

342
00:19:55,914 --> 00:20:00,894
What happens if part of the system fails,
for example, the payment component.

343
00:20:01,394 --> 00:20:05,694
And if I have to add new features,
features to this, will it be easy?

344
00:20:05,694 --> 00:20:08,114
Will it be hard for
the business to evolve?

345
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:08,864
How things will be?

346
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,124
By asking this kind of question.

347
00:20:10,124 --> 00:20:13,754
So going a bit beyond to the
second order concerns, we can

348
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:16,504
see other important factors.

349
00:20:16,934 --> 00:20:20,204
a service like scalability, the
need for availability and fault

350
00:20:20,214 --> 00:20:23,024
tolerance, performance under load,
security and compliance, and so on.

351
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:28,984
this, this mental model helps us
exercise, considering the ripple effects

352
00:20:28,984 --> 00:20:33,394
of our decisions, and help us identify
and prioritize Characteristics that

353
00:20:33,434 --> 00:20:35,504
will ensure long term success, right?

354
00:20:35,564 --> 00:20:39,834
It prevents us from focusing on
short term functional goals and,

355
00:20:40,174 --> 00:20:45,694
helps us handle future challenges and
opportunities with minimal, disruptions.

356
00:20:46,684 --> 00:20:50,264
an interesting part about,
about us, and we are discussing

357
00:20:50,264 --> 00:20:52,264
before, about this when talking.

358
00:20:53,234 --> 00:20:56,294
about blind spots is that we cannot
understand a system that we are a part of.

359
00:20:56,774 --> 00:21:00,544
And relativity involves understanding
that things are not absolute and often

360
00:21:00,544 --> 00:21:01,894
depend on context or perspective.

361
00:21:02,589 --> 00:21:02,809
Yeah.

362
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:07,349
So my all time favorite example or
situation for this is when we have

363
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:11,039
to choose from or technology language
and application for an application.

364
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:13,549
Doesn't matter technology
language approach.

365
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:14,159
Doesn't matter.

366
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:18,789
I remember some years ago, we were
not sure if this dispute since

367
00:21:19,189 --> 00:21:21,259
still is, but there is what is best.

368
00:21:22,229 --> 00:21:23,369
Java, what is best.

369
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:28,739
React or Angular, which is the
best, has the best approach, how

370
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:29,929
we are going to work with it.

371
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:35,349
things like this, like what has the most
advantages, which one is the best, where?

372
00:21:36,139 --> 00:21:38,779
Instead of asking what's the best
programming language, how about, I

373
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:42,729
think, what is the best programming
language for this specific project?

374
00:21:43,229 --> 00:21:45,489
The best language is relative
to the skill set of the team,

375
00:21:45,589 --> 00:21:47,079
projects, requirements, timeframe.

376
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:48,629
There's no absolute best answer.

377
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:51,309
What matters is the context
in which the decision is made.

378
00:21:51,749 --> 00:21:56,069
Then, instead of always striving for
brilliance or perfection, it's often more

379
00:21:56,069 --> 00:21:58,109
effective to focus on avoiding mistakes.

380
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:01,419
In the context of software, for example,
this could mean focusing on common

381
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:03,084
pitfalls and making sure to avoid them.

382
00:22:03,584 --> 00:22:07,854
For example, let's say that you
have a deadline, a very aggressive

383
00:22:07,854 --> 00:22:09,754
deadline, you did not expect this.

384
00:22:09,764 --> 00:22:11,104
Things have changed in the project.

385
00:22:11,104 --> 00:22:14,684
What we are going to do, instead of
thinking, okay, what are the best

386
00:22:14,684 --> 00:22:18,795
practices to follow to meet this deadline,
those, magazines that are then giving you,

387
00:22:18,845 --> 00:22:24,825
10 steps to be the best manager, 10 steps
to be a productive developer, and so on.

388
00:22:25,215 --> 00:22:28,825
Instead of looking for these 10 steps
to ensure that we meet the deadline,

389
00:22:28,855 --> 00:22:31,285
how about we apply inversion, right?

390
00:22:31,545 --> 00:22:34,425
And ask what common mistakes
we need to avoid that could

391
00:22:34,425 --> 00:22:35,565
make us miss the deadline?

392
00:22:36,065 --> 00:22:37,795
What did we do the last time
when we missed the deadline?

393
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:39,005
Let's avoid doing that.

394
00:22:39,345 --> 00:22:40,355
Start from that point.

395
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,660
Then, by deliberately avoiding
these common mistakes, you increase

396
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,780
the chances of success rather than
just looking for the best way to

397
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,990
do it without being validated.

398
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:53,480
You already validated what are the worst,
the worst things that you can do to not

399
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,680
be the deadline for sure in the past.

400
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,930
Start from there.

401
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,010
Focus on ensuring that simple
errors don't derail the project.

402
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:06,190
Then moving forward, you know how we
have this tendency of Thinking that

403
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:09,290
the more complicated something or the
problem that you're facing, or the

404
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:13,165
more complicated the solution that we
are giving you, the more complex, the

405
00:23:13,165 --> 00:23:17,450
more, important we are because we don't
know the same thing as everyone else.

406
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,160
So we end up becoming really good at
something specific just to stand out.

407
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:26,840
And sometimes we actually find or
look for complex, resolutions for

408
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:30,460
our problems just to make sure that
others can easily understand it.

409
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,140
But besides that, to make sure that
we stand out with our complex way of

410
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,000
looking at things, our outcomes raiser.

411
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,220
It's a concept that suggests that
when faced with multiple competing

412
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,680
solutions, the best starting point
is to start with the simplest one.

413
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:50,020
If your project is not, explicitly
asking for the most complex solution,

414
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,310
start with, with the simplest one.

415
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,850
And we have a lot of examples in software.

416
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,770
I'm sure that you've been thinking
about at least three since I

417
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,250
opened the conversation about this.

418
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:04,320
But what I can say to wrap up this is
to avoid overengineering solutions in

419
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:09,850
both development, design, architecture,
design for simplicity and usability

420
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,930
and focus on straightforward solution
during debugging and problem solving.

421
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,320
And, a simple, more focused
approach is easier to use and

422
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,480
it's easier to build upon.

423
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,330
of course, again, take
it with a grain of salt.

424
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,840
Check the context of your.

425
00:24:25,445 --> 00:24:30,985
situation, problem, whatever it
is, and try to build step by step.

426
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:36,610
to see exactly what kind of approach
you need to do, but don't respond out of

427
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,610
ego, which we're mentioning a bit before.

428
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:44,450
Of course, we've touched today
some mental models and there

429
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,390
are a lot of mental models.

430
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:48,740
I actually encourage you to look on
it and see, but it's not about knowing

431
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,650
them, knowing as many as possible.

432
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,070
It's about being open and learning.

433
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:54,260
Yeah.

434
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:55,880
We need to.

435
00:24:56,545 --> 00:25:01,415
move away from solving immediate
tasks and start thinking holistically

436
00:25:01,415 --> 00:25:02,235
about the systems we build.

437
00:25:02,235 --> 00:25:07,335
And these kind of models help us navigate
complexity and make better decisions.

438
00:25:07,845 --> 00:25:13,075
And they allow us to design software that
does not only solve current problems, but

439
00:25:13,215 --> 00:25:15,515
is adaptable for future growth and change.

440
00:25:15,895 --> 00:25:18,365
So I'm going to leave you
with this beautiful code from

441
00:25:18,415 --> 00:25:21,245
Alexander, which I think it's the
essence of a developer's mindset.

442
00:25:21,295 --> 00:25:24,485
When you build a thing, you cannot
merely build that thing in isolation.

443
00:25:24,485 --> 00:25:26,085
You must repair the world around it.

444
00:25:27,465 --> 00:25:30,245
understanding that every piece of
software contributes to a larger system.

445
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:34,015
So just to close the
circle, build castles.

446
00:25:34,015 --> 00:25:35,135
Don't just break castles.

447
00:25:35,135 --> 00:25:36,295
Don't just break stones.

448
00:25:36,755 --> 00:25:38,715
Think about your, your
work from this perspective.

449
00:25:39,355 --> 00:25:42,835
I want to very much for staying with
me today and for listening to my talk.

450
00:25:42,885 --> 00:25:45,975
I hope that I was able to.

451
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:49,805
to open some question for you or
some areas that you would like

452
00:25:49,805 --> 00:25:53,515
to explore further and yeah,
reach out and let's discuss.

453
00:25:54,065 --> 00:25:54,865
Thank you very much.
