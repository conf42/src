00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,489
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,500
This is Ma Car Busa.

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:08,420
I am a BN data specialist
with 18 years of experience.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,190
Today I want to talk about something
every company struggles with.

5
00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:18,650
How do we let people use data
easily while still keeping everyone,

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,030
everything, everything's secure.

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,955
We are living in a world
where data is everywhere.

8
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:27,085
And everyone want answers fast.

9
00:00:27,535 --> 00:00:32,295
So let's walk through how self-serve
BI and DevSecOps can work together

10
00:00:32,295 --> 00:00:34,275
in a simple practical way.

11
00:00:34,775 --> 00:00:36,575
So here's our plan for today.

12
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:41,495
The huge growth of data, why
self-serve BI is becoming essential,

13
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:47,855
why security must be built into
everything, how AI is changing analytics

14
00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:49,865
with some real time examples and.

15
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:52,805
Simple roadmap you can follow.

16
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:54,335
Let's get into it.

17
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:57,865
We are surrounded by more
data than ever before.

18
00:00:58,135 --> 00:01:01,315
The world is hitting 1
75 terabytes of data.

19
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:02,965
That's a number.

20
00:01:02,965 --> 00:01:04,164
So huge.

21
00:01:04,254 --> 00:01:07,005
It's almost silly, but here's the problem.

22
00:01:07,505 --> 00:01:11,315
Even though we have all this
data, companies still struggles

23
00:01:11,315 --> 00:01:13,505
to answer simple questions.

24
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:14,585
Why?

25
00:01:15,515 --> 00:01:16,565
Too much data?

26
00:01:17,195 --> 00:01:18,635
Too many systems.

27
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:23,495
Reports take too long, and
everything is struck in silos.

28
00:01:24,425 --> 00:01:26,815
So the business waits and waits.

29
00:01:27,415 --> 00:01:29,395
This is where self-serve BI comes in.

30
00:01:29,895 --> 00:01:35,324
Self-serve BI is simple, lets people get
their own answers without waiting for it.

31
00:01:35,824 --> 00:01:40,654
Imagine if marketing,
hr, finance, operations.

32
00:01:41,014 --> 00:01:44,494
Everyone could open a dashboard
and get insights instantly.

33
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,174
It saves time.

34
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:47,945
It speeds up decisions.

35
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:52,654
It removes body lengths, and instead
of waiting a week for a port,

36
00:01:52,684 --> 00:01:54,515
people get answers in minutes.

37
00:01:54,874 --> 00:01:56,404
That's the power of self serve.

38
00:01:56,905 --> 00:01:58,255
But here's the catch.

39
00:01:58,675 --> 00:02:03,265
When you give more people access
to data, you must also be careful.

40
00:02:03,805 --> 00:02:05,815
That's where DevSecOps comes in.

41
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:12,400
It basically means build security
into every step from development

42
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,830
to deployment to daily operations.

43
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,580
Don't think about security at the end.

44
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,680
Think about it from the beginning,
just like you put on a seatbelt

45
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,630
before driving, not after.

46
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,200
This slide is important because
studies show 70% of BI projects fail.

47
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,950
Not because the technology is bad, but
because there is no governance, people

48
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:43,100
aren't trained, access is too open and
too restricted, or the system is too

49
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:50,900
complicated, so only 30% succeed, and they
do so because they balance two things.

50
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,390
Security and easy access.

51
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,260
Not too tight, not too loose, just right.

52
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,644
Ai, AI has changed the game completely.

53
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:04,005
Now, you don't need to write code our sql.

54
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:09,015
You can simply ask the system,
show me this month revenue.

55
00:03:10,005 --> 00:03:12,704
What are the top reasons
for customer churn?

56
00:03:13,665 --> 00:03:14,864
And the system answers.

57
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:20,054
AI can find patterns, predict
outcomes, and guide users.

58
00:03:21,015 --> 00:03:22,695
It's like having a mini data analytic.

59
00:03:23,195 --> 00:03:25,085
Analyst sitting on your shoulder.

60
00:03:25,595 --> 00:03:30,935
But again, the more powerful the
tool, the more important the security.

61
00:03:31,434 --> 00:03:33,084
This is the perfect mix.

62
00:03:33,144 --> 00:03:38,545
Faster insights, more accurate
predictions, strong security,

63
00:03:38,754 --> 00:03:40,644
working quietly in the background.

64
00:03:41,144 --> 00:03:43,965
Users shouldn't have to fight the system.

65
00:03:44,174 --> 00:03:48,135
The security shouldn't show
slow down and business.

66
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:51,784
When done right, you get
speed and safety together.

67
00:03:52,284 --> 00:03:53,604
Here's a simple example.

68
00:03:53,964 --> 00:03:59,964
A marketing team used AI powered BI to
check how their campaign campaigns were

69
00:03:59,964 --> 00:04:03,534
performing before reports took hours.

70
00:04:04,134 --> 00:04:10,824
After insights came in minutes, they
cut costs improved ROI and still

71
00:04:10,824 --> 00:04:13,614
stayed compliant with privacy loss.

72
00:04:14,124 --> 00:04:14,639
That's the goal.

73
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:17,379
Fast answers with zero risk.

74
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,490
One more example this time from hr, A
company used predictive analytics to

75
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,040
understand which employees might leave.

76
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,890
Not to punish everyone,
but to offer help early.

77
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,110
This only worked because
sensitive data has protected.

78
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,810
Only HR could see the details.

79
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,880
Every access was audited.

80
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,640
This is responsible analytics.

81
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:51,020
Good security starts with simple
things, give people access only what

82
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,960
they need, hide sensitive data for
people who shouldn't see it, and use

83
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,330
multiple multifactor authentication.

84
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,150
Make sure sessions automatically time out.

85
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:08,260
These control prevent, prevents accidental
mistakes and protect the organization.

86
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,170
Lineage is basically the story
of your data, where it come from,

87
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,410
what transforms happened, who
touched it, how it be being used.

88
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,660
This builds trust.

89
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,100
When leaders ask, where
did this number came from?

90
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,890
You have the answer, right?

91
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,410
It also keeps auditors happy.

92
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,620
Tools don't create success.

93
00:05:33,355 --> 00:05:37,675
People do to make BI and security work.

94
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:39,505
Leaders must support it.

95
00:05:40,165 --> 00:05:41,815
Users must be trained.

96
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:46,345
Policies must be clear and
continuous improvements must

97
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:52,585
happen when people understand the
why they follow them, and how out

98
00:05:53,085 --> 00:05:56,265
here is an easy roadmap,
access your current state.

99
00:05:56,765 --> 00:06:00,245
What data do you have and what gaps exist?

100
00:06:00,815 --> 00:06:04,445
So design your architecture, build
the security and automation in mind,

101
00:06:05,315 --> 00:06:10,385
and how do we enable users, train
them, support them, make tools simple.

102
00:06:11,225 --> 00:06:15,215
And finally, monitor and option optimize.

103
00:06:15,305 --> 00:06:20,335
So improve based on usage and
feedback and security needs.

104
00:06:20,635 --> 00:06:24,535
This roadmap works for small teams
and large enterprises as well.

105
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:29,535
And finally the key takeaways,
let's, let me summarize the

106
00:06:29,535 --> 00:06:31,485
whole talk in four points.

107
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:36,135
Security and accessibility should
work together, not against each other.

108
00:06:36,635 --> 00:06:39,094
AI is speeding up analytics tremendously.

109
00:06:39,995 --> 00:06:46,655
Culture matters more than tools and
DevSecOps ensures BI is scalable and safe.

110
00:06:47,284 --> 00:06:50,455
If we get this right, we build a truly.

111
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,330
Data driven organization.

112
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,850
Thanks for thanks everyone for listening.

113
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:01,160
I'm happy to answer any questions and
talk through any of the challenges

114
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,150
that you're facing right now with
the within BI and data space.

115
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,400
You guys can reach out to me in LinkedIn.

116
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,260
Thank you.
