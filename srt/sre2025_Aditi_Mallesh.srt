00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,870
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,730
This is ATI ish.

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,130
Thank you for joining my session.

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,030
Today.

5
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:12,360
We'll be discussing on zero to 50
engineering sub 50 millisecond.

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,020
I am architecture for high
stake gaming platform.

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,470
In the competitive world of online
gaming and betting every millisecond of

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:27,560
authentication latency directly impacts
user experience, revenue, and security.

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,650
Let's discuss on an innovative identity
and access management architecture

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,600
that consistently achieves sub 50
millisecond authentication speed

11
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,060
across global markets at scale.

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,950
This presentation reveals
the engineering decisions.

13
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:49,669
Implementation details and measurable
results for a high performance IAM

14
00:00:49,669 --> 00:00:54,769
system providing actionable insights
for technology leaders seeking

15
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:58,939
millisecond level responsiveness
in today's gaming landscape.

16
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:04,089
Let's start with discussing on the
business impact of authentication Speed.

17
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,479
Our data shows the direct
correlation between authentication

18
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,249
speed and business success.

19
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:16,829
When authentication time exceed
a hundred millisecond transaction

20
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:18,989
completion rate drop dramatically.

21
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:24,859
Players expect instantaneous responses,
especially during time sensitive

22
00:01:24,949 --> 00:01:26,989
gaming or betting opportunities.

23
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:32,749
By optimizing authentication, we
have seen significant improvements

24
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:34,909
across key performance metrics.

25
00:01:35,419 --> 00:01:35,929
Our data indicates.

26
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:43,599
18% reduction in transaction abandonment
with 27% increase in user retention

27
00:01:43,989 --> 00:01:47,559
leading to 32% rise in revenue growth.

28
00:01:48,059 --> 00:01:51,629
Let's discuss on the global
authentication architecture.

29
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:57,649
The proposed architecture leverages
strategically position edge, deployed

30
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:03,589
identity proxies that dramatically
reduce latency while simultaneously

31
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:09,309
lowering infrastructure costs by
bringing authentication closer to users.

32
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:14,369
We have cut network transmission
time by an average of 65

33
00:02:14,369 --> 00:02:16,649
millisecond across global markets.

34
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:20,929
We used stateless JWT
authentication system.

35
00:02:21,429 --> 00:02:29,829
Our system leveraged Shortlived JWTs with
ES 2 56 cryptographic signing to process

36
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:32,289
thousands of transaction per second.

37
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:38,359
With zero database lookups, maintaining
robust security without sacrificing speed.

38
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:43,839
This stateless approach eliminates
database bottlenecks while allowing

39
00:02:43,929 --> 00:02:48,129
instant revocation through a
distributed block list when necessary.

40
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:52,104
We also implemented real
time fraud detection.

41
00:02:52,604 --> 00:02:59,234
Our system analyzes behavioral pattern
through streaming technologies to identify

42
00:02:59,324 --> 00:03:02,384
suspicious activities before transactions.

43
00:03:02,384 --> 00:03:07,174
Complete by continuously monitoring,
interaction patterns, device

44
00:03:07,174 --> 00:03:09,694
fingerprints, and transaction velocity.

45
00:03:10,084 --> 00:03:13,984
We can detect anomalies
without adding authentication

46
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:16,234
latency for legitimate users.

47
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:22,254
We also utilized intelligent
KYC and compliance metrics by

48
00:03:22,254 --> 00:03:26,664
intelligently offloading KYC
and trust scoring processes.

49
00:03:26,994 --> 00:03:32,154
We have eliminated authentication
bottlenecks while improving regulatory

50
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:34,854
compliance across diverse markets.

51
00:03:35,354 --> 00:03:39,974
Our system adapts verification
requirements based on jurisdiction,

52
00:03:40,574 --> 00:03:46,814
player behavior, and transaction patterns,
applying appropriate compliance measures

53
00:03:47,084 --> 00:03:49,484
without impacting authentication speed.

54
00:03:49,984 --> 00:03:55,684
Our system integrated web
authentication, and FID O2 integration.

55
00:03:56,184 --> 00:04:02,754
Our integration of these standards reduced
login friction resulting in measurable

56
00:04:02,754 --> 00:04:08,634
increase in microtransaction conversion
rates among high value player segments.

57
00:04:09,134 --> 00:04:14,744
By leveraging device-based biometric
authentication, we have eliminated

58
00:04:14,924 --> 00:04:19,994
password related friction while
substantially improving security posture.

59
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:24,874
Players can seamlessly authenticate
across devices using fingerprints,

60
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:30,364
facial recognition, or security
keys, reducing the cognitive load of

61
00:04:30,364 --> 00:04:35,344
remembering credentials while making
account takeovers virtually impossible.

62
00:04:35,844 --> 00:04:38,649
Some of the performance
benchmarks from our study.

63
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:45,099
We have conducted comprehensive benchmarks
comparing traditional IM approach

64
00:04:45,429 --> 00:04:50,049
against our optimized architecture
across various gaming scenarios.

65
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:55,590
The results consistently show
our system outperforming industry

66
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,780
standards by three to seven times.

67
00:04:58,275 --> 00:05:04,635
With our edge based JWT authentication,
delivering 32 millisecond

68
00:05:04,664 --> 00:05:06,885
average response time globally,

69
00:05:07,385 --> 00:05:11,044
some of the implementation challenges
and the solutions we followed

70
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:16,614
our journey to sub 50 millisecond
authentication wasn't without obstacles.

71
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:22,409
By addressing the core challenges with
innovative solutions, we have created

72
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:28,469
a system that balances speed, security,
and compliance without compromise.

73
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:33,909
Some of the challenges were JWTs
can't be immediately revoked.

74
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:39,599
The solution we found was a short five
minute lifetime with silent background

75
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:44,699
refresh, combined with distributed
revocation list for compromised tokens.

76
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,299
Another challenge was maintaining
consistent auth policy across regions.

77
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:56,469
To overcome that, we had to use
centralized policy management with atomic

78
00:05:56,709 --> 00:06:01,719
version updates propagated to edge news
through resilient messaging system.

79
00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:03,809
Our next challenge was.

80
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,639
The varying KYC requirement
across jurisdictions.

81
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:13,449
To overcome that, we had to deploy region
specific compliance module with local

82
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:19,229
data residency where required, separated
from core authentication, workflow,

83
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:22,185
some of the business
outcomes and the impact.

84
00:06:22,955 --> 00:06:27,005
The impact of this authentication
improvement extends far

85
00:06:27,005 --> 00:06:28,535
beyond technical metrics.

86
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:34,235
Players experience a seamless,
frictionless environment that encourages

87
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:39,455
engagement and builds trust while the
business benefits from higher conversion

88
00:06:39,455 --> 00:06:41,880
rate and op operational efficiency,

89
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,095
some of the metrics is present.

90
00:06:45,065 --> 00:06:51,905
We did see 92% reduction in authentication
related support tickets, 4.8 out of

91
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:59,025
five average rating, which was up
from 3.6 for operational efficiency.

92
00:06:59,325 --> 00:07:05,235
43% of infrastructural cost was
reduced, and 72% of peak time

93
00:07:05,235 --> 00:07:06,765
scaling events were reduced.

94
00:07:07,265 --> 00:07:12,905
For security improvements, we saw
67% reduction in account takeover

95
00:07:12,935 --> 00:07:18,395
attempts, and 98% decrease in
successful credential staffing attacks.

96
00:07:18,895 --> 00:07:24,445
Thus, the revenue growth saw 16%
increase in average transaction value

97
00:07:24,805 --> 00:07:29,605
and 24% higher conversion on time
sensitive betting opportunities.

98
00:07:30,105 --> 00:07:34,235
The implementation roadmap and
recommendation begin your journey

99
00:07:34,235 --> 00:07:37,865
to millisecond level authentication
with this faced approach.

100
00:07:38,855 --> 00:07:43,745
We recommend starting with a pilot
in your highest value region to

101
00:07:43,745 --> 00:07:48,065
demonstrate immediate business
impact before expanding globally.

102
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:53,970
Focus first on core authentication speed
before implementing advanced feature

103
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,910
like biometrics and behavioral analysis.

104
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,580
I look forward to discuss further
on our approach and to answer

105
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,020
any questions that you have.

106
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,620
Hope this gave some idea on.

107
00:08:07,145 --> 00:08:12,035
How to seek millisecond level response
time and how to build an architecture.

108
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:14,035
Thank you for joining my session.

109
00:08:14,845 --> 00:08:17,005
Hope you enjoy the rest of the conference.
