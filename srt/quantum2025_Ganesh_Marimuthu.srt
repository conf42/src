00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,280
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,880
Good morning, good
afternoon, good evening.

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:07,979
From part of the world.

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,629
You are listening to this presentation.

5
00:00:11,499 --> 00:00:16,239
It's a privilege to speak to you today on
a subject that sits at the intersection

6
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:21,575
of cutting edge physics, advanced
computing, and the fast world of.

7
00:00:22,075 --> 00:00:27,415
As we know, today's financial markets
are already driven by ultra low latency

8
00:00:27,415 --> 00:00:32,155
trading strategies, massive data
analytics, sophisticated algorithms,

9
00:00:32,785 --> 00:00:38,775
but as computing approaches the physical
and performance limits, we are standing

10
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:42,584
on the edge of a new technological
frontier with quantum computing.

11
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:48,484
Quantum computing isn't just another
leaking speed or storage, it's completely

12
00:00:48,544 --> 00:00:50,914
re-imagining of how computation works.

13
00:00:51,724 --> 00:00:56,644
By leveraging principles like super
position entanglement, quantum

14
00:00:56,644 --> 00:01:01,785
computers are capable of solving
certain complex problems exponentially

15
00:01:01,785 --> 00:01:03,315
faster than classical machines.

16
00:01:03,915 --> 00:01:05,685
And this capability opens up.

17
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:11,045
Imagine a real time portfolio optimization
across thousands of correlated assets.

18
00:01:11,554 --> 00:01:17,045
Imagine risk simulation that wants
to co reduced to milliseconds.

19
00:01:17,405 --> 00:01:21,335
Imagine a trading system that
doesn't just react faster, but can

20
00:01:21,425 --> 00:01:26,514
process and astronomically large
decision space, evaluating market

21
00:01:26,514 --> 00:01:31,384
signals, counterparty behavior,
and regulatory impact nevertheless

22
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:33,570
simultaneously and in real time.

23
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,630
While the potential is vast, the
challenge are equally significant

24
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:43,740
from hardware limitations to algorithm
development and critically integration

25
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,750
into today's market infrastructure.

26
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,610
In this presentation, we'll explore
how quantum computing is being

27
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,679
harnessed in trading where the
real computational advantages lie.

28
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:58,799
Quantum accelerated financial
future might actually look like.

29
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,689
As you all know, these days,
this isn't fiction anymore.

30
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:09,634

00:02:38,435 --> 00:02:43,465
I built a reputation for managing,
designing, and optimizing advanced

39
00:02:43,855 --> 00:02:48,924
technology infrastructures that
support business operations in the

40
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,720
capital markets and financial services.

41
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,544
I have a deep understanding of the
fixed income trading platforms and

42
00:02:55,544 --> 00:02:59,624

46
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:20,394
Trading algorithms, market making
strategies, risk adjusted grad

47
00:03:20,604 --> 00:03:24,324
strategies that have significantly
improved execution and efficiency.

48
00:03:24,824 --> 00:03:30,244
With that understanding of execution
venues, liquidity management, I have

49
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:36,024
worked to find tune algorithmic strategies
that optimize slippage, reduce trading

50
00:03:36,024 --> 00:03:37,914

51
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:41,524
I have a diverse range of financial
experience in financial products

52
00:03:41,524 --> 00:03:45,904
such as US Treasury, swaps, credit
equities, and OT OTC database.

53
00:03:46,404 --> 00:03:48,625
That's a short summary about me.

54
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:52,774
Now let's deep dive into the
quantum accelerated trading systems,

55
00:03:53,104 --> 00:03:56,315
which is revolutionizing financial
markets through computational.

56
00:03:56,815 --> 00:04:01,600
Unprecedented volume of data leading
exchanges generating three 42

57
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,775
billion market data messages daily.

58
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:08,555
That's an incredible and
amount of data that we process.

59
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:12,035
Additional computing, architecture,
fundamental limitations, and

60
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:13,500
processing this efficiently.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,370
Research how quantum computing A
are transforming H infrastructure,

62
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,400
offering significant
computational stake environment.

63
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,530
On the next slide, quantum
FinTech over recognition of

64
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,619
quantum computing transformative
potential in trading systems.

65
00:04:32,369 --> 00:04:38,519
The significant improvements in both
processing speed and resource efficiency

66
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:43,139
demonstrate why leading firms are
rapidly adopting these technologies.

67
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:47,139
94% on the leadership recognition,
financial technology leaders

68
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:51,489
identify quantum advantage critical
for the next generation systems.

69
00:04:51,989 --> 00:04:56,210
Calculation speed reduction in
complex calculation time compare

70
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,740
to the classical approaches.

71
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:03,080
78% of calculation speed
that has been reduced.

72
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:12,380
So things which used to take let's say one
hour, about 80% have been reduced in doing

73
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,359
the calculation for the high frequency.

74
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:19,289
67% of the resource efficiencies
decrease in the computational resource

75
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:22,139
requirements while implementing
quantum inspired algorithms

76
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,749
crossing capabilities.

77
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,004
The in parameter crossing capabilities
translates directly to competitive

78
00:05:29,504 --> 00:05:31,844
in algorithmic trading models.

79
00:05:32,354 --> 00:05:35,054
Sophistication drives profitability.

80
00:05:35,554 --> 00:05:37,024
Quantum enhanced systems.

81
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:41,854
Systems leveraging quantum technique
demonstrated that they can process

82
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:46,774
optimization problems with 300 half
times more parameters while maintaining

83
00:05:46,774 --> 00:05:48,274
sub millisecond response times.

84
00:05:48,774 --> 00:05:52,254
This expanded parameter space enables
more sophisticated rating models

85
00:05:52,344 --> 00:05:55,854
that can incorporate a wider range
of market factors and signals.

86
00:05:55,884 --> 00:06:00,884
Simultaneously, traditional computing
approaches manages only 1.4.

87
00:06:01,384 --> 00:06:04,234
Parameter capacity under
the same latency conditions.

88
00:06:05,044 --> 00:06:07,384
Significantly limiting complexity.

89
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:11,194
These systems struggle to incorporate
the full range of relevant market

90
00:06:11,194 --> 00:06:16,344
variables leading to less optimized
rating based on incomplete information.

91
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:20,084
The response times, as you see
in the chart, quantum enhanced

92
00:06:20,504 --> 00:06:22,814
the in high frequency trading.

93
00:06:22,844 --> 00:06:24,949
That nanoseconds can
become a profit or loss.

94
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:32,629
This advantage represents a revolutionary
leap forward in execution capabilities.

95
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:38,849
The integration of quantum algorithms
with acceleration has enabled superior

96
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:41,609
pattern recognition capabilities
and trading systems that this

97
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,189
technological combination allows for.

98
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:48,669
Industry average of about 1 45 microsecond

99
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:50,879
machine learning performance improvements.

100
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:57,509
These enhanced models can identify complex
market patterns, invisible to classical

101
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:02,484
algorithms enabling more precise entry and
accurate in volatile market conditions.

102
00:07:02,984 --> 00:07:07,039
Quantum machine learning techniques have
demonstrated remarkable improvements.

103
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:11,799
Accuracy while maintaining the
stringent latency requirements.

104
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:15,009
Essential for high frequency
trading application.

105
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:21,329
The 41% reduction in
forecasting as you see in the.

106
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:25,779
Requirements, SUBSECOND
processing prediction accuracy,

107
00:07:25,869 --> 00:07:27,759
41% reduction in error rates.

108
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,699
This is one interesting case
study implementation of a

109
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:31,989
three year one trading firms.

110
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:36,129
This case study followed three
trading forms through their complete

111
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:40,359
implementation journey, each organization
followed a similar process assessment

112
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:44,429
for our process of assessment,
development, integration, and evaluation

113
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:46,739
with performance improvements of.

114
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:51,049
Initial assessment, basically
identification of comput, computational

115
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:55,399
bottlenecks and existing trading
infrastructure, algorithm development,

116
00:07:55,729 --> 00:08:01,009
creation of quantum inspired
optimization algorithms, tailored for

117
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:05,799
portfolio management, infrastructure
integration, deployment of hybrid

118
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:08,259
quantum classical computing architecture.

119
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:12,189
And finally, the performance evaluation
measurement of about like 80% of

120
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:15,879
reduction in calculation time across
the complex trading operations.

121
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:18,329
Classical hybrid framework.

122
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,799
This architecture has been validated
across multiple asset classes,

123
00:08:23,549 --> 00:08:30,529
consistently delivering 99.9% execution
reliability, while enabling implementation

124
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:31,879
of advanced trading strategies.

125
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,169
Quantum classical hybrid
framework leverages the strength

126
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:37,234
of each computational paradigm.

127
00:08:37,989 --> 00:08:40,389
Classical systems handle high volume data.

128
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:45,809
Quantum processors tackle complex
optimization problems and the hardware.

129
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:50,899
The F hardware provides a deterministic
execution with minimal la, the data ion

00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:56,059
high throughput market data processing
via classical systems, ultra low latency.

131
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,479
Complex calculations offloaded to
quantum processors and the hardware level

132
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:06,209
implementation of optimized algorithm,
competitive implementation, timeline

133
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:08,899
advantage, classical computing approach.

134
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,309
The implementation of timeline
advantage represents perhaps most

135
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:15,949
significant competitive edge for early.

136
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:21,069
To market advantage translates
directly to capturing trading

137
00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:23,229
opportunities before competitors.

138
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:27,899
This first more advantage is
particularly valuable in emerging

139
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:31,319
market situation and during the periods
of heightened volatility where the.

140
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:38,334
Heavy duty of sell and volatility in
the dealer to dealer platform or dealer

141
00:09:38,334 --> 00:09:42,135
to client platform market happens then.

142
00:09:42,135 --> 00:09:45,455
Market is huge classical
computing approach.

143
00:09:45,455 --> 00:09:48,605
The traditional implementation
pathways require extensive development

144
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:49,835
cycles for new trading strategies.

145
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:54,355
The complex risk models and
optimization proteins can take months

146
00:09:54,355 --> 00:09:57,385
to develop, test, and deploy using
conventional computing resources.

147
00:09:58,345 --> 00:10:02,485
But the quantum enhanced approach
firms utilizing the Quantum Enhanced

148
00:10:03,055 --> 00:10:07,375
Computing frameworks can implement
advanced strategies, which is

149
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,324
three enough times faster than the.

150
00:10:09,824 --> 00:10:15,015
Acceler from both computational speed
and superior parameter optimization.

151
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:20,444
This self-explanatory if you look at
it at the equities fixed income, the

152
00:10:20,474 --> 00:10:26,894
multi-asset performance analysis, latency
improvement, equities, person percent.

153
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:32,889
This is one area where the error reduction
can we have a lot of opportunity to

154
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:38,584
reduce to 50% latency improvement
is 80%, 75%, and the parameter

155
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:42,154
capacity is 3% for foreign exchange.

156
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:43,654
Amazing.

157
00:10:43,704 --> 00:10:48,799
Return of investment for relatedly

160
00:10:54,799 --> 00:11:02,349
times parameter capacity and error
reduction of 39% derivatives over 88%.

161
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:06,159
Latency improvement, 90% of latency
improvement can be achieved.

162
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:10,719
3.5% five times parameter
capacity, and 47% error reduction.

163
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,769
Equities and effect markets also
showed remarkable improvements,

164
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:17,649
particularly in latency reduction
and error rate minimization.

165
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:21,899
Our research validated the quantum
classical hybrids framework across

166
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:25,709
all major asset classes while
performance improvements based.

167
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:29,660
Most significant gains were observed
in derivative ratings where the

168
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,949
complex mathematical models benefit
most from quantum optimization.

169
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:40,110
Now the interesting topic challenges
now that we have spoken extensively

170
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,350
on the advantages of quantum
max related ratings, what are.

171
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:48,880
Second system reliability, third
incorporation complexity, and

172
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,680
fourth regulatory considerations.

173
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,210
Let's go through one by one.

174
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,140
The limited pool of professionals,
even both quantum computing

175
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,310
and financial markets.

176
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,040
Remember even get somebody with a
heavy duty map, knowledge heavy.

177
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,330
Comprehend the financial
markets presents a significant

178
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,470
barrier to the implementation.

179
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:12,070
Forward we identify for quantum computing
has to have extensive knowledge in

180
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:17,285
both finance and the technology leading
firms are addressing this through

181
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:20,460
specialized training programs and
partnership with academic institutions.

182
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,055
System reliability, early quantum
processes have higher error

183
00:12:24,055 --> 00:12:25,555
rates than classical systems.

184
00:12:25,915 --> 00:12:29,785
Hybrid architectures mitigate this by
implementing error correction protocols

185
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:35,725
and verification methods that ensure
99% execution, reliability, integration

186
00:12:35,725 --> 00:12:41,515
complex systems with the quantum computing
systems connecting quantum processing.

187
00:12:42,015 --> 00:12:44,295
And APIs that heal trading systems.

188
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:47,475
From the complexities of
quantum operation, why

189
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:49,065
maintaining the performance?

190
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:52,185
Finally, the regulatory and
compliance considerations.

191
00:12:53,055 --> 00:12:55,965
Financial regulators are still
developing frameworks for

192
00:12:55,965 --> 00:12:57,500
quantum enhanced trading systems.

193
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,930
Forward thinking firms are proactively
engaging with regulatory bodies to

194
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,590
establish operational standards.

195
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:10,440
So extensive analysis and research
are being carried out on the trade

196
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,580
surveillance and the spoofing related
activities, which is very closely

197
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,560
tried with the trading systems,

198
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,100
future outlook and
strategic recommendations.

199
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,580
The quantum revolution in.

200
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,450
They begin with targeted applications.

201
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:30,780
So developing a hybrid architecture
and preparing for a quantum

202
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:35,050
advantages advantage scaling
begins with a targeted application.

203
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,490
Start by for any future outlook, right?

204
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,950
Start by applying quantum
enhanced algorithms, specific

205
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,450
computational bottleneck.

206
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,760
Portfolio optimization in US treasury
rate rating rather than completely

207
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,500
expanding the scope across all the
rates, commodities red, but rather

208
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:54,310
narrow down to one particular segment
under the fixed income portfolio under

209
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:58,440
US treasuries, let's say focus only
on the keynotes or some level of US

210
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,480
treasuries and pricing applications that.

211
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,880
Built internal capabilities in quantum
classical hybrid system design.

212
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,350
The most successful implementation.

213
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:10,680
We leverage both paradigms using
quantum processes for optimization

214
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,830
problems while maintaining classical
systems for deterministic operation.

215
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:18,530
Preparing for quantum advantage
is scaling as quantum hardware

216
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,525
matures over the next three to five
years, prepare varying systems to.

217
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:26,945
Now we'll be positioned to rapidly fund
capabilities as the technology evolves.

218
00:14:27,445 --> 00:14:34,015
Quantum revolution in, like I said, the
financial world is no longer a theory.

219
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:35,275
It's happening.

220
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:40,190
And several firms, the firms
which I am working are trying to.

221
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,380
Organizations that embrace quantum
enhanced trading systems that today will

222
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:49,105
establish competitive advantages that
will be difficult to fall to overcome

223
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:51,140
at the end of time Implementation.

224
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,540
Speed advantage compounds over time,
creating an expanding capability

225
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,195
gap between leaders and followers.

226
00:14:57,695 --> 00:14:59,610
And that comes to the.

227
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,990
This presentation science.
