1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,930
Hello everybody, I'm Rena.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,680
Good morning and hope you're
having a wonderful day.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:13,950
And today we are going to talk about AI
driven rate limiting for resilient and

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,070
cost efficient cloud API production.

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,799
Wow, that's a mouthful, isn't it?

6
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,770
And it sounds incredibly technical.

7
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:25,845
Let me rephrase it to simplify it.

8
00:00:25,845 --> 00:00:31,515
It's all about keeping the dose to our
digital world open for you and other

9
00:00:31,515 --> 00:00:35,115
legitimate users and closed to attackers.

10
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:42,624
Because the truth is we all use API every
single day, whether we realize it or not.

11
00:00:43,434 --> 00:00:45,805
The morning coffee that
you grabbed on your way.

12
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:50,859
To office An API processed the
payment, not the coffee though.

13
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:55,150
The map that you check for
traffic details on your vacation.

14
00:00:55,749 --> 00:00:57,819
The API has delivered that MAP data.

15
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,989
The Taylor Swift or the adult song
that you listen to in your car.

16
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,449
API stream the song to your.

17
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,339
APIs are the invisible
waiters of the tech world.

18
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,460
Taking our request and bringing back what
we asked for, they are the foundation of

19
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,490
modern business and lifestyle convenience.

20
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,509
And here's the problem, the more
important something becomes.

21
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,480
The more valuable it is.

22
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:28,430
Each one of those convenient APIs
is a potential for an attacker.

23
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:34,640
And as a reliance on the APIs has
exploded in the modern world, so has,

24
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,920
it's their appeal to the bad actors.

25
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,700
So the question is never about whether
your firm is going to get attacked.

26
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,960
It's about how well equipped
are you as a company.

27
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,580
To deal with these kind of
attackers when it happens.

28
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:55,140
Are you going to shut down your system
or shut out your estimate users?

29
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:00,210
Which brings me to a story about
a store on earth, a crowded

30
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,905
sales team, a very dumb door.

31
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:03,485
I tell you,

32
00:02:03,985 --> 00:02:05,665
imagine you are a store owner.

33
00:02:06,165 --> 00:02:09,225
Your door is like an API few years ago.

34
00:02:09,915 --> 00:02:13,815
When you started it,
you had a simple rule.

35
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:18,465
Five people allowed entry
in the store per hour.

36
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:24,345
It was easy, but now your
store is the heart of the town.

37
00:02:24,615 --> 00:02:27,705
Your door has, your
door is just not a door.

38
00:02:27,705 --> 00:02:33,655
It's a huge business and everyone
wants to come in and shop and

39
00:02:33,895 --> 00:02:36,355
probably shop listers as well here.

40
00:02:36,385 --> 00:02:38,350
Old rule of five people per hour.

41
00:02:39,145 --> 00:02:40,015
It's a nightmare.

42
00:02:40,015 --> 00:02:45,975
I tell you on the, whenever there
is a sale, as a crowd shows up, your

43
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:51,675
rules is only five allowed at a time,
slamming the door on potential customers.

44
00:02:52,065 --> 00:02:57,945
This leaves the customers who are
frustrated walking and they walk away with

45
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,480
potential and possible repeat business.

46
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,880
And if you leave the door open.

47
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,240
Shoplifters can sneak
in and clean you out.

48
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,190
U Pac Block real users
or let the thieves in.

49
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,060
This is exact dilemma of traditional API.

50
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,030
Production organizations must choose
between aggressive protection that

51
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,550
blocks that could block legitimate
users or lenient policies that

52
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,545
leave systems vulnerable to abuse.

53
00:03:29,045 --> 00:03:34,355
This binary approach results in
significant revenue losses, degradate

54
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:41,435
user experiences and compromised
reliability, but AI and machine learning

55
00:03:41,435 --> 00:03:47,735
presence and opportunity to fundamentally
reimagine API protection through real

56
00:03:47,735 --> 00:03:50,915
time analysis and adaptive mechanisms.

57
00:03:51,415 --> 00:03:51,925
Moving on.

58
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:54,645
Let me tell you about my friend Sarah.

59
00:03:55,545 --> 00:03:58,445
She runs a travel app and
she lived this nightmare.

60
00:03:59,135 --> 00:04:05,315
This travel app, let's say, for the
ease of understanding, has a limit

61
00:04:05,315 --> 00:04:06,215
of five users per hour as well.

62
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:10,725
Practically, it'll be more, but let's keep
it five for the ease of understanding.

63
00:04:11,015 --> 00:04:16,685
It happens that a famous influencer
wrote about this travel app in

64
00:04:16,685 --> 00:04:21,185
her block and the, and suddenly
there are traffic spikes.

65
00:04:21,185 --> 00:04:25,715
Real people excited to book their
next trip, come to her app trying

66
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:28,565
to book, and the app slams the.

67
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,310
For an hour, there is no revenue.

68
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,340
Angry users were probably in
thousands because everybody was

69
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,320
excited right after the article.

70
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,880
This is this tactic
threshold problem estimate.

71
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,290
Traffic from marketing campaigns
doesn't follow predictable patterns.

72
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:51,325
The next day, a bot which is interested
to steal data, comes into the app.

73
00:04:52,015 --> 00:04:56,395
Oh, from probably 10 different, a
hundred different IP addresses and each

74
00:04:56,395 --> 00:05:01,505
slowly trying to hack the system and
they try to ensure that they, these

75
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:06,804
logged in boards stay under the rule
of five per five people per hour rule.

76
00:05:07,315 --> 00:05:08,815
Her system sees nothing wrong.

77
00:05:08,844 --> 00:05:12,445
The boards get in and scrape
all of flight and hotel data.

78
00:05:13,044 --> 00:05:15,955
This is a sophisticated attacker problem.

79
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,130
They distribute attacks across multiple
ips and varying times to stay below the

80
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,250
radar or below the detected thresholds.

81
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,220
The cost, the false positive problem.

82
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,850
When the estimate users are
actually blocked, they may not.

83
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:36,070
Retail requests leading to
a loss transactions and the

84
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:40,085
damaged customer relationships
significantly impacting API driven.

85
00:05:40,945 --> 00:05:41,995
Revenue streams.

86
00:05:42,265 --> 00:05:47,485
And the other problem is when there
is a sophisticated attack by the boats

87
00:05:47,905 --> 00:05:53,605
the, this traditional rate limiting
cannot identify that there is an

88
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:55,915
attack happening at all in first place.

89
00:05:56,365 --> 00:06:00,295
Forget about even mediating
it or responding to that.

90
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:02,175
Returning to a store owner.

91
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:06,365
What if we gave him a genius security
guard instead of a simple rule?

92
00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:12,145
The guard doesn't just count people
he watches how they behave is

93
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:16,344
someone just slowly walking in,
looking at products, probably fine.

94
00:06:16,974 --> 00:06:22,044
He's a group of people certainly shuffling
in all wearing similar clothes and bee

95
00:06:22,044 --> 00:06:24,294
lining to the most expensive items.

96
00:06:24,744 --> 00:06:26,784
Probably a big red flag.

97
00:06:27,384 --> 00:06:31,224
That's what AI does through
behavioral feature analysis.

98
00:06:31,764 --> 00:06:36,354
Instead of just counting requests,
it analyzes dozens of attributes

99
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:41,154
simultaneously, like request timing
patterns, payload characteristics,

100
00:06:41,364 --> 00:06:46,434
geographic distribution, user
agent diversity and response

101
00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:48,204
code sequences, et cetera.

102
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:52,649
Plus, it adds a temporal dimensions,
for example, understanding requests.

103
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:57,609
Sequences, user session patterns and
traffic over evolution over time.

104
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,899
It knows that the EDL users logs in,
looks for something, adds the cart,

105
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:03,909
and probably looks for something else.

106
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:06,429
But what does none of it?

107
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:09,519
It doesn't because it's not
buying, it doesn't put in the cart.

108
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:14,089
And this kind of temporal awareness
enables detection of slow burn

109
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:19,439
attacks, unsophisticated attacks that
might appear benign individually.

110
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,319
Talking about how does it work?

111
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,119
Think about it like this.

112
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:28,079
You don't you don't
hire one security guard.

113
00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:32,099
You hire a committee of many experts.

114
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:37,769
One expert could be a geographic
visit, one could be a timing guru.

115
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,409
One could be all about browsers.

116
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:42,779
One could be about IP addresses.

117
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:48,059
So let's say we just take three of
them into concentration and a request

118
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:49,829
comes in, the committee votes.

119
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:55,469
The geographic guy says it's fine,
but the timing guru and the browser

120
00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:58,080
expert says, nah, dude, that's weird.

121
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,509
The majority rules unblock it.

122
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,594
This committee is what we call.

123
00:08:03,094 --> 00:08:03,905
Decision.

124
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:09,565
Pre ensembles like random forest
and gradient boosting, they excel

125
00:08:09,565 --> 00:08:16,015
in handling mixed data types and are
relatively interpretable and capture

126
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:18,265
complex non-linear relationships.

127
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:19,135
Between features.

128
00:08:19,795 --> 00:08:23,670
Of course, we face training challenges,
estimate traffic, typically far

129
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,890
outnumbers malicious requests.

130
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,100
We address this through
advanced sampling techniques.

131
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:31,875
And cause sensitive learning.

132
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,694
And here's the crucial part.

133
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:36,694
This committee never stops training.

134
00:08:36,755 --> 00:08:40,775
It continuously learns from new
attacks and changes the traffic and

135
00:08:40,775 --> 00:08:45,665
changes traffic patterns through online
learning algorithms and periodic.

136
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,900
Retraining, retraining strategies
periodically retrain strategies

137
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,990
to understand what kind of
attack may happen in future.

138
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,250
This kind of continuous learning
capability is what keeps

139
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,330
the system smart over time.

140
00:08:59,830 --> 00:08:59,950
I.

141
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,540
Back to Sarah's travel app.

142
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:07,300
The influencer writes about her app again
this time with her AI in her system.

143
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,840
Her system sees that there are
traffic spike, but it is also sees

144
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,700
that requests are coming in from.

145
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,760
Different users,
different Instagram users.

146
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,560
People are browsing from different
pages using various devices, and AI

147
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,480
thinks this looks like a happy crowd.

148
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,520
The door stays wide open.

149
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,390
Meanwhile, those sneaky bots come back.

150
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,334
The AI sees they are perfectly
spaced, have DentiCal, so source of.

151
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:40,125
My source from where they come in
analytical software and hit only

152
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:43,334
the login page and they don't do
anything much apart from search.

153
00:09:43,995 --> 00:09:47,834
They, I think this is suspicious,
but instead of slamming the door,

154
00:09:48,735 --> 00:09:51,314
it might just slow them down.

155
00:09:52,214 --> 00:09:56,954
This is progressive throttling,
moving beyond binary decision

156
00:09:57,314 --> 00:09:58,305
to implement increasingly.

157
00:09:58,805 --> 00:10:03,725
Restrictive measures based on
confidence level, subtle delays, rate

158
00:10:03,725 --> 00:10:10,235
deduction, and only fully blocking
for clearly malicious activity.

159
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:15,895
The AI also uses dynamic user
classification, anonymously grouping

160
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:20,485
users in a behavioral cohorts
based on historical patterns.

161
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:26,305
Application users, car application,
usage characteristics, and risk profiles.

162
00:10:26,305 --> 00:10:30,745
Users can move between these kind of
segments from based on the real behavior,

163
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:36,025
earning higher privilege through
legitimate users or facing restrictions

164
00:10:36,025 --> 00:10:38,805
for certain suspicious activities.

165
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,585
Okay, how do we build this?

166
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:45,535
The beauty is the cloud
gives us the perfect tools.

167
00:10:45,595 --> 00:10:49,675
Imagine you need to upgrade security
for your store coming back to the store.

168
00:10:50,635 --> 00:10:55,805
You, even though we did speak about
a smart security guard, but if

169
00:10:55,805 --> 00:11:00,025
you think about it, we cannot use
a single security guard like Hulk

170
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:01,345
who wouldn't be able to multitask.

171
00:11:01,915 --> 00:11:07,525
You need a team, a camera, to monitor
a sec, a fast security guard who

172
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:11,305
runs around, an expert consultant
at the back end who's monitoring

173
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:16,075
things on camera and an intercom to
connect them all to be able to talk.

174
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,195
And it need not be just
one single security card.

175
00:11:19,195 --> 00:11:22,585
It can be multiple, but that's
the whole point, having a team.

176
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:27,195
On AWS we leverage this with Full Stack.

177
00:11:27,255 --> 00:11:33,945
We leverage this full stack with API,
gateway, Lambda, and SageMaker on

178
00:11:33,945 --> 00:11:41,055
Azure, the API management with Azure
Machine Learning on Google Cloud.

179
00:11:41,055 --> 00:11:43,635
It's API gateway with Vertex ai.

180
00:11:43,905 --> 00:11:48,315
Now, what if your store
becomes so successful that

181
00:11:48,315 --> 00:11:49,725
it branches on in different.

182
00:11:50,145 --> 00:11:52,155
Countries, different locations.

183
00:11:52,485 --> 00:11:56,085
You need to be consistent
with your security everywhere.

184
00:11:56,475 --> 00:12:00,315
The challenge is making sure
that the security protocol in one

185
00:12:00,315 --> 00:12:02,805
branch doesn't drift from another.

186
00:12:03,315 --> 00:12:08,235
The solution, you don't let
branch make its own rules.

187
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:11,985
You have one head of
security at headquarters.

188
00:12:12,405 --> 00:12:17,345
Who sends the rule to every
branch and every branch executes

189
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:19,175
it in with their local team.

190
00:12:19,775 --> 00:12:23,885
Multi-cloud strategies provide
additional resilience, but con

191
00:12:23,945 --> 00:12:28,625
introduce complexity in data
synchronization on model consistency.

192
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,665
Container orchestration.

193
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:35,225
Platforms like Kubernetes can
facilitate deployment consistency

194
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:37,955
across different cloud providers.

195
00:12:38,455 --> 00:12:45,865
Now, how does AI actually distinguish less
estimate spikes from attacks in real time?

196
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:50,780
Let's get into real magic with three
specific attacks on Sarah's travel app.

197
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,620
Stopping credential stuffing attackers
take millions of stolen passwords and

198
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,640
try them on Sarah's login page, AI
analyzes the characteristics of these

199
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:07,900
traffic surges, which helps understand
the gradual onset of estimate spikes

200
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:13,330
that often contrast sharply with sudden
appearance of distributed attacks.

201
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,440
It sees the pattern of
rapid FA rapid failures.

202
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,910
From different IP addresses
and blocks, suspicious ranges.

203
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:28,750
The essentials login used by actually such
ips are also forced to reset passwords,

204
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:35,140
ensuring safety of the app data and user
data as well, preventing API scrapping.

205
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:42,110
So what happens and the competitors
uses Spike uses bot to systematically

206
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,230
steal Sarah's entire inventory.

207
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,100
Yeah.

208
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,360
Examines request payload
patterns and sequences.

209
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:57,290
Real users actually browse naturally
while scrappers execute perfect robotic

210
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:01,280
patterns to find data and don't do
anything with the data, like they

211
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,315
don't add it to the cart and all.

212
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:10,265
So that is an identifier and AI
stops those kind of attacks, catching

213
00:14:10,265 --> 00:14:12,575
low and slow account takeover.

214
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:14,285
How does this happen?

215
00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:19,585
And a hacker gets a valid account, say,
and slowly gathers data over weeks.

216
00:14:19,615 --> 00:14:25,675
AI uses behavioral profiling and examines
user session behaviors to spot anomalies.

217
00:14:26,035 --> 00:14:29,665
Like in this case, is the user
logging to just view personal data.

218
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:34,525
And payment details of the account,
then probably that's suspicious.

219
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:40,755
AI models examine request payload
patterns, response code sequences,

220
00:14:40,935 --> 00:14:46,185
and user session behaviors and
statistical correlation across sources.

221
00:14:46,665 --> 00:14:51,080
These capabilities are essential
for detecting distributed attacks,

222
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,760
credential attacks and attacks
like credential, stuffing API,

223
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,250
scrapping and resource exhaustion.

224
00:14:58,625 --> 00:14:58,985
Attempts.

225
00:14:59,485 --> 00:15:03,055
Let's talk about the best part.

226
00:15:03,555 --> 00:15:04,365
The payoff.

227
00:15:04,995 --> 00:15:08,295
Remember those boards that
was sneaking into Sarah's app?

228
00:15:08,745 --> 00:15:14,265
Every one of them was costing her
money by stopping them at the door.

229
00:15:14,655 --> 00:15:19,755
Companies see 30% lower infrastructure
costs because they are not

230
00:15:19,755 --> 00:15:21,165
serving junk traffic anymore.

231
00:15:21,975 --> 00:15:26,265
It teams get 40% of their time
back because they don't have to

232
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:30,695
look at bug things that are not
even getting into the system.

233
00:15:31,175 --> 00:15:31,625
Plus.

234
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:38,210
25% improvement in resource
efficiency by right sizing based

235
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,950
on estimate traffic patterns.

236
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:46,130
This precision of AI driven blocking
reduces the need of over pro over

237
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,960
provisioning infrastructure to
handle potential attack traffic

238
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,080
deserting in substantial savings for.

239
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,790
High traffic applications.

240
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,890
This is a win for security.

241
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,240
This is a win for your team.

242
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,780
This is a huge win for
your budget and company.

243
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,630
And needless to say, this kind of
safeguards in place for users, data

244
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:14,280
leads to reputation of the firm,
which surges the company's evaluation.

245
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,590
And now

246
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,055
this isn't also, this isn't.

247
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,719
Set it and forget it system.

248
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,800
Remember, a committee of experts,
they never stop learning.

249
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:30,590
They are constantly learning
through continuous adapt adaptation.

250
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,189
Few things for them to evolve over time.

251
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:40,144
For example, data collection, traffic
patterns, user behaviors, attack

252
00:16:40,144 --> 00:16:42,384
indicators are continuously gathered.

253
00:16:42,884 --> 00:16:45,854
Drift detection monitoring systems.

254
00:16:46,354 --> 00:16:51,185
Identify when users' behaviors
evolve to understand what is

255
00:16:51,185 --> 00:16:56,935
generic user behavior and what is
an or anomaly pattern analysis.

256
00:16:56,935 --> 00:17:01,705
Online learning algorithms update
models as new data arrives to

257
00:17:01,705 --> 00:17:04,195
identify new patterns to new patterns.

258
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,750
To be aware of the attacks and estimate
user behaviors, field integration,

259
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:15,670
security team, investigations,
and user reports are incorporated.

260
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:21,130
AB testing, gradual rollout of
updates, validates improvements.

261
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,460
This ensures protection remains effective
as new threats emerged and legitimate

262
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,800
usage patterns shift over time.

263
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,380
The system that protected
Sarah's app last year.

264
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,130
Evolves to handle newer attacks.

265
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,360
If it happens tomorrow,

266
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,210
how do we know it's working?

267
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,490
We need to both tech.

268
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,650
We need both technical metrics like
detection, accuracy, performance

269
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:51,265
resource utilization, and adaptation
rates, and business impact metrics.

270
00:17:51,765 --> 00:17:52,890
Remember Sarah's story.

271
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,480
The real success wasn't just blocking
the attacks, but the revenue impact of

272
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,980
blocking estimate users and improved
customer satisfaction, fewer support

273
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,440
tickets and reduced infrastructure costs.

274
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,090
Effective evaluation necessities
holistic view, combining security

275
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,490
outcomes with tangible business impact.

276
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:19,260
Relying solely on security
metrics provides an incomplete

277
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,400
picture of the system.

278
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,020
Systems, true performance and value.

279
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:31,045
Now let's make this concrete with
real world case study that could,

280
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,125
that could be Sarah's success story.

281
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:39,535
A major e-commerce platform was
experiencing credential stuffing attacks.

282
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:47,530
During peak shopping season, traditional
rate limiting blocked estimate shoppers

283
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:53,800
resulting in loss sales losses ti
estimated to be 2 million annually.

284
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:59,890
This, they deployed this because of this.

285
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:03,775
Later on, they deployed
AI driven rate limiting.

286
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,100
With progressive throttling and user
segmentation, the system analyzed

287
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:14,245
50 plus behavioral indicators to
distinguish between estimate shoppers.

288
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,680
And attackers, the results are staggering.

289
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:24,700
False positive rate reduced by 92%,
successfully blocked sophisticated

290
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:32,320
distributed attacks while hand handling
300% traffic spikes during flash sales.

291
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:38,795
Infrastructure cost reduced by
25% through elimination of attack.

292
00:19:39,295 --> 00:19:42,235
Attack traffic and this ingest theory.

293
00:19:42,295 --> 00:19:46,135
This is proven strategy
with dramatic results.

294
00:19:46,635 --> 00:19:47,295
Looking ahead.

295
00:19:47,535 --> 00:19:52,725
We see emerging technologies like deep
learning for more accurate pattern

296
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:56,595
recognition, reinforcement learning
for adaptive response strategies,

297
00:19:57,165 --> 00:20:02,535
and automated feature engineering,
reducing expert requirements,

298
00:20:02,805 --> 00:20:04,575
reducing expertise requirements.

299
00:20:05,085 --> 00:20:10,155
Organizations that invest in
building the necessary capabilities

300
00:20:10,155 --> 00:20:11,715
will gain strategic advantages.

301
00:20:12,215 --> 00:20:13,625
Superior security.

302
00:20:14,075 --> 00:20:20,315
PO Posture, enhanced reliability and
user experience reduced operational

303
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:25,805
overhead and competitive differentiation
to better a PF protection.

304
00:20:26,015 --> 00:20:30,425
Like I told earlier, if your
protecting your data and user's

305
00:20:30,425 --> 00:20:34,510
data, your reputation increases and
so does your company's evaluation.

306
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,150
And as a digital economy.

307
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,250
Continues to expand those with
most effective API protection

308
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:45,680
strategies will be best positioned
to capture the opportunities of

309
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,360
increasingly corrected world.

310
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,000
So what's the story?

311
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,435
It's about moving from rigid, dumb
rule that hurts your business.

312
00:20:54,225 --> 00:20:57,345
To a smart adapter
system that protects it.

313
00:20:58,065 --> 00:21:03,255
It's about using the cloud to build
a team of AI services that work

314
00:21:03,255 --> 00:21:06,315
together as a genius security guard.

315
00:21:06,645 --> 00:21:11,565
It's about keeping your doors open for
businesses, for business, not businesses.

316
00:21:11,685 --> 00:21:15,825
Of course, it could be businesses as
well for everyone who brings their.

317
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,270
And firmly closed for those who don't.

318
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:24,420
The future is intelligent, adaptive,
and efficient, and it's available today.

319
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,280
So let's make use of it in your
respective systems and companies

320
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,210
wherever you are working.

321
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:35,530
I would like to thank all of you for
this opportunity and sticking with

322
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:38,770
me to understand this topic today.

323
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,700
Thank you.
