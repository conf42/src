1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:00,849
Today.

2
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:07,725
Today we'll be talking about a
very hot topic, SRE versus DevOps.

3
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:11,504
We would answer the
question, are they the same?

4
00:00:12,164 --> 00:00:14,024
Are they competitors?

5
00:00:14,204 --> 00:00:16,305
Are they secret allies?

6
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:20,794
And by the end of this talk
you would know exactly how they

7
00:00:20,974 --> 00:00:27,095
differ, where they overlap, and
how to make them work together.

8
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:27,994
So let's dive in.

9
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:31,624
So the myth under reality, right?

10
00:00:31,774 --> 00:00:37,025
Many people think SRE and DevOps are the
same thing, but with different labels.

11
00:00:37,725 --> 00:00:38,535
This is just a myth.

12
00:00:39,075 --> 00:00:45,005
The actual realities that they
share the same goals, but they

13
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:46,715
solve different problems, right?

14
00:00:46,715 --> 00:00:48,935
So same goals, different problems.

15
00:00:49,335 --> 00:00:51,765
You should think of them like, cousins.

16
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:54,125
Different personalities, right?

17
00:00:54,685 --> 00:00:56,545
DevOps is all about speed.

18
00:00:56,875 --> 00:01:04,185
Collaboration whilst SRAs more about
reliability and engineering rigor.

19
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:09,165
So the magic happens when
you use them together.

20
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:11,745
So what are the core philosophies?

21
00:01:11,755 --> 00:01:14,515
DevOps emerged, to break down.

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,080
The silos between development
and operations, right?

23
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,480
It's it has a mantra to move fast, right?

24
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,430
To automate everything.

25
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,240
If you viewed it, you should run it right.

26
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:36,650
Whilst SRA on the other hand, was born in
Google actually, and its more about how.

27
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,120
Engineer reliability into our systems.

28
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,140
So we don't just wanna build
softwares that works, right?

29
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,440
We wanna make them reliable, right?

30
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:53,410
So both of them sort of love
automation, but SE, adds things

31
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,067
like metrics, metrics like sli.

32
00:01:55,567 --> 00:01:58,147
So the focus of DevOps is.

33
00:01:58,647 --> 00:02:01,827
Silos between dev and ops, right?

34
00:02:02,127 --> 00:02:07,737
And the focus for SRE to make
systems reliable in a nutshell.

35
00:02:08,237 --> 00:02:10,576
So what are the key differences, right?

36
00:02:10,906 --> 00:02:13,576
So this is where we get technical, right?

37
00:02:14,117 --> 00:02:17,107
And not just technical,
we get tactical as well.

38
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:23,016
So DevOps measures the success
of development frequency.

39
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:30,886
Or so one of the key things to say
DevOps is successful is by measuring

40
00:02:30,936 --> 00:02:38,316
the deployment frequency whilst the SRE
is more concerned about uptime, right?

41
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:43,277
We don't really care much about the
speed or it's more about uptime, right?

42
00:02:43,277 --> 00:02:47,142
So DevOps uses ci cd tools whilst SRE.

43
00:02:48,022 --> 00:02:50,632
The monitoring dashboards.

44
00:02:51,262 --> 00:02:58,281
So they both rely on Kubernetes like tools
like Kuber, Kubernetes, Terraform, and,

45
00:02:58,332 --> 00:03:00,852
most importantly like a blameless culture.

46
00:03:01,452 --> 00:03:07,911
The difference though is that DevOps
removes the war, the whilst SR Ebu

47
00:03:08,151 --> 00:03:11,061
like guide rails in the Nutshells.

48
00:03:11,872 --> 00:03:13,101
So what are the secrets?

49
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:14,152
Weapons, right?

50
00:03:14,691 --> 00:03:17,631
Here's where SRE gets spicy.

51
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,402
Error budget quantifies the risk, right?

52
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:26,492
If your system has for three minutes
of downtime this month, then SRM

53
00:03:26,492 --> 00:03:32,981
might hold feature release right
until you improve reliability.

54
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:38,101
Whilst DevOp teams might see this
as no, just a speed bomb, right?

55
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:38,881
It's fine.

56
00:03:38,971 --> 00:03:39,961
It's just a speed bomb.

57
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:44,011
So the trick is to align
these perspectives early on.

58
00:03:44,011 --> 00:03:47,712
When you start using your team,
as soon as you can, right?

59
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:53,801
So then that makes a question,
when do we use DevOps?

60
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:55,452
When do we use s?

61
00:03:55,962 --> 00:04:01,601
I think people for example, like
the answer is that startups often,

62
00:04:01,652 --> 00:04:03,781
pick DevOps for speed, right?

63
00:04:03,871 --> 00:04:07,022
They need to get their products
to market as soon as possible.

64
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:13,232
Yeah, they care about reliability, but
it's not like the priority at that stage.

65
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,801
Whilst enterprises.

66
00:04:15,301 --> 00:04:19,712
Complex systems, they, they, now
they've gotten to a stage where they

67
00:04:19,712 --> 00:04:22,081
care more about like reliability.

68
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:27,831
But what should the best themes, like
what the best themes, what should they do?

69
00:04:28,341 --> 00:04:30,981
I think the best things should
borrow from both, right?

70
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:35,206
Netflix, for example,
uses SRE for streaming.

71
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:38,766
But it uses DevOps for its internal tools.

72
00:04:39,186 --> 00:04:42,937
So it's, it's your turn to,
determine where your team

73
00:04:42,937 --> 00:04:44,857
fits and decide accordingly.

74
00:04:45,457 --> 00:04:48,577
So how do we bridge the gap, right?

75
00:04:48,697 --> 00:04:50,737
How do we bridge the gap between the two?

76
00:04:51,137 --> 00:04:55,037
Conflict happens when DevOps
says, oh, we need to ship, right?

77
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:57,647
And SRE says, no.

78
00:04:58,157 --> 00:04:59,236
It's not reliable.

79
00:04:59,236 --> 00:05:00,197
We can't ship yet.

80
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:02,477
So how do we fix this?

81
00:05:02,477 --> 00:05:04,727
Or how do we resolve this conflict?

82
00:05:05,027 --> 00:05:08,056
So the main thing is
to collaborate, right?

83
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:14,986
Have the SRE teams join, sprint
planning meetings and let it evolve.

84
00:05:15,526 --> 00:05:15,766
Team.

85
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:17,671
Define the s right.

86
00:05:18,171 --> 00:05:22,962
Always should always share the
blame and the credit as well.

87
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:29,191
So let's take a very quick,
brief case study, right?

88
00:05:29,581 --> 00:05:31,501
Say we have a SaaS company, right?

89
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:38,231
They currently struggling and the
DevOps team is like burning out,

90
00:05:38,361 --> 00:05:40,071
fixing nightly outages, right?

91
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:44,166
They brought the SRE team to set SLOs.

92
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:50,516
Now they would be able to like track
error budgets in their ci cd pipeline.

93
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:54,486
So the results will be that
they now have like fewer.

94
00:05:54,986 --> 00:06:00,036
Midnight outages and more high
fives, which is a win for everyone.

95
00:06:00,606 --> 00:06:05,106
So the main thing is if you
notice, for example, you're having

96
00:06:05,106 --> 00:06:08,586
more reliability issues, right?

97
00:06:08,976 --> 00:06:15,846
Then that might be like a good indicator
that you need to consider SRE, right?

98
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:20,091
The key takeaway is that I
would like is that, DevOps.

99
00:06:20,926 --> 00:06:28,426
It's not the same as SRE, but
they reinforce each other, right?

100
00:06:29,236 --> 00:06:31,576
They work best when combined.

101
00:06:32,386 --> 00:06:35,206
So you don't need to choose between them.

102
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:39,076
You don't need to choose
DevOps over SRE, right?

103
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:43,106
You need to decide, based
on your requirements.

104
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:46,696
So my suggestion would be that we, you.

105
00:06:47,196 --> 00:06:54,232
Lead to SLOs to your next sprint or
invite the sre, to a DevOps retro.

106
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:59,972
And tiny steps leads to
big wins and I think, yeah.

107
00:07:00,472 --> 00:07:03,712
So the next steps what
should be the next steps?

108
00:07:03,712 --> 00:07:08,422
So the main thing is that you should
be a champion for change, right?

109
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:14,512
The bridge between DevOps and SRE
thinking, especially in our like teams.

110
00:07:15,152 --> 00:07:20,873
Also it's to continuously learn, read
Google SI read books and dev books

111
00:07:20,923 --> 00:07:23,893
and lastly is to implement, right?

112
00:07:23,983 --> 00:07:30,103
You need to begin measuring SLI for
critical services, but then it's

113
00:07:30,193 --> 00:07:35,473
all about your specific needs and
you know the needs of the team.

114
00:07:36,013 --> 00:07:36,193
Yeah.

115
00:07:36,193 --> 00:07:39,063
Thank you for watching
and have a good day.

116
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:39,603
Bye.
