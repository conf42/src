1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,650
Hello, good morning.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,480
Good afternoon.

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,880
Good evening everyone Depending
on where you are joining from.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:13,209
my name is Akshat Kapoor and I welcome
you to my talk on real time analytics

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,239
in IIoT, before we dive in a bit
about myself, I have been in the

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,489
tech industry for over 20 years now,
working with some great organizations

7
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:30,489
like Alcatel Lucent Enterprise,
Dell Labs, and Nokia, my career has

8
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:33,349
mostly focused on product management.

9
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:38,349
guiding product portfolios and finding
innovative solutions that drive growth

10
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:41,089
for the company at Alcatel Lucent.

11
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,119
I am responsible for the full
range of, Ethernet switching

12
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,939
products from campus land and
industrial Ethernet to data center.

13
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:50,169
Switches.

14
00:00:50,669 --> 00:00:56,579
My current areas of focus are
AI, ML, and industrial IoT.

15
00:00:57,459 --> 00:00:59,619
And that relates to the topic for today.

16
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:02,229
And that brings me back to the topic.

17
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:07,559
IoT and industrial IoT are
transforming industries by connecting

18
00:01:07,559 --> 00:01:11,519
devices and creating smarter
and more efficient operations.

19
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:17,189
Today we will uncover its potential
and go through the journey of how

20
00:01:17,199 --> 00:01:22,010
real time analytics is revolutionizing
the industrial processes.

21
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:26,530
We will start with some building blocks
of the architecture that enables real

22
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:33,280
time analytics and go on to see how
all these pieces put together enable

23
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,340
the real time decision making for
predictive preventive maintenance.

24
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,950
for optimizing operations and
saving money for various industries.

25
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:49,450
So let's talk about IoT or
industrial IoT in modern industries.

26
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:55,200
The internet of things or IoT has
evolved as a cornerstone of industry 4.

27
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,690
0, which is connecting physical
devices to enable smarter operations.

28
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:07,030
The convergence of IT and OT systems
drives automation and efficiency,

29
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,510
offering key benefits like predictive
maintenance, operational optimization,

30
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,760
and real time decision making.

31
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,580
Examples of its transformative effect can
be seen in industries like manufacturing,

32
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:28,740
logistics, oil and gas, utilities such as
electrical utilities, and smart cities.

33
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,410
Real time data processing
and why it matters.

34
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,340
Real time data is critical
in dynamic environments.

35
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,830
where timely insights lead
to competitive advantages.

36
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:48,159
However, businesses face
challenges like scalability,

37
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,160
interoperability, and handling
diverse data coming from the sensors.

38
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,540
By overcoming these hurdles,
organizations can unlock faster

39
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,800
decision making and operational success.

40
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,730
A manufacturer might use sensors
throughout an assembly line to predict

41
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,160
when a machine will likely break down.

42
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,860
Or an oil and gas organization might
use predictive analytics on data from

43
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:18,520
sensors installed across a pipeline
to help identify corrosion and damage.

44
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:24,560
Industrial IoT brings together connected
intelligent devices and analytics in

45
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,760
a way that allows organizations to
monitor Collect, exchange, analyze,

46
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,230
and deliver valuable new insights
about their processes and systems.

47
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:44,860
Now, we'll talk about some of the benefits
of IIoT real time analytics, and how we

48
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,740
are utilizing zettabytes of IoT data.

49
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:55,200
Now, as we know that the IoT devices
produces a ton of data, And, data

50
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,340
from these telemetrics about a
device or machine's condition, when

51
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,790
combined with historical performance
records, can offer deep insights that

52
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,120
predict and help prevent failures.

53
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,240
For instance, a common method
to prevent equipment downtime is

54
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,420
replacing a component as it approaches
its mean time to failure, or MTTF.

55
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:25,230
By leveraging machine learning based
analytics on real time IoT data combined

56
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,820
with product history information, it is
possible to detect early warning signs

57
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:37,580
of potential issues in parts before
they reach their failure age or MTTF.

58
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,990
More efficient and automated
QA processes reduce cost while

59
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,350
improving product quality.

60
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,420
IoT data can help identify inefficiencies.

61
00:04:49,095 --> 00:04:52,505
that when resolved lead
to increased output.

62
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:59,355
Now let's look at the basic building
blocks of some of these IoT architectures.

63
00:04:59,855 --> 00:05:03,745
You can call it a three layer
architecture that you see in the blue

64
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:07,805
on the left hand side, or you can call
them four if you want to follow the

65
00:05:07,805 --> 00:05:09,475
architecture on the right in green.

66
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:13,695
That includes the application layer
that includes the applications

67
00:05:13,695 --> 00:05:17,249
and all that run on top of
analytics and the management layer.

68
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:20,719
But the basic three layers
are the same in both of them.

69
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:23,169
So let's start with the sensing layer.

70
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:26,589
The sensing layer is the one
which collects data using

71
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:28,319
edge devices and sensors.

72
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:34,439
Firstly, there is the issue of data
preparation to harness the value of IoT

73
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,809
and deliver innovation driving insights.

74
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:43,344
Organizations must quickly prepare
and standardize great volumes

75
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:45,424
of disparate unstructured data.

76
00:05:45,924 --> 00:05:51,254
This is a common problem across
all any AI ML based system,

77
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:53,144
which is required for analytics.

78
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:59,129
But it is more compounded in
industrial IoT because the sensors

79
00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:02,709
from different parts of the
manufacturing line or wherever they

80
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:05,179
are installed have very disparate data.

81
00:06:05,309 --> 00:06:08,389
It's, some have geolocation
tagging enabled, some have

82
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:10,009
not, and so on and so forth.

83
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:15,739
As we all know, the data preparation
takes up to 80 percent of the time and

84
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:18,359
resources in a data analysis operation.

85
00:06:18,859 --> 00:06:21,829
In heterogeneous IoT systems.

86
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:27,519
And devices exhibit a wide variety
of characteristics and differ in

87
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:31,639
their computing, communication,
and storage capabilities.

88
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:34,559
Now let's talk about
the communication layer.

89
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:38,869
The communication layer ensures
efficient data transmission

90
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:40,249
through robust protocols.

91
00:06:40,749 --> 00:06:45,629
The communication layer, supported by
multi service gateways, forms the central

92
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:48,479
network for IoT data transmission.

93
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:56,559
Managing both uplink and downlink of
feedback from the, from the analytics

94
00:06:56,559 --> 00:07:03,389
layer due to the diversity of the IOT
devices, various communication protocols

95
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,679
are utilized within IOT systems.

96
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:12,379
And I'll be talking about this in
another slide further down and finally,

97
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:18,109
the the analytics layer processes this
data that is coming from the sensing

98
00:07:18,109 --> 00:07:24,739
layer to the communication layer and
using edge cloud or hybrid methods,

99
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,039
balancing latency and performance.

100
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:31,879
And we will also be talking about
this further in, in this presentation.

101
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:37,789
Real time analytics in IoT systems
emphasizes designing system architectures

102
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:44,099
capable of performing data analysis and
delivering responses within a specified

103
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:46,539
timeframe, referred to as the deadline.

104
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,179
Depending on this application, this
deadline can vary, ranging from

105
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:55,594
nanoseconds in computer network
communications, To milliseconds

106
00:07:55,624 --> 00:08:01,164
in medical diagnosis real time
industrial iot systems are of two

107
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:03,614
types predictive and prescriptive.

108
00:08:04,224 --> 00:08:07,334
And they are different from diagnostic
or descriptive kind of analytics

109
00:08:07,384 --> 00:08:09,794
because they have to work in real time.

110
00:08:10,294 --> 00:08:13,434
Traditionally, there are two
types of architectures used in

111
00:08:13,464 --> 00:08:18,454
the analytics layer, which is the
edge, cloud hybrid or the cloud.

112
00:08:19,304 --> 00:08:23,704
There's also a third type of, new
kind of, analytics architecture,

113
00:08:23,944 --> 00:08:28,804
which is based on simulation and
that's the most upcoming and promising

114
00:08:28,804 --> 00:08:33,954
technology that is there today and I
will talk about it in another slide.

115
00:08:34,454 --> 00:08:38,084
So let's talk about the first
layer which is the sensors from

116
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:39,874
where the actual data is collected.

117
00:08:40,374 --> 00:08:47,425
The specific type of sensors that are
deployed within an IIoT system depends

118
00:08:47,425 --> 00:08:51,005
on the machinery being monitored
and the parameter most critical

119
00:08:51,075 --> 00:08:53,655
for predicting potential failures.

120
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:58,525
So common type of sensors that are
employed are vibration sensors,

121
00:08:58,745 --> 00:09:04,025
temperature sensors, pressure sensors,
or current and power consumption sensors,

122
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:10,110
or any, which is required for the type of
environment other than the type choosing

123
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:15,370
the right type of sensor, the strategic
placement of the sensors throughout

124
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,980
the machinery is also essential for
capturing the most informative data.

125
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,819
Now we talk about the second layer,
which is the communication layer.

126
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:27,409
which is required for real time analytics.

127
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:35,589
Automating processes by integrating the
operational technology OT with information

128
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:38,329
technology IT as mandated by industry 4.

129
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:46,009
0 brings stringent real time demands for
industrial networks making predictable and

130
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:48,259
reliable packet routing very essential.

131
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:53,199
Traditional IP networks which
operate on a best effort basis are

132
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:55,379
insufficient for these real time needs.

133
00:09:56,149 --> 00:10:00,369
and require specialized protocols
and standards to meet these

134
00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:01,709
performance expectations.

135
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:05,459
Depending on the type of industrial
network, there are different type of

136
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:07,439
requirements for the network to perform.

137
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:12,499
For example, autonomous systems,
such as robots and drones,

138
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:17,479
require high predictability and
medium to high latency tolerance.

139
00:10:17,979 --> 00:10:23,189
Remote control applications need low
bandwidth, but highly reliable networks.

140
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:28,359
Data analysis and monitoring require high
bandwidth for sensor data aggregation.

141
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:33,449
Traditional embedded systems only
have limited computing capabilities

142
00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:35,749
due to power and space constraints.

143
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:41,759
To this end, currently, especially in
the field of mobile edge computing,

144
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:46,749
considers the offloading of delay
sensitive tasks to local servers.

145
00:10:47,249 --> 00:10:51,669
Worker safety systems emphasize
latency and reliability to

146
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:53,049
react promptly to hazards.

147
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:57,729
Now talking about security, which
is true for any kind of network, but

148
00:10:57,739 --> 00:11:02,569
more so in on industrial networks, not
only the data on the network should

149
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:06,639
be encrypted, it should be able to
detect network intrusions in time.

150
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:13,069
And last but not the least, the, as
networks are used to converge IT and OT

151
00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:18,219
systems to build a distributed system,
everyone should have a common and

152
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:22,989
shared understanding of time and real
time for real time networks to work.

153
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:27,809
No one single system today is capable
of meeting all the requirements.

154
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:34,339
And, of course, the type of network
that is chosen is based on, the type

155
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:39,059
of end system and what its requirements
are in terms of predictability,

156
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:42,279
latency, bandwidth, so on and so forth.

157
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:46,799
as I said, real time analytics
requires real time networks.

158
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:51,379
The current package switch network,
which is based on best effort, is not

159
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:56,929
sufficient to meet the requirements
of real time analytics in IIoT.

160
00:11:57,429 --> 00:12:03,469
Various approaches can be applied to
improve real time IIoT networking, and

161
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:07,319
there is no one size fits all here and
depends on the end user environment.

162
00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:12,449
Some of these approaches are
software defined networking or SDN.

163
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:19,479
As industrial networks grow more complex
with mixed computing systems and real

164
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:24,609
time demands, SDN offers a solution
for managing this heterogeneity.

165
00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:32,549
Next comes the TSN and this has to do
with the shared sense of time and a common

166
00:12:32,689 --> 00:12:38,149
and more secure way of for networks to
be able to deliver the time across all

167
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:42,709
the devices whether they are IoT devices
or IT systems connected on the network.

168
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:49,759
Time sensitive networking or TSN is
a set of IEEE standards for Ethernet

169
00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:56,089
enabling networks to achieve bounded
latency and minimal packet loss for

170
00:12:56,119 --> 00:12:58,109
critical traffic at the data link layer.

171
00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:02,199
It ensures lower jitter and
more orderly packet delivery.

172
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:08,909
Additionally, it incorporates precise and
detailed quality of service mechanisms.

173
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:13,839
New standards have evolved that have
improved some of the shortcomings

174
00:13:14,099 --> 00:13:20,659
and the lack of flexibility of TSN by
integrating it with other systems such

175
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:26,609
as OPC or adding profanate support,
which is a mechanism for visibility.

176
00:13:27,109 --> 00:13:31,379
of IT and OT systems in a common
network or in a common management plane.

177
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:37,289
OPC or Open Platform Communications
Unified Architecture is an

178
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:40,989
interoperability standard for
reliable information exchange.

179
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:48,769
And has gained a lot of momentum
for discussion on IIoT networks now

180
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:50,589
talking about wireless technologies.

181
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:56,529
So a very natural step is to,
transition this TSN methods

182
00:13:56,529 --> 00:13:57,759
or time sensitive network.

183
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:01,849
networking methods to use to be
working with wireless technologies.

184
00:14:02,349 --> 00:14:08,344
similarly, the I iot devices, which
require 5G wireless connectivity.

185
00:14:09,284 --> 00:14:13,274
The network slicing there allows for
logically separated virtual networks

186
00:14:13,304 --> 00:14:15,374
over the same physical 5G network.

187
00:14:15,874 --> 00:14:19,294
And last but not the least, there
are some technologies that have

188
00:14:19,294 --> 00:14:21,664
evolved on the device layer, such as.

189
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:27,489
MAC layer filtering that mitigates
the effects of best effort traffic

190
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:29,469
reception on real time tasks.

191
00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:34,829
So you see the technologies on the
networking side have to evolve to

192
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:39,679
manage the data coming from the sensor
to enable the real time analytics.

193
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,739
And as I said, there is no one size
fits all, and it all depends on the

194
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:49,669
end user environment to adopt the
right type of network and the right

195
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:52,029
type of technology to enable this.

196
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:58,099
Okay, now we talk about the analytics
layer and what are the different

197
00:14:58,109 --> 00:15:03,429
type of architectures that are used
in enabling the analytics The first

198
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:05,529
one is the cloud based architecture.

199
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:10,219
The cloud based architecture is a
centralized, processing in remote

200
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:14,729
cloud servers, provides high
computational power, but there is a

201
00:15:14,729 --> 00:15:19,799
challenge here, which is there is a
high latency, there is a limitation

202
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:24,559
of bandwidth, and the connection
could be unstable, which may not be

203
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:27,489
suitable for a real time application.

204
00:15:27,989 --> 00:15:33,669
Next comes the edge cloud collaboration or
the edge cloud collaborative architecture.

205
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:38,279
This combines local edge
computing with cloud resources.

206
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:43,079
Edge devices process data
closer to IoT devices.

207
00:15:43,469 --> 00:15:46,889
which reduces latency and
bandwidth requirements.

208
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:51,729
Cloud platforms handle the complex
analytics and storage tasks, whereas

209
00:15:51,729 --> 00:15:55,809
the edge devices manage the latency
and bandwidth requirements by

210
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,389
being closer to the IoT devices.

211
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:02,479
This hybrid model optimizes task
allocation for real time requirements

212
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:07,989
while mitigating the challenges that are
faced in purely cloud based architectures.

213
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:11,399
these are the two which are, have
been traditionally been used.

214
00:16:12,374 --> 00:16:17,594
And there is a new architecture that
is emerging today is the digital twin.

215
00:16:18,094 --> 00:16:25,384
The digital twins are virtual replicas of
physical systems, which are continuously

216
00:16:25,424 --> 00:16:30,514
updated with real time data to mirror
the actual state of the system.

217
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:36,964
At that point, they are very useful in
predictive analysis, process optimization,

218
00:16:37,494 --> 00:16:39,514
and data driven decision making.

219
00:16:40,014 --> 00:16:43,004
These are combined with simulation models.

220
00:16:43,284 --> 00:16:45,814
for decision support systems.

221
00:16:46,314 --> 00:16:51,304
There are mainly two types of models
used for simulation in industries.

222
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:55,234
The first one is the
discrete event simulation.

223
00:16:55,734 --> 00:17:01,844
This models allows for analyzing complex
manufacturing systems by creating a

224
00:17:01,844 --> 00:17:09,074
model and replicating their behavior
over a period of time and then producing

225
00:17:09,574 --> 00:17:11,684
models, producing predictions over that.

226
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:14,644
The second one is a
hybrid simulation method.

227
00:17:15,144 --> 00:17:19,874
This involves integrating the virtual
model with the real world system.

228
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:25,254
So imagine a digital twin replica
running, integrated into a

229
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:27,544
physical system as another node.

230
00:17:28,444 --> 00:17:33,714
And it is continuously monitoring
and provides adaptive control

231
00:17:33,794 --> 00:17:35,714
of the system in real time.

232
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:40,734
So these, this is some of, this is one
of the new technologies that are emerging

233
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:47,909
on the horizon and which is very useful
for Real time analytics in IOT, IIOT.

234
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:51,549
Now we have, gone through
all the three layers.

235
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:53,869
we have the data coming from the sensors.

236
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:58,099
We have talked about what
kind of networks are required.

237
00:17:58,489 --> 00:18:05,049
To send this data across with minimal
latency, right amount of bandwidth and,

238
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:07,819
carrying the time, and being secure.

239
00:18:08,749 --> 00:18:12,179
And then the third approach we
saw how we, the architecture

240
00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:13,839
of where the analytics happens.

241
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:16,719
Now we want to talk about is.

242
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:23,049
What AI techniques we can use to
generate the real time analytics.

243
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:27,379
So there are two approaches here,
which, are machine learning based

244
00:18:27,379 --> 00:18:31,669
approaches and the other one being
the deep learning based approach.

245
00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:37,569
The choice of machine learning, learning
algorithms used in real time analytic

246
00:18:37,569 --> 00:18:43,569
systems depend on several factors such
as, the type of equipment being monitored,

247
00:18:43,979 --> 00:18:45,979
what is the intended functionality.

248
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:50,709
For example, you want to do anomaly
detection, or you want to do

249
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:55,489
classification, or you want to predict
the remaining useful life of an

250
00:18:55,889 --> 00:18:57,999
equipment, and so on and so forth.

251
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:03,649
And also, this is influenced by
the attributes of the available

252
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:06,729
data set, which may not be the same
for different kinds of situations.

253
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:13,239
So in the machine learning approach,
we have broadly two methods, supervised

254
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:14,909
learning and unsupervised learning.

255
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:18,809
So this is common for
any AI ML based system.

256
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:24,049
I'm just going to highlight here
what is mostly used in these

257
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:27,429
terms for industrial IOT systems.

258
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:34,039
So supervised learning algorithms, as we
know, Excel at pattern recognition and

259
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,669
classification tasks for label data set.

260
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:42,149
where each data point is associated
with a predefined category or outcome.

261
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:49,709
Support vector machines or SVMs and the
decision trees, they are very powerful

262
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:55,689
supervised learning algorithms that are
well suited at classification tasks.

263
00:19:56,249 --> 00:20:00,039
and that can help identify
potential equipment issues.

264
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:01,089
Okay.

265
00:20:01,589 --> 00:20:08,579
Now, contrary to supervised learning,
unsupervised learning algorithms work

266
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:14,184
with unlabeled data where data points
do not have any predefined categories.

267
00:20:14,684 --> 00:20:19,874
They are particularly effective
at uncovering patterns and

268
00:20:19,874 --> 00:20:24,254
relationships within the data,
making them well suited for tasks

269
00:20:24,334 --> 00:20:27,594
like anomaly detection and so on.

270
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:33,064
Within unsupervised learning,
techniques like k means clustering,

271
00:20:33,174 --> 00:20:37,944
which is a popular unsupervised
learning method, is used for data

272
00:20:37,944 --> 00:20:43,794
segmentation and the other one being
the principal component analysis, PCA.

273
00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:48,549
is a dimensionality reduction
method that extracts the most

274
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:50,569
important features from a data set.

275
00:20:51,069 --> 00:20:56,179
Supervised and unsupervised learning
techniques provide a robust set

276
00:20:56,179 --> 00:21:01,979
of tools for detecting patterns
and anomalies in sensor data

277
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:05,269
gathered by industrial IoT systems.

278
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:09,519
Now, utilizing these machine
learning algorithms, systems can

279
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,959
derive meaningful insights from
real time data streams, supporting

280
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:19,564
proactive maintenance strategies,
and improving overall equipment

281
00:21:19,614 --> 00:21:22,224
efficiency in industrial operations.

282
00:21:22,724 --> 00:21:28,754
But deep learning that utilizes
artificial neural networks with multiple

283
00:21:28,794 --> 00:21:33,954
hidden layers is capable of learning
complex patterns and relationships

284
00:21:34,014 --> 00:21:40,264
within data, which often outperform
traditional machine learning algorithms.

285
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:43,379
in certain applications.

286
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:47,909
So it all depends on your end
application, whether you want to

287
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:51,059
apply the machine learning approach
or the deep learning technique.

288
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:56,169
Of course, deep learning techniques
are more complex to deploy, but they

289
00:21:56,169 --> 00:22:01,939
do offer several advantages over
machine learning techniques such as.

290
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:08,499
automatic feature extraction, improved
pattern recognition, real time anomaly

291
00:22:08,499 --> 00:22:12,299
detection, scalability, and adaptability.

292
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,999
Some of the architectures, which I'm
going to talk about, is common with any

293
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:20,659
other deep learning techniques deployed
in other machine learning algorithms.

294
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:26,709
But here in industrial IoT, the most
common ones used are convolutional neural

295
00:22:26,709 --> 00:22:31,319
networks, Recurrent neural networks
and of course the hybrid of the two.

296
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:37,204
The advantage of convolutional neural
networks is to automatically learn and

297
00:22:37,204 --> 00:22:39,594
extract key features from raw sensor data.

298
00:22:40,094 --> 00:22:46,764
Whereas the RNNs, Recurrent Neural
Networks, have the ability to learn

299
00:22:46,904 --> 00:22:49,154
long term dependencies within the data.

300
00:22:49,654 --> 00:22:57,004
Within RNNs, Long Short Term Memory,
or LSTM, networks analyze historical

301
00:22:57,004 --> 00:23:02,944
sensor data combined with equipment
failure timestamps, to learn machinery

302
00:23:02,944 --> 00:23:04,984
degradation patterns over time.

303
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:10,664
This ability enables them to
accurately predict the remaining

304
00:23:10,664 --> 00:23:12,474
useful life of equipment.

305
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:19,354
A third model, which is very promising
and a new one, is focusing on integrating

306
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:27,649
the strengths of CNNs and LSTMs into
a unified deep learning architecture.

307
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:33,529
CNNs can be utilized for extracting
features from sensor data, while

308
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:40,209
LSTMs leverage these features to
capture temporal dependencies and

309
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:45,274
predict equipment health or remaining
useful life of the equipment.

310
00:23:45,774 --> 00:23:51,744
This hybrid approach has the
potential to improve the accuracy and

311
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:54,874
efficiency of AI driven solutions.

312
00:23:55,374 --> 00:23:59,064
So we have talked about all the three
layers and we have talked about what

313
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:02,924
sort of analytics to apply to get
the real time digital analytics.

314
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:09,084
Now is the time to see the IoT
applications in action and how they are

315
00:24:09,094 --> 00:24:11,724
being used across multiple industries.

316
00:24:12,704 --> 00:24:19,054
They span, of course, multiple industries,
smart systems, revolutionize healthcare,

317
00:24:19,474 --> 00:24:23,994
energy grids, and environmental
monitoring, real time analytics,

318
00:24:24,024 --> 00:24:31,274
monitor traffic in smart cities, manage
energy usage, and detect anomalies.

319
00:24:31,774 --> 00:24:34,964
Examples include predicting
traffic congestion using

320
00:24:34,964 --> 00:24:36,984
sensor and social media data.

321
00:24:37,484 --> 00:24:42,364
In smart healthcare, IoT devices
support chronic disease monitoring

322
00:24:42,534 --> 00:24:43,944
and emergency detection.

323
00:24:44,444 --> 00:24:50,594
The edge cloud collaboration architecture
in analytics enables timely responses

324
00:24:50,914 --> 00:24:57,194
as seen in systems for diseases such as
obstructive sleep apnea and dementia care.

325
00:24:57,694 --> 00:25:03,449
In smart electricity grids, Real
time data ensures efficient energy

326
00:25:03,449 --> 00:25:06,409
distribution, and minimizing the outages.

327
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:11,939
Analytics optimize demand response
system for better energy management

328
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:17,559
and in industrial IoT, they facilitate
automation, predictive maintenance,

329
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:22,689
and process optimization using low
latency network architectures to

330
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:24,819
meet critical operational demands.

331
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:27,669
And the third one is on the digital twins.

332
00:25:27,989 --> 00:25:29,109
we talked about it earlier.

333
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:33,129
They are helpful in optimizing
production and supply chain.

334
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:38,429
And they can be seen in aviation
industry's use of predictive

335
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:39,909
analytics to reduce the downtime.

336
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:44,599
Of course, no system is perfect
and there are, of course,

337
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:47,899
challenges in IoT data processing.

338
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:52,959
Managing IoT data involves
addressing its volume, velocity,

339
00:25:52,989 --> 00:25:54,899
and variety of different data sets.

340
00:25:55,399 --> 00:26:01,109
Networking demands such as time sensitive
networking and advancements like 5G

341
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:06,719
are very critical to ensure seamless
connectivity from a network standpoint.

342
00:26:07,219 --> 00:26:12,789
Additionally, there is currently a lack
of standardization across platforms.

343
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:16,399
which are hindering the seamless
integration and interoperability

344
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:20,119
of IOT or industrial IOT systems.

345
00:26:20,529 --> 00:26:25,889
So you could have wireless
and your IOT devices could be

346
00:26:25,889 --> 00:26:30,249
connected through wireless as
well as through wired networks.

347
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:36,649
And there is no standardization across
these two types of networks, for

348
00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:39,729
example, to do time sensitive networking.

349
00:26:39,729 --> 00:26:39,829
for listening.

350
00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:43,869
or to provide quality of
service and so on and so forth.

351
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:48,749
Now we understand security is
paramount and so is the case

352
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:51,339
for industrial IoT systems.

353
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:58,449
The growing threat to connected devices
requires a very robust encryption and

354
00:26:58,689 --> 00:27:04,069
authentication protocols to safeguard
the sensitive data that is carried

355
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:06,819
through the network from the sensors.

356
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:14,709
Also, regulatory compliance with
standards like GDPR and ISO 27001

357
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:21,029
would require would foster the trust
and accountability of these systems.

358
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:25,189
I'll talk about some of
the future trends in IOT.

359
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:31,589
So first is on from shaped by
emerging technologies like 5g,

360
00:27:32,269 --> 00:27:34,539
digital twins, and quantum computing.

361
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:35,859
On the second.

362
00:27:36,379 --> 00:27:41,109
Aspect is the enhanced edge cloud
collaboration, which is required for

363
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,079
optimizing task allocation and requires
communication protocols to balance

364
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:49,759
computational load and minimize delays.

365
00:27:50,259 --> 00:27:55,029
The third ones are about the
advancements in privacy and security

366
00:27:55,819 --> 00:28:00,719
by protecting sensitive data and
ensuring robust authentication

367
00:28:00,729 --> 00:28:06,689
mechanisms, especially in dynamic
and heterogeneous IoT environments,

368
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:11,914
such as leveraging blockchain for
decentralized security, for example.

369
00:28:12,914 --> 00:28:17,954
This all will drive further
innovation, making IoT systems

370
00:28:17,954 --> 00:28:19,984
smarter and more resilient.

371
00:28:20,484 --> 00:28:25,624
In conclusion, real time IoT analytics
are revolutionizing industries,

372
00:28:26,394 --> 00:28:30,534
offering actionable insights, and
have a transformative potential.

373
00:28:31,034 --> 00:28:35,044
Collaboration between stakeholders
and continuous innovation are

374
00:28:35,754 --> 00:28:39,414
essential for unlocking the
full potential of IoT systems.

375
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:46,049
