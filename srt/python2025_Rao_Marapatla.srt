1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,929
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:03,200
Welcome to my talk.

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,260
Hope you guys are doing good.

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,280
Today we'll be talking about
empowering non profiting with

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,020
enterprise data warehousing.

6
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:14,449
We'll be talking about what is
data warehousing, how we can

7
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,960
empower non profits with when
you build the data warehousing.

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,990
And we'll also focus off,
solution delivery, right?

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,210
seamless donation and
program management data.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,510
Some of the predictive analytics with the
machine learning capabilities, how we can

11
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:37,160
automate data processing for consistent
results, and other important pieces,

12
00:00:37,169 --> 00:00:40,069
secure role based access management.

13
00:00:40,569 --> 00:00:42,299
Let's dive into our session.

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,519
We'll be talking about overview of
enterprise data warehousing, followed by

15
00:00:46,529 --> 00:00:48,969
some of the benefits of your organization.

16
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,369
What is enterprise data warehousing?

17
00:00:53,164 --> 00:00:58,765
A powerful centralized data ecosystem
that unifies all your organization's

18
00:00:58,765 --> 00:01:01,425
information in one secure location.

19
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:07,265
Essentially, a foundation of tracking
long term trends, measuring impact,

20
00:01:07,804 --> 00:01:10,345
and making data driven decisions.

21
00:01:11,084 --> 00:01:14,955
That is our end goal when you build
the enterprise data warehousing.

22
00:01:15,385 --> 00:01:20,004
How we can make sure our
data is so meaningful.

23
00:01:20,595 --> 00:01:22,975
And it will impact the business.

24
00:01:23,475 --> 00:01:28,595
Strategic tools that revolutionize how
nonprofits harness data to amplify their

25
00:01:28,595 --> 00:01:31,395
social mission and create lasting change.

26
00:01:31,895 --> 00:01:35,274
Let's talk about some benefits
for your organization.

27
00:01:35,974 --> 00:01:39,019
Transform manual processing
to automated workflows.

28
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,369
Saving a valuable staff
time and the resources.

29
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,229
Make confident data backed decisions
by accessing comprehensive insight

30
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:51,969
across all programs and operations.

31
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,129
Strengthen donor relationship
through data driven personalization

32
00:01:57,629 --> 00:01:59,649
and targeted engagement strategies.

33
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,529
Demonstrate your organization impact
with the precise measurement and

34
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:07,189
compelling impact to your reports.

35
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:12,459
Now let's talk about unlock the
potential of data for nonprofits.

36
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,909
So what are the stages we need if you
wanted to, unlock the potential of

37
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:21,249
data for your organization, right?

38
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,339
So we talk about the
three steps here, right?

39
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,249
One is strategic decision making, the data
automation, and empower your teams, right?

40
00:02:31,779 --> 00:02:36,729
So when you say strategy, Strategic
decision making turn complex data into

41
00:02:36,749 --> 00:02:42,829
compiling insights that guide resource
allocation, program development, and

42
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,069
impact measurements to advance your
mission with confidence and the clarity.

43
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:55,170
And the data automation eliminates
repetitive tasks and manual data entry

44
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:57,999
by building an integrated data ecosystem.

45
00:02:58,499 --> 00:03:02,379
That connects all your system,
saving hundred of step hours

46
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,259
while improving accuracy, right?

47
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:09,559
So how best you are doing the
automation of your data, right?

48
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:13,989
Like now, you are bringing some
data into some system, and some

49
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:16,699
other person is bringing the
same data from the same system.

50
00:03:17,694 --> 00:03:19,785
But a different, end goal of it, right?

51
00:03:20,054 --> 00:03:25,094
instead of that, make sure you have the
streamlined process that will, avoid

52
00:03:25,114 --> 00:03:27,125
all this, repetitive tasks, right?

53
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,045
and empower the teams.

54
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:32,225
Oh, this is one of the key area
which we need to talk about.

55
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:35,915
It's not only impact, while building
the enterprise data warehouse, but

56
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,465
it will impact overall organization.

57
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:42,675
The best you empower your
team, you will get to the more

58
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:44,785
benefits out of from the team.

59
00:03:45,495 --> 00:03:47,335
Breakdown information barriers.

60
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:53,535
And equip your teams with real time data
access, enabling them to make informed

61
00:03:53,535 --> 00:03:59,655
decision faster and focus their energy
on creating lasting social impact.

62
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:03,415
So if you focus on these three,
that definitely will help

63
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:05,300
us, to better shape our data.

64
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:10,180
In our organization now, let's
talk about some core technical

65
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,020
capabilities when you build the
enterprise data warehousing, right?

66
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,370
So let's talk about cloud based
infrastructure And the etl processing

67
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:25,170
advanced analytics engine Data governance
framework, so I am talking of these four.

68
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:30,255
the cloud based infrastructure i'm talking
now Because like now the whole world is

69
00:04:30,255 --> 00:04:32,735
moving into the cloud based system, right?

70
00:04:33,245 --> 00:04:34,645
And again, this is just
a suggestion, right?

71
00:04:34,725 --> 00:04:38,515
Like now based on your, in your
organizations and the budgets,

72
00:04:38,595 --> 00:04:41,415
we can choose whatever the
infrastructure best works for you.

73
00:04:41,775 --> 00:04:43,975
just wanted to make sure that's scalable.

74
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:50,180
Secure and ensuring 24 by 7 data
availability and also you have the

75
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,440
disaster recovery plan in place.

76
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,170
So this is some of the organizations
I like know, tend to miss the

77
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,870
discovery, disaster recovery plan.

78
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,630
But this is one of the, one of the
key element we need to consider.

79
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:10,510
Like when you have the disaster recovery
plan, so you can, sleep, You can sleep

80
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:15,120
that, you, if something goes wrong, you
got all is a plan B in place, right?

81
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,410
And when you have the data, disaster
recovery plan, make sure it's updated.

82
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,760
whatever the schedule you have
from the main product system to

83
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,690
the, recovery, instances, right?

84
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,720
And then, let's talk
about the ETL processing.

85
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,230
we're not talking about
the, any specific tools.

86
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,340
There are some tools in the market,
but whatever works for you guys, you

87
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,190
can then definitely choose those tools.

88
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,820
but ETL processing will help us.

89
00:05:40,145 --> 00:05:47,345
The data from the different sources
and, it will cleanse your data and

90
00:05:47,345 --> 00:05:54,015
it'll make sure it's proper properly
transformed with the right rules

91
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:56,605
and, eliminating all the junk data.

92
00:05:57,025 --> 00:06:03,475
and it's also helps to set the, the load
the data, With the right time, right?

93
00:06:03,475 --> 00:06:08,245
What are the time frame, you and your
organizations, works for you guys, right?

94
00:06:08,555 --> 00:06:09,925
So this will work in both ways.

95
00:06:09,965 --> 00:06:11,895
one is to bring the data, right?

96
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:16,085
And to update the data
into the periodical, right?

97
00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:21,005
So that's when the ETL processing
plays a major role, right?

98
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:24,365
And we'll also talk about SCD2,
how that will impact, right?

99
00:06:24,365 --> 00:06:26,355
And then we'll talk
about that space as well.

100
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:31,295
And then advanced analytics engine,
built in statistical analysis

101
00:06:31,345 --> 00:06:34,755
and machine learning capabilities
for predictive insights here.

102
00:06:35,055 --> 00:06:37,305
So that's what I wanted to focus here.

103
00:06:37,495 --> 00:06:42,985
so since everyone is talking about
the AI and machine learning, to

104
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,925
make that AI works better, right?

105
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,330
Our, the warehouse and the
architecture and our data should be

106
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,690
good enough so that way you will get
the, good value out of it, right?

107
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,580
if you have the bad data and if you apply
on the, the AI analytics on the top of

108
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,680
it, Technically we will get, we will
end up with, different results, right?

109
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,050
to avoid those things.

110
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:09,980
Like we need to make sure our
data is, qualified and quality and

111
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,900
other meet other aspects as well.

112
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,460
And, and another one is the
data governance framework.

113
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,225
This is also very important.

114
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:20,965
the part I would say when you're
building the enterprise data warehousing.

115
00:07:21,415 --> 00:07:23,695
So if I put it in the simple term.

116
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:26,865
Why we need the data governance, right?

117
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:31,785
Yes, you can build the enterprise
data warehousing without a data

118
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:35,965
governance framework, but having
the data governance in place, which

119
00:07:35,965 --> 00:07:42,935
means you are making sure the entire
organization is talking the same language.

120
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:47,345
Which means, for example, if
you talk about, A RIE example,

121
00:07:47,355 --> 00:07:49,025
let's say country, right?

122
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:54,335
So maybe one source bringing
data, a country, say it's

123
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:55,595
like in the United States.

124
00:07:55,935 --> 00:08:00,375
From other source, you may see
it's U. S. Another country,

125
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,435
you can see U. S. A., right?

126
00:08:02,985 --> 00:08:05,005
All these three are valid, right?

127
00:08:05,135 --> 00:08:08,535
And again, the departments also
use a different terminology.

128
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:13,585
But when the data governance
in place, so they'll make sure.

129
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:18,735
You wanted to use the USA or United
States of America or just US.

130
00:08:18,985 --> 00:08:23,095
So they will make the decision that
they'll discuss with stakeholders and make

131
00:08:23,095 --> 00:08:25,715
sure they understand why it is important.

132
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:27,325
And they will help us.

133
00:08:27,365 --> 00:08:27,775
Okay.

134
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:32,245
From now on, if country
comes in, let's use as a USA.

135
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:32,735
All right.

136
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:39,205
the organization is, finalized the naming
convention, but it's just an example,

137
00:08:39,215 --> 00:08:44,115
but we can talk a number of things,
which falls under the data governancy.

138
00:08:44,385 --> 00:08:44,665
Yeah.

139
00:08:44,705 --> 00:08:48,035
So I would say this is also one
of the important steps we need

140
00:08:48,035 --> 00:08:51,185
to consider when you are building
the enterprise data warehouse.

141
00:08:51,185 --> 00:08:54,515
Now

142
00:08:55,015 --> 00:08:58,225
let's talk about the, the
power of data integration.

143
00:08:58,835 --> 00:09:01,785
so why you wanted to
integrate your data, right?

144
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:03,415
it's really important.

145
00:09:03,655 --> 00:09:07,455
We'll talk about the step by step, but
I'd like to give you, high level overview

146
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:10,855
before we dive into the more in detail.

147
00:09:11,225 --> 00:09:13,155
So let's say in your organization.

148
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:17,275
You have data is coming
from the CRM system, right?

149
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:21,955
Most of the nonprofit organizations
in rely on a majority of the

150
00:09:21,955 --> 00:09:24,035
transactions on the CRM platform.

151
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:26,515
And you have some other
fundraising platforms.

152
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:29,795
The data is pulling from some
other, the sources, right?

153
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:34,645
And definitely you will have the finance
system in your, in every organization.

154
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:42,295
And besides that, you will also have like
HR and other security and whatnot, right?

155
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:44,095
Different, the teams, right?

156
00:09:44,135 --> 00:09:46,945
And, I would say business units
and different business units,

157
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:51,385
and they maintain the data into
the different, source systems.

158
00:09:51,785 --> 00:09:52,325
Now.

159
00:09:52,780 --> 00:10:00,350
If you don't integrate your data into
the single platform, so you got isolated

160
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,310
with your specific views, right?

161
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,750
Let's say if you're, If you are
only getting the CRM data into your,

162
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,530
any one of the database, right?

163
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:13,440
So you always end up with providing
the analytics out of that CRM data.

164
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,700
But some, in some scenario, right?

165
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,090
You want it to know the
analysis based on the CRM data

166
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,960
along with the financial data.

167
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:29,875
So then, you don't have, Option to create
or provide analytics to the management

168
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:35,295
system Combination of data is coming from
the CRM and the financial right and vice

169
00:10:35,295 --> 00:10:39,735
versa or maybe you know if you wanted
to provide The high level summarize

170
00:10:39,735 --> 00:10:44,505
over you to a senior management system
from combination of all the different

171
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:50,345
business units So if you don't have the
data integrated In a single platform,

172
00:10:50,835 --> 00:10:56,305
and it's hard to, provide, provide the
analytics to the senior, that's, I would

173
00:10:56,315 --> 00:10:58,705
say, one of the major benefit having that.

174
00:10:59,135 --> 00:11:02,685
And then if you're looking about
the another aspect, like the

175
00:11:02,685 --> 00:11:09,475
maintenance wise, or, so the single
team can maintain everything and

176
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:12,265
same template on the same platform.

177
00:11:12,325 --> 00:11:16,495
And the maintenance is easy and you'll
have that in a single tune to maintain it.

178
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:20,675
And you'll have structured data, right?

179
00:11:20,745 --> 00:11:24,805
Yeah, like that kind of, we have many
other, the benefits when you integrated

180
00:11:24,805 --> 00:11:27,035
data from the multiple systems, right?

181
00:11:27,035 --> 00:11:29,255
With that process, what we need, right?

182
00:11:29,285 --> 00:11:32,045
okay, we were talking about
the data integration, but how

183
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:33,315
are you going to do it, right?

184
00:11:33,365 --> 00:11:34,805
that is a key aspect here.

185
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,125
So what we need, right?

186
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,425
Like advanced data pipeline architecture.

187
00:11:39,695 --> 00:11:43,225
The architecture is the
key role here, right?

188
00:11:43,325 --> 00:11:47,815
The more strong your architecture
and when you build the architecture

189
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:53,890
It's worth spending More time when
you're building the architecture to

190
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:59,780
consider the 360 degree angles, right?

191
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:08,874
So that will help you to accommodate
the existing, some of the known issues.

192
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:13,335
And, the future, like now, what are the
issues we're going to end up, right?

193
00:12:13,735 --> 00:12:15,555
this is the important thing, right?

194
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:19,355
that's what my another point
saying it's scalable architecture

195
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,435
is also one of the key here.

196
00:12:21,985 --> 00:12:24,185
And secure integration protocols, right?

197
00:12:24,265 --> 00:12:27,735
Like now, how secure you are
bringing the data and making

198
00:12:27,735 --> 00:12:29,025
sure they're integrating, right?

199
00:12:29,335 --> 00:12:31,975
So that's also one of
the key aspects here.

200
00:12:32,515 --> 00:12:36,715
and, okay, you have, established
architecture, which consider

201
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:40,485
all the pros and cons and the
feature, error free system, right?

202
00:12:40,515 --> 00:12:44,925
And you have also making sure like
all the, all the secure security

203
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:46,485
integration in place, right?

204
00:12:46,495 --> 00:12:51,385
But how your data, Is going to be
the syncing in the process, right?

205
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:54,585
Like now, what time you
wanted to sync your data.

206
00:12:54,615 --> 00:13:01,585
So are you wanted to go with the 6am or
the 7am or 8am when no business coming to

207
00:13:01,585 --> 00:13:04,585
the desk, like now your data is happening.

208
00:13:04,865 --> 00:13:08,335
So this is what we need to
discuss a little bit more.

209
00:13:08,585 --> 00:13:13,605
when you set up the synchronization,
it's not just a synchronization, right?

210
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:18,405
Let's say business is asking for,
okay, I need the data every 6am, right?

211
00:13:18,885 --> 00:13:24,225
So we can set it up 6am, but we need
to focus a couple of things here.

212
00:13:24,725 --> 00:13:27,655
When exactly source
system is updating, right?

213
00:13:27,675 --> 00:13:30,935
If the source system is
updating nine o'clock, right?

214
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:36,205
But if you set up your synchronization
in 6 a. m So obviously, we will

215
00:13:36,205 --> 00:13:38,215
not have the updated data, right?

216
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:45,085
So we need to make sure and consider
both angles And explain to the business

217
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:50,595
saying that come up with a common decision
and providing the pros and cons, right?

218
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:54,305
So that is, one of the,
the synchronization, area

219
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:55,445
which we need to focus.

220
00:13:55,845 --> 00:13:58,675
And, the data quality and
the monitoring, right?

221
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:01,465
I will talk about in detail
each and every, point here.

222
00:14:01,705 --> 00:14:03,765
But yeah, so the data quality.

223
00:14:04,265 --> 00:14:08,025
Scalable architecture and
compliance management, right?

224
00:14:08,025 --> 00:14:12,785
So I would say, if you follow all
these steps So that will give us,

225
00:14:12,825 --> 00:14:18,785
you know help us to get the a place
where we have the Data, we integrated

226
00:14:18,785 --> 00:14:22,525
data in a well formed manner Okay.

227
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:26,795
So now let's talk about the building
a robust data warehouse, right?

228
00:14:27,495 --> 00:14:31,155
So I would again call it about
the, four pillars here, right?

229
00:14:31,415 --> 00:14:35,775
Data integration, data quality,
data modeling, and data

230
00:14:35,785 --> 00:14:37,345
analysis and visualization.

231
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:40,155
So data integrations,
as we discussed, right?

232
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:41,635
Like we need to follow all that.

233
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,445
which we discussed, right?

234
00:14:44,745 --> 00:14:49,845
And the data quality, implement,
validation rules and automated

235
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:54,955
cleansing workflow that catch errors
before they impact your decisions.

236
00:14:55,565 --> 00:15:00,565
Our systematic approaches ensure your data
remains, pristine, liable, And they're

237
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:06,375
ready to drive meaningful action across
your organization and the data modeling.

238
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:10,835
This is really, the important,
one of the important part

239
00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:12,745
which will play a major role.

240
00:15:12,805 --> 00:15:17,385
So whoever is building the data model,
like normally people use like in the

241
00:15:17,385 --> 00:15:22,075
data model also will call it is and we
have the couple of tools offered to build

242
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:28,065
the data modeling, but which are tool
which we are, which you are opting right?

243
00:15:28,355 --> 00:15:33,095
Make sure our the large scale
physical data model in place.

244
00:15:33,355 --> 00:15:37,415
And, so when you see the logical,
so you'll have all the table, And

245
00:15:37,425 --> 00:15:42,295
how they establish the relation
between each tables and what is the

246
00:15:42,295 --> 00:15:44,965
dependency and how they're related.

247
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:51,245
So the clear logical structure has to be
there and it has to run by, respective

248
00:15:51,245 --> 00:15:56,595
teams, And then followed by, we need to
build the, A physical data model, which

249
00:15:56,895 --> 00:15:59,795
will give you even more detail, right?

250
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:01,915
what is the table, right?

251
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:05,715
which table contains what kind
of elements, what are the primary

252
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:09,555
and foreign keys, and what is
the relationship between them?

253
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,385
What kind of data each table holds?

254
00:16:12,425 --> 00:16:19,580
So this, two documents are really
key aspects to move forward To build

255
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,290
the enterprise data warehousing.

256
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,760
So again, like now, make sure we need,
we have captured this step and we

257
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:30,700
followed without missing it because
this is a step which we are going

258
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,040
to use as a future reference, right?

259
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,080
Like now if something
you wanted to see it.

260
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:39,010
So we, this is a place where
we are going to, in a reference

261
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,930
as a master copy, right?

262
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,890
And, and data analysis and visualization.

263
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:50,350
As everyone knows, our end goal is
to provide a best visualization,

264
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,760
with a, with a data analysis, right?

265
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:58,440
Um, so that way that meaningful
analysis, when, the, when the

266
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,290
management is saying they can take.

267
00:17:00,475 --> 00:17:04,925
the informed decisions, based out of the
visualization, which we provided, right?

268
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:07,935
That's when our, we achieved
our end goal, right?

269
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:11,015
Just having the enterprise data
warehousing, and if you're not

270
00:17:11,065 --> 00:17:15,505
providing any, analytics, Our
visualizations to remain as main.

271
00:17:15,845 --> 00:17:18,995
that, that might be, the different
way of looking into it, right?

272
00:17:19,475 --> 00:17:23,965
So how best, we can provide the
visualization side, like now operational

273
00:17:23,965 --> 00:17:26,635
reports and, analytical reports.

274
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:29,035
So operational versus
analytical reports, right?

275
00:17:29,035 --> 00:17:31,105
You can talk about, operational, report.

276
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,020
Reporting means, the reports
which business is looking for

277
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,260
near real time data, right?

278
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:41,370
And, when you're looking for analytics,
like now it's, it's you can set the rules,

279
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:46,480
whether it's the T minus one day data or
T minus two day data, based on, again,

280
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,240
your source system, how, you set up the
scheduling and how that works, right?

281
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,830
now, let's talk about
the data quality, right?

282
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,600
this is one of the key, I personally,
I like it because what I believe

283
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:04,315
here, no matter, how, The best
reporting visualizations, right?

284
00:18:04,315 --> 00:18:08,765
Or no matter how big volume of data
you are, giving to your management.

285
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:15,215
If the data is not accurate, if the data
is not quality enough, so obviously,

286
00:18:15,215 --> 00:18:17,475
it will lead to in other directions.

287
00:18:17,485 --> 00:18:22,015
so that is the reason we wanted
to make sure what are the data we

288
00:18:22,015 --> 00:18:23,835
are bringing into our warehouse.

289
00:18:24,585 --> 00:18:30,325
It should be, quality enough and to
do that, you just need to ensure all

290
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:32,265
the steps we have forwarded, right?

291
00:18:32,785 --> 00:18:36,935
Smart Data Validation, like we have
different ways of validating it, right?

292
00:18:36,935 --> 00:18:41,225
So you need to connect to the Smart
Data Validation, Real time Quality

293
00:18:41,225 --> 00:18:46,455
Monitoring, Clear Data Standards,
Advanced Data Profiling, Automated

294
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:51,235
Cleansing Workflow, and Data
Governance Framework in place, right?

295
00:18:51,555 --> 00:18:56,065
So when you follow, this, the six
steps, and make sure in each stage,

296
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:59,755
you have, You have set the right
rules and you have validated and

297
00:18:59,775 --> 00:19:01,895
everything and executed well, right?

298
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:07,475
So that's when you will get that quality
of the data in your warehouse along

299
00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:10,605
with the, the data governance framework.

300
00:19:11,105 --> 00:19:15,195
Now let's talk about the data modeling,
uncovering actionable insights.

301
00:19:15,695 --> 00:19:17,045
As we talked about, right?

302
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,035
we divided it into two parts, right?

303
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:21,375
the large scale data model
and the physical model.

304
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:22,035
Okay.

305
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:23,645
the donor segmentation, right?

306
00:19:23,685 --> 00:19:26,005
We wanted to segment
different level right here.

307
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:31,145
So create dynamic donor, persons using
advanced clustering analysis that

308
00:19:31,145 --> 00:19:35,485
combine giving patterns, engagement
metrics, and demographic data to

309
00:19:35,485 --> 00:19:37,485
deliver hyper personalized outcomes.

310
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:41,615
Outreach that increases
donor retention by up to 30%.

311
00:19:42,045 --> 00:19:46,385
And then, the next step, program
performance analysis, and operational

312
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:50,505
efficiency tracking, and predictive
analytics integration, and

313
00:19:50,575 --> 00:19:52,415
multidimensional data modeling.

314
00:19:52,415 --> 00:19:56,426
to consider all these, we need to
build this, multidimensional data

315
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:01,770
modeling before we, start to build,
the enterprise data warehousing.

316
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:05,120
Now let's talk about the data
analysis and visualization.

317
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,800
this is the driving informed decision
making right, as we mentioned before.

318
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,140
So how this is gonna work, right?

319
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,580
Strateg decision intelligence.

320
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:18,140
And donor relations cultivation,
real time analytics integration,

321
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:23,090
operational performance optimizations,
interactive visualization tools.

322
00:20:23,475 --> 00:20:25,675
Custom reporting framework, right?

323
00:20:25,765 --> 00:20:31,135
so that based on the reports which
we provide based on the data in

324
00:20:31,135 --> 00:20:35,645
our warehouse, that's when, try a
strategy decisions in, decisions,

325
00:20:35,665 --> 00:20:37,405
simply, make the decisions here.

326
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:40,645
And this will also help to know
donor relationship cultivation.

327
00:20:40,675 --> 00:20:44,645
So based on the visualizations
of the best of the data, which

328
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:46,005
we provided to the management.

329
00:20:46,335 --> 00:20:49,145
So they will analyze, how the
donor, cultivation is, is working.

330
00:20:49,235 --> 00:20:49,255
Yeah.

331
00:20:50,005 --> 00:20:54,848
And yeah, real time analytics integration,
implement real time analytics capabilities

332
00:20:54,848 --> 00:20:59,655
with automated data refresh pipelines,
enabling, immediate insights and

333
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,135
rapid response to changing conditions.

334
00:21:02,185 --> 00:21:03,985
through live monitoring dashboards.

335
00:21:04,315 --> 00:21:07,905
So this is what we were talking about, the
operational, the reporting system, right?

336
00:21:08,165 --> 00:21:13,035
So we need to build and our warehouse
should be sustainable to provide

337
00:21:13,045 --> 00:21:14,085
the real time data warehousing.

338
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:17,335
So again, like this
will work case by case.

339
00:21:17,365 --> 00:21:21,695
Um, so your source and your, the ETL.

340
00:21:21,955 --> 00:21:26,405
And, your, your job, your jobs
and, your reporting, what are the

341
00:21:26,405 --> 00:21:27,695
reporting systems you're using?

342
00:21:28,025 --> 00:21:32,305
we need to align in the same
place in order to provide the

343
00:21:32,305 --> 00:21:33,915
real time analytics, right?

344
00:21:34,165 --> 00:21:37,355
So it's not that easy, when we say
the real time data analytics, we

345
00:21:37,355 --> 00:21:40,825
even want to get it, like, when you
plug in from source to, warehouse

346
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,315
and from the reporting, right?

347
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,095
So some reportings
work, the different way.

348
00:21:45,495 --> 00:21:48,035
And some reports are working
in a different way, right?

349
00:21:48,535 --> 00:21:52,045
Compared to the live connection
versus the extract connection.

350
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:55,545
So we need to make, smarter
decisions, based on the business

351
00:21:55,545 --> 00:21:58,701
needs, like when the business is
asked for the real time analytics.

352
00:21:58,701 --> 00:22:00,910
But, I haven't said, providing
real time analytics is not enough.

353
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:07,660
Is the key for any organization to take
informed decisions and on the fly, right?

354
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,190
Interactive visualizations, like
definitely that will gonna, the game

355
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:16,810
changer, like when you provide interactive
visualizations, like which means so when

356
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:19,130
I said interactive analysis means, right?

357
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:23,610
So when you click on, maybe, The map,
for instance, if you consider the

358
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,970
map, the US map having all the states.

359
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:31,100
So when you click on maybe New Jersey or
New York, like now you're going to see,

360
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,140
same, the state related entire information
followed by just one or two click,

361
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,420
based on the interaction, how we set up.

362
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:42,930
And then, having that custom reporting
framework, this will also helpful,

363
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:47,630
for any organization to set up the
template so that, we can follow the same

364
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,430
template for across the organization.

365
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:55,150
So these are all the steps will help us
to, provide the best analytics platform.

366
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,860
Now, transforming operations and
automation and collaboration, right?

367
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:04,330
Automated reporting, real time
analytics, cross department

368
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,060
collaborations, advanced integration hub.

369
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,110
And a predictive analytics engine.

370
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:14,530
So this all will help us, to
place where we, provide the, all

371
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:18,400
the automation, with the help of
all this collaborations, right?

372
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,300
So that's when we are going to, provide
a complete, And two and a hundred

373
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,910
percent automated, the analytics, based
on the cost department operations,

374
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:32,210
setting up the real time and I'll
take setting up the, automated systems

375
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,590
in entire, end to end flow, right?

376
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,680
so that will really help us, to
provide the transform operations.

377
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,460
Now, let's talk about
some case studies, right?

378
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,800
Outcomes of how that world
is successing these stories.

379
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,250
So implementing the enterprise
data warehousing, right?

380
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,520
so yeah, these are the some
statistics which I collected, right?

381
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,750
example of non profit
leveraging AWS, right?

382
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,160
Boost fundraising success.

383
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,600
So that way, that's when you can,
boost your fundraising, right?

384
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:04,420
And improve transparency and
accountability with automated reporting.

385
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:10,040
Align strategy goals with the
mission impact and achieve 60 percent

386
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,980
reduction in data processing time.

387
00:24:12,165 --> 00:24:17,095
implement real time cross platform data
integration, enhanced data security,

388
00:24:17,135 --> 00:24:19,375
and compliance framework, right?

389
00:24:20,015 --> 00:24:23,645
So discover how enterprise data
warehousing or your evaluation non

390
00:24:23,645 --> 00:24:28,075
profit operations, enabling organizations
to unlock valuable insights.

391
00:24:28,555 --> 00:24:33,555
Boost efficiency and accelerated
social impact across, critical sectors.

392
00:24:33,955 --> 00:24:37,745
So this is a real, this world example
demonstrate the transforming power

393
00:24:37,745 --> 00:24:39,695
of, strategic data integration.

394
00:24:40,155 --> 00:24:43,745
So each case study tells a
story of, innovation, right?

395
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:44,075
Yeah.

396
00:24:44,445 --> 00:24:47,765
highlighting how nonprofits
have leveraged data to enhance

397
00:24:48,165 --> 00:24:52,505
organizational performance, optimizing
resource allocation, and create a

398
00:24:52,505 --> 00:24:54,735
measurable, lasting, community impact.

399
00:24:55,335 --> 00:24:59,185
Through modern ETL process, a
cloud based architecture and

400
00:24:59,205 --> 00:25:01,085
advanced analytics capabilities.

401
00:25:01,095 --> 00:25:06,105
These organizations have transformed
their technical infrastructures while

402
00:25:06,165 --> 00:25:09,015
maintaining focus on their core missions.

403
00:25:09,515 --> 00:25:13,595
Now, let's talk about the building
a data driven future for nonprofits.

404
00:25:13,905 --> 00:25:16,085
So increase fundraising success.

405
00:25:16,135 --> 00:25:16,815
that's what.

406
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:21,320
our end goal at how we can increase
our fundraising success, right?

407
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,990
And improve transparency and
accountability and the strategic

408
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:30,530
alignment impact on scalable data
infrastructure, advanced analytics,

409
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,840
integration and automated data governance.

410
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:36,845
So it, Increased
fundraising success, right?

411
00:25:36,845 --> 00:25:39,025
So let's talk about this,
how this is going to help.

412
00:25:39,285 --> 00:25:43,475
So data driven fundraising strategies
enables nonprofits to personalize

413
00:25:43,525 --> 00:25:49,005
appeal, identify potential donors, and
optimize campaign performance, right?

414
00:25:49,185 --> 00:25:53,515
Based on all these steps, we can
increase our fundraising success, right?

415
00:25:53,515 --> 00:25:56,535
How we can measure the
fundraising success.

416
00:25:57,035 --> 00:25:59,695
And improve transparency
and accountability.

417
00:25:59,955 --> 00:26:03,985
EDWs enhance transparency by
providing clear and consistency data

418
00:26:03,985 --> 00:26:08,595
about donor contribution, program
outcomes, and financial performances.

419
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:12,035
And, strategic alignment and impact.

420
00:26:12,095 --> 00:26:17,070
data driven insights enable nonprofits
to align their program and initiatives

421
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,085
with their strategic goals.

422
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:22,500
Maximize their impact and
achieving their mission.

423
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:27,440
now, let's talk about scalable data
infrastructure, as we discussed it, right?

424
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,820
your data infrastructure has
to be scalable enough, right?

425
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:34,695
Having 24 by 7 data up and
running and you have the latest

426
00:26:34,695 --> 00:26:36,450
recovery plan in place, right?

427
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:40,060
So we need to consider the cost
of maintain and cost of engine

428
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,470
and the performance, right?

429
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,550
And advanced analytics integration, right?

430
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,250
A built in analytics capabilities
enable predictive modeling,

431
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:52,170
mission learning, and the real time
reporting for data driven decisions

432
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,610
making, automated data governance.

433
00:26:55,270 --> 00:27:00,360
It's a robust data governance framework,
ensure data quality, security,

434
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:04,670
and compliance with the regulatory
requirement across all the system.

435
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:08,980
Now let's start with some of the
challenges in, when you're implementing

436
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,740
the enterprise data warehousing.

437
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,210
the complex system integration
requiring specialized expert expertise

438
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,830
to connect to multiple data sources.

439
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,770
As we discussed at
lifecycle, it's not just.

440
00:27:19,035 --> 00:27:21,515
inter level people, can,
plug and play, right?

441
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:28,065
So we need to understand like, 360
degrees, of the user needs and existing

442
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:32,995
systems, the technologies we use,
all these things, time consuming

443
00:27:32,995 --> 00:27:37,415
data, creating and transformation to
maintain the quality across the system.

444
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:42,370
Organizational assistancy to
new data systems, acquiring,

445
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,870
training, and change management.

446
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,540
We never know, right?

447
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,870
let's say today we have
four systems in place.

448
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:56,010
Tomorrow we may have one more system which
may be onboarded into our organization.

449
00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:01,090
So we need to make sure we need to
consider the future systems as well.

450
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,320
All right.

451
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:07,100
To ongoing commitment to governance,
including security updates and compliance.

452
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:11,720
Performance and scalability
challenges a data volume grow, right?

453
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,700
So when you are building the data
warehousing, so your data value

454
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,130
may be, one terabyte, right?

455
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:23,800
You never know, that may grow, like
maybe, 5 TB or the 10 DB, right?

456
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:27,840
We just need to make sure, at least
you plan for the next, five years

457
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:31,910
with a predictive analysis, like
how our data is going to be and

458
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:34,120
where we are going to land, right?

459
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,020
Based on that, you can build your,
the entire, infrastructure, right?

460
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:41,990
the technical capability issues between
different platforms and interface, right?

461
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,605
When you're building it.

462
00:28:42,915 --> 00:28:45,315
When we are dealing with
the different platforms.

463
00:28:45,605 --> 00:28:48,245
So what are the technical
capabilities we may end up, right?

464
00:28:48,245 --> 00:28:52,795
So we need to well document and
prepare for that, security and privacy

465
00:28:52,795 --> 00:28:56,015
risks when handling sensitive data
across the jurisdiction, right?

466
00:28:56,175 --> 00:29:01,435
This is a very, a key aspect, which we
need to consider and making sure in all

467
00:29:01,435 --> 00:29:06,285
the security privacy risks, which we are
handled and we manage the data, right?

468
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:06,995
bear.

469
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:13,425
Based on the different environments,
and use your masking, how you are going

470
00:29:13,425 --> 00:29:15,625
to handle the masking the data, right?

471
00:29:15,635 --> 00:29:20,685
When you have the, the sensitive
data in your warehouse, right?

472
00:29:20,685 --> 00:29:26,885
So we need to set up the rules based
on the data, making sure we follow the

473
00:29:26,895 --> 00:29:29,275
security and the privacy risks, right?

474
00:29:30,115 --> 00:29:35,645
Now, next, next steps to implement and
since we learned, some of the steps, how.

475
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,120
We can implement the
enterprise data warehousing.

476
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,700
So you need to have the defi, you
need to have the clear objective

477
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:48,050
and the right teams and the right
technologies and the project plan, right?

478
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:48,270
Yeah.

479
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:51,170
So we're going to talk
about those things here.

480
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,670
So define clear objectives
and success metrics aligned

481
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,130
with your nonprofit mission.

482
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:02,350
For my cross functional implementation
And this is current data landscape, right?

483
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:07,290
And what is going to be, our,
data volume like over the period,

484
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,840
based on the existing data, right?

485
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,440
We can do some, predictive analytics
based on the existing data.

486
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,600
So that, at least we know where we're
going to land next, five or 10 years.

487
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:16,920
yeah.

488
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:21,240
And, select and configure, an
appropriate data solution that

489
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,650
fits into your needs and budget.

490
00:30:24,085 --> 00:30:26,115
Yeah, means the tools, right?

491
00:30:26,145 --> 00:30:27,855
the teams, how they want to work.

492
00:30:28,235 --> 00:30:31,505
So based on their needs right now,
that's when you need to, we need

493
00:30:31,505 --> 00:30:33,155
to focus some of the areas here.

494
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:37,065
So develop comprehensive implementation
plan, including timeline,

495
00:30:37,095 --> 00:30:38,615
resource and risk management.

496
00:30:38,675 --> 00:30:42,025
so this is when, when you showcase
to the management, so you're going

497
00:30:42,025 --> 00:30:46,275
with, the clear directions and the
timeline saying that, Hey, this is what

498
00:30:46,275 --> 00:30:47,865
we are, like where we are right now.

499
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,480
And when you're implementing the EDW,
what we are going to achieve, right?

500
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:56,230
why we need to invest, so much
of money into the enterprise

501
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,320
data warehousing, right?

502
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:59,900
it's not just not benefit
like one thing, right?

503
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,725
you need to, Prepare that plan.

504
00:31:01,725 --> 00:31:03,125
What are the teams you need?

505
00:31:03,145 --> 00:31:04,455
what are the skills that you need?

506
00:31:04,455 --> 00:31:06,005
What are the technologies you need?

507
00:31:06,295 --> 00:31:10,065
If you don't have already in your,
in our organization side, that is a

508
00:31:10,095 --> 00:31:15,445
prep work, which we need to, have it
before, we present this decision and

509
00:31:15,445 --> 00:31:19,225
build secure data pipeline with proper
validation and the quality controls.

510
00:31:19,725 --> 00:31:23,878
so that's when the secure pipeline
and the quality controls, right?

511
00:31:23,878 --> 00:31:26,685
Like when you implement like now, when
if you wanted to build the historical

512
00:31:27,055 --> 00:31:29,491
data, you need to implement SCD2, right?

513
00:31:29,491 --> 00:31:34,575
when I say SCD2, it is one of the,
the concept where you maintain the

514
00:31:34,575 --> 00:31:39,165
current history data, in, you call
it as a, we call it as a slowly

515
00:31:39,175 --> 00:31:41,525
changing dimension type 2, right?

516
00:31:42,115 --> 00:31:44,255
uh, SCV2 that is we call it.

517
00:31:44,315 --> 00:31:44,535
Yeah.

518
00:31:44,715 --> 00:31:47,865
So we need to make sure, we
call it the same and which will

519
00:31:47,915 --> 00:31:49,465
maintain the current history.

520
00:31:49,525 --> 00:31:54,425
that is one of the key aspects to
maintain your enterprise data warehousing.

521
00:31:55,085 --> 00:31:57,425
Then launch staff training
program to ensure effective

522
00:31:57,465 --> 00:31:59,645
system adoption and utilization.

523
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:02,995
So this again, like once we are
done, implement the solution.

524
00:32:03,285 --> 00:32:07,335
So we need to have the staff
training program to ensure, system

525
00:32:07,335 --> 00:32:12,165
is adopted and it is usable and
everyone is benefiting out of it.

526
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:12,865
Yeah.

527
00:32:13,275 --> 00:32:17,075
So when you have all this plan
in your place and you can move

528
00:32:17,095 --> 00:32:20,285
forward and again, so this is.

529
00:32:20,615 --> 00:32:24,535
All the steps in which, which I
came across, in my journey, right?

530
00:32:24,865 --> 00:32:29,485
You may need to tweak, based on your
organization needs and based on your,

531
00:32:29,485 --> 00:32:33,405
organization budget, based on your,
organization, the data volume, and the

532
00:32:33,405 --> 00:32:35,685
technologies and the resources, right?

533
00:32:35,725 --> 00:32:40,665
But, primarily, if you follow, the
steps which we discussed, definitely

534
00:32:40,685 --> 00:32:45,095
you gonna have the, really, a
secure, Cleanse, quality, data in

535
00:32:45,105 --> 00:32:50,205
your enterprise data warehousing and
business will definitely benefit out of,

536
00:32:50,475 --> 00:32:53,945
bringing the data from the enterprise
data warehousing as a, operational

537
00:32:54,165 --> 00:32:56,385
and, analytics reporting system.

538
00:32:56,885 --> 00:32:59,715
With that, thank you so
much for, joining my talk.

539
00:32:59,755 --> 00:33:01,325
I hope, you learned something.

540
00:33:01,435 --> 00:33:03,885
hope to see you, in some other time.

541
00:33:04,285 --> 00:33:04,935
Thank you all.

542
00:33:05,435 --> 00:33:06,285
Thank you so much.
