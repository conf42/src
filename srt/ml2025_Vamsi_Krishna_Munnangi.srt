1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,009
Hey.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,940
Hi everybody.

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,750
Welcome to conference 42,
machine Learning 2025.

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,370
My name is V Kushner and I work
as a senior software engineer at

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,890
Walmart, where a primary work.

6
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:20,280
In infrastructure engineering today, I am
honored to speak on a transformative shift

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,350
that's occurring in cloud ecosystems.

8
00:00:22,799 --> 00:00:28,350
That is the journey from reactive
to predictive with AI driven API

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,540
resiliency in cloud ecosystems.

10
00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:38,129
Imagine a world where your
APIs don't just react.

11
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:40,795
To failures, but predict and prevent them.

12
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:43,345
Thus, the power of AI driven resilience.

13
00:00:44,275 --> 00:00:47,995
APIs are critical business assets.

14
00:00:48,055 --> 00:00:51,925
Any downtime can lead to lost
revenue, diminished customer

15
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:53,725
trust, and operational chaos.

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:53,790
Okay.

17
00:00:54,389 --> 00:01:00,089
Moving from reactive to proactive
stance is no longer just beneficial.

18
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:01,650
It's essential,

19
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:10,979
the API management landscape in today's
microservices architecture driven world.

20
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,240
The following statistics highlight
the immense scale at which these

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,695
architectures are being adopted.

22
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,050
By 2032, the API Management
market is projected to reach a

23
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:27,600
staggering 27.3 billion US dollars,
highlighting how crucial APIs

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,310
have become to business success.

25
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,830
Companies that integrate AI into
their API Management strategies

26
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:41,355
experience substantial gains,
which includes 34.7% fewer errors.

27
00:01:42,045 --> 00:01:50,865
28.5 percentage faster response times,
and that's clearly AI is becoming

28
00:01:50,895 --> 00:01:55,515
an indispensable partner in ensuring
API performance and reliability.

29
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:57,705
Moving on.

30
00:01:57,705 --> 00:02:01,335
Next, we have three main
pillars of API, resilience.

31
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:07,214
To transition effectively from a
reactive to a predictive approach.

32
00:02:07,755 --> 00:02:13,305
The three pillars of API resilience
are critical, intelligent optimization,

33
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:18,734
which is nothing but dynamically
managing performance using ai, where

34
00:02:18,734 --> 00:02:23,325
advanced AI algorithms that dynamically
tune performance, balance the

35
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:27,584
traffic loads and allocate resources
based on real time demand patterns.

36
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,525
The preemptive security.

37
00:02:31,245 --> 00:02:36,165
Security plays an important role in
microservices, proactively detecting

38
00:02:36,165 --> 00:02:40,665
threats before the A escalate rather
than reacting after an incident.

39
00:02:41,355 --> 00:02:46,245
This involves advanced threat
intelligence that uncovers potential

40
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:51,644
vulnerabilities early and integrating
behavior analysis with context

41
00:02:51,644 --> 00:02:53,085
error authentication mechanisms.

42
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,760
And autonomous healing autonom
automatically predicting, detecting

43
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,340
and fixing before they even escalate.

44
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,200
So the intelligence systems that
continuously monitor predict potential

45
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,370
failure points and automatically
implement corrective measures

46
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,730
before service disruption occurs.

47
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,770
And now we have intelligent
optimization in action.

48
00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:21,165
How does it happen?

49
00:03:21,315 --> 00:03:25,905
Imagine an API gateway that can
dynamically scale to process

50
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,454
3,500 requests per second.

51
00:03:28,515 --> 00:03:31,575
That is 3,500 requests.

52
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:37,864
35 TPS achieving a 67 percentage
increase in throughput with

53
00:03:37,864 --> 00:03:39,515
the no drop in performance.

54
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:42,785
And that's the key point, and
that's such a huge reduction in

55
00:03:42,785 --> 00:03:46,864
processing, time of request, and
handling large loads of requests.

56
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:54,500
User experience is the most essential part
of a successful journey for any product.

57
00:03:54,829 --> 00:04:00,380
We need to have AI deep learning
algorithms balance load intelligently

58
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:06,440
achieving 25% lower latency during
high traffic scenarios, ensuring

59
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,230
consistent, usual per experience,

60
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:13,640
the reinforcement learning based caching.

61
00:04:13,925 --> 00:04:19,355
Predicts frequently assessed content,
reducing the database load by an

62
00:04:19,355 --> 00:04:26,315
impressive 35% that can be devoted towards
CDNs or any cash enabled in the workflow.

63
00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:32,315
And let's move ahead and check the
What's preemptive security framework is?

64
00:04:33,485 --> 00:04:37,594
Traditional security models wait
for an attack to happen so that

65
00:04:38,585 --> 00:04:39,905
there needs to be prevented.

66
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:45,725
With AI driven preventive security,
the narrative changes drastically.

67
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:51,090
Continuous monitoring, real
time monitoring analysis.

68
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,159
1 million security events per second.

69
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,479
So guys, just imagine 1 million
security events, and that's a

70
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:04,109
lot enabling instantaneous threat
identification, a powered contextual

71
00:05:04,109 --> 00:05:11,280
authentication cuts, unauthorized
access attempts by up to 73% through

72
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,799
behavioral and environmental analysis.

73
00:05:14,974 --> 00:05:19,534
Predictive threat detection improves
incident recognition, speed by

74
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:25,594
58%, dramatically reducing the
likelihood of a successful attacks,

75
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:29,039
and then comes the self
feeling architecture.

76
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,599
We just don't anticipate problems in here.

77
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,240
We fix them proactively.

78
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,599
We have baseline models.

79
00:05:37,485 --> 00:05:40,965
Which analyze 50 K events per second.

80
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:46,095
Learning what normal looks like when we
say normal is the ideal system behavior.

81
00:05:46,785 --> 00:05:52,425
So the early warning system detects 30
minutes before the conventional tools.

82
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:57,195
Autonomous recovery capabilities can
deploy solutions in milliseconds,

83
00:05:57,645 --> 00:06:01,575
ensuring minimal D time and
seamless user experiences.

84
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:04,360
And again, I want to emphasize on this.

85
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:12,420
Point, user experience is very important
for any company success, and these

86
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,880
are the downtime reduction results.

87
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:20,610
Traditional ai enhanced predictive
versus autonomous, and this graph.

88
00:06:22,185 --> 00:06:26,670
It clearly proves a point that you
know how moving to autonomous helps

89
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:31,620
us in reducing the down downtime
in any system or any applications.

90
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,510
So what is autonomous incident resolution?

91
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,800
Advanced algorithms autonomously
detect and resolve incidents that

92
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,325
humans might overlook, and that's
always a possibility with machines.

93
00:06:46,135 --> 00:06:50,905
They own overlook, and that's why we
train the systems with the historical

94
00:06:50,905 --> 00:06:53,005
data to help understand the system.

95
00:06:54,085 --> 00:07:00,655
AI based incident detection rapidly
identifies subtle, anonymous, advanced

96
00:07:00,685 --> 00:07:06,085
algorithms identify subtle, an anatomy
patterns invisible to human operators,

97
00:07:06,865 --> 00:07:12,625
instant root cause analysis across
distributed systems, instant maps, and.

98
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,520
Analyzes complex system dependencies
across distributed environments.

99
00:07:18,615 --> 00:07:25,305
Automated resolutions successfully handle
70% of the critical incidents, slashing

100
00:07:25,305 --> 00:07:28,785
the meantime to resolution by 85%.

101
00:07:28,995 --> 00:07:33,315
And that's the most important criteria
or the statistics that the operational

102
00:07:33,315 --> 00:07:36,765
Excellency team is proud of when it's low.

103
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:43,285
So in AI world it's all
about continuous learning.

104
00:07:43,345 --> 00:07:45,595
So what happens in this
continuous learning.

105
00:07:46,555 --> 00:07:51,784
There is a point for our systems
to have more data points, help

106
00:07:51,994 --> 00:07:53,854
understand the system even better.

107
00:07:54,484 --> 00:07:58,835
So the AI systems continuously learn
and improve, creating a robust,

108
00:07:59,674 --> 00:08:01,864
ever evolving defense mechanism.

109
00:08:02,585 --> 00:08:06,185
Historical in incident analysis
provides actionable insights.

110
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,080
Systematically mine the past insights
to extract actionable intelligence

111
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,090
and optimization patterns.

112
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:20,540
This always helps in bettering operational
efficiency and system reliability.

113
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:28,070
Predictive models are refined,
constantly achieving 12 to 15% in a

114
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:33,049
quarterly improvement basis whenever
the incident response effectiveness.

115
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:35,299
Okay.

116
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:40,085
Enhance the predictive models with
real world data so that they create

117
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:42,545
more precise response Frameworks.

118
00:08:42,635 --> 00:08:47,194
Train the system with previous
incidents so that the incidents are

119
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:52,264
fine tuned over the period, which
aids to smooth system running.

120
00:08:54,004 --> 00:08:58,984
Continuous knowledge expansion
enhances long-term API Resilience.

121
00:08:59,615 --> 00:09:04,385
Making your cloud ecosystem
smarter, more resilient over time.

122
00:09:05,224 --> 00:09:12,994
Continuously enha enrich the incident
databases and solution repositories to

123
00:09:12,994 --> 00:09:15,935
strengthen future response capabilities.

124
00:09:15,994 --> 00:09:20,285
It's all about the learning and how
do we apply on the future instance.

125
00:09:20,315 --> 00:09:23,135
That's all the AI is all about to train.

126
00:09:24,694 --> 00:09:27,875
And how do we implement What
is the implementation roadmap?

127
00:09:28,085 --> 00:09:32,014
So adopting to predictive a PR resilience
requires a structured approach.

128
00:09:32,014 --> 00:09:33,575
It cannot happen overnight.

129
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:38,855
So the most important phase is
the assessment and the planning.

130
00:09:38,855 --> 00:09:43,055
So we have to evaluate the
existing infrastructure and

131
00:09:43,055 --> 00:09:44,524
identify the weaknesses.

132
00:09:44,974 --> 00:09:48,034
Conduct comprehensive API
infrastructure analysis.

133
00:09:48,665 --> 00:09:54,785
Identify the critical resilience,
vulnerabilities, and capability gaps.

134
00:09:55,145 --> 00:10:00,935
Establish clear quantifiable objectives
with stakeholder agreement alignments.

135
00:10:01,984 --> 00:10:09,155
And then comes the pilot deployment as a
responsible engineer using microservices.

136
00:10:09,454 --> 00:10:14,734
In today's world, we have to deploy
them on a cannery deployment techniques,

137
00:10:14,764 --> 00:10:18,605
like there are various techniques,
but this is one of the most used

138
00:10:18,905 --> 00:10:20,524
techniques for any deployment.

139
00:10:21,665 --> 00:10:24,484
So deploy AI solutions to
non-critical a PS first.

140
00:10:25,474 --> 00:10:30,635
To refine the modules and then launch
AI powered monitoring solutions on

141
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:32,734
these selected non-critical APIs.

142
00:10:33,514 --> 00:10:38,105
Established performance baselines
and detection thresholds, validate

143
00:10:38,915 --> 00:10:42,935
the prediction accuracy against
these real world incidents.

144
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:46,625
And once these are done, we'll
move on to the full integration.

145
00:10:47,075 --> 00:10:51,305
So when I say full integration,
we gradually expand the AI driven

146
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:53,345
resilience across all APIs.

147
00:10:53,825 --> 00:10:58,115
Ensuring seamless integration
with existing tool happens,

148
00:10:58,744 --> 00:11:03,244
expand the implementation across
production environment seamlessly.

149
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:06,484
Connect with existing monitoring
and management systems.

150
00:11:07,325 --> 00:11:15,425
Develop and execute targeted technical
team training programs, and always

151
00:11:15,454 --> 00:11:19,865
make sure to have a backup plans ready
just in case if anything needs to be

152
00:11:19,865 --> 00:11:22,264
corrected or needs to be put back.

153
00:11:23,075 --> 00:11:29,704
In these unforeseen circumstances,
so continuous optimization, enhanced

154
00:11:29,704 --> 00:11:33,785
prediction modules using real
operational data and measure the return

155
00:11:33,785 --> 00:11:40,175
on investment in downtime reduction,
and also in the improved reliability

156
00:11:40,175 --> 00:11:45,305
on the system progressively expand
autonomous response capabilities.

157
00:11:47,585 --> 00:11:53,105
So by now, we should be able to define
the next steps in our organization.

158
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:57,035
And how do we practically
begin this journey towards

159
00:11:57,035 --> 00:11:58,895
this predictive API resilience?

160
00:11:59,405 --> 00:12:04,265
Assess your current resilience
maturity, understand your baseline,

161
00:12:04,444 --> 00:12:10,145
identify the critical APIs, evaluate
your API ecosystems resilience level.

162
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:13,865
Identify critical services
requiring the highest availability.

163
00:12:15,545 --> 00:12:20,045
And always start small scale
fast, and that's the mantra.

164
00:12:20,405 --> 00:12:26,014
Always remember that even thousand miles
of journey starts with a single step.

165
00:12:26,524 --> 00:12:30,425
Incrementally integrate predictive
capabilities, starting with

166
00:12:30,425 --> 00:12:32,830
analytics and expanding step by step.

167
00:12:33,694 --> 00:12:36,095
Begin with monitoring and analytics.

168
00:12:36,635 --> 00:12:43,024
Add predictive capabilities, incrementally
measure improvements systematically.

169
00:12:44,585 --> 00:12:46,685
So build cross-functional teams.

170
00:12:47,435 --> 00:12:53,135
So combine expertise from API
developers, machine learning specialists

171
00:12:53,165 --> 00:12:56,585
and site reliability engineers
