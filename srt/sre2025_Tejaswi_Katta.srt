1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:03,450
Welcome everyone.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:04,710
My name is Teta.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:12,330
Today we are discussing about SNT Cloud
native integration and SRE approach

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,420
to enterprise digital transformation.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,900
Digital transformation demands a new
approach to integration as our nations

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,030
increase a adopt cloud technologies, the
reliability and operational excellence.

7
00:00:27,315 --> 00:00:31,905
Of integration platforms have become
paramount to business success.

8
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:38,295
This presentation explores how SRE
or Site Reliability Engineering

9
00:00:38,685 --> 00:00:43,545
principles can revolutionize
cloud native integration, enabling

10
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:48,855
organizations to maintain exceptional
uptime while accelerating innovation.

11
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:54,135
Drawing from the real world implementation
across multiple industries, we will

12
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,550
provide actionable strategies for.

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,070
IT professionals looking to build
more T integration architecture.

14
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,880
The Now let's dive into the
evolution of integration challenges.

15
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,540
So integration architecture have evolved
dramatically over the past decades.

16
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,310
Traditional integration patterns,
face significant challenges

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,080
in distributed environments.

18
00:01:22,575 --> 00:01:27,975
Where complexity increases exponentially
with each service and data source.

19
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:33,795
The move to cloud native architecture has
amplified these challenges, introducing

20
00:01:33,914 --> 00:01:39,975
concerns around dynamic monitoring,
scaling, and cross cloud dependencies

21
00:01:40,365 --> 00:01:44,835
that traditional monitoring approaches
struggle to address effectively.

22
00:01:45,435 --> 00:01:48,700
Let's take a brief journey through
the evolution of integration.

23
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,000
We started in the monolithic era with
centralized point to point connections.

24
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:01,230
Then say, then came the service oriented
architecture that introduced enterprise

25
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,420
service buses and improved reusability.

26
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,100
Today we are in the age of cloud
native integration where distributor

27
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,520
microservices and containerized
deployments rule the day.

28
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,870
And now we are moving towards
an SRE driven approach.

29
00:02:16,364 --> 00:02:22,454
That focuses on reliability Through
advanced observability and automated

30
00:02:22,545 --> 00:02:28,215
operations, each stage has brought new
challenges and our current environment

31
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:31,155
demand even more robust solutions.

32
00:02:32,565 --> 00:02:38,024
So now let's dive into the core SRE
principles for integration excellence.

33
00:02:38,535 --> 00:02:42,765
Now let's look at the principles
that drive integration excellence.

34
00:02:42,855 --> 00:02:44,984
First, strategic reliability.

35
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,000
Aligning business objectives with error
budgets and service level expectations.

36
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,700
Next, comprehensive observability.

37
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,740
So end-to-end tracing and
metrics to monitor every

38
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,910
part of the integration flow.

39
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,310
Third, automation.

40
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,780
First, implementing self-healing
systems and auto remediation

41
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,880
to reduce manual intervention.

42
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,140
And finally, the continuous improvement,
learning from the incidents and

43
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,940
chaos engineering experiments.

44
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,310
To constantly refine our systems.

45
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,200
These principles allow us to
balance innovation with the

46
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,210
stability that business demand.

47
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,079
Now let's look at the defining
effective service level objectives.

48
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:37,050
So service level objectives or SLOs,
or the foundation of the reliable

49
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,970
integration for availability.

50
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,720
SLOs define uptime expectations
for integration endpoints.

51
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:49,930
Message brokers and API gateways based
on the business impact measuring both

52
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,010
synchronous request success rates
and asynchronous message delivery

53
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,130
guarantees with latency SLOs.

54
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,200
Established performance thresholds
for data processing pipelines with

55
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,230
both average and percentile targets.

56
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:10,375
A code for variable
workloads with context aware.

57
00:04:11,005 --> 00:04:14,605
Thresholds based on payload
size and complexity.

58
00:04:15,295 --> 00:04:20,695
And for throughput SLOs define capacity
objectives for message processing rates,

59
00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:23,485
concurrent connections and transaction.

60
00:04:23,515 --> 00:04:28,045
Total transactional volume
include elasticity metrics that

61
00:04:28,045 --> 00:04:31,870
measure how quickly the system
scales to meet demand spikes.

62
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,465
Now let's look at building
observability into integration flows.

63
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,930
Observability is critical to
understanding what's happening in

64
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,880
our complex integration environment.

65
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:52,469
We start by instrumenting our code,
embedding tracing metrics and logging

66
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,510
at every integration boundary.

67
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,219
Then we collect and aggregate
this data into centralized systems

68
00:04:59,219 --> 00:05:03,975
for analysis, visualizing these
patterns through dashboards.

69
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:10,739
Give us a clear picture
of end-to-end flow.

70
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:18,239
Health and intelligent alerting based on
SLOs helps us react swiftly to anomalies.

71
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:24,179
This comprehensive approach reduces
our mean time to diagnose issues and

72
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:26,640
keep our services running smoothly.

73
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,659
Kios Engineering for
integration resilience.

74
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:33,869
Now let's talk about the kios engineering.

75
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:36,930
Proactive approach to resilience.

76
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:43,599
By deliberately injecting control
failures such as API rate limiting

77
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,700
or message broker outages.

78
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,570
We can observe how our
systems react under stress.

79
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:55,180
We start with a clear hypothesis,
inject failures, measure the

80
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,250
system's response against our
SLOs, and then refine our design.

81
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:05,914
This it alternative process helps us
building self-healing integration flows

82
00:06:06,484 --> 00:06:12,094
that can gracefully handle disruptions
and continue operations under pressure.

83
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:18,994
Now let's dive into a case study
where we have for a financial

84
00:06:19,234 --> 00:06:21,004
services integration platform.

85
00:06:21,544 --> 00:06:26,164
So here is a, there is a real
world example from the financial

86
00:06:26,164 --> 00:06:29,014
services sector, a global firm.

87
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:34,759
Transformed its legacy integration
architecture to a cloud native platform,

88
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:41,779
supporting over 3000 APIs and processing
more than 500 million daily transactions.

89
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:46,339
They achieved 99.99% availability.

90
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:54,979
Reduced incident response times by 70%,
increased throughput fivefold, and reached

91
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:58,519
85% automation in incident remediation.

92
00:06:59,074 --> 00:07:04,594
Their success story underscores how
comprehensive observability and automated

93
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:09,694
canary analysis can prevent outages
and drive continuous improvement.

94
00:07:11,104 --> 00:07:15,484
Now let's dive into securing our
distributor integration architecture.

95
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:21,274
As our integration platforms
span multiple services and clouds

96
00:07:21,604 --> 00:07:24,544
security became a paramount concern.

97
00:07:25,324 --> 00:07:30,904
We adopt a zero trust architecture to
ensure service to service authentication

98
00:07:30,904 --> 00:07:32,404
regardless of the network location.

99
00:07:33,274 --> 00:07:40,444
By centralizing secrets management
and automation, automating

100
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:43,764
credential rotations, we reduce risk.

101
00:07:44,634 --> 00:07:49,344
Data lineage help, helping tracking,
maintaining visibility of the

102
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:54,324
sensitive data as it flows through
integration pipelines with automated

103
00:07:54,324 --> 00:07:57,324
compliance checks, runtime protection.

104
00:07:57,484 --> 00:08:03,814
Deploy API gateways with threat detection
capabilities to identify usual patterns,

105
00:08:03,964 --> 00:08:07,069
unusual patterns in integration traffic.

106
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:12,354
It's a. Security is not an add-on.

107
00:08:12,684 --> 00:08:15,654
It's a integral part of
the resident integration.

108
00:08:17,244 --> 00:08:22,614
So now coming to automating
integration operations automation is

109
00:08:22,614 --> 00:08:25,884
a cornerstone of the SRE philosophy.

110
00:08:26,634 --> 00:08:31,884
We start with configuration
management, storing every detail as

111
00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:34,524
code, and managing changes via tops.

112
00:08:35,454 --> 00:08:39,774
With deployment automation,
we implement a blue or green.

113
00:08:39,864 --> 00:08:47,574
And canary strategies that automatically
roll back if SLOs are breached.

114
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:55,674
Effective incident response is achieved
through predefined runbooks and automated

115
00:08:55,674 --> 00:09:01,074
diagnosis, while capacity management
users predict two, scaling based on

116
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,264
historical data and business patterns.

117
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:08,739
Automating these operations,
minimize the human error and allow

118
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:10,899
our teams to focus on innovation.

119
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:16,089
So coming to building a
shared reliability culture.

120
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,869
So technical measures
alone are not enough.

121
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:22,869
Building a culture of shared
reliability is essential.

122
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:27,699
This means creating shared
accountability between development

123
00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:33,189
operations and business teams through
joint metrics and regular reviews.

124
00:09:34,044 --> 00:09:38,124
Encouraging knowledge sharing
helps everyone understand the

125
00:09:38,124 --> 00:09:40,314
dependencies in our integration flows.

126
00:09:41,034 --> 00:09:44,454
Celebrating reliability
milestones and adopting a

127
00:09:44,454 --> 00:09:46,734
blameless learning from Postmas.

128
00:09:47,184 --> 00:09:51,444
Fostering an environment where
continuous improvement is the norm.

129
00:09:52,554 --> 00:09:56,394
This cultural shift ensures
that reliability is a

130
00:09:56,484 --> 00:09:58,674
collective ongoing priority.

131
00:10:00,144 --> 00:10:05,124
Now let's dive into implementing the
roadmap and next steps to wrap up

132
00:10:05,124 --> 00:10:11,224
our strategy here is a actionable
roadmap beginning with a thorough

133
00:10:11,224 --> 00:10:15,364
assessment of your current integration
flows and reliability metrics.

134
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:21,844
So define SLOs, so establishing
business aligned, reliable reliability

135
00:10:21,844 --> 00:10:27,454
targets for key integration
services, implementing observability.

136
00:10:28,084 --> 00:10:32,554
So instrument integration components
with consistent telemetry.

137
00:10:33,124 --> 00:10:39,424
And last one, automate operations
build CICD pipelines with reliability

138
00:10:39,424 --> 00:10:41,314
gates and auto remediation.

139
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:47,709
This roadmap is designed to guide
you on your journey towards a

140
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:52,054
resonant cloud native integration
architecture driven by SRE principles.

141
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:53,929
Last.

142
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,679
Lastly, thank you for
attending this session.

143
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:02,269
I hope today's presentation provided
you with a valuable insight and

144
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:06,109
actionable strategies for transforming
your integration platforms with SRE.

145
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:06,739
Thank you.
