00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,269
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,240
Thank you for taking the time
to join me for my talk on

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,220
transforming financial workflow.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,649
Harnessing automation in
multi cloud ecosystem.

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,629
My name is Navin Kavya.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,330
I've been working at Couchbase as
director of data engineering and

7
00:00:18,339 --> 00:00:22,670
have been working in the field of
automations and cloud technologies

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,019
for many years, helping organization
transform their financial processes.

9
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:31,669
All right, let me get started
with a quick question.

10
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:37,775
How many of you have faced tax
errors and missed deadlines or

11
00:00:37,785 --> 00:00:39,754
after due manner reconciliations.

12
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,730
But you're not alone here.

13
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,680
But these challenges are too common.

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,540
But today, we will explore how
automations and multi cloud ecosystem

15
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,020
can help your financial workflows.

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,159
In this session, we are going to
talk about how we can leverage

17
00:00:56,169 --> 00:01:00,309
cloud technologies, automations,
and integration to streamline

18
00:01:00,349 --> 00:01:03,450
everything from reconciliations.

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,770
And we will also discuss how we can
integrate systems like Salesforce,

20
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,960
NetSuite and Avalaro to reduce tax errors
and also cut manual work, also making

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,970
your financial team much more efficient.

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,930
By the end, you will also see how
APL and microservices can become the

23
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,420
backbone of your financial operations.

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,010
All right, so let's learn about
the problems and legacy financial

25
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,690
systems in the next slide.

26
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:39,490
So let's begin by discussing the
current state of many financial systems.

27
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:44,420
So today, a lot of organizations
still rely on legacy infrastructure.

28
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:51,570
So this types of designs were built
years ago and you can also imagine

29
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,700
they were in build for this type of
automations and seamless integrations.

30
00:01:56,155 --> 00:01:57,045
that we need today.

31
00:01:57,545 --> 00:02:01,435
So let's take tax
reconciliations for an example.

32
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:06,885
A lot of companies still handle
tax data manually, entering it from

33
00:02:06,885 --> 00:02:11,704
different sources, bringing it from ERP
systems, or it could be from software,

34
00:02:11,735 --> 00:02:14,885
accounting software, or tax services.

35
00:02:15,334 --> 00:02:20,915
So this process is 100 percent error
prone, and it's also time consuming.

36
00:02:21,415 --> 00:02:25,665
And always, finance team
spends hours or even days.

37
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,450
verifying to make sure that
everything is compliant and correct.

38
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:35,820
this efficiency adds up quickly
when your systems aren't integrated.

39
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,780
And it creates bottleneck and also
increases the risk of mistakes.

40
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:46,820
So the good news is where, this is where
the automation can make a huge difference.

41
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:53,340
Let's take a look at the automations,
how it could solve real-time problems.

42
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,170
So now we have also
established the problems.

43
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,970
Let's talk about this solutioning part.

44
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,150
So automation can actually reduce.

45
00:03:02,535 --> 00:03:08,645
A lot of manual work for your team has
to do by integrating your financial

46
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:11,995
systems and automating workflows.

47
00:03:12,045 --> 00:03:15,385
You can actually eliminate
errors and improve efficiencies.

48
00:03:16,024 --> 00:03:22,215
For example, let's say you need to
make tax data across different systems

49
00:03:22,634 --> 00:03:24,645
with the right tool and automation.

50
00:03:24,645 --> 00:03:28,245
In addition, the tax data can
be synced automatically across

51
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:33,065
platforms like Salesforce,
Avalara, NetSuite in real time.

52
00:03:33,565 --> 00:03:37,295
So this actually ensures that
your data is always up to date,

53
00:03:37,405 --> 00:03:39,355
accurate, and ready to use.

54
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:43,825
Also drastically reducing
the chance for tax errors.

55
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:50,345
So why automation isn't just an
automation, but it also improves accuracy.

56
00:03:51,055 --> 00:03:53,705
So it cuts down on time consuming tasks.

57
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:59,040
Imagine eliminating the need
to manually check things and

58
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,610
reconcile data across systems.

59
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,270
With the right tool in place, your
finance team can actually focus on higher

60
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,460
level strategic activities instead.

61
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:15,980
So let's see some benefits of multi
cloud ecosystem and how API led

62
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,449
microservices could help, right?

63
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:23,450
So to really unlock the potentials
of automations, you actually

64
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,880
need the right architecture.

65
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:30,320
This is where multi cloud ecosystems
and API led microservices.

66
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:31,659
Come into play.

67
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,340
multi cloud ecosystems means you're
actually leveraging the strength of

68
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:46,089
different clouds providers, for example
Amazon, Azure or GCP depending on what

69
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:52,099
fits best for your needs whether it
is scalability security or performance

70
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,994
the multi cloud environments allow
you to customize the infrastructure

71
00:04:57,034 --> 00:04:59,215
that best supports your operations.

72
00:04:59,715 --> 00:05:04,174
So now, how do we connect all
these tools and platforms, right?

73
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:08,525
So the answer is using
the API led microservices.

74
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:15,229
so technically the microservices allows
you to break down your processes into

75
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:22,329
a smaller independent services, each
doing one specific task and utilizing

76
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:28,660
API are the glue that binds all the
services together, enabling seamless

77
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,051
data flow between platforms like
Salesforce, Avalara, Salesforce, Avalara,

78
00:05:33,051 --> 00:05:33,454
Salesforce, Avalara, Salesforce, Avalara.

79
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:38,914
So this architecture isn't just
flexible, it's scalable and

80
00:05:38,914 --> 00:05:40,584
designed to grow with your business.

81
00:05:41,554 --> 00:05:46,914
So it also allows you the smoother
integrations and easier upgrades and

82
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:48,944
more reliable performance overall.

83
00:05:49,444 --> 00:05:53,344
So let's talk about when
a sync fails, right?

84
00:05:53,624 --> 00:05:59,014
So there are situations where a
sync fails between systems due

85
00:05:59,014 --> 00:06:01,434
to various varieties of reasons.

86
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:04,464
It could be due to some data incorrect.

87
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:11,794
So how do we reconcile all of this to
ensure that systems stays consistent

88
00:06:11,884 --> 00:06:14,134
across all the platforms, right?

89
00:06:14,814 --> 00:06:16,944
So this is where actually
the data warehouse.

90
00:06:17,429 --> 00:06:19,399
becomes a critical lifeline.

91
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:25,169
Imagine resolving over thousands of
invoices mismatched in just two hours

92
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:28,519
compared to usually takes 10 to 15 days.

93
00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:34,309
So this kind of theoretical possibility
it's become reality achieved

94
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:36,239
by leveraging an ETL pipeline.

95
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:39,179
So what does this ETL pipeline does?

96
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:40,544
Technically.

97
00:06:40,584 --> 00:06:44,754
So basically the ETL type
pipeline extracts the raw

98
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:46,904
data from various systems.

99
00:06:46,924 --> 00:06:51,404
In this case, it extracts data
from Salesforce and NetSuites and

100
00:06:51,404 --> 00:06:55,884
loads them into a central data lake
and it transforms it for analysis.

101
00:06:55,994 --> 00:07:01,734
And we can use SQL and Python scripts
to compare data between systems,

102
00:07:02,034 --> 00:07:04,224
flagging discrepancies for reviews.

103
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:09,639
And this scripts not only miss
identifies the mismatch, but also

104
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:15,489
load them into an automation tool like
iPaaS, ensuring that discrepancies

105
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,839
are resolved quickly and efficiency.

106
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:23,339
So this reduces a lot of
manual toil checking systems

107
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:25,539
to ensure the data are in sync.

108
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:30,979
By doing so, this consistency
is across all the platforms

109
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:32,599
and ensures data integrity.

110
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:34,379
So this approach.

111
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,509
This is not just saving time, but also
making, enhancing the accuracy and

112
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,539
reliability of your financial data.

113
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,209
Let's talk about how 98 percent
of tax accuracy can be achieved

114
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,479
utilizing APIs and iPaaS.

115
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:56,449
today, so one of the key challenges
companies face in tax management

116
00:07:56,529 --> 00:07:59,069
is the risk of human errors, right?

117
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:04,149
When they're trying to reconcile,
text data across various platforms.

118
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:08,339
For example, like Salesforce,
Avalara or NetSuite.

119
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:13,409
So let's take a imagine a situation
where you are actually dealing with

120
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,189
a large volume of transactions.

121
00:08:15,774 --> 00:08:18,264
across multiple systems, right?

122
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:24,144
For tax rates, product categories, and
tax exemptions might be actually stored

123
00:08:24,164 --> 00:08:29,924
in a different systems and manually
updating each one can actually lead

124
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:32,564
to discrepancies and costly errors.

125
00:08:33,274 --> 00:08:37,684
So these errors not only impact
the accuracy of your tax reporting,

126
00:08:37,904 --> 00:08:42,934
but also can lead to penalties or
technically audit down the lane.

127
00:08:43,834 --> 00:08:48,969
So this is where Utilizing the
API and integration platform as

128
00:08:48,969 --> 00:08:50,629
a service come into the play.

129
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:56,219
By utilizing the iPaaS solution,
the companies can ensure that tax

130
00:08:56,219 --> 00:09:02,499
data is automatically synced in real
time across all relevant platforms.

131
00:09:03,204 --> 00:09:08,284
So this API actually facilitates a
seamless communications between systems,

132
00:09:08,354 --> 00:09:13,744
ensuring that updates made in one systems
syncs over to another system such as

133
00:09:13,744 --> 00:09:21,554
from NetSuite or Salesforce and reflected
instantly in Avalara for tax calculations.

134
00:09:22,054 --> 00:09:26,174
So this results in 98 percent
improvement in tax accuracy

135
00:09:26,564 --> 00:09:28,634
as automated reconciliation.

136
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:33,929
Reduces the risk of manual errors with
the integrations of this platform.

137
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:39,419
The tax rates and financial data
are always up to date and compliance

138
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:43,189
is maintained without the need
for the constant manual check.

139
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:49,519
What makes this possible is the
power of API led integrations.

140
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:55,329
So instead of trying to manualising
data between systems, API actually

141
00:09:55,379 --> 00:10:00,529
enables systems to talk to each other,
ensuring that all your tax related data

142
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:03,669
is consistent, accurate, and up to date.

143
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:09,059
For example, let's take invoices
that is processed in Salesforce.

144
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:14,059
It's triggered an API to NetSuite
to update the financials.

145
00:10:14,619 --> 00:10:17,869
And another call to Avalara
to calculate the right tax.

146
00:10:18,214 --> 00:10:23,494
This way, the tax errors are minimized
and your team is no longer to waste time

147
00:10:23,994 --> 00:10:26,114
manually checking for discrepancies.

148
00:10:26,614 --> 00:10:31,534
So in this slide, why multi cloud
and iPaaS is unstoppable, right?

149
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:36,604
So when you're combining multi cloud
with iPaaS, it delivers the best of

150
00:10:36,614 --> 00:10:42,785
breed setup, enabling you to leverage
specialized cloud provider for optimal

151
00:10:42,785 --> 00:10:45,029
performance and cost efficiencies.

152
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:49,699
So rather than relying on a single
provider, you can actually select

153
00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:51,729
the best tool for each function.

154
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:57,269
So whether it could be cloud storage
or a data processing or a security,

155
00:10:57,849 --> 00:11:02,819
ensuring that every part of your
business operates at a peak performance.

156
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:09,549
Additionally, API led redundancy
is a key benefit of this approach.

157
00:11:10,124 --> 00:11:14,484
By spreading workloads across
multiple clouds, you can actually

158
00:11:14,484 --> 00:11:18,764
ensure business continuity even
in the events of an outage.

159
00:11:19,324 --> 00:11:23,844
So failover workflows seamlessly
switch to an alternative cloud

160
00:11:23,844 --> 00:11:29,604
provider if one experienced issues,
reducing downtime and preventing

161
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:31,844
disruption to your final operations.

162
00:11:32,344 --> 00:11:36,944
So with multi cloud and iPaaS, your
workflows remains uninterrupted

163
00:11:37,444 --> 00:11:42,084
and you can quickly adapt to
changing business need, making your

164
00:11:42,084 --> 00:11:45,004
financial system truly unstoppable.

165
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:50,614
And this is your enterprise
architecture blueprint, where the

166
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:55,994
APIs and the microservices bridge
between systems and multi cloud

167
00:11:56,204 --> 00:11:58,424
eliminates the single point of failure.

168
00:11:58,989 --> 00:12:04,059
And it is just not an integration, it
is actually turning chaos into clarity

169
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:06,649
with the future proof foundations.

170
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:13,799
In this diagram, on the left side, it's
the product led growth, where the end user

171
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:20,449
log into the e commerce and they, Purchase
an order that syncs over to iPaaS.

172
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:23,129
iPaaS routes it to Salesforce.

173
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:28,609
An invoice is generated and with
the tax calculation from Havalero

174
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:31,609
and gets pushed out to iPaaS.

175
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:34,729
iPaaS takes the request and
sends it over to NetSuite.

176
00:12:35,229 --> 00:12:39,629
and on the top most, you see there
are ETL tool that is constantly

177
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:42,449
extracting data from different systems.

178
00:12:42,584 --> 00:12:47,284
and loading into jRiveros for analysis
purpose and also for reconciliations.

179
00:12:47,784 --> 00:12:54,454
So in this slide, let's talk about some
tangible key metrics and how impact

180
00:12:54,814 --> 00:13:00,074
of integrating automations and cloud
technologies into financial workflows.

181
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:05,114
Firstly, we achieved 50 percent
of reduction in manual effort.

182
00:13:05,714 --> 00:13:08,784
This frees up your time
for more strategic work.

183
00:13:09,284 --> 00:13:13,524
And the next, we actually
achieved 98 percent tax accuracy.

184
00:13:13,849 --> 00:13:18,579
This reduces the risk of complaints
issue and the next 30 percent

185
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:23,279
faster revenue recognition
improves cash flow and agility.

186
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:27,819
And lastly, there's cost
saving from reducing errors

187
00:13:27,859 --> 00:13:30,109
and resolving disputes faster.

188
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,429
Which of this matrix would you have
most impact on your organizations?

189
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:38,949
And here is your 90 days
path for automations.

190
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:45,259
And this roadmap allows you to
automate your financial workflows

191
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:51,169
from phase one, 30 days, you audit
and deliver an integrations blueprint.

192
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:58,099
In phase 2, 60 days, you actually
test the real time tax sync

193
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,789
and achieve data accuracy.

194
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:05,249
In the phase 3, all 90 days,
you ensure resilience using

195
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:07,569
multi cloud and ensures 99.

196
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,299
99 percent uptime.

197
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:14,329
So let me ask you this, how many of
you are planning to start an automation

198
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,549
project in the next three to six months?

199
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:23,939
So to wrap up, I hope you now see how
automations and multi cloud ecosystems

200
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:29,899
can revolutionize financial workflow
from reducing tax error to cutting

201
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:32,339
down on manual reconciliation work.

202
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,919
Automation can unlock
significant efficiencies.

203
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:41,299
So by leveraging API led microservices,
you can actually create an agile

204
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:44,059
scalable financial infrastructure.

205
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:47,514
That not only improves day
to day operation but also

206
00:14:47,514 --> 00:14:49,644
supports long term growth.

207
00:14:50,134 --> 00:14:56,754
