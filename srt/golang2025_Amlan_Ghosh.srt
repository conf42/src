00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,590
robust solutions in cloud technologies.

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,799
So welcome.

6
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:19,619
Welcome to a journey through
transformative landscape where cloud

7
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,650
computing meets artificial intelligence.

8
00:00:23,445 --> 00:00:28,544
Today we'll dive into practical
strategies and insights that have shaped

9
00:00:29,415 --> 00:00:34,694
my path, career path from a software
engineer to a principal cloud architect.

10
00:00:35,194 --> 00:00:40,595
Along the way, we will also explore how
the integration of this technologies

11
00:00:40,595 --> 00:00:46,324
has revolutionized industries, opened
up new opportunities, and changed

12
00:00:46,324 --> 00:00:48,905
the way we approach problem solving.

13
00:00:49,405 --> 00:00:54,535
This session is not just technical
knowledge, but also about exploring the

14
00:00:54,535 --> 00:01:02,995
mindset, the tool set challenges and
innovations that accompany this journey.

15
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:09,104
Whether you are a seasoned professional
or starting fresh to explore this space,

16
00:01:09,164 --> 00:01:14,834
I hope you will find valuable takeaways
that you can apply to your own career.

17
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:16,949
And projects.

18
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:18,749
So let's get started.

19
00:01:19,249 --> 00:01:19,789
So

20
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:24,729
before getting started, let
me bring out some data points.

21
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:32,499
According to a recent Gartner study, the
global cloud market is expected to reach

22
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:37,839
around $800 billion by the end of 2025.

23
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,600
A McKenzie report outlines that
enterprises are projected to

24
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,650
spend over $1 trillion on cloud
services and infrastructure by 2025.

25
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:56,600
Another study shows that 75%
of enterprises are expected to

26
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,900
integrate artificial intelligence
into their cloud services by 2025.

27
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:09,330
Cloud computing has fundamentally
reshaped how enterprises architect

28
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,430
deploy and scale their applications.

29
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:12,830
Cloud architecture.

30
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,520
Understanding the cloud architecture
design involves understanding different

31
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,110
cloud services like compute service,
storage, service, network services,

32
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,570
streaming services, data lake,
serverless architecture, event driven

33
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,040
architecture, so on and so forth.

34
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:36,030
Architecture design in cloud also involves
cloud-based data, delivery models, such

35
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,190
as, software as a service, infrastructure
as a service, infrastructure as a code.

36
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:49,430
So this is where the cloud is
helping build new applications.

37
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,950
On the contrary.

38
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:52,499
AI integration.

39
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:57,689
AI capabilities have evolved from
experimental add-ons to essential

40
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:03,119
components of modern cloud architecture,
driving automation, insights,

41
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:05,129
and innovation across industries.

42
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:10,010
AI enhances cloud computing by
providing advanced data analytics,

43
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:15,279
automation and machine learning ca
capabilities, improved data management.

44
00:03:16,144 --> 00:03:18,634
automation as we spoke.

45
00:03:19,054 --> 00:03:20,674
And another thing is scalability.

46
00:03:21,174 --> 00:03:27,884
AI helps in scaling cloud resources
efficiently based on demand, AI

47
00:03:27,884 --> 00:03:31,934
powered predictive scaling, leverages
machine learning algorithms to

48
00:03:31,934 --> 00:03:37,609
forecast future workload demands based
on historical and real time data.

49
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:44,439
For instance, an AI system can analyze
patterns in user activity and predict

50
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:46,809
when there will be spike in the demand.

51
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:52,589
AI driven predictive scaling can
reduce cloud infrastructure cost by

52
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:58,039
30%, so combining cloud architecture
with artificial intelligence

53
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:03,144
opens up numerous opportunities
for innovation and career growth.

54
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:08,204
So embers continuous learning, stay
updated with industry strengths

55
00:04:08,654 --> 00:04:13,004
and develop a robust skillset
to thrive in this dynamic field.

56
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:18,515
So moving forward, just
a little bit about me

57
00:04:19,015 --> 00:04:20,244
and my personal journey.

58
00:04:20,784 --> 00:04:22,044
I'm a builder by passion.

59
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,819
and initial years of my career,
I have built robust, developed

60
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:28,439
robust enterprise applications.

61
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:34,649
Then I mastered AWS ecosystem,
building scalable applications

62
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,969
using cloud services.

63
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:42,049
Moving forward as a solution
architect at A-A-W-S-I translated

64
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:45,829
complex business requirements
into resilient technical solution.

65
00:04:46,294 --> 00:04:51,244
While optimizing all the pillars of well
architected framework like security,

66
00:04:51,754 --> 00:04:57,274
operation excellence, reliability,
performance efficiency, and cost

67
00:04:57,274 --> 00:05:02,244
optimization, and now I spearhead
Enterprise wide Digital transformation

68
00:05:02,244 --> 00:05:07,429
initiative with measurable business
impact that seamlessly integrate with.

69
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,189
Artificial intelligence and
machine learning capabilities.

70
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:13,399
So that's a little bit about me.

71
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:17,619
So we discussed my journey to
a principal cloud architect.

72
00:05:17,619 --> 00:05:20,619
Now let's see, what are the
essential technical competencies

73
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:23,169
that help me build my foundation?

74
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:30,469
Just as a sky capper, skater needs a deep,
solid foundation to support its height.

75
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:34,119
And withstand external FO forces.

76
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,499
A strong technical foundation
is essential for building robust

77
00:05:38,499 --> 00:05:40,299
and scalable technology solution.

78
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,449
So let's start from the base.

79
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:49,919
Number five, the core, and there is no
substitute for hands-on coding experience.

80
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:56,509
So I started building, hands-on
applications, using AWS services.

81
00:05:57,074 --> 00:06:04,794
made myself proficient with, the compute
engine, EC2 or the storage service, S3.

82
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:11,524
then the serverless, offerings from
AWS like Lambda, stay functions, and

83
00:06:11,574 --> 00:06:14,154
database services like RDS and many more.

84
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:20,024
So after doing my hands-on with this
kind of center building applications,

85
00:06:20,024 --> 00:06:25,324
real-time applications on, these
services, I then explored, infrastructure

86
00:06:25,324 --> 00:06:31,124
as a code mastering cloud form, cloud
formation and terraform automation to

87
00:06:31,334 --> 00:06:33,904
stand up my infrastructure, using code.

88
00:06:34,404 --> 00:06:37,524
The next one is performance optimization.

89
00:06:37,524 --> 00:06:43,374
Then I focused on architecting scalable
solutions and cost efficient solutions

90
00:06:43,374 --> 00:06:45,714
who are performant and resilient.

91
00:06:46,214 --> 00:06:52,984
The next step was getting into the
security and the compliance angle of it.

92
00:06:53,734 --> 00:06:57,334
Im implementing zero test
architecture and governance.

93
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:04,614
And then I mastered the artificial
intelligence integration by deploying ML

94
00:07:04,614 --> 00:07:07,854
services and implementing custom models.

95
00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:14,144
Now, when we spoke about my initial
journey, let's, discover some case

96
00:07:14,144 --> 00:07:18,239
studies, and how I was able to deliver.

97
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:22,629
Results to a measurable
business goal, right?

98
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:27,919
So let's, delve into a real world
example of how these technologies

99
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,389
are Revolution Industries, right?

100
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:37,609
One of the most impactful areas is
healthcare, where cloud and AI are

101
00:07:37,609 --> 00:07:43,449
transforming patient care, data
management, and operational efficiency.

102
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:45,749
So just, what is the challenge, right?

103
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:50,929
So in this, case study, we'll examine how
healthcare organizations were leveraging

104
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:57,589
cloud computing and AI to enhance
the service delivery, improve patient

105
00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:00,319
outcomes and streamline operations.

106
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,519
In the past few years, our
regional healthcare has

107
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,589
experienced exponential growth.

108
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:13,759
Patient numbers have surged by 200% our
legacy, electronic, Healthcare, sorry.

109
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:19,969
Electronic health record system was not
designed to handle this scale leading

110
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:25,939
to a severe performance, bottlenecks
that affected patient care, efficiency,

111
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:32,219
and operational productivity To further
complicate the matters, as we explored

112
00:08:32,249 --> 00:08:38,189
migration to modern system, we were
confronted with integrate requirements of.

113
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,069
HIPAA and GDPR compliance.

114
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,889
So these regulations demand that
patient remains patient data remains

115
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:54,399
secure, private, and accessible
across international borders while

116
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,129
maintaining strict auditability.

117
00:08:57,629 --> 00:09:02,159
So ensuring compliance added a
significant complexity to the

118
00:09:02,219 --> 00:09:04,889
migration process to address.

119
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,549
The growing complexity and the demand
of healthcare it, we architected

120
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:15,709
a secured hybrid cloud environment
that meets stringent regulatory

121
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:17,269
and operational requirements.

122
00:09:17,869 --> 00:09:23,619
The design incorporated, end-to-end,
encryption to safeguard sensitive patient

123
00:09:23,619 --> 00:09:30,809
data alongside granular access control
that ensures only authorized personal.

124
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:37,189
Have access to specific data upholding
both security and compliance standards.

125
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:41,439
In addition, we integrated machine
learning modules into the system

126
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:44,974
to advance clinical capabilities.

127
00:09:45,474 --> 00:09:51,354
This module serve, as a powerful
tools of clinical decision support,

128
00:09:51,954 --> 00:09:54,144
empowering, empowering healthcare.

129
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:58,389
Providers with real time
insights to enhance patient care.

130
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:03,089
Furthermore, we developed predictive
analytics capabilities enabling

131
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:08,399
proactive identification of potential
health risk and optimizing resource

132
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,829
allocation within the network.

133
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:15,849
This solution demonstrates how
innovative technology can breach the

134
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:19,149
gap between security and intelligence.

135
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:24,069
Paving the way for more efficient
and impactful healthcare system.

136
00:10:24,569 --> 00:10:25,989
A similar state, case study.

137
00:10:26,774 --> 00:10:34,284
Was, also, of my experience that I have
faced for a retail omnichannel platform.

138
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:41,354
So the challenges was the inventory
management was siloed with fragmented

139
00:10:41,354 --> 00:10:43,694
online and in-store experience.

140
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:49,634
Customer faced inconsistent pricing and
product availability across channels.

141
00:10:50,134 --> 00:10:52,814
So we'll discuss more
about the cloud migration.

142
00:10:52,844 --> 00:10:57,264
I have another, p PT two that
describes a little bit more detail.

143
00:10:58,134 --> 00:11:04,254
however, we implemented a unified AWS data
platform with microservices architecture

144
00:11:04,704 --> 00:11:10,554
leveraged, even driven design for seamless
real-time inventory synchronization.

145
00:11:11,055 --> 00:11:16,535
On top of this, we enhanced, we
deployed ML algorithms for dynamic

146
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:21,965
inventory forecasting and replenishment
created personalized customer

147
00:11:21,965 --> 00:11:26,315
experience through behavioral analysis
and shopping pattern recognition.

148
00:11:26,315 --> 00:11:32,260
I. And finally the overall business
impact was we achieved 28% higher

149
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:39,410
conversion rate through improved customers
experience, reduced stock outs by 45%

150
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:45,620
with intelligent inventory management,
generated three x return on investment

151
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,970
within 18 months of implementation,
cloud implementation, along with.

152
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:56,330
Artificial intelligence and when also
there were, we implemented from the

153
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:01,370
AI perspective, we have implemented AI
recommendation engines, personalizations.

154
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,940
So yeah, all together this
was the business benefit.

155
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,360
So overall, the business outcomes of
this successful implementations are,

156
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:14,900
42% reduction in infrastructure cost.

157
00:12:15,455 --> 00:12:18,425
It's a savings in infrastructure segment.

158
00:12:18,425 --> 00:12:22,325
There's a significant cost reduction
realized through strategic cloud

159
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:26,815
architecture optimization across
enterprise client profile, there

160
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:30,295
was 68% faster development.

161
00:12:30,745 --> 00:12:34,285
It's the time to market, right?

162
00:12:34,705 --> 00:12:40,415
So from the inception of an idea
to make that feature available.

163
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:45,095
It was a 68% reduction in time
because we are not spending time on.

164
00:12:45,345 --> 00:12:48,405
software or, software procurement, right?

165
00:12:48,455 --> 00:12:49,175
we are not doing that.

166
00:12:49,545 --> 00:12:53,745
we are basically utilizing, oh, sorry,
software, hardware procurement, rather

167
00:12:53,795 --> 00:12:56,015
my capacity, what capacity it'll run.

168
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:59,565
we, in, in cloud environment,
it's all like p as you go,

169
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,185
you have this service, okay?

170
00:13:01,185 --> 00:13:03,955
You, use this service
and you pay for that.

171
00:13:04,455 --> 00:13:05,475
So in that way.

172
00:13:06,045 --> 00:13:07,755
We can procure.

173
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:11,115
If we have an idea, we can just go
ahead and start implementing that.

174
00:13:11,565 --> 00:13:15,795
yes, and this is why it is the
faster deployment cycles as well.

175
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:23,755
And we have, like around three x
return on in investment by integrating

176
00:13:23,755 --> 00:13:30,055
cloud and AI technologies within
24 months of implementations Also.

177
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:36,160
Availability there is
99.99% of time availability.

178
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,530
Near perfect system reliability,
delivered resilient cloud architectures

179
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:45,520
features geographic redundancy
and intelligence failover system.

180
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:50,985
So analyzing this case study, has
highlighted critical pain points.

181
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:57,155
such as scalability issues, system
inefficiencies, compliance challenges.

182
00:13:57,755 --> 00:14:01,955
These are precisely the types
of hurdle that cloud migration

183
00:14:02,165 --> 00:14:03,875
is designed to overcome.

184
00:14:04,685 --> 00:14:09,985
So let's talk and little bit dive deep
into, the cloud migration methodology.

185
00:14:10,285 --> 00:14:15,685
So cloud migration offers transformative
solutions enabling organizations to

186
00:14:15,685 --> 00:14:20,905
scale resources dynamically optimize
workload, and enhance data security.

187
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:27,205
In this context, transitioning to the
cloud becomes not just a technological

188
00:14:27,295 --> 00:14:32,905
upgrade, but a strategic imperative for
a long term go growth and resiliency.

189
00:14:33,155 --> 00:14:39,065
with that in mind, let's dive deep into
the cloud migration strategies, right?

190
00:14:39,565 --> 00:14:46,005
So the assessment phase lays the
groundwork for an efficient and

191
00:14:46,005 --> 00:14:50,895
seamless migration by minimizing
the risk of ensuring a clearer

192
00:14:50,895 --> 00:14:52,605
understanding of how to proceed.

193
00:14:53,105 --> 00:14:54,755
Evaluate existing system.

194
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:01,940
It helps identify what is working
well and what needs improvement, such

195
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:07,700
as outdated hardware, inefficient
processes, or capacity constraints, right?

196
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,330
In that assessment phase, we also do
cataloging of what all workloads is

197
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,670
essential, and we prioritize that.

198
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:20,710
Understand resource utilization,
ensure that high priority systems

199
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,360
receive the attention they deserve.

200
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,270
Then planning, then comes the
planning phase where we develop a

201
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:33,840
detailed timeline and mind stalls to
ensure the migration stays on track,

202
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:40,550
allocate time and task like testing
data, transfer system integration,

203
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:46,280
user training, selecting tools and
technologies, compliance strategy.

204
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,520
Okay, so this is involved
in the planning phase.

205
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:56,180
The planning phase is crucial to ensure a
smooth, organized, and secure migration.

206
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:01,040
It sets the stage for execution
while addressing potential

207
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,540
challenges ahead of time.

208
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,340
Then comes the migration,
the real migration phase.

209
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,860
So what are the activities we do there?

210
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,890
we initiate the migration,
with a pilot workload.

211
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,360
And validate that.

212
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:21,190
Then comes a data transfer application,
migration, security settings.

213
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,740
These are the key
activities in this phase.

214
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,050
Finally, validate the migration.

215
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:31,950
The post migration phase is
optimization phase, and it's all

216
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:36,390
about enhancing the cloud environment
to fully realize its potential

217
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,350
performance tuning cost management.

218
00:16:40,325 --> 00:16:45,995
Automating processes, advanced analytics,
continuous improvement and user feedback

219
00:16:46,025 --> 00:16:47,795
are key activities in this phase.

220
00:16:48,295 --> 00:16:51,675
Innovation in Drive is the
driving force that transform cloud

221
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:54,645
environments into strategic assets.

222
00:16:55,455 --> 00:16:59,885
After a successful migration and
optimization, organizations can

223
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:05,765
leverage the full potential of cloud
to foster creativity and growth.

224
00:17:06,265 --> 00:17:07,045
So

225
00:17:07,545 --> 00:17:09,905
we covered the innovation.

226
00:17:10,185 --> 00:17:10,905
yes.

227
00:17:11,475 --> 00:17:16,625
So now let's move on to ai, integrating
AI into your cloud solutions.

228
00:17:16,925 --> 00:17:17,920
talking about ai.

229
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,800
let's start with the data analysis.

230
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:27,350
So we build till now organizations
have many siloed system data residing,

231
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,550
on different platforms, right?

232
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:35,500
So we, the inception of cloud,
you can actually have a cloud

233
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,090
data lake built for you.

234
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,400
Okay, in the cloud data lake, and
on top of that data lake, you can

235
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,290
transform this raw data lakes into
actionable business intelligence through

236
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,940
advanced machine learning models.

237
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,470
Begin with foundational pattern
recognition, recognition

238
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,910
before, processing to predict
and prospective analysis.

239
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,190
Then comes automation on top of it.

240
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:05,670
Revolution Revolutionize operations
with AI driven automation, pipeline

241
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:10,200
delegate repetitive infrastructure
management to intelligent system.

242
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,180
Freeing your team to focus on the
strategic innovations and value creation.

243
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,540
Then comes the personalization.

244
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,390
craft, hype, hyper personalized user
experience with cloud-based AI engines.

245
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,310
deploy sophisticated
recommendation system.

246
00:18:25,655 --> 00:18:30,425
That continuously learn from the user
behavior and dramatically improving

247
00:18:30,785 --> 00:18:33,605
engagement metrics and conversion rates.

248
00:18:34,105 --> 00:18:40,515
Then strengthen your security posture
with AI powered threat intelligence.

249
00:18:40,815 --> 00:18:44,705
implement a neural network,
detection system that.

250
00:18:45,205 --> 00:18:50,275
Identifies sophisticated attack
patterns, zero day vulnerabilities,

251
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:55,225
far beyond the capabilities of
traditional rule-based approach.

252
00:18:55,475 --> 00:18:58,730
let's talk, now about the
carrier development strategies.

253
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:05,370
So what I found helpful for me is to
specialize in high demand areas, master

254
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:11,580
emerging technologies like serverless
architecture, Kubernetes containerization,

255
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,340
ai ml, cloud integration.
