1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,809
Joining my session at
conference JavaScript

2
00:00:03,309 --> 00:00:03,600
over.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,300
Modernized large scale healthcare
data engineering platforms from CMS

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,320
2000 claims submissions to air driven
violation pipelines that process

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,090
millions of transactions data.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,700
My goal today is to share how modern
JavaScript frameworks traditionally

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,540
used in web apps can be repurposed.

8
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,020
AI Ready Modular E violation systems.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,730
So these talk sites, the interaction
of healthcare data compliance, EL

10
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,950
engineering and software architecture.

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,870
So finally, you'll see how we lightweight
JavaScript core can scale to enterprise

12
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:45,150
with the performance, agility and
transparency our industry demands.

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,060
So let's go and deep
dive into our project.

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,750
What is the healthcare claims and what is
the current state and what is the impact?

15
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:53,575
So let go to the current state.

16
00:00:53,849 --> 00:00:57,269
So healthcare organization handles
millions of claims each month.

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,679
So each one must satisfy hundreds
of business and compliance rules

18
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,190
under the ANSI X 2 8 37 standard.

19
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:10,529
So the ANSI X two standard is a separate
format, which we develop the files to CMS.

20
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:13,735
It has a different structure and
large elements and that need to

21
00:01:13,735 --> 00:01:17,024
be satisfied, then only the file
is going be processed by the cms.

22
00:01:17,505 --> 00:01:19,005
So the challenge is not only the.

23
00:01:19,505 --> 00:01:23,524
Claim formats differ between
institutional, professional, and dental

24
00:01:23,524 --> 00:01:26,104
types, and every payer add its own edits.

25
00:01:26,704 --> 00:01:32,794
So in many environments, validation
is still manual or semi-manual

26
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:36,984
relying on rules, spreadsheets, or
legacy engines written years ago.

27
00:01:37,224 --> 00:01:40,279
So when new regulations that
are updating the systems can.

28
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,234
Take weeks, sometimes months.

29
00:01:43,684 --> 00:01:48,095
So the results, high rejection rates,
delayed payments and mounting costs.

30
00:01:48,514 --> 00:01:51,815
So staff spend hours correcting
data instead of focus on

31
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:54,095
patient care or analytics.

32
00:01:54,334 --> 00:01:58,024
So this stage, the stage for
a new approach on that agile

33
00:01:58,445 --> 00:01:59,854
rule drive and technology.

34
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:02,335
And now what will be the impact?

35
00:02:02,815 --> 00:02:08,005
So a reactor claim does not just
impact accounting, it disrupts

36
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:09,384
the entire revenue cycle.

37
00:02:09,655 --> 00:02:14,535
For example if you're sending a file
to CMS with 5,000 claims and one fail,

38
00:02:15,015 --> 00:02:18,415
one claim just file because of the
structure or some missing elements.

39
00:02:19,215 --> 00:02:20,055
File will be failed.

40
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:25,115
So what happens is when we get the we
get a nine, nine written file in which

41
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:29,225
we need to check and see what is the
failed component, and then we need to

42
00:02:29,825 --> 00:02:33,450
figure out what, whether the strict
structure issue or it's a data issue.

43
00:02:34,305 --> 00:02:36,405
Or, and then we need to send a clip.

44
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:40,425
So sometimes this may take one, one
day, two day, or weeks or months to

45
00:02:41,025 --> 00:02:43,905
figure out, because if it's a data
issue, we need to figure out from where

46
00:02:43,905 --> 00:02:48,035
the data is coming, need to update
the data from the source, and then

47
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:49,395
it should flow through the system.

48
00:02:49,845 --> 00:02:51,495
So there's a reason what happens.

49
00:02:51,645 --> 00:02:53,925
The study says studies shows that.

50
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,190
15 to 20% of the claims are denied
of first submission, and roughly one

51
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,110
third of those are never recovered.

52
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,780
That's billions of dollars
lost annually across the US

53
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,560
healthcare system, so each denial.

54
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,200
When claim is sent, which a denial
triggers a chain of manual tasks we need

55
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,630
to review, correct them and resubmit,
and often take 30 to 45 days to resolve.

56
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,080
It may take more also,
so not only certain time.

57
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,220
So meanwhile, provider cashflow
servers and client suffers while

58
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,180
the amount is not going from one
end, one floor to the other floor.

59
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,190
So by building smarter valuation
layers that detect errors before

60
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,260
claims reach the payer organizations.

61
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,855
Can reduce Nels by up to 70%.

62
00:03:38,215 --> 00:03:42,295
So violation is not about compliance,
it's about financial stability

63
00:03:42,535 --> 00:03:44,185
and operational efficiency.

64
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:49,035
So why is the JavaScript a centric
approach for an approach for

65
00:03:49,035 --> 00:03:52,245
violation so modern than JavaScript?

66
00:03:52,245 --> 00:03:57,705
Frameworks offer unprecedented flexibility
for building healthcare ation system.

67
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:02,070
Unlike monolithic solutions, a
modular just architecture enables.

68
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:07,460
Rapid operation, easy maintenance,
and seamless integration

69
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,590
with existing infrastructure.

70
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,460
This approach leverages
declarative business rule engines

71
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,215
that separate violation logic
from implementation details.

72
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:22,695
Developers can define rules in human
readable formats while a framework

73
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:26,085
handles execution, error handling,
and performance optimization.

74
00:04:26,585 --> 00:04:29,435
So the metadata driven
designs means violations.

75
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:35,060
Rules live as configuration rather than
hard code logic, enabling business to

76
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,200
participate in rule management without
requiring deep technical knowledge.

77
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,470
So what are the core violation
capabilities that we are gonna use

78
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,070
in this AI driven 8 37 transmissions?

79
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,940
So the four things we are going
to do is eligibility verification,

80
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,290
provider credentialing.

81
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,220
State logic coding accuracy.

82
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,720
So let's deep dive.

83
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,550
What is eligibility verification?

84
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,540
What is provider running?

85
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,680
And the other two things.

86
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,500
So let's explore the core validation
capitals and make this frame for

87
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,990
powerful practical for healthcare users.

88
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,850
So we begin with eligibility
verification in many claim system

89
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,740
error start because patient coverage
is not verified in real time.

90
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,935
Here a JavaScript player
connects directly to payer APIs.

91
00:05:23,435 --> 00:05:28,805
Confirming active coverage, benefit
limits and service eligibility before

92
00:05:28,805 --> 00:05:30,815
a claim ever lose the provided system.

93
00:05:31,325 --> 00:05:35,015
Think of it's an instant checkpoint
that reduces preventable den

94
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:36,485
denial right at the source.

95
00:05:36,995 --> 00:05:41,225
So if anything is missing or anything
is wrong in the claim, so in the

96
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:45,125
initial ation itself, we don't
even send the claim to the CMS.

97
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:49,175
So that way we initially check
from our system and then we rectify

98
00:05:49,175 --> 00:05:50,440
that, and then we deliver to the.

99
00:05:51,175 --> 00:05:51,775
CMS.

100
00:05:52,345 --> 00:05:53,905
That's how we save the time and money.

101
00:05:54,595 --> 00:05:56,935
And next is provider credentialing.

102
00:05:57,265 --> 00:06:02,725
So this step automatically validates
NPA numbers, licenses, tax, money

103
00:06:02,725 --> 00:06:07,220
codes, and vector status using
data from NPS or CAQH directories.

104
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,380
So when a provider's license
expires or the out of network, the

105
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,120
framework flags it immediately.

106
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,190
So manual lookup, no surprise later.

107
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,750
So that's fair.

108
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:21,220
If any NP is missing or NP is wrong, or
NP addresses missing or NP is unknown,

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,810
issues may be present in our system or,
but when you're directly calling the APIs

110
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:31,060
from NPS or cqs, so that way they'll be
always active and there'll be always a

111
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,875
primary address and physician address and
also the secondary address for those NPIs.

112
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:38,370
There be, there will be a little,
very little chance of failing the

113
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,410
claim with a missing NP or missing
address or missing tax money codes.

114
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,070
That way we can figure out the issues
before sending it to the CMS itself.

115
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,620
So then we have data logic violation.

116
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,530
This is where hundreds of common
timeline errors are caught.

117
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,460
It checks the dimension, dates
come before discharges, that

118
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,990
the dates of birth is realistic.

119
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,640
And that services fall
within timely filing limits.

120
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,980
Suppose if an encounter happens in
something of 2020 December, but he's

121
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,780
not he's enrolled somewhere in 2025
due to the system entry or something.

122
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,240
So basically the claim will
not be accepted because of

123
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,620
some data entry or somewhere.

124
00:07:14,995 --> 00:07:18,595
Some mismatch has been happening, so
we need to fix the date logics also.

125
00:07:19,015 --> 00:07:22,105
So these small details often
make or break claim acceptance.

126
00:07:22,405 --> 00:07:28,195
So the last comes the coding accuracy,
the engine coex, isolated 10, diagnosis,

127
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:32,995
C, pt, S, and HCPCS codes against
official code sets and modifier rules.

128
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:34,455
It even supports.

129
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:40,445
For example, making sure a C PT code
that requires A always includes and every

130
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:45,035
claim, whatever we are submitting, CMS
should have a C PT code, which is valid.

131
00:07:45,335 --> 00:07:48,935
So these CCPT codes or ICT
codes every year, CMS changes.

132
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:51,195
A few reschedule your non-schedule.

133
00:07:51,695 --> 00:07:52,835
Sometimes every year.

134
00:07:52,835 --> 00:07:54,095
CMS also saves you.

135
00:07:54,095 --> 00:07:58,715
I CD codes are retired, so we need to
make our system to be always updated.

136
00:07:58,715 --> 00:08:02,345
So that's the reason we bring it to the
configurations and we order, we add as

137
00:08:02,345 --> 00:08:05,745
in a violation check so that we don't
submit the invalid i CD codes here.

138
00:08:06,245 --> 00:08:08,974
CP should be a valid C PT code.

139
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:14,045
Collectively, these
modules form a 360 sheet.

140
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:16,295
They don't detect the problems.

141
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,175
Explain so teams.

142
00:08:19,675 --> 00:08:21,775
So now we'll go to the
architectural design.

143
00:08:22,255 --> 00:08:26,095
So now let's step back and
look how all these capabilities

144
00:08:26,095 --> 00:08:27,475
fit together technically.

145
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:33,815
So at the bottom sits the data ingestion
layer, the component read raw, a DA

146
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:39,204
thousand files, those long test streams,
full loss segments and loops, and converts

147
00:08:39,204 --> 00:08:40,765
them into structured Jason objects.

148
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:44,635
Once that happens, every
downstream service can read the

149
00:08:44,995 --> 00:08:46,405
data like standard key value.

150
00:08:46,905 --> 00:08:48,165
Frazzling with Iio syntax.

151
00:08:48,165 --> 00:08:53,355
So as we told in the beginning,
the ANSI 8 37 structure, so that

152
00:08:53,355 --> 00:08:58,245
structure is very tough to read unless
who has a lot of experience in the

153
00:08:58,245 --> 00:09:00,075
healthcare system or the claims level.

154
00:09:00,585 --> 00:09:04,605
The system has lot of loops and structures
that no one could understand easily.

155
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:06,975
So converting into the J object.

156
00:09:07,225 --> 00:09:12,085
That makes the user to read easily and
they can find out what data elements are

157
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,705
missing or some segments are missing.

158
00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:16,915
So now next, go to the rule engine code.

159
00:09:17,335 --> 00:09:18,835
This is a brain of the system.

160
00:09:19,345 --> 00:09:22,405
It pulls the right set of the
rules based on the claim type,

161
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:26,815
payer and line of business, because
the rules are metadata driven.

162
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:31,610
You can add, remove, or prioritize
them without touching the code base.

163
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:35,750
That flexibility is crucial
when regulations change.

164
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,510
So what happens is every year, as we told.

165
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,489
The iicd code will be changing some
np iicd code changing sometimes

166
00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:46,289
some code from risk adjustment
to non-risk adjustment code.

167
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:47,729
Some iicd code will be retiring.

168
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:52,229
So all these made as a configuration
that would be easy for the,

169
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:53,629
for our system to maintain.

170
00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:56,029
So then we have an integration service.

171
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:58,009
So these are external connectors.

172
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:03,594
Reach out to third party APIs or
databases, for example, to verify

173
00:10:03,594 --> 00:10:06,295
eligibility or NP details in real time.

174
00:10:06,444 --> 00:10:10,874
All of them run synchronously,
so even under heavy loads.

175
00:10:11,374 --> 00:10:13,084
And finally comes the response handler.

176
00:10:13,294 --> 00:10:18,004
Once violation is complete this module,
format the results to j XML or flat file

177
00:10:18,004 --> 00:10:20,584
and route them back to clearinghouse
data warehouse or B dashboard.

178
00:10:20,584 --> 00:10:21,164
So what's this?

179
00:10:21,584 --> 00:10:24,824
So once everything is done, all the
violations, vault IC code verification

180
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:25,964
is done, integration service.

181
00:10:25,964 --> 00:10:29,894
Then what this is again, the
j changes the it's file to

182
00:10:29,894 --> 00:10:32,494
the A 37 standard file format.

183
00:10:32,494 --> 00:10:35,885
And then send the file to the
clearing author, and the clearing

184
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,295
author will send the file to CMS.

185
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,895
And same data we can use in your
dashboards and the warehouses.

186
00:10:41,395 --> 00:10:45,699
So the anti designs follows a
microservice philosophy, so each component

187
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:48,010
scale fail or evolve independently.

188
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,800
That makes it future proof for
cloud deployments on AWS Lambda

189
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,510
Azure functions all Kubernetes.

190
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,185
So now let's go to.

191
00:10:56,685 --> 00:11:01,555
How as we discussed before, there
are like three multiple claim types.

192
00:11:01,825 --> 00:11:05,995
So out of them they're institutional,
professional, and dental.

193
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:11,575
So when you go to institutional hospital
and facility claims with complex

194
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:15,775
billing hierarchies, revenue codes,
and service line details requiring

195
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,245
sophisticated violation rules.

196
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:18,055
So what are the rules?

197
00:11:18,055 --> 00:11:18,535
They're having?

198
00:11:18,985 --> 00:11:19,860
Revenue code violation.

199
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,550
Board and discharge statistics.

200
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,760
So same way when you go to,
when you're coming to eight 30,

201
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,230
professional claim generation.

202
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,760
So physician outpatient services claims
with procedure codes is a mandated thing.

203
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,170
Procedure mod should be M and
place of service requirements.

204
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,890
Leading size violations shows
what requirements for institution,

205
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:41,469
what requirements for professional
and what requirements for dental.

206
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:44,640
So in the professional also,
place of services is mandatory

207
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,110
and modify combinations.

208
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,829
So because as our, as in the
COVID, we got telehealth.

209
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,000
So we have a, for a telehealth,
we need to specify, we have, we

210
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,469
are having spec specific modify.

211
00:11:55,469 --> 00:11:58,999
Then only the CMS knows
this is a telehealth claim.

212
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,540
If it's not, if it's something like
blank or, no, the CMS knows, okay,

213
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,300
it's not a telehealth claim, it's
an, it's an electronic or assessment.

214
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:09,430
That's how they, we can figure out how
it's, and the rendering provider checks.

215
00:12:09,845 --> 00:12:14,345
So whether the NPI is there or not,
and coming to Dental 8 30 70 dental

216
00:12:14,345 --> 00:12:18,665
procedure claims with tooth numbering
surfaces and specialized code requirements

217
00:12:18,665 --> 00:12:21,005
unique to dental practice management.

218
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:24,995
So it's tooth surface violation, CT
code accuracy, treatment plan logic.

219
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:29,195
So each claim type requires specialized
violation rule while sharing

220
00:12:29,195 --> 00:12:32,600
common infrastructure components,
making modular essential for.

221
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,890
So now here comes the real
time and batch processing.

222
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:40,390
So once architecture set, the
next question is how do we

223
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,890
run it effectively at scale?

224
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,150
That's where our dual
processing approach comes in.

225
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,610
Let's go to the realtime API valuation.

226
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:54,150
So process claims as they're submitted
through restful APIs with sub-second

227
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:59,310
response times ideal file clearing hoses,
integration practice management systems,

228
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:04,980
and immediate feedback scenarios where
providers need instant violation results.

229
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,290
So the API layer supports.

230
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,310
Both synchronous and asynchronous
patterns, allowing system to

231
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:15,450
choose between immediate responses
or queued processing based on

232
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,160
complexity and volume requirements.

233
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,340
Now get into the batch processing
engine, how it works, so it handle

234
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:26,510
engine volume, claim files during off
pick covers with parallel processing.

235
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,100
Perfect for end of day submissions,
large provider groups and

236
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,430
scenarios where throughput patterns
more than immediate response.

237
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,660
So the batch engine optimizes resource
utilization, truly inline job shape

238
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,690
during automatic logic and complement.

239
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,800
So error reporting.

240
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,650
That groups issues for
efficient remediation.

241
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,360
So another, what want to say is there's
two more design properties, flexibility

242
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,650
realtime, for instance, feedback and
batch for large scale operation loads.

243
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:57,340
So together they make the
system both fast and reliable.

244
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,960
So critical qualities in a 24 by seven
healthcare environment where ways the

245
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,400
data processing is going to be done.

246
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,630
We can also do for the further
preparation of AI integration.

247
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:12,090
So once we have a metadata driven
foundation, we can seamlessly add AI

248
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,920
capabilities without rebuilding anything.

249
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,860
So the first step is
intelligent rule adaption.

250
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,270
We can train machine learning models
on historical claim outcomes to

251
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,990
identify patterns if a certain rule s.

252
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,600
Recommend turning it or merging
it with contextual conditions.

253
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,720
Over time, the frameworks
learns from experience.

254
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,270
So the second is directive analysis.

255
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:39,500
A models evaluate incoming claims
and estimate the likelihood of

256
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,300
payer acceptance before submissions.

257
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,260
So high risk claims can be
flagged for manual review.

258
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,360
Suppose if you're getting a
high risk ED code or claim, or

259
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,400
h ccc, we just make this flag.

260
00:14:50,795 --> 00:14:53,225
To double check, and
then we send it to CMS.

261
00:14:53,495 --> 00:14:57,935
So while low risk ones flow strike
through, so this reduces manual

262
00:14:57,935 --> 00:15:00,395
intervention and accelerates
payments, supply cycles.

263
00:15:01,145 --> 00:15:06,325
The beauty is that the, a conce use the
same metadata as the rule, so the results

264
00:15:06,325 --> 00:15:10,465
remain reasonable and auditable a must
in regulator industries like healthcare.

265
00:15:10,795 --> 00:15:11,755
So in a healthcare.

266
00:15:12,155 --> 00:15:14,960
Any claim is submitted or any once
after you submitting the claim.

267
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,055
If return the ance and the ICN,
everything needs to be auditable because

268
00:15:19,515 --> 00:15:23,115
it all depends on the federal and
state government ities and everything.

269
00:15:23,205 --> 00:15:25,065
Each and everything need to be audited

270
00:15:25,565 --> 00:15:27,740
so we can also use our
future ready extensions.

271
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,820
The validation framework can
integrate with blockchain networks

272
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,330
to create immutable trails
of claim violation decisions.

273
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:41,570
This transparency builds trust between
payers and providers while ensuring

274
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,790
compliance with regulatory requirements.

275
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:48,820
Smart contracts can automate certain
violation steps and trigger payment

276
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,530
workflows when claims meet predefined
criteria, reducing processing

277
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,720
time and administrative overhead.

278
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,340
So decentralized violation rules can be
shared across the healthcare ecosystem.

279
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:05,445
Creating INDUSTRYWIDE standards while
maintaining organizational autonomy.

280
00:16:05,945 --> 00:16:09,725
So let's go through, as we wrap
up this session, let's pull

281
00:16:09,725 --> 00:16:12,905
everything together and reflect
on the key ideas we have covered.

282
00:16:13,445 --> 00:16:17,315
First, JavaScript has evolved
for beyond its front end rules.

283
00:16:17,735 --> 00:16:22,895
In this framework, it becomes a powerful
engine for healthcare data, forced,

284
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:26,015
modular and complexity, customizable.

285
00:16:26,105 --> 00:16:28,895
It's non-blocking, runtime,
and rich ecosystem.

286
00:16:29,015 --> 00:16:31,595
Make it perfect for real time.

287
00:16:32,095 --> 00:16:35,365
And more than JS frameworks provide
foundation for building a scalable

288
00:16:35,515 --> 00:16:39,175
8 37 violation that adapts to
changing business requirements

289
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,395
without architectural rewrites.

290
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:43,915
Just based on the confis, we can do this.

291
00:16:44,305 --> 00:16:47,275
And second is metadata driven design.

292
00:16:47,775 --> 00:16:49,455
Separate rules from the courts.

293
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:55,025
Business users can, MAL, can validate
law can manage validate logic

294
00:16:55,025 --> 00:16:58,745
through configuration, reducing
it dependency and accelerating

295
00:16:58,745 --> 00:17:00,635
response to payer rule changes.

296
00:17:01,385 --> 00:17:04,960
Third, API first architecture
is what ties it all together.

297
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,165
It lets this validation capabilities.

298
00:17:08,115 --> 00:17:11,775
Plugs seamlessly into
clearinghouse practice management

299
00:17:11,775 --> 00:17:13,485
systems and payer gateways.

300
00:17:13,785 --> 00:17:17,415
So whether data moves in real
time or in it batches, the system

301
00:17:17,415 --> 00:17:19,245
build consistent and predictable.

302
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:24,255
So fourth is the AI Ready Foundation
unlocks strategic transformation.

303
00:17:24,965 --> 00:17:29,045
AI brings break to intelligence,
learning from past outcomes to flag

304
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:30,935
potential denies before they occur.

305
00:17:31,205 --> 00:17:35,515
So while blockchain introduces verifiable
transparency, eliminating disputes,

306
00:17:35,515 --> 00:17:38,965
and building trust between payers
and the providers, what it does is,

307
00:17:39,265 --> 00:17:41,275
so if anything feels, it's like any.

308
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,610
It's a higher risk code or it seems
like it's a highly billable code.

309
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:50,170
So before sending it to CMS, we
just take a stop flag it, send

310
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,620
it to double review, and once it
is reviews done, we send the CMS.

311
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,845
That way, if it rejects, it
takes a lot of time to again.

312
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,590
Redo this so it's better before sending.

313
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,190
We do as a mechanism, we build a
mechanism where we can check before

314
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,200
sending the claim to the CMS.

315
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:11,090
So ulti ultimately this approach
transform this approach transforms

316
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:15,195
violations from a routine comprehensive
check pointers strategic capability that

317
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:19,635
drives financial performance, operational
efficiency, and patient satisfaction.

318
00:18:20,135 --> 00:18:23,435
The bigger message here is
that technology choices matter.

319
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:29,645
When we design systems that are modular,
explainable, and intelligent, we future

320
00:18:29,645 --> 00:18:34,415
proof not only our software, but also
the organizations that depend on it.

321
00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:37,685
Thank you again so much for
being part of this session.

322
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:41,645
I encourage you to experiment to think
differently about where JavaScripts

323
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:45,845
fits you in a data engineering world
and to connect with, and you can connect

324
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:49,435
with me in LinkedIn for continue to
further discussions on the healthcare.

325
00:18:50,065 --> 00:18:51,955
Thank you so much for
giving this opportunity.
