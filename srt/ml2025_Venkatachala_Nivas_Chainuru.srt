00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,050
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,670
Welcome to my talk.

3
00:00:04,109 --> 00:00:09,370
In this video I'm gonna talk about
revolutionizing the data management the

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:14,530
role of AI optimized block storage in
the exponential enterprise data growth.

5
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:19,285
So traditionally, the block
storage systems have operated

6
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:23,535
with static configurations and
manual management approaches.

7
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:28,085
However the recent growth in
the data volume and velocity

8
00:00:28,085 --> 00:00:32,345
has exposed the limitations in
these conventional approaches.

9
00:00:32,735 --> 00:00:38,060
The artificial intelligence optimized
block storage represents a transf shift.

10
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:44,209
Leveraging the machine learning algorithms
and advanced analytics to create an

11
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:49,910
intelligent and self-optimizing systems
that can handle the exponential growth

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:55,820
of enterprise data, which is projected
to go up to once of unstructured

13
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,880
structured and block storage data by 2025.

14
00:01:00,005 --> 00:01:03,634
Let's see more about the data
growth challenge that the IT

15
00:01:03,694 --> 00:01:05,465
industry is currently facing.

16
00:01:05,975 --> 00:01:11,975
So the modern storage infrastructure is
facing and very complex challenge as the

17
00:01:11,975 --> 00:01:14,945
volumes expanded unprecedented rates.

18
00:01:15,155 --> 00:01:18,155
So the enterprise data
centers are undergoing.

19
00:01:18,685 --> 00:01:24,185
A big transformation both in scale and
complexity with the global data sphere.

20
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:29,085
Not merely growing, but exploring
exponentially creating an immediate

21
00:01:29,085 --> 00:01:31,945
need for and adaptive solutions.

22
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:37,674
Three, three key sectors be it healthcare
industry and manufacturing industry With

23
00:01:37,704 --> 00:01:43,595
iot generated telemetry and financial
institutions with transaction records

24
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:49,265
and compliance documentations are at
the top most forefront for this data.

25
00:01:49,265 --> 00:01:52,135
Critical applications are stringent.

26
00:01:53,485 --> 00:01:56,485
Their medic, their mission
critical applications are stringent

27
00:01:56,935 --> 00:01:58,825
and regulatory requirement.

28
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:05,365
Their mission critical applications
and regulatory requirements, demand

29
00:02:05,785 --> 00:02:10,195
storage solutions that go beyond
traditional approaches, caring for

30
00:02:10,195 --> 00:02:15,034
intelligence driven architecture that
can anticipate growth patterns and

31
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,049
optimize the resources dynamically.

32
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:24,019
So this, the, one of the solutions for
this data growth challenges are artificial

33
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:29,039
intelligence driven, storage management,
evolution integrating artificial

34
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,049
intelligence into storage architectures.

35
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:35,639
I. Brings a fundamental shift in the
enterprise data management strategy.

36
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:41,489
The modern artificial intelligence
enhance the storage systems continuously

37
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:43,769
monitor, analyze and performance.

38
00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:48,099
Analyze the performance metrics
so significantly reduces the time

39
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:52,114
required for management, operational,
and troubleshooting tasks.

40
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,359
Let's talk about how artificial
intelligence and its predictive analytics

41
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:03,239
framework bring us like, the extra
benefits the artificial intelligence

42
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,369
optimized block storage systems.

43
00:03:05,369 --> 00:03:09,379
I. Employ sophisticated they
have a sophisticated predictive

44
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:14,119
analytics that revolutionize the
enterprise data management by analy.

45
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:17,239
By analyzing this predictive
analytics, what it does is

46
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:18,499
it analyzes the historical.

47
00:03:19,024 --> 00:03:22,534
Usage patterns and workload
characteristics and

48
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:24,154
infrastructure telemetry.

49
00:03:24,374 --> 00:03:28,384
These intelligent systems
generate actionable insights

50
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,034
in real time applications.

51
00:03:30,364 --> 00:03:35,274
This predictive analytics capability
dramatically improves the storage

52
00:03:35,274 --> 00:03:42,434
utilization rates from an industry
average of 48% to 72% while reducing

53
00:03:42,434 --> 00:03:44,834
the procurement cost up to 35%.

54
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:49,339
Through precision capacity planning
and intelligence resource allocation,

55
00:03:50,339 --> 00:03:52,559
intelligent data tiering architecture.

56
00:03:53,054 --> 00:03:58,634
A driven storage systems implemented
sophisticated multi-tiered architectures

57
00:03:59,054 --> 00:04:04,934
that automatically optimizes optimize data
placement based upon the access patterns

58
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,514
and also the performance requirements.

59
00:04:07,784 --> 00:04:12,104
This intelligent approach to data tiering
has delivered substantial benefits.

60
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:18,294
In both cost efficiency and performance
with the organizations achieving storage

61
00:04:18,294 --> 00:04:23,334
cost reduction between most of the
organization has achieved a cost reduction

62
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:27,114
between 19 to up to 30, 37 percentage.

63
00:04:28,114 --> 00:04:34,174
This intelligent data tiering is
applied on a hybrid storage where the

64
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:40,585
storage system has 15 to have five to
15% of high performance storage disks.

65
00:04:40,624 --> 00:04:47,104
Rest of them with a mix of standard sssts
and, high capacity storage drives and also

66
00:04:47,144 --> 00:04:50,644
in archival storage with cheaper cost.

67
00:04:50,794 --> 00:04:55,614
So what we, what this intelligent
data tiering does is it combines the

68
00:04:55,614 --> 00:05:00,504
whole storage as a single package, and
then these intelligent all algorithms

69
00:05:00,504 --> 00:05:05,514
will move the data between different
tiers based upon the usage and based

70
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:08,004
upon the performance requirements.

71
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:11,469
Performance optimization engine.

72
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:16,269
So the modern artificial intelligence
driven storage system employ a

73
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:20,859
sophisticated optimization engines
that continuously monitor and

74
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:22,749
adapt to changing the workloads.

75
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:27,219
These autonomous systems represent
a significant evolution in storage

00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:31,749
management, simultaneously analyzing
and adjusting multiple configuration

77
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:32,829
parameters in the real time.

78
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:36,139
Let's see more about let's see.

79
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:41,419
What are the implementation challenges
implementation challenges in achieving

80
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:43,649
this AI driven storage solution?

81
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:49,069
Multi-layered MO in multi-layered
monitoring, combining the infrastructure

82
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:53,269

00:05:59,044 --> 00:06:04,474
And optimization decisions and higher
in high resolution performance tracking,

85
00:06:04,744 --> 00:06:09,994
capturing detailed metrics through agent
based and agentless collection methods.

86
00:06:10,374 --> 00:06:15,774
Enabling precision correlation of
events across the technology stack of

87
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,294
early detection and potential issues.

88
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:20,964
Block level meta data collection.

89
00:06:21,224 --> 00:06:26,434
Gathering a detailed operational data
includes the timestamps, operation

00:06:42,344 --> 00:06:46,904
edge processing capabilities to
optimize a bandwidth utilization.

94
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,179
While preserving analytical capabilities.

95
00:06:51,364 --> 00:06:55,434
Let's see more about implementing
strategies, using machine learning

96
00:06:55,434 --> 00:06:59,474
techniques under supervised
learning particularly effective

97
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:01,574
in predictive failure analysis.

98
00:07:01,694 --> 00:07:06,504
These models analyze patterns in
device health metrics to identify

99
00:07:06,504 --> 00:07:10,194
potential hardware failures
before they impact operations.

100
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:15,234
The accuracy of these predictions
show continuous improvements.

101
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:20,759
As the models incorporate more
historical failure data and

102
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,439
refine their future selection.

workload patterns by analyzing iwo
characteristics, including request

105
00:07:33,934 --> 00:07:40,184
size read and write ratios and
temporal patterns this capability

106
00:07:40,184 --> 00:07:42,314
proves especially valuable.

107
00:07:42,814 --> 00:07:46,984
In dynamic environments where new
applications are frequently deployed

108
00:07:47,314 --> 00:07:53,364
with changing requirements, reinforcement
learning enables continuous optimization

109
00:07:53,364 --> 00:07:59,484
of complex storage parameters by treating
storage management as decision process.

Evaluation, evaluating actions
based on their impact on

111
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:05,619
system performance metrics.

112
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:10,389
This approach has shown particular
success in environments with changing

113
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:14,969
workload characteristics, often
discovering optimization strategies

114
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:17,459
that surpasses traditional approaches.

115
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:23,909
Let's see how an enterprise environment
strategize in, integrate in, in, in

116
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:25,309
the machine learning integration.

117
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:30,579
So the storage virtualization layer
creates an abstract creating an

118
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:34,479
abstraction layer that gradually
introduces artificial inter

119
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,029
intelligence optimization capabilities
alongside existing storage systems,

120
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:44,829
allowing organizations to target
specific workloads for optimization.

121
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:48,749
While maintaining an existing
operations for less critical systems.

122
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:52,669
We can also have an API based integration.

123
00:08:52,944 --> 00:08:58,564
Leveraging API Connections to coordinate
storage optimization with broader IT

124
00:08:59,284 --> 00:09:05,364

While enabling automated responses
to changing application requirements,

127
00:09:13,924 --> 00:09:17,904
a phased approach, also a phased
approach which is like beginning with

128
00:09:17,964 --> 00:09:23,764
monitoring an analytics functions before
enabling automated actions, allowing

129
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:28,994
organizations to validate model accuracy
and build operational confidence with

130
00:09:28,994 --> 00:09:31,514
maintaining a clear fallback procedures.

131
00:09:31,609 --> 00:09:37,969

Modern AI driven storage
systems excel at optimizing.

135
00:09:55,565 --> 00:10:01,495
Capacity allocation through continuous
monitoring and analysis of usage patterns.

136
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:07,825
The operational benefits extend well
beyond cost reduction and encompassing

137
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:12,565
significant improvements in reliability
and performance consistency.

138
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,630
Advance in monitoring systems track
hundreds of performance metrics

139
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:23,350
simultaneously enabling early detection
of any potential issues before.

140
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,810
They impact a critical service.

141
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:24,839
I.

142
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,229
With the current trend seeing industry
