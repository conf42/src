1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,850
Good morning, good afternoon, good
evening, depending upon where you are

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,040
and when you're watching this recording.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,510
Thank you for joining me today.

4
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,350
My name is Robin Sarkar.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,070
I'm the director of analytics
and digital at Enstal.

6
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:19,930
I'm very excited today to discuss
something that fuels our lives

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,820
every single day, yet rarely
gets the spotlight it deserves.

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,080
Data.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,690
Think of data like water, it's
everywhere, for survival, and yet

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,900
too much of it can cause floods,
while too little leaves us parched.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:43,679
The key is not just having data, but
managing it wisely, turning it into

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,640
something actionable and valuable.

13
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,740
Today I'm here to talk about data portals.

14
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,890
I know that name doesn't scream
excitement, but trust me, by the

15
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,725
end of this session, you will see
how data portals can make your

16
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:02,525
organization smarter, faster,
and yes, even more profitable.

17
00:01:03,025 --> 00:01:03,765
So let's dive in.

18
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:05,475
Here's what we'll cover today.

19
00:01:05,975 --> 00:01:10,614
First, I'll introduce data portals,
what they are, why they matter.

20
00:01:11,045 --> 00:01:13,055
Next, we'll explore their key features.

21
00:01:13,485 --> 00:01:16,274
Then we'll discuss their key benefits.

22
00:01:16,394 --> 00:01:17,554
Spoiler alert.

23
00:01:18,174 --> 00:01:23,134
It means faster decisions, happier
employees, and improved business outcomes.

24
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:26,494
But let's be real, it's not all perfect.

25
00:01:26,814 --> 00:01:31,444
I'll also touch on common challenges
organizations face when adopting

26
00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:35,114
data portals, and of course,
the solutions to navigate them.

27
00:01:35,614 --> 00:01:40,424
Finally, we'll end with key takeaways
and some thought provoking questions

28
00:01:40,824 --> 00:01:46,244
to help you reflect on how data portals
could transform your organization.

29
00:01:46,744 --> 00:01:47,244
Sounds good?

30
00:01:47,744 --> 00:01:48,374
Let's get started.

31
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:51,644
The world is drowning in data.

32
00:01:52,144 --> 00:02:00,034
Fun fact, by 2025, the global data
sphere will hit 175 zettabytes.

33
00:02:00,814 --> 00:02:04,834
That's 175 trillion gigabytes.

34
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:08,994
Imagine if every byte
were a grain of rice.

35
00:02:09,674 --> 00:02:14,954
We would have enough to bury
Mount Everest several times over.

36
00:02:15,454 --> 00:02:21,284
Yet, despite this abundance, many
organizations struggle to harness

37
00:02:21,494 --> 00:02:23,244
the full value of their data.

38
00:02:23,664 --> 00:02:26,884
It's like having closet
stuffed with clothes.

39
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:30,399
But never being able to
find your favorite shirt.

40
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:32,829
That sounds familiar, right?

41
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:35,109
This is where data portals comes in.

42
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:40,039
Think of data portal as your super
organized friend, Marie Kondo.

43
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:45,929
Consolidating all your data into
one place and making it easy.

44
00:02:46,484 --> 00:02:47,574
To find and use.

45
00:02:48,024 --> 00:02:49,484
It's not just storage.

46
00:02:49,564 --> 00:02:52,994
It's about turning chaos into clarity.

47
00:02:53,494 --> 00:02:58,424
Imagine a retail company with data
spread across sales, inventory,

48
00:02:58,464 --> 00:03:00,704
customer support, and marketing systems.

49
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:06,414
Without a data portal, pulling these
pieces together for insight is time

50
00:03:06,414 --> 00:03:09,404
consuming and often inconsistent.

51
00:03:10,194 --> 00:03:14,089
With a data portal, this data is
consolidating, and Allowing the

52
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:18,579
company to quickly identify trends
like customer purchasing behaviors,

53
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:24,689
inventory shortages, or the success of
marketing campaigns, all in real time.

54
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:30,679
What sets data portals apart is
their unique combination of features

55
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:32,489
to address real world challenges.

56
00:03:32,899 --> 00:03:36,319
First, there is a centralized repository.

57
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,489
Imagine all your data.

58
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:43,749
Whether it's sales, customer
feedback, or operational metrics

59
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:45,719
consolidated in one place.

60
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,459
If you're in the healthcare
industry, patient records, lab

61
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:56,119
results, or billing information are
often scattered across the system.

62
00:03:56,619 --> 00:04:00,269
A data portal can centralize the
sources, ensuring the healthcare

63
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:04,389
providers have accurate up to date
information at their fingertips,

64
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:07,349
which directly improves patient care.

65
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,369
Everything is in one place.

66
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,919
And no more hunting through 10 different
systems like you're in a treasure hunt.

67
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:18,329
Self service analytics is a game
changer for non technical users.

68
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:25,279
Remember when you had to call data or
IT team every time you needed a report?

69
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:26,819
Those days are over.

70
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:31,434
With intuitive dashboards, Even
the least tech savvy person in

71
00:04:31,434 --> 00:04:33,334
the office can pull insights.

72
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:37,724
It's like upgrading from a
flip phone to a smartphone.

73
00:04:37,804 --> 00:04:40,144
It just makes life easier.

74
00:04:40,844 --> 00:04:42,714
Third, we have data governance.

75
00:04:42,874 --> 00:04:47,124
As organization grows, so does
the need to secure sensitive

76
00:04:47,124 --> 00:04:48,974
data and comply with regulations.

77
00:04:49,524 --> 00:04:50,684
Sounds boring, right?

78
00:04:50,934 --> 00:04:52,284
But it's crucial.

79
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:57,949
It's like having a security guard
for your data, making sure sensitive

80
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:00,179
information doesn't fall into wrong hands.

81
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,419
Then there is search and discovery.

82
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:07,839
Advanced search capabilities means
employees can find their data in seconds.

83
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:10,189
Imagine an analyst looking for sales.

84
00:05:10,624 --> 00:05:14,874
data for specific region last quarter,
they can simply search and access

85
00:05:14,874 --> 00:05:16,494
the relevant data set instantly.

86
00:05:17,474 --> 00:05:19,834
Finally, let's talk about
collaboration tools.

87
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:23,834
Imagine you're in marketing
and you notice sales are up in

88
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:25,464
one region but down another.

89
00:05:26,444 --> 00:05:30,034
Instead of sending 50 emails back
and forth, you can share your

90
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:32,614
insights directly in the portal.

91
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:36,504
Tag your sales team and work
on the solutions together.

92
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:37,454
All right.

93
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:40,904
Let's talk about the
juicy part, the benefits.

94
00:05:41,044 --> 00:05:45,694
first up is, it enables
faster decision making.

95
00:05:46,234 --> 00:05:51,154
Picture this, you're a product manager
who needs to decide whether to continue

96
00:05:51,174 --> 00:05:52,814
producing a slow selling product.

97
00:05:53,314 --> 00:05:58,864
Without a data portal, they would spend
weeks gathering the information, but with

98
00:05:58,864 --> 00:06:04,124
one, they can see sales trends, customer
feedback, and inventory levels in minutes,

99
00:06:05,034 --> 00:06:07,434
and boom, a decision is being made.

100
00:06:08,154 --> 00:06:11,664
Next up is The improved data literacy.

101
00:06:12,134 --> 00:06:16,924
You know how most people free data
like it's written in Hebrew data

102
00:06:16,924 --> 00:06:21,994
portals change that they make data
accessible and easy to understand

103
00:06:22,034 --> 00:06:24,354
even for the non technical folks.

104
00:06:24,644 --> 00:06:30,794
For example, an HR manager could use
a portal to track employee performance

105
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:35,304
and employee engagement and more,
engagement trends without needing

106
00:06:35,304 --> 00:06:37,014
a data scientist on speed dial.

107
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:42,619
And by automating repetitive tasks
like data extraction and cleaning,

108
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:46,969
data portals allow IT teams to
focus on strategic initiatives,

109
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:49,569
boosting overall productivity.

110
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:55,469
This doesn't just benefit IT, it creates
a ripple effect across the organization.

111
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:57,799
Collaboration is another big win.

112
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:02,459
Let's say the marketing team wants to run
a campaign targeting a specific audience.

113
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:06,999
Instead of guessing, they can pull
customer insights from the portal,

114
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:12,989
share them with design team, and
create a campaign backed by data.

115
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:16,199
It's teamwork powered by technology.

116
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:17,999
Here's the thing about data.

117
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:22,399
It's only useful if you can
access it quickly and easily.

118
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:24,609
That's where data portals shine.

119
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:28,039
First, they simplify data discovery.

120
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,379
Instead of digging through 10
folders or sending panicked attacks,

121
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:37,289
panicked emails to IT, you can
find what you need in seconds.

122
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:39,659
They also democratize data.

123
00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:43,809
That's a fancy way of saying
they make data accessible to

124
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:45,419
everyone, not just data nerds.

125
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:50,624
A junior employee in customer
service Identifies a recurring

126
00:07:50,624 --> 00:07:52,234
complaint pattern using the portal.

127
00:07:52,504 --> 00:07:57,424
They share it with their manager, who
then brings it up in a strategy meeting.

128
00:07:58,184 --> 00:08:01,924
Suddenly, the junior
employee is the office hero.

129
00:08:02,704 --> 00:08:05,314
Then there is data
quality and consistency.

130
00:08:05,714 --> 00:08:10,634
When all teams draw the data
from same single source.

131
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:15,874
Source of truth, discrepancy and
errors are significantly reduced.

132
00:08:16,244 --> 00:08:18,834
So finally, let's talk
about real time access.

133
00:08:19,314 --> 00:08:24,364
In today's fast paced world, waiting
for outdated report is like trying

134
00:08:24,364 --> 00:08:26,794
to run a marathon in flip flops.

135
00:08:26,994 --> 00:08:28,094
It just doesn't work.

136
00:08:28,284 --> 00:08:31,924
Real time data helps companies
respond to changes instantly.

137
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:36,934
For example, If a retailer notices
a spike in demand for a product,

138
00:08:37,344 --> 00:08:41,434
they can restock quickly, avoiding
missed sales opportunities.

139
00:08:41,934 --> 00:08:46,834
Data portals don't just make
your life easier, they transform

140
00:08:47,134 --> 00:08:48,674
how businesses operate.

141
00:08:49,174 --> 00:08:51,054
Let's start with faster decisions.

142
00:08:51,214 --> 00:08:57,914
With all your data in one place, decision
making becomes quick and confident.

143
00:08:58,134 --> 00:09:05,419
Imagine a CEO needing to decide whether to
expand into New market, instead of relying

144
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:10,299
on gut feelings, they have a portal
filled with market analysis, customer

145
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,559
demographics, and competitor insights.

146
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:17,139
It enables them to make the
decision faster and quicker.

147
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:19,729
Now let's discuss data driven culture.

148
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:25,939
Data portals make it easier for
organizations to foster a culture

149
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:28,089
of data driven decision making.

150
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:33,669
Companies that embrace the culture
outperform their competitors financially

151
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:39,489
by 49 percent and are 178 percent more
likely to achieve long term success.

152
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:40,309
Why?

153
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:45,549
Because their decisions are
based on facts, not hunches.

154
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:50,059
And all we know is that facts don't lie.

155
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:52,169
Finally, customer insights.

156
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,089
Data portals help you understand
your customers better.

157
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:01,379
For example, Fitness company could
use one to identify which classes

158
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:04,909
are most popular, then adjust
their schedule to meet demand.

159
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:10,599
The result, happier customer
means happier retention rates.

160
00:10:11,099 --> 00:10:14,889
The benefits of data portals
don't just improve process.

161
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:19,429
They create ripple effects
across the entire organization.

162
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:22,409
Let's dive into some real world impacts.

163
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:26,429
Let's talk about customer
acquisition and retention.

164
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:27,549
Did you know?

165
00:10:27,884 --> 00:10:31,544
Do you know that companies leveraging
data portals are 23 times more

166
00:10:31,544 --> 00:10:36,344
likely to acquire customers and six
times more likely to retain them?

167
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:39,834
It's like having a crystal
ball for customer behavior.

168
00:10:40,334 --> 00:10:45,464
For example, a telecom company using
a data portal might notice younger

169
00:10:45,464 --> 00:10:52,064
employees, or sorry, younger customers
prefer online support over phone calls.

170
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:56,934
By enhancing online support, they
make their customers happier.

171
00:10:57,434 --> 00:10:58,424
Isn't that the goal?

172
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:01,244
Next, let's discuss profitability.

173
00:11:01,624 --> 00:11:06,024
Data driven organizations are
19 times more likely to achieve

174
00:11:06,344 --> 00:11:08,004
above average profitability.

175
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:12,254
Picture a manufacturing company
using real time data to optimize

176
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,154
production schedules and reduce waste.

177
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:19,109
Every decision becomes a little
smarter and the savings add up quickly.

178
00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:22,169
And then there is
operational optimization.

179
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:26,599
Companies report a 30 percent boost
in efficiency thanks to data portals.

180
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:30,459
Imagine a supply chain
manager tracking inventory and

181
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:32,389
forecasting demand in real time.

182
00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:37,939
By proactively addressing potential
bottlenecks, they save time,

183
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:40,399
money, and a lot of headaches.

184
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,949
Smooth operations aren't just
a dream, they're achievable.

185
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:50,919
Ultimately, these improvements make
organizations more agile, competitive,

186
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:53,269
and ready to tackle the future.

187
00:11:53,729 --> 00:11:56,809
Data portals aren't just
tools, they are game changers.

188
00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:01,589
Of course, data portals
isn't all smooth sailing.

189
00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:04,279
Every great tool comes
with its challenges.

190
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:06,609
First up, Data security.

191
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:12,909
It's a biggie with 67 percent of
organizations citing it as a top concern.

192
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:16,229
It's clear this issue keeps many I.

193
00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:16,399
T.

194
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,339
Professionals up at night.

195
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:19,389
Think about it.

196
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:25,949
Single breach can cost millions of
dollars and it also has a reputational

197
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:27,449
impact on the organization.

198
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:30,409
Next is user adoption.

199
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,319
As change is hard.

200
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:36,329
We all know someone who still
refuses to use an online calendar.

201
00:12:37,219 --> 00:12:42,719
Only 20 percent of employees feel
confident in their data literacy skills.

202
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:44,349
Then there's data quality.

203
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,419
It's like garbage in and garbage out.

204
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:52,299
Poor quality data is like
using GPS without dated maps.

205
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:55,749
You're not going to end up any end
up anywhere where you want to be.

206
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:59,539
Finally, there's also
an issue of scalability.

207
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:03,389
As your organization grows,
so will your data needs.

208
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:07,889
Now that we have outlined
challenges, let's talk solutions.

209
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:12,479
Every obstacle is just an
opportunity in disguise, right?

210
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:15,379
we discussed about data security.

211
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:18,729
it's best to implement a zero trust model.

212
00:13:19,229 --> 00:13:23,879
This means every user and device
Assessing your data must be verified.

213
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:24,949
No exceptions.

214
00:13:25,219 --> 00:13:29,709
Add encryption and regular audits
to the mix and you've got a security

215
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,599
system Fort Knox would let me.

216
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:36,189
For user adoption, training is
key, but don't make it boring.

217
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:39,339
Tailoring the training to different roles.

218
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,139
For example, HR team learns to track
employee engagement trends while marketing

219
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:47,359
explores campaign performance dashboards.

220
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:50,834
Everyone feels empowered
and no one feels left out.

221
00:13:51,334 --> 00:13:57,784
Data quality can be tackled with automated
data cleansing tools that spot and fix

222
00:13:57,784 --> 00:13:59,684
errors before they reach the portal.

223
00:14:00,164 --> 00:14:04,904
Combine that with clear data governance
policies, you will ensure your data

224
00:14:04,914 --> 00:14:06,654
remains accurate and actionable.

225
00:14:07,294 --> 00:14:09,274
Finally, there's scalability.

226
00:14:09,664 --> 00:14:12,294
Cloud based solutions are a no brainer.

227
00:14:12,794 --> 00:14:15,544
Imagine you're a retailer
launching a hot new product.

228
00:14:15,904 --> 00:14:21,444
A cloud based portal lets you
handle the surge in data seamlessly,

229
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:24,164
ensuring you don't miss a single sale.

230
00:14:24,774 --> 00:14:29,404
This solution proves that
with the right approach, data

231
00:14:29,424 --> 00:14:32,044
portals can overcome any hurdle.

232
00:14:32,544 --> 00:14:34,704
Finally, we're coming to end of it.

233
00:14:35,044 --> 00:14:36,484
We've covered a lot today.

234
00:14:36,984 --> 00:14:39,664
Let's take a moment to
recap the key points.

235
00:14:40,164 --> 00:14:44,164
Data portals are transformative
tools that centralize data,

236
00:14:44,944 --> 00:14:50,794
improve accessibility, and empower
organizations to make smarter decisions.

237
00:14:51,294 --> 00:14:55,904
From features like self service analytics
to their ability to drive profitability

238
00:14:55,954 --> 00:15:00,024
and efficiency, they're changing
the game for business everywhere.

239
00:15:00,724 --> 00:15:05,854
We discuss the challenges like
security concerns of user adoption.

240
00:15:06,494 --> 00:15:10,214
But with tailored training, robust
governance and scalable solutions,

241
00:15:10,234 --> 00:15:13,064
these obstacles are entirely manageable.

242
00:15:13,564 --> 00:15:16,674
So before we wrap up, let's
take a moment to reflect.

243
00:15:17,404 --> 00:15:21,094
If this were a live session,
I would invite your questions.

244
00:15:21,104 --> 00:15:22,804
So here's my question to you.

245
00:15:23,614 --> 00:15:27,924
How can your organization leverage a
data portal to foster collaboration,

246
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:32,954
drive better outcomes, and create
a truly data driven culture?

247
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:35,004
Thank you for your time and attention.

248
00:15:35,464 --> 00:15:39,914
And I hope this session has inspired
you to explore the possibilities of data

249
00:15:39,914 --> 00:15:46,684
portals and the transformative impact
they can have on your organizations.

250
00:15:47,184 --> 00:15:48,474
Thank you so much for your time.

251
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:50,224
Have a great day.

252
00:15:50,314 --> 00:15:50,644
Bye bye.
