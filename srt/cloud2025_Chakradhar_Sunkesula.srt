00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,120
Hello everyone and welcome
to my presentation.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,890
My name is Chakradar Sunkeswala and I
am engineering manager and specializing

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,180
in cloud infrastructure and security.

4
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:14,489
Today I want to share insights about
building a multi layered security

5
00:00:14,489 --> 00:00:19,119
framework that not only addresses
today's threats but also scales for the

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,449
challenges we face in 2025 and beyond.

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,380
Why multi layered security?

8
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:26,985
Because the threat landscape
is more dynamic than ever.

9
00:00:27,315 --> 00:00:31,065
Attackers are constantly probing
networks, APIs, and user endpoints

10
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:32,775
looking for the weakest links.

11
00:00:33,065 --> 00:00:37,785
If you rely on only one or two
security controls, sooner or

12
00:00:37,785 --> 00:00:39,615
later something will slip through.

13
00:00:39,965 --> 00:00:45,265
But, by using a series of defenses
that reinforce each other, you reduce a

14
00:00:45,265 --> 00:00:46,735
risk that a single breach can escalate.

15
00:00:47,235 --> 00:00:51,425
During this talk, we'll explore the core
components of such a framework, ranging

16
00:00:51,425 --> 00:00:57,925
from network security to AI driven threat
detection to zero trust and beyond.

17
00:00:58,495 --> 00:01:03,774
By the end, you will have a practical
understanding of how each piece fits

18
00:01:03,774 --> 00:01:07,694
together to create a robust shield
around your cloud infrastructure.

19
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:12,374
Over the past few years, the cloud
computing market has grown tremendously,

20
00:01:12,664 --> 00:01:17,680
increasing into The hundreds of billions
of dollars in value and projected to keep

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,380
expanding at over 20 percent annually
with so many organizations migrating

22
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,790
critical applications to the cloud.

23
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:26,360
It's clear that security
must be the paramount.

24
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,750
The main challenge is that this
rapid growth has dramatically

25
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:32,110
increased the attack surface.

26
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,860
Each new app, each new data
store, each new endpoint becomes

27
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,110
a potential vulnerability.

28
00:01:38,835 --> 00:01:42,985
Some reports indicate that nearly 43
percent of businesses have experienced

29
00:01:43,325 --> 00:01:46,685
at least one significant cloud
security incident in the past one year.

30
00:01:47,685 --> 00:01:53,155
The biggest culprit, culprits,
misconfiguration, inadequate

31
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,934
identity management, and
lack of effective monitoring.

32
00:01:56,475 --> 00:02:00,135
In this environment, reactive security
strategies like patching after

33
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:01,635
the breach are simply not enough.

34
00:02:02,195 --> 00:02:03,355
We need to be proactive.

35
00:02:03,815 --> 00:02:07,845
Layered defenses capable, layered
defenses capable of identifying,

36
00:02:08,025 --> 00:02:09,884
isolating, and neutralizing the threats.

37
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:12,615
Before they cause any real damage.

38
00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:14,325
That's the focus of this framework.

39
00:02:14,815 --> 00:02:19,895
Systematically reducing the risk across
every layer of your cloud environment.

40
00:02:20,395 --> 00:02:24,875
Let's break down how a multi layered
framework is typically structured.

41
00:02:25,494 --> 00:02:26,885
We look at several layers.

42
00:02:27,044 --> 00:02:31,005
Network security, where we implement
firewalls, intrusion, detection,

43
00:02:31,035 --> 00:02:33,585
prevention systems and segment networks.

44
00:02:34,175 --> 00:02:35,555
Authentication and authorization.

45
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:36,865
Zero trust methods.

46
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:39,989
least privilege and strong
identity verification.

47
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:42,269
API security and monitoring.

48
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:46,219
Checking each request with
intelligent validation systems.

49
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,669
AI driven threat detection, machine
learning models spotting anomalies in

50
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:56,899
real time, resilience and recovery,
built in failovers, and rapid incident

51
00:02:56,899 --> 00:02:59,009
response, and a thorough documentation.

52
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:03,319
By interlocking these layers, we
ensure no single point of failure.

53
00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:08,420
The impact can be profound, studies how
organizations adopting these strategies

54
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:12,470
often see major reductions, sometimes
up to 90 percent in successful breaches.

55
00:03:13,255 --> 00:03:16,825
They also report faster resolution
times and improved compliance.

56
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,980
Ultimately, robust security isn't
just about avoiding the attacks.

57
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,900
It's about fostering innovation
by enabling the teams to focus on

58
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:31,920
building great products without
constantly being worried about threats.

59
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,869
Let's talk, let's look
at network security.

60
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:43,010
Traditionally, every company tries to
protect a single perimeter, assuming

61
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,100
that everything inside could be trusted.

62
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,569
But that model fails in the cloud.

63
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,790
Today, attacks might originate internally
or come through compromised endpoints.

64
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,010
That's why we are shifting
to a zero trust model.

65
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:59,954
Where no user or a device
is implicitly trusted.

66
00:04:00,845 --> 00:04:04,864
In a zero trust architecture, each
request, whether it comes from,

67
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:10,024
coming from inside your network or
outside, must be continuously verified.

68
00:04:10,494 --> 00:04:15,204
We integrate AI driven traffic
analysis to spot unusual behaviors.

69
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,180
behavior patterns.

70
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:23,579
For instance, if a user activity suddenly
spikes at 3 a. m. in the morning from

71
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:29,179
the country where you have no operations,
we flag it or block it automatically.

72
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,199
Additionally, setting up a trip voice in
the network layer is highly effective.

73
00:04:34,694 --> 00:04:38,275
These are specific threshold or
conditions that trigger alarms.

74
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:42,775
For example, if the data exfiltration
exceeds a certain rate, or a

75
00:04:42,775 --> 00:04:46,814
sensitive resource is accessed
unexpectedly, it sets off an alarm.

76
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:51,375
The swift response prevents attacker
from moving freely once they are in.

77
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,615
The next critical layer is authentication.

78
00:04:54,115 --> 00:04:58,285
Compromised credentials remain one
of the top vectors for breaches.

79
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:02,395
Therefore, we employ multi factor,
multi factored authentication,

80
00:05:02,874 --> 00:05:06,454
short lived tokens, and strong
identity verification protocols.

81
00:05:06,954 --> 00:05:09,774
We also classify users
and devices based on risk.

82
00:05:10,564 --> 00:05:15,464
A low risk user operating from a
known location might only need a

83
00:05:15,464 --> 00:05:17,374
single factor of authentication.

84
00:05:17,794 --> 00:05:22,734
But a privileged administrator signing
in from a new or suspicious location

85
00:05:22,924 --> 00:05:27,244
might require multiple steps, such as one
time password or biometric verification.

86
00:05:28,024 --> 00:05:33,264
If we detect or suspect a compromised
token, we have an automatic kill switch.

87
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:36,494
That revokes session
tokens across the board.

88
00:05:37,094 --> 00:05:42,344
This prevents attackers from leveraging
stolen credentials for extended periods.

89
00:05:43,154 --> 00:05:47,414
Ultimately, trying an authentication,
tightly to the contextual risks,

90
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:53,114
ensures that only legitimate users
gain access and only to what they

91
00:05:53,114 --> 00:05:54,944
specifically need to do their job.

92
00:05:55,444 --> 00:06:00,844
Once the users are authenticated, the next
step is to ensure, to ensuring they are

93
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:03,064
only having the correct level of access.

94
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:08,504
We employ least privilege principles,
meaning no one gets more permissions

95
00:06:08,864 --> 00:06:10,764
than they absolutely require.

96
00:06:11,614 --> 00:06:16,854
This alone can drastically limit
how far an attacker can move

97
00:06:16,884 --> 00:06:18,144
if an account is compromised.

98
00:06:19,064 --> 00:06:23,574
Dynamic access control is the next
evolution where the systems adjust

99
00:06:23,614 --> 00:06:27,634
the privileges in real time, based
upon the factors like unusual

100
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:29,344
location or high volume of requests.

101
00:06:30,054 --> 00:06:34,674
if something seems off, we automatically
lock down key resources or prompt

102
00:06:34,684 --> 00:06:35,884
for additional verifications.

103
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,179
Continuous auditing is also essential.

104
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:43,949
Logs are checked frequently, and
any deviations from the normal

105
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:45,859
usage patterns trigger reviews.

106
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:51,139
This real time feedback loop helps
maintain compliance, and it also gives

107
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,179
us crucial insights into how to refine
roles and permissions over time.

108
00:06:56,679 --> 00:07:00,339
In the cloud native architectures,
APIs tie everything together.

109
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:03,399
They are only the prime
targets for the attackers.

110
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:08,024
That's why our framework emphasizes
rigorously on API security.

111
00:07:08,744 --> 00:07:13,924
We validate requests at multiple points,
checking headers, payloads, security.

112
00:07:14,774 --> 00:07:17,804
we validate requests at
multiple points, right?

113
00:07:18,044 --> 00:07:22,954
we also ensure that each microservice
trusts only specific tokens or

114
00:07:23,154 --> 00:07:26,054
request patterns, reducing the
risk of unauthorized calls.

115
00:07:26,554 --> 00:07:30,764
Machine learning plays a big role in
spotting anomalies at the API layer.

116
00:07:31,344 --> 00:07:35,784
If an endpoint typically receives 100
requests per hour and suddenly spikes

117
00:07:35,784 --> 00:07:41,484
to 10, 000, we want an automated
mechanism to flag or block that.

118
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:47,844
We also integrate threat intelligence
feeds that list known malicious IPs

119
00:07:48,074 --> 00:07:52,794
or suspicious domains, automatically
rejecting calls from bad actors.

120
00:07:53,294 --> 00:07:56,704
By refining API security,
we tackle a huge surface.

121
00:07:57,464 --> 00:07:58,724
attack, surface area for attacks.

122
00:07:59,224 --> 00:08:03,324
This is essentially important when
microservices scale, as you may end

123
00:08:03,324 --> 00:08:07,484
up with hundreds or even, sometimes
thousands of endpoints to protect.

124
00:08:07,984 --> 00:08:11,854
Even with robust authentication,
authorization, and API checks,

125
00:08:12,334 --> 00:08:13,684
threats can still slip through.

126
00:08:14,464 --> 00:08:17,544
That's where advanced analytics come in.

127
00:08:18,184 --> 00:08:21,588
We ingest logs through, from
across the network, combine

128
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:23,414
them with external threats.

129
00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:28,909
threat intelligence and apply AI models
to detect anomalies in real time.

130
00:08:29,299 --> 00:08:35,339
For example, if a zero day vulnerability
surfaces, a system may notice new exploit

131
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:40,079
patterns like specific error codes or
unusual memory usage across containers.

132
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:45,459
Automated responses then isolate
affected containers or force update

133
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:46,959
to mitigate the vulnerability.

134
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:52,379
If a breach does occur, Comprehensive
logging helps with faster

135
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:54,559
containment and root cause analysis.

136
00:08:55,549 --> 00:09:00,159
We quickly see which user accounts
were accessed, which endpoints were

137
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,559
compromised, and which data was touched.

138
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:08,229
This clarity is vital for both legal
compliance and for improving our

139
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:11,219
defenses to prevent a repeat incident.

140
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:15,669
While detection and prevention
are crucial, so is resilience.

141
00:09:16,434 --> 00:09:21,724
Our framework builds redundancy across
regions and providers, aiming for

142
00:09:21,724 --> 00:09:23,594
nearly five nines of availability.

143
00:09:24,094 --> 00:09:28,124
If one region is under heavy
DDoS attack or experiencing a

144
00:09:28,124 --> 00:09:32,644
catastrophic failure, we can failover
automatically to another region.

145
00:09:33,494 --> 00:09:36,014
Resilience also extends to quick recovery.

146
00:09:36,015 --> 00:09:39,014
We define clear runbooks
for incident response.

147
00:09:39,514 --> 00:09:41,614
Who does what, when and how.

148
00:09:42,474 --> 00:09:46,034
Using orchestration tools, we
can revert to the known safe

149
00:09:46,034 --> 00:09:50,524
state within minutes, minimizing
downtime and limiting any damage.

150
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:56,114
Another aspect of resilience is
adaptive security systems that

151
00:09:56,184 --> 00:09:58,164
learn from each new threat pattern.

152
00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:04,249
and update their models, firewall rules,
or access policies in near real time.

153
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:09,369
Over time, this continuous
learning cycle makes the entire

154
00:10:09,469 --> 00:10:11,589
architecture even more stronger.

155
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:15,229
Let's talk about the bottom line.

156
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,849
Data breaches can be
exceedingly expensive.

157
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:24,259
Some estimates put the average
cost of breach in the millions of

158
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:26,729
dollars, factoring in direct losses.

159
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,429
legal fees, regulatory
fines, and the brand damage.

160
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:35,269
By implementing a thorough, layered
security approach, organizations

161
00:10:35,859 --> 00:10:40,759
often see a dramatic, reduction
in their cost, sometimes up to 76

162
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:44,389
percent savings on incident response,
and faster mean time to recovery.

163
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:51,289
Additionally, robust, security often
leads to lower cyber, insurance premiums,

164
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:54,859
as insurers, recognize the reduced risk.

165
00:10:55,674 --> 00:10:59,494
For companies that handle a lot
of sensitive data, these savings

166
00:10:59,494 --> 00:11:00,844
can be substantial over time.

167
00:11:01,634 --> 00:11:07,464
Beyond finances, you're also
safeguarding your reputation.

168
00:11:08,194 --> 00:11:13,454
Maintaining a customer trust is
priceless, and a well publicized breach

169
00:11:13,644 --> 00:11:15,554
can erode that trust very quickly.

170
00:11:16,054 --> 00:11:19,604
To wrap up, we have seen how
a multi layered cloud security

171
00:11:19,604 --> 00:11:23,304
framework can address the growing
challenges in cloud environments.

172
00:11:24,244 --> 00:11:29,974
By combining zero trust principles,
AI driven threat analysis, strong

173
00:11:30,104 --> 00:11:35,134
authentication, and continuous monitoring,
we create a defense that's flexible,

174
00:11:35,464 --> 00:11:37,444
intelligent, and deeply resilient.

175
00:11:38,274 --> 00:11:44,504
Looking forward, we will see advances
in areas like AI driven forensics, micro

176
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:46,824
segmentation for containerized workloads.

177
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:52,544
And adaptive identity management
that evolves with user behavior and

178
00:11:52,584 --> 00:11:55,094
attacker become more sophisticated.

179
00:11:55,684 --> 00:12:00,094
We must remain vigilant and
proactive, continuously refining

180
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:01,714
these layers to stay ahead.

181
00:12:02,464 --> 00:12:02,994
Thank you.
