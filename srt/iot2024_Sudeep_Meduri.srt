00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,780
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,260
Thanks for having me here today.

3
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,330
My name is Sudeep Meduri, and
I'm delighted to present on this

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,479
exciting topic, transforming fintech
using AI, revolutionizing security,

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,459
personalization, and compliance.

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,679
Artificial intelligence is reshaping
how financial services operate today.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,710
Making them smarter,
safer, and more inclusive.

8
00:00:22,409 --> 00:00:26,299
So in this talk, we'll explore
how AI drives innovation in key

9
00:00:26,299 --> 00:00:30,659
areas such as fraud detection,
personalized banking, trading

10
00:00:30,659 --> 00:00:32,960
strategies, and regulatory compliance.

11
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,570
We'll also dive into its potential
to redefine operational efficiencies.

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,670
and customer experiences while addressing
ethical and regulatory challenges.

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,240
So let's get started.

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,079
Fraud detection is one of the
most impactful areas where AI

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,720
has made significant inroads.

16
00:00:49,459 --> 00:00:53,549
Traditional fraud detection methods
used to rely on rules based systems.

17
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:55,859
that were rigid and slow to adapt.

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,980
AI, however, can identify anomalies
within vast amounts of financial

19
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,430
data with unparalleled accuracy.

20
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:05,450
let me point an example here.

21
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:11,059
the JP Morgan's coin system analyzes
over 12, 000 commercial loan

22
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:16,860
agreements in seconds, saving almost
360, 000 hours of manual effort.

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,930
AI also uses Pattern recognition to adopt
new tactics by fraudsters, continually

24
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,920
learning and improving its responses.

25
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,530
These advancements have reduced
false positives by over 60 percent

26
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:36,609
and also helped increase the true
positive detections by almost 50%.

27
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,740
It provides enhanced security by
reducing fraudulent activities.

28
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,330
And ultimately, it helps with
customer confidence, increasing

29
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,350
trust, and encouraging wider adoption
of digital financial services.

30
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:53,530
Another area where AI has played a
significant role, is in personalization.

31
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:58,530
So personalization is at the heart of
modern customer experiences, and AI

32
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,870
is making it possible to personalize
individual user experience at scale.

33
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,980
this is done by analyzing spending
habits, income patterns, and financial

34
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,170
goals, and AI is able to deliver tailored
banking advice to each individual user.

35
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,775
We also now have AI powered robot
advisors, Like wealth front and betterment

36
00:02:19,075 --> 00:02:23,815
who offer customized financial planning
and portfolio management at reduced costs.

37
00:02:24,335 --> 00:02:27,925
these platforms offer customized,
investment strategies, which are

38
00:02:27,925 --> 00:02:31,565
previously accessible only to
high net worth individuals at a

39
00:02:31,565 --> 00:02:33,615
very significantly reduced cost.

40
00:02:34,105 --> 00:02:38,405
Further, ML algorithms create
customized investment portfolios

41
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:42,345
aligned with individual risk
appetites and ESG preferences.

42
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,285
So this not only improves
customer satisfaction.

43
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:50,165
but also deepens loyalty and long term
engagement with financial institutions.

44
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:54,675
Personalization also ensures every
customer feels understood and valued,

45
00:02:55,085 --> 00:02:58,025
which is a very key differentiator
in today's competitive landscape.

46
00:02:58,525 --> 00:03:00,225
let's now look at algorithmic trading.

47
00:03:00,245 --> 00:03:03,515
So this is another area where
AI has shown its transformative

48
00:03:03,545 --> 00:03:08,394
power, in financial trading markets
where even milliseconds matter.

49
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:13,235
AI provides an edge by analyzing
vast amounts of data, including

50
00:03:13,245 --> 00:03:17,895
historical trends, price movements,
trading volumes, and news feeds.

51
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,570
deep learning models enhance trend
forecasting accuracy, helping

52
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,550
traders make informed decisions.

53
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,110
Additionally, AI also optimizes trade
execution by analyzing market liquidity

54
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,900
to minimize costs and, market impact.

55
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,450
firms leveraging AI have,
reported increased profitability

56
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,230
and improved market efficiency.

57
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,870
Making it indispensable in fast
paced trading environments.

58
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,050
For example, firms like Citadel
have heavily invested in AI,

59
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,950
which provided them a competitive
edge over their competitors.

60
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:56,590
Let's now look at the role AI plays in
regulatory compliance, which is an area

61
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,970
which is very ripe for description, given
the complexity and volume of financial

62
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,280
regulations coming up day by day.

63
00:04:04,185 --> 00:04:08,585
AI powered compliance tech solutions can
automate a lot of the data collection,

64
00:04:08,585 --> 00:04:13,115
processing, and analysis tasks,
reducing manual effort and also errors.

65
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:17,325
ML models are able to track
regulatory changes across multiple

66
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:21,575
jurisdictions, interpreting new rules
and assessing their implications.

67
00:04:22,215 --> 00:04:26,825
Predictive analytics adds another layer
by identifying potential compliance

68
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:28,555
risks before they even materialize.

69
00:04:29,215 --> 00:04:33,045
And by streamlining compliance, AI
not only helps reduce costs, but

70
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:37,575
also mitigates reputational risks
associated with non compliance

71
00:04:37,585 --> 00:04:39,375
for these financial institutions.

72
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,735
Operational efficiency is another
critical priority for a lot of

73
00:04:42,745 --> 00:04:47,365
financial institutions and AI has
been delivering on this front as well.

74
00:04:48,065 --> 00:04:52,035
it helps automate routine, financial
tasks, which helps reduce errors

75
00:04:52,045 --> 00:04:54,065
and also reduce processing times.

76
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:59,985
AI chatbots handle customer queries 24
7, significantly reducing response times.

77
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:05,080
Similarly, NLP technologies streamline
back office operations by extracting

78
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,250
key information from unstructured
data in financial documents.

79
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,940
And by automating a lot of these
repetitive tasks, institutions can

80
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,170
now redirect human resources to roles
that truly require creativity and

81
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:22,180
expertise, ultimately reducing costs
while also improving service quality.

82
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,170
AI is also redefining what
customers expect from their

83
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,750
financial service providers.

84
00:05:28,185 --> 00:05:31,525
we now have services such as
voice activated banking, real

85
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:34,935
time financial insights, and
personalized recommendations,

86
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:36,665
which are no longer optional.

87
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:39,305
they are expected now, for
each and every individual user.

88
00:05:39,895 --> 00:05:44,875
For instance, digital assistants like
Bank of America's Erika provide seamless

89
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:48,755
and intuitive interactions guiding
users through complex financial tasks.

90
00:05:49,505 --> 00:05:53,385
AI powered chatbots are also able
to offer round the clock support

91
00:05:53,725 --> 00:05:55,985
and financial guidance for users.

92
00:05:56,485 --> 00:06:00,425
Innovation is central to the
evolution of financial services,

93
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:02,575
and AI is at the forefront.

94
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:08,305
AI powered credit scoring models provide a
more accurate and inclusive assessment of

95
00:06:08,305 --> 00:06:11,625
borrowers, which expands financial access.

96
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:16,835
AI also supports risk assessment and
market analysis by processing and

97
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,175
synthesizing vast amounts of data sets.

98
00:06:19,825 --> 00:06:25,805
RoboAdvisors and AI powered insurance
products some of the other examples of

99
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:30,795
how AI is creating new categories of
financial services, making sophisticated

100
00:06:30,795 --> 00:06:33,335
tools accessible, to a broader audience.

101
00:06:33,835 --> 00:06:39,245
So, while, the benefits of AI in FinTech
are immense, many challenges, still

102
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:43,885
remain, data privacy and security are,
one of the major concerns, especially

103
00:06:43,885 --> 00:06:47,395
with, regulations like, GDPR, et cetera.

104
00:06:48,195 --> 00:06:51,575
Institutions must also implement
robust cybersecurity measures

105
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:55,845
and transparent data practices
to safeguard customer trust.

106
00:06:56,345 --> 00:07:01,135
Another challenge we see is algorithmic
bias, which can lead to unfair outcomes

107
00:07:01,135 --> 00:07:03,975
in credit approvals or loan disbursements.

108
00:07:04,475 --> 00:07:09,505
It's very important to ensure fairness and
that requires diverse training data sets

109
00:07:09,955 --> 00:07:13,235
and regular audits of these AI systems.

110
00:07:13,735 --> 00:07:16,855
Transparency and explainability
of AI models are also equally

111
00:07:16,855 --> 00:07:20,345
critical to maintain user trust
and regulatory compliance.

112
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:24,814
So let's now look at what the
regulatory landscape looks like and

113
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:26,554
the challenges that it can bring.

114
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:32,594
As AI is more adopted in FinTech,
regulators face the daunting task of

115
00:07:32,595 --> 00:07:34,765
keeping pace with AI advancements.

116
00:07:35,435 --> 00:07:39,885
Adaptive regulatory frameworks
that encourage innovation while

117
00:07:40,495 --> 00:07:42,325
mitigating risks are very essential.

118
00:07:42,325 --> 00:07:42,409
for listening.

119
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,990
Algorithmic accountability will also
likely become a regulatory mandate,

120
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,960
requiring institutions to explain
AI decision making process, and data

121
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,210
privacy regulations are also expected
to become stricter than what they

122
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:01,789
are now, focusing on how AI systems
manage personal financial data.

123
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:07,050
There are already data localization
laws in various countries which mandate

124
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,570
that the data that is used doesn't
leave the boundaries of the country.

125
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,780
And these are only going to
become more strict going forward.

126
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,060
And finally, ethical guidelines will
also play a key role in ensuring AI is

127
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,590
used responsibly, balancing technological
progress with societal well being.

128
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:29,490
So I hope this presentation has shed
light on how AI is transforming fintech,

129
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:34,390
addressing some of the challenges, and
paving the way for a more innovative

130
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,420
and inclusive financial ecosystem.

131
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,970
Thanks for having me.

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,090
Thanks everyone for your time.
