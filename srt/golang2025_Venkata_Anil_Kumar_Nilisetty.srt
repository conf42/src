1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,140
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:05,350
Today we are going to discuss on
the, concept called blockchain

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,250
back at the Reconciliation System
for multi enterprise integration.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,250
this presentation shows on the blockchain
concept, and along with that, here

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,090
we are going to use microservices
architecture to implement the

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,530
technical details, and we are going
to apply this in cloud environment.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,640
Let's see.

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,560
dive into the presentation we'll exp here.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,910
We'll explore how this technology
advancement transforms traditional

10
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:36,610
supply chain operations by eliminating
manual reconciliation efforts, enhancing

11
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:41,500
transparency and establishing trust
between trading partners while setting

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,720
the foundation for future enhancements.

13
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,960
What are the basic challenges
in the supply chain environment?

14
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,380
So one is unprecedented complexity.

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,850
Supply chain operations in multinational
enterprises have reached unprecedented

16
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,190
level levels of complexity.

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,650
Global supply chain complexity directly
influences international businesses.

18
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,810
Performance with multinational enterprises
processing an average of 2.3 million

19
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,910
orders transactions annually across
the, across their global networks.

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,630
The other challenging thing is like
critical operational challenges.

21
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,000
Studies revealed that 82% of com
companies experienced the supply

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,740
chain dis disruptions in 2023 due
to data synchronization issues.

23
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:35,789
Other discrepancies require an average
ation time of 48 to 72 hours with

24
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:40,615
23% of cases demanding extensive
manual intervention for resolution.

25
00:01:41,115 --> 00:01:43,340
And the third challenge that we, that.

26
00:01:43,835 --> 00:01:46,565
Facing is substantial financial impact.

27
00:01:46,955 --> 00:01:53,745
Enterprises invest between 4 4 20
K and six 70 K dollars annually

28
00:01:54,245 --> 00:01:55,655
in reconciliation efforts.

29
00:01:56,155 --> 00:02:00,945
The multi multinational enterprises
with higher levels of supply chain

30
00:02:00,945 --> 00:02:07,485
complexity experience a 50 15 to 20%
of increase in co coordination costs.

31
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:12,465
And those with effective
technological solutions see a 24%

32
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,355
improve in market performance.

33
00:02:14,855 --> 00:02:17,855
So these are the challenges
that we usually face during

34
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:18,965
the supply chain environment.

35
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:20,875
And coming to the system architecture.

36
00:02:21,325 --> 00:02:26,715
So here we are going to develop a system
with the base foundation, with the

37
00:02:26,715 --> 00:02:29,535
Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain network.

38
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:35,505
On top of it, we are going to, Build
a framework with Hyperledger Fabric

39
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:39,135
Framework and blockchain network,
microservices and smart contracts.

40
00:02:39,135 --> 00:02:40,185
API GraphQL.

41
00:02:40,545 --> 00:02:45,225
All this, business Logic implementation
comes into the picture after that.

42
00:02:45,315 --> 00:02:49,255
On top of it, we are integrating
APIs, even architecture, standardized

43
00:02:49,255 --> 00:02:50,635
data models, all these things.

44
00:02:50,935 --> 00:02:56,035
Our multi-layered approach leverages
distributed legit technology alongside

45
00:02:56,215 --> 00:02:58,135
modern microservices platforms.

46
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,790
Patterns performance analysis.

47
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,840
Performance analysis demonstrates
throughput capabilities of up to

48
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,790
2,800 transactions per second with
an average latency of 0.5 second

49
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,250
cross organizational networks.

50
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:17,200
The Hyperledger Fabric Network
provides the foundational layer for

51
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,600
immutable transaction core recording
while Micros microservices manage

52
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,640
business logic and a p exposure.

53
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,340
Apart from that, smart contracts
automate order validation

54
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,900
and reconciliation process.

55
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:37,640
While the GraphQL A PA pro provides
flexible data querying capabilities, how

56
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,980
the core components performance will be.

57
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,395
If you see the core components
performance, our system achieves

58
00:03:43,595 --> 00:03:47,235
remarkable performance across
all components where coming

59
00:03:47,255 --> 00:03:49,010
to the Hyperledger Fabric may.

60
00:03:49,545 --> 00:03:55,045
and, framework, it maintains a consistent
blockchain generation time of 0.5

61
00:03:55,045 --> 00:04:00,985
seconds and achieves a validation rate
of 2,200 transactions per second with

62
00:04:00,985 --> 00:04:04,585
99.98 successful transaction date.

63
00:04:04,675 --> 00:04:08,575
The microservices layer effectively
processes 1500 concurrent

64
00:04:08,935 --> 00:04:12,655
logistics events with average
response time of 80 milliseconds.

65
00:04:13,155 --> 00:04:17,565
And coming to the middleware technology
like Apache Kafka reliably handles

66
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:24,315
75,000 events per second with
latencies below 15 milliseconds.

67
00:04:24,585 --> 00:04:28,695
and coming to the smart contracts,
it complete standard Ranch

68
00:04:28,695 --> 00:04:34,605
action in 180 milliseconds with
99.95 successful execution rate.

69
00:04:35,505 --> 00:04:39,855
Whereas the GraphQL a PA,
consistently handles 12,000.

70
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,400
Sorry, 1200 queries per
second with response times

71
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,800
of averaging 95 milliseconds.

72
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,720
If you see the technical implementation
of this, idea, the blockchain

73
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,050
implementation, smart contract logic
and microservices and data of flow

74
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,680
and processing, the Hyperledger
Fabric Network deployment consists

75
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,580
of multiple organization representing
key supply chain participants.

76
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,490
System utilizes a channel based
architecture processing up to 1500

77
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,590
transactions per second while maintaining
data privacy between participants.

78
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,590
Smart contract logic.

79
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:20,749
The smart contracts develop a
chain code in Golan from the

80
00:05:20,749 --> 00:05:22,189
core business logic layer.

81
00:05:22,609 --> 00:05:27,200
Enterprise implementation shows that
well designed smart contracts can

82
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,169
automate up to 85% tough routine.

83
00:05:30,514 --> 00:05:34,834
Business process, reducing
manual intervention by 70%.

84
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:38,924
Microservices architecture
is built on Spring Boot.

85
00:05:39,104 --> 00:05:42,794
The microservices architecture
demonstrates significant advantages

86
00:05:42,794 --> 00:05:44,624
in scalability and maintainability.

87
00:05:45,404 --> 00:05:50,084
Properly containerized services
handle up to thousand transactions

88
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:54,164
per second with response times
of under a hundred milliseconds.

89
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:58,424
And coming to the database and
data processing related where

90
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:02,264
we are using Apache Kafka to
maintain all our transaction,

91
00:06:02,594 --> 00:06:05,714
between the modules and the system.

92
00:06:05,714 --> 00:06:08,954
Implements a comprehensive data
processing pipeline, even driven

93
00:06:08,954 --> 00:06:14,864
architecture, achi archiving, achieving
event processing, latencies under 50

94
00:06:14,864 --> 00:06:17,924
milliseconds for 95% transactions.

95
00:06:18,824 --> 00:06:19,394
This is.

96
00:06:19,894 --> 00:06:23,874
If you see the achievement, it
is very good compared to the

97
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:25,764
old latency approach, right?

98
00:06:26,264 --> 00:06:30,614
And we have a better system
design architecture and good

99
00:06:30,614 --> 00:06:32,474
technical implementation details.

100
00:06:32,774 --> 00:06:38,324
If we have a robust environment
where we can deploy and the

101
00:06:38,324 --> 00:06:39,584
performance achieves more.

102
00:06:39,974 --> 00:06:40,874
That will be great.

103
00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:46,544
So here we are using AWS Cloud
deployment or our deployment platform.

104
00:06:46,934 --> 00:06:51,074
In this, we are using Imagine EKS,
which provides foundational for

105
00:06:51,074 --> 00:06:56,144
container orchestration implementing
through cloud native architecture,

106
00:06:56,444 --> 00:07:02,294
cloud native container deployments,
reduce deployment times by 65% and

107
00:07:02,294 --> 00:07:08,024
improve resource utilization by 45 to
50% compared to traditional methods.

108
00:07:08,524 --> 00:07:13,584
And coming to the database, platform
that we use here in Amgen, we

109
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:17,874
are using Amgen RD service for
implementation of Cloud native best

110
00:07:17,874 --> 00:07:20,184
practices for data persistence.

111
00:07:20,664 --> 00:07:27,504
This is available in multi available
zones so that we can reduce the

112
00:07:27,504 --> 00:07:34,134
burden on the application, and
it achieves 99.99% success rate.

113
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:40,744
Even during peak operations with automated
failover completing within 60 seconds to

114
00:07:40,744 --> 00:07:46,444
reduce more burden on the data, we also
use elastic catching implementation,

115
00:07:46,504 --> 00:07:51,039
which utilizes a distributed catching
architecture that automatically

116
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:56,874
scales based on demand, a cloud
narrative, catching strategies improve.

117
00:07:57,374 --> 00:08:04,304
The response times by 70% while reducing
database load by more than 60%, right?

118
00:08:04,804 --> 00:08:09,514
We have very good deployment and
where we can maintain the software

119
00:08:09,814 --> 00:08:12,034
or the implementation details.

120
00:08:12,814 --> 00:08:15,784
We also need to follow
the security standards.

121
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:19,024
Coming to the security standards
that we are taking care.

122
00:08:19,354 --> 00:08:21,514
That is one is network security.

123
00:08:21,874 --> 00:08:26,104
Here we are using T LS 1.3, which
is a perfect forward secrecy.

124
00:08:26,314 --> 00:08:33,034
The system effectively mitigates 99.9%
man in the middle attempts and can

125
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:38,704
withstand sustained attack volumes up to
300 K malicious transactions per second.

126
00:08:39,454 --> 00:08:44,374
That's a gr great security in
terms of security mechanisms in

127
00:08:44,374 --> 00:08:48,084
the network layer, and coming to
authentication and authorization.

128
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:49,899
Authentication mechanisms.

129
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:54,279
Lever is blockchain native identity
management, combined with the

130
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:56,139
traditional PK infrastructure.

131
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:02,579
By following this, we are reducing
unauthorized access attempts by 99.8%.

132
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:05,489
The system processes access requests.

133
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:09,269
Three, a consensus based
validation mechanism while

134
00:09:09,544 --> 00:09:11,244
ensuring complete auditability.

135
00:09:11,744 --> 00:09:13,064
And also we are.

136
00:09:13,484 --> 00:09:20,914
Implementing multi signature operations
security here, this helps to manage

137
00:09:20,914 --> 00:09:24,844
critical operations implementation
in blockchain native multi signature

138
00:09:24,844 --> 00:09:30,814
protocols that require consensus
from designated validator nodes.

139
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:36,719
It prevents 99.99% of
unauthorized transactions items

140
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:39,029
while maintaining transaction.

141
00:09:39,374 --> 00:09:43,264
Finality times under two
seconds and coming to the

142
00:09:43,264 --> 00:09:45,274
audit and monitoring security.

143
00:09:45,774 --> 00:09:49,584
The audit system creates tamper
proof security logs, supporting

144
00:09:49,584 --> 00:09:51,834
throughput of 50,000 events per second.

145
00:09:52,614 --> 00:09:58,254
Distributed system monitoring incorporates
both network level and application

146
00:09:58,254 --> 00:10:04,424
level security metrics, processing two
terabytes of daily security events.

147
00:10:04,924 --> 00:10:09,864
That is very great in terms of security
for auditing what will be the operational

148
00:10:09,864 --> 00:10:16,344
benefits and the results, so we are
achieving very great operational results.

149
00:10:16,914 --> 00:10:24,094
Verification time reduction up to
89% and tra traceability accuracy to

150
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:28,924
99.6% and manual process elimination.

151
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:34,684
Up to 85% visibility
improvement up to 92%.

152
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:39,454
Implementation analysis demonstrates
significant operational improvements

153
00:10:39,454 --> 00:10:41,674
across multiple dimensions.

154
00:10:42,304 --> 00:10:47,134
System has eliminated approximately
85% of manual documentation process

155
00:10:47,634 --> 00:10:52,074
with automated smart contracts handling
verification and compliance checks,

156
00:10:52,574 --> 00:10:57,009
it has strengthened this relationship
between supply chain participants.

157
00:10:57,554 --> 00:11:00,284
And significantly improve consumer trust.

158
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:05,564
The blockchain solutions reduce
dispute resolution times from an

159
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:11,594
average of 45 days to just five
days while decreasing error rates

160
00:11:11,594 --> 00:11:14,714
in other processing from 5% to 0.1%.

161
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:15,944
That's a great achievement.

162
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:16,844
I can say.

163
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,204
What will be the financial impact?

164
00:11:19,704 --> 00:11:25,159
If you see the financial impact and three
major areas, which is transaction cost

165
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:30,979
reduction, blockchain implementation
reduces a transaction cost up to 65%

166
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:37,129
with the small scale farmers seeing an
average increase in profit margins of 25%

167
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,364
through improved market access, reduced
intermediate co intermediary costs.

168
00:11:43,864 --> 00:11:46,534
And coming to work working
capital improvement.

169
00:11:47,034 --> 00:11:51,114
The processing efficiency has
improved significantly, and the

170
00:11:51,114 --> 00:11:55,494
study shows that the next generation
sub supply chain system reduce

171
00:11:55,494 --> 00:11:57,834
working capital requirements by 30%.

172
00:11:58,334 --> 00:12:01,809
Improved inventory management
and faster payment processing.

173
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,249
That's a very good achievement
in terms of working capital.

174
00:12:07,074 --> 00:12:12,274
And coming to administrative savings
here, the report shows that average

175
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:18,694
annual savings of 0.3 0.2 million
through reduced administrative overhead

176
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,484
and improved operational efficiency.

177
00:12:22,084 --> 00:12:26,079
Immutable audit trials have
proven particularly valuable for

178
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:31,734
regulatory compliance and reducing
compliance verification by 75%.

179
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:39,874
So these are the best implementation
details and financially it is perfect.

180
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:45,529
We are having a very good cloud deployment
environment to make this particular

181
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:51,109
idea to very good maintainable state
by reducing lot of things, right?

182
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:54,489
We can also do feature enhancements.

183
00:12:54,849 --> 00:13:02,774
For this idea by implementing A ML
integration, IOT integration, cross

184
00:13:02,774 --> 00:13:08,384
chain interoperability and enhanced
analytic analytics and mobile development.

185
00:13:08,984 --> 00:13:13,604
By implementing these advanced features
like A-M-L-I-I-O-T integration,

186
00:13:13,874 --> 00:13:19,604
it automates more process and
reducing more, burden on the system.

187
00:13:19,604 --> 00:13:22,364
Inventory cost, inventory management.

188
00:13:22,754 --> 00:13:25,334
In financial things, so
many things we can reduce.

189
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:32,814
It also reduces 95% of manual efforts
at, in a small scale, coming to

190
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:35,284
larger, supply chain industries.

191
00:13:35,334 --> 00:13:39,019
it, it eliminates up to
90% of manual duction.

192
00:13:39,289 --> 00:13:43,579
With that, I'm concluding this,
the transforming supply chain

193
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:47,989
management with the trust and
transparency, operational efficiency.

194
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:53,419
Innovation pathway and scalable
foundation, the blockchain back data

195
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:57,889
reconciliation system demonstrate
transformative potential in resolving,

196
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:02,779
in, in resolving longstanding
challenges with multi enterprise supply

197
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:07,819
chain environments, the integration
distributed technology and modern

198
00:14:07,819 --> 00:14:12,829
cloud native architecture, along with
microservices environment, a robust

199
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:16,909
foundation for secure, efficient,
and automated order management.

200
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:21,999
The demonstrated improvements in
operational efficiency combined with

201
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:27,729
potential for future enhancements
through a ML iot integration Position

202
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:32,949
this solution as cornerstone for next
generation supply chain management.

203
00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:37,739
This successful implementation
showcases how blockchain

204
00:14:37,739 --> 00:14:39,629
technology can vol revolutionize.

205
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:45,469
Business process while providing a
clear pathway for continued innovation.

206
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:52,299
With that, I will end my presentation
here, so hope you like it and you want
