1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,710
Good morning and good afternoon everyone.

2
00:00:05,475 --> 00:00:10,785
I'm truly excited to be here with you
today as part of Con F 42 conference.

3
00:00:11,385 --> 00:00:16,245
My name is Rag and I bring over a
decade of a specialized experience

4
00:00:16,245 --> 00:00:19,995
in data warehousing, business
intelligence, and advanced analytics.

5
00:00:20,565 --> 00:00:24,255
Primarily focused on the banking
and financial services sectors.

6
00:00:24,675 --> 00:00:28,215
Currently working at one of the leading
financial organizations in the industry.

7
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:32,775
I lead AI driven analytics initiatives
that directly support making.

8
00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:37,535
Regulatory complaints and
operational performance enhancement.

9
00:00:37,985 --> 00:00:40,955
My team works at the intersection
of the data science and business

10
00:00:40,955 --> 00:00:45,665
strategy, translating complex
information into actionable insights.

11
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:50,525
Today we are going to explore how
advanced AI techniques, particularly

12
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:56,614
privacy aware approaches like federated
learning and differential privacy are

13
00:00:56,614 --> 00:01:00,275
fundamentally reshaping the predictive
analytics landscape in finance.

14
00:01:00,504 --> 00:01:03,205
This transformation isn't just
about implementing smarter

15
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:05,545
algorithms or faster computing.

16
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:09,625
It's about building systems we
can genuinely trust with our

17
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,485
most sensitive information.

18
00:01:13,164 --> 00:01:14,664
Moving on to the slide number two,

19
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:20,815
AI and ml transforming
financial Predictive analytics.

20
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:26,205
Covering smarter decisions in
risk, fraud, and client strategy.

21
00:01:26,804 --> 00:01:30,854
What used to take weeks of manual
analysis can now happen in real

22
00:01:30,854 --> 00:01:35,414
time, creating opportunities for
more responsive customer experiences.

23
00:01:35,865 --> 00:01:40,965
As models, advance data privacy and
complaints have become non-negotiable

24
00:01:41,384 --> 00:01:47,085
in finance, trust currency and
regulations like GDPR and DPDP are

25
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:48,705
changing how we work with the data.

26
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,750
Customer expectations are also evolving.

27
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,399
People want personalization, but
not at the expense of privacy.

28
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,450
Today's roadmap focuses on
responsible AI that delivers better

29
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,770
predictions alongside governance,
transparency, and business value.

30
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,970
This approach represents a
new co advantage in financial

31
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,769
services, the ability to innovate
without compromising trust.

32
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,740
Moving on to the slide number three.

33
00:02:18,225 --> 00:02:22,965
Analytics in finance has evolved
from basic reporting to predictive

34
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:24,435
and prescriptive models.

35
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:30,075
Now we are entering the era of
responsible AI building systems that

36
00:02:30,075 --> 00:02:36,135
privacy respects meet co complex
demands and deliver powerful insights.

37
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:39,165
Our models can't be
black back boxes anymore.

38
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:43,815
Regulations like GDPR and
India DPDP Act require us to be

39
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:45,645
intentional about data usage.

40
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:49,815
Creating both challenges and
opportunities for financial institutions.

41
00:02:50,355 --> 00:02:53,715
Companies that adapt quickly
gain advantages in both customer

42
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,305
trust and operational efficiency.

43
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:58,455
This evolution isn't just
about technology, right?

44
00:02:58,455 --> 00:03:02,805
It's about fundamentally rethinking
how we derive value from data

45
00:03:02,955 --> 00:03:04,785
while respecting boundaries.

46
00:03:04,995 --> 00:03:09,135
The techniques we will discuss represent
practical solutions to this challenge.

47
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,480
The next slide here talks about this is
where the things get truly exciting from

48
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,220
both technical and business perspective.

49
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,880
Federated learning represents an
advanced form of machine learning,

50
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,080
which fundamentally changes how
we approach model training, right?

51
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,490
Federated learning lets us train models
across multiple data sources without

52
00:03:29,495 --> 00:03:31,345
data living it's original location.

53
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,320
The model travels to the
data, not vice versa.

54
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,130
This means sensitive constrain
customer information stays secure

55
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,630
in its original environment.

56
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,500
When we add differential privacy,
we can protect individual identities

57
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,060
even in aggregator results.

58
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,420
This provides mathematical guarantees
about privacy preservation,

59
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,850
not just procedural safeguards.

60
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,750
Secure multi-party computation
allows different departments

61
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,530
or institutions to collaborate
without revealing underlying data.

62
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,330
This isn't just good data science,
it's responsible engineering

63
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,100
for regulated environments.

64
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:08,090
For example, different banks could
build collaborative fraud detection

65
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:12,290
systems without sharing their actual
customer transactions Together,

66
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:16,460
these techniques form a powerful
toolkit that addresses both technical

67
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,560
and compliance requirements.

68
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,180
Next slide.

69
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,960
In banking, these techniques
enable better credit risk modeling

70
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,840
across global branches and
more effective fraud detection.

71
00:04:27,989 --> 00:04:32,729
While mentioning compliance ability to
learn from diverse data sources without

72
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:37,289
centralizing them, creates models that
are both more accurate and more compliant.

73
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,849
We have seen fraud detection accuracy
improve by double digits, using federated

74
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:46,474
approaches that learn patterns across
multiple different payment channels.

75
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,700
While staying within co complex
boundaries, these improvements

76
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:55,680
directly impact the bottom line
through reduced losses, excuse me,

77
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,070
for a ML and transactional monitoring,

78
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:01,680
excuse me.

79
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:08,160
These approaches reduce false positives
without compromise, compromising

80
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,740
security or customer privacy.

81
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,680
I'm so sorry.

82
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:14,885
This means.

83
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:23,325
Legitimate transactions plot for
review, meaning flag for review,

84
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,955
improving both operational efficiency
and customer experience without

85
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:28,545
sacrificing regulatory complaints.

86
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:32,865
The key insight here is that privacy,
preservation and moral performance

87
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,125
are a necessary trade-offs.

88
00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:36,345
They can be complimentary
with the right approach.

89
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:37,945
Excuse me.

90
00:05:38,845 --> 00:05:40,915
Wealth management
involves deeply personal.

91
00:05:41,245 --> 00:05:45,475
Financial data that reveals not just
assets, but life goals and tolerances.

92
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:51,280
Using federated learning, we can train
models across client segments without

93
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,840
centralizing sensitive information.

94
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,990
This enables personalized
portfolio recommendations while

95
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,640
maintaining strict data separation.

96
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,170
The insights flow to advisors and clients,
but sensitive details stay protected.

97
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:06,040
For example, market segment trends
can inform personalized advice without

98
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,720
exposing individual client portfolios.

99
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,820
These applications aren't theoretical.

100
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,060
They're being implemented today by
forward thinking institutions that

101
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,010
allow wealth managers to provide more.

102
00:06:15,415 --> 00:06:18,595
Consistent advice across
different advisors.

103
00:06:18,655 --> 00:06:22,285
Were preserving the human relationship
that makes wealth management valuable.

104
00:06:23,155 --> 00:06:26,965
The result is enhanced service delivery
that maintains a confidentiality.

105
00:06:27,115 --> 00:06:28,405
Clients expect on regulations.

106
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:30,086
Demand the next slide here.

107
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:34,855
Insurance deals with sensitive, structured
and unstructured data, spanning health

108
00:06:34,855 --> 00:06:38,355
information, property details, and
behavior patterns, predictive pricing

109
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:43,035
and fraud detection benefit from ai,
but only when privacy is preserved.

110
00:06:43,305 --> 00:06:45,705
Our privacy preserving models
have reduced false claim

111
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,895
approvals and optimum optimized.

112
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,160
Premiums while aligning with
regulatory guidelines like solvency.

113
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,120
Two, this dual benefit business
improvement and complaints make these

114
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,590
approaches particularly valuable.

115
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,530
These approaches don't
replace traditional models.

116
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,710
They enhance them by incorporating
diverse data signals without increasing

117
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:07,090
complex risk per stance, we can
now assess risk across placeholders

118
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:11,925
segments without exposing individual
ries, enabling more precise pricing

119
00:07:11,955 --> 00:07:13,600
with appropriate confidentiality.

120
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,850
Insurance represents an excellent
test case for responsible AI because

121
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,000
the business fundamentally depends
on data analysis, yet operates

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,310
under strict privacy constraints.

123
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,050
Next slide.

124
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,070
Deployment presents significant
hurdles, inconsistent data quality,

125
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,180
organizational silos, legacy systems
as strict complex requirements.

126
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,925
Each organization will face its own
unique combination of these challenges.

127
00:07:37,135 --> 00:07:39,405
Addressing these challenges
require combinations.

128
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,840
Between you, to say like combination and
coordination between data scientists.

129
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:47,375
Compliance officers, IT teams,
and business stakeholders.

130
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:50,135
Without this cross-functional
collaboration, even technically, sound

131
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:52,985
solutions may fail to deliver a value.

132
00:07:53,285 --> 00:07:56,465
Successful implementations begin with
clear governance frameworks before

133
00:07:56,465 --> 00:08:00,035
any code is written, establishing
proper guardrails for innovation.

134
00:08:00,275 --> 00:08:03,545
This framework should define roles,
responsibilities, and escalation

135
00:08:03,545 --> 00:08:05,015
path prevent questions arise.

136
00:08:05,315 --> 00:08:07,805
The organization seeing
the most success are those.

137
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,980
That approach, responsible AI as a
business transformation initiative,

138
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,900
not just a technical project.

139
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,365
Next slide here.

140
00:08:16,835 --> 00:08:21,275
Before we talk about a specific AI
toolkit available today, I want to briefly

141
00:08:21,275 --> 00:08:25,295
reference a research paper, which I
co-authored with my colleagues, which was

142
00:08:25,295 --> 00:08:27,395
recently accepted for publication by IEE.

143
00:08:28,295 --> 00:08:31,744
In this work, we developed an
AI driven scheduling framework

144
00:08:31,984 --> 00:08:35,674
that uses long short-term memory
networks to workload prediction

145
00:08:35,734 --> 00:08:37,280
and isolation forest algorithms.

146
00:08:37,714 --> 00:08:41,494
For anomaly detection in cloud ETL
environments, this is particularly

147
00:08:41,494 --> 00:08:44,825
relevant for a big data processing
in banking and financial systems

148
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:48,815
where efficiency directly impacts
both costs and a customer experience.

149
00:08:49,085 --> 00:08:52,385
We extensively tested this framework
across major cloud platforms like

150
00:08:52,385 --> 00:08:57,665
AWS Azure and Google Cloud using real
workload traces and current pricing data.

151
00:08:57,754 --> 00:09:01,865
The results were very compelling,
meaning we achieved up to 40% reduction

152
00:09:01,865 --> 00:09:05,915
in cloud infrastructure cost with
significantly improved responsiveness and.

153
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:10,185
Intelligent auto-scaling behavior
that adapted to changing conditions.

154
00:09:10,514 --> 00:09:14,325
This research matters to our
discussion today because it forms

155
00:09:14,325 --> 00:09:18,165
a foundation for scalable privacy
aware data processing pipelines.

156
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:22,244
In fact, our next research phase is
actively exploring how the same system

157
00:09:22,244 --> 00:09:25,964
can be extended using a federated
learning approaches to support

158
00:09:25,964 --> 00:09:28,785
compliance heavy financial workloads.

159
00:09:29,765 --> 00:09:32,255
So we are not just discussing
theoretical concepts here.

160
00:09:32,435 --> 00:09:36,905
We are building a proven technology
that already working in real enterprise

161
00:09:36,905 --> 00:09:40,474
environments and evolving toward
even stronger privacy protections

162
00:09:40,474 --> 00:09:42,065
and operational efficiency.

163
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:43,835
Next slide.

164
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:44,525
Number 10.

165
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:47,765
The ecosystem around responsible
AI is maturing rapidly.

166
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:51,395
Enterprise Ready Tools Now make
privacy aware AI deployment

167
00:09:51,395 --> 00:09:54,365
feasible in production environments,
not just research labs, right?

168
00:09:54,785 --> 00:09:57,905
Measure cloud providers support
federated learning capabilities paid

169
00:09:57,905 --> 00:10:01,744
with confidential computing environments
for comprehensive data protection.

170
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:05,135
These manage services reduce
the implementation burden while

171
00:10:05,135 --> 00:10:06,935
maintaining strong security guarantees.

172
00:10:07,115 --> 00:10:10,385
Open source differential privacy
libraries from Google IBM and Open

173
00:10:10,385 --> 00:10:14,165
Mind gives teams flexibility in
implementing privacy protections.

174
00:10:14,254 --> 00:10:15,065
These tools have.

175
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:19,065
Active communications and regular
updates make them wearable

176
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:20,505
options for protection use.

177
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:23,595
What used to be r and d concepts
are now deployment already.

178
00:10:23,595 --> 00:10:27,225
Techniques with enterprise support and
growing communities of practice, this

179
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:31,125
maturity means financial institutions
can implement these approaches with

180
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,015
confidence in their sustainability.

181
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,405
Next slide.

182
00:10:35,944 --> 00:10:37,204
You're wondering where to begin.

183
00:10:37,415 --> 00:10:39,155
Start small, but think strategically.

184
00:10:39,575 --> 00:10:41,974
Pilot a federated use case
where privacy matters.

185
00:10:42,155 --> 00:10:44,765
Fraud detection is an excellent
candidate given its sensitivity

186
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:45,785
and high business impact.

187
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,655
Build a cross-functional team spanning
analytics, legal and IT capabilities.

188
00:10:49,925 --> 00:10:52,355
This diverse key of prospective helps.

189
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:56,464
Navigate technical, regulatory,
and operational complexities

190
00:10:56,464 --> 00:10:57,185
from the beginning.

191
00:10:57,635 --> 00:11:01,774
Define success metrics upfront, not just
model accuracy, but regulatory alignment,

192
00:11:01,774 --> 00:11:03,214
risk reduction, and business value.

193
00:11:03,545 --> 00:11:06,545
These broader metrics help demonstrate
the full impact of responsible AI

194
00:11:06,545 --> 00:11:10,145
approaches culture, establishing a
center of excellence that can document

195
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:12,004
learnings and establish best practices.

196
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,974
Remember, it's about building
a momentum responsibly, not

197
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,685
achieving perfection immediately.

198
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,865
Each successful implementation
creates institutional knowledge

199
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:21,395
that makes the next one easier.

200
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,490
Next slide here to wrap
this conversation up.

201
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:30,140
The future of AI in finance is
exciting because it'll demand trust

202
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,060
and transparency like never before.

203
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,230
Explainability, secure collaborations,
real time competence checks.

204
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,970
These are not nice to haves anymore.

205
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,410
They're becoming requirements.

206
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:44,540
And my last slide for today, if
you take one thing away today

207
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:46,280
from this topic, it's this.

208
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,105
Privacy is just a roadblock to ai.

209
00:11:49,135 --> 00:11:52,069
It's a foundation for its
success in financial services.

210
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,349
Thank you so much for your attention.

211
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,589
Feel free to contact me over
LinkedIn and thanks again for

212
00:11:57,589 --> 00:11:59,540
giving me this opportunity, conf 42.

213
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,050
Thank you.

214
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:00,589
Bye now.
