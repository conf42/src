00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,929
Hello people.

2
00:00:02,059 --> 00:00:05,660
Welcome to my presentation today
I wanna talk about virtualized

3
00:00:06,709 --> 00:00:09,020
GPU for AI in enterprise storage.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,460
To optimize to provide a
cost optimized solution.

5
00:00:13,069 --> 00:00:16,915
With the evolution of artificial
intelligence there has been

6
00:00:16,965 --> 00:00:21,945
increasing demand for powerful
GPUs to support the AI workloads.

7
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:26,070
The organizations currently face a
significant challenges related to

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,005
the infrastructure costs, operational
complexity and deployment efficiency.

9
00:00:31,454 --> 00:00:35,925
In this presentation I'm gonna
talk about how Dell Technologies.

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,775
VMware and Nvidia have collaborated
to develop a virtualized GPU solution,

11
00:00:41,955 --> 00:00:46,845
specifically designed for enterprise
storage environments and creating a more

12
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:51,585
flexible and cost effective solution
approach towards AI implementation.

13
00:00:53,145 --> 00:00:57,754
Now let's talk about the GPU market
and its performance potential.

14
00:00:58,054 --> 00:01:04,144
So the present GPU market holds up to
11.8 billion market share when this

15
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:08,185
projected to grow up to 29% by 2030.

16
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:13,244
A study show how, virtualized GPUs
exhibit an average overhead off

17
00:01:13,244 --> 00:01:17,024
about 18% across various workloads.

18
00:01:17,205 --> 00:01:22,804
But benefits of this implementation
like resource utilization, market

19
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:27,394
flex management, flexibility and
cost optimization, which will offset

20
00:01:27,394 --> 00:01:29,464
these performance considerations.

21
00:01:31,504 --> 00:01:36,434
The collaborative approach of industry's
leading tech companies like Dell, VMware.

22
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:42,329
And Nvidia is gonna solve upcoming
compute challenges for AI implementations.

23
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:47,189
This strategic alliance has produced
an exceptional outcomes demonstrating

24
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:52,989
near linear performance scaling from
one to eight GPUs within a single server

25
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:55,449
for deep learning training workloads.

26
00:01:55,629 --> 00:02:00,249
Independent research conforms
that the state of art virtual GPU

27
00:02:00,249 --> 00:02:02,709
implementations consistently deliver.

28
00:02:03,054 --> 00:02:08,274
Up to 94% of native bare metal
performance across diverse

29
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:10,104
artificial intelligence workloads.

30
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,349
Here is the comparison of the
performance metrics with like

31
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:19,319
virtual GPUs versus bare metal GPUs.

32
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:23,409
The metrics clearly
states the virtual GPU.

33
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:28,399
Performance meets almost 92% of
the efficiency as traditional

34
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:30,689
bare metal configuration.

35
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:34,269
Achieving the most, a achieving
a significant portion of what

36
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:39,739
traditional traditional virtual,
bare metal GPUs has been producing.

37
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:46,599
Here are the key components of the
solutions, the enterprise ready validated

38
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:52,399
architecture integrates NVIDIA's AI
Enterprise Software Suite, empowering

39
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:55,039
the organizations, leveraging VMware.

40
00:02:55,089 --> 00:02:59,079
We spear to efficiently virtualize
and containerize mission critical

41
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:01,179
artificial intelligence workloads.

42
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:05,859
Comprehensive performance testing that
has been done has shown an exceptional

43
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:12,309
results with deep learning training
workloads achieving up to 96% of what

44
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:14,999
traditional bare metal GPU performs.

45
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:18,569
So interference workloads
almost demonstrate.

46
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:24,309
Even more impressive resulting results
reaching to up to 98% of what a

47
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:27,409
traditional GPU has been giving to us.

48
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:33,339
So in the, if you look at the various
components of the, this solution

49
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:38,379
that has been designed, there is a
virtualized deployment layer where it

50
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:41,109
offers a flexible implementation across.

51
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:47,259
OnPrem on-premises infrastructure or if
it's a cloud service provider, we can

52
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:50,139
always containerize the applications.

53
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:53,599
Accelerate and simplified
AI workload deployments with

54
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,699
optimized resource utilization.

55
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:03,099
And the Nvidia AI enterprise software
suite offers optimized software

56
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:05,139
for virtualized AI workflows.

57
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:11,079
Let's compare how a virtualized GPU
has been performing when compared to

58
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:14,839
bare metal GPU in different use cases.

59
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:22,719
So when it comes to deep learning training
for ai, 96% of the bare metal performance

60
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,070
in the virtualized environments has
been achieved with minimal which

61
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,840
is like a minimal performance.

62
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,080
Reduction when you compare that off
with traditional bare metal performance

63
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,680
in the interference workloads
the study shows we have achieved.

64
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:43,229
The GPUs have virtualized, GPUs has
achieved 90 per 98% of the performance.

65
00:04:43,989 --> 00:04:48,200
Compared to that of our traditional
traditional GPUs in the tensor

66
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,070
flow image classification it
was quite a significant mark.

67
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,599
It has achieved 95% of
performance retention processing

68
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:00,469
up to 4,500 images per second.

69
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:07,075
In the general AI workloads
you see a remarkable of 96% of

70
00:05:07,075 --> 00:05:11,125
performance efficiency across
standard enterprise AI applications.

71
00:05:11,515 --> 00:05:17,455
When it comes to the memory intensive
workloads, 92 per approximately 92%

72
00:05:17,455 --> 00:05:22,115
of the performance retention has
been achieved, which shows like, only

73
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:24,755
four to 5% of the decrease the come.

74
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,940
Decreased performance compared
to non-virtualized environments.

75
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:30,470
Let's see.

76
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:35,690
What are the operational benefits
of, implementing virtualized GPUs.

77
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:40,540
So you see a significant
reduced deployment time.

78
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,670
So infrastructures provisioning
tasks, infrastructure provisioning

79
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,640
tasks usually used to take weeks.

80
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:52,680
That can be overcome within even,
I mean in days or even hours.

81
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,920
Reducing up to 60% of deployment time for.

82
00:05:57,175 --> 00:06:01,735
All the AI workloads, you see a
remarkable, improved operational

83
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:06,765
efficiency with organizations
leveraging the VMware expertise for

84
00:06:07,185 --> 00:06:11,525
AI deployments achieved that, that
has, they have achieved like 83%.

85
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:17,720
Or greater operational efficiency and
required 30% less specialized training

86
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,890
I mean to, for their employees.

87
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:24,604
Those implementing a dedicated AI
infrastructure, you see an enhanced a

88
00:06:24,604 --> 00:06:30,220
resource utilization when compared to
physical GPUs traditional bare metal GPUs.

89
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,950
So organizations implementing these
virtual GPU solutions achieved

90
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,690
approximately three times better
resource utilization than dedicated AI

91
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:44,520
infrastructure and reduced maintenance
overhead by approximately 54%.

92
00:06:44,985 --> 00:06:50,480
And also about all these the total
cost of ownership is very much low.

93
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,360
The unified approach developed by all
these three tech giants reduced an

94
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,590
overall IT operational expenses by 33%
and lowers the total cost of ownership by

95
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,310
approximately 40% over a five year period.

96
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:16,935
Let's see how organization improve
their operations from going to by

97
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:22,195
implementing virtualized GPU solutions
around the workload deployment time.

98
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:27,845
The AI workload deployment time
reduces up to 60% of their timelines.

99
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:32,780
Transforming like week long
projects into days or even hours.

100
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:38,530
The operational you see a significant
operational efficiency where 83%

101
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:43,770
greater operational efficiency for the
organizations leveraging existing VMware

102
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,960
expertise, specialized in training.

103
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,950
You don't have to.

104
00:07:47,195 --> 00:07:52,475
You don't have to plan on like training
your employees for a specialized training

105
00:07:52,815 --> 00:07:59,235
which reduces like up to 30% of your
time, resources cost in, in training

106
00:07:59,235 --> 00:08:03,805
your employees compared to implementing
a dedicated AI infrastructure.

107
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:09,545
Resource utilization has been
improvised up to three, three times

108
00:08:09,545 --> 00:08:13,095
better when compared by implementing
the virtualized solutions.

109
00:08:13,315 --> 00:08:17,095
Maximizing, maximizing the
company's rate of investment on

110
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:19,015
returns, maintenance overhead.

111
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:24,570
You reduce about 54% of 54% of
reduction in ongoing maintenance

112
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,890
requirements compared to traditional
siloed AI infrastructure.

113
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:35,820
Here are some of the platforms where
AI has integrated where AI has been

114
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:42,130
integrated and, let's discuss about
how the AI has virtual GPUs has

115
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:46,460
helped with the AI integration on
these platforms coming to the human

applications process these applications

122
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,830
being are able to process an average of
6,000 resumes per day while requiring

123
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:26,470
only 52 with only 50 to 20% of the
computational resources needed in.

124
00:09:26,935 --> 00:09:28,555
Non-virtualized environments.

125
00:09:28,795 --> 00:09:33,545
So organizations implementing these
solutions through virtualized GPU

126
00:09:33,545 --> 00:09:41,695
infrastructure, reported achieving a full
deployment time of 42% more on efficient

In enterprise AI infrastructure addressing
both technological and operational

179
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:37,970
challenges that have traditionally
impeded widespread AI integration a

180
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,370
significant comparable performance.

181
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,690
So the performance
analysis confirm analysis.

182
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:48,580
The performance analysis confirmed
that virtualized GPUs on virtualized

183
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,510
GPU environments deliver results
comparable to bare metal implementations.

184
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,990
For most AI workloads while
offering substantial operational

185
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:02,550
and financial benefits, including
faster deployment and improved

186
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,910
resource utilizations the enterprise
wide implementation, the solutions.

187
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,360
Support for these G solutions.

188
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,840

diverse AI requirements across enterprise

189
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:20,670
departments enables organizations to
implement comprehensive AI strategies

190
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,170
without creating infrastructure,
silos, or operational complexities.

191
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:30,750
It has finally, the end resulted
end result is acceleration

192
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,580
in AI transformation.
