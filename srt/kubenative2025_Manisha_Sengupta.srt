1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,370
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,950
I hope you are enjoying
the conference so far.

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,020
Let me introduce myself.

4
00:00:06,739 --> 00:00:11,270
I am Manisha San Gupta and I have
spent around 18 years in the world

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:16,310
of technology, of which more than a
decade, I work at the intersection of

6
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:21,560
finance and technology modernization,
helping organizations mostly modernize

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,035
their systems while still keeping
trust and risk as their top priority.

8
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:31,605
Today I'll be covering my topic,
securing AI driven finance.

9
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:34,925
Before I start, lemme ask a question.

10
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:37,655
Have you ever heard about this?

11
00:00:38,345 --> 00:00:43,820
A popular smartphone smart home app
that use of AI in the cloud to detect

12
00:00:43,849 --> 00:00:48,959
unusual activities like, notifying you
if someone enters your house, such as.

13
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:54,869
To make the system scalable, the
AI model runs on a cloud platform

14
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,629
and communicates over public APIs.

15
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:04,139
One day, a user unknowingly exposes their
API key by syncing with a third party app.

16
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:06,329
And guess what?

17
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:11,520
A hacker discovers it and starts
sending queries to this a IP learning

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,439
patterns about how the home is empty,
how and when the home is empty.

19
00:01:16,679 --> 00:01:17,939
Now what happens, et cetera.

20
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:24,649
Suddenly this very technology that's
meant to protect the user becomes a tool

21
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:30,549
for inclusion, all because cloud native
AI wasn't secure enough end to end.

22
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,114
Now, when I thought about this, it hit me.

23
00:01:33,614 --> 00:01:35,954
The real threat isn't
always the big obvious hack.

24
00:01:36,614 --> 00:01:39,104
It's the quiet patterns
that we often overlook.

25
00:01:39,604 --> 00:01:45,004
As financial institutions, we experienced
world revolution in modern world,

26
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:50,314
while AI systems now power fraud,
detections, credit scoring, trading,

27
00:01:50,699 --> 00:01:51,779
customer engagement, et cetera.

28
00:01:52,624 --> 00:01:56,554
At the same time, cloud native
architectures like containers

29
00:01:56,584 --> 00:02:00,064
and microservices are replacing
our traditional systems.

30
00:02:00,564 --> 00:02:07,584
This creates opportunities, no
doubt, but also raises risks like

31
00:02:07,584 --> 00:02:13,194
financial losses, reputational damage,
regulational penalties and whatnot.

32
00:02:13,694 --> 00:02:17,534
Evolution of AI in finance
has come a long way.

33
00:02:18,034 --> 00:02:22,444
Detections sophisticated machine
learning models now analyzing

34
00:02:22,444 --> 00:02:24,604
millions of transactions per second.

35
00:02:25,564 --> 00:02:32,214
Enhanced capabilities learning are
powering personal services in rapid

36
00:02:32,844 --> 00:02:35,574
speed and functionality out basis.

37
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:36,384
Guess what?

38
00:02:36,594 --> 00:02:37,254
Security.

39
00:02:37,754 --> 00:02:41,534
And then that leaves us with blind spots.

40
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:48,094
Cloud native technologies such as
Kubernetes, microservices, even driven

41
00:02:48,094 --> 00:02:54,034
architectures, and say, serverless
computing allow numerous flexibility,

42
00:02:54,214 --> 00:03:00,004
no doubt, and scalability, starting
with flexible deployment, loosely

43
00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:05,019
coupled development options near
real time processing and et cetera.

44
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,959
But at the same time, they also create
risk limiting visibility into model

45
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:18,469
behavior, poor testing of advers
scenarios, weak governance in place, and

46
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:22,399
too often a focus on speed over security.

47
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:25,844
These threats are clear
and growing every day.

48
00:03:26,344 --> 00:03:31,984
Advers attacks that treat can
models into making bad decisions.

49
00:03:32,554 --> 00:03:36,784
In fact, one of the most dangerous
threats come from adversial attacks.

50
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:41,824
This involves carefully crafted
inputs designed to fool the AI model

51
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:46,594
into making mistakes while still
looking very legitimate to human.

52
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:51,204
Imagine a fraud detection system where
an attacker could craft transactions

53
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:53,634
like the AI believes are safe.

54
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:59,369
While in reality, they are frauded
and as methods evolve, attackers don't

55
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:01,229
even need insider knowledge anymore.

56
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:07,609
Black attacks, black box attacks now can
succeed even with limited information.

57
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:08,949
Data poisoning.

58
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,219
That corrupt training data
sets is another problem.

59
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,764
Subtle but devastating.

60
00:04:13,864 --> 00:04:18,059
Attack is data poisoning during
training, attackers sleep,

61
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:19,860
malicious data into data sets.

62
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,580
The learning process
itself from the starting.

63
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:28,159
For instance, a poisoning credit score
model might unfairly discriminate

64
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,330
against a certain group of people
while still looking very effective.

65
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:36,890
Overall, such attacks can persist
unnoticed for really long period

66
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,965
of time, quietly undermining
both fairness and compliance.

67
00:04:41,465 --> 00:04:45,844
Model extraction or inversion
that steals algorithms and

68
00:04:45,895 --> 00:04:47,875
sensitive data is also increasing.

69
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:53,685
Attackers can reverse engineer the
AI models by analyzing the outputs.

70
00:04:54,185 --> 00:04:54,875
What do they do?

71
00:04:55,055 --> 00:04:58,745
They extract the sensitive data such
as customer spending habits, our

72
00:04:58,745 --> 00:05:00,635
prietary trading strategies, et cetera.

73
00:05:01,445 --> 00:05:03,665
This is more than a breach of security.

74
00:05:04,475 --> 00:05:07,925
I say this is a breach
of privacy and trust.

75
00:05:08,425 --> 00:05:12,745
And with AI models increasingly
offered via APIs, the attack

76
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,905
surface expands dramatically.

77
00:05:15,405 --> 00:05:20,895
Let's not forget cloud vulnerabilities
itself, like container escapes

78
00:05:20,895 --> 00:05:22,705
or configurations, et cetera.

79
00:05:23,205 --> 00:05:26,055
Kubernetes has become the
backbone of cloud native

80
00:05:26,055 --> 00:05:29,295
finance, but it's complex and.

81
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,695
Complexity invites risk.

82
00:05:32,195 --> 00:05:35,705
These configured, role-based
access control can give

83
00:05:35,705 --> 00:05:37,295
attackers access privileges.

84
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:42,925
Container images from public repositories
may already include vulnerabilities in it.

85
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:47,745
Weak network policies can allow
lateral movement between containers.

86
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:52,474
When everything is interconnected,
one small misstep can open

87
00:05:52,474 --> 00:05:54,700
the entire cluster to attack.

88
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,000
Containers, Kubernetes and ephemeral
infrastructures definitely bring

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,780
flexibility to us, but also brings
complexity overly permissive, access

90
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:11,609
misconfigured roles, and the difficulty
of monitoring short-lived containers

91
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,270
makes it very hard to secure AI workloads.

92
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:16,455
This means.

93
00:06:16,955 --> 00:06:21,245
Auditability and rapid
response are major challenges.

94
00:06:21,745 --> 00:06:24,470
Here is a real world fraud
detection attack scenario.

95
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:30,580
Imagine this attackers compromise
a developer's account exploits

96
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:35,500
weak network policies, corrupt
transaction data, pipelines and

97
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,690
launchers, real transactions that can
successfully bypass fraud deductions.

98
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:45,940
All this could happen without
raising any alarm if security isn't

99
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,710
embedded throughout the system.

100
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:54,120
Or take trading systems, adversarial
study algorithm outputs so they

101
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,930
can reverse engineer the logic and
manipulate the market in front.

102
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,290
Run the institutions own trades.

103
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,210
In distributed cloud native
systems, such manipulations can

104
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:10,920
very well look like normal activity,
making detections even harder

105
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,340
where comes the human factor?

106
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,420
Yeah.

107
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,660
Humans are another important
factor in this equation.

108
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,900
Technology isn't the only risk.

109
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,120
Human factors play a major role.

110
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,290
Data scientists focus on
accuracy, not security.

111
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:31,140
Common oversight can happen like
using unvalidated public data sets,

112
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,020
insufficient data sanitization, et cetera.

113
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:41,240
Developers may even overlook secure
practices in shared environments, overly

114
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,790
broad permissions, vulnerabilities
in open source libraries, et

115
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,160
cetera, can come into the picture.

116
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,080
DevOps.

117
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,385
May cut corners under pressure.

118
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:53,665
Performance over security.

119
00:07:54,415 --> 00:07:58,555
Rapid development testing cycle
can lead to cutting these corners.

120
00:07:59,055 --> 00:08:02,595
Lastly, critical skill gap is present.

121
00:08:03,465 --> 00:08:07,635
There is a global shortage right
now of professionals who are skilled

122
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:10,125
both in AI and cybersecurity.

123
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:10,685
Do.

124
00:08:11,185 --> 00:08:12,865
How do we build resilience?

125
00:08:12,865 --> 00:08:16,815
In this case, four pillars
that we have to abide by.

126
00:08:17,445 --> 00:08:17,835
Zero.

127
00:08:17,835 --> 00:08:18,345
Trust.

128
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:19,545
Yes.

129
00:08:19,635 --> 00:08:19,995
Zero.

130
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:22,635
Trust across all AI pipeline is essential.

131
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:28,445
Strong model governance with versioning
and security checks must be in place.

132
00:08:28,945 --> 00:08:34,855
Robust data security can ensure
integrity, privacy, and lineage tracking.

133
00:08:35,355 --> 00:08:39,995
Infrastructure security in place
with defense indepth principles

134
00:08:40,955 --> 00:08:42,755
tailored for AI can help.

135
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:47,335
In short, we need to establish
multilayer defense system.

136
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:50,215
No single security measure is enough.

137
00:08:50,485 --> 00:08:54,585
We need defense in depth,
application security, data

138
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:58,155
security, AI specific controls,
infrastructure, security, everything.

139
00:08:58,655 --> 00:09:03,575
By layering defenses, we can protect
our AI driven finance evolution.

140
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:08,185
As AI takes a center role in
security, it's not enough for

141
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:09,445
our models to be accurate.

142
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,545
They must also be explainable.

143
00:09:12,505 --> 00:09:19,015
Implementing explainable AI or AI
allows us to understand why a system

144
00:09:19,555 --> 00:09:22,080
flags a thread, helping build trust.

145
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:26,245
Speed up investigations
and reduce false positives.

146
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:33,555
Insecurity, clarity isn't just a feature,
it's the necessity in that front.

147
00:09:33,645 --> 00:09:36,015
Xai is a powerful ally for us.

148
00:09:36,795 --> 00:09:41,655
It also helps us detect anomalous,
expose hidden biases, and meet

149
00:09:41,925 --> 00:09:43,515
any regulatory requirements.

150
00:09:44,475 --> 00:09:47,744
However, we need to be very
careful with that as well.

151
00:09:48,244 --> 00:09:52,264
As it must be implemented
cautiously balancing, transparency,

152
00:09:52,654 --> 00:09:54,154
performance, and security.

153
00:09:54,654 --> 00:09:59,394
We need to think about multi-layered
defense for anomaly detection as well.

154
00:09:59,894 --> 00:10:05,414
Security must work across
layers, infrastructure, model,

155
00:10:05,414 --> 00:10:07,034
behavior, and data layers.

156
00:10:07,994 --> 00:10:11,295
By correlating anomalies,
say network spikes.

157
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:16,454
With model drifts and data shifts,
we can distinguish benign glitches

158
00:10:16,604 --> 00:10:18,614
from genuine coordinated attacks

159
00:10:19,114 --> 00:10:24,954
Beyond technology, governance is must,
risk management should be in place

160
00:10:25,194 --> 00:10:27,024
for both technology and business risk.

161
00:10:27,524 --> 00:10:32,204
Define clear accountability and
ownership for development, deployment,

162
00:10:32,204 --> 00:10:33,734
monitoring, maintenance cycles.

163
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:39,934
Continuous audit and compliance should
be in place to safeguard, include

164
00:10:39,934 --> 00:10:45,219
specific provisions for AI related
security events, ethical safeguards,

165
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:51,004
ethical safeguard procedures should be
established as well, like bias testing.

166
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:53,269
And fairness, evolutions, et cetera.

167
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:58,909
These frameworks keep institutions
secure, compliant, and trusted

168
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:04,899
To move forward, organizations must
assess current systems and their risks.

169
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:10,509
Prioritize critical systems, high
income, high impact vulnerabilities.

170
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,289
Choose technologies that are
compatible with cloud native needs.

171
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:20,489
Important human factor, develop
skills and possibly create new teams

172
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:23,429
focused on AI and security together.

173
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:27,829
And also we must prepare for
future challenges such as quantum
