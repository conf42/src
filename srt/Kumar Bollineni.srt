1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:00,720
Hey.

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,350
Hi everyone.

3
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,370
Good morning, good evening.

4
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,370
My name is Kumar.

5
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:09,360
I'm having 12 years of experience in
S-A-P-E-R-P solutions In this conference

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,529
we will discuss how generative VA is
revolutionizing business intelligence.

7
00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:16,035
In cloud ERP ecosystems.

8
00:00:16,785 --> 00:00:21,075
In this presentation we will mainly focus
on how generative artificial intelligence

9
00:00:21,085 --> 00:00:26,095
can evolutionize predictive analytics
capabilities within ERP cloud systems.

10
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:29,475
We'll examine how advanced machine
learning models, particularly

11
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:34,365
generative adverse networks, integrate
with existing ERP infrastructures

12
00:00:34,365 --> 00:00:38,595
to transform forecasting accuracy
across multiple business functions.

13
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:42,335
And through the technical foundations
and implementation strategies and

14
00:00:42,545 --> 00:00:47,175
cross industry case studies, we will
demonstrate the tangible business value.

15
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:51,555
While addressing critical challenges
in data quality, system architecture,

16
00:00:51,824 --> 00:00:55,309
and model maintenance you will
gain a strategic roadmap for

17
00:00:55,309 --> 00:00:59,824
leveraging generative AI to achieve
competitive advantage and through

18
00:00:59,824 --> 00:01:04,234
enhanced operational efficiency
and data driven decision making.

19
00:01:04,235 --> 00:01:08,395
So as an example, like Simon
users generative VA in its team

20
00:01:08,395 --> 00:01:12,475
center, ERP system to simulate
supply chain disruptions and

21
00:01:12,475 --> 00:01:14,515
generative optimal recovery plans.

22
00:01:14,565 --> 00:01:18,815
Improving resilience, so the next
one, what we are looking at is

23
00:01:18,815 --> 00:01:21,005
evaluation and market trends.

24
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:24,650
So we are we are differentiating the
market trends by three different ones.

25
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,010
So unprecedented growth.

26
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,780
So the global AI in ERP market
is expecting rapid expansion with

27
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,280
projections indicating a compound
annual growth rate of for 29.7%.

28
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:39,105
Through the 2013, so the Microsoft
Dynamics 365 as an example

29
00:01:39,355 --> 00:01:43,495
365, dynamics 365 a integrates
with ERP system contributing a

30
00:01:43,495 --> 00:01:47,065
projected by 30% CS year by 2030.

31
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,400
So widespread adoption, the second
market trend these widespread adoption,

32
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:58,450
approximately 65% of large enterprises
now incorporated some of some form of EA

33
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,490
capability within their ER ecosystems.

34
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,490
A significant increase from
previous implementation rates.

35
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,840
A, as an example, Walmart uses a
ERP for inventory management and

36
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,780
reducing the stockouts by 30%.

37
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,770
And the next one, what we are
looking at is industry leaders.

38
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,940
So the accelerated adoption is
particularly evident in manufacturing,

39
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,040
retail and health healthcare sector.

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,480
So where complex operational
requirements that create a compelling

41
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,520
use cases for predictive capabilities.

42
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,460
So as an example, like Johnson
employs EA in S-A-P-E-R-P to optimize

43
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,100
pharmaceutical production schedules.

44
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,820
So the next one, what we are looking at
is the next one we discuss about, the next

45
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,690
section, what we will discuss about is
technical capabilities and business value.

46
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,730
So here we have three
different capabilities here.

47
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,200
The first one is enhance decision making,
organization implementing AI enhance.

48
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,800
DRP systems reports some substantial
improvements in decision making

49
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,750
process with 78% of early adopters
documenting enhanced operational

50
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,200
outcomes through more accurate
forecasting and predictive maintenance.

51
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,990
As an example, Coca-Cola uses here
and S-A-P-E-R-P to forecast regional

52
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,120
demand and reduced waste by 20%.

53
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,780
The next one is efficiency improvements.

54
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,490
So company's reports an average reduction
of 35% in manual data processing

55
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,800
requirements on following successful
deployment creating compelling financial

56
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,720
justification for implementation.

57
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,580
As an example Unilever automated
invoice processing in its ERP cutting

58
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,520
work cutting manual work by 40%.

59
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,150
And so the next one is deployment models.

60
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,560
So cloud-based implementation has
become a dominant paradigm offering the

61
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,685
scalability and computational resources
necessary for advanced remodeling.

62
00:03:45,295 --> 00:03:46,795
Training and interference.

63
00:03:47,275 --> 00:03:51,475
So Netflix leverages S-A-P-E-R-P
Cloud with AI for real time

64
00:03:51,475 --> 00:03:53,455
content licensing, cost analysis.

65
00:03:53,505 --> 00:03:57,690
Through that they are reducing a lot of
cost which is getting which is getting

66
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,700
implemented as part of the cost analysis.

67
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,170
Okay, the next one, what we are
looking at is architectural framework

68
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,570
for AI and AI and ERP integration.

69
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,770
So here we have a different layers
approach, a file layer approach where

70
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,170
we can integrate AI and ERP together.

71
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,515
So the first one is se security
layer where we will ensure data

72
00:04:17,515 --> 00:04:21,065
production, and compliance when we
are integrating, with AI to ERP.

73
00:04:21,065 --> 00:04:25,345
And the next one is a technology layer
where we provide the computing inter

74
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:31,165
infrastructure which enables which enables
the integration of AI and ERP and the next

75
00:04:31,165 --> 00:04:35,725
one where we manages the information flow
and the storage of data using data layer.

76
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:39,505
And the next one, how we handle
the business logic and processing

77
00:04:39,715 --> 00:04:41,030
using the application layer.

78
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,125
And the last one is a presentation
layer where the user interface

79
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,325
and experience is, delivered.

80
00:04:47,865 --> 00:04:51,645
So through, through these five layer
approach, successful implementation

81
00:04:51,645 --> 00:04:53,395
follow this structured approach.

82
00:04:53,455 --> 00:04:57,175
Incorporating five key architecture
layers of this framework enables

83
00:04:57,225 --> 00:05:01,815
organizations to maintain, clarity
regarding system boundaries integration

84
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:06,135
points and information flows while
implementing advanced AI capabilities.

85
00:05:06,135 --> 00:05:10,435
As part of this security layer
as an example, Pfizer ERP uses a

86
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,765
blockchain for HIPA compliant data
encryption in clinical trials.

87
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:18,185
That is one of the, one of the
biggest layer where everyone needs

88
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,135
to ensure everything is secured.

89
00:05:20,135 --> 00:05:25,290
The data compliance data protection
is one of the major major drive, data

90
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,890
driven point when we are integrating
with the A with ERP systems.

91
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:34,770
So next one, what we are looking at is a
cloud infrastructure on data management.

92
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,420
How we, how the infrastructure.

93
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,990
Infrastructure, so the next one,
what we are looking at is a cloud

94
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,940
infrastructure on data management.

95
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,045
So in this section we will
discuss how the infrastructure and

96
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,280
data management can be handled.

97
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,720
What are the benefits of cloud?

98
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:54,210
And also how the integration works
between the data and the data governance.

99
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,870
So the first one, what we are
looking at is cloud benefits.

100
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,690
Some organizations implementing AI
solutions experience substantial

101
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,600
benefits from cloud deployment
models within infrastructure,

102
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,490
scalability, representing a primary.

103
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,710
Advantage Modern Implementations
leveraging the infrastructure

104
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:15,590
as code approaches to ensure
consistency and repeatability.

105
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:21,630
As an example, Airbnb uses Global
Cloud ca tools to scale ERP resources

106
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,235
during the peak booking seasons.

107
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:27,425
So the next one, what we are
looking at is data governance.

108
00:06:27,665 --> 00:06:32,735
Successful implementations employ
canon data models that normalize

109
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,645
termin knowledge and formats
across organizational boundaries.

110
00:06:36,215 --> 00:06:40,675
Organizations must establish clear
policies regarding data ownership, on

111
00:06:40,675 --> 00:06:43,345
quality standards and use permissions.

112
00:06:43,345 --> 00:06:44,365
Proctor and Gamble.

113
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:49,280
Procter and Gamble employs a canonical
data model in HCRP to standardize

114
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,680
global supply chain terminology.

115
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,260
So as an integration approach and data
pipeline automation maintains some data

116
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:01,790
freshness with the real time and near
real time data integration, enabling

117
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,590
more responsive predictive models.

118
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,545
Hybrid approaches optimize both data
governance and analytical performance.

119
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,015
Next one.

120
00:07:09,015 --> 00:07:12,285
What we are looking at is supply
chain optimization through ai.

121
00:07:12,675 --> 00:07:18,075
So because of this optimization through
ai, 23% average improvement compared to

122
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:22,845
traditional time series approaches and
also three plus successful implementation,

123
00:07:22,845 --> 00:07:28,635
combining ERP data with external factors,
so which results substantial reductions

124
00:07:28,685 --> 00:07:30,290
while maintaining service levels.

125
00:07:31,475 --> 00:07:36,215
Organizations implementing year driven
forecasting models experience significant

126
00:07:36,215 --> 00:07:40,425
improvements in supply chain operations,
particularly when addressing demand

127
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:43,005
volatility from market disruptions.

128
00:07:43,215 --> 00:07:46,485
The technical implementation
typically follows a phased approach,

129
00:07:46,905 --> 00:07:49,935
beginning with data integration,
followed by model deployment

130
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:55,025
under culminating in interactive
dashboards for scenario evolution.

131
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,110
So as in supply chain example,
Tesla combine CRP data with weather

132
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:05,030
APIs to optimize battery supply
chains, reducing delays by 25%.

133
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,400
That is a huge reduction
in delays for the Tesla.

134
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,170
So the next one, what we are
looking at is financial planning

135
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,880
and production optimization.

136
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,900
So as when we are implementing,
mission learning into ERP.

137
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,130
So we are looking at two, the three,
two different techniques here.

138
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:27,270
That is one is financial forecasting
organization enhance some financial

139
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:32,190
forecasting accuracy by implementing
mission learning algorithms that identify

140
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,360
complex relations between organizational
metrics and financial outcomes.

141
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,530
So JP Morgan uses mission learning
in Oracle ERP to predict cash flow

142
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,675
trends within 90% of accuracy.

143
00:08:43,545 --> 00:08:47,194
The next one is production scheduling
companies implementing machine learning

144
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,045
algorithms for production scheduling.

145
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:54,015
Experiences average reductions
of 18% in production lead times

146
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:55,814
compared to traditional approaches.

147
00:08:55,864 --> 00:08:59,944
So Toyota Reinforcement Learning
System in S-A-P-E-R-P cut the

148
00:08:59,944 --> 00:09:02,884
production lead times by 18%.

149
00:09:02,884 --> 00:09:06,604
So the reinforcement learning
advanced implementations supply

150
00:09:06,604 --> 00:09:10,074
employee reinforcement learning
techniques that continuously improve

151
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:13,974
the scheduling policies based on
observed outcomes gradually adopting

152
00:09:13,974 --> 00:09:16,224
to changing production constraints.

153
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:20,474
The next one, what we are going to discuss
about is how the manufacturing sector's

154
00:09:20,474 --> 00:09:26,254
implementation will impact the usage
of machine learning in the ERP sector.

155
00:09:26,254 --> 00:09:28,984
So here we defined four
different sections.

156
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:33,554
The first one is the requirement gathering
where where we will define business

157
00:09:33,554 --> 00:09:35,384
objects and the technical requirements.

158
00:09:35,384 --> 00:09:36,344
For the sector.

159
00:09:36,824 --> 00:09:40,424
And also the next one is data preparation,
where we will validate data quality

160
00:09:40,424 --> 00:09:42,194
and integration diverse sources.

161
00:09:42,294 --> 00:09:46,114
As part of the development we will
create and try and predict to algorithms

162
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:50,029
so that those algorithms will be
deployed at the time of, usage.

163
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:52,249
And the fourth one is integration testing.

164
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:55,739
Verify the system's compatibility
on the performance as part

165
00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:57,359
of your integration testing.

166
00:09:57,809 --> 00:10:01,779
So an automotive parts manufacturers
implementing and yay enhanced

167
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:06,249
forecasting system that delivered
remarkable operational implement some.

168
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:10,099
This solution incorporated both supervised
and unsupervised learning techniques to

169
00:10:10,099 --> 00:10:13,399
identify complex patterns in production.

170
00:10:13,749 --> 00:10:14,409
Variability.

171
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:17,769
The traditional statistical
methods had to fail to detect.

172
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:21,709
So overall when we are implementing
in the manufacturing sector, when

173
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:25,369
we implement both European and
machine learning, we will see lot

174
00:10:25,369 --> 00:10:27,779
of a lot of implementation cases.

175
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:33,419
So as an example, BMWA enhanced ERP
reduction, reduced product production

176
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,619
variability by 30% using GI gans.

177
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:37,859
Next one.

178
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:43,369
The next one, what we are discussing about
is how the retail and healthcare works.

179
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:50,309
When we implement EA in the into E-E-E-R-P
systems in ea. So why we are using for

180
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:54,559
example, the retail demand sensing, in
retail dimensions, say multi-channel

181
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,539
forecasting with external variables.

182
00:10:56,539 --> 00:11:01,379
JARAs, Oracle ERP integrates social media
sentiment analysis to adjust the inventory

183
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:04,109
weekly based on the social media.

184
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:07,679
They, they performed more more
sales, based on the sentiment

185
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,089
how the social media works.

186
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:13,799
And the next one, what we are looking
at is compliance integration, whereas

187
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,529
HIPAA complement data handled protocols.

188
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:21,279
In the healthcare system in the
healthcare system, myo Clinic uses

189
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:27,004
A-P-R-P-V-T-A to predict a patient
admissions reducing wait times by 15%.

190
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:30,619
And also the next one is markdown
reduction, improved allocation

191
00:11:30,619 --> 00:11:32,699
on timely replenishment.

192
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:34,859
When we use the ei,
that's what it happens.

193
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:38,309
Like the, it'll reduce, it'll improve
allocation on timely replacement.

194
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:40,889
The next one is healthcare
resource planning, optimize

195
00:11:40,979 --> 00:11:43,319
staffing and capacity utilization.

196
00:11:43,989 --> 00:11:47,304
So when we integrate with the a
multi-channel retailer deployed a

197
00:11:47,304 --> 00:11:50,364
comprehensive productive analytics
solution that incorporates social

198
00:11:50,364 --> 00:11:54,744
media sentiment analysis under
competitor pricing data, and regional

199
00:11:54,744 --> 00:11:58,194
economic indicators to generate
more accurate sales forecast.

200
00:11:58,674 --> 00:12:03,544
Similarly, a regional healthcare provider
implemented predictive analysis analytics

201
00:12:03,694 --> 00:12:07,384
to optimize the staffing levels under
source utilization while maintaining

202
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:09,184
the strict compliance requirements.

203
00:12:09,234 --> 00:12:13,604
So the, in the retail and healthcare
sector we will get more benefits

204
00:12:13,654 --> 00:12:15,696
when we integrate ERP with the ai.

205
00:12:16,664 --> 00:12:20,294
The next one, what we are looking at is
implementation results across industries.

206
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:26,034
Here we'll look at multiple
examples how how the ERP plus yay

207
00:12:26,314 --> 00:12:28,274
produced the results in a way.

208
00:12:29,194 --> 00:12:31,204
It enhances the overall industry.

209
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:36,734
For example, automated manufacturing where
they implemented SA PS four HANA as an

210
00:12:36,734 --> 00:12:44,714
ERP system using GaN GN based forecasting,
where it results, where it result 38 point

211
00:12:44,714 --> 00:12:50,314
37.88% of forecast accuracy improvement
and 4.7 million annual inventory sales.

212
00:12:50,364 --> 00:12:52,314
This was what happened for, with the fold.

213
00:12:52,884 --> 00:12:53,214
Ford.

214
00:12:53,264 --> 00:12:55,394
Ford, SAP S-A-P-E-R-P solution.

215
00:12:55,754 --> 00:12:58,604
And the next one, what we are
looking at is multi-channel retail.

216
00:12:58,604 --> 00:13:01,634
For example, let's take
imagine as example here.

217
00:13:01,844 --> 00:13:05,274
So they used Oracle retail as an
ERP solution, and used the time

218
00:13:05,274 --> 00:13:07,214
series with external variables.

219
00:13:07,264 --> 00:13:10,954
So which resulted in substantial
markdown reduction and improved the

220
00:13:10,954 --> 00:13:13,194
allocation percentages for Amazon.

221
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:17,094
The next one, what we are looking
at is in healthcare, where they use

222
00:13:17,094 --> 00:13:19,434
the epic systems as an ERP solution.

223
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:24,719
Where where used resource optimization
models as an AI technology, so

224
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:27,909
as in results it increases the
it optimized the staffing and

225
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:29,979
improved the capacity utilization.

226
00:13:30,624 --> 00:13:33,804
What we are looking at is data
quality and preparation challenges.

227
00:13:33,804 --> 00:13:37,074
And here again, here we defined
we differentiated into four

228
00:13:37,074 --> 00:13:38,454
to four different approaches.

229
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:42,014
The first one is initial validation
where we verify the data against

230
00:13:42,194 --> 00:13:43,574
predefined quality thresholds.

231
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:45,314
And the next one is standardization.

232
00:13:45,374 --> 00:13:48,314
Transform to consistent
format across sources.

233
00:13:48,804 --> 00:13:52,794
As an example, Nestle ERP
cleanses supply supplier data.

234
00:13:53,054 --> 00:13:57,579
Using AI and improved PP work,
we see by 35% when they, as

235
00:13:57,579 --> 00:13:58,899
part of the standardization.

236
00:13:59,469 --> 00:14:00,909
So the next one is enrichment.

237
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,059
So here we have to add derived features
and contextual information, which results

238
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:09,849
in the final verification confirms
the readiness of model in ingestion.

239
00:14:10,464 --> 00:14:15,774
So organization implementing Yay enhanced
ERP systems must address several critical

240
00:14:15,774 --> 00:14:20,379
data challenges, including inconsistency
across sources incompleteness of

241
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:23,289
historical records and semantic ambiguity.

242
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:27,609
These adopting semantic data
preparation methodologies experience

243
00:14:27,609 --> 00:14:30,949
significantly higher implementation
success rates compared to

244
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:32,784
those making ad hoc approaches.

245
00:14:32,884 --> 00:14:33,124
Okay.

246
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:36,204
In the next section, what we
are looking at is integration

247
00:14:36,204 --> 00:14:37,584
architecture considerations.

248
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:41,754
So here we look at successful
integration requires, developing locally

249
00:14:41,784 --> 00:14:46,314
coupled frameworks that isolate AI
components from underlying ERP systems

250
00:14:46,364 --> 00:14:50,054
enabling independent evolution while
maintaining functional integrity.

251
00:14:50,504 --> 00:14:53,174
The technological architecture
are generally incorporates some

252
00:14:53,354 --> 00:14:57,044
specialized in middleware components
that abstract the complexity of

253
00:14:57,044 --> 00:15:00,949
underlying ERP systems providing
standardized interfaces for AI services.

254
00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:01,454
Some.

255
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:06,299
So here, when we compare with the, between
different layers, like middleware layer,

256
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:10,649
event driven architecture, EAPI, component
integration patterns, error handling.

257
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:14,309
So when we are comparing between
implementation complexity and the

258
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:18,149
business impact the business impact is
more the implementation complexity is

259
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:22,689
there, but still the business impact
because of the implementation is huge.

260
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:26,735
That's where we need to consider
implementing AI plus ERP.

261
00:15:28,034 --> 00:15:31,604
The next one, what we are talking about
is model management and governance.

262
00:15:31,654 --> 00:15:35,089
So as part of this we need to
look for five different section.

263
00:15:35,179 --> 00:15:38,819
So the first one, what we do is create
and prime models with appropriate

264
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:40,499
validation as part of the development.

265
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:43,639
Once the development is completed,
verify the performance against and

266
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,409
performance ag business requirements.

267
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:47,654
Sir. This is as part of the validation.

268
00:15:47,894 --> 00:15:51,214
Once the business requirements
were verified, then we will

269
00:15:51,214 --> 00:15:54,204
implement the same in production
with monitoring capabilities.

270
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:57,524
And then we'll monitor to track
the performance and trigger

271
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:59,144
alerts whenever they require.

272
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:04,214
And then finally, we retire replace
outdated models with improved versions

273
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,379
that will results in that will
give them more more higher results.

274
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:12,209
So organizations implementing robust
model, governance processes experience

275
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:16,739
substantially lower operational incident
while maintaining higher prediction

276
00:16:16,739 --> 00:16:18,449
accuracy over extended periods.

277
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:23,159
The technical implementation typically
incorporates some automated monitoring

278
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:27,719
capabilities that track model
performance against established metrics

279
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:31,759
triggering alerts when degradation
exceeds predetermined thresholds.

280
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:34,659
What we are looking at
is future direction.

281
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:40,254
So here in this section, we'll discuss
how multi multimodal AI and edge

282
00:16:40,254 --> 00:16:45,504
computing, will result in different
sectors, so multimodal AI integration,

283
00:16:45,534 --> 00:16:50,354
advanced systems that process diverse
data or data types simultaneously,

284
00:16:50,624 --> 00:16:54,824
including structured ERP data with
unstructured content like text.

285
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:59,719
Images, audio on video to create more
comprehensive predictive models with

286
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,969
enhanced accuracy on the expandability.

287
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:07,039
As an example, GI Healthcare
combines MRI images with the RP data

288
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,009
to predict equipment maintenance.

289
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:13,759
The next one is edge computing
architecture, the distributed intelligence

290
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:17,709
that processes data locally at operational
endpoints including manufacturing,

291
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:22,429
facilities retail locations and logistics
centers reducing the latency while

292
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:24,379
enhancing the resilience and data.

293
00:17:24,379 --> 00:17:27,469
For geographically dispersed operations.

294
00:17:27,469 --> 00:17:33,179
Shell, this one used by Shell, shell
deploys a GA in oil rigs to process sensor

295
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:36,119
data locally reducing the latency by 60%.

296
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:40,919
The next one, what we are
looking at is model optimization.

297
00:17:41,349 --> 00:17:43,174
Is advanced techniques including.

298
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:49,064
Quantization pruning and the knowledge
of distillation that reduce computational

299
00:17:49,064 --> 00:17:52,994
requirements while preserving critical
predictive capabilities for deployment

300
00:17:53,474 --> 00:17:55,694
across diverse computing environments.

301
00:17:56,444 --> 00:17:58,544
So this is a, this is the future.

302
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,664
How it is going to be look
like, so the next one, what we

303
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,044
are looking at is the roadmap.

304
00:18:03,094 --> 00:18:04,564
So roadmap and conclusion.

305
00:18:04,594 --> 00:18:08,734
So as part of this we will look at
the phased implementation strategy,

306
00:18:08,764 --> 00:18:10,714
assessment and organizational alignment.

307
00:18:10,764 --> 00:18:14,594
So as part of the strategy assessment
evaluate organizational readiness.

308
00:18:14,604 --> 00:18:18,774
Some and identify high value use cases
that align with business objectives.

309
00:18:18,854 --> 00:18:22,214
Establish clear success metrics
on governance frameworks

310
00:18:22,214 --> 00:18:24,004
for implementation journey.

311
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:28,804
And the next one, what we use is ask the,
we need to follow the phased approach.

312
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:33,279
Follow a structured approach with
proof of concept validation, scale

313
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,169
development, and continuous improvement.

314
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:38,759
This enables a progressive
capability building while

315
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:40,979
demonstrating value incrementally.

316
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:43,679
So the next one is
organizational alignment.

317
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:47,309
Established a dedicated center
of excellence, combining

318
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:48,569
technical specialists.

319
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:51,799
Business domain experts under
change management professionals

320
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:55,069
to ensure successful adoption
and ongoing optimization.

321
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,029
The integration of generative AI
with ERP cloud system represents

322
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:02,899
a significant advancement in
enterprise technology capabilities.

323
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:07,819
Organizations that effectively harness
these capabilities gain substantial

324
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:13,329
advantages to improve forecasting
accuracy and enhanced resource

325
00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:16,229
allocation and more agile response soon.

326
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:18,664
Responses to market fluctuations.

327
00:19:18,714 --> 00:19:19,764
Hey, thank you.

328
00:19:19,794 --> 00:19:21,864
Thank you everyone for
attending this conference.

329
00:19:21,914 --> 00:19:25,064
Please reach out to me on if
we have any questions regarding

330
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:30,194
implementing ERP and AI artificial
intelligence e in ERP systems.

331
00:19:30,194 --> 00:19:35,034
So that will result that will give huge
benefits to all the industry sector.

332
00:19:35,034 --> 00:19:36,894
So thank you.
