00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,470
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,420
I'm pre Patil from Equinix.

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,420
I build multi-cloud infrastructure
and interconnection for

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,860
high performance AI needs.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,500
Thank you for joining me to
explore my talk for reactive

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,520
prompts to autonomous agents, LLMs
for multi-cloud infrastructure.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:24,480
Over this past year, I have spent a lot
of time on exploring the next stage of

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,210
cloud deployment in the world of ai.

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,910
We have seen Terraform and cross.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,690
Planes facilitate cloud deployment
and maintain the desired state

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,910
using reconciliation loop.

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,250
That worked well for many years, but now
is the time to advance it even further.

13
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:48,120
In this talk, we will see how large
language models LLMs are exploring

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,940
and evolving and not just answering
our questions to actively managing

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,410
complex cloud infrastructures.

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,500
This shift from manually reactive prompts
to autonomous agent behavior is poised

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,269
to revolutionize cloud infrastructure.

18
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:08,179
Gartner has said the agentic
AI is a top trend of 2025.

19
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,890
We don't need Gartner to say that.

20
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,000
We all know that by now.

21
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:18,140
In this talk, we'll talk about how
multicloud can leverage agent tech ai,

22
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,645
talking about AWS Azure GCP even on-prem.

23
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,429
A full hybrid mix, if you will.

24
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:31,530
We will discuss on how LLM can move
beyond merely splitting the config

25
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,590
snippets to actually orchestrating the
tasks across multi-cloud, all while

26
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,810
balancing the exciting opportunities
with very real risks, the hallucinations,

27
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,730
misconfigurations, and the cost.

28
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:50,720
Most enterprises run at least two
public clouds plus co-location on-prem.

29
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,090
Facilitated by S like Equinix.

30
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,890
They all have different IMS
network models, APIs and billing.

31
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,940
Billing knobs.

32
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:05,090
The result is a config sprawl, policy
divergence and reconciliation drift.

33
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:11,780
Old fix was write a glue script or a
terraform and have PR reviews at scale.

34
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:17,030
The glue on the Terraforms and the cross
planes became second platform to maintain.

35
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:22,314
Sometimes if people don't maintain
the GitHubs model, then we would end

36
00:02:22,314 --> 00:02:24,714
up having them as tribal knowledges.

37
00:02:25,614 --> 00:02:29,439
What we want instead is a continuous
awareness of state across the providers.

38
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:35,514
Policy driven orchestration and autonomic
reconciliation that respects the change.

39
00:02:35,514 --> 00:02:37,434
Window approvals and budget.

40
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:43,214
Think treating cloud boundaries like
availability zones with explicit

41
00:02:43,214 --> 00:02:45,395
control, our cost, and other risks.

42
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:49,614
And what most teams
today use LMS reactive.

43
00:02:49,674 --> 00:02:52,765
Ask cha g pity for a Terraform script.

44
00:02:53,265 --> 00:02:56,295
Tell me how to connect
a LB to my target group.

45
00:02:56,345 --> 00:03:02,374
And the VPCs, if it does generate
good scripts, no doubt about that.

46
00:03:02,494 --> 00:03:07,834
But you end up with a lot of on off
scripts without full validation and with

47
00:03:07,885 --> 00:03:10,995
full confidence, we don't docs anymore.

48
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,750
Neither does cha G PT or any
LMS would just end up giving us

49
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,440
information that it best knows it.

50
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,940
So for one good.

51
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,980
And is we wrote a chat assistant and
asked to write a clean VPC module.

52
00:03:27,365 --> 00:03:33,815
And it did in minutes, but all it did
was apart from building a VPC module,

53
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:41,225
it also had a place where it would
open up all the traffic and all that

54
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:46,890
because we forgot to mention a bion host
restriction, nice code, wrong outcome.

55
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,115
The lesson without.

56
00:03:49,725 --> 00:03:54,345
Context and checks, you are accelerating
both right and wrong changes.

57
00:03:54,845 --> 00:04:00,575
So what should be the vision of having
an autonomous agent of this sort?

58
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,335
It should have continuous awareness.

59
00:04:03,695 --> 00:04:07,355
Take snapshots of multi-cloud
states, drifts and quotas.

60
00:04:08,075 --> 00:04:11,765
It should have proactive de
detections for misconfigurations,

61
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:16,345
security vulnerabilities, cost
anomalies, and a autonomous.

62
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:21,190
Resolution, propose and execute
fixes with approvals and rollbacks.

63
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,230
Think of this agent as a junior, SRE
with excellent documentation recall

64
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,259
wrapped under strict guardrails.

65
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:35,414
It suggests and even allowed to
execute and then explains what it did.

66
00:04:36,314 --> 00:04:41,744
The core of this architecture is Ritual
Augmented Generation, also known as rag.

67
00:04:42,104 --> 00:04:48,764
The difference here with RAG is between
confident fiction and grounded action.

68
00:04:49,694 --> 00:04:52,094
The retrievals will be that of.

69
00:04:52,705 --> 00:04:54,025
Current desired state.

70
00:04:54,265 --> 00:04:58,265
Think terraform Terraform
states, terraform documentations

71
00:04:58,344 --> 00:04:59,925
scripts cloud formation.

72
00:05:00,405 --> 00:05:04,935
It'll will also will look into
actual states through cloud APIs.

73
00:05:05,614 --> 00:05:11,674
It'll look into change histories,
think logs, prs, run books

74
00:05:12,034 --> 00:05:16,744
policies like security policies,
FinTech policies provider docs.

75
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,929
Not only a p aspects,
but also best practices.

76
00:05:19,929 --> 00:05:24,959
Amazon always provides well architected
writeups and they are very resourceful

77
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:32,189
model plans With this in context and not
just the blank state example can think

78
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:37,409
of before touching a security group, the
agent reduce the intent port for IAC.

79
00:05:38,344 --> 00:05:43,004
Our infrastructure as code pulls
all the current rules from AWS that

80
00:05:43,064 --> 00:05:48,724
already in is presenting your infras
policies that you have set up ahead of

81
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:54,034
time telling for bidding, opening all
the poor for admin VPCs for example,

82
00:05:54,394 --> 00:05:56,134
and any change tickets over the time.

83
00:05:56,494 --> 00:05:58,564
The output of this is a proposed diff.

84
00:05:59,184 --> 00:06:02,064
Plus the rationale on why
we are doing certain things.

85
00:06:02,564 --> 00:06:05,715
The next piece of the architecture
is where you get your confidence

86
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:07,184
with the verification pipeline.

87
00:06:08,094 --> 00:06:08,215
It.

88
00:06:08,215 --> 00:06:10,705
Start off with syntax validation.

89
00:06:11,335 --> 00:06:12,895
Yamo, JSO, Terraform.

90
00:06:13,395 --> 00:06:17,775
Do the linting, do the formatting,
then is the semantic analysis.

91
00:06:18,374 --> 00:06:22,575
Logically thinking what it
is doing is right or wrong.

92
00:06:23,085 --> 00:06:25,155
Think of reasoning models here.

93
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:31,244
Then the guard rails for all your
policy, compliances, budgets,

94
00:06:31,304 --> 00:06:34,034
tax encryption, geo residency.

95
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:37,674
GDPR kind of compliances whatnot, right?

96
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:43,974
And then finally, your dry run
testing, Terraform Plan cube

97
00:06:43,974 --> 00:06:48,529
cut diff your smoke test on your
staging environment, et cetera.

98
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:50,329
I also recommend.

99
00:06:51,084 --> 00:06:55,614
Doing a dual model verification
where the second model of a rules

100
00:06:55,614 --> 00:07:00,714
engine would critique the plan,
ask why is it doing a certain way?

101
00:07:00,774 --> 00:07:01,554
Is it required?

102
00:07:02,094 --> 00:07:03,654
What can go wrong?

103
00:07:04,014 --> 00:07:07,814
Think of red teaming the real
value of these autonomous agents.

104
00:07:07,814 --> 00:07:11,589
It's not just during the deployment,
but between the deployments.

105
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:15,909
The agents will continuously
monitor across the clouds for

106
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:19,239
any changes like I am Devs.

107
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:25,019
Route table changes health of your
load, balance, quotas pricing.

108
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:30,869
It detects the drift automatically
and tries to correct it.

109
00:07:31,634 --> 00:07:32,704
Alert with context.

110
00:07:33,514 --> 00:07:38,734
Which is more significant than
we all think, and once it.

111
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:45,529
Identifies any of these changes, it then
runs its reconciliation using, either

112
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:51,739
by opening a PR and having somebody
approve it, or if it is pre-approved,

113
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:54,379
it could just proceed with deployment.

114
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,169
A practical example, right?

115
00:07:57,219 --> 00:07:59,709
This is anecdotal happened to me.

116
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:04,459
One of the members who had access
to the, to an AWS account made

117
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:06,259
modifications to a security group.

118
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:12,749
Now we all in the team had to go all over
the place, try to see what happened, when

119
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:19,519
things were not working without clarity on
where to reach and what to do to fix this.

120
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:25,669
If the agent and autonomous agent was
there, it already has complete context

121
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:31,009
of the desired state and it can run
its reconciliation rule and propose

122
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:35,729
the solution and also propose what
went wrong on a certain scenarios.

123
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:41,169
While all of this sounds great,
there are problems starting with

124
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:42,609
hallucinated configurations.

125
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,349
We have seen that LMS as we know it today.

126
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:53,829
Can end up hallucinating and getting
to the same rabbit hole of trying to

127
00:08:54,249 --> 00:08:56,319
solve a problem that doesn't even exist.

128
00:08:56,819 --> 00:09:02,459
Then security exposure, we might end
up over giving overprivileged to agent

129
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:07,199
and that can cause a huge problem.

130
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:10,009
Cost escalations of if there is no.

131
00:09:10,654 --> 00:09:15,274
Proper guardrails, we might end up
overspending on certain resources we

132
00:09:15,274 --> 00:09:17,344
might even end up overspending on.

133
00:09:17,884 --> 00:09:22,344
Additional cost medication
is very straightforward.

134
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:30,104
Always validate your resources and
deployments unit tests and automated

135
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:34,844
tests to verify that agents are
behaving as they're expected.

136
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:41,189
Most importantly, least, and on
demand privileges always provide

137
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:45,449
privilege only to the resources
that the agent needs at the time.

138
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:49,649
It needs then cost control, not
just for the cloud resources, but

139
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:52,229
also for the agent's inference.

140
00:09:52,979 --> 00:09:54,884
But trust doesn't come automatically.

141
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:58,739
Trust comes with transparency,
reversibility, and learning.

142
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:03,229
We need to log all the LLMs
decisions and reasoning.

143
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,109
Bring human in the loop.

144
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:11,019
Have a tiered approval time
boxed change windows so that you

145
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:12,699
are in control of the change.

146
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:18,009
Not in the middle of the night or
at 2:00 AM have rollback mechanism.

147
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:24,734
Every agent action must map to a version
artifact for instant rollbacks, and

148
00:10:24,734 --> 00:10:31,049
then the continuous learning to fine
tune your agents meeting your needs.

149
00:10:31,574 --> 00:10:35,504
Based on all the learnings that
you have had and the agents

150
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:37,604
have had based on all the logs.

151
00:10:38,384 --> 00:10:42,794
While this framework is very
encouraging and exciting, it can also

152
00:10:42,794 --> 00:10:48,164
be very overwhelming in terms of its
implementation in your environment.

153
00:10:48,734 --> 00:10:54,009
So I recommend to start off simple,
start with reactive announcement.

154
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:58,274
When I say that, think about
keeping your current flow as it is.

155
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,359
Just add retrievals and validation
around LLM generated artifacts.

156
00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:09,520
Next stage is integrate, rag rag can
start off with your documentation,

157
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,670
your infrastructure as code, some
run books some well architected or

158
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,439
best practices from the providers.

159
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,410
Then start off with continuous monitoring.

160
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:23,670
Have your agents start detecting
drifts and reporting them.

161
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:28,609
And the final stage when all the
confidence is in place, start

162
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:33,530
with deployment and autonomous
actions with human in the loop and

163
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,810
with the change window in mind.

164
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:41,020
So the key takeaways here is to use
AI like it was always meant to be,

165
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:49,030
not just for copy pasting code, but to
leverage its reasoning and its knowledge.

166
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,329
Start off very simple.

167
00:11:52,094 --> 00:11:55,274
Take small steps and have
an incremental adoption.

168
00:11:55,964 --> 00:12:00,674
Build a robust architecture around
