18
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:25,000
important ethical considerations that
come with adapting these new technologies.

19
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,290
We will also reflect on how AI
impacts our skills as developers

20
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:34,450
and the broader societal benefits
that arise from these advancements.

21
00:01:35,089 --> 00:01:38,200
Finally, we will wrap with
some concluding thoughts.

22
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,399
So let's dive in.

23
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:43,210
To set the stage, let's talk
about where we are today

24
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,870
regarding developer productivity.

25
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:50,390
As many of you can relate, the
complexity of modern frameworks and

26
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,060
libraries has grown exponentially.

27
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,230
New technologies emerge almost
daily and keeping up with the latest

28
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,660
trends requires continuous learning.

29
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,560
This rapid evolution can be overwhelming
even for seasoned developers.

30
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,630
At the same time, we are often
faced with limited resources.

31
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:14,330
The demand for software solutions
is higher than ever, but time,

32
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,000
skilled professional, and budgets
are frequently constrained.

33
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,510
We are expected to deliver high quality
software quickly, which adds pressure

34
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,630
to our already demanding roles.

35
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,450
One striking statistic is that
developers spend nearly 30 percent

36
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,960
of their time debugging, resolving
tech debt and fixing errors.

37
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,860
That's a significant portion of our
workday dedicated to finding and

38
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,750
fixing errors rather than building new
features or improving the existing ones.

39
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,240
This not only slows down the
development process, but also

40
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,670
can be quite frustrating.

41
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,810
Current solutions like manual code
reviews and traditional debugging tools

42
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,720
certainly help, but they have limitations.

43
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:04,590
Manual code reviews can miss subtle
bugs or edge cases and require

44
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,050
coordination among team members,
which can introduce delays.

45
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,920
Without real time assistance,
we might spend considerable time

46
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:17,480
searching for solutions, reading
through documentation or experimenting

47
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,670
with different approaches.

48
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,740
This is where artificial
intelligence comes into play.

49
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,780
AI has potential to act as an
intelligent assistant, providing

50
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,850
immediate and context aware support.

51
00:03:30,385 --> 00:03:37,345
It can reduce repetitive tasks, accelerate
workflows, and allow us to focus on more

52
00:03:37,445 --> 00:03:42,545
critical aspects of software development,
such as designing robust architectures,

53
00:03:42,905 --> 00:03:44,975
or implementing innovative features.

54
00:03:45,445 --> 00:03:50,245
In essence, AI can enhance our
capabilities, making us more

55
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:53,085
efficient and effective in our roles.

56
00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:59,335
Now, let's explore what AI driven
coding assistants are and how

57
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:01,095
they are transforming our work.

58
00:04:01,595 --> 00:04:06,085
These tools leverage machine learning
and natural language processing

59
00:04:06,535 --> 00:04:08,295
to assist us in writing code.

60
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:14,225
Some prominent examples like GitHub
Copilot, IntelliCode, Tab9, and

61
00:04:14,225 --> 00:04:16,415
Kite, and most recently, Cursor.

62
00:04:16,915 --> 00:04:20,085
They integrate with our development
environments to provide real

63
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,355
time coding suggestions.

64
00:04:21,855 --> 00:04:26,295
completions, and even entire code
snippets based on the context

65
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,105
of what we are working on.

66
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:33,915
These assistants offer features that
significantly boost productivity.

67
00:04:34,345 --> 00:04:39,675
For instance, they can provide
intelligent code completions that can

68
00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:42,275
reduce the need for repetitive typing.

69
00:04:42,785 --> 00:04:47,435
Imagine typing the beginning of a
function and having the assistant

70
00:04:47,445 --> 00:04:52,575
suggest the rest accurately,
predicting what you intended to write.

71
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:56,180
They also help with
real time bug detection.

72
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,640
As we code, they can identify potential
errors or code smells, allowing us

73
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,410
to address issues immediately rather
than during later testing phases.

74
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:11,889
This immediate feedback loop helps
maintain code quality and reduces

75
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,450
the time spent on debugging.

76
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,390
Moreover, they can suggest ways
to refactor and optimize code.

77
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:24,380
Perhaps there is a more efficient way to
perform a task or a newer library function

78
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,220
that simplifies a complex operation.

79
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,350
The AI assistant can bring these
to our attention, helping us write

80
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,080
cleaner and more efficient code.

81
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,870
In practical terms, these tools
have shown remarkable impact.

82
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:45,215
For example, Developers using GitHub
Copilot have reported completing tasks

83
00:05:45,455 --> 00:05:49,375
significantly faster, some by up to 55%.

84
00:05:49,895 --> 00:05:54,804
Many find that they can focus more
on the logic and design aspects of

85
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:59,445
their projects rather than bogged down
by the syntax or boilerplate code.

86
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:06,135
Personally, I recall working on a
project involving a complex algorithm

87
00:06:07,115 --> 00:06:11,604
I was not entirely familiar with
using an AI coding assistant.

88
00:06:12,345 --> 00:06:16,055
I received suggestions that not
only helped me to implement the

89
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:19,995
algorithm correctly, but also
introduced me to more efficient

90
00:06:19,995 --> 00:06:21,875
approaches that I had not considered.

91
00:06:22,825 --> 00:06:27,815
This experience saved me hours of
research and trial and error coding.

92
00:06:28,315 --> 00:06:34,075

these assistants with our package

99
00:07:00,695 --> 00:07:03,885
management systems, such as NuGet, NPM.

100
00:07:04,385 --> 00:07:09,045
By doing so, the AI can analyze
our project dependencies and

101
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:14,355
imports by giving us suggestions
that are tailored to the specific

102
00:07:14,355 --> 00:07:16,715
libraries and versions we are using.

103
00:07:17,515 --> 00:07:22,468
For example, if we are working with a
particular version of a framework that has

104
00:07:22,468 --> 00:07:28,030
unique functions or syntax, the AI coding
assistant will can provide code that is

105
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,560
compatible and optimized for that version.

106
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,350
AI models use techniques like
embeddings, to comprehend the

107
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,940
semantic meaning of our code.

108
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,870
This deep understanding helps
the AI make predictions that are

109
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,450
not just syntactically correct,
but contextually appropriate.

110
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:52,640
Additionally, retrieval argumented
generation, RRAC, combines the AI

111
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,270
trained knowledge with our local
code basis and documentation.

112
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:03,040
This means that AI can reference
specific instructions, functions,

113
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:08,180
classes, or patterns that are unique
to our project, enhancing the quality

114
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,360
of its suggestions and acceptance.

115
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,930
By providing the right context,
we make these AI driven tools more

116
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,480
precise and tailored to our needs.

117
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,618
This involves practices like clear
code commenting, clean code, consistent

118
00:08:24,618 --> 00:08:29,549
coding styles, and sharing relevant
project files with the AI assistant.

119
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,470
All within the boundaries of
privacy and security guidelines.

120
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:39,260
