1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:02,370
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:03,690
Very warm.

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,100
Welcome to all of you.

4
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:08,790
I'm really excited and honored
to be part of this conference.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,760
I want to share my thoughts
with all of you today.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,570
I'm Bala working as an expert software
engineer in one of the incidents leading

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,670
Nsurance companies in the United States.

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,930
Today I'm going to talk about how
artificial intelligence and human

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,580
expertise are working together.

10
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:29,925
Drive operational excellence
in the insurance industry.

11
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:37,575
Insurance is something we all experience,
whether it is a health insurance or

12
00:00:37,575 --> 00:00:43,485
insurance at home insurance, but many
people do not realize how much technology

13
00:00:43,725 --> 00:00:49,185
works behind the scenes to make the
process faster, safer, and better.

14
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:54,435
My goal in this present presentation
is to explain how AI helps

15
00:00:54,435 --> 00:00:56,325
insurance companies become smarter.

16
00:00:57,194 --> 00:01:03,165
More efficient, but at the same time,
human skills like empathy, judgment,

17
00:01:03,224 --> 00:01:05,804
and experience are still very important.

18
00:01:07,095 --> 00:01:12,225
We'll share real life examples from
insurance operations so that everyone

19
00:01:12,225 --> 00:01:14,085
can easily understand this topic.

20
00:01:15,225 --> 00:01:17,229
Let's begin the journey together.

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,880
Let's first understand
how AI brings a major

22
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,710
shift in the way of the way
insurance companies operate today.

23
00:01:33,445 --> 00:01:36,145
AI is changing insurance
operations in a big way.

24
00:01:36,685 --> 00:01:43,080
It helps in three important areas,
improving efficiency, increasing

25
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,780
company growth, and reducing cost.

26
00:01:46,695 --> 00:01:49,065
Let's talk about improving the efficiency.

27
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:56,595
A improves the efficiency by
automating tasks that use to take this.

28
00:01:57,285 --> 00:02:03,165
For example, when someone applies for
health insurance, a systems can check

29
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:08,805
their medical reports, analyze risks, and
provide a premium code within a minutes.

30
00:02:09,914 --> 00:02:12,675
And the second one is AA helps companies.

31
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,320
Grow by creating a smart pricing models.

32
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:23,160
For instance, if a customer installs a
smart device in their car to monitor safe

33
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,340
driving, the company can offer discounts.

34
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:32,345
This attracts more to the customers so
that they can expect more customers come,

35
00:02:32,855 --> 00:02:35,130
will come on onboard to our insurance.

36
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,650
Carbon is they reduce operational
cost by automating routine work.

37
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:47,040
Earlier insurance companies
had a large call centers to

38
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,870
handle the customer questions.

39
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,600
Now a chat bots can answer basic
questions, but four by seven,

40
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,820
it's saving a lot of time and
money to the insurance companies.

41
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:03,540
All these changes are helping
insurance companies to offer

42
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,180
faster

43
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,620
processing, better decisions,
and more personalized services.

44
00:03:16,185 --> 00:03:18,255
Despite all these technologies,

45
00:03:18,885 --> 00:03:20,895
human expertise remains criticals.

46
00:03:21,195 --> 00:03:25,215
Let us see why humans are still
important in in this AI driven world.

47
00:03:27,825 --> 00:03:30,285
While AI handles many tasks, there are

48
00:03:30,855 --> 00:03:33,105
something that only humans can do well.

49
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,775
There is a car accident involves.

50
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,570
Multiple vehicles and legal disputes.

51
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:48,480
A human claims adjuster is required to
handle the situation fairly in fraud.

52
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,880
Detections A can catch patterns,
but human investigators are better

53
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:00,630
at identifying lies are unusual
behavior during a call in customer

54
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,180
service, especially during a sensor.

55
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,980
Situations like that claim
are a major accident policy.

56
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:11,970
Only a human can provide
empathy and comfort.

57
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,339
That is why human expertise
will always be sharing insurance

58
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,980
industries to handle complex

59
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,320
emotional sensitive situations.

60
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,849
Now let us look at how AI
users data to make smarter

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,664
risk assessments.

62
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:38,190
A systems use advanced data analytics
to evaluate risk more accurately.

63
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,730
For example, in health insurance, a
can analyze years of medical reports

64
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:50,565
for particular personal to understand
how, which, like smoking or drink

65
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:52,445
drinking, increase the health risk.

66
00:04:53,345 --> 00:04:56,940
It can also monitor customer
behaviors like exercise

67
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,800
habits using fitness strikers.

68
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:04,125
This allows insurance companies
to offer better plans.

69
00:05:04,815 --> 00:05:10,005
For instance, a person who access
daily needs healthy may get a lower

70
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:12,225
premium and compared with other process.

71
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:17,655
Similarly, AI can adjust car insurance
premiums based on the driving

72
00:05:17,655 --> 00:05:23,985
behavior of the persons people
who can drive those cars safely

73
00:05:24,045 --> 00:05:25,545
and following the speeding limits.

74
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,570
And if they don't have any.

75
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,520
Decades that are issued at so that
they will get a better pricing.

76
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,099
AI also helps detect hidden
patterns in past claims, which

77
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:40,800
humans may miss, essentials,

78
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:43,800
accurate risk prediction,
and fair pricing.

79
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,065
Now let's see how AI helps
managing risk in real time and

80
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:52,945
protect customers.

81
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:53,670
A,

82
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:59,790
a enables real time monitoring of risk
and provides proactive alert to customers.

83
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:07,710
For example, a, a systems track,
weather patterns and can select then

84
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:13,080
the alerts about upcoming flights,
storms to the customers so that the

85
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,420
customers can react immediately.

86
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,790
And if there is a spread in a
particular area, a customer may

87
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,770
receive a message just to move there.

88
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,950
Um, car and family to a different
locations and take the safety measures.

89
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,930
AA three calculate risk level
based on changing situations.

90
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,370
For example, the customer
installs a smart, smart

91
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,320
security device at their home.

92
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:46,830
The risk of the theft goes down and
then insurance premium may reduce.

93
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:52,515
This prior to risk management, not
only protects customers, but also

94
00:06:52,515 --> 00:06:53,955
helps insurance companies reduce

95
00:06:54,285 --> 00:06:55,935
claims and lose losses.

96
00:07:01,695 --> 00:07:03,165
So let's go into the next slide.

97
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:04,970
Let us explore how

98
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,970
companies balance between, um,
automation with human judgment,

99
00:07:09,435 --> 00:07:11,235
but better decision making.

100
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:15,375
It is perfect for handling
routine and tri tasks.

101
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:20,925
For example, a customer files a claim
for a small repair, like a broken window.

102
00:07:21,945 --> 00:07:27,345
A can verify the details and approve
the claim instantly within few minutes.

103
00:07:27,945 --> 00:07:33,555
But for complex cases, like a major
plan accident are a liability dispute.

104
00:07:34,605 --> 00:07:37,305
AI systems plank the
case for human review.

105
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,080
So human upgrade their experience in
this scenario, assess the situation

106
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,600
deeply and make the final decisions.

107
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,690
This collaboration, nqs speed,

108
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,450
accuracy, and customer satisfactions.

109
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,910
Let us now see how AI
improves claims processing and

110
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,160
makes life easier for customers.

111
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,480
AI has completely changed
how claims are processed.

112
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:13,170
Earlier when you look at, uh, the way
the claims are processing, the customer

113
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:19,080
have to submit a claim and it has to
be manually, uh, reviewed by, uh, some

114
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,825
human and they have to take the decision.

115
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:26,940
The entire process took around some
three to five business days, but coming

116
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:32,159
to the aa, what we can do is, and
use some OC technologies and whatever

117
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,020
the documents that customer uploads.

118
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,835
We use the AI technologies
and we extract that data.

119
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:45,405
We can, a, can take the decisions whether
it has to process the claims or not.

120
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:46,155
Within emanate,

121
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:53,625
uh, this has reduced the efforts
and improves the transparency and

122
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,905
increase the customer satisfaction by

123
00:08:56,115 --> 00:08:57,615
30% in many companies.

124
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,125
It does now look at how we
a, a detects fraud claim.

125
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:11,790
Effectively, a is very
powerful in detecting

126
00:09:12,569 --> 00:09:13,199
frauds.

127
00:09:13,859 --> 00:09:17,910
It analyze large amounts of data
to catch eligible claim patterns.

128
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,439
For example, the same person files
multiple claims for different

129
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:24,359
locations for the same Danish.

130
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:28,185
A systems can catch this
pattern very easily.

131
00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:35,175
AI also does network analysis, which
means that maps the relationship between

132
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:41,355
the claimants and service providers
to predict the fraud rings behavior

133
00:09:41,355 --> 00:09:46,935
analysis, which helps us to identify the
suspicious languages in claims forms,

134
00:09:47,715 --> 00:09:52,065
which means, uh, it means a person
changing their story multiple times.

135
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,770
System alerts a human
investigator is needed.

136
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,010
This has increased the fraud detection

137
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,040
rates by 35% in many insurance companies.

138
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,675
Now let us understand why human
tech is still necessary in

139
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:12,595
complex cases.

140
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:19,980
A cannot handle emotional situations
or complex negotiations, for example.

141
00:10:22,035 --> 00:10:22,995
Disaster like

142
00:10:25,365 --> 00:10:29,895
customers needs help supporting to
guide them through the claims process.

143
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:32,985
In disputes involving multiple parties.

144
00:10:33,735 --> 00:10:40,064
Human adjusters handle legal discussions
and make fair decisions since the

145
00:10:40,064 --> 00:10:45,165
negotiations like setting a life
insurance claim require empathy and

146
00:10:45,165 --> 00:10:47,985
understanding only humans can provide.

147
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,015
Provides the data support, but

148
00:10:51,225 --> 00:10:54,435
humans handle the conversations
and emotional aspects.

149
00:10:59,985 --> 00:11:02,910
Let us now look at how
the market for AI and

150
00:11:02,915 --> 00:11:04,485
insurance is growing rapidly.

151
00:11:05,805 --> 00:11:08,775
The AI insurance market
is growing very fast.

152
00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:14,715
The report suggests that the market
will grow at the rate of 47% til 2027.

153
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:18,915
Health insurance will be the
largest segment contributing

154
00:11:18,915 --> 00:11:21,075
35% of the total market value.

155
00:11:22,065 --> 00:11:28,005
Many leading insurance companies are
ing in like card bots, automated claims

156
00:11:28,005 --> 00:11:31,005
processing, and predictive analytics.

157
00:11:31,785 --> 00:11:36,195
For example, the customer today
can generate their insurance codes,

158
00:11:36,465 --> 00:11:39,795
file claims, and check policy
details on their mobile apps.

159
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:43,964
It is all powered by a.
This trend shows that

160
00:11:44,055 --> 00:11:46,334
AI will play a huge role in the future.

161
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:47,114
Insurance.

162
00:11:52,305 --> 00:11:55,814
Finally, let us see how AI and
human collaborations will shape in

163
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:56,415
future.

164
00:11:58,155 --> 00:12:03,135
The future of insurance lies the perfect
collaboration between AI and humans.

165
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:08,444
AI will handle work, it improves
the efficiency by party percent and

166
00:12:09,464 --> 00:12:11,050
reduce the operational cost by 25%.

167
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:16,800
Human expert will continue to handle
complex and sensitive situations.

168
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:22,949
Customer satisfaction is as expected
to improve by 60% because of faster

169
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:24,660
and more personalized services.

170
00:12:25,859 --> 00:12:30,209
For example, a may offer a
personalized insurance plan based on

171
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:34,410
the customer behavior, and a human
advisor will discuss the benefits and

172
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:38,189
help the customers choose the best
