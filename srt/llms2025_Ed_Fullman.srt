00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,530
Hello, my name's Ed Fullman.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:07,290
Our topic today is harnessing large
language models for customer experience.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,710
We're going to look back at the past
a little bit and then forward into AI

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,820
and new technologies and their impact
on customer experience management.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,340
A little bit about me.

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,370
I've been working in
technology for over 40 years.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,310
I'm an engineer.

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,780
He started as a programmer.

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,240
I. Many years ago, my focus now is mainly
on innovation and new product introduction

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,390
and specifically product management and
lead leading, global engineering teams.

11
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,180
In the past, I've been more
directly involved with call

12
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,010
centers and CX operations.

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,490
the largest was A BPO
that I was a leader of.

14
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:52,890
For a large telecom, and their broadband
support where there were 4,000 agents

15
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,020
in seven countries from multiple
vendors, that I pulled together and,

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,640
That was a experience that obviously
was very informative about some of the

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,660
opportunities and some of the challenges
that call centers have to deal with.

18
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,380
But I've also worked on the
technology side of call centers

19
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,690
and, CX in general, multimodal.

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,670
a lot of my focus, in the two
thousands and 2010s was about, the

21
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,290
technology to deliver the calls.

22
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:24,135
voiceover IP and other things like that.

23
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:29,325
And then in, in more recent years, in
the last 15 or so, machine learning

24
00:01:29,385 --> 00:01:36,785
applied to, targeting for loyalty and
sales and also for trying to personalize

25
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:38,555
calls and personalized offers.

26
00:01:39,095 --> 00:01:43,955
So a lot of the stuff we're gonna talk
about today, I've done with one technology

27
00:01:43,955 --> 00:01:46,195
or another, or set of technologies.

28
00:01:46,915 --> 00:01:48,895
And I've done it in multiple industries.

29
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:57,085
Today at Veritas, I'm Chief Product
Officer and our focus is on, cloud Native

30
00:01:57,505 --> 00:02:02,065
Edge and distributed architectures running
various kinds of technologies to deliver

31
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:04,345
high value automation for customers.

32
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:08,395
Veritas means truth and automation.

33
00:02:09,055 --> 00:02:13,465
the kind of problems that we're
after have a need to, they range

34
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:19,105
from solving problems that involve
hardware to fully automated solutions.

35
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:24,895
what's probably different at some
level with what we do is that, we're

36
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,005
not just building these things.

37
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:30,325
We're operating also these
kind of platforms and, those

38
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:31,945
platforms have generated.

39
00:02:32,905 --> 00:02:36,935
Billions of dollars for big brands that
we work with through our, partners.

40
00:02:36,995 --> 00:02:42,225
And, we've generated billions
of transactions each year, that

41
00:02:42,315 --> 00:02:43,935
are processed by our systems.

42
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:48,295
So there's a lot of, customer
involvement, consumer involvement as well.

43
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:52,785
And, we're, we have a lot of familiarity
with that and a lot of focus on that.

44
00:02:53,285 --> 00:02:57,935
So some of the technologies and areas
of development that we focus on are,

45
00:02:58,035 --> 00:03:04,635
everything from staff supplementation
and building applications to more

46
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:09,705
process and project and product
oriented solutions that we deliver.

47
00:03:10,245 --> 00:03:14,985
the, we're involved a lot in
development of AI and analytics.

48
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,189
we specialize in, cloud native
solutions involving Kubernetes.

49
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,390
from the cloud to the edge, we
have expertise in bare metal.

50
00:03:25,869 --> 00:03:30,489
we've had specific expertise using
blockchain and digital chain of custody

51
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:36,290
applications, not so much, payment or
crypto, but using blockchains to do other,

52
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,470
kinds of supply chain oriented things.

53
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,980
And then.

54
00:03:39,725 --> 00:03:43,655
we've implemented these kinds of
solutions altogether to create product

55
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:46,144
frameworks that we use with clients.

56
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:53,145
So this chart gets us to, the blend of
my career and the world at large around,

57
00:03:53,215 --> 00:03:55,755
customer success and, and how you.

58
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,830
Drive different kinds
of customer experiences.

59
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:05,200
So I started out in live call centers
in the nineties and, specifically for

60
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,650
telecoms focused on sales and service.

61
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,800
in the two thousands I worked on, as I
said before, one of the largest BPOs of.

62
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,790
Of customer experience management.

63
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,400
And this involved, broadband technical
service for, technical support

64
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,850
for, one of the largest telecoms.

65
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,780
And in that environment, we were,
I was working in seven countries.

66
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,990
And we had people also in the US
and we had people, spread out around

67
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:42,840
the world and we were trying to deal
with, keeping the unit cost down

68
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,510
through, broader scheduling across
multiple vendors in multiple countries.

69
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:53,515
And, a lot of tactics that, have
been upgraded over the years with

70
00:04:53,515 --> 00:04:57,895
the advent of machine learning and
ai, different kinds of AI solutions.

71
00:04:58,614 --> 00:05:05,724
So the first two, boxes on this chart,
really the focus was on, call routing.

72
00:05:05,814 --> 00:05:10,744
some work on, improving the
personalization of the experience

73
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:11,974
and routing around that.

74
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:18,769
a lot about scheduling and training,
because the difference between the

75
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:24,019
BPOs and the live call centers and the
web self-help was a huge difference.

76
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:28,689
the work I was doing at the time
was creating time, reducing costs

77
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:32,889
and creating time for web self-help
to be built and rolled out by,

78
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:34,299
by teams that I was working with.

79
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:41,569
web self-help was all about, getting
in the getting calls captured into a

80
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:47,379
process without a call center where,
the users could find answers to problems

81
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:54,749
that they, wanted to find and move on,
or use some kind of system that could

82
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:58,559
actually create some kind of settings
change or something like that would,

83
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:02,589
Enable the service to work better
for the client in one way or another.

84
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:11,099
So that kind of avoidance was an
enormous cost, savings for call centers.

85
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:15,359
It diverted, calls away in a very
large way, and it still does today.

86
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:20,759
So web self help, which has
become AI enhanced is now.

87
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:26,359
Essentially eliminating calls and
turning calls into other kinds of things.

88
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:32,329
And the AI and LLM addition to
that is just really taking it to

89
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:37,079
another level rather than have it be
structured and following a flow chart.

90
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:43,349
Now it's, it's derived by a chatbot or
some other kind of technology around,

91
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:49,529
that ai, which gives us many more points
of data to do things like scheduling

92
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:56,549
workloads or, understanding sentiment
or, some kind of call avoidance in,

93
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,169
in a multimodal way that, really is
designed to, to get the customer.

94
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:05,479
To a point where, they're
happy with the experience.

95
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:12,639
And, and this has been the last 40 years,
the last 30 for sure, is on this chart.

96
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:18,479
So the strengths and challenges of call
centers are pretty well understood,

97
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,369
but for the broader audience, The value
proposition of a call center is really

98
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:28,889
the personal touch, real time support
from the perspective of you're actually

99
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:34,129
talking to somebody who's working with a
system that is going to change something

100
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:38,989
for you, change settings, make a payment
happen, reverse a payment, whatever.

101
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:45,359
So the The value is real because
someone's there doing something for you.

102
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:48,349
that's your sense when you're
talking to someone on the phone.

103
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:52,330
The challenge is it's a
very high cost solution.

104
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:58,030
If it's, if your call center is handling
all kinds of calls, including calls that

105
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:03,830
could be avoided, the attrition is very
high and it's, very hard to deal with.

106
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,640
certain types of call centers
like collection call centers

107
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,980
are extremely high attrition.

108
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:16,740
and the issue here is that, as a
product manager, it's very hard

109
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,430
to use your call centers or,
it's the only way to deal with.

110
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:27,070
A customer encountering new features
that have been released into software or

111
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,200
SaaS or some kind of solution like that.

112
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:35,630
without some way of diverting calls that
relate to customers, especially those

113
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,800
dealing with a new service or a change
in service through a new feature being

114
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,620
released, the cost is extremely high.

115
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,370
The value is not as high
either because you've got.

116
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:51,260
Low value calls mixed with high
value calls, and that's what actually

117
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,030
causes the attrition in a call center.

118
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,320
Nobody wants to do that work.

119
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,830
The era of AI has different
opportunities and challenges.

120
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:04,310
AI takes away some of these issues we
just discussed around call centers, mainly

121
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,530
by diverting it away from the call, but.

122
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:15,480
Also assisting or helping the agent be
better informed, doing the right thing,

123
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,910
and using AI to get that to happen.

124
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:22,600
So it creates scalability, interactions
become more cost effective.

125
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,790
The flip side is the technology
implementation costs.

126
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,360
the training of models to be
effective and not misleading or

127
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,330
provide misinformation and the
management of trust of that situation.

128
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:43,450
So, customers are not, I'm sure some
are unaware that they're working

129
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:48,400
with ai, but customers are not blind
to the what's happening, so they

130
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,300
need to feel like these are the
right answers that they're getting.

131
00:09:53,155 --> 00:09:57,985
the idea that they could be ideas
that adapt based on who the person

132
00:09:58,035 --> 00:10:02,835
is exciting at some level, but it
also means it's not deterministic.

133
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,835
In other words, the answer is
not the same for every customer.

134
00:10:06,795 --> 00:10:12,375
So that leads to trust, issues
that have to be like focused on,

135
00:10:12,885 --> 00:10:15,645
and mainly, what that means is.

136
00:10:16,455 --> 00:10:20,525
In the end, even though the
message might be different, this,

137
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,590
the problem needs to be resolved.

138
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,270
The issue needs to be resolved.

139
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,700
And if it is, then the trust goes up.

140
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:35,130
So what's the role of AI and the
transformation of CX to be this way?

141
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,360
so here's a few of the things that
we're gonna go through in more detail.

142
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,810
personalized customer
interactions, proactive resolution.

143
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,080
These two are really the, the holy grail.

144
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,570
This is what we're all after, right?

145
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,990
If we can create an interaction that
is specific to the, the consumer's

146
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:02,680
problem, if we can get in front of it
and use some kind of mode other than

147
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,440
a call center to actually deliver.

148
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,900
an issue resolution or inform
someone of a problem that they

149
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,420
may have and how to resolve it.

150
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:18,730
These are really, this is
the, all the value we want

151
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,490
from the customer experience.

152
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,490
enhancing self-help.

153
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:30,010
Is a huge opportunity, and making it
adapted to the customer based on their

154
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,350
skill level with technology and so forth.

155
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,660
These are all things that are
possible, and, being done at some

156
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,040
level by different companies.

157
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:44,780
efficient resource allocation is an area
as well, and sentiment analysis has been

158
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,930
upgraded through the latest AI technology.

159
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,570
So let's take it apart.

160
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,320
personalized interactions.

161
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:57,100
mainly what we're talking about here is
chat bots, that people get a response

162
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,890
from based on their question, which
makes it a personalized interaction.

163
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:03,290
it.

164
00:12:03,935 --> 00:12:09,235
It's able to be used as well by
support, by the actual call center

165
00:12:09,235 --> 00:12:14,425
agents, so it gets to faster
resolution for their clients, right?

166
00:12:14,425 --> 00:12:16,735
If they can see what they've done and.

167
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,850
They understand what they've
been shown and the problem was

168
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,080
figured out properly, then you can
accelerate the whole process here.

169
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:30,900
so the chat bots, as we discussed
before, they avoid call volume, right?

170
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,100
So there, it's an avoidance
strategy, which is, has been a good

171
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,920
one in general for, many decades.

172
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,020
So the opportunity here is to really.

173
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,540
Supercharge again, the whole experience
around virtual assistants and chat

174
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:51,630
bots, and it's got a lower cost, and
it delivers a personalized experience.

175
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:56,490
So all around it's, this is why all
this excitement exists in this area.

176
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:01,620
From a perspective of proactive issue,
re resolution, what we're talking about

177
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,210
is detecting patterns to prevent customer
complaints, to actually get in the way

178
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:12,210
of an escalation and stop it before it
starts by being proactive in an outreach.

179
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,200
An outreach that doesn't have to
be a phone call, but it could be.

180
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,310
in the right situation, that
might be the choice, but

181
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,350
generally the, this is multimodal.

182
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:27,150
So it could be text or some email or
some other method that gets, issue

183
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,370
escalation stop before it starts.

184
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:33,560
So this is an area of, Prediction, right?

185
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:39,730
So predict prediction of potential
service failures based on reviews

186
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,870
of calls coming in and, finding like
backtracking to some kind of bug

187
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:50,500
that's been released or, and in other
cases just avoiding a certain kind of

188
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:56,060
configuration which causes problems,
competing configurations in software.

189
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:01,650
So predicting these service failures
based on, customer experience interactions

190
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:06,880
and what's going on with your software
solution, for example, is a way that,

191
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,220
that this technology is applied here.

192
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:15,020
alerting businesses, before
customer escalate is a goal here.

193
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,280
and reducing negative experiences.

194
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,000
So the other area here
is, enhanced self-help.

195
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:26,480
So what we're talking about is going
from, the web health that started to

196
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,480
emerge in the 2010s to where we are today.

197
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:34,070
And the last, decade or so is the
application of, machine learning

198
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,720
to find patterns and then.

199
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:44,640
More recently chatbot to create,
dynamic FAQs, dynamic responses to, that

200
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:50,310
are designed to be aligned with, the
skill level of the, consumer involved,

201
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:56,160
continuous updates based on other queries
that customers are making, which indicate

202
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,440
some kind of pattern, like an outage or,
Some other kind of problem that's emerged

203
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,615
as part of a new feature or something.

204
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:09,455
So AI powered Certs is designed
to improve the efficiency.

205
00:15:09,915 --> 00:15:15,171
it's going to look across a larger set of
data points and basically pull together.

206
00:15:15,721 --> 00:15:20,371
based on all of that, including the most
recent information, what's going on, and

207
00:15:20,371 --> 00:15:22,981
try to deliver a more efficient solution.

208
00:15:23,611 --> 00:15:27,961
And it reduces the need for
human agents at some level.

209
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:32,031
human agents are gonna be informed
by this technology as well.

210
00:15:32,221 --> 00:15:36,511
although this topic isn't specifically
about the agents, and there's another

211
00:15:36,511 --> 00:15:38,941
topic about that, this is how.

212
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:42,351
They'll become more efficient
if they get on a call.

213
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:47,491
efficient resource allocation is
something that's enhanced by the,

214
00:15:48,101 --> 00:15:52,871
increased number of data points
that, the latest AI can look at.

215
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:58,351
There's been a lot of work for
decades on scheduling efficiency

216
00:15:58,981 --> 00:16:05,921
and, that kind of baseline backend
process is pretty stable right now.

217
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:10,121
What's the input to that
is really what's changing.

218
00:16:10,171 --> 00:16:15,381
chat bots and other kinds of technology
that are more AI and machine learning

219
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:20,721
oriented are able to figure out new
patterns and lay those on top of

220
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:25,651
existing ways of, Displaying scheduling
information and figuring out, peak

221
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:32,351
support times and figuring out routes and
inquiries, and generally leading to better

222
00:16:32,351 --> 00:16:35,391
balance of workload in the call center.

223
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:40,051
And I think, some of this, again, from
product management's perspective is

224
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:45,691
including in your data that you're looking
at, New features that have been deployed,

225
00:16:46,141 --> 00:16:50,421
new features that have been pulled back
in a continuous delivery environment

226
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:55,831
where you can see maybe there was an in,
there were calls coming in on something

227
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:57,901
and then it was pulled back, right?

228
00:16:58,081 --> 00:17:03,721
Something was like being tested and
some type of AB testing and, maybe

229
00:17:03,721 --> 00:17:05,491
there were a group of failures.

230
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,001
So.

231
00:17:06,866 --> 00:17:10,256
the new AI technologies are
able to consider those and

232
00:17:10,256 --> 00:17:12,016
then, wait, the response.

233
00:17:12,506 --> 00:17:17,416
and from a product management perspective,
you're going to probably want to have,

234
00:17:17,626 --> 00:17:24,166
the customer experience that's handled
by the AI to be influenced by what you're

235
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,866
doing as far as releasing new features.

236
00:17:27,366 --> 00:17:31,416
So workforce optimization, as I had
mentioned before, it's an area that's

237
00:17:31,656 --> 00:17:35,976
received tons of investment and
there are numbers of companies that

238
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:38,016
are very good at this kind of work.

239
00:17:38,076 --> 00:17:42,506
And now AI is being blended
in at a significant pace.

240
00:17:42,506 --> 00:17:45,626
They're basically see
themselves as AI companies.

241
00:17:45,626 --> 00:17:51,606
Now from an CX perspective, But generally
the goal here is to reduce operational

242
00:17:51,606 --> 00:17:59,586
costs, to flex calls and have workforces
optimized to not only take calls from

243
00:17:59,586 --> 00:18:07,076
customers, but also, in some environments
play a role as, reinforcement learner,

244
00:18:07,116 --> 00:18:11,616
people that are focused on grading
and reinforcing learning from the ai.

245
00:18:12,046 --> 00:18:14,176
these are some of the biggest experts.

246
00:18:14,776 --> 00:18:18,166
That exist in these companies as
far as how things should operate.

247
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:24,956
So looking at, proposed AI responses and
grading them is, a realistic role for

248
00:18:24,956 --> 00:18:27,296
the call center to play, in my opinion.

249
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:31,676
And this is the way that you get
them involved in reducing calls that

250
00:18:31,676 --> 00:18:36,746
they don't need to take, where the
answers are somewhat deterministic

251
00:18:36,746 --> 00:18:40,076
and you can get to something that
will solve people's problems.

252
00:18:40,576 --> 00:18:44,566
Sentiment analysis is another area
that's had tons of investment already.

253
00:18:45,256 --> 00:18:51,446
and AI is just a new enhancement as it
gets to a place where, more can be done.

254
00:18:51,626 --> 00:18:58,946
So in the NLP area where you're
actually listening to calls with ai,

255
00:18:59,396 --> 00:19:04,316
which has been going on for some time,
the improvements are substantial.

256
00:19:04,816 --> 00:19:10,516
And the opportunity to figure out tone
and sentiment, not just in calls with

257
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:17,926
NFP, but also analyzing text, and text
responses and chat bots is something

258
00:19:17,926 --> 00:19:21,826
that is key to avoiding frustration.

259
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:24,866
here's a couple of case studies.

260
00:19:24,926 --> 00:19:28,976
This one is actually one in which
I worked, that I mentioned before.

261
00:19:29,546 --> 00:19:35,026
And, this is a very large, technical
support, set of call centers and,

262
00:19:35,126 --> 00:19:40,866
actually web self-help and some
chat, that was, deployed to basically

263
00:19:40,866 --> 00:19:42,846
deal with problems with broadband.

264
00:19:43,821 --> 00:19:48,081
what was interesting for me about
this particular experience is when it

265
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:51,901
started, this was, an engagement I was
involved with for about five, six years.

266
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:58,351
when it started, the early, we were still
into the early adopters, and those were

267
00:19:58,351 --> 00:20:02,991
mainly technical pe people that understood
the technology at some level, not people

268
00:20:02,991 --> 00:20:05,631
that, were afraid of the technology or.

269
00:20:06,621 --> 00:20:07,761
Didn't even buy it.

270
00:20:07,761 --> 00:20:09,066
Someone else bought it for 'em.

271
00:20:09,351 --> 00:20:13,551
So as time went on though,
that's who we started to serve.

272
00:20:13,611 --> 00:20:18,601
So a, a very common thing that you
see in call centers is that as you

273
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:22,891
bring up a new service or a new
technology, or as you introduce new

274
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:28,891
features, you as a product manager,
you end up with situations where call

275
00:20:28,891 --> 00:20:31,681
center satisfaction goes down because.

276
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:36,481
The problems aren't well understood
that they're gonna have to be solved.

277
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:40,201
And then there's a little bit of
adjustment that has to happen.

278
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:45,721
AI dramatically speeds that up enormously.

279
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:52,021
So the call avoidance is very
high in those spaces, like telecom

280
00:20:52,141 --> 00:20:53,671
because a lot of it's technical.

281
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:58,951
There's only a few ways to do something,
so it's relatively deterministic.

282
00:20:59,536 --> 00:21:04,726
And the opportunity here is substantial,
as with this particular company.

283
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:10,246
this is talking really about their
last five years or so, five to 10.

284
00:21:10,846 --> 00:21:16,436
And, they've had major reductions of
basic call volume, really beginning in

285
00:21:17,216 --> 00:21:21,226
the, two thousands and early two 2010s.

286
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:27,241
And now they're just getting farther and
farther into eliminating call volume.

287
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:33,241
So where they were thousands of agents
in let's say tier two and tier one.

288
00:21:33,901 --> 00:21:36,571
now that's been reduced substantially.

289
00:21:37,246 --> 00:21:43,046
And my ex, my expectation it would
be that the cost of individual agents

290
00:21:43,046 --> 00:21:46,646
has gone up, but the specialization
that they do and the value that

291
00:21:46,646 --> 00:21:48,506
they create has gone up as well.

292
00:21:48,686 --> 00:21:55,046
And they, they can target very carefully
who needs to talk to an agent and at

293
00:21:55,046 --> 00:22:00,716
the same time have good exit paths
from their, process so that if someone

294
00:22:00,716 --> 00:22:03,506
needs to escalate out 'cause they
don't understand what's going on or.

295
00:22:04,466 --> 00:22:08,276
The chatbot doesn't, has never seen
their problem before 'cause it's new.

296
00:22:08,756 --> 00:22:13,326
those kind of exit paths are easy
to get, put in place and just

297
00:22:13,326 --> 00:22:15,426
generally faster issue resolution.

298
00:22:15,526 --> 00:22:19,576
in, in this environment, in the telecom
environment, especially broadband where

299
00:22:19,576 --> 00:22:24,616
you're talking about configuring a
router to, to some extent, in the past

300
00:22:24,616 --> 00:22:26,686
it was much more detailed than it is now.

301
00:22:27,286 --> 00:22:28,576
getting off the phone.

302
00:22:29,271 --> 00:22:32,211
was very difficult, but there
was just a lot to tie down.

303
00:22:32,211 --> 00:22:37,441
So the opportunities with AI are
really resolved as offline, not

304
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:42,361
in a call, in an actual call or
something, and drive a big, a faster

305
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,251
resolution, which is what people want.

306
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:50,081
another that is, I've experienced
more as a consumer than an operator

307
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:52,521
is, proactive call rebooking.

308
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:58,881
When a flight gets canceled or it's
late or whatever, this is truly

309
00:22:58,881 --> 00:23:03,771
where everyone wants to get to as
far as the ability to find ways to

310
00:23:03,801 --> 00:23:06,531
avoid a call and resolve a situation.

311
00:23:06,951 --> 00:23:08,632
through technology,
there's nothing better.

312
00:23:09,426 --> 00:23:11,766
This is the kind of the highest value.

313
00:23:11,976 --> 00:23:15,546
So while reducing call
volume is a great thing.

314
00:23:15,906 --> 00:23:18,096
essentially avoiding it through ai.

315
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:23,306
What would be even better is to resolve
the problem before, the customer has to

316
00:23:24,266 --> 00:23:29,246
deal with it, because that frustration
is gonna be what causes churn.

317
00:23:29,246 --> 00:23:32,876
Or in this case, somebody
choosing one airline or another

318
00:23:32,876 --> 00:23:36,536
in the future, banks have also.

319
00:23:36,926 --> 00:23:41,786
Had a kind of experience that
is similar in some respects to

320
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:43,346
the previous two, but different.

321
00:23:43,746 --> 00:23:47,496
this first line AI assistant
handled 1 billion plus interactions.

322
00:23:48,096 --> 00:23:52,236
It's extremely unlikely that those 1
billion interactions would've occurred.

323
00:23:52,736 --> 00:23:59,736
Without, online web self-help or
chat bots or something else, right?

324
00:23:59,886 --> 00:24:00,606
No one would.

325
00:24:01,326 --> 00:24:04,296
It's unlikely that people would
check their balances often.

326
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:08,876
It's unlikely that, people would have
interactions with their individual

327
00:24:08,876 --> 00:24:14,416
transactions as much as they do
now without AI and chat bots.

328
00:24:14,506 --> 00:24:16,336
So this is actually.

329
00:24:16,836 --> 00:24:22,746
An example of increasing, satisfaction of
customers and along with that, increasing

330
00:24:22,746 --> 00:24:28,206
the volume of interactions, but dealing
with them in a low cost multimodal way.

331
00:24:28,876 --> 00:24:34,366
30% call re reduction is on what
they had coming inbound on calls.

332
00:24:34,366 --> 00:24:37,456
So they still get that big
lift that you saw in telecom.

333
00:24:38,296 --> 00:24:44,026
and then they have this additional,
Volume, which is all customer,

334
00:24:44,076 --> 00:24:48,626
success that is focused on how
the people use the service.

335
00:24:48,686 --> 00:24:52,436
So improved high value service
interactions, really the result.

336
00:24:52,936 --> 00:24:57,016
So here are a few of the metrics
that you want to, be tracking.

337
00:24:57,206 --> 00:25:00,326
if you're not measuring it, you're not
gonna be able to do anything about it.

338
00:25:00,326 --> 00:25:00,746
So.

339
00:25:01,706 --> 00:25:06,836
what's new here is really AI deflection
rate, first call resolution and

340
00:25:06,836 --> 00:25:08,936
CSAT have been in place for decades.

341
00:25:09,726 --> 00:25:16,996
agent retention has been also measured o
obviously, for especially, large ca call

342
00:25:16,996 --> 00:25:19,546
center ops or operations with outsourcing.

343
00:25:19,906 --> 00:25:24,256
The cost of retraining and bringing
agents online is super high.

344
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:27,196
So whether you were a call
center outsourcer, or.

345
00:25:27,696 --> 00:25:30,806
The owner of the call
center, both time, both ways.

346
00:25:30,836 --> 00:25:33,246
This was a big focus.

347
00:25:33,746 --> 00:25:39,211
Satisfaction of agents is also
something to be monitored here, in my

348
00:25:39,211 --> 00:25:44,751
opinion, because I think that you're
gonna end up with learnings from that.

349
00:25:44,881 --> 00:25:48,461
That are gonna show you where
you're, where you need to tighten

350
00:25:48,461 --> 00:25:50,441
up on communication and so forth.

351
00:25:50,441 --> 00:25:55,041
Like what you're communicating,
coming out of, software development,

352
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:57,591
for example, and into production.

353
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:01,791
How you're communicating that and what
the training is associated with that.

354
00:26:02,091 --> 00:26:05,961
A lot of that is, is hard to
understand unless you're looking

355
00:26:05,961 --> 00:26:07,671
at satisfaction of agents.

356
00:26:08,171 --> 00:26:15,551
As we look forward to AI being included
into our operations and figuring out ways

357
00:26:15,551 --> 00:26:20,751
to do some of the big value prop, prop,
big value propositions, how we're going

358
00:26:20,751 --> 00:26:26,551
to, proactively get involved in resolving
problems and other things like that.

359
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:28,771
You wanna start with something small as.

360
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,051
is always advised pretty
much in all technology.

361
00:26:32,051 --> 00:26:39,251
So start with a small project that's gonna
have measurable value so that you can

362
00:26:39,251 --> 00:26:41,261
actually see some kind of improvement.

363
00:26:41,721 --> 00:26:46,881
ensure that you have human escalation
paths well figured out, especially if

364
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:51,151
you're going to do something that's
got, potentially lots of steps involved.

365
00:26:51,511 --> 00:26:55,051
anything like that ensure that
you've got a way to jump out of the

366
00:26:55,051 --> 00:27:01,311
process, because what you'll be able
to see is where the process is weak,

367
00:27:01,641 --> 00:27:06,751
depending on where people jump out
and, maybe where it has to be enhanced.

368
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:13,701
So if you provide good escalation paths
out, then you won't have people hang up.

369
00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:15,571
For example, mid.

370
00:27:16,186 --> 00:27:21,376
Mid interaction or kill the text
in the chat bot, what you'll see

371
00:27:21,376 --> 00:27:28,936
is where the problems got too
complicated and the user was not able

372
00:27:28,936 --> 00:27:30,736
to get the answer that they wanted.

373
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:35,316
So escalation paths out of the
process that you're trying to

374
00:27:35,316 --> 00:27:36,976
implement is pretty important.

375
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:42,196
And then just focus on feedback, which is
also hard to get, which is why you want

376
00:27:42,196 --> 00:27:44,656
to focus on these human escalation paths.

377
00:27:45,156 --> 00:27:49,926
What comes out of those human
conversations with people about like

378
00:27:50,406 --> 00:27:55,531
why they couldn't get it to work is
gonna be much more easy to pull out

379
00:27:55,986 --> 00:28:00,036
then, even though it's anecdotal,
then real world feedback where

380
00:28:00,036 --> 00:28:02,156
people are doing, survey responses.

381
00:28:02,656 --> 00:28:05,176
So pretty typical red map here.

382
00:28:05,676 --> 00:28:11,436
The focus here is just that this is a
technology deployment and even if you

383
00:28:11,436 --> 00:28:18,161
buy a third party service, you need
to follow, a reasonable path here.

384
00:28:18,341 --> 00:28:23,861
So that you don't create, paths within
your customer experience management that

385
00:28:23,861 --> 00:28:29,761
are half finished and unable to really
deal with the problems that are going on.

386
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:35,881
So a lot of monitoring of chatbots,
for example, a lot of, reinforcement

387
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:41,491
learning going on with your agents is only
gonna help move this along because it.

388
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:47,651
Where AI differs a little bit is that
you are, you're managing the growth

389
00:28:48,401 --> 00:28:52,991
of a model and a knowledge base of
a model and the true ups of a model.

390
00:28:52,991 --> 00:28:58,171
it's a different kind of iterative,
almost research oriented work.

391
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:04,161
So the more data that they can get during
the early phases, is pretty critical.

392
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:07,401
And then as it gets into production.

393
00:29:08,286 --> 00:29:12,756
You need to be focused on getting
feedback both from escalations as well

394
00:29:12,756 --> 00:29:15,216
as after action feedback from a survey.

395
00:29:15,716 --> 00:29:19,526
So what's the future of
where all this is going?

396
00:29:19,956 --> 00:29:25,296
AI plus some kind of hybrid
human service where a person

397
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:27,546
can jump into a call based on.

398
00:29:28,236 --> 00:29:34,556
Priority or, re relative to, product
management that's going on, like

399
00:29:34,556 --> 00:29:38,936
new features getting released,
tying those more tightly together.

400
00:29:39,566 --> 00:29:41,066
That's pretty much the future.

401
00:29:41,276 --> 00:29:45,541
doing things in multiple modes has
been happening for decades as well,

402
00:29:45,801 --> 00:29:47,786
and that's only gonna continue.

403
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:51,826
And then really the focus, the
opportunity is predictive and

404
00:29:51,826 --> 00:29:53,596
proactive customer support.

405
00:29:54,096 --> 00:29:59,586
So as some takeaways, I would
say generally that AI is not

406
00:29:59,586 --> 00:30:04,086
in a place where it's designed
to replace human interactions.

407
00:30:04,896 --> 00:30:07,236
AI is here to help enhance them.

408
00:30:07,926 --> 00:30:12,696
so you know, where we can replace
human interactions is where we've

409
00:30:12,696 --> 00:30:14,736
been replacing human interactions.

410
00:30:14,736 --> 00:30:16,206
So basic call volume.

411
00:30:16,836 --> 00:30:20,916
questions that have very
deterministic outcomes, right?

412
00:30:20,916 --> 00:30:23,016
So they're always the
same answer every time.

413
00:30:23,316 --> 00:30:26,436
Tho those are gonna be the
places where we're gonna get call

414
00:30:26,436 --> 00:30:28,596
avoidance and they always have been.

415
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:34,096
So the opportunity here is to really
focus on that with the new technologies.

416
00:30:34,096 --> 00:30:39,756
But it's not gonna eliminate
call centers 100% unless your

417
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:42,816
business is that deterministic.

418
00:30:43,236 --> 00:30:46,866
Right where there's complexity,
you're gonna need people.

419
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:53,086
And without those people you risk
losing high value, customer interactions

420
00:30:53,086 --> 00:30:54,766
or even losing the customer.

421
00:30:55,586 --> 00:31:00,526
AI is going to help improve efficiency
and satisfaction to customers.

422
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:04,516
So that's what you should be
looking for and measuring.

423
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:12,106
And product managers need to more tightly
integrate what's going on in product

424
00:31:12,106 --> 00:31:15,976
management to this CX environment.

425
00:31:16,216 --> 00:31:22,026
There has to be a very tight integration
so that if people are reporting problems,

426
00:31:22,806 --> 00:31:29,316
that it becomes very clear to the product
managers as quickly as possible what those

427
00:31:29,316 --> 00:31:31,266
issues are that they're encountering.

428
00:31:31,971 --> 00:31:34,911
And almost in real time you
should be looking at it.

429
00:31:35,301 --> 00:31:42,271
so even if your product is, has a high
touch deployment with the clients,

430
00:31:42,671 --> 00:31:46,511
and you get feedback from those kind
of deployments and installations,

431
00:31:46,511 --> 00:31:51,081
at least the early ones, you, as
you get into more of a steady state

432
00:31:51,081 --> 00:31:53,061
and you're changing features out.

433
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:58,776
Releasing new features, you really
need to be tied together with your CX

434
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:03,906
and you should expect that you can get
these kind of responses from it, which

435
00:32:03,906 --> 00:32:08,286
are gonna be super valuable for product
management and overall customer success.
