1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,780
Speaker 4: Hello, my name is Alex Kin.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:09,110
I've been working in information
technology over 20 years, across wide

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,820
range of projects from engineering
roles to executive leadership.

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,980
Currently I am a CEO
of deep teach startup.

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:24,200
And today I want to talk about
next generation of AI agents.

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,390
What can we see behind current hype?

7
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:30,195
And where is current frontier?

8
00:00:30,695 --> 00:00:36,185
Okay, let's get to presentation
Next Generation AI agents.

9
00:00:36,395 --> 00:00:43,115
Quite ambitious topic, but my goal is
to bring to attention something from

10
00:00:43,195 --> 00:00:50,695
scientific and research frontier and
show you it as a quite deep rabbit hole.

11
00:00:51,195 --> 00:00:57,935
And if you like some you could have
a lot of fun building some knowledge

12
00:00:57,995 --> 00:01:02,455
around it and possibly some basic
solution solutions or something.

13
00:01:02,955 --> 00:01:09,615
So in this presentation, we will go
over some consideration of current

14
00:01:09,615 --> 00:01:12,135
situation with AI agents in terms of.

15
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:20,840
Hyper facing, but how it's connected to
reality, trying to see connections to

16
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:28,910
next generation agents for building on
first principles and active inference as

17
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:37,535
a theory, as a framework which is based
on physics, biology, and our sciences.

18
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:45,665
How it is possible to build single legends
and then some kind of nested systems and

19
00:01:45,665 --> 00:01:51,785
how it is possible to see it as a stepping
stone for participation in technological

20
00:01:51,785 --> 00:01:58,835
evolution gain, starting from first
principles and physics, maths, and so on.

21
00:01:59,335 --> 00:01:59,665
Yeah.

22
00:01:59,665 --> 00:02:05,425
As for current situation, last year
was definitely a year of the agent in

23
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:08,925
terms of new developments and hype.

24
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:12,035
What was raised around even through.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,929
Few months of this year, we see a
lot of new projects and some crazy

26
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:25,029
ones and see even shortage in Mac
Minis, which is used to launch for

27
00:02:25,029 --> 00:02:27,339
log agent solutions for people.

28
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:30,420
And developers and builders.

29
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:38,060
But all of 'em still based on LLM
approaches generative AI approaches.

30
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:44,590
We promise Autonom, autonomous
and multi and team work working

31
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,270
on complex tasks and, use cases
that we are showing currently.

32
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,650
Foil, massive excitement.

33
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,840
Excitement, but actually
we're still waiting for some

34
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,480
real solution, which will.

35
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:05,120
Be in our everyday life following
that market booming and for,

36
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,685
again, for last year, it's already
around $8 billion and fast growth

37
00:03:10,715 --> 00:03:14,225
expected to 50 billions by 2030.

38
00:03:14,725 --> 00:03:20,185
Driving by enterprise automation demands
and working in with industry and so on.

39
00:03:20,685 --> 00:03:23,685
But getting to some relative check.

40
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:27,445
Such agents still fail in novel scenarios.

41
00:03:28,235 --> 00:03:34,935
We still data very data and
compute hungry and we still ate.

42
00:03:35,045 --> 00:03:39,425
And we know how it goes when you
get to some something complex.

43
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:44,455
And more and more complexity,
getting more and more downfalls

44
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:47,144
of approach in terms of project.

45
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:53,084
How currently started just
through this year, up to 70%.

46
00:03:53,084 --> 00:03:58,904
So them have risks to stop working because
of unexpected costs scaling complex

47
00:03:59,054 --> 00:04:01,604
complexity and other related risks.

48
00:04:02,104 --> 00:04:09,024
And it shows together a huge gap between
that hype and actually through autonomy,

49
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:12,154
through agency and while promising.

50
00:04:12,154 --> 00:04:18,849
Most agents still like, adaptability
still like working with Istic motivation

51
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:26,104
and with GI that certain opportunities
for building next generation solutions.

52
00:04:26,205 --> 00:04:31,734
And for this presentation, I show
information specifically about active

53
00:04:31,734 --> 00:04:39,029
inference as an example of such first
principle framework and let's get there.

54
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:46,419
Yeah, some basics about active inference
from that first principle consideration.

55
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,339
It's as a theory.

56
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:54,129
It's based and routed in free energy
principle and theory, which is developed

57
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:58,529
by Carl Tristan most ci neuro scientist.

58
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:04,469
And it's pos that adaptive systems
have some interesting capability to

59
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:11,089
minimize surprise or prediction error
to will survive in entropy world.

60
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:15,955
And you build it with unification
on biology and physics.

61
00:05:16,455 --> 00:05:19,364
And application to
artificial intelligence.

62
00:05:20,205 --> 00:05:26,755
The core idea of approach that agents
reduce variational free energy or bound

63
00:05:26,905 --> 00:05:34,674
surprise as some metrics intrinsic
metrics which shows how different model

64
00:05:34,674 --> 00:05:40,604
of the world of the agent and actually
the world and through perception.

65
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:48,160
And updating internal world models of the
agent and through actions when changing

66
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,860
for world around is also possible.

67
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,520
So that action piece is very
important, not just inference and

68
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,200
updating the models about updating
actual world around according to one.

69
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:07,480
Yeah, and it brings specific
action perception loop.

70
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:13,060
And actually action and perception
could be considered a same

71
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,150
phenomenon in this approach.

72
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:21,760
And for sensing the data agent
can infer some hiding causes.

73
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:27,535
And update its beliefs on it,
and then act to refine models

74
00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:29,965
or environment accordingly.

75
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:35,475
And learning from outcomes creating
continuous adaptation for himself.

76
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:41,305
So expected free energy is
also the metric which includes

77
00:06:41,305 --> 00:06:43,465
consideration for epistemic value.

78
00:06:43,965 --> 00:06:50,955
To explore exploration to reduce
uncertainty for the agent and

79
00:06:50,955 --> 00:06:56,155
getting pragmatic values based
on given generative models.

80
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:01,710
So exploitation phase to achieve
some preferred states of the agent.

81
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:08,480
And why it's matter for building of
artificial inte, inte intelligence agents.

82
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:15,100
Its can provide interesting motivation
for the agent and build it very efficient

83
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:24,280
way unlike our current approaches and it's
enables draw autonomy in for changing and

84
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,940
uncertain environments for such agents.

85
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:35,725
And they can evolve through the time built
on first principles from active inference.

86
00:07:36,225 --> 00:07:36,465
Yeah.

87
00:07:36,465 --> 00:07:42,225
So free energy principles defines
that all adaptive systems minimize

88
00:07:42,225 --> 00:07:44,320
free energy rational free energy.

89
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:50,970
Or surprise and it's physical, like a
physical principle for adaptive systems.

90
00:07:51,585 --> 00:07:55,695
Active influence is a theory
or a framework, build it on it.

91
00:07:56,455 --> 00:08:02,855
And is defines that agents actively
samples the world around to refine

92
00:08:02,855 --> 00:08:09,795
where generative models and for we unify
processes of perception, actions, and

93
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:15,115
learning to be adaptive in an environment
through agent loop, which defining.

94
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:22,825
Some different states for agent and
environment in some informational symmetry

95
00:08:23,815 --> 00:08:29,935
and loop of the agent on influence
states predicts outcomes of its actions

96
00:08:29,985 --> 00:08:36,895
selections, policies for specific actions
everything based on calculation for

97
00:08:36,925 --> 00:08:38,950
minimization of expected free energy.

98
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:46,370
And if building on that, we can
define agents and next generation

99
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:54,140
agents like autonomous entities
with a core of hierarchical active

100
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,470
inference over generative models,
which adaptive in the world.

101
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:03,580
And if we are ready to build on
that, we can get actually to enable

102
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:09,440
them through agency and build on
adaptation of such approaches and

103
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:15,425
build on interesting motivation of such
first principle agents in a new way.

104
00:09:15,925 --> 00:09:21,425
As for such agents, active inference
agents, advantages very adaptive.

105
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:28,845
They actually solved dilemma of
exploration exploitation and have

106
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:34,605
it in some dual mode of handling
uncertainty through epistemic

107
00:09:34,605 --> 00:09:37,295
for engine to reduce, yeah.

108
00:09:37,795 --> 00:09:44,120
And by that outperform current approaches
and get into option and capability

109
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,190
to work with novel scenarios without
massive training for the models.

110
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:54,800
As for interesting motivations way
build it on that biology principles

111
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:00,800
it's possible to get to, goal
seeking and curious behavior which

112
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,910
emerge from such first principles.

113
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:11,570
And it's different from current only
reward and reinforcement approaches.

114
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,780
Such engines could be work,
could work very efficient and

115
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,240
by what, be very scalable.

116
00:10:19,675 --> 00:10:24,235
And from scalability, it's also
possible to build a hierarchies of

117
00:10:24,285 --> 00:10:26,715
generative models for, of such agents.

118
00:10:27,345 --> 00:10:33,635
And we need quite low data and quite
load compute for learning which is

119
00:10:33,635 --> 00:10:38,855
again, contrast one from current
approaches and important thing about

120
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:41,855
explainability of such agent's behavior.

121
00:10:42,035 --> 00:10:43,445
And when governance software.

122
00:10:43,945 --> 00:10:44,695
Behavior.

123
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:51,145
Through that approach, it's possible to
have it inspectable about where beliefs

124
00:10:51,145 --> 00:10:54,625
of agents, about policies we're choosing.

125
00:10:55,495 --> 00:11:01,605
So it's reduced in risk risks
compared to current black box models

126
00:11:02,235 --> 00:11:04,900
is not understandable effects.

127
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:10,710
So active inference is a multi-scale
approach, and we can consider

128
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:18,120
building starting built in from single
agents to for scaling to multi-agent

129
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,600
environments and on the same principles.

130
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:27,265
And even on single scale
For agent, it will be.

131
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:35,260
Able to be real time adaptive and be able
to operate in uncertain environments.

132
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:43,300
With changes with novelty, and that's
important, for example, for robotics when

133
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:51,540
body control in changing environment still
quite huge problem and solving on that

134
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:59,040
scale, working together such agents can
share, the models of the world, keeping

135
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:05,820
their own boundaries as a mark of blankets
and building some nested structure with

136
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:12,145
belief propagation from message pacing
and working on expected free energy.

137
00:12:12,645 --> 00:12:17,925
Minimization for whole
team of agent and emerge.

138
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:22,605
Orchestration from that
collective behavior through

139
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:30,025
common world model without central
controllers is also possible.

140
00:12:30,525 --> 00:12:31,935
Achievement at some moment.

141
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:32,825
Yeah.

142
00:12:33,515 --> 00:12:38,635
Active inference can be considered
in a context of technological

143
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:44,875
evolution and like accelerating of
technological evolution because self

144
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:48,295
evolving agents can drive innovation.

145
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:50,630
We can work and enable.

146
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:56,905
Complex, intelligent by mirroring
biological and physical evolution

147
00:12:56,955 --> 00:13:03,275
mechanisms into digital world, we
can work through collective faster or

148
00:13:03,695 --> 00:13:10,235
discoveries working with hypothesis
in the same manner of epistemic or

149
00:13:10,235 --> 00:13:12,985
actions as biological agents are.

150
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:20,000
And this is refining model models
and working as researchers and create

151
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,740
some new ways of problem solving.

152
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:29,970
It is possible to build silent enterprise
system based on them because you could

153
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:36,940
have have a traceability of on what's
happening and that orchestrated structure

154
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,950
of multi-engine environment and workflows.

155
00:13:40,765 --> 00:13:44,635
Which are capable to adapt in real time.

156
00:13:45,135 --> 00:13:50,115
And using the same principle on
different scales through different

157
00:13:50,115 --> 00:13:55,925
parts of automation robotics
parts and supply chains and our

158
00:13:56,465 --> 00:13:58,690
activities of organizations.

159
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,670
And it's builds bridge to
systemic transformation.

160
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:11,780
And getting from isolated tasks for
ecosystem wide consideration and finding

161
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:19,610
some new business model, novel business
model by such agents, even possible social

162
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:26,590
structures and at some moment getting
to solve real global scale challenges.

163
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:32,460
Getting closer to the end and just
showing, yeah, that perspective

164
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,420
that behind the current hype it
is needed to trying to figure

165
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,640
out where is the next frontier.

166
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:47,355
And getting for whole AI movement gets
into first principles, approaches,

167
00:14:47,415 --> 00:14:50,595
implementation, and here specifically for.

168
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,690
Active inference for agents.

169
00:14:54,510 --> 00:15:01,850
I believe it's implementation of it could
really embrace through agency for such

170
00:15:01,915 --> 00:15:09,075
agents because of defining next generation
through first principles for agents which

171
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:17,125
minimize that free energy or surprise
and, able to be adaptive and be able to be

172
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:25,940
efficient and be able to solve problems of
current LLM approach, LM based approach.

173
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,350
Limitations.

174
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:34,030
Yeah, it is good to have in mind about
what active inference providing solution

175
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,360
for exploration exploitation, dilemma.

176
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:45,420
And it's leverage to create agents which
work with uncertainty by that microbiome

177
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:50,605
be able to operate in real world and
in dynamic change in environments.

178
00:15:51,105 --> 00:15:58,155
And such agent can work in hierarchical,
nested structure and arrange some

179
00:15:58,155 --> 00:16:00,695
multi-agent emergent behavior.

180
00:16:01,195 --> 00:16:07,620
And working as a single agent or teams
but with the same generative world models.

181
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,700
And doing the same in terms of
minimization of predictions and surprise

182
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,920
about the world and actions in that world.

183
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:24,630
And finally get to, need to get to some
specific actions in that rabbit hole

184
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:30,750
direction and trying to build next steps
and technological evolution we need.

185
00:16:30,795 --> 00:16:35,325
To start experimenting with the
new tools which are available.

186
00:16:35,985 --> 00:16:41,985
Some project are already and start
in place, and some startups getting

187
00:16:42,405 --> 00:16:48,315
financing and first robots work
on active inference frameworks.

188
00:16:49,035 --> 00:16:53,335
Let me to provide you
information about resources to

189
00:16:53,335 --> 00:16:56,365
get into Rabbit Hole and yeah.

190
00:16:56,415 --> 00:17:01,405
First is a textbook from
par Puzzle and Freestone.

191
00:17:02,035 --> 00:17:07,615
It's available in for free
on MIT resource by the link.

192
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,370
And you can start from there.

193
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:14,370
Next textbook, which will be
available soon on fundamentals

194
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:19,280
of Active Inference for finally
for engineers as, which is good.

195
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:27,305
Some libraries on Julia on Python
with examples of basic agents working

196
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:31,205
on active inference principles,
which you can start play with.

197
00:17:31,705 --> 00:17:37,335
And link to Active Influence Institute,
where you can get much more information

198
00:17:37,605 --> 00:17:43,425
about information sources, some activities
on collective education and so on.

199
00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:50,225
So if you interested in such approach,
go through links, start getting

200
00:17:50,225 --> 00:17:52,445
information, start possibly building.

201
00:17:52,945 --> 00:17:53,690
And if you.

202
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,020
Possibly have some questions.

203
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:02,390
You can reach me out through with QR
to LinkedIn and thank you for your

204
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:10,400
attention and hopefully we'll see some
new approaches and a new projects who are

205
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,850
building on something real from Frontier.
