00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,250
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:04,010
Today I'm excited to talk about
something that sits at the

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,720
center of every IOT ecosystem.

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:11,020
Messaging at scale as iot device is
multiply into the tens of billions,

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:15,760
the ability to move data reliably,
quickly, and intelligently becomes

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,935
one of the biggest engineering
challenges of the next decade.

7
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:22,665
This talk focuses on data driven
strategies for achieving low latency,

8
00:00:22,995 --> 00:00:28,064
high throughput, and strong operational
resilience, the three pillars needed to

9
00:00:28,064 --> 00:00:30,314
support real world iot systems at scale.

10
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:35,915
My name is Kate Ani, and I am a
software development engineer at AWS.

11
00:00:36,455 --> 00:00:40,085
I specialize in building distributed
systems, real time messaging

12
00:00:40,085 --> 00:00:42,215
platforms and IOT infrastructure.

13
00:00:42,815 --> 00:00:46,055
That must scale reliably under
extreme traffic conditions.

14
00:00:46,775 --> 00:00:50,465
Most of the insights I'm sharing today
come from P practical work, implementing

15
00:00:50,465 --> 00:00:54,695
high performance messaging pipelines
used in enterprise deployments.

16
00:00:55,195 --> 00:00:59,935
We all know iot is growing, but the
scale is often underestimated By

17
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:06,295
2025, IOT systems are projected to
generate 1 75 zetabytes of data.

18
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:08,515
There's an almost.

19
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,270
Unimaginable number.

20
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,910
IOT systems also demand sub hundred
millisecond latency for anything real time

21
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:21,400
autonomous vehicles, robotics, industrial
automation, or medical devices, right?

22
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,650
And beyond data volume, we are
looking at 1 million plus concurrent

23
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,180
device connections in even moderately
large deployments, smart cities,

24
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,400
industrial plants, logical networks.

25
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:38,360
This combination, massive data, strict
latency, millions of connections.

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,920
This creates a perfect storm
that traditional architecture

27
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,030
simply cannot handle.

28
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:48,755
We need a new way of
thinking about scaling here.

29
00:01:49,255 --> 00:01:52,945
Most traditional architectures today,
they rely on reactive scaling model.

30
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:58,265
Your traffic goes up, your metrics spike,
and then the system responds afterwards.

31
00:01:58,765 --> 00:02:00,175
But in iot, this doesn't work.

32
00:02:00,895 --> 00:02:05,844
We have latency demands, so responses must
stay under a hundred milliseconds, even

33
00:02:05,904 --> 00:02:10,769
across distributed regions, throughput
requirements, millions of messages per

34
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:13,409
second must be processed without backlog.

35
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:15,529
And then operational resilience.

36
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:21,019
Uptime must remain high even when
traffic surges or partial failures occur.

37
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:25,719
IOT requires precision,
proactive scaling and data driven

38
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,879
optimizations, not brute force.

39
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,939
Our approach today is organized
around a three pillar framework.

40
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:34,219
The first one is latency reduction.

41
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:38,869
So we want to use techniques like
multi-tier caching asynchronous

42
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:43,219
designs between microservices and
intelligent message prioritization.

43
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:46,149
The second one is throughput maximization.

44
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:51,059
This can be achieved with advanced
load balancing, predictive

45
00:02:51,059 --> 00:02:53,249
auto-scaling and q partitioning.

46
00:02:53,749 --> 00:02:56,539
And then the third one, that
is operational resilience.

47
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,169
It can be built through
continuous monitoring.

48
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:05,199
Anomaly detections and then machine
learning driven tuning these pillars

49
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,919
together provide a blueprint for
modern iot messaging pipelines.

50
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:12,929
To reduce latency across
billions of messages, you must

51
00:03:12,929 --> 00:03:14,249
remove friction at every step.

52
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:19,249
Multi-year caching at the
edge region and central layers

53
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:21,109
dramatically reduce lookup overhead.

54
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:23,949
You are asynchronous
event driven frameworks.

55
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:29,619
They can avoid blocking behaviors and
then keep message flows very smooth.

56
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:34,949
And then intelligent prioritization
ensures any urgent events like

57
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:40,109
actuator commands or safety
alerts that occur, they never wait

58
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:41,819
behind lower priority telemetry.

59
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,309
The, this strategy targets the
biggest cause of slowdowns that is

60
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,959
unnecessary waiting in the system.

61
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:52,409
The optimizations aren't theoretical
they are producing real outcomes.

62
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,649
So manufacturing, iot deployment,
predictive maintenance,

63
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:57,539
workloads, solut drop to catch.

64
00:03:57,944 --> 00:04:00,464
Failures be before downtime occurred.

65
00:04:00,944 --> 00:04:04,634
And then for smart city sensor
networks, infrastructure systems reached

66
00:04:04,634 --> 00:04:08,534
consistent sub millisecond processing
for traffic and environmental monitoring.

67
00:04:09,104 --> 00:04:13,394
And then we saw that for large scale
chat platforms, message delivery

68
00:04:13,394 --> 00:04:17,654
performance improved to near
instant, even at peak global volume.

69
00:04:18,154 --> 00:04:22,324
This example show how small
latency gains at the micro

70
00:04:22,324 --> 00:04:24,424
level become huge wins at scale.

71
00:04:24,924 --> 00:04:30,294
IOT systems can generate busty traffic
that's known it, they can send millions

72
00:04:30,294 --> 00:04:32,804
of messages in seconds to keep up.

73
00:04:32,864 --> 00:04:38,604
We have to focus on throughput and that
can be done via advanced load balancing.

74
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:43,544
So load balancing that chooses the best
nodes based on health and capacity.

75
00:04:44,044 --> 00:04:49,064
And then predictive autoscaling should
use machine learning today to prepare

76
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:51,224
for surgeries before they happen.

77
00:04:51,314 --> 00:04:55,634
So constant traffic analysis and
looking at patterns from previous

78
00:04:55,634 --> 00:04:57,404
days across the entire network.

79
00:04:57,904 --> 00:05:02,234
Then for q partitioning where messages
are separated by priority or destination

80
00:05:02,854 --> 00:05:04,144
to enable parallel processing.

81
00:05:04,644 --> 00:05:08,214
The idea is not just to scale,
but to scale intelligently.

82
00:05:08,714 --> 00:05:12,704
In real world iot systems,
traffic spikes are unavoidable.

83
00:05:13,394 --> 00:05:18,724
For example, think about firmware,
rollouts or sensor storms, or

84
00:05:18,724 --> 00:05:23,434
network reconnection events, or
just regular daily peak cycles.

85
00:05:23,934 --> 00:05:28,089
The architecture can withstand three
x traffic surges with zero downtime.

86
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:30,569
And what are the key
mechanisms to achieve that?

87
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:35,249
The first one is early horizontal
scaling before the limits are hit.

88
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:40,789
So if we do machine learning based
analysis of the system, and that

89
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:45,019
should alert your system or make
it capable enough to horizontally

90
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:46,969
scale before the actual event hits.

91
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:51,009
Circuit breakers should be placed
to prevent cascading failures.

92
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:55,019
And then intelligent message
buffering to avoid data loss.

93
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,539
This gives iot systems the resilience
needed for mission critical environments.

94
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:06,039
Operational resilience is the difference
between a minor issue and a majors outage.

95
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,329
Continuous monitoring tracks
performance metrics in real

96
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:11,309
time across all components.

97
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:16,509
And then anomaly detection should
help spot early warning signals

98
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:19,119
before users notice this degradation.

99
00:06:19,619 --> 00:06:23,669
And then ML driven tuning should
learn from past incidents and

100
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:26,249
optimize parameters automatically.

101
00:06:26,749 --> 00:06:32,544
A combination of these three
should help or should deliver.

102
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:39,579
99.9995% uptime, even in resource
constraint environments in iot

103
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:41,049
uptime isn't just a metric.

104
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:42,249
It is.

105
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:46,029
It directly impacts safety,
automation, and business continuity.

106
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:50,639
So assuming we implement all of the
measures that we just talked about,

107
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:52,459
what does the future look like?

108
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,734
We are entering a new era of
messaging optimization, powered by ai.

109
00:06:57,234 --> 00:07:00,414
We should be talking about
self-healing systems.

110
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:02,874
We should have AI agents.

111
00:07:03,804 --> 00:07:08,064
They should detect, diagnose, and
fix performance issues in real time

112
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:10,039
without any human intervention.

113
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:11,829
Edge computing integration.

114
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:16,509
Processing data closer to the
devices reduces latency significantly

115
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:20,389
rather than having network hops
across countries or continents.

116
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:23,529
And that should enable new
use cases for our customers.

117
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:26,369
And then sustainability
focused algorithms.

118
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:32,759
Modern systems can reduce energy
consumption by up to 30% while still

119
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,669
maintaining the high performance
that we expect from these systems.

120
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:42,019
The next generation of iot messaging
will be and should be autonomous,

121
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:43,819
distributed, and energy aware.

122
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,399
Through real world deployments we
see recurring architectural patterns

123
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,289
that consistently deliver results.

124
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:55,999
Event driven microservices for decoupled
independently scalable workflows, and

125
00:07:55,999 --> 00:08:01,729
then message brokers for clustering
of high availability and redundancy.

126
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:06,939
We should have regional failers for
geo resiliency and disaster scenarios.

127
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,769
And then protocol optimization,
especially within with MQ TT

128
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:14,019
and COP for constrain devices.

129
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:17,609
These design principles from
form the backbone of resilient

130
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,899
IOT messaging systems.

131
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:23,629
But then how do we manage or balance
optimization with complexity?

132
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:28,569
One important lesson that we learned is
optimization should always be balanced.

133
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:32,490
And then too much complexity
can cause fragility.

134
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,160
There are three guidelines.

135
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,010
Always start simple as with everything.

136
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,940
Implement one optimization at a
time, and then measure its actual

137
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,190
impact on the system and monitor it.

138
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,860
Monitor everything.

139
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,490
As I said, quality data
produces better decisions.

140
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,335
Wait for the data, let it
arrive and gather the data.

141
00:08:52,835 --> 00:08:54,875
And then you want to iterate continuously.

142
00:08:55,475 --> 00:08:57,875
You want to understand the
traffic patterns that evolve.

143
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:01,605
And then with the traffic
patterns that are evolving, your

144
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,255
optimizations should evolve.

145
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:08,105
The goal is sustainable
scalability, not over-engineering.

146
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:10,615
So let me wrap up with
three key takeaways.

147
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:12,825
First one is systematic frameworks.

148
00:09:13,325 --> 00:09:16,795
Outperform reactive scaling
data driven methods deliver

149
00:09:16,795 --> 00:09:19,225
predictable repeatable improvements.

150
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:24,305
Real world strategies already work
at enterprise scale, so caching,

151
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:27,965
predictive scaling, and machine
learning based monitoring consistently

152
00:09:28,385 --> 00:09:29,975
delivers better performance today.

153
00:09:30,475 --> 00:09:34,935
And then future ready
architectures integrate AI and

154
00:09:34,935 --> 00:09:37,535
edge computing, this combination.

155
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,410
Should enable efficient, resilient,
sustainable I ecosystems with ai.

156
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,940
This is the path forward for iot
messaging infrastructures that

157
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,790
truly scales it has to grow with ai.

158
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,200
And with that, thank you
all for joining the session.

159
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,130
I hope the strategies we discuss
give you a clearer path towards

160
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,250
building fast, reliable, and
scalable iot messaging systems.

161
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,480
Thank you for your time.
