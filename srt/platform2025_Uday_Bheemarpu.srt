1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,210
Hello and welcome to Con Session.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,160
My name is Pu and the topic of my
presentation is Beyond Native Automation,

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,560
how RPS Superchargers Salesforce.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,920
In this session we'll be discussing
how robotic process automation can be

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,510
integrated with Salesforce to achieve
seamless end-to-end process automation.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,270
We will examine the challenges enterprise
has faced in connecting diverse

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,020
systems, legacy systems, analyze the
strengths and limitations of Salesforce

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,305
native automation tools, study.

9
00:00:28,965 --> 00:00:33,405
And demonstrate how RPA Bridges
critical integration gaps, especially

10
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:37,334
these gaps will occur while we are
using any kind of legacy systems.

11
00:00:37,724 --> 00:00:41,025
This session will provide you with
a complete understanding of where

12
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:45,285
RPA adds value, how it works in
conjunction with Salesforce, and the

13
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:49,444
measurable business benefits that
results from this combined approach.

14
00:00:50,044 --> 00:00:53,629
So for today's agenda, we'll be discussing
about the integration challenges.

15
00:00:54,504 --> 00:00:58,734
Where we will outline the complexity of
modern enterprise technology ecosystem.

16
00:00:59,304 --> 00:01:02,455
Second, we'll discuss about the
native Salesforce limitations.

17
00:01:02,485 --> 00:01:06,475
We'll also discuss about what Salesforce
provides us and its limitations

18
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:09,955
identifying the specific scenarios
where data tools are not enough.

19
00:01:10,554 --> 00:01:15,175
Next, we'll be discussing about how
RPA can act as a bridge, which will

20
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:19,164
explain how RPA can overcome these
limitations that the Salesforce has.

21
00:01:19,945 --> 00:01:23,304
Fourth, we'll be discussing some
real world integration scenarios,

22
00:01:23,395 --> 00:01:27,435
which which many of us might
have overcome in our experience.

23
00:01:27,825 --> 00:01:30,285
And we'll also discuss some
practical examples from

24
00:01:30,285 --> 00:01:31,605
different industries as well.

25
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:37,075
And finally, we'll also look at benefits
and future outlook where we will summarize

26
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:41,425
the advantages of this approach and
look ahead to emerging opportunities.

27
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:45,865
Let us begin by exploring the integration
challenge that exists in nearly.

28
00:01:46,465 --> 00:01:48,840
Almost most of the enterprises
that we have that we have.

29
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,210
So in today, in almost every
organization today, the technology

30
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,660
landscape is a mixture of different
generation and types of systems.

31
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,829
There are more than SaaS platforms,
longstanding ERP systems, custom built

32
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:06,600
applications, industry specific tools,
and in many cases legacy systems

33
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,845
that have been in place for decades.

34
00:02:08,345 --> 00:02:12,695
Salesforce has become the leading CRM,
also customer relationship management

35
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:17,165
platform, and is often at the center
of digital transformation initiatives.

36
00:02:17,674 --> 00:02:22,295
It is, its automation capabilities are
strong and its ecosystem is extensive.

37
00:02:22,804 --> 00:02:28,445
However, even with these trends,
Salesforce cannot on its own, achieve

38
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:32,915
complete frictionless automation
across every system in the enterprise.

39
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:36,379
This is not a shortcoming
of Salesforce as a platform.

40
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:40,309
Rather, it's a reflection of the
reality in which enterprises operate.

41
00:02:41,089 --> 00:02:43,429
Not all systems have modern APIs.

42
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,469
Some processes still depends on physical
documentation or offline workflows.

43
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:52,309
Others require human interaction
with outdated interfaces.

44
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,629
These realities create integration
challenges that cannot be solved

45
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,364
with NATO sales post tools alone.

46
00:02:58,864 --> 00:03:02,855
Next we'll talk about the en
the enterprise integration gap.

47
00:03:03,364 --> 00:03:08,464
Integration gaps typically occur in
four main areas, modern APIs that

48
00:03:08,464 --> 00:03:12,964
still require middleware and careful
orchestration, middleware and connectors

49
00:03:12,964 --> 00:03:14,855
that introduce complexity and cost.

50
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:20,075
External portals that require
manual data transfer and file

51
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:24,545
based processes involving Excel
CSV PDFs and similar formats.

52
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:29,345
And finally, legacy systems with
proprietary or terminal based interfaces.

53
00:03:29,765 --> 00:03:34,805
These gaps result in manual work,
increase cycle times and higher costs.

54
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:38,825
Enterprises that implement RPA
alongside Salesforce often.

55
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:43,595
Report measurable predictive gains as
manual processing time per employee

56
00:03:43,595 --> 00:03:48,155
per week is significant, significantly
reduced, and also in many cases,

57
00:03:48,364 --> 00:03:52,355
we might not find the right or the
best resource that can still work on

58
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:58,055
legacy systems or even any developers
that still work on legacy systems.

59
00:03:58,834 --> 00:04:02,045
Now let's discuss about native
Salesforce automation tools.

60
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,435
Salesforce provides several
native automation capabilities.

61
00:04:05,674 --> 00:04:08,450
The first one of which Salesforce
have improved a lot is flows.

62
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:11,914
Visual workflow builder that
allows administrators to create

63
00:04:11,914 --> 00:04:13,925
complex logic without writing code.

64
00:04:14,495 --> 00:04:18,005
Enterprise grade developments can,
processes, can process hundreds

65
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:19,445
of transactions per second.

66
00:04:19,945 --> 00:04:23,740
We, we have the standard APEX programming,
which is a proprietary programming

67
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,400
language, enabling developers to
build custom logic and sophisticated

68
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,539
integrations covering most business
use cases when properly architected.

69
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,200
We have the standard web services
that Salesforce provides as well,

70
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,780
including rest and soap APIs to expose.

71
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:39,445
Salesforce functionality.

72
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:44,965
Externally, I'm the bulk API for high
volume of synchronous data processing.

73
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:49,945
We have platform events which enable
event driven real time integrations

74
00:04:49,945 --> 00:04:52,344
between Salesforce and external systems.

75
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:56,755
While these tools are really powerful,
we might still have difficulties

76
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,515
communicating with some of the
systems that we have discussed,

77
00:04:59,575 --> 00:05:01,875
like Excel or legacy systems.

78
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:05,914
It all, it also depends on what
the target system provides, right?

79
00:05:06,414 --> 00:05:09,445
Next, let's discuss where
Natto tools falls out.

80
00:05:09,505 --> 00:05:14,244
As I was saying, so natto Salesforce
automation tools, face limitations in four

81
00:05:14,244 --> 00:05:17,155
key areas, legacy system integrations.

82
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:23,304
Systems without APIs require manual
data entry or specialized connectors.

83
00:05:23,664 --> 00:05:29,664
File-based processes such as handling
Excel spreadsheets, PDF PDFs, or scan

84
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:34,645
forms that require human processing,
external web portals where data

85
00:05:34,645 --> 00:05:39,655
must be transferred manually between
applications, cross system orchestration.

86
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,890
When workflows span multiple systems
with varied integration capabilities,

87
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:50,080
making end-to-end automation difficult,
these scenarios require an alternate

88
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,020
approach to achieve full automation,
RPA, the bridge between Salesforce

89
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,099
and the enterprise Robotic Process
automation represents a shift in how

90
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:03,869
integration can be achieved instead of
relying only on the APIs and middleware.

91
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:07,320
RPA operates at the user interface level.

92
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:12,119
Just as a human user word, but faster,
more accurately, and without fat fatigue.

93
00:06:12,429 --> 00:06:17,770
RPA can be used to replace tedious manual
work that has to be done on a daily

94
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,960
basis, where the system can handle all the
clicks and the automation that the u the

95
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,570
manual automation that a person can do.

96
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,919
RPA can take over all
of those capabilities.

97
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:32,689
So performance assessments should
show that RPA bots deliver exceptional

98
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:34,639
accuracy in UI interactions.

99
00:06:35,015 --> 00:06:37,715
And can reduce processing
times dramatically.

100
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:42,424
This approach allows integration
with systems that otherwise cannot

101
00:06:42,424 --> 00:06:46,534
be connected natively extending
Salesforce automation capabilities

102
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,965
across the entire enterprise ecosystem.

103
00:06:49,465 --> 00:06:54,625
Now, let's discuss how RPA complements
Salesforce RPA enhances Salesforce

104
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,185
automation in four distinct ways.

105
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,989
Navigate any interface.

106
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:03,369
RPA bots can work with web browsers,
desktop applications, terminal

107
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:06,219
emulators, and even Citrix environments.

108
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,320
This reduces integration development
time compared to API based approaches

109
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,630
process unstructured data when
combined with AI capabilities like

110
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,210
OCR and Natural Language Processing.

111
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,969
RPA can extract data from documents.

112
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,090
Emails and images with high accuracy.

113
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:29,289
Maintain audit trail,
every bot action is logged.

114
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:33,760
Providing visibility for compliance
and troubleshooting and improving

115
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,349
incident detection rates.

116
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,119
Scale on demand.

117
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,670
Bots can be scaled instantly to
match workload demands, handling

118
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,150
complex workflows without
additional administrative overhead.

119
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,820
These trends make RPA and Salesforce
together a powerful combination

120
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,440
for enterprise automation.

121
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,090
Now let's discuss some real
world integration scenarios.

122
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,980
So first, let's go with order processing.

123
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:04,890
In an automated order processing workflow,
a board moer Salesforce for new orders.

124
00:08:05,505 --> 00:08:07,545
Let's say, oh, here we
are integrating with SAP.

125
00:08:07,545 --> 00:08:11,895
It logs into the SAP interface, navigates
to the correct screens and enters.

126
00:08:11,895 --> 00:08:14,505
The bot itself can type
in the order details.

127
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:18,675
It captures the confirmation number
and updates Salesforce automatically

128
00:08:19,185 --> 00:08:23,655
any exceptions are flagged for human
review, and these exceptions can

129
00:08:23,655 --> 00:08:25,635
be reported in Salesforce as well.

130
00:08:26,385 --> 00:08:31,305
This automation achieves substantial
annual savings and reduce both cycle

131
00:08:31,305 --> 00:08:33,795
times and error rates to minimal level.

132
00:08:34,294 --> 00:08:39,874
As I was saying, when we combine RPA and
Salesforce, it uses more powerful tool

133
00:08:40,204 --> 00:08:44,314
than Salesforce, working by itself with
the standard or native APIs that we have.

134
00:08:45,244 --> 00:08:49,954
Next, let's discuss about real world
integration scenario Invoice processing.

135
00:08:50,454 --> 00:08:55,254
Invoice processing often involves multiple
formats and manual validation steps.

136
00:08:55,614 --> 00:08:59,724
The RPS solution is as follows,
OCR technology extracts

137
00:08:59,724 --> 00:09:01,104
data from scanned invoices.

138
00:09:02,064 --> 00:09:06,594
The bot validates this data against
purchase orders in Salesforce.

139
00:09:06,954 --> 00:09:11,814
Approved invoices are entered into
the accounting system, discrepancies

140
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:14,124
generate Salesforce cases for review.

141
00:09:14,574 --> 00:09:18,294
This reduces handling time from
minutes to seconds per documents.

142
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:20,920
And improves accuracy significantly.

143
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,859
With this, it helps us read the document.

144
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:28,449
RPA itself can help us read the document
and also if there's any data that has

145
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:33,399
to be stored that is in the document
back into Salesforce as on a particular

146
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:35,619
record that is possible as well.

147
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:40,410
Now for next scenario, let's
discuss real world integration

148
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,869
scenario compliance data collection.

149
00:09:43,739 --> 00:09:47,519
Manual compliance checks require
staff to visit numerous websites,

150
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,479
search for providers, and copy
credential information into Salesforce.

151
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:57,089
With the help of RPA, bots accesses
licensing websites on a schedule, this

152
00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:00,089
search for providers listed in Salesforce.

153
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:05,039
They capture license status,
expiration dates, and other details.

154
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:08,549
Salesforce records are updated
automatically, as we saw in our

155
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:13,769
previous example where RPA can read
a document and update Salesforce back

156
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:15,059
with the data that's in the document.

157
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:19,649
Similarly, in this example, RPA can
still go to go through different

158
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:24,479
websites, gather information from their
store it in rp, and at the final step

159
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:26,759
we can update it back to Salesforce.

160
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:30,569
Organizations benefit from
lower audit preparation costs

161
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:34,559
fewer compliance, penalities,
and substantial annual savings.

162
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:35,929
Let's discuss.

163
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:38,689
Let's go through a basic
technical architecture of RPS

164
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:40,629
Salesforce integration it.

165
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:44,589
The technical architecture includes
four pillars, monitoring and

166
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:49,479
governance, centralized observability,
dashboards, alerting, and SLA

167
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:52,059
management integration patterns.

168
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:56,709
Clear separation of bot initiative versus
Salesforce initiative flows aligned to

169
00:10:56,709 --> 00:10:59,139
system constraints and latency needs.

170
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:05,619
Security framework least privilege
access, credential, valuing auditability

171
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:11,229
and compliance control, development and
environment, standardized pipelines,

172
00:11:11,229 --> 00:11:12,879
version control environments.

173
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:18,209
For Dow Test and PRO and repeated
developments, organizations are

174
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,920
adopting tightly integrated.

175
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:27,479
API first designs in concert with
RPA typically achieve higher through

176
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:30,810
throughput and lower latency than
traditional middleware only solutions.

177
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,489
Next, let's discuss some
integration patterns.

178
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,849
There are two primary patterns,
bot initiated actions.

179
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:43,070
Bots call Salesforce, REST APIs
to trigger workflows and update

180
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:47,360
records achieving significant
latency reduction for certain steps.

181
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,895
Bot bots can interact directly
with Salesforce UI when needed.

182
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,939
Bots can publish platform events
to initiate real time processing

183
00:11:55,939 --> 00:11:57,829
with strong data consistency.

184
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:03,500
Next is gonna be Salesforce initiated
automation outbound messages from

185
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,360
Salesforce Notify RPA Orchestrators
to Start Bots Platform events

186
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,530
are consumed by RPA listeners
to launch tasks in real time.

187
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,689
Custom Epic scholars can invoke bot
endpoint supporting higher stride.

188
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,760
Through processing rates.

189
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,689
Selecting the pattern depends on
the system of record, transaction

190
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,230
volume, latency requirements,
and operational controls.

191
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:32,530
Now let's discuss some benefits of
native RP integration in Salesforce.

192
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,880
Some of the key benefits include single
vendor, red, reduced procurement and

193
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,430
contract management overhead, consistent
user experience, lower integration related

194
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,100
incidents within a unified architecture.

195
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,750
Integrated governance where we can
have faster security administration

196
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:54,670
and audit preparation, simplified
licensing and training where it

197
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,710
helps us lower enablement costs.

198
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:02,500
These advantages translate directly into
lower operational costs and strong ROI.

199
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,849
Let's discuss some
implementation best practices.

200
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,839
Effective implementation
follows three best practices.

201
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:11,875
Start with process discovery.

202
00:13:12,714 --> 00:13:13,995
Document current manual steps.

203
00:13:14,685 --> 00:13:19,665
Identify systems without APIs and
calculate RI to prioritize use cases.

204
00:13:19,935 --> 00:13:21,314
It's always start small.

205
00:13:21,555 --> 00:13:25,264
We don't have to build a complicated
process where we want to replace

206
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:27,034
RPA, so we gotta start small.

207
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:30,914
Understand how RPA works better for,
again, for every individual company.

208
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:36,134
Design for resilience, implement rigorous
error handling, fallback parts for

209
00:13:36,134 --> 00:13:40,394
system downtime, proactive notifications
and plan maintenance windows.

210
00:13:41,084 --> 00:13:45,704
Maintain human oversight, configure
exception workflows with high first time

211
00:13:45,704 --> 00:13:51,104
resolution, provide performance dashboards
and institute approvals where appropriate.

212
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:56,614
We also want, we also need to make
sure that when RPA as, when the bot is

213
00:13:56,614 --> 00:13:59,795
interacting with a particular website,
or if it's interacting with a particular

214
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:03,740
screen, whenever there's any kind of
upgrade done to the website we have to

215
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,219
make sure that same kind of maintenance
is done to the bots as well, so that

216
00:14:07,219 --> 00:14:09,050
the click that, that the bot does.

217
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:14,134
Still works as expected these
approaches and ensure reliability

218
00:14:14,224 --> 00:14:15,665
while preserving control.

219
00:14:16,165 --> 00:14:19,754
Next, let's discuss some successes,
some KPIs and metrics here.

220
00:14:20,384 --> 00:14:24,434
And average 80% reduction in processing
time because it's gonna reduce

221
00:14:24,434 --> 00:14:29,924
manual, manual effort, drastically
95% improvement in error rates.

222
00:14:30,224 --> 00:14:34,574
Again, that's a very high chance of, it's
a manual process for there to be errors

223
00:14:34,844 --> 00:14:36,734
and three times increase in volume handle.

224
00:14:37,234 --> 00:14:41,224
Qualitative benefits include higher
employee satisfaction, faster

225
00:14:41,224 --> 00:14:45,544
customer delivery times fewer
compliance penalities, and improved

226
00:14:45,544 --> 00:14:48,274
scalability for high volume scenarios.

227
00:14:48,774 --> 00:14:52,135
Next, let's discuss some industry
specific applications and ROI.

228
00:14:52,635 --> 00:14:57,075
In healthcare, automated
credentialing reduces audit costs

229
00:14:57,135 --> 00:14:58,935
and integrate legacy systems.

230
00:14:58,995 --> 00:15:02,475
There are still a lot of companies
where there are legacy systems which

231
00:15:02,475 --> 00:15:07,575
do not have proper APIs, where that
is where RPA can come in and help

232
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:10,995
integrate with those legacy systems
and also speed up the process.

233
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:14,625
In manufacturing, all
cycle times are reduced.

234
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,620
Customer satisfaction improves
and repeat business' increases in

235
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,870
financial services, document processing
costs, job and accuracy for standard

236
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,670
documents remains near perfect.

237
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,110
Some of this, some of the main, one of
the main benefit, as we discussed was

238
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,150
where RPA can help read through the
document and scan through it completely,

239
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:41,261
process the data and update it back to
Salesforce, where the data that's in the

240
00:15:41,261 --> 00:15:43,420
document can be reported in Salesforce.

241
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,130
Future outlook, the evolution
of enterprise automation.

242
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:53,820
The next phase is the convergence of
RPA, AI and CRM, intelligent processing

243
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,890
automation, AI driven decision
making, NLP and predictive analytics,

244
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,085
hyper automation, orchestrating
millions of transactions daily.

245
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,820
And finally, digital twins maintaining
real time process models for optimization.

246
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:14,370
These capabilities will accelerate
digital transformation and reduce

247
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,350
technical resource requirements.

248
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,640
Embracing the automation imperative.

249
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,070
The integration of Salesforce CRM and RPA
represents more than a technical upgrade.

250
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,185
It is the strategic
imperative by leveraging CRM.

251
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:32,270
Integration and RPA Legacy connectors.

252
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:36,260
Together organizations create
end-to-end automation without

253
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,210
replacing existing infrastructure.

254
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:45,200
Research across hundreds of enterprises
shows that tightly integrated R-P-S-C-R-M

255
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:49,980
strategies correlate with higher rates
of digital transformation success, and

256
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,321
substantial higher return on investment.

257
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:57,391
And some of the key takeaways that we
have that we discussed are RPA bridges the

258
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:01,710
gap between Salesforce and Legacy systems
enabling full end-to-end automation.

259
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,911
The measurable benefits span
industries and includes significant

260
00:17:05,911 --> 00:17:10,411
R-O-I-R-P-A enhances rather
than replaces human potential.

261
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,250
With RPA human error
can be reduced to none.

262
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:15,480
Basically none.

263
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,500
The time to implement is now to
maintain competitive advantage.

264
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,680
Thank you for attending this session.

265
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,730
The integration of RPA with Salesforce
is not simply a technical improvement.

266
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:29,450
It is a strategic imperative
for organizations seeking to

267
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,370
lead in a digital first world.

268
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,760
Again, Thank you for
attending this session.

269
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,480
Take care.
