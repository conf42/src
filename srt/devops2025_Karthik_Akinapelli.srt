1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,110
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,710
Greetings of the day.

3
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:07,030
My name is Karthik Akinnapelli and
I'm hoping you're all doing well.

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:12,410
Today, I'm excited to share the
results of a trial conducted to

5
00:00:12,489 --> 00:00:17,920
evaluate a new oral antibiotic in
comparison to Emprixiprofloxacin.

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:19,369
So why late?

7
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:22,669
Let's dive into the study
and look at its key findings.

8
00:00:23,169 --> 00:00:26,069
So before we jump into the trial
information, let me give you a

9
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:27,640
little bit background of this trial.

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,990
So why new antibiotic?

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,710
There is a growing concern about
increasing fluoroquinolone resistance in

12
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:41,539
real world settings, which significantly
limits treatment options for uncomplicated

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,910
urinary tract infections in outpatient
setting, which leads to hospitalization.

14
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:48,990
Now why sulopenum?

15
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,540
Sulopenum is the first oral
theopenum antibiotic specifically

16
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:58,350
developed to combat multi drug
resistant gram negative uropathogens.

17
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:03,700
Neuropathogens are nothing but pathogens
responsible for urinary tract infections.

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,380
Now about this study.

19
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,370
This is a phase 3 double blind study
evaluating the efficacy and safety of

20
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,809
a five day course of sulopenum compared
to the standard three day regimen of

21
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:20,250
ciprofloxacin in adult women with UUTIs.

22
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,500
Coming to the end point, the primary
end point is a robust composite measure.

23
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,260
assessing both clinical symptom
resolution and microbiological

24
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:36,120
eradication at the test of cure
visit which is day 12 in the study.

25
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,769
Now let's look at enrollment overview.

26
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:48,100
A total of 1672 women were enrolled in
the trial of which 1660 participants

27
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,610
were qualified for the safety
population, meaning they received

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,939
at least one dose of study drug.

29
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,129
Whereas 1072 participants
qualified into microbiological

30
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,739
intent to treat population.

31
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:06,119
This is where the primary
endpoint is evaluated.

32
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:09,570
The criteria to qualify into
this population is that the

33
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:14,980
baseline pathogen should have
at least 10 to the 5 CFU per ml.

34
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,490
CFU is nothing but colony forming units.

35
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,200
Now, key findings.

36
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,089
Essertia coli was the predominant
pathogen accounting for approximately 85

37
00:02:26,089 --> 00:02:29,029
percent of all infections in this study.

38
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:34,989
Of these, 27 percent demonstrated
non susceptibility to ciprofloxacin.

39
00:02:35,749 --> 00:02:37,200
That is pretty high rate.

40
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,089
Now second most common pathogen
identified was Klebsiella pneumonia.

41
00:02:42,589 --> 00:02:46,119
Now, looking at resistance
insights, around 13.

42
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:52,219
5 percent of the total isolates were
extended spectrum beta lactamase

43
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:58,339
producing, ESBL producing organisms,
indicating multi drug resistance.

44
00:02:58,839 --> 00:03:01,439
Now, let's look at efficacy results.

45
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:04,139
in non susceptible pathogens.

46
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:10,879
Sulopenum demonstrated clear superiority
over ciprofloxacin in treating non

47
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:17,419
susceptible pathogens with a significant
treatment difference in efficacy of 26.

48
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,649
6 percent and a highly
significant p value.

49
00:03:21,149 --> 00:03:25,599
Now, in susceptible pathogens, sulopenum
did not achieve non inferiority.

50
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,209
The response rate for sulopenum was 66.

51
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:30,759
8 percent in solo.

52
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,089
compared to 78.

53
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:34,039
6 percent in Cipro.

54
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:39,249
Now in overall study population combining
both non susceptible and susceptible

55
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:44,769
populations, solopenem achieved non
inferiority with the response rate of 65.

56
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,939
6 in solo compared to 67.

57
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,829
9 in ciprofloxacin.

58
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:53,329
So let's look at clinical response.

59
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:57,529
The study evaluated clinical
response at various time points

60
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:59,089
with the following key findings.

61
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:04,749
At initial evaluation at day
5 of the study, solopenem and

62
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:08,519
ceprofloxacin demonstrated
comparable response rates, 68.

63
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,769
7 percent solo versus 67.

64
00:04:11,809 --> 00:04:12,959
3 percent in cipro.

65
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:19,319
At day 12, which is at, Primary
endpoint, solopenem showed similar

66
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:25,679
overall effectiveness in clinical
response compared to ciprofloxacin 81.

67
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,269
1 percent in Sulo versus 84.

68
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:32,769
1 percent in Cipro Whereas in the
resistant population, solopenem

69
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:38,199
clearly exhibited superior efficacy
83 percent in Sulo versus 62.

70
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:44,069
6 percent in Cipro Now they also evaluated
a follow-up period, which is day 28.

71
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:49,639
Both treatment groups maintained a
sustained clinical response confirming

72
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:51,679
the durability of the treatments.

73
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:59,289
Now with good clinical response, why did
Opinum did not achieve non-inferiority

74
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:01,179
in non susceptible pathogens?

75
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:04,360
This is because of a SP impact.

76
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,100
Like I said, while clinical response
rates are very comparable between

77
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,020
two treatment groups, the difference
lay in microbiological outcomes,

78
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,940
specifically the occurrence of ASB,
asymptomatic bacteria, which is

79
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,950
nothing but patients are clinically
clear, but has a positive culture.

80
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:30,930
Now, at day 12, ASB was more prevalent in
sulopinem group compared to ciprofloxacin.

81
00:05:30,951 --> 00:05:31,570
15.

82
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,480
2 percent in Sulo versus 7.

83
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:35,430
8 percent in Cipro.

84
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:41,000
Despite the higher ASB rates,
patients in both groups demonstrated

85
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,870
equivalent clinical outcomes
during follow up period at day 28,

86
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,700
as we saw in the previous slide.

87
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,320
This is confirming the
durability of the treatment.

88
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,130
So what's the conclusion?

89
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,390
The higher ASB rates with Sulopenum
likely reflect the restoration of

90
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,730
normal urogenital bacterial flora.

91
00:06:00,115 --> 00:06:04,065
rather than persistent infection
highlighting a potential

92
00:06:04,065 --> 00:06:05,645
microbiological advantage.

93
00:06:06,145 --> 00:06:09,835
Now, let's look at resistance emergence.

94
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:14,195
So, some of the key observations
include resistance development.

95
00:06:14,535 --> 00:06:17,355
Following treatment
with ciprofloxacin, 41.

96
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:22,445
7 percent of initially susceptible
pathogens developed resistance.

97
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:26,845
very high percent indicating
significant selective pressure.

98
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:33,655
Now genetic changes in pathogens post
treatment some pathogens acquired extended

99
00:06:33,755 --> 00:06:40,425
spectrum beta lactamase ESBL genes
compromising multiple antibiotic classes

100
00:06:40,925 --> 00:06:43,425
and further limiting treatment options.

101
00:06:44,045 --> 00:06:50,635
Now, looking at sulopenum MIC stability,
in contrast, MIC distribution for

102
00:06:50,635 --> 00:06:56,195
sulopenum remains stable, demonstrating
a low risk of resistance development.

103
00:06:57,095 --> 00:06:58,225
So what's the conclusion?

104
00:06:58,635 --> 00:07:03,205
The contrasting effects on bacterial
resistance patterns underscored the

105
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:07,915
critical importance of antibiotic
stewardship and informed drug

106
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:10,435
selection in managing UTIs.

107
00:07:11,155 --> 00:07:17,105
These findings highlight silopenum's
potential as a valuable option in

108
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:19,105
combating antibiotic resistance.

109
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,755
Now, let's look at safety profile.

110
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:26,205
So, both treatment groups showed
almost similar safety results.

111
00:07:26,935 --> 00:07:30,265
Silopenum showed 25 percent
of adverse event rate compared

112
00:07:30,265 --> 00:07:32,245
to ciprofloxacin at 14%.

113
00:07:33,145 --> 00:07:35,655
And the most common adverse
event include headache.

114
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:36,661
which is 4.

115
00:07:36,661 --> 00:07:39,430
2 percent in Sulo versus 3.

116
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,990
1 percent in Cipro.

117
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,560
And the next most common
adverse event found is nausea.

118
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,770
3.

119
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,320
8 percent in Sulo versus 2.

120
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,880
2 percent in Cipro.

121
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,800
Diarrhoea, which is GI
related, was significantly more

122
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,700
common with Sulopenum at 12.

123
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,450
4 percent versus 2.

124
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:06,015
5 with a mean duration of three days,
but 95 percent of cases resolved

125
00:08:06,015 --> 00:08:10,845
spontaneously while 5 percent
required anti diarrheal medication.

126
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:15,855
Other GI effects include nausea and
abdominal pain, pretty much very

127
00:08:15,855 --> 00:08:17,946
common with all antibiotic classes.

128
00:08:18,446 --> 00:08:22,260
Serious adverse event
rates are also similar, 0.

129
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,895
7 percent in versus 0.

130
00:08:23,896 --> 00:08:30,041
2 percent in Cipro and of the six
serious adverse events on solopenem,

131
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:32,561
only two were considered drug related.

132
00:08:33,061 --> 00:08:38,231
And in the course of the study, no
deaths occurred and all the SOEs are

133
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:40,351
resolved by the end of the study.

134
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:43,511
Now, implications of empirical treatment.

135
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:45,241
Similar overall efficacy.

136
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:50,391
So, solopenum showed non inferiority
to ciprofloxacin in general population

137
00:08:50,711 --> 00:08:52,421
as we seen in the previous slides.

138
00:08:53,371 --> 00:08:54,561
Resistant advantage.

139
00:08:54,961 --> 00:08:58,631
Solopenum showed superiority
to ciprofloxacin in non

140
00:08:58,631 --> 00:08:59,941
susceptible population.

141
00:09:00,441 --> 00:09:01,581
Reduce risk resistance.

142
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:06,241
As discussed in the previous
slide, solopenum demonstrated low

143
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:09,981
risk of resistance development
and giving a treatment option

144
00:09:10,011 --> 00:09:12,040
for multidrug resistant UTIs.

145
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:15,951
Cellopenem showed effectiveness
against pathogens that are

146
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:18,331
resistant to multiple antibiotics.

147
00:09:18,831 --> 00:09:22,990
Now, let's look at some study
limitations and considerations.

148
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,060
Limitations include, the study was
conducted before the implementation

149
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:32,560
of updated treatment guidelines,
which may affect its relevance

150
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,110
to current clinical practices.

151
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,330
The inclusion of ASB in the primary
endpoint may not fully align with

152
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,320
real world clinical practice patterns.

153
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,790
Now, short term follow up limits
the ability to assess the long

154
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,310
term emergence of resistance.

155
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:54,260
Coming to the key considerations, results
indicate that empiric use of ciprofloxacin

156
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,750
should be avoided in settings
where resistance rates exceed 10%.

157
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,350
Now, balancing the therapeutic
efficacy with the potential

158
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,820
for mild gastrointestinal
side effects is essential.

159
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,100
So lopinum offers a viable treatment
option for multiple drug resistant

160
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:17,110
urinary tract infections addressing a
critical gap in current treatment options.

161
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:24,155
Now, finally conclusions and further
future directions Solopenum has

162
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:29,495
demonstrated significant efficacy
in treating multi drug resistant

163
00:10:29,575 --> 00:10:34,715
urinary tract infections, providing
a crucial alternative to existing

164
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:36,655
empirical treatment options.

165
00:10:37,155 --> 00:10:40,975
Incorporating regional antibiotic
resistance data into clinical

166
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:45,155
decision making is essential to
optimize therapeutic outcomes.

167
00:10:45,655 --> 00:10:50,105
The study highlights sulopenem's
potential to minimize bacterial

168
00:10:50,105 --> 00:10:54,265
resistance development while
maintaining its therapeutic efficacy.

169
00:10:54,765 --> 00:10:59,285
There is a critical need to further
investigate long term resistance

170
00:10:59,315 --> 00:11:04,190
patterns and patient outcomes through
comprehensive longitudinal studies.

171
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:09,380
Finally, continued exploration
