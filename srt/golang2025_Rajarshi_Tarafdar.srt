1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
Hi all.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:06,140
This is today I'm going talk about
the topic revolutionizing industry

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,340
with AI and the collaborative
workflow intelligence framework.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,980
Today we'll be seeing how the Golan
and the artificial intelligence are

5
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:17,530
resetting the automation heavy industries.

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:23,980
we'll examine various, like industries,
like finance, manufacturing, and see how

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,450
the collaborative workflow, is working.

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,490
Basically, it is the bridge
between the, human expertise

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,160
and the, machine intelligence.

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:38,490
Our framework offers a very structured
approach, solutions, Characteristics,

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,360
there are like a different, a good
number of resource, oriented values.

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,650
we can see from, different,
domains such as manufacturing,

13
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,290
logistics, and financial services.

14
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,340
we'll, slowly, discovering
the coming slides, how, these,

15
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,349
collaborative, workflow framework
enhances, the performance.

16
00:01:00,054 --> 00:01:01,044
And cost reduction.

17
00:01:01,544 --> 00:01:02,924
Let's go to the next slide.

18
00:01:03,424 --> 00:01:06,314
Welcome, the challenges
of the modern automation.

19
00:01:06,374 --> 00:01:10,104
in this slide, there are like
a four, points I have tried

20
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:11,754
to mention here in this slide.

21
00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:14,994
One is the balancing automation
with human oversight.

22
00:01:15,544 --> 00:01:18,480
another is the, real
time processing demands.

23
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:24,509
Integration complexity and, workforce,
automation, with human oversight.

24
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:28,204
there are organizations
which trying to, of.

25
00:01:28,704 --> 00:01:34,014
they are trying to, maintain the proper
industry standards and, safety standards.

26
00:01:34,484 --> 00:01:38,234
that is one of the major challenges
the modern industry is facing.

27
00:01:38,714 --> 00:01:42,970
So our, framework, will,
definitely, take this into account

28
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,360
for the, for balancing the.

29
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,370
then the, as for the real time
processing, so modern industry is

30
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:52,049
dealing with a huge data volumes.

31
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:58,150
So it needs, immediate analysis and
response, for the, massive data.

32
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,690
it, Then there comes the,
integration complexity.

33
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,489
we're dealing about,
complex, technologies.

34
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:09,819
so we need various, like a flexible
solutions to cope up with that.

35
00:02:10,544 --> 00:02:12,213
And then there comes
the, workforce, adapt.

36
00:02:13,043 --> 00:02:17,973
in, in our current days, employees
need clear frameworks to, collaborate

37
00:02:17,973 --> 00:02:22,463
effectively with the AI systems,
rather than the, competing with them.

38
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:27,263
There needs to be exact, balance
between the AI and the humans.

39
00:02:27,723 --> 00:02:29,678
we can, get the desire.

40
00:02:30,178 --> 00:02:33,438
what is, collaborative workflow
intelligence framework?

41
00:02:33,828 --> 00:02:38,198
Basically, it's a human ai,
partnership and it'll take, the

42
00:02:38,378 --> 00:02:43,688
ethical oversights and, context,
sensitive decisions, in this, in this

43
00:02:43,778 --> 00:02:46,058
bidirectional information flow model.

44
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:51,518
And it, used to learn from the
continuous, learning and adapt to the,

45
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:56,719
for, adapt to the, just performance,
feedback, to get it more accurate.

46
00:02:57,028 --> 00:03:01,488
the framework also, has a, like
very high performance concurrent,

47
00:03:01,538 --> 00:03:02,978
processing architecture.

48
00:03:03,478 --> 00:03:07,538
Are like, the collaborative workflow
intelligence framework, establishes

49
00:03:07,658 --> 00:03:12,508
clear boundaries between the AI and the
human decision authorities, creating

50
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:16,853
a symbiotic relationships, that,
leverages the strength of the both.

51
00:03:17,353 --> 00:03:23,444
It is very high, concurrency model,
performance and it be used in the

52
00:03:23,444 --> 00:03:26,084
real processing for large, data.

53
00:03:27,029 --> 00:03:29,399
This is not just a theoretical concept.

54
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:34,228
it can be, used, practically in
different, industries like finance,

55
00:03:34,228 --> 00:03:39,699
manufacturing, and it can be used in
complex scenarios and where there are

56
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:42,178
like, lot of technical complexity.

57
00:03:42,528 --> 00:03:45,163
this framework, definitely
benefits from that.

58
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:48,393
So there different, advantages.

59
00:03:48,423 --> 00:03:53,403
we can select, like from the other
framework, we, we can say of the

60
00:03:53,403 --> 00:03:56,283
exceptional performance of, framework.

61
00:03:56,793 --> 00:04:01,393
And, there are like a different, garbage
collection efficiency, modules, which can

62
00:04:01,393 --> 00:04:06,533
enable the microsecond response times,
essential for industry automations.

63
00:04:07,143 --> 00:04:10,533
it helps seen improving the
performance and we have given

64
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:15,238
some benchmark of around, 40 to
60% improvements we are seeing.

65
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:17,628
Language, implementations.

66
00:04:18,078 --> 00:04:20,598
Then there comes the,
built-in concurrency.

67
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:25,803
it gives, multi, multi-threading,
capabilities, perfect for, managing

68
00:04:25,803 --> 00:04:27,453
a large amount of data streams.

69
00:04:27,663 --> 00:04:30,153
Currently, our industry is
dealing with a large amount

70
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:32,043
of data and complex technical.

71
00:04:32,528 --> 00:04:33,038
Scenario.

72
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:38,958
And it helps in, just, building, with
con on top of any technical complexity.

73
00:04:39,018 --> 00:04:43,563
And this is by far, justing the,
traditional, threading models.

74
00:04:44,063 --> 00:04:47,303
And then there comes
the strong type safety.

75
00:04:47,903 --> 00:04:53,303
So colon static typing prevents common
runtime, errors, crucial for mission

76
00:04:53,303 --> 00:04:57,733
sensitive, industry applications
where system failures, can have

77
00:04:57,733 --> 00:05:02,323
significant consequences in terms of
revenue and production continuity.

78
00:05:02,663 --> 00:05:07,803
here the, our framework, helps in,
So we are talking about the technical

79
00:05:07,803 --> 00:05:11,834
strengths here, but also apart from
the technical strengths, goal and

80
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:16,453
simplicity and readability also make
it, for the, cross-functional teams

81
00:05:16,453 --> 00:05:20,664
where the engineers and the data
scientists, can collaborate closely.

82
00:05:21,008 --> 00:05:26,443
it is also using the standard,
library, which dependencies and.

83
00:05:26,943 --> 00:05:27,963
To the next slide.

84
00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:31,013
We have went through
a number of use cases.

85
00:05:31,053 --> 00:05:34,583
one is the, manufacturing,
sector implementation.

86
00:05:35,243 --> 00:05:40,438
so in this, we have went through a
few, module like, sensor integration,

87
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:45,778
predictive analytics, intelligent
and human direction resolution.

88
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:50,628
in sensor integration, Golan
microservices, collect and

89
00:05:50,628 --> 00:05:55,998
normalize data from, heterogeneous
sensor networks across, factory

90
00:05:55,998 --> 00:05:58,488
floors and predictive analysis.

91
00:05:58,698 --> 00:06:02,908
it, analysis the pattern, to,
predictive the maintenance needs.

92
00:06:03,408 --> 00:06:08,408
And then comes the intelligent,
so intelligent alerting,

93
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:11,558
the notifications issues.

94
00:06:12,058 --> 00:06:15,878
Then, we also, go through the
human director resolution.

95
00:06:16,178 --> 00:06:20,378
So it makes in the final decision
making on the complex and

96
00:06:20,378 --> 00:06:22,608
maintenance, and quality issues.

97
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:26,578
so ai, requirements, those
complex financial decisions.

98
00:06:27,078 --> 00:06:31,683
And it, we have owned to a, like a,
successful, like a metrics for these

99
00:06:31,763 --> 00:06:38,573
17% reduction in the, like a production
delays, around 23% in unplanned downtime.

100
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:42,593
The, systems ability to integrate,
with the existing systems.

101
00:06:42,643 --> 00:06:44,463
We are seeing investment

102
00:06:44,963 --> 00:06:45,183
in.

103
00:06:45,683 --> 00:06:50,804
We are also going to the, logistics,
optimization case study where we're

104
00:06:50,804 --> 00:06:54,744
doing the route planning, load
balancing, exception handling,

105
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:56,234
and performance analysis.

106
00:06:56,744 --> 00:07:01,409
So in route planning, we s the optimal,
delivery sequences, accounting for.

107
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:05,619
And, load balancing it, helps
in allocating in the dynamically

108
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:07,389
allocating the resources.

109
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:12,769
therefore, making the, cost optimization
and, exception handling, human

110
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:18,809
dispatchers, review the AI recommendations
in critical unusual situations, which.

111
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:20,479
Performance analysis.

112
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,829
So here, we going through improvement

113
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:27,849
information and we can
get the recognition.

114
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:33,459
And for the performance analysis
and, we're getting here, almost

115
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:39,099
80, 30, 12%, cost reduction in the
regional logistic, provider for this

116
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:44,674
kind of, architecture, this kind of
framework implementation and on time

117
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:47,554
delivery rates also improved by 14%.

118
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:50,634
And, real time adjustments also.

119
00:07:51,134 --> 00:07:54,244
Now coming to the, financial,
services application.

120
00:07:54,244 --> 00:07:58,174
So we have discovered like a
few modules in this, under this

121
00:07:58,174 --> 00:08:00,154
financial services application.

122
00:08:00,694 --> 00:08:02,584
One is the, document processing.

123
00:08:02,684 --> 00:08:08,804
in this state, AI extracts and,
the data from the loan applications

124
00:08:08,804 --> 00:08:10,019
and the supporting documents.

125
00:08:10,944 --> 00:08:15,804
then the risk assessment goal length
services from complex risk calculations

126
00:08:15,804 --> 00:08:22,104
with, subsecond, millisecond latency and
continuous learning system goes through

127
00:08:22,104 --> 00:08:24,674
the, feedback on decisions and outcomes.

128
00:08:24,674 --> 00:08:28,564
And this will help in making
the, optimized solutions.

129
00:08:29,064 --> 00:08:32,934
Underwriter focus on complex
cases flagged by the system.

130
00:08:33,684 --> 00:08:38,704
A mid-size regional bank, implemented
this framework for their loan processing

131
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:45,094
operations, which in fact helped in 25%
implemented the loan approval efficiency

132
00:08:45,514 --> 00:08:47,434
while maintaining their risk profile.

133
00:08:47,934 --> 00:08:52,689
So it's evaluating all the complex
case scenario applications.

134
00:08:53,189 --> 00:08:58,999
And it has particularly good features,
environment and making it more,

135
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:01,899
performance has more performance.

136
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,569
And, we have gained significant
business impact for this framework.

137
00:09:06,749 --> 00:09:11,209
And, from the manufacturing production
efficiency improvement standpoint,

138
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:13,899
there were, percent, reduced delays.

139
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:17,604
And, 25%, processing efficiency.

140
00:09:17,604 --> 00:09:21,594
Also, we can get, when we're just going
through the use case of the financial

141
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:26,424
services applications throughput
increase, and, for the logistic

142
00:09:26,424 --> 00:09:31,494
delivery optimization savings, we are
getting eight to 12%, cost reductions.

143
00:09:32,164 --> 00:09:37,709
And, 32% for the, like employee
satisfaction, when we're just worker

144
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:40,679
engagements across implementations.

145
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:41,619
there.

146
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:46,189
A good number of metrics we can solve
for this, f framework, which can

147
00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:48,559
use to drivers range of industries.

148
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:53,329
the combination of the LANs,
performance characteristics and along

149
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:58,564
with the ai, human collaboration
definitely, makes a competitive

150
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:01,284
advantage over the traditional, models.

151
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:01,344
We.

152
00:10:01,844 --> 00:10:05,694
Then organizations also report,
significant, improvements in the

153
00:10:05,694 --> 00:10:10,224
ability to extract and retain the
technical talent as the framework,

154
00:10:11,004 --> 00:10:14,964
the engaging roles that emphasize
the human judgment and creativity

155
00:10:15,564 --> 00:10:17,694
rather than the routine processing.

156
00:10:18,194 --> 00:10:22,109
So implementation methodology,
we can, four, the,

157
00:10:22,609 --> 00:10:26,269
the map, the current processes
and the decision boundaries.

158
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:32,449
This comes the advisory pilot where we
deploy AI in the recommendation only mode.

159
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:34,939
That is the supervised automation.

160
00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:37,669
gradually increase automation
with the oversight.

161
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:41,389
Fourth is the continuous
optimization refined based on the

162
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:43,099
performance data and the feedback.

163
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:48,639
Our implementation approach, emphasizes
gradual adoption, starting with

164
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,659
systems that provide recommendations
but lead decisions to humans.

165
00:10:53,294 --> 00:10:56,954
goal's, modularity support this
incremental approach through,

166
00:10:57,164 --> 00:10:58,784
clear service boundaries.

167
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:03,104
And, change management is also
integrated through the process, with

168
00:11:03,104 --> 00:11:07,804
education programs that helps, workers
understand how the AI will be complement

169
00:11:07,804 --> 00:11:10,564
their roles rather than just them.

170
00:11:11,494 --> 00:11:13,414
Technical architectural overview.

171
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:18,524
so this C architecture,
there are three layers.

172
00:11:19,154 --> 00:11:23,674
One is the data collection
microservices, and AI processing core

173
00:11:24,154 --> 00:11:26,334
and the, human interface components.

174
00:11:26,994 --> 00:11:31,044
goal powers the critical performance
path, particularly in the data collection

175
00:11:31,044 --> 00:11:35,604
and transformation layers where the
concurrency demands at the highest.

176
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:39,589
So we have going through various
benchmark competition here.

177
00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:45,069
So we have just on the previous,
systems, and then we have going through

178
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:49,869
the processing times and the memory
usage of the previous systems, and also

179
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:54,094
in the Python implementations, Java
implementations and goal implementations.

180
00:11:54,584 --> 00:11:54,934
These.

181
00:11:55,434 --> 00:12:01,164
real time processing much more faster than
almost like three to 11 times, processing

182
00:12:01,524 --> 00:12:04,004
faster, than the, traditional models.

183
00:12:04,364 --> 00:12:08,804
And also it helps, in taking
the, less memory, compared

184
00:12:08,804 --> 00:12:10,094
to the traditional models.

185
00:12:10,614 --> 00:12:14,144
it, allocation of the resources
in all the environments.

186
00:12:14,644 --> 00:12:17,764
So what will be our next
steps in the future research?

187
00:12:17,924 --> 00:12:21,424
we definitely need to focus on
the, adaptive, learning models.

188
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:25,594
then, we have to define on the
systems, where the, they're making

189
00:12:25,594 --> 00:12:29,744
the continuous, decision boundaries
based on the human feedback.

190
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:33,779
The outcomes, reducing the
need for manual retraining.

191
00:12:34,349 --> 00:12:38,329
Then, we're using these models in
the, already in the cross-functional,

192
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:40,969
industry, be healthcare, energy finance.

193
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:46,339
So all are now tied up into the safety
requirements and the unique regulatory,

194
00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:48,619
then the workforce evaluation.

195
00:12:48,739 --> 00:12:52,789
researching long-term impacts on
skill development and the job roles

196
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:56,989
to guide the educational and training
programs for the a augmented workspace.

197
00:12:57,489 --> 00:13:01,609
It helps, in benefits, lot of
benefits in the workforce, evolution.

198
00:13:01,969 --> 00:13:05,279
And, then there is the goal
line ecosystem expansion.

199
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:10,579
So developing, specialized libraries
and frameworks, optimizes further the

200
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:14,914
goal line for ai, human collaborative
systems in industrial context.

201
00:13:15,414 --> 00:13:21,254
we're dealing with various organizations
and ask them to, do their CWIF journey,

202
00:13:21,654 --> 00:13:23,574
with a workflow assessment workshop.

203
00:13:24,134 --> 00:13:28,774
we can, gain the maximal, amount
of the benefits our team provides.

204
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:33,344
Implementation roadmap, tailor to
your, industry context and technical

205
00:13:33,344 --> 00:13:37,724
maturity, whether it a complex
problem, definitely our model can,

206
00:13:37,824 --> 00:13:40,774
Yeah, that's all my, like in and.
