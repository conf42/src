1
00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:05,260
Today I'm going to discuss on a
topic called anti-money laundering,

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,800
which is very important in banking
and financial institutions.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,670
Let me bring my presentation doc.

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:19,699
So today we are gonna
discuss in detail about

5
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:26,770
cloud-based anti-money laundering
implementation using nice optimize tool.

6
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:27,669
Okay.

7
00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:29,489
My name is Vi Kumar.

8
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:38,410
today context is majorly we'll explore how
the implementation of cloud-based and a ML

9
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:46,690
solution has former compliance operations
at a major financial institutions helping

10
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:54,364
its streamline regulated adherence, reduce
cost, and improve investigation of CNC.

11
00:00:54,865 --> 00:00:55,405
High level.

12
00:00:56,125 --> 00:01:00,355
This case study will discuss the
challenges faced by financial

13
00:01:00,745 --> 00:01:04,164
institutions, the adoption
of a closed based solution.

14
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:09,854
The modules implemented the data
migration process and the benefits

15
00:01:10,354 --> 00:01:15,695
related to post implementation
compared to the traditional systems.

16
00:01:16,195 --> 00:01:17,454
The need for change.

17
00:01:17,484 --> 00:01:20,214
First of we, we'll understand
what is the problem with, the

18
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:22,284
legacy, the traditional systems.

19
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:26,604
Then we walk, we'll walk
through you on the benefit of

20
00:01:26,604 --> 00:01:29,815
a ML using nice optimiz, tool.

21
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:30,890
Okay?

22
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:36,310
The global regulatory demands are
becoming increasingly complex.

23
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:42,490
Regulatory bodies are introducing
Know your customer, KYC protocols,

24
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,930
due diligence checks, and expanded
reporting requirement to come back.

25
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,325
Financial claims such as money ing and.

26
00:01:52,825 --> 00:01:57,535
Financial institutions must add
ahead to these regulations across

27
00:01:57,535 --> 00:02:03,830
multiple jurisdiction, each with
its own compliance standard and the

28
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,549
framework with the legacy systems.

29
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:12,060
Traditional A ML system often rely
on outdated technology creating.

30
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,579
Silos of fragmented data and involves
cumbersome manual processes, meaning that

31
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:26,119
even though this world legacy systems are
there, basically this is not competing

32
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:32,489
with the latest times which is happening
and the financial banking system.

33
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:37,070
These systems frequently generate
high volume of false positive,

34
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:42,170
burdening compliance teams
with unnecessary investigation.

35
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:49,290
Furthermore, the systems struggle to adapt
to emerging financial pre tactics and the

36
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,655
rapid phase of regulatory change and bring

37
00:02:53,155 --> 00:02:53,815
and effect.

38
00:02:54,315 --> 00:02:55,125
New threats.

39
00:02:55,625 --> 00:03:00,275
This is what we understand why we need
to change our, what are the problem with

40
00:03:00,775 --> 00:03:03,555
the traditional legacy applications.

41
00:03:04,035 --> 00:03:10,665
That's where we got a nice
optimize cloud-based a ML system

42
00:03:11,165 --> 00:03:16,070
to overcome the problem, which
is facing by legacy systems.

43
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,650
I will give you an overview.

44
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:26,320
What exactly ni NICE Tool NICE is a
leader in financial crime and compliance

45
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,740
solutions, which is strong track
record of innovating technology and

46
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,890
the expertise in financial regulations.

47
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,200
It's often next generation
cloud-based platform tailored

48
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,090
for financial institutions.

49
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:49,880
To me the demands of modern
A ML complaints, key modules,

50
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,280
suspicious activity monitoring.

51
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:58,570
So majorly this, nice act, key modules,
suspicious activity monitoring.

52
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:05,575
Continuously analyze transaction in
real time to detect suspicious patterns.

53
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:13,474
Money ing or fraud watch list filtering
integrated with global sanctions and the

54
00:04:13,474 --> 00:04:16,329
regulatory list screaming transaction.

55
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:21,269
A known individuals
companies are countries with.

56
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:26,450
Gather and assess information
from clients to evaluate the

57
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:31,640
risk levels, helping financial
institutions assess the potential

58
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,349
for fraudulent or illegal activity.

59
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:41,819
Now, obviously to do this all the
thing for anything, we needed data.

60
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,965
We needed data.

61
00:04:43,465 --> 00:04:48,955
That's where we are first focusing on
data integration and the standardization.

62
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,715
So data sources.

63
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:55,715
Obviously for any investigation,
we needed data, so that's what

64
00:04:55,715 --> 00:04:57,155
we used to call data sources.

65
00:04:57,844 --> 00:05:01,355
Successful integration
of data from what tool?

66
00:05:01,685 --> 00:05:06,785
Critical sources such as code banking
systems, high frequency trading platforms,

67
00:05:07,685 --> 00:05:09,455
and the global payment networks.

68
00:05:09,955 --> 00:05:15,145
The integration helps to create a
consolidated, comprehensive view

69
00:05:15,145 --> 00:05:20,215
of customer under transactional
data enhancing complaints,

70
00:05:20,215 --> 00:05:22,544
capabilities, standardized data model.

71
00:05:22,874 --> 00:05:26,015
Now you are extract the
data from different sources.

72
00:05:26,885 --> 00:05:29,044
Now it is there in a single platform.

73
00:05:29,765 --> 00:05:31,715
Now we need to.

74
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:38,054
Unified schema was designed to
harmonize over 1 million transactions

75
00:05:38,445 --> 00:05:41,474
per day across multiple data sources.

76
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:47,940
This model ensures the consistent
data formatting reduces latency,

77
00:05:48,685 --> 00:05:53,825
and the facility is faster
and more acuity analytics.

78
00:05:54,325 --> 00:06:00,295
Critical data points over 200 essential
data points, including customer profiles.

79
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:05,945
Transaction patterns and risk
indicators are integrated to

80
00:06:05,945 --> 00:06:09,245
create robust complaints framework.

81
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:15,409
This mapping has in identifying
suspicious activity, ensuring complaints.

82
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:20,025
And the future proofing are
gonna changes in the regulation.

83
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:27,034
So this model is helping to integrate
the data from different sources, which

84
00:06:27,034 --> 00:06:32,694
is required for banking or financing,
institute regulations, standardized

85
00:06:32,694 --> 00:06:39,329
data model, using a unified data schema
and critical data points, which is.

86
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:42,619
Ensuring compliance in the banking system.

87
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:48,529
There's the data integration
understand model will help for us.

88
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:52,839
Next benefits of cloud,
cloud implementation.

89
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:57,015
Now majority of the applications
are moving towards cloud because

90
00:06:57,235 --> 00:06:59,070
of there are some advantages.

91
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:04,899
For implementing nice active
solution in the cloud come rather

92
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:07,639
than on-prem implementation.

93
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:13,939
Reduce infrastructure cost by
migrating to the Clay Cloud.

94
00:07:13,944 --> 00:07:19,704
The Financial Institute eliminate $2.4
million in annual hardware maintenance.

95
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:28,154
Data center print by 60%, 60%
the cost they're saving by moving

96
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:31,564
this a ML applications into cloud.

97
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:35,580
Look at the benefit 60%
they're saving in their.

98
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,290
This reduction in cost enable the
organization to allocate resource

99
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:48,590
more efficiently and invest in
strategic complaints in C two.

100
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:55,120
Now improve based upon the volume
in all offerings, a concept.

101
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:01,640
The more you are getting the data volume
you can add to scale, meaning that at

102
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:07,070
the time you can ask more resources,
more computation resources, so that

103
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:12,620
once it is processed, then it can,
you can, bring the down the cost up.

104
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,790
You are hardware and processing cost.

105
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,550
That's the meaning of scalability.

106
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:25,400
Cloud implementation, significantly
reduced system maintenance by 75%.

107
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,930
So they are taking care of
all your maintenance activity.

108
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,820
You don't require to
bother about that one.

109
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,880
You only focus on your business logic.

110
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,470
Rest, cloud, cloud providers
taking care of that.

111
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,610
Coming to advanced and
suspicious activity detection.

112
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:52,480
Basically our OPTIMIZ and NICE Ed AM
system is integrated with the four 15

113
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,600
global regulatory watch list, enabling
instance, cleaning of transactions.

114
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,090
say it is like a sniper,
it'll go and monitor what is

115
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,470
happening on the transactions.

116
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:09,395
This ensures immediate detection
of potential risk and enhance

117
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:14,345
the institution ability to meet
regulatory compliance standards.

118
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,225
Again, advanced analytics.

119
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:22,885
The system uses ML algorithm them
to process and analyze millions

120
00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:27,805
of transaction daily, and it
can detect the sophisticated

121
00:09:28,305 --> 00:09:30,645
ing patterns out of the data.

122
00:09:31,145 --> 00:09:36,965
So that you can focus on
most critical investigations.

123
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:41,015
Most of critical investigation
reduce investigation time.

124
00:09:41,475 --> 00:09:45,655
By automating the prioritization
of our, and streamlining the

125
00:09:45,855 --> 00:09:47,645
everyday gathering process.

126
00:09:48,305 --> 00:09:49,640
The solution reduce.

127
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:56,050
Regulat time by 50% allowing
compliance aim to focus on the

128
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:01,930
most critical investigation, custom
scenario development, the institution

129
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:07,090
developer lower 75 custom detection
scenarios tailored to its business

130
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,400
model and the regulatory environments.

131
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:13,900
So now our NICE am L system application.

132
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,770
So they, I adminis the study.

133
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:23,910
Most of the regulation, they made
very robust so that it can tailor

134
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,570
a particular country or particular
financial I misute requirements.

135
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,560
So it is so much robust solution.

136
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,220
Okay.

137
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,470
So you can plug and play anywhere you.

138
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,760
Scenario testing Each detection scenario
underwent rigorous testing to ensure

139
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:50,560
the acute greatly identify suspicious
behavior while minimizing false positives.

140
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,870
This validation process ensures
high levels of compliance

141
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,560
accuracy now continuous.

142
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,240
Money laundering tactics
and regularity changes.

143
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:07,030
The scenarios are regularly
updated, feedback from analysis

144
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:12,430
systematically collected, and the
use to refine detection capability.

145
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:19,225
See now today our nice optimize
solution can face all the

146
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,910
challenges, but tomorrow this money.

147
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:27,030
We take the feedback from the
different regularity authorities

148
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:33,870
and we keep updating our system
so that it can meet the financial

149
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:38,040
and banking regulatory complaints.

150
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,640
That's the meaning of wherein
our NICE optimize is having

151
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:47,890
capability to improve the latest
and greatest challenges, which are.

152
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,020
In the system.

153
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,340
Okay, now post implementation
system availability.

154
00:11:54,030 --> 00:12:01,590
So the financial institution achieved
19 9.99 uptime for a ML system ensuring

155
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,640
that no compliance monitoring gaps exist.

156
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:10,320
This is IE availability supports
real when the system is available.

157
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:17,310
99. So it can capture real time fraud
while monitoring the system, and

158
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:22,800
immediately it can give alerts so that
banking agents or financial issues can

159
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,440
take necessary actions on that one.

160
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:33,340
Automated reporting or 75% of reports
are already automated, and, with a few,

161
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,480
based upon the regularity, the small
harassment, they have to take care.

162
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,880
User interface.

163
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,920
The redesign user interface boosted
analyst productivity by 40%.

164
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:49,550
It features one click access
to essential data, customizable

165
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:55,090
dashboards, and in intelligent
workflow automation, making compliance

166
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,340
task faster and easier to manage.

167
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:05,070
The solution reduce false sellers
by 40%, meaning that I, so even

168
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:10,280
though the transaction is really
a legitimate transaction, but the

169
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,050
traditional world Legacy a ML system
used to give false positive pulse

170
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,450
positive analyst, our compliance team.

171
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:23,240
On that, transaction and, finally
they found it's a legitimate,

172
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,380
it's a good transaction.

173
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:31,300
So it's all our, a ml, I say a ML
system is taken care to remove the

174
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,335
pulse positive alerts so that it is
saving 40% off the compliance team time.

175
00:13:37,835 --> 00:13:44,155
Was improved by 60% through Advanced ml,
enabling the system to uncover complex

176
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:46,765
money handling patterns more effectively.

177
00:13:47,265 --> 00:13:53,725
Basically now, 60% whatever really,
fraud transaction out of hundred 60%

178
00:13:54,055 --> 00:13:59,440
of the transactions are really, it's
a transactions where our NICE is.

179
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:06,240
Infrastructure Cloud optimize resulted
in 35% reduction in infrastructure cost,

180
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,380
while also improving systems scalability
and performance implementation.

181
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:12,980
Speed.

182
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:19,610
Full implementation was kept, completed
in eight months, four months ahead.

183
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:23,660
The industry standards
demonstrating the efficiency of the.

184
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,655
Says Bio A ML implementation.

185
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,395
S partnership.

186
00:14:28,895 --> 00:14:33,725
Faster collaboration between business
units compliance and IT team through

187
00:14:33,725 --> 00:14:40,045
regular training committee and to
integrate with a ML system data

188
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:46,165
standardization wherein establish
strong data governance framework and.

189
00:14:46,665 --> 00:14:52,295
Standardizing data models to improve
consistency across systems leading to more

190
00:14:52,795 --> 00:14:57,250
accurate analytics and improve regulatory
monitoring, continuous improvement.

191
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,930
Already we discussed on that one.

192
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,930
So a proactive approach is essential.

193
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,420
A proactive approach is essential.

194
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,690
Scenarios, compliance process and
technology performance help to

195
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:15,020
adapt to emerging risk and ensure
compliance with evolving regulation.

196
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,100
What is meaning?

197
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,310
Meaning that there is a change.

198
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,000
There is a risk.

199
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,255
this money will come with.

200
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,870
Money illegal, transfers,
relink, transactions.

201
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,485
So we are always practically
monitoring and adapting to the

202
00:15:29,985 --> 00:15:32,385
challenges implementation roadmap.

203
00:15:32,885 --> 00:15:36,790
Begin by assessing your current
a ML system and work with Niel.

204
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,980
Optimize to create a tailored
pro migration strategy.

205
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:47,420
This approach, and ensure that your
institution can realize similar benefits

206
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:53,160
such as improving detection, accuracy,
and reduce pulse past use consultation.

207
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,970
Schedule a consultation with nice
expert to learn how you can improve your

208
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:05,750
compliance operations while ensuring
regularity and operational excellence.

209
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,500
Conclusion.

210
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,130
Thanks audience for attending my talk
on the A ML system implementation

211
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:18,640
using NICE act Optimiz tool, which
is very robust and cloud-based.

212
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,440
thanks.
