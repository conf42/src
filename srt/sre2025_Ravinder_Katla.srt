00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,020
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:05,070
My name is Ravi Kala, and first
of all thank you for giving an

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,960
opportunity to introduce myself
and then conference opportunity.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,460
So if you have any questions regarding
this topic, you can reach out to me

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,610
over the email or and link it in.

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,180
So today I'm going to discuss in
this conferences the evaluation of.

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,140
A enhanced automotive infotainment
system and that and as well as the,

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,860
I'm going to discuss the technical
innovations and then future prospects.

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,340
So let's start with
the, some basic things.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,670
So you are, automotive entertainment?

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,014
Automotive entertainment is information
plus entertainment is entertainment.

12
00:00:40,345 --> 00:00:44,595
When you are, when you sit in
a car, you see the display in

13
00:00:44,595 --> 00:00:49,775
front of your old driving suite
or in front of, in the console.

14
00:00:49,995 --> 00:00:51,525
That is the infotainment system.

15
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:55,430
You can listen the songs and then,
you can entertain the, things

16
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,379
like you could do the video games
or in a parking, in a park mode.

17
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:03,694
And then as well as the, you can do
vehicle a operations, like change

18
00:01:03,694 --> 00:01:06,215
settings or that is the info system.

19
00:01:06,335 --> 00:01:08,375
So hope you are, you know that.

20
00:01:08,824 --> 00:01:13,374
But yeah just wanted to give you
brief overview, but in this topic

21
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,850
I'm going to discuss how the AI.

22
00:01:16,449 --> 00:01:19,795
Is influential, the info interacting
with the infotainment system,

23
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:21,155
automotive infotainment system.

24
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,380
So in this conference, I'm going to
discuss the technical framework and

25
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,970
challenges and as well as the breakthrough
solutions driving the development of AA

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,460
power automotive infotainment systems.

27
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,600
So let's start with some basic
thing like the market growth

28
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,790
and technological evaluations.

29
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,320
So if you see this there are the 2023.

30
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:49,014
Around 21 part six, 3 billion revenue
from infotainment a infotainment so

31
00:01:49,134 --> 00:01:54,344
that, that use that will be projected
like 37 part 6 billion by 2023.

32
00:01:54,764 --> 00:01:58,004
A enhance system, which is
currently accounted for like

33
00:01:58,424 --> 00:02:00,974
around 42.3 of the market.

34
00:02:01,464 --> 00:02:05,584
That is expected to dominate
like, more dominate the future,

35
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,394
grow future automotive industry.

36
00:02:07,664 --> 00:02:12,484
For the a. But the basic thing is
bias recognition because of, you need

37
00:02:12,484 --> 00:02:15,964
to talk with you need to talk to the
infotainment system or that is the

38
00:02:15,964 --> 00:02:21,634
easiest and more, more fastest way to
communicate with your infotainment system.

39
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:29,539
So in 2020 2020, the the wise accuracy,
it used to be like an 82.4 percentage

40
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:32,804
around around 20 wise commands.

41
00:02:32,864 --> 00:02:35,524
Almost three or two operations.

42
00:02:35,524 --> 00:02:40,004
Operations, like in a wise commands got
failed able to process that command.

43
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:48,849
But in 2023 that increase to 96.2,
right now it's almost 99.99 percentage

44
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:51,514
accuracy of the, of your wise commands.

45
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:56,479
And then the, and the other
thing is the fast response, the

46
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:02,319
responses also very reduced a
right now it's 2.7 seconds to get.

47
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,144
Get your answers whatever you
are asking to the entertainment

48
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,869
system it'll respond like that.

49
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:13,629
And then and then the there are
so many things involved we will

50
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:18,689
get into that things first of all
computational architecture evolution.

51
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,579
So in 2020 in 2080, let's
start with the 20 28, 20 18.

52
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:30,289
So we used to like in automotive
industries, used 1, 2, 2 processing means

53
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:32,509
we call the vehicle interface process.

54
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:33,584
The vehicle is.

55
00:03:33,674 --> 00:03:37,844
Consisting of ecs, electronic
control units, each con, each

56
00:03:37,904 --> 00:03:42,934
ECU consisting of specific set of
operations BC body control module.

57
00:03:42,934 --> 00:03:48,304
It's specifically designed for
braking system or lighting or some

58
00:03:48,304 --> 00:03:50,219
of the most critical operation.

59
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:55,969
And then there are lightning module,
especially for lights, lightning system.

60
00:03:56,029 --> 00:04:01,459
And then there are like, vehicle vehicle
control units and then as well as the like

61
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:03,749
you audio amplifier amplifier modules.

62
00:04:03,749 --> 00:04:05,964
Amplifier modules are like, audio systems.

63
00:04:06,024 --> 00:04:10,174
Those kind of things are like, it's
consisting of the auto, the vehicle

64
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:15,004
is consisting of number of, so
in 20 20 18, it used to be one to

65
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:18,429
two crossing limits, but 2020 we.

66
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:23,059
It increase it to two to four
processing units more demand, more

67
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:26,079
more capabilities are introduced.

68
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:33,819
And then 2023 and 2022 at used it was
like, five to eight processing units.

69
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:38,599
So imagine 5, 2, 8 is 1
trillion operations per second.

70
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:42,939
The whatever the, the five
to eight crossing units.

71
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:45,869
It'll it'll operate 1 trillion operations.

72
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:51,899
And right now we are almost triple
that 3 trillion operations per second.

73
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:56,724
That's how we increased the
capabilities of the operations

74
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,764
and then low power consumption.

75
00:04:58,824 --> 00:05:02,964
That is also another another thing
we need to we need to consider.

76
00:05:03,194 --> 00:05:05,864
All, automotive is first
priority is safety.

77
00:05:06,284 --> 00:05:09,909
Safety is when you are driving your
car safety is the first priority

78
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:11,589
for the automotive industry.

79
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:12,149
That's why.

80
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:15,164
Every automotive industry when
they are implementing any.

81
00:05:15,994 --> 00:05:20,964
Any any capabilities or anything,
the safety is the first reality

82
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,664
for their for their operations.

83
00:05:23,904 --> 00:05:26,704
So that's the that's how they operating.

84
00:05:26,914 --> 00:05:28,244
So let's get into that.

85
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:31,414
Drive driver monitoring
and personalization things.

86
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:39,314
Let's the AI is also uses not only for
your voice recognization, but also camera.

87
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:43,289
So how the, how you are whether you are
sad, whether you are sick, whether you

88
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:48,689
are, based on your eye movements, based
on your facial expressions it'll recognize

89
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:53,629
and then say, based on your command if
you are a dull if you are, if you got into

90
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:58,199
a trouble or anything, it automatically
detect and directly connected to your

91
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:00,294
when you are in got an accident any.

92
00:06:01,164 --> 00:06:07,374
Need anything any, any sudden movements,
it automatically directly connected to

93
00:06:07,374 --> 00:06:12,475
the back office systems, and directly
connected to your 9 1 1 to get get help

94
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:15,545
as possible and then car your incidents.

95
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:20,040
That's how this AI is added those
capabilities and as well as the.

96
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:26,010
I just I just your information like, your
personal information whether it's saved

97
00:06:26,141 --> 00:06:32,166
saved, locally, saved in the back office,
but it's but it's needs to be private.

98
00:06:32,586 --> 00:06:32,646
You.

99
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,031
No, no need to be shared with someone.

100
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:39,201
So that is our sort priority for the ai.

101
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:40,821
And then there is an name.

102
00:06:41,576 --> 00:06:42,536
Neural networks.

103
00:06:42,756 --> 00:06:45,146
That is like analyzing multiple input.

104
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:50,161
You are driving same location
multiple times, and then a, recognize

105
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:52,256
that one and then determine okay.

106
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:56,151
You are going to this one you are
going to this road, and then is

107
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:58,186
there any traffic in that location?

108
00:06:58,191 --> 00:07:01,786
And then it'll give an in
input, like no suggestions.

109
00:07:02,026 --> 00:07:04,886
Oh, hey you are going into this direction.

110
00:07:04,976 --> 00:07:06,241
We have some trouble.

111
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:08,846
We are closing some roads
or something like that.

112
00:07:09,056 --> 00:07:13,661
So then he, then you know you
have any better better things

113
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:15,916
and better schedule in your day.

114
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:20,236
So that's how the, your
your time is saved.

115
00:07:20,236 --> 00:07:25,141
And then you can, you can you can
like in safety of your when you were

116
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:27,256
driving safety is also considered.

117
00:07:27,316 --> 00:07:30,616
And then as, as well as the
driver attention when you are

118
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,956
driving telling me, traffic.

119
00:07:33,006 --> 00:07:35,526
We had you as like something.

120
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,891
Then it'll recognize that.

121
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:40,836
Then think, okay, hey, there is a traffic.

122
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:42,451
You need to be alert.

123
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:44,296
Then you can do that.

124
00:07:44,996 --> 00:07:45,986
That's how, yeah.

125
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:46,951
These things are working.

126
00:07:47,131 --> 00:07:51,361
So let's predicting a and
context context awareness.

127
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:56,811
There are four things we need to be
considered temporal analysis and then

128
00:07:56,811 --> 00:08:00,596
geo pattern intelligence and then
behavioral pattern, the communication

129
00:08:00,616 --> 00:08:02,241
and feedback loop integration.

130
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:05,786
These are designed for a different
different, things like, day after

131
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:09,666
week pattern recognization when you
are when you are particular day, you,

132
00:08:10,146 --> 00:08:14,731
you are doing something like, you are
able to do something, then a, predict

133
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:17,921
that one then give the suggestions.

134
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:22,261
And then there is another thing
like, you were able to you are a AV.

135
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:26,486
Electrical vehicle, your charging
station, recommended charging stations.

136
00:08:26,696 --> 00:08:28,731
It'll give the recommended
charging station.

137
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:34,721
And then audio setting based on your
mood, you can the a give, Hey, I'm

138
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:36,996
going to set up this songs for you.

139
00:08:37,146 --> 00:08:40,521
Whether you agree or
disagree, it's up to you.

140
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:45,961
But yeah it'll give an suggestion and
then behavior pattern based on your

141
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:50,376
mood, based on your your preference
based on your media preference.

142
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:55,906
It'll it'll give an a, like an, okay,
I'm playing this song and looking, okay

143
00:08:56,006 --> 00:08:58,046
I want to play this song, yes or no?

144
00:08:58,226 --> 00:08:58,616
Yes.

145
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:04,031
Yeah, you could it will play then
without your without, much thinking of

146
00:09:04,031 --> 00:09:08,286
your it automatically recognize your
mood and then it'll, and then feedback.

147
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:09,756
Look, that is another thing.

148
00:09:10,126 --> 00:09:14,896
When you are when you are like,
when the a given in suggestion, but

149
00:09:14,896 --> 00:09:16,561
you don't like it, it's okay, but.

150
00:09:17,236 --> 00:09:18,721
It'll why it is rejected.

151
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:22,801
It'll analyze the ai and then
next time, don't repeat that.

152
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:23,731
Mistakes.

153
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:25,806
So that's how it yeah.

154
00:09:26,306 --> 00:09:28,226
This AI is working so.

155
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,911
And then resource
constraints and optimization.

156
00:09:32,211 --> 00:09:36,606
In the automotive industry so there
are hardware limitations and then

157
00:09:36,606 --> 00:09:40,991
power efficiency requirements and body
management and safety critical ation.

158
00:09:41,351 --> 00:09:46,111
So these are the main constraints for
aa advancements right now there are,

159
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:50,571
hardware limitations that like, one of the
core hardware in the automotive industry

160
00:09:50,621 --> 00:09:58,401
it is to it used to be $1,200, but now
it's almost three to $5,000 per need.

161
00:09:58,781 --> 00:10:03,156
So that's how and then the budget
is also very important for the,

162
00:10:04,086 --> 00:10:06,096
and the space restrictions.

163
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:08,371
Also, you need to be small.

164
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:14,442
The electronic control unit, a CU
is must be small, and as well as

165
00:10:14,442 --> 00:10:18,508
the doing more operation, trillions
and trillions of power operation.

166
00:10:18,928 --> 00:10:21,298
And then second thing
is battery efficiency.

167
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:27,283
That in automotive industry EV ranges
question for hey my, my company's

168
00:10:27,403 --> 00:10:30,393
doing six 50 miles per full charge.

169
00:10:30,753 --> 00:10:36,623
A my, my ev is like 300 miles
per full charge within 15

170
00:10:36,623 --> 00:10:37,583
minutes, something like that.

171
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:42,023
No, power efficiency is after
thing we need to consider.

172
00:10:42,383 --> 00:10:44,633
And then memory management then.

173
00:10:44,903 --> 00:10:50,828
So how many operations we are performing
to the users, and then we need to show.

174
00:10:51,003 --> 00:10:56,223
We need to store and then deploy and
then use that, those information, and

175
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:58,123
then give it to the right feedback.

176
00:10:58,393 --> 00:11:01,203
Write write information to the try user.

177
00:11:01,513 --> 00:11:04,483
And then there is safety
critical operation.

178
00:11:04,513 --> 00:11:10,173
That is the that is one of the performance
determin performance guarantees.

179
00:11:10,223 --> 00:11:15,388
Oh, hey, my automotive industry is
doing good with this operations.

180
00:11:15,538 --> 00:11:16,408
Something like that.

181
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:18,298
So that's how it's it's working.

182
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:21,793
And then there are privacy
and data management.

183
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,143
This is another thing.

184
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:27,228
So privacy is the main important
for for our automotive industry.

185
00:11:27,498 --> 00:11:32,448
Whether when you are introducing the a
into the automotive industry, because

186
00:11:32,448 --> 00:11:36,608
of you share your personal data, because
of, you shared your personal data, you

187
00:11:36,608 --> 00:11:39,568
shared your things to the, your car and.

188
00:11:40,303 --> 00:11:42,943
That needs to be stored
somewhere personal.

189
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:47,873
That's how and then there are
different things we need to consider

190
00:11:47,903 --> 00:11:49,543
as an automotive automotive engineer.

191
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:50,693
F first thing is.

192
00:11:51,653 --> 00:11:56,429
And device process only since two
data are stored in locally, like in

193
00:11:56,429 --> 00:12:00,693
your vehicle, and then the remaining
things are like, stored in cloud

194
00:12:00,693 --> 00:12:04,168
services and then reduce the privacy
exposure to the remaining vendors.

195
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,848
And then and the differential privacy.

196
00:12:06,968 --> 00:12:07,508
And then noise.

197
00:12:08,008 --> 00:12:12,928
Transmission and math mathematically
guaranteed individual privacy

198
00:12:12,988 --> 00:12:17,248
while maintaining the static
statistical usefulness document.

199
00:12:17,728 --> 00:12:23,268
These are the things, and then the
federated learning that dis distributes

200
00:12:23,268 --> 00:12:25,038
model training across the vehicle.

201
00:12:25,218 --> 00:12:30,618
Keep the raw data in local, allowing
the fleet wide AI operations without

202
00:12:30,618 --> 00:12:31,968
centralizing the personal data.

203
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:37,248
So time limited storage hey I'm going
to store this data like one month,

204
00:12:37,608 --> 00:12:39,128
three months, something like that.

205
00:12:39,128 --> 00:12:42,538
When you change the, it'll let
automatically delete delete

206
00:12:42,538 --> 00:12:46,288
your data, delete your personal
data, and then keep the vehicle

207
00:12:46,288 --> 00:12:47,968
three without any personal data.

208
00:12:48,178 --> 00:12:49,548
That's how privacy.

209
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:53,363
We are going to introduce to
the automatically systems.

210
00:12:54,183 --> 00:12:55,323
And then safety.

211
00:12:55,823 --> 00:13:00,703
As I mentioned before, automotive
automotive's automotive is first

212
00:13:00,703 --> 00:13:02,883
thing is the safety and distraction.

213
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,543
Distraction mitigation.

214
00:13:04,573 --> 00:13:06,253
So safety is the first priority.

215
00:13:06,303 --> 00:13:08,523
We never, we are implementing anything.

216
00:13:08,523 --> 00:13:10,228
Safety is the first degree reality.

217
00:13:10,728 --> 00:13:13,873
So what are the medications
we are going to?

218
00:13:14,488 --> 00:13:15,778
First thing is workload.

219
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:17,008
Adaptive interfaces.

220
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:21,698
When the when the UI elements based,
standard driving complexity, reducing

221
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:28,458
the car, congregating calculating load
by 43% during hiding, driving situations.

222
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:31,408
And then multimodal interaction design.

223
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:36,648
Whether you are using voice, a touch or
architecture anything it need to be no,

224
00:13:36,678 --> 00:13:39,118
no need to be distract you and driving.

225
00:13:39,788 --> 00:13:40,838
That is another thing.

226
00:13:41,108 --> 00:13:44,063
There are there are couple of
things we need to consider.

227
00:13:44,183 --> 00:13:48,238
Driver must be consultation
on the road without without

228
00:13:48,368 --> 00:13:50,678
doing any further aggressions.

229
00:13:50,728 --> 00:13:52,953
Hey, touching something on
the entertainment system.

230
00:13:53,053 --> 00:13:53,273
No.

231
00:13:53,848 --> 00:13:58,483
We are not doing that one 'cause of,
safety is the first the first ity, and

232
00:13:58,483 --> 00:14:01,303
then attention and avail interruption.

233
00:14:01,353 --> 00:14:06,138
You, if you are talking to Thea, that's
okay if you are like, if you are not

234
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:12,078
concentrating and concentrating not
concentrating on your driving things then

235
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,098
that's the interruption comes into the
picture and then we can notify the driver.

236
00:14:16,098 --> 00:14:16,428
Hey.

237
00:14:16,938 --> 00:14:20,418
We need to be ice on your
road, ice on the road.

238
00:14:20,478 --> 00:14:27,808
So that's how different things mitigation
we are going to implement into that safety

239
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:30,528
structure, destruction, mitigation things.

240
00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:34,008
And then the further thing
is testing and validation as,

241
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,958
how the testing is conducted.

242
00:14:36,498 --> 00:14:42,233
So first thing is we are doing some
basic basic testing the National Highway

243
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:46,393
Traffic Safety at the administration
whatever the guidelines they.

244
00:14:46,448 --> 00:14:47,378
They're provided.

245
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:52,568
We do that some basic things and as
well as the, some of the more generic

246
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:57,683
principles principle verifications, and
then brand specific interaction standards.

247
00:14:58,043 --> 00:15:01,948
And then I. Then there is a
controlled environment test testing.

248
00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:06,878
We are like, we are tested like, only
certain things and then certain behavioral

249
00:15:07,148 --> 00:15:12,398
analysis and then certain task we need
to give to the entertainment system and

250
00:15:12,398 --> 00:15:15,088
then perform do observe the behavior.

251
00:15:15,588 --> 00:15:19,598
And then further we are we are
going to develop that driving

252
00:15:19,598 --> 00:15:25,813
simulator validation that is just
in in just in, in, in house driving.

253
00:15:26,113 --> 00:15:31,133
But you are giving all the feedback to
the AA and then how the reaction time,

254
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:33,433
and then how the it how it is working.

255
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:38,143
And then the third, the fourth phase
is realtime real world validation.

256
00:15:38,473 --> 00:15:43,133
We have in a certain drivers, we
will give the vehicles to the owners.

257
00:15:43,183 --> 00:15:46,303
We call them test fleet
owners, test fleet vehicles.

258
00:15:46,603 --> 00:15:52,193
And then the owners will give an a
complex instruction to the AA and then

259
00:15:52,193 --> 00:15:55,083
how they interacted with that things.

260
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:59,223
And then we can modify, and then we can
rectify those things, and then we can

261
00:15:59,463 --> 00:16:02,873
improve our aa into the info system.

262
00:16:03,183 --> 00:16:05,833
And then future directions
and technical group.

263
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:11,303
So in the future, there are things
need to be considered in our ai.

264
00:16:11,573 --> 00:16:14,493
So first thing is multi
modern, deep deep learning.

265
00:16:14,713 --> 00:16:20,543
Integration of vision, audio and
sensor data and unified AI model

266
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:25,068
AI models, and then autonomous
integration so when you are driving

267
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,638
with hands free, hands, self driving.

268
00:16:27,138 --> 00:16:31,768
So you are, you don't need to
be looking into the road or

269
00:16:31,768 --> 00:16:34,078
some like fully autonomous.

270
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:38,728
You don't need to be, but semi-autonomous,
yes, you need to be sometimes you

271
00:16:38,728 --> 00:16:43,083
don't need to be hands on the wheel
like autonomous, but in that state,

272
00:16:43,183 --> 00:16:48,013
we need to be interacted with that aa
to that autonomous inter interaction.

273
00:16:48,283 --> 00:16:50,873
So we have a better autonomous system.

274
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:53,543
And then AI documentary
reality integration.

275
00:16:53,933 --> 00:16:57,623
So that is that is another thing
like, wind in the windshield.

276
00:16:57,673 --> 00:16:58,873
We can show hey.

277
00:16:59,248 --> 00:17:05,038
This is the information, this is the this
is the weather, this is the speed you

278
00:17:05,073 --> 00:17:10,733
are, this is the, this is the traffic
you are going to, in the, in 15 minutes

279
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:11,963
or 10 minutes, something like that.

280
00:17:11,993 --> 00:17:17,543
And then emotionally based on your mood,
based on your emotional state driver.

281
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:22,888
The AA will give an advice and
responded according to your modes.

282
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:27,953
And then V two X vehicle to everything,
communication, V two vehicle to

283
00:17:27,953 --> 00:17:34,338
network, vehicle to other vehicle to,
a charging area, vehicle to interface.

284
00:17:34,398 --> 00:17:37,988
So this kind of communication
is vehicle to another vehicle.

285
00:17:37,988 --> 00:17:40,933
Vehicle to vehicle is also
another communication.

286
00:17:41,203 --> 00:17:44,053
So how that things are we
need to looking into that one.

287
00:17:44,383 --> 00:17:49,283
So this is how a we we will use into
that automotive industry and then we

288
00:17:49,283 --> 00:17:54,033
will focus more on the deep learning
models and as well as the, how the.

289
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:58,948
A is interacted with infotainment
system and then as well as the

290
00:17:59,448 --> 00:18:03,348
autonomous integration into data
infotainment system will achieve a

291
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:06,798
better and bright automotive systems.

292
00:18:07,098 --> 00:18:09,828
Thank you so much and thank you.
