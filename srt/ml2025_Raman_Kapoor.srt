00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:01,770
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,200
This is Ramin and thank
you for joining me today.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,710
I have 20 years of ID experience
and have been working with

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,230
UKRI as head of Data Platform.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,880
In my past experience, I've worked with
IBM, Southern and Scottish Energies,

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,710
Experian and Scottish Government, and the
kind of projects I have been involved in.

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,750
Cloud migrations, legacy transformations,
machine learning programs, and

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,680
business process automations.

9
00:00:28,335 --> 00:00:32,115
Today we're gonna talk about the blueprint
for the cloud, while building a future

10
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:37,425
ready data strategy to establish a right
data foundation for any AI initiatives.

11
00:00:39,015 --> 00:00:43,215
As we all know, all the industries
today wants to grow faster and in this

12
00:00:43,215 --> 00:00:46,965
highly competitive market, staying
ahead is more critical than ever.

13
00:00:47,235 --> 00:00:50,114
Keeping that in mind, everyone
is jumping towards cloud.

14
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:55,455
Business understands clearly that
it takes huge investment to expand

15
00:00:55,455 --> 00:01:00,255
their own network by keeping
scalability and security on the top.

16
00:01:00,495 --> 00:01:05,355
At the same time, we know that data has
sprouted across legacy system in numerous

17
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:09,435
formats, which is coming through different
sources in the different structures.

18
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:11,810
All together, there is
a pressure of security.

19
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:17,195
Compliance and AI adoption across
all the private and public sectors.

20
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:22,865
The cloud migration without a data
strategy is a risk, big or risk, and

21
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:27,245
it's a huge risk for your initial
investments and the future vision.

22
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:33,455
The cloud adoption is important and it
is accelerating to deliver faster ROI and

23
00:01:33,455 --> 00:01:35,855
expanding access to the global partners.

24
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,950
Let's look at the risks of the cloud
migration when you don't have a clear

25
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,260
data strategies, and what are those risks?

26
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,140
Data silos and inconsistencies.

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,480
Security vulnerabilities, regularities
and compliance failures when you don't

28
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,460
meet the GDPR rules or any kind of
other medical related APA insurance

29
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,960
rules in compatible head performance
due to multi vendors, slower time

30
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,420
to values and delay in the ROIs.

31
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,450
Increased cost due to unknowns.

32
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,900
And no clear strategies from the starting
duplicate systems, even the duplicate data

33
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,120
with the different formats altogether.

34
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,290
Traveling through all of your pipelines,
which you are structuring during your

35
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:25,365
modernizations without structured data
strategies, risks always multiplies and

36
00:02:25,365 --> 00:02:27,870
it doesn't helps you to meet your vision.

37
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,390
Without a clear data strategies and
vision, it is always impossible to

38
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,240
harness the full potential of AI insights.

39
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:41,130
At the same time, we can't ignore
the challenges that comes with

40
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,329
legacy technologies due to their
limited features, rising maintenance

41
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:49,470
cost every year, and lack of
flexibilities when it comes to

42
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,570
scaling or meeting modern security
needs to meet our everyday demands.

43
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:58,589
We should definitely maintain the
inventories of our legacy technologies

44
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:02,940
as part of our clear strategies and
have a very clear path to get rid of

45
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,339
these legacy processes technologies.

46
00:03:05,705 --> 00:03:10,655
As per the roadmap during our migration
journey, what we just need to do is to

47
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:16,325
record every legacy process, which we
believe is need to be changed, but it has

48
00:03:16,325 --> 00:03:19,805
an impact to our cloud migration journey.

49
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:25,055
It can be legacy technologies, ETLs,
it can be legacy integrations, which

50
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:28,415
doesn't have a robust monitorings,
which doesn't have a logging

51
00:03:28,415 --> 00:03:30,875
facilities, which are not resilient.

52
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,359
There can be a different manual data
processes, which needs to be automated.

53
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,019
It can be inconsistent when
the specific data formats.

54
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:44,269
We may have a huge impacts due to
these legacy processes or technologies.

55
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,530
So let's record those impacts
as part of your inventories and

56
00:03:48,649 --> 00:03:50,630
act on these impacts The moment.

57
00:03:51,025 --> 00:03:55,825
You have the right time or as per your
roadmap, based on your defined journey,

58
00:03:56,155 --> 00:04:00,184
based on the critical processes, what
you need to deliver, or what you need

59
00:04:00,184 --> 00:04:05,764
to deploy in the time zone, or maybe
in early stages or in the later stages.

60
00:04:06,274 --> 00:04:11,074
So let's explore how to build the
secure and scalable environment with

61
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:14,854
the right strategy in our mind for
this smooth cloud migration journey.

62
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,269
So let's start with the first
and the most crucial step.

63
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:20,679
Setting up a clear vision.

64
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:22,330
One that's future proof.

65
00:04:22,659 --> 00:04:26,950
Grounded with the strong principles,
and guided by the well-defined goals.

66
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:34,719
Secured by design, having zero trust,
encryptions and auditable policies to

67
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:36,909
validate and verify all the informations.

68
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,749
Scalability with modular pipelines,
cloud native platforms, AI readiness

69
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,549
with a very high quality data.

70
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,169
Data, map data and having
a metadata in place.

71
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,909
The ultimate goal we wanna achieve is to
accelerate the cloud migration journeys

72
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:59,679
with a clear defined data strategies in
place, and having all the inventories

73
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:06,520
in the place eliminate inconsistencies
with all the clear strategies and

74
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,309
unlock innovations through these clear
insights and the data-driven analytics.

75
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:17,604
Let's look at the key pillar of right,
data strategies, data governance.

76
00:05:17,815 --> 00:05:21,445
Let's face it, without strong
data governance, things get messy.

77
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:25,914
It's not just about the rules, it's
about building trust in our data and

78
00:05:25,914 --> 00:05:27,895
making sure everyone is on the same page.

79
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,495
Metadata management is a
heartbeat for the data, which

80
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:33,330
tells the story behind the data.

81
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,870
We don't understand where our data
is coming from or how it's gonna use.

82
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,159
How can we make the smarter decisions
centralized metadata catalog?

83
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,260
Imagine having a single where
everyone can see what this data means

84
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:48,570
and what exactly it's coming from.

85
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,240
This is the power of
centralized metadata catalog.

86
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:56,304
Behaves like a Google engine for your
storage, data, qualities, and lineage.

87
00:05:56,604 --> 00:05:58,614
Good decisions starts with a good data.

88
00:05:58,764 --> 00:06:01,944
And to trust the data, we need to
know where it's coming from, how it's

89
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,984
changing, whether it's reliable or not.

90
00:06:04,134 --> 00:06:05,124
We need to take a call.

91
00:06:05,304 --> 00:06:07,704
That's why quality and lineage matters.

92
00:06:08,155 --> 00:06:10,639
Column level, lineage and impact analysis.

93
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:15,815
Sometimes it's not enough, whether
that is coming from, we need to right.

94
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,480
This kind of details helps us
understand the ripple effect of any

95
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,120
change we make during our pipelines.

96
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,700
So many consistencies across the domains.

97
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,050
It's very simple to use the same
terminologies across the platforms.

98
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,400
It's easy and flexible for the
better collaborations, data

99
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,750
quality engines framework.

100
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,030
Rather than fixing data after the fact,
why don't we building build the checks

101
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:44,590
at the same time from the beginning
itself, which means start updating all

102
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,480
the pipelines from the beginning itself.

103
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,710
Securities and access controls
with great data access comes

104
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,480
the great responsibilities.

105
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,305
We need to make sure the right people have
the right access and the sensitive data.

106
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,640
Cease protectors protected,
always secured by design.

107
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,980
Isn't something we bolt on at the end.

108
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,590
It has to be part of our
design from the day one.

109
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,670
That mindset gives time, money,
and repetitions in the long

110
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,680
run integration framework.

111
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,510
Our system needs to talk to each other
smoothly every day, 24 into seven.

112
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,390
That's why flexible integration frames,
frameworks are the key to flow data

113
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,595
across the platform, tools and teams.

114
00:07:24,995 --> 00:07:29,105
Without any frictions, AI and
analytics enablement from the day

115
00:07:29,105 --> 00:07:31,445
one AI isn't related things anymore.

116
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:36,245
We need to think about enabling AI
and analytics right from the start.

117
00:07:36,335 --> 00:07:39,185
That means setting the right
data foundation today to

118
00:07:39,185 --> 00:07:41,135
unlock insights for tomorrow.

119
00:07:42,135 --> 00:07:45,555
Let's look at the key principles while
building a secure data Foundations

120
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:49,755
zero trust architecture, we don't
automatically trust anything.

121
00:07:49,815 --> 00:07:50,955
Everything gets checked.

122
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:54,795
Instead of just assuming that
things inside our networks are

123
00:07:54,795 --> 00:07:58,515
safe, we need to check everything
from this user perspectives.

124
00:07:58,785 --> 00:08:04,125
Devices and the connections point of
view, it is always safer and smarter

125
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:09,645
way to handle the security encryptions
at the rest and in transitions.

126
00:08:09,915 --> 00:08:13,275
We keep data safe, whether
it is stored or being shared.

127
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,060
At any point of time it needs to be
encrypted, no matter where it is.

128
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:23,100
Identity and access management and
fine grain access controls, people

129
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,990
only get access to what they need.

130
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:25,950
Nothing more.

131
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,930
We manage access carefully.

132
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,090
Not everyone should see everything.

133
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,170
We have to give the right access to the
right persons for the right reasons.

134
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,070
All the times.

135
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,095
Automated compliance audits.

136
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,195
All the times, not once a year.

137
00:08:41,585 --> 00:08:46,445
Instead of waiting for audit, we
must in checks, runs automatically.

138
00:08:46,715 --> 00:08:48,845
So we compliant for all the.

139
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:56,100
Identify legacy inventories, depth
risks, and impacts all the time.

140
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,120
Monitoring and alert dashboards,
look at the problems at the early

141
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,130
stages and fix them fastest.

142
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,600
With the help of these dashboards and
alert systems, we can use dashboards to

143
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,680
keep an eye on the systems in the real
time and enable these alerts to call

144
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,885
out the variances in our shop Locals.

145
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,620
AI and analytics in the
monitoring these days.

146
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:20,520
All the Smart Clouds tools
helps us identifying unusual

147
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,740
behavior and fix it on the go.

148
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:28,980
With ai, we can detect anything like
strange data patterns or unusual behavior.

149
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,960
It helps us act for smart small
issues, funds into the big problems.

150
00:09:36,495 --> 00:09:39,150
It is always important to have
the right data inventories for

151
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,620
your cloud migration journeys.

152
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,760
Inventories may have a different
components like the ETLs and

153
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,550
a p, a platform with different
integrations or different solutions.

154
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,850
There can be numerous manual
processes in the file formats.

155
00:09:50,885 --> 00:09:54,575
Because of different sources altogether,
different data owners may have a

156
00:09:54,575 --> 00:09:57,814
different excess dependencies based
on your different solutions, maybe

157
00:09:57,814 --> 00:09:59,944
power apps or the front end journeys.

158
00:10:00,215 --> 00:10:03,395
We always need to ensure we map
our inventories with the right

159
00:10:03,485 --> 00:10:06,785
data lineage and the critical
parts with the critical systems.

160
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,085
Non in advance.

161
00:10:08,295 --> 00:10:11,505
It's important to identify your
critical systems critical process

162
00:10:11,685 --> 00:10:15,645
for the right operational support
readiness at the start of the journey.

163
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:18,885
Your data catalog and the
metadata is always needs to

164
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,475
aligned to your inventories.

165
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:25,405
For the right production readiness
systems, AI modeling opportunities has

166
00:10:25,405 --> 00:10:27,775
to be identified in the early stages.

167
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:31,645
The clear data models and the
concise model is a key success

168
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:33,145
for the cloud migrations.

169
00:10:34,585 --> 00:10:37,465
For clear strategies, we need
to define the governance and

170
00:10:37,465 --> 00:10:39,205
ownership right from the beginning.

171
00:10:39,565 --> 00:10:43,225
The data keywords and the data
owners rules helps us manage and

172
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,725
take care of the data all the time.

173
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,815
It keeps the data clean,
accurate, and reliable.

174
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:52,285
The data usage policies keeps
preventing, misusing the data and

175
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:53,995
keeps everyone aligned all the times.

176
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:58,315
Data sharing agreements in
those data shared safely and

177
00:10:58,315 --> 00:10:59,485
only for the right reasons.

178
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:03,315
Within the data sharing agreements
within an internal system or the

179
00:11:03,435 --> 00:11:07,545
third party systems, the business
Aries and the metadata tagging helps

180
00:11:07,605 --> 00:11:09,495
everyone understand their data.

181
00:11:09,495 --> 00:11:15,615
Integrities the regulatory alignments
like cprs helps us, follows the data

182
00:11:15,615 --> 00:11:19,425
privacy and the protection laws,
and keeps us legally compliant.

183
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:25,255
The cloud offers, tools and
services through marketplace,

184
00:11:25,525 --> 00:11:28,765
which scales automatically and
makes it easier for the businesses.

185
00:11:29,215 --> 00:11:34,915
The serverless data pipelines like Lambda
Athena enables faster processing with

186
00:11:34,915 --> 00:11:38,755
low cost, without worrying about the
infrastructure cost, and can be scaled.

187
00:11:39,295 --> 00:11:40,885
On demand at any point of time.

188
00:11:41,245 --> 00:11:44,515
The data lake architectures slows
all the data in the raw form.

189
00:11:44,755 --> 00:11:49,345
Makes it easy to access, easy to store
and analyze without the hassle of any

190
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:51,415
predefined data structures in advance.

191
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:56,065
The even driven injections allows
real-time data to flow through different

192
00:11:56,065 --> 00:12:01,225
integration as soon as any even triggers
the containerized workloads provide

193
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:06,325
porta consistent environments to run
and deploy your apps faster in no time.

194
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,770
These steps becomes critical
for our transformation.

195
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:17,530
Discovery and assessment is key critical
process to identify our inventory at

196
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,810
early stages with the right information.

197
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:25,210
Defining governance and security models
helps us defining the rules and standards.

198
00:12:25,695 --> 00:12:30,315
Continue modernizing your ETLs and
APIs with the deployment pipelines.

199
00:12:30,735 --> 00:12:34,635
Start migrating in the phases
by identifying your key critical

200
00:12:34,725 --> 00:12:37,305
processes and operational readiness.

201
00:12:37,755 --> 00:12:41,895
Start enabling AI from the day one
by introducing the data quality

202
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:43,665
frameworks in your pipelines.

203
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,810
In my recent experience, I've been part
of migration project where we had to shift

204
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,090
the legacy systems to the a w solution.

205
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,630
We followed the similar migration
path as we discussed in the

206
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,720
previous slide, and we could see
the outcome without any slippage.

207
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:03,550
We managed to shift all the legacy
APIs to the cloud, hosted A-W-S-A-P-I

208
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,290
gateways, and we could see.

209
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:08,265
APIs are working fine without any issues.

210
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:09,225
Within the right time.

211
00:13:09,645 --> 00:13:16,035
We continu developing our ETLs
with the lamb and the functions

212
00:13:16,305 --> 00:13:20,685
and continued feeding back to the
business for the reporting purpose.

213
00:13:21,015 --> 00:13:25,185
At the same time, we continue replicating
our legacy reporting to the new Power

214
00:13:25,185 --> 00:13:29,755
BI tools and continue deploying this
functionality to the business users.

215
00:13:30,115 --> 00:13:34,195
All I can say, it is important to
have a very clear strategy for your

216
00:13:34,195 --> 00:13:36,505
migrations to reach your goal in time.

217
00:13:36,505 --> 00:13:41,750
I. To summarize, it's important to
have a clear strategy and migration

218
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,210
path for successful migration journey.

219
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:49,100
Investing more time at discovery stages,
accelerate the journey, think beyond

220
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,200
the tools and focus on the outcomes.

221
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,850
Clear strategies helps us link solid
foundations for AI initiatives.

222
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,650
