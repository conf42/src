This roadmap will guide us as we dive
into each topic with plenty of examples

22
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:31,169
and actionable insights along the way.

23
00:01:31,699 --> 00:01:32,639
Let's get started.

24
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,379
In today's session, I'm thrilled
to share insights on how modern web

25
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,189
APIs are transforming the way we
build and enhance web applications.

26
00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:48,399
This presentation is inspired by my
experiences in the e commerce industry.

27
00:01:49,204 --> 00:01:54,654
where I have witnessed firsthand
how APIs like Geolocation, Web

28
00:01:54,654 --> 00:02:00,884
Notifications, and Intersection Observer
can elevate user experiences, increase

29
00:02:00,884 --> 00:02:03,284
conversions, even boost revenue.

30
00:02:04,244 --> 00:02:09,694
Together, we will explore how these
APIs work, why they are valuable, and

31
00:02:09,694 --> 00:02:14,154
how you can leverage them to create
dynamic, interactive web applications.

32
00:02:15,114 --> 00:02:20,149
By the end of this talk, You will
see how using these APIs thoughtfully

33
00:02:20,429 --> 00:02:24,929
can help you bridge the gap between
web and native app functionalities

34
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:30,989
while delivering meaningful, impactful
results for businesses and users alike.

35
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:35,119
Let's begin by understanding
how web APIs have evolved.

36
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:40,079
In the early days, APIs were
simple tools used for basic

37
00:02:40,149 --> 00:02:42,089
tasks like DOM manipulation.

38
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:45,129
Things like dynamically updating text.

39
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:46,849
or hiding elements.

40
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:53,239
But as web development grew more
complex, so did the capabilities of APIs.

41
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:59,099
Today, they allow us to access
advanced features like device hardware,

42
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:05,119
geolocation data, and even offline
functionality, bringing web applications

43
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:07,809
closer to native app experiences.

44
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,579
In a project I worked on for a
major retailer, We used modern web

45
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:18,639
APIs to provide real time inventory
updates for online shoppers.

46
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:25,649
This ensured that users always saw
accurate availability even during high

47
00:03:25,649 --> 00:03:28,569
traffic sale events like Black Friday.

48
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:34,619
The results, a 15 percent
reduction in car abandonment and

49
00:03:34,619 --> 00:03:36,539
a 10 percent boost in revenue.

50
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,859
These advancements also paved the
way for progressive web apps, also

51
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:47,679
known as PWAs, which combine the
best of web and mobile experiences.

52
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:53,239
PWAs are reliable, installable, and
incredibly engaging, making them a

53
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:55,229
key trend in modern web development.

54
00:03:55,729 --> 00:04:00,529
Now let's dive into our first
API, the geolocation API.

55
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:05,849
Geolocation API allows web
applications to access a user's

56
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:09,039
location, provided they give consent.

57
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:13,799
This opens up a world of possibilities
for creating personalized,

58
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:18,509
location based experiences
that feel intuitive and useful.

59
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:22,959
Let's explore some use cases to
see their practical applications.

60
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:28,129
Helping users find nearby
stores with in stock products.

61
00:04:28,924 --> 00:04:35,074
Offering location-based promotions like
discounts for in-store visits, providing

62
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:41,644
tailored recommendations such as local
event tickets or region specific products.

63
00:04:42,144 --> 00:04:48,204
For an outdoor care retailer, we use the
GL location API, to provide users with

64
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:53,394
hiking care recommendations based on their
current location and the local weather.

65
00:04:54,204 --> 00:04:56,154
This not only boosted engagement.

66
00:04:56,509 --> 00:05:02,779
But also increased conversion rate by 20
percent as users felt the recommendations

67
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:05,239
were highly relevant to their needs.

68
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:10,609
This API is not just about
functionality, it's about creating a

69
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:15,219
connection between the user and the
experience by making it more relevant.

70
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:20,619
While the Geolocation API offers
incredible benefits, it also

71
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:22,359
comes with responsibilities.

72
00:05:22,859 --> 00:05:24,649
Best practices to consider.

73
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:28,729
Always explain why you
need the user's location.

74
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:34,719
For instance, a simple message like,
We use your location to show nearby

75
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:38,469
store inventory can help opt ins by 30%.

76
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:45,359
Use encrypted connections to protect user
data and avoid storing it unnecessarily.

77
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,259
Provide alternatives.

78
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,189
like allowing users to enter
their zip code manually.

79
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:57,689
In one project, this simple addition
retained 15 percent of users who

80
00:05:57,719 --> 00:05:59,839
initially denied location access.

81
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:05,069
By adhering to these practices, you
can ensure that your implementation

82
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:09,399
not only delivers value, but
also respects users trust.

83
00:06:10,249 --> 00:06:17,589
Next up, in API, which is all about re
engaging users, you'll This API lets you

84
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,309
send notifications to users even when
they are not actually browsing your site.

85
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:28,259
It's a powerful tool for
boosting engagement and driving

86
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:30,039
traffic back to your platform.

87
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:36,969
Some e commerce use cases are sending
price drop alerts for wishlist items,

88
00:06:37,609 --> 00:06:43,339
notifying users about flash sales,
Our limited time offers reminding

89
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:49,089
customers about items left in their
cart for a holiday sale campaign.

90
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:55,629
We use this API to notify users when
items on their wishlist went on sale.

91
00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:02,229
The personalized approach led to a 25%
click through rate and contributed towards

92
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:04,509
incremental revenue during the season.

93
00:07:05,264 --> 00:07:07,514
Notifications like these
are highly effective.

94
00:07:08,299 --> 00:07:12,129
because they tap into user intent
and drive immediate action.

95
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:18,719
While notifications are effective,
they can become intrusive if overused.

96
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:22,039
Here are a few strategies for success.

97
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:28,409
Let users set preferences for the type
and frequency of notifications they

98
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:30,749
want to receive through customization.

99
00:07:31,604 --> 00:07:37,374
Use analytics to send notifications
at times when users are most likely to

100
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:40,564
engage, such as lunch breaks or evenings.

101
00:07:41,064 --> 00:07:45,114
Limit notifications to three
per day to prevent fatigue.

102
00:07:45,644 --> 00:07:52,594
In one project, implementing frequency
caps Reduced opt out rates by 15%.

103
00:07:53,094 --> 00:07:59,324
An abandoned cart notification sent
24 hours after browsing recovered

104
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:04,154
18 percent of carts, contributing
to an additional revenue in sales.

105
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:09,604
Timing and relevance are critical for
maintaining a positive user experience.

106
00:08:10,304 --> 00:08:15,174
The Intersection Observer API is
all about optimizing performance

107
00:08:15,354 --> 00:08:17,264
and enhancing interactivity.

108
00:08:17,274 --> 00:08:17,334
Thank you.

109
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:23,469
This API tracks when elements enter
or leave the viewport, allowing

110
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:29,539
developers to trigger actions like lazy
loading images or starting animations.

111
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:35,589
For instance, we can lazy load
images for faster page load times.

112
00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:41,179
Also, trigger animations as users
scroll through product categories.

113
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,579
For a fashion retailer, we implemented
lazy loading using this API.

114
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:52,149
It reduced page load times by 35
percent, which directly increased

115
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:54,539
mobile conversion rate by 12 percent.

116
00:08:55,249 --> 00:08:59,499
Improving performance not only
enhances the user experience, but

117
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:01,819
also drives tangible business outcome.

118
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:06,309
The real power of APIs
lies in combining them.

119
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:14,284
In one project, We combined Geolocation
API to identify users near physical

120
00:09:14,384 --> 00:09:20,724
stores, Web Notifications API to
alert them about in store promotions,

121
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:26,574
Intersection Observer API to animate
banners highlighting these deals.

122
00:09:27,204 --> 00:09:31,724
This integration drove a 30 percent
increase in foot traffic and a

123
00:09:31,724 --> 00:09:34,204
20 percent rise in local sales.

124
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:38,044
The synergy between APIs
creates experiences.

125
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:43,759
That are both functional and delightful
some challenges and their solutions

126
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:50,049
Integrating multiple apis can be
challenging browser compatibility Is a

00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:09,399
and caching strategies should help you
with overcoming performance overhead.

130
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:15,399
By adopting modular architecture
and efficient caching, we resolved

131
00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:20,389
these challenges in a global e
commerce project, ensuring consistent

132
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:23,109
