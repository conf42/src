1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:00,889
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:00,889 --> 00:00:01,970
My name is Brian Ish.

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,300
I'm an engineering lead at Ditto.

4
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,199
And I'll be talking today about
Sky Computing charting a new

5
00:00:06,199 --> 00:00:07,759
course in AI cloud infrastructure.

6
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,309
First of all, apologies, this
will be my first time using OBS.

7
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:13,940
And so if there are some technical
glitches, I apologize for that.

8
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,240
But let's get started.

9
00:00:15,739 --> 00:00:16,790
So my name is Brian.

10
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:20,130
As I said, I'm an engineering lead
at Ditto currently spent the last

11
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,380
seven or eight years as an SRE.

12
00:00:23,334 --> 00:00:27,474
Doing production ber workloads at
super orbital raincoat and bayfair.

13
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:32,135
And I have two total decades of
experience going back to 2005.

14
00:00:32,635 --> 00:00:37,535
I wanted to talk first about what
the cloud has meant to us and what

15
00:00:38,045 --> 00:00:41,755
kinda the promises that it's made
over the course of its lifetime here.

16
00:00:42,295 --> 00:00:45,665
We've been promised on demand,
scalability pay as you go, pricing

17
00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:47,885
models near instant global reach.

18
00:00:48,185 --> 00:00:49,505
They've achieved all of these things.

19
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:51,685
They've made, they've kept those promises.

20
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:56,995
I say they, it's a concept but
it's not without it's drawbacks.

21
00:00:57,205 --> 00:00:59,725
So I wanted to draw
attention to some of them.

22
00:00:59,755 --> 00:01:00,685
Vendor lockin.

23
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:02,885
We all know how difficult it can be to.

24
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,660
In practice, be cloud agnostic.

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,320
Data gravity is another concern and
I'll talk about that more later.

26
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:15,210
And we all know egress charges can be a
huge shock in your AWS bill, for instance.

27
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,360
How expensive hosting in the cloud
can be can be very eye-opening for a

28
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,130
lot of organizations out in the world.

29
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,780
I think this what, this is
what has led to a lot of.

30
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,490
Repatriation.

31
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,930
And what do I mean by that?

32
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:36,020
There's a quote from an article I read
that was 42% of organizations surveyed

33
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,190
in the United States are considering
or have already moved at least half

34
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:44,690
of their cloud-based workloads back
to on-premise infrastructures, a

35
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,580
phenomenon known as Cloud repatriation.

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,080
I thought that was very interesting
and I wanted to make a note of that

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,805
and say something about that and.

38
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,699
While I applaud what these
companies are doing from a pragmatic

39
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:01,719
viewpoint on their infrastructure
costs, it does beg a question.

40
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:07,179
Did these companies meticulously
plan their cloud usage from the start

41
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,579
with cop cost optimization in mind,
or are they really just reacting

42
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:15,965
to the unexpected high AWS bill
they got at the end of the month?

43
00:02:16,465 --> 00:02:20,245
I think most evidence points to the
latter companies that are now repatriating

44
00:02:20,245 --> 00:02:24,325
their infrastructure often failed to
implement basic cloud cost controls from

45
00:02:24,325 --> 00:02:27,805
day one, like automatically shutting
down dev environments during off hours,

46
00:02:27,805 --> 00:02:32,185
using spot instances for batch workloads
or implementing resource quotas.

47
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:35,845
So rather than fixing those
foundational issues, they've chosen

48
00:02:35,845 --> 00:02:38,515
to abandon the cloud completely
and that's their decision.

49
00:02:38,885 --> 00:02:43,204
But I think taking a step back to on-prem
might not truly be a step forward.

50
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,060
In the long run, if we remain in
the cloud though, how do we address

51
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,170
the fundamental challenges of vendor
lock-in data gravity and rising costs

52
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,250
in a transformative way, rather than
just applying incremental fixes?

53
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,370
And this is where I want to start talking
about the concept of sky computing.

54
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,740
So Sky Computing has been around since Ian
Stoica and Ian, and I apologize if I've.

55
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,270
Mispronounced your last name.

56
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,270
Since 2021 he published where when
he published his very notable paper.

57
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,490
And I very much encourage
everyone to go read it.

58
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,510
It's not a very long read.

59
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,900
I believe it's 20 or so pages.

60
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:22,039
And it really gets to the
heart of the problem and what

61
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,269
he believes the solution is.

62
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:24,319
And I think he's spot on.

63
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:29,099
I'll be talking more about it in, in
the future slides here, but, just as

64
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:33,879
a general overview, workloads flow
seamlessly between cloud providers.

65
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:38,209
Therefore they are free from
vendor lock-in and inefficiencies.

66
00:03:38,749 --> 00:03:43,819
And you as the operator have much
better control over data governance.

67
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:47,189
And these are very big issues,
especially for enterprise.

68
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:52,140
So the three pillars that I've coined, and
these are my pillars that, these are not

69
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,360
official or written in Ian's paper at all.

70
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,030
But these are what I've dwid it down to.

71
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,810
And that is pillar one being abstraction.

72
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,019
At the heart, oh, sorry.

73
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:04,459
Moving ahead there too fast.

74
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,890
At the heart of Sky Computing lies
abstraction, which serves as the

75
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:12,409
glue that unifies the disparate
cloud platforms through compatibility

76
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:16,669
layer, leveraging tools like
Kubernetes Ray and standardized APIs.

77
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:21,060
Like S3 sky Computing hides the
complexities of individual clouds.

78
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,650
This means you won't need to worry about
whether your data sits in AWS S3 or Azure

79
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,990
Blob storage, the abstraction layer.

80
00:04:28,304 --> 00:04:30,044
This one handles those details.

81
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:35,280
Deciding on the optimal storage base
storage base and cost and performance

82
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,509
based on cost and performance.

83
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:36,809
Sorry.

84
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:41,139
By providing a right once run
anywhere experience abstraction,

85
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:43,809
eliminates a vendor lock-in and
simplifies application deployment.

86
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:47,949
As more cloud platforms become supported,
the abstraction layer offers greater

87
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:51,549
flexibility, enabling smoother transitions
and substantial cost savings without

88
00:04:51,549 --> 00:04:55,509
requiring you to change how you develop
or how you manage your workloads.

89
00:04:56,484 --> 00:05:01,074
Even beyond the hyper cloud providers of
today, like A-W-S-G-C-P and Azure, you'll

90
00:05:01,074 --> 00:05:05,364
see support for neo cloud providers like
Lambda Labs Core Weave or nes, providing

91
00:05:05,364 --> 00:05:07,434
even greater operational flexibility.

92
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:11,104
Pillar two here I have is automation
and building on the foundations of

93
00:05:11,104 --> 00:05:14,909
abstraction automation is the really the
next pillar driving sky computing forward.

94
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:18,479
InterCloud brokers embody this
pillar by serving as intelligent

95
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,049
decision makers who manage workload
placement, cost optimization, and

96
00:05:22,049 --> 00:05:23,669
compliance across multiple clouds.

97
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:27,879
These brokers continuously analyze
factors like pricing, resource

98
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:31,299
availability, and regulatory
requirements using AI and realtime data.

99
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:34,974
They automatically route or adjust
workloads based on current conditions.

100
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:38,419
Ensuring your applications always
run in the most cost effective

101
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:39,679
and efficient environment.

102
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:43,219
This removes the manual overhead of
juggling multiple cloud providers,

103
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:46,549
reduces the chance of human error,
and lets you focus on higher level

104
00:05:46,549 --> 00:05:49,609
tasks while the system optimizes
operations behind the scenes.

105
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:54,029
This is perhaps the largest pillar, by
the way and the hardest to get right.

106
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:56,929
Third and last pillar here I
wanna talk about is agility.

107
00:05:57,429 --> 00:06:01,599
Agility is about creating responsive
and flexible cloud ecosystem where

108
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:03,519
data and workloads can move freely.

109
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:07,609
Reciprocal reciprocal peering
agreements are key to this agility

110
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:10,279
and you'll see me mention this a
couple of times in the presentation.

111
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:14,459
These agreements are collaborations
between cloud providers that allow

112
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:19,439
for free or low cost data transfers,
or discounted data transfers,

113
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:22,409
breaking down the barriers such
as egress fees and data gravity.

114
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:26,359
As these agreements take shape, often
organically driven by hyperscale

115
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:31,549
providers keen to support popular brokers
serving the automation layer workloads

116
00:06:31,549 --> 00:06:33,259
can move seamlessly between clouds.

117
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:36,649
This dynamic environment empowers
businesses to adapt quickly to shifting

118
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:41,159
costs, regulatory changes or performance
performance requirements without

119
00:06:41,164 --> 00:06:42,364
being locked into a single provider.

120
00:06:42,864 --> 00:06:46,194
Crucially, this level of agility
opens up the cloud ecosystem in

121
00:06:46,194 --> 00:06:50,004
ways never but seen before by
tearing down silos and encouraging

122
00:06:50,004 --> 00:06:51,684
collaboration between providers.

123
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:55,854
Sky computing creates an interconnected
landscape where innovation thrives

124
00:06:56,484 --> 00:06:57,924
smaller and more specialized.

125
00:06:57,924 --> 00:07:01,314
Neo cloud providers, like Land
Lambda Labs, for instance, or run

126
00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:05,134
pod they gain a seat at the table,
fostering competition and driving

127
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:06,574
breakthroughs and service offerings.

128
00:07:07,264 --> 00:07:11,104
Enterprises can mix and match services
from various providers without fear.

129
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:14,449
Leveraging the best features from
each platform to suit their needs.

130
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:19,399
The result is an agile infrastructure
that can pivot on demand, offering both

131
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:23,839
resilience and the flexibility to innovate
and disrupt rather than just iterate.

132
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:28,789
This unprecedented openness not only
breaks the barriers of vendor lock-in, but

133
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:32,419
also sparks a whole new era of creativity
and efficiency across the entire cloud.

134
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:35,809
Indu, cloud industry, fundamentally
changing how businesses

135
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:37,129
harness cloud technology.

136
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:40,569
Sky Pilot here is the
inaugural broker framework.

137
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:44,429
And the third bullet point here, this
is encompassing the automation pillar

138
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:48,770
that I just spoke about before and
the central pillar it was developed

139
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,479
by uc, Berkeley Sky Computing Lab.

140
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:52,310
They're the creators of Spark and Ray.

141
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,469
It is also, by the way, the residency
of Ian Deca, author of that paper.

142
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,379
It is an open source InterCloud
broker framework implementing

143
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,580
Sky Computing principles.

144
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,540
They have over a million
downloads as of July, 2025.

145
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,850
They're on version zero point 10
including enterprise features.

146
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:14,240
They have a unified interface to 17
clouds plus Kubernetes plus on-prem.

147
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:19,160
And there are key capabilities here,
three to six times cost savings

148
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,230
through spot orchestration alone.

149
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,220
Four x faster provisioning.

150
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,110
You can get 200 GPUs in
less than 90 seconds.

151
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,660
9.6 x faster checkpointing
with Mount cached.

152
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,570
Zero code changes for
existing ML workloads.

153
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,760
And you have one yamo file and one
command to run Sky Launch Cloud.

154
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,030
Any.

155
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,850
Now what kind of impact does this have?

156
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,170
This is ML lops, after all.

157
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:46,785
What kind of impact does this have on
workload impacts or ML workloads rather?

158
00:08:47,715 --> 00:08:50,615
And I wanna reference a couple
of case studies that were

159
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:52,055
written by these companies.

160
00:08:52,055 --> 00:08:56,475
They're, and they're available on the
sky Compute, or, sorry, sky Pilot website

161
00:08:56,695 --> 00:08:58,075
which I'll have a link to shortly.

162
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:01,765
But there are two case studies
that were of particular interest

163
00:09:01,765 --> 00:09:02,845
that I wanted to bring up here.

164
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,360
A bridge.

165
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,450
There, they were a slum shop running
their AI infrastructure on s slm.

166
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,710
And I found this quote in their case
study from one of their research

167
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:17,080
scientists that I thought, I, I have
to include this in the presentation.

168
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,860
I thought that was pretty great.

169
00:09:18,655 --> 00:09:19,765
And covalent as well.

170
00:09:19,915 --> 00:09:26,855
They built a whole new AI stack and really
combating the scarcity in GPUs that I'm

171
00:09:26,855 --> 00:09:28,665
sure everyone is aware of these days.

172
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:33,415
But you can go on Sky sky Pilot's website,
sky Pilot, I believe it's Sky pilot.co.

173
00:09:33,915 --> 00:09:38,305
And this one I wanna go into more details
about the Abridge case study and bring

174
00:09:38,305 --> 00:09:41,695
some things further into this presentation
that I thought were very interesting.

175
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:45,075
Sky Pilot delivered, and this, these
are their words, by the way, not mine.

176
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:47,905
Sky Pilot delivered the familiar
experience our researchers

177
00:09:47,905 --> 00:09:49,075
wanted with the reliability.

178
00:09:49,075 --> 00:09:50,695
Our production workloads required.

179
00:09:51,195 --> 00:09:56,985
With interactive development, you can run
Sky Launch dash GPUs, H 100, colon four,

180
00:09:57,195 --> 00:10:01,665
which provides immediate SSH access to A
GPU enabled shell without complex setup.

181
00:10:02,505 --> 00:10:07,785
Just S Run Dash dashs equals GPU
colon four dash PT y Bash and

182
00:10:07,785 --> 00:10:11,145
S slm, but it works seamlessly
across all of our infrastructure.

183
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:12,635
Jupyter Notebook hosting.

184
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:16,385
We can spin up Jupyter Notebooks
directly on GPU clusters, enabling

185
00:10:16,385 --> 00:10:19,925
researchers to prototype with high-end
hardware that wasn't available locally.

186
00:10:20,425 --> 00:10:24,265
Sky Pilots manage jobs, provide the same
convenience as SLMs job scheduler, but

187
00:10:24,265 --> 00:10:25,855
works across all of our infrastructure.

188
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:29,845
Automatic restart on job failures,
strong isolation and reliable job

189
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:31,615
management for long running training jobs.

190
00:10:32,115 --> 00:10:33,045
And model evals.

191
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:35,325
Quick model evaluation becomes simple.

192
00:10:35,775 --> 00:10:39,135
We can deploy models as fast API
services in minutes for testing.

193
00:10:39,435 --> 00:10:42,795
Unlike lm, which lacks native API
endpoint support, sky Pilot makes it

194
00:10:42,795 --> 00:10:45,135
easy to expose models as services.

195
00:10:45,635 --> 00:10:48,455
This is one of their examples
from their case study.

196
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:53,660
This is a Ya the entire YAMA file for
running distributed training on Sky Pilot.

197
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,210
Not complex at all.

198
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,480
Researchers can use pure PyTorch
and hugging face without wrappers

199
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,860
or additional abstraction layers.

200
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,280
Sky Pilot seamlessly sets up multiple
nodes, populates environment variables

201
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,430
with a cluster topology information
like number of nodes, GPUs, IP

202
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,590
addresses, and then kicks off the jobs.

203
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,370
It's a huge win since machine learning
engineers don't need to struggle with

204
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,880
scaffolding for distributor training,
and it works with any package manager.

205
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:25,050
So when it comes to AI and ML workloads,
different stages of a pipeline may

206
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,600
benefit from different cloud providers
Specialties and this is where sky

207
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,680
computing really becomes interesting.

208
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:36,190
With an InterCloud broker like Sky
Pilot, you can split your pipeline and

209
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,170
run model training on Google Cloud.

210
00:11:38,485 --> 00:11:42,895
With TPU optimized instances for deep
learning then decide to run inference on

211
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:48,135
AWS with their in chips for lower latency
and your data pre-processing on Azure.

212
00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:49,685
Why would you do this?

213
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:54,950
For one, speed and efficiency of the
machines that I say it I mentioned above.

214
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,255
Cost savings Azure oftentimes
is much cheaper than a AWS.

215
00:12:00,755 --> 00:12:02,255
And regional data regulations.

216
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:06,035
Again, going back to your data
governance for compliance purposes,

217
00:12:06,035 --> 00:12:07,505
this is huge for organizations.

218
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:10,615
So what's preventing sky computing
from becoming ubiquitous?

219
00:12:11,045 --> 00:12:14,075
These are some of the challenges
that I foresee personally.

220
00:12:14,575 --> 00:12:16,945
Standard standardization is a huge one.

221
00:12:17,585 --> 00:12:21,675
Universal standards across all cloud
platforms is unlikely Due to competitive

222
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:26,925
interests and proprietary technologies,
progress can still be made by leveraging

223
00:12:26,925 --> 00:12:31,155
existing widely adopted tools such
as Kubernetes, Ray and S3 APIs.

224
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:34,655
These standards don't cover every
scenario, but they provide a practical

225
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:37,715
bridge, allowing sky computing to
move forward without waiting for

226
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,785
complete industry-wide uniformity.

227
00:12:40,285 --> 00:12:41,935
Another challenge is economic resistance.

228
00:12:42,175 --> 00:12:47,005
Hyperscalers will resist reciprocal
peering agreements as sharing

229
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:50,275
data freely between platforms can
conflict with their business models.

230
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:54,385
While this resistance exists, smaller
cloud providers and innovative

231
00:12:54,385 --> 00:12:58,835
startups have strong incentives to
embrace sky computing principles.

232
00:12:59,335 --> 00:13:03,235
Their agility and the desire to
compete with larger players drive

233
00:13:03,235 --> 00:13:06,865
them to support the ecosystem
gradually encouraging wider adoption

234
00:13:06,865 --> 00:13:10,315
and putting pressure on the bigger
providers to reconsider their stance.

235
00:13:10,815 --> 00:13:13,805
Infrastructure inertia
is a very big topic here.

236
00:13:13,905 --> 00:13:15,345
There are significant investments.

237
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,550
Preexisting investments organizations
have already heavily invested in

238
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,140
existing cloud infrastructure.

239
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,710
Not just cost, but expertise,
tooling and processing or

240
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:29,430
processes leading to hesitation
and dramatic changes such as this.

241
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,550
There's resistance to
new paradigms, right?

242
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,200
That's gonna be the case
every time there's a new one.

243
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,780
Reluctance to adopt new paradigms
like sky computing due to

244
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,250
lack of widespread adoption.

245
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,890
Good enough status quo.

246
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:44,040
Current cloud deployments often function
adequately, even if they're not, cost

247
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,720
optimized or performance optimized.

248
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,940
And there is daunting overhead concerns
about retraining staff, updating

249
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,670
deployment pipelines and refactoring
applications for sky computing's

250
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:56,685
abstraction layer perceived risks,
apprehensions regarding reliability

251
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,200
and support when moving away
from established cloud providers.

252
00:13:59,545 --> 00:14:00,505
Negative services.

253
00:14:00,595 --> 00:14:05,945
Moving on to something like Run Pod or
Lambda Labs, that is not as proven as AWS.

254
00:14:06,005 --> 00:14:09,595
Nothing is gonna be as proven as
AWS, but and so these factors create

255
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:13,935
substantial inertia, hindering
widespread sky sky computing adoption.

256
00:14:14,435 --> 00:14:18,095
Finally, I wanna speak about the
challenge of legitimacy, and this is

257
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:21,950
maybe an understated one, but deserves
a mention here at the very least.

258
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,810
The concept of sky computing faces
challenges in establishing legitimacy,

259
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,680
partly due to a Wikipedia entry
with a warning banner, questioning

260
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,980
source reliability, and noting
a lack of academic citations.

261
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,480
This stems from an incident where a
commercial entity attempted to shape

262
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,140
the narrative around sky computing
through Wikipedia editing, leading

263
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,460
to their ban from the platform.

264
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,940
This incident highlights
a broader challenge.

265
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,820
Commercial entities sometimes
try to claim thought leadership.

266
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,460
For emerging technologies through
questionable means, inadvertently

267
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,670
damaging the credibility of
legitimate technological advances.

268
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,800
However, the fundamental value proposition
of Sky Computing providing a unified

269
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,610
interface across cloud providers
while optimizing cost, performance,

270
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:05,630
and compliance stands independent of
any single company's implementation.

271
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,750
So for final thoughts, I wanted to say
I genuinely believe that we're at a

272
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,610
turning point in cloud infrastructure.

273
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,180
I don't think sky computing
is just another buzzword here.

274
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,090
I think it's a practical
fix for real problems.

275
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,900
It brings together different cloud
services into one smooth system,

276
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,200
making life easier for businesses
and SREs who need reliable,

277
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,120
flexible, and efficient operations.

278
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,570
At the end of the day, this makes
a sizable dent and balance sheets.

279
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,710
That's what matters.

280
00:15:31,295 --> 00:15:34,385
As more sky computing solutions
emerge, tech leaders worldwide will

281
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:37,135
continue to notice they'll see the
benefits and quickly move their

282
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:40,975
workloads to these smarter, more open
and more cost-effective cloud setups.

283
00:15:41,665 --> 00:15:44,215
The future of the cloud is
here knocking at our door.

284
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:48,775
It's an exciting moment to rethink how we
build and manage systems that stand up to

285
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:54,025
real world demands, more resilient, more
adaptable, and ready for what's next.

286
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:55,305
Thank you very much.
