00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,060
Hi, I'm Ajita Bona Chandran, and
I'm a PRI principal machine learning

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,090
and a generative AI engineer
in our leading investment firm.

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,869
Thank you so much for giving me this
opportunity to present my topic.

4
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:16,400
In this conference, I'll be taking the
next 15 to 20 minutes to talk about

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:21,080
agent search, powering next generation
insights using multi-agent intelligence.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,779
Let's consider a typical
enterprise scenario.

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,070
Maybe there's a financial
organization that manages multiple

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,509
terabytes of operational data.

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,640
A senior decision maker requires
analysis of declining mobile banking

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,570
satisfaction metrics, and strategic
recommendations for improvement.

11
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,760
Traditional search systems return
thousands of potentially relevant

12
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,575
documents requiring extensive manual
review to extract actionable insights.

13
00:00:48,165 --> 00:00:51,670
This process typically requires
several days and may result

14
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,900
in incomplete analysis.

15
00:00:53,605 --> 00:00:58,075
Agent search system offer an alternative
approach, comprehensive analysis

16
00:00:58,075 --> 00:01:02,185
delivered within minutes, incorporating
trend identification, competitive

17
00:01:02,185 --> 00:01:06,415
benchmarking, root cause analysis,
and strategic recommendations through

18
00:01:06,415 --> 00:01:08,365
coordinated multi-agent intelligence.

19
00:01:08,905 --> 00:01:12,475
Today I will demonstrate how JavaScripts
architectural characteristics

20
00:01:12,475 --> 00:01:15,985
position it as an optimal platform
for implementing these systems.

21
00:01:16,485 --> 00:01:18,550
Let's talk a bit about the search problem.

22
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,180
Before that, let's quickly
see what the agenda is.

23
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,900
We will understand what the search problem
is, and then we will briefly talk about

24
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,880
evolution of various search paradigms.

25
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,540
We will also talk about the agent,
multi-agent architecture, which is the

26
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,350
topic of the day and how JavaScript
implementation works in this case.

27
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,510
We'll also talk a little bit
about real world impact and future

28
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,210
considerations that you can take
away from this particular session.

29
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,140
So what is the search
problem that we face today?

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,930
Enterprise data volumes have expanded
exponentially with many organizations

31
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,780
managing Pega bytes of structured
and unstructured information.

32
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,510
However, traditional keyword based
search systems remain functionally

33
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,165
limited in their ability to transform
this data into actionable intelligence.

34
00:02:01,665 --> 00:02:05,475
Current search paradigms operate
on lexical matching principles

35
00:02:05,535 --> 00:02:08,835
designed for document retriable
rather than inside generation.

36
00:02:09,585 --> 00:02:13,245
When executors require complex
analytical responses, these systems

37
00:02:13,335 --> 00:02:18,735
return document collections that further
require extensive human interpretation

38
00:02:18,735 --> 00:02:20,475
to derive meaningful conclusions.

39
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:23,720
Research indicates that knowledge
workers spent approximately

40
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,645
half of the day looking for
information on searching for them.

41
00:02:26,945 --> 00:02:32,105
And maybe only 50 to 60 per 60% of
these searches yield relevant results.

42
00:02:32,915 --> 00:02:37,145
The financial impact in this case is
significant, delayed strategic decisions,

43
00:02:37,175 --> 00:02:41,000
missed market opportunities, and
inefficient res resource allocation.

44
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,360
The fundamental issue here
is very architectural.

45
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,590
Traditional search systems are
designed for information location,

46
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,480
not intelligence synthesis.

47
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,960
The enterprise requirements have
evolved beyond document matching

48
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,160
towards comprehensive analysis,
prediction, and strategy recommendation.

49
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,870
Let's talk a little bit briefly
about evolution of search paradigms.

50
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,350
The first one is keyword search.

51
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,240
Keyword search operates like we
spoke about lexical pattern matching

52
00:03:08,245 --> 00:03:09,235
and term frequency analysis.

53
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:16,010
This approach delivers documents based
solely on literal word presence, often

54
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,850
producing high volumes of irrelevant
results with very limited precision.

55
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,790
The second generation is semantic search.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,370
Semantic search represents a significant
advancement actually achieving contextual

57
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,230
comprehension through natural language.

58
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:35,240
Understanding these systems interpret
meaning and intent, driving conceptually

59
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,610
relevant results with substantially
reduced irrelevant content.

60
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,620
The third generation is the topic that
we are talking about agentic search.

61
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,520
It constitutes a paradigm
shift from passive retrival to

62
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,960
active intelligence generation.

63
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,400
These systems deploy specialized AI agents
that understand the problem structure,

64
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:56,470
plan investigations, and synthesize
findings into decision ready intelligence.

65
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,470
So now let's talk briefly
about what is agent search.

66
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:06,050
Like we spoke, this is a fundamentally a
paradigm shift from traditional approaches

67
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,980
through several key capabilities,
collaborative processing through multiple

68
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,390
specialized agents coordinating to handle
different aspects of complex queries,

69
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,040
semantic understanding, providing deep
comprehen comprehension of the query

70
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,650
intent beyond just keyboard matching.

71
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:26,010
Synthesis generation, transforming
this raw information into actionable

72
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,420
insights and quality assurance through
systematic validation of the findings

73
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,980
through multi-agent verification.

74
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,270
Let's maybe demonstrate all these
capabilities with some practical examples.

75
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,920
Let's consider a business query.

76
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:38,490
Why?

77
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,725
Why has the mobile banking
satisfaction declined over the past?

78
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:46,545
Keyword search might require, may return,
maybe a thousand documents containing all

79
00:04:46,545 --> 00:04:48,165
the words that are there in the question.

80
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,865
Mobile banking satisfaction and decline.

81
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:55,185
This includes irrelevant content
such as mobile phone banking,

82
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:56,385
hardware specifications.

83
00:04:56,415 --> 00:05:00,135
User would receive quarterly reports,
customer service transcripts,

84
00:05:00,135 --> 00:05:02,780
market materials, and so much of I.

85
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,955
Relevant documents that request, manual
review, man has to go through all the

86
00:05:06,955 --> 00:05:08,485
hundreds of documents that has been.

87
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,200
Returned to extract relevant insights.

88
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,170
This analysis might take
maybe a week or even more.

89
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,940
Systematic search understands the
query intent and focuses on customer

90
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,830
satisfaction trends in mobile banking.

91
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,390
It returns maybe to any concept
conceptually relevant document.

92
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:29,430
About customer experience metrics,
filtering out all the hardware

93
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,850
on all A 11 stuff, and focusing
mainly on user experience data.

94
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,980
This provides satisfaction surveys,
maybe NPS scores and customer feedback

95
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:42,030
analysis, and then there could
be some manual synthesis on this

96
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,190
data for maybe about a day or two.

97
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,150
Agentic search orchestrates a
very coordinated investigation.

98
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:52,695
Research agents simultaneously extract
customer satisfaction metrics from

99
00:05:52,695 --> 00:05:57,075
CRM systems, app store reviews,
support ticket databases, and show

100
00:05:57,075 --> 00:05:58,635
social media monitoring tools.

101
00:05:58,635 --> 00:06:03,615
Such a across the time period that we are
talking about analysis agents process this

102
00:06:03,615 --> 00:06:09,165
data to discover that satisfaction scores
have actually dropped maybe 20% during

103
00:06:09,165 --> 00:06:12,645
the last week of November, and there
was a mobile update at the same time.

104
00:06:12,855 --> 00:06:16,260
And it makes correlation between the
user compliance that are received.

105
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:18,835
To the navigation complexity.

106
00:06:18,835 --> 00:06:19,675
That was that.

107
00:06:19,735 --> 00:06:22,345
That was introduced because
of the new UI redesign.

108
00:06:22,705 --> 00:06:28,125
Domain expert agents contribute mobile
regulatory context, noting that similar

109
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:32,415
dissatisfaction patterns or satisfaction
patterns have occurred industry-wide

110
00:06:32,445 --> 00:06:36,165
during digital transformation
initiatives, while identifying the

111
00:06:36,165 --> 00:06:40,215
best practices from competitors
who maintained higher satisfaction

112
00:06:40,215 --> 00:06:41,335
during this transition period.

113
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,010
Quality checking agents cross validate
all these findings to potentially

114
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,030
find out if there was any sampling
bias from C seasonal factors.

115
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,210
The system delivers a
comprehensive intelligence.

116
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,950
It reports the problem and also finds
out like what was the primary cause.

117
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,180
It also does benchmarking by comparing
each two other competitors with similar

118
00:07:02,185 --> 00:07:06,830
experience, and it provides maybe some
really remediation strategies on also

119
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,510
a projected timeline for recovery.

120
00:07:08,855 --> 00:07:12,245
Complete analysis is delivered
within maybe 20 minutes.

121
00:07:12,745 --> 00:07:15,535
So now let's talk about the
multi-agent architecture.

122
00:07:15,565 --> 00:07:19,375
We can use the same example in this
case to understand the architecture

123
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:23,235
agent search systems, implement
collaborative intelligence through

124
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:27,940
specialized agent rules, each optimized
for specific analytical functions.

125
00:07:28,905 --> 00:07:34,185
Research agents decompose complex queries
into structured search components and

126
00:07:34,185 --> 00:07:38,175
re drive relevant information across
distributor data systems, including

127
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:42,585
structured databases and unstructured
documents or even external databases.

128
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:47,235
Analytical agents process this reive
information to identify pattern.

129
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,400
Correlations and insights using
statistical analysis, machine

130
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,400
learning algorithms and domain
specific analytical frameworks.

131
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:57,540
Domain expert agent applies the
specified knowledge and industry

132
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,200
specific context to ensure analytical
accuracy and relevance within a

133
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,970
particular operational environment.

134
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,680
Quality checking agent validates the
findings through systematic verification,

135
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,090
including bias detection, accuracy
assessment, and completeness evaluation.

136
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,760
So how do these agents collaborate?

137
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,850
The multi Asian coordination.

138
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:19,655
Operates through four distinct phases.

139
00:08:20,015 --> 00:08:23,375
Query interpretation phase is where
the research agents analyze the

140
00:08:23,385 --> 00:08:26,734
user queries to find out what are
the underlying requirements, and it

141
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:30,710
decomposes this complex query into
manageable investigative components.

142
00:08:31,655 --> 00:08:35,734
Distributed execution phase where
agents execute a specialized task.

143
00:08:35,734 --> 00:08:39,815
In parallel with research agents
gathering data, while analysis agents

144
00:08:39,815 --> 00:08:43,954
have begun the preliminary pattern
identification, collaborative synthesis

145
00:08:43,954 --> 00:08:48,845
phase, domain experts and analysis agents
integrate their findings to generate

146
00:08:48,845 --> 00:08:52,745
coherent analytical narratives that
address the original query requirement.

147
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:58,240
Quality validation phase where we
verify the qua, the accuracy, eliminates

148
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,290
potential bias, and ensure an analytical
integrity before the final delivery.

149
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:05,829
This architecture enables
processing capabilities that exceed

150
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:09,310
single agent limitations while
maintaining the analytical rigor

151
00:09:09,369 --> 00:09:11,770
and systematic quality AC assurance.

152
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:16,109
Let's now talk about why JavaScript
and why it is a natural fit.

153
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:20,239
JavaScript's, even driven asynchronous
architecture provides optimal

154
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:22,129
support for multi-agent coordination.

155
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,790
The language native capabilities
for handling concurrent operations,

156
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:30,319
message passing and distributed task
orchestration directly addresses the

157
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:33,619
communication and coordination challenges
inherent to multi-agent system.

158
00:09:34,025 --> 00:09:37,834
Nor JS serves as an execution environment
for high performance non-blocking

159
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:39,545
coordination among the agents.

160
00:09:40,055 --> 00:09:44,314
The platform's asynchronous IO model
enables efficient handling of multiple

161
00:09:44,314 --> 00:09:48,094
concurrent agent requests while
maintaining system responsiveness.

162
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,754
Complementary frameworks within
the Java systems ecosystem provide

163
00:09:52,145 --> 00:09:53,555
enterprise grade capabilities.

164
00:09:53,555 --> 00:09:57,935
For example, express JS and NS
js offer robust microservice

165
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,074
architecture foundations.

166
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:04,310
Event driven messaging services enable
reliable inter communication, load

167
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,360
balancing and fault tolerance, mechanism
mechanisms, ensure system reliability.

168
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,170
So now what are the core building blocks,

169
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,080
line chains, JS function as?

170
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,030
The distributed orchestration,
coordinated agent activities across

171
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:22,710
microservices using message queues,
even buses and workflow engines.

172
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,370
Systematic query interpretation,
transform the natural queries that are

173
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,360
coming in into structured intent using
embedding models, entity extraction,

174
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:32,430
and contextual understanding framework.

175
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,950
Dynamic Knowledge exchange enable
agents to share context findings and

176
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,050
state through shared memory systems,
vector database, and real time data

177
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,910
streams, quality assurance layer.

178
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,630
It implements various validation
pipelines that check for factual accu

179
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:52,400
accuracy, logical consistency, and bias
detection before returning the results.

180
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,220
This slide is a comparison between
agentic and traditional search.

181
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,215
So we see four, four different key
parameters, which is the, they are

182
00:11:01,215 --> 00:11:04,680
the KPIs, context, understanding,
reasoning, capabilities, insight

183
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,600
generation, and quality assurance.

184
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,500
And in all of them we can see that
the agent searches are performing way

185
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,890
better than both synthetic as well
as the traditional search methods.

186
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,730
Now let's talk about the
implementation pathway.

187
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,050
Organizations can implement the
agent search systems through

188
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,125
a very structured approach.

189
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,815
First they have to design
their agent personas.

190
00:11:23,905 --> 00:11:27,685
Define specified roles and
responsibilities and communication

191
00:11:27,775 --> 00:11:30,265
protocols for each of the
agent that they are choosing.

192
00:11:30,295 --> 00:11:34,150
Within the organizational context,
build the architect the orchestration

193
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,420
layer, implement even driven
coordination using JavaScripts famous

194
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:41,290
and message broker systems to enable
reliable inter agent communication.

195
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,780
Integrate knowledge systems, connect
vector databases, semantic search

196
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,230
engines, and large language model
APIs to provide the agents with the

197
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,880
comprehensive data access capabilities
and deploy quality pipelines.

198
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:58,500
Establish validation mechanism
including bias detection, accuracy

199
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,430
verification, and completeness
assessment before production deployment.

200
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,020
So what are all the tools that
the JavaScript ecosystem provides?

201
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,390
It provides multiple tools with immediate
access to production ready tools that

202
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,130
make implementation really practical.

203
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,930
Today, the land chain JS functions
as the core engine for land, large

204
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:21,520
language model orchestration, managing
complex actions, sequences, and dynamic

205
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,050
reasoning through chains and engine.

206
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:28,210
It uses these chains and agents to manage
complex action sequences and dynamic

207
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:32,470
reasoning, leveraging the expression
language for a robust streaming and

208
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:37,180
parallel execution essential for advanced
RAC and conversational AI applications.

209
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,250
Vector databases enable RAC
or the Ag augmented generation

210
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,640
implementation storing embeddings
of proprietary data for.

211
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:51,360
For ultra low latency sematic searches,
rag injects real time context into the

212
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,980
prompts bypassing the LLM context limits,
and significantly reducing hallucinations.

213
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,750
No JS microservices provide enterprise
grade scalability and resilience.

214
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:05,100
The asynchronous IO model handles
high concurrency crucial for

215
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,780
simultaneous agent request.

216
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,370
Deploy agents.

217
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,900
As mod as modular services
managed by API Gateways for robust

218
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,200
communication load balancing and
accelerated continuous delivery.

219
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,040
This technological foundation
enable implementation of agent

220
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,090
search systems using established
JavaScript development practices at

221
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,580
existing organizational expertise.

222
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,465
Now let's talk about the real
world impact implementation

223
00:13:30,825 --> 00:13:32,425
demonstrates three business impacts.

224
00:13:32,925 --> 00:13:36,915
Faster decision making agents
synthesize massive data sets in

225
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:40,755
instantly providing real-time
actionable insights that cut critical

226
00:13:40,755 --> 00:13:43,005
analysis time from days to minutes.

227
00:13:43,095 --> 00:13:47,625
Empowering rapid strategic responses,
improved accuracy by leveraging

228
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:52,065
proprietary data via rack agents,
deliver highly contextualized and

229
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,135
precise answers drastically reducing.

230
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,325
LLM has hallucinations and data errors.

231
00:13:57,075 --> 00:14:02,175
User satisfaction, highly personalized
and context aware interactions result in

232
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:06,975
relevant, specific information delivered
on demand, elevating the user experience

233
00:14:06,975 --> 00:14:08,785
for beyond traditional search methods.

234
00:14:09,285 --> 00:14:12,975
Organizations report measurable
benefits, including reduced analyst

235
00:14:12,975 --> 00:14:17,175
time allocation to for information
gathering and accelerated strategic

236
00:14:17,175 --> 00:14:20,865
decision implementation, and
improved accuracy of market analysis.

237
00:14:21,225 --> 00:14:25,755
The technology's ability to process
vast data value volumes while

238
00:14:25,755 --> 00:14:30,465
maintaining the analytical rigor
provides competitive advantages in

239
00:14:30,465 --> 00:14:31,830
time-sensitive market environments.

240
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:36,200
So what are all the challenges that
we have and that the ones that we

241
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,930
should consider latency management.

242
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:44,450
Multi-agent coordination introduces
overhead, operational overhead, optimize

243
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,050
with caching parallel execution,
progressive result streaming to

244
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:51,335
maintain the responsiveness LLM calls.

245
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,930
They usually accumulate very quickly.

246
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,610
Implement robust batching result caching
and intelligent model selection to

247
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,620
balance between the quality and budget.

248
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,660
Debu debugging the distributed
agents request comprehensive logging,

249
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,080
tracing, and monitoring across the
Y entire orchestration pipeline.

250
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,810
Quality check agents must actively
detect and mitigate bias in both

251
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:16,470
the data sources and model outputs
to ensure equitable results.

252
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,060
These challenges represent engineering
problems with established solutions rather

253
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,370
than fundamental implementation barriers.

254
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,550
So how does the future look like?

255
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,470
Agent search represents the initial
implementation of intelligent

256
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,920
problem solving ecosystem that
scale with enterprise requirements.

257
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:37,750
Future developments will enable
systems that anticipate organizational

258
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,470
needs, proactively surface the
strategic insights and continuously

259
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,330
learn from operational interactions.

260
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,380
The convergence of JavaScript's flex
flexibility with the multi-agent

261
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,580
intelligence creates opportunities for
innovation across multiple enterprise

262
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,590
domains beyond information re driver.

263
00:15:53,935 --> 00:15:57,445
Organization face a strategic
decision regarding agent

264
00:15:57,445 --> 00:15:58,705
tech architecture adoption.

265
00:15:58,915 --> 00:16:01,015
The technology foundations exist today.

266
00:16:01,195 --> 00:16:04,135
Implementation pathways are
established and the competitive

267
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,025
advent advantages are measurable.

268
00:16:06,955 --> 00:16:10,045
So with that, I would like
to conclude my presentation.

269
00:16:10,105 --> 00:16:12,970
Thank you so much for your
attention, and I appreciate that

270
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,370
opportunity to present this.

271
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,350
Thank you.
