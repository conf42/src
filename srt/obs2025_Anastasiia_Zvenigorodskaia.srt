1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,220
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:06,170
I'm Anastasia, and today I want to
share my view on how open source can be

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,420
not just useful, but also profitable.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,600
And when we hear open source, many people
think it means free, but open source, it's

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,270
about being open, not about being free.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,880
And who am I or why?

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,870
You can trust me.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,890
I'm co-founder and chief operating
officer at Epic Max, where we

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,504
built in support open source and
commercial project with V js.

10
00:00:26,504 --> 00:00:31,229
I started my open source journey
at 17 with Linux community and I

11
00:00:31,229 --> 00:00:34,960
spent more than 10 years in frontend
development and project management.

12
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:39,745
I also was the chief editor of the
Open Source Magazine user in Linux for

13
00:00:39,745 --> 00:00:44,904
three years, and as you can see, I'm
really not great at choosing usernames.

14
00:00:45,404 --> 00:00:47,024
And what you'll learn today.

15
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:51,245
First I want to share with you our
story in epic marks how much time and

16
00:00:51,245 --> 00:00:53,165
money we spent on opensource projects.

17
00:00:53,915 --> 00:00:57,494
Then I will show you three key
parts of successful opensource

18
00:00:57,494 --> 00:01:02,814
projects and seven ization models
with real and really cute examples.

19
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:07,424
I will show you a stage of any open
source project and which model fits

20
00:01:07,424 --> 00:01:12,705
best for each stage, and how to attract
users depending on stage that you allow.

21
00:01:13,455 --> 00:01:17,965
And in the end of my talk of I will
show you our biggest mistake, key

22
00:01:17,965 --> 00:01:21,505
lessons we learn and what we do
now with our open source projects.

23
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:24,914
And let's try to understand how
must open and source project starts.

24
00:01:25,035 --> 00:01:26,235
Usually start like this.

25
00:01:26,235 --> 00:01:30,225
This tool doesn't work the way I
want, so I want to build my own.

26
00:01:30,884 --> 00:01:33,735
And if your goal is to
make your work easier.

27
00:01:34,235 --> 00:01:36,185
So helpful with the community.

28
00:01:36,185 --> 00:01:37,505
It's a great idea.

29
00:01:37,505 --> 00:01:39,645
Just forgot for forget monetization.

30
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:41,445
You need to enjoy it.

31
00:01:41,445 --> 00:01:42,675
You can build what you love.

32
00:01:42,675 --> 00:01:44,355
No limit, no pressure.

33
00:01:44,865 --> 00:01:49,455
But if you want to turn your open source
project into a business, you need to

34
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:51,465
start thinking like a business founder.

35
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:54,255
And you need to choose
your strategy from day one.

36
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,090
I believe only monetized
project can be successful.

37
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:03,250
And for building good product, you need
to invest a lot of time energy and money.

38
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:07,419
And if everything depend only on
you, you will hit a wall one day

39
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:12,040
and ask yourself honestly, is your
project a hobby or a business?

40
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:16,810
And for hobby project, it's a great
opportunity to learn new skills,

41
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,049
to connect with the community
and build your portfolio and

42
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:21,880
maybe find a great job one day.

43
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,769
But if you want to build a business,
it can grow your name bring you a real

44
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:29,170
income, but you need to have a clear plan.

45
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:33,339
And let me tell you how it
all started in epic max.

46
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:37,049
Our company was founded by a
developer who didn't want to

47
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:39,299
code loan, so he hired others.

48
00:02:39,779 --> 00:02:41,639
Classic story for technical companies.

49
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:46,019
And we had no portfolio, no
public project because all our

50
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,579
previous work was under NDA.

51
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:54,679
So we can show it, but we have a lot
of love for VGS and opensource ideas.

52
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:59,179
So we said, let's build something
opensource, let's show to our potential

53
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:03,200
clients and ourselves that we can
build something real, something cool.

54
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,190
And this is how Used Economy was born.

55
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,499
It's a set of ready to use dashboard page.

56
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:14,049
And in just few days it becomes the
first most popular rep on GitHub.

57
00:03:14,589 --> 00:03:18,939
And it help us attract first
commercial clients for our company

58
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:21,519
and have confidence in ourselves.

59
00:03:22,029 --> 00:03:23,559
And it was great result.

60
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:27,009
But we maybe we can stop
on this and just continue.

61
00:03:27,694 --> 00:03:33,694
Concentrate on more commercial side of our
company, but we continue in two direction.

62
00:03:33,994 --> 00:03:39,884
We working on client's project using
ZE tool set and sometimes use our

63
00:03:39,884 --> 00:03:44,944
views to guide when we didn't push
it a lot, but sometimes we use it

64
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:49,134
for our client's project, but more
most of our client use own tool set.

65
00:03:49,534 --> 00:03:49,924
Other.

66
00:03:50,734 --> 00:03:56,764
Admin templates or just some frameworks
and we continue development and

67
00:03:56,764 --> 00:04:01,625
support of our open source product
and invested money and time for it.

68
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:06,055
And later that year, we publish it a
small open source project at Big Spins.

69
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:11,955
It's a set of flood and animations
built only with CSS and to be honest,

70
00:04:11,955 --> 00:04:16,305
we did it just because we wanted
to play around with CSS animations.

71
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:20,955
And then we understood that our
admin panel had a lot of components

72
00:04:20,955 --> 00:04:26,435
and in a couple of year we decided
to move them into separate library.

73
00:04:26,945 --> 00:04:29,045
And that's how VKI was born.

74
00:04:29,885 --> 00:04:33,875
And in October this year, we started free
online meetups for front-end developers,

75
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,974
not only with UJS but yeah, it UJS talks.

76
00:04:37,664 --> 00:04:44,715
And at first we made it because we want
to stay like a team and all our developers

77
00:04:44,715 --> 00:04:49,504
live different countries, but then some
popular speakers start joining us and our

78
00:04:49,504 --> 00:04:51,544
meetups become regular and more public.

79
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:56,299
And if you want to join us like a speaker
or just a deep, please write me, I'll

80
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:02,119
send you everything about it and let show
you some numbers that we have for now.

81
00:05:02,454 --> 00:05:09,114
For admin, we have around 2000 forks and
more than 10,000 stars for epic spin.

82
00:05:09,414 --> 00:05:14,614
We have 360 forks and almost 4,000 stars.

83
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:21,274
For review, QI, we have
354 forks and 3,600 stars.

84
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:25,859
And for future desktops, we have
around 200 calendar subscribers

85
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:28,789
and around 40, 50 people live.

86
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:33,729
And let's do some quick calculation to
understand how much it would cost you.

87
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:38,049
Take your developers hour rate and
taxes and multiply it by numbers.

88
00:05:38,049 --> 00:05:42,379
We number of hours we spent
on our open source projects.

89
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:45,979
I use this average
mid-level developer rate.

90
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:50,960
For Spain in this year, because
I live in Spain, I use it for

91
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,530
calculation to give you a clear
understanding of the potential cost.

92
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:59,934
It's not same with our spending, but
more or less maybe we can say that

93
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:01,854
yes, maybe it's something like that.

94
00:06:02,104 --> 00:06:07,844
And we spend more than 4,000
hours for, and it can cost you.

95
00:06:08,694 --> 00:06:15,084
90,000 euro and you can ask me why
it's so much, because it wasn't

96
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:16,884
just one version of product.

97
00:06:16,914 --> 00:06:20,215
It was was three different version of use.

98
00:06:20,215 --> 00:06:20,755
Two admins.

99
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:26,185
You need to do some redesign work
because eight years ago we had.

100
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:28,995
Different design styles and trends.

101
00:06:29,415 --> 00:06:31,635
You need to fix a lot of bugs.

102
00:06:31,635 --> 00:06:36,995
You need to support community do some
discussion and discord work on docs,

103
00:06:37,025 --> 00:06:41,855
and it's a lot of additional work,
not only development of product.

104
00:06:42,215 --> 00:06:46,295
And you'll create not only product,
you'll create a technical depth.

105
00:06:46,795 --> 00:06:51,835
For AP experience, we spend
around 470 hours and it can

106
00:06:51,835 --> 00:06:53,935
cost you around 10,000 euro.

107
00:06:54,265 --> 00:06:56,275
And why did it take so many hours?

108
00:06:56,275 --> 00:06:56,815
Because.

109
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,190
Same, it didn't just finished
with like a pet project because

110
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,080
we need to have some landing page.

111
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,660
We need to pay for design work and
fix some bug and continue supporting.

112
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,150
And for VT QI, we spent
more than 22,000 hours.

113
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,490
And using this average rate,
it can cost you almost half of.

114
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,600
Million Euroes so much.

115
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,680
And for view talks, I
think we spent nothing.

116
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,300
And for now, I think we spent
around four hours per month for

117
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,050
everything to organize online event.

118
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:39,950
And yes, we had more visibility and
we looked better than other agencies.

119
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,430
But we could have achieved more.

120
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,200
So what went wrong?

121
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:48,360
Why do some open source project
make money and others don't?

122
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,840
And the answer, simple, successful
project have a strategy.

123
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,880
And without a strategy, I want
to say that I. Any open source

124
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,770
project is just expensive hobby.

125
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:03,750
And if you want to build open source
seriously, you need to have this skill.

126
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,750
First you need to have brutal
honesty with yourself and, let me

127
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,820
share with you the three kinks.

128
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,390
The must have parts of any
successful open source journey.

129
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,090
The first kink, it's strong idea.

130
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,250
Your product should solve a real problem.

131
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,630
And how can you understand?

132
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,830
Is it enough strong?

133
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,480
You need to talk to people.

134
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,100
Ask as developers for feedback.

135
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:30,650
You can ask open source, community
people here, super friendly, super open.

136
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:36,900
You can watch what other people do, what
your competitors doing, and maybe catch

137
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,430
some ideas or understand what they did
wrong and just interpret their mistake.

138
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,950
Second key is active
community and contributors.

139
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,710
You need to engage people
and then you can grow.

140
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,780
And I'm absolutely sure that.

141
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:54,195
Solid developers move slower and
always stuck in their own mind.

142
00:08:54,645 --> 00:08:59,125
And you can have real feedback only
from community because people use

143
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,765
your quote in wrong, unexpected ways.

144
00:09:01,795 --> 00:09:05,245
And it's great because it's
how you can grow your product.

145
00:09:05,695 --> 00:09:10,765
And I believe that having 50 small
contributors betters and have three

146
00:09:10,765 --> 00:09:16,345
full-time developers that you pay and
the last kink is sustainable monetization

147
00:09:16,345 --> 00:09:18,175
model is your long-term strategy.

148
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:22,435
And let's try to understand how can
you make money with open source?

149
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:26,185
You need to choose the right model,
let's say with seven of them.

150
00:09:26,425 --> 00:09:29,515
And to make it simple and
fun, let's imagine you don't

151
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:30,925
trade code, you make choose.

152
00:09:31,915 --> 00:09:34,615
And first meditation model is open core.

153
00:09:34,915 --> 00:09:35,485
Free shoes.

154
00:09:35,545 --> 00:09:36,505
Premium comfort.

155
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:39,625
You give people free shoes for
walking around the city, but

156
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:43,165
if they want better comfort and
stringent material they need to pay.

157
00:09:43,555 --> 00:09:47,295
And real examples in GitLab
Grafana, elastic Short, this model

158
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,745
best for projects that have a
clear line between basic and pro.

159
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:54,545
And good part of this model, you
can attract many users because

160
00:09:54,545 --> 00:09:55,865
you can show something for free.

161
00:09:55,955 --> 00:09:59,065
They can test it, and you
have flexible monetization.

162
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:01,435
You control and decide what to sell.

163
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:07,305
But it's hard to draw the line
between free and paid functions.

164
00:10:07,635 --> 00:10:11,445
And it's really important because
if you close everything, maybe don't

165
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,915
want to you can't find contributors.

166
00:10:14,295 --> 00:10:18,845
If you are open too much, maybe
don't nobody want to pay and you

167
00:10:18,845 --> 00:10:20,405
need to maintain two versions.

168
00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:25,945
It's will create a big technical debt
and you'll can have this problem with

169
00:10:26,155 --> 00:10:30,235
big cloud providers that they can
host your opensource project make

170
00:10:30,235 --> 00:10:32,115
some money and never pay you back.

171
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:36,435
Maybe you heard about some stories,
we use big cloud providers,

172
00:10:36,935 --> 00:10:41,315
and the next model is SaaS free
shoes, paid cleaning and delivery.

173
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:45,295
People can take your shoes and clean
them by themself, but if they want

174
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:49,555
clean ready shoes, deliver every
week, you can offer this service.

175
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,530
Real example in tech.

176
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,900
GitHub Cloud Next Studio, Docker Hub.

177
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,620
This model best for those who
can offer host support and

178
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,870
a good part of this model.

179
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,430
You will have recurring venue.

180
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,830
It's great for business.

181
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:05,760
You can plan something, maybe
hire a team, and it fully open

182
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,140
source and community friendly.

183
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,870
But it requires a lot of investment for
infrastructure and customer support.

184
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,300
Next model, dual li free
for walks, paid for work.

185
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:21,070
You can wear the shoes in the park for
free, but if you are waiter walking 12

186
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,410
hours per day, you need a special version.

187
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,370
You need to pay for it.

188
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:29,950
And real example in tech, my security
edge agreed this model best for tools

189
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,610
used by companies and good parts
and developers use it for free and

190
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,010
they happy and companies should pay.

191
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,880
And you have protection from
big cloud, selling your product

192
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,110
without paying, but you need clear
leads terms and maybe lawyers.

193
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,270
Next model.

194
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,330
Supporting consulting shoes
are free, but help is paid.

195
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,480
You give the shoes for free,
but if someone wants you to

196
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,850
come check the feet change the
install, they pay for your help.

197
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:59,440
Real examples, in Tech, it's
a redhead ut QI Next cloud.

198
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,980
This model best for teams that
can work directly with client

199
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,540
and good part of this model.

200
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,230
You'll have high value client and
trust and long-term relationships.

201
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:11,965
But it's not easy to scale
because it depend on people

202
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,525
and on your personal brand.

203
00:12:13,975 --> 00:12:17,275
And you still sell human
hours, not product usage.

204
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:20,175
It's a big limit and it's hard to scale.

205
00:12:20,675 --> 00:12:22,085
Next, model, plug and send.

206
00:12:22,085 --> 00:12:25,415
Marketplace base shoes are
free decoration or cost money.

207
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,810
You give basic black shocks for free,
but if someone wants to have red

208
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,970
laces, they can buy them separately.

209
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:36,980
And real example, in WordPress and
Grafana, this model best for project where

210
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:42,530
you can add some extra and people pay
only for what they need and they happy.

211
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,790
And you can grow into a big
and full ecosystem if you have

212
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,080
a lot of different plugins.

213
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:52,040
But you need to be community
or it won't work because maybe

214
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,840
your plugin can be a bit cheap.

215
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,070
It hard to control plugin
quality and consistency if you.

216
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,290
Sponsorship.

217
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,840
You make shoes and kind
people support you.

218
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,390
You say, I make some shoes for everyone.

219
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,470
Please support me.

220
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,780
And people donate because
they love what you do.

221
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,030
And real examples and blender.

222
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,900
This model best for project with
strong community and good part of

223
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,350
this model, you kept everything fully
open source and you can build strong

224
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,060
emotional connection with community.

225
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,030
You can maybe build some offline events.

226
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,190
Bad parts.

227
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,420
It's low and stable income and
hard to plan growth or hire team.

228
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:33,190
Maybe you saw cases where some open source
project got a big sponsor, started hiring

229
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:37,960
people and invest a lot, and then the
sponsor put out and thing got really sad.

230
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,580
And the last model that we want to
discuss, it's courses and education.

231
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,920
You make sure and teach others.

232
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,850
You keep working on your open
source shoes, but you also teach

233
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,320
other how to make similar ones.

234
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,220
Use online courses, host webinars,
and office certification.

235
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,130
Real example in Tech, Linux
Foundation in View School.

236
00:13:57,565 --> 00:14:01,675
This model best for experts and community
leaders and good parts of this model.

237
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:02,935
You'll have stable income.

238
00:14:02,935 --> 00:14:06,655
It's great, and you can build a
strong personal and project brands.

239
00:14:06,685 --> 00:14:10,680
And maybe if you decide to build
something else in future, it's

240
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,530
great because you already have
some community and some audience.

241
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:17,350
But you need to spend time
and money to build content.

242
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,480
And you need to have teaching and
speaking skills, but I believe you can

243
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,740
build it and maybe it can be distraction
from product development, but this

244
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,420
model I think it's easy to delegate it.

245
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,270
You just can find some people
with this experience and they

246
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,560
can create content for you.

247
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,682
So what is the best model?

248
00:14:36,405 --> 00:14:39,075
As saw this, it's no one perfect transfer.

249
00:14:39,105 --> 00:14:43,005
Most successful project used two or
three MO models together, for example.

250
00:14:43,005 --> 00:14:48,015
Next, use SA consulting and support
models, tower use listing and sponsors and

251
00:14:48,015 --> 00:14:53,585
hardware and Grafana use open core plugins
and hoisting and how to choose the model.

252
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:58,205
I think you need to understand
where you now and let's try to

253
00:14:58,205 --> 00:15:01,815
understand which stage of open source
product and which model fits best.

254
00:15:02,315 --> 00:15:06,485
First stage, early stage you just
started and your goal here at

255
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:09,815
good users get feedback and build
community around your product.

256
00:15:10,385 --> 00:15:11,105
What matters here?

257
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:14,675
Yes, it's easy to start, but you
need to build trust and you need

258
00:15:14,675 --> 00:15:19,565
to focus on value, not money yet,
and good models for this stage.

259
00:15:19,595 --> 00:15:24,115
It's sponsorship and maybe you can
use GitHub accelerator program.

260
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:28,395
I think they still don't have dates
for application for this year.

261
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:28,815
Maybe.

262
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:34,275
Next month and if you build
something with AI in title yes,

263
00:15:34,275 --> 00:15:35,875
maybe it's a good suit for you.

264
00:15:36,695 --> 00:15:40,895
You can use educational model,
create some videos, blocks, and give

265
00:15:40,895 --> 00:15:43,115
talks, and you can do consulting.

266
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,465
So where do you find first users?

267
00:15:46,735 --> 00:15:49,555
If you're on early stage,
you need to follow some baby

268
00:15:49,555 --> 00:15:51,805
steps and please don't wait.

269
00:15:51,805 --> 00:15:56,725
For the lunch and something like
1000 stars on GitHub, you need to

270
00:15:56,775 --> 00:16:01,785
start sharing your story early, even
before your publish your project.

271
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:05,055
Because people love the protest
and people love the stories.

272
00:16:05,415 --> 00:16:10,245
You can start with your idea that
if you, only have idea for now.

273
00:16:10,455 --> 00:16:12,725
You can start create
some content around it.

274
00:16:13,155 --> 00:16:18,345
Show it in some social media in
LinkedIn or Twitter or Instagram,

275
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,815
even if you have some audience.

276
00:16:20,295 --> 00:16:25,885
You can start post on Reddit or
Medium, join some Discord communities

277
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:29,845
and you can start creating some
audience for your future product.

278
00:16:30,265 --> 00:16:33,145
And it's important to share
your values and goals because

279
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:34,795
I think we all buy something.

280
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:39,255
I believe we support only products
that connected with our values.

281
00:16:39,525 --> 00:16:45,055
And if you start sharing it, you can
have some early supporters and then

282
00:16:45,115 --> 00:16:48,565
early clients, you can do consulting.

283
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:53,155
You need to be visible and helpful and
ask for real feedback, not only for stars.

284
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,840
And real feedback can come
from some consulting work.

285
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,850
You can offer some free help.

286
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,220
But please always set clear boundaries.

287
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,090
For example, if you build something
like Time Check for companies, you

288
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:09,050
can offer three free consultations.

289
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,790
For example, first consultation for
Setting Everything app second for train.

290
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:19,155
Employees and the last
one for some QA session.

291
00:17:19,545 --> 00:17:25,845
And if they want you to build some custom
solution or continuous technical support,

292
00:17:26,265 --> 00:17:28,885
then you can offer some paid consultant.

293
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,580
And you can become, maybe
shouldn't become a speaker.

294
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:40,050
And even small online meetups can give you
some early users and zen future clients.

295
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,460
And even one good offline talk
can give you a lot of users,

296
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,860
contributors, and future clients.

297
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:53,010
And, you can look in for some small
events in your city, maybe online

298
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,000
events that we have in my company.

299
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:58,690
I heard a lot of other companies
have something like that.

300
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,830
And next stage maybe is the
most interesting growing stage.

301
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:06,520
You already have some users and
your goals here start earning

302
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,990
money and scale the project.

303
00:18:08,445 --> 00:18:09,375
What matters here?

304
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,360
You need to show people clearly reason,
a reason to pay, not just please

305
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,760
support me and you need to have.

306
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:21,950
Simple pricing and you need
to build repeatable income.

307
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,460
Not only one of donation even, it's big.

308
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:30,000
It's better if you have small,
but a recurring donations.

309
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,399
Good models here.

310
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:36,449
It's open core SaaS and marketplace,
and you need to split the feature

311
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:40,159
in two groups, like free for
everyone and premium for teams.

312
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,919
Where do you find paying users?

313
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,840
You need to start with your current users.

314
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:47,570
Talk to them, ask what they paid for.

315
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:52,109
Use some onboarding emails, discord
channels, feedback calls, and you need to

316
00:18:52,109 --> 00:18:54,809
turn early adopters into early clients.

317
00:18:55,349 --> 00:18:59,994
And you need to promote your your product
with real results because you already have

318
00:18:59,994 --> 00:19:05,604
some users, some case studies you need
to create content post video, but more

319
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:09,114
focused on solutions and success stories.

320
00:19:09,989 --> 00:19:12,149
And you can create some
partnership program.

321
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:16,239
If your product match to bigger
ecosystem, you can collaborate with

322
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:21,039
others, maybe agencies or product
companies serving the same audience.

323
00:19:21,249 --> 00:19:25,354
For example, I know about
partnership program in for VS.

324
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:27,459
For next, for example.

325
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:29,659
You can go for some.

326
00:19:30,449 --> 00:19:36,299
Websites for your ecosystem and try
to build something that you can have

327
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:39,999
clients and maybe like just users.

328
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:44,729
But it's a great opportunity
to start open yourself to other

329
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:47,369
people in your ecosystem and.

330
00:19:47,694 --> 00:19:49,554
Maybe it is the most wanted stage.

331
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:52,284
It's business stage when
companies use your product.

332
00:19:52,554 --> 00:19:55,914
And Yoko here it's stable
income and enterprise clients.

333
00:19:56,484 --> 00:19:57,804
What important here?

334
00:19:58,144 --> 00:20:01,834
You need to have great li
security and compliance.

335
00:20:02,194 --> 00:20:05,134
You need to create clear
business contract your.

336
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:09,499
Company should looks like a serious
business that big companies can trust

337
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:12,109
and you need to offer long-term support.

338
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:15,889
Good models here is to lead and
support and consulting and open

339
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:20,989
source open core plus CLA, how to
grow and find users at this stage.

340
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:23,464
You need to go where your clients are.

341
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:28,224
For example, some tech conferences
B2B events, and you can partner with

342
00:20:28,254 --> 00:20:29,659
agents that serve your audience.

343
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:35,749
And you need to show yourself like a
solution, not only product you need

344
00:20:35,749 --> 00:20:41,139
to, explain to business how your
tool can save their money, time,

345
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:45,339
and reduce risk because it's so
important for enterprise companies.

346
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:50,019
You need to showcase studies, benchmarks,
create some immigration guides offer

347
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:55,719
an audit, maybe start offering free
audits and do it like wait and.

348
00:20:55,789 --> 00:21:00,259
You need to start hire right people
with open source experience for sales.

349
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:05,780
Yes, maybe you already have a big
team of developers QA specialists or

350
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:11,719
managers, but you need to have right
person for sales, community manager.

351
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,679
Content manager maybe, and
generation specialist said, you

352
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,269
need to start doing some boring
stuff that may be nobody in tech.

353
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:21,199
Love it.

354
00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:22,759
You need to create.

355
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:25,989
Call, emails, do some
demos, onboarding calls.

356
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:29,339
It's more like doing
regular commercial business.

357
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:32,669
But if you want to grow on this
stage, you need to do that because

358
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:36,359
you have a lot of competitors,
not only in open source world.

359
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:41,469
On this stage, you compete with,
commercial project and they have

360
00:21:41,469 --> 00:21:43,179
a lot of benefits for business.

361
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:49,099
You need to show that you can offer
serious support long-term relationship.

362
00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:51,499
You understand how business works.

363
00:21:51,589 --> 00:21:56,739
You need to have some business
and sales skills for this stage.

364
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:02,249
And if you did everything and
still want to grow further, you.

365
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:05,314
Need to find new markets,
maybe new countries.

366
00:22:05,684 --> 00:22:08,894
Maybe it's right moment to hire
business development manager.

367
00:22:09,314 --> 00:22:10,874
And you need to do upselling.

368
00:22:10,994 --> 00:22:13,004
Look into your client's database.

369
00:22:13,034 --> 00:22:16,634
Ensure you need to create
some database in CRM.

370
00:22:17,204 --> 00:22:21,614
You need to, work with it and
try to understand what you can

371
00:22:21,614 --> 00:22:23,554
sell for your current clients.

372
00:22:23,554 --> 00:22:28,634
Maybe you can offer more extra
features, more consulting services,

373
00:22:28,634 --> 00:22:35,004
some custom development, and you can
start looking for big fish in like cloud

374
00:22:35,064 --> 00:22:37,794
providers and create big partnerships.

375
00:22:37,944 --> 00:22:38,304
It's.

376
00:22:38,664 --> 00:22:41,814
Sometime it's so expensive, but
maybe it's right moment to do that.

377
00:22:41,844 --> 00:22:44,784
If you already have some
income and it's more or less

378
00:22:44,784 --> 00:22:46,944
regular, you can try to invest.

379
00:22:47,404 --> 00:22:51,884
But like carefully and then
you will have great results.

380
00:22:52,384 --> 00:22:54,884
And back to our story in Epic max.

381
00:22:54,884 --> 00:22:55,274
Yes.

382
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:59,714
After eight years in open source,
we still on early stage, and if you

383
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:03,994
find yourself in the same situation,
please don't be stuck and frustrated.

384
00:23:04,534 --> 00:23:09,364
And yes, for us it could have cost
us much less, but, let's try to

385
00:23:09,364 --> 00:23:11,194
understand where did we go wrong.

386
00:23:11,674 --> 00:23:16,594
We didn't have strategy or clear goals
before investing for each product.

387
00:23:16,744 --> 00:23:20,734
And we have three different
projects and we need to create

388
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:23,384
a strategy for each product.

389
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:27,674
It's not just one open source strategy,
and if you have couple of project

390
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:30,174
you need to separate your strategy.

391
00:23:30,674 --> 00:23:34,604
We expect that our developers can
choose tasks based on business

392
00:23:34,604 --> 00:23:39,994
impact, not on the interest, but
honestly, if we didn't understand our

393
00:23:39,994 --> 00:23:42,394
goals, how could they understand it?

394
00:23:42,874 --> 00:23:46,414
And we had lack of real
experience using our product.

395
00:23:46,474 --> 00:23:50,624
In commercial project, yes, we had
some clients with our products,

396
00:23:50,624 --> 00:23:52,574
but it's not enough for having.

397
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:58,199
Good feedback and for improving our
product, for staying competitive

398
00:23:58,199 --> 00:24:02,909
with others because yes, still for
us, we have some big competitors

399
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:05,719
and we didn't use it enough.

400
00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:08,929
We believed if we build
something, user will come.

401
00:24:08,929 --> 00:24:12,349
And yes, we had some user and you saw it.

402
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:14,389
It's really not bad results.

403
00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:17,169
But in mining, it's still zero.

404
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:22,239
We was focused only on quote, on no
on business strategy or marketing.

405
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:27,459
And if we can merge everything that
I said before in one sentence, we

406
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:29,394
treated the project like a hobby.

407
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,395
No financial planning, no donation set up.

408
00:24:32,395 --> 00:24:33,625
Still, we don't have it.

409
00:24:34,044 --> 00:24:37,495
No budgeting, no strategy sessions
because it's something about like

410
00:24:37,585 --> 00:24:41,815
business, not about open source, but
we invested in all of our project,

411
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:44,295
like commercial projects, but.

412
00:24:44,795 --> 00:24:49,275
To be honest, we made a lot of mistakes,
but we also did a few think really right.

413
00:24:49,815 --> 00:24:51,435
We built a strong team.

414
00:24:51,465 --> 00:24:56,025
We used our open source project like
sandbox for all our new developers

415
00:24:56,475 --> 00:24:58,365
to test and are onboard them.

416
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,995
And I think it's great results for us.

417
00:25:01,145 --> 00:25:05,325
I think all our developers are super
cool, super technically skilled.

418
00:25:05,825 --> 00:25:09,845
Because I think it's not enough
to have two, maybe three steps of

419
00:25:09,845 --> 00:25:13,685
technical interview for understand
is it great match to your company?

420
00:25:14,165 --> 00:25:18,695
'cause it's not only about technical
side of person, it's a lot of soft skill.

421
00:25:18,695 --> 00:25:20,665
And maybe same vibe with us.

422
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:26,769
And for us it was really important to
find people with open source experience.

423
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:29,049
And we have great team for now.

424
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:32,739
I think we was focused, we
choose one small technology

425
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,229
and never looked, to others.

426
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:40,089
We use only view JS for development
and it gave us a clear niche

427
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:41,979
and help it to sell for now.

428
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:45,579
And we built trust in partnership
in the view ecosystem.

429
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:50,379
We start doing some partnership with
Beautify and Prime View that maybe,

430
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:54,159
yeah, we can say they our competitors,
but I believe in open source world.

431
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,599
We don't have competitors.

432
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:00,519
We all partners and we finally
recognized our mistake and

433
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:02,169
started doing something in.

434
00:26:02,614 --> 00:26:07,534
Strategy for now, we almost
stop on non-strategic investment

435
00:26:07,534 --> 00:26:08,614
in open source project.

436
00:26:08,614 --> 00:26:13,474
We focused more on view integrations,
not only on creating some new

437
00:26:13,474 --> 00:26:18,304
components or fixing bug, and
we stopped to be in silence.

438
00:26:18,304 --> 00:26:22,054
We started writing some
articles, posting speaking on

439
00:26:22,054 --> 00:26:24,099
conferences and hosting on events.

440
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:29,669
And what's next is this shift might
finally move us to growing stage

441
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:32,579
where we can have some stable income.

442
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:37,589
And in this moment, smart investment
truly makes sense and maybe we can create

443
00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:42,659
some paid product like ready to use
package based on use stick admin maybe

444
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:44,579
for FinTech for example, or legal tech.

445
00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:48,179
And maybe we can create some
examples and plugins for

446
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:50,610
Marketplace and sell them based on.

447
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:56,570
But this time we absolutely want to start
with strategic planning, clear financial

448
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:59,060
model and real contributor involvement.

449
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:04,560
It's that idea to do everything internal
and let me share with you some key

450
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,080
takeaways I want to leave to you.

451
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,000
Open source needs more than just code.

452
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,460
It needs strategy and clear goals.

453
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:17,140
You need to choose human monetization
model early based on your stage, and

454
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,120
you need to focus on community first.

455
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,685
But never forget the business
side and like marketing side.

456
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:27,630
You need to hire right people in
the right moment and do sales like

457
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,430
abroad if you want to have money.

458
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:33,230
Mistakes are part of
every open source journey.

459
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:37,940
Just don't stay stuck and it's never
too late toing, rebuild and grow your

460
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,010
product and I believe you can do it.

461
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,710
And thank you so much for your attention.

462
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,860
If you like the talk, you
can connect me on LinkedIn.

463
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:48,740
If you didn't, please connect
me anyway and tell me why.

464
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,100
And if you have any question
or ideas, I'd love to chat.

465
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,840
And thank you for being here.

466
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,680
Thank you for your attention to
opensource community and goodbye.
