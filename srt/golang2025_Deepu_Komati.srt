1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,530
Hey, good morning everyone.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,200
It's an absolute pleasure
to be here today.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,270
Today I will be discussing about
scaling financial design systems

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,310
with go by building high performance
FinTech infrastructure in the cloud.

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,369
Let's start the session.

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:22,970
How many of you have ever been frustrated
with slow and outdated financial systems?

7
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,150
It may be a via transfer.

8
00:00:25,465 --> 00:00:26,305
Took long.

9
00:00:26,575 --> 00:00:29,634
A repayment got stuck
without a clear reason.

10
00:00:30,135 --> 00:00:31,215
We have been there.

11
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:37,875
Financial system should be
fast, secure, and frictionless.

12
00:00:38,835 --> 00:00:43,965
But legacy structure and outdated
technology often makes this a challenging.

13
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:48,345
This is where go on cloud
native architecture comes in.

14
00:00:49,185 --> 00:00:51,045
They enable us to build scalable.

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,390
Resilient and high performance
financial systems that can perform

16
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,310
millions of transactions in real time.

17
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,270
In today's session, I will walk you
through how we process millions of

18
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:10,400
transaction style using Go Power
Microservices by leveraging AI

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,110
and machine learning to predict
risk, detect fraud, and optimize

20
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,780
financial decisions, build secure.

21
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:24,070
Scalable A PS that tell us seamless
integration across banks on digital

22
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,740
wallets and financial applications.

23
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:33,550
Reduce infrastructure cost by 40% while
some inte increase speed and security.

24
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,590
Does it sound exciting?

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,680
Now, let's deep dive in.

26
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,690
now let's deep dive into our
microservice architecture.

27
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,410
Now I built a truly
scalable financial system.

28
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,550
We need a solid architectural foundation.

29
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,710
Let's imagine a highway,
let's imagine a highway.

30
00:01:53,685 --> 00:01:56,985
Where cars move smoothly
without traffic jumps.

31
00:01:57,285 --> 00:02:03,485
That's exactly what we have built with our
microservice architecture, cloud native

32
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:06,415
process by distributing transaction.

33
00:02:06,955 --> 00:02:07,675
Processing.

34
00:02:08,365 --> 00:02:14,415
We present services, overloads and exits
industry standards by 35% by using Go.

35
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:17,205
Go is built for speed and con.

36
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:21,725
While traditional languages like Java
or Python struggle with high load

37
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:27,085
processing with go goin enables us
to handle thousands of requests per

38
00:02:27,445 --> 00:02:32,635
second with minimal latency coming
to resilience distributor systems.

39
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:39,700
Our architecture guarantees that
99.99% uptime by ensuring that

40
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:45,040
even if a service fails, traffic is
automatically re rerouted to backup notes.

41
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,725
To put this into.

42
00:02:47,225 --> 00:02:52,385
Perspective, think about Black Friday
or major stock market trading days when

43
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:54,545
Dragon section volume score search.

44
00:02:55,234 --> 00:03:00,215
Our system scales dynamically to handle
these spikes, ensuring a seamless

45
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:01,864
experience for millions of users.

46
00:03:02,855 --> 00:03:07,535
But not only scalability, we
also need intelligence in our

47
00:03:07,535 --> 00:03:10,535
systems because everywhere we see.

48
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:16,895
Artificial intelligence is growing big and
machine learning is dominating everywhere.

49
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:21,025
So let's move to mission
learning integration.

50
00:03:21,525 --> 00:03:24,855
Coming to mission learning, integration
and artificial intelligence.

51
00:03:25,815 --> 00:03:28,935
These are revolutionaries in
financial decision making.

52
00:03:29,595 --> 00:03:31,815
So how do we bring intelligence?

53
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:32,790
Into FinTech.

54
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,080
That's what our question.

55
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,750
Over here with help of data ingestion, we
process massive amount of structured and

56
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,780
unstructured data, including transactions.

57
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,340
Under histories on real time marketing
feeds, customer spending patterns, and

58
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:56,420
also with help of AI powered analysis,
our module uncovers patterns that

59
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:02,420
human might overlook, like such as
predicting which customer are likely to

60
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,590
default on loans, identifying trading.

61
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:12,140
Opportunities in volatile market
security and fraud detection, our

62
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:18,620
AI reduced false positive by 78% by
ensuring that legitimate transactions

63
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,020
go through without unnecessary blocks.

64
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,020
Quick caution for you all guys here.

65
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:24,765
How many of you had.

66
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:30,005
Had credit card transaction
declined due to security concerns.

67
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:34,835
Now, imagine if instead of blocking
your legitimate transaction, AI

68
00:04:34,835 --> 00:04:38,915
could accurately differentiate
between fraud and a normal purchase.

69
00:04:39,395 --> 00:04:41,375
That's exactly what our system does.

70
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:46,135
But intelligence is only useful
if it can be shared efficiently.

71
00:04:47,065 --> 00:04:56,545
That brings us API and backbone of modern
financial systems coming to API ecosystem.

72
00:04:56,905 --> 00:05:02,005
Coming to API ecosystem, APIs are the glue
that connects modern financial systems.

73
00:05:02,395 --> 00:05:06,205
Without them, banks and FinTech
platforms would be isolated.

74
00:05:06,595 --> 00:05:10,195
Islands struggling to
communicate with each other.

75
00:05:10,735 --> 00:05:18,105
Our API ecosystem handles over 15 million
dial requests with 99.9 uptime, supporting

76
00:05:18,105 --> 00:05:22,845
both rest and graphical, offering
flexibility for different clients.

77
00:05:23,675 --> 00:05:27,665
Accelerates integration, banks
and FinTech companies can go

78
00:05:27,665 --> 00:05:29,525
live in weeks instead of months.

79
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:32,405
Let's take a real world example.

80
00:05:32,795 --> 00:05:37,265
Imagine a startup company that wants
to offer instant credit scoring

81
00:05:38,075 --> 00:05:44,015
with our a PS, they can tap into
our AI engine, analyze the user's

82
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:49,475
credit worthiness in real time,
and approve a loan within seconds.

83
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:54,265
API alone or in turnoff, we
need strong, scalable cloud

84
00:05:54,265 --> 00:05:55,765
infrastructure to support them.

85
00:05:56,515 --> 00:05:58,255
Let's explore that next.

86
00:05:58,755 --> 00:06:04,695
Coming to cloud infrastructure revolution,
migrating to the cloud is ingested trend.

87
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:10,425
It's necessary for modern financial
systems by ensuring zero downtime

88
00:06:10,815 --> 00:06:15,885
migration, be transactioned, enter
bank system to the cloud without

89
00:06:16,305 --> 00:06:17,925
disturbing daily operations.

90
00:06:18,555 --> 00:06:20,295
40% of cost reduction.

91
00:06:20,355 --> 00:06:25,185
By leveraging serverless computing,
we pay only for what we use.

92
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:31,590
Reducing the need for expenses on
premises servers and also multi-cloud

93
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:36,720
strategy utilizing multiple cloud
providers, ensuring redundancy,

94
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:42,740
prevents outage, and helps company to
compile with regional data regulations.

95
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,895
For example, a tradition bank
that use it to take day two.

96
00:06:47,395 --> 00:06:52,275
The settlement payments can now
process them in real time thanks

97
00:06:52,275 --> 00:06:53,715
to our cloud infrastructure.

98
00:06:54,645 --> 00:07:00,035
Now that we have covered scalability
and cloud efficiency, let's talk about

99
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:02,015
what really matters to customers.

100
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:04,985
Personalized financial services.

101
00:07:05,855 --> 00:07:06,695
Let's move to it.

102
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,835
Coming to personalized
financial services, ai.

103
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,170
AI driven financial is.

104
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,200
Reshaping the way customers manage
their money in by investment strategies.

107
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,020
Coming to depth management
clients using our platform.

108
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,330
Save an average of 15%
on interest payments.

109
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:37,170
Through optimized repayment strategies,
coming to financial planning, predictive

110
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:42,390
modeling helps people prepare for
life's financial uncertainties.

111
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:46,810
To support these intelligent
financial services, we need

112
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,570
a rock solid DevOps strategy.

113
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,080
Let's take a look at how we achieve that.

114
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,150
we all know about DevOps
coming to, for the.

115
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,910
we all know about DevOps, right?

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,320
DevOps excellence.

117
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,350
Without DevOps, no one or none of
these innovations would be possible.

118
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:11,910
95 percentage of test coverage before
deploying any code by insuring zero

119
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,800
downtime deployment, using blue
green deployment strategies and also

120
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,390
realtime monitoring allows us to.

121
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:24,715
Detect resolve issues before
customers even notice.

122
00:08:25,215 --> 00:08:31,535
The result is faster and innovation,
greater reliability and happier customers.

123
00:08:32,465 --> 00:08:36,895
Another key technology driving
trustees, FinTech in blockchain.

124
00:08:37,674 --> 00:08:39,865
Let's see how we are integrating it.

125
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:44,795
Coming to blockchain integration,
blockchain is transforming financial

126
00:08:44,795 --> 00:08:48,905
transactions by introducing
greater trust and transparency.

127
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:55,635
Smart contracts are like, it
eliminates middleman and reducing

128
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,660
cost by 30% on risk assessment.

129
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:05,225
Every transaction is permanently recorded,
preventing fraud and insured compliance.

130
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:10,285
Adapt to market contracts, our
system dynamically responds to

131
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:14,175
market in fluctuations in real time.

132
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:19,794
Speaking of fraud, let's take a
closer look at how we can stop

133
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:22,434
financial crimes before they happen.

134
00:09:22,934 --> 00:09:23,594
let's move to.

135
00:09:24,094 --> 00:09:28,704
Fraud detection systems fraud remains
one of the biggest challenging

136
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:34,104
in FinTech as all we know, and we
take it seriously, to resolve this.

137
00:09:35,004 --> 00:09:41,244
Microsecond monitoring transactions
are analyzed in real time to

138
00:09:41,244 --> 00:09:43,554
prevent fraud before it happens.

139
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:45,614
AI powered detections.

140
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:49,784
Our models continuously learn
from millions of past fraud

141
00:09:49,784 --> 00:09:51,974
items and improve the accuracy.

142
00:09:52,474 --> 00:09:56,334
The fraud ion is by 60 th 63%.

143
00:09:56,934 --> 00:10:02,124
Banks using our systems help cut
fraud losses by nearly two third,

144
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:04,694
but stopping fraud isn't enough.

145
00:10:04,784 --> 00:10:07,994
We also have to meet strict regulatory.

146
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:09,389
Requirements.

147
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:12,739
So let's jump into regulatory Confluence.

148
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:18,879
Compliance isn't just about following
rules, it's about protecting business

149
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,609
and all our customers, 99.7% accuracy.

150
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:27,724
In EML screening, we flag
suspicious transactions instantly.

00:10:28,224 --> 00:10:29,509
KYC in 40 seconds.

152
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:31,229
Customers onboard.

153
00:10:31,794 --> 00:10:33,024
In under a minute.

154
00:10:33,114 --> 00:10:37,244
Instead of days, 98% less manual work.

155
00:10:37,744 --> 00:10:41,814
Compliance teams save hundreds
of hours through automation.

156
00:10:42,314 --> 00:10:48,699
Now coming to measurable business
outcomes, oh, 78% faster processing

157
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:51,819
transaction happened almost instantly.

158
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:58,099
63% of road reduction, greater
security, and low risk, 89%

159
00:10:58,489 --> 00:11:03,109

00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:08,389
42% cost savings by less
infrastructure waste and more

161
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:10,839
efficiency coming to conclusion.

162
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:14,949
How do we make financial systems
faster, smarter, and safer?

163
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:21,679
The all out of this we can say is
like with help of AI driven and cloud

164
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:24,409
powered and go based infrastructure.

165
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:29,944
Thank you everyone for attending
the session and I would

166
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:32,019
like to take any questions.

167
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,119
Thank you all.
