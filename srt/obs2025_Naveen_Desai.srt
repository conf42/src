00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,680
Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:07,170
Today I'm excited to present our work on
AI power observability and semiconductor

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:15,520
design, and how it's driving real time
insights and up to 40% fast design cycles

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,650
through advanced monitoring and analytics.

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,430
So let's begin by looking at the
challenges our industry faces.

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,000
Currently, 87% of our
semiconductor projects experience

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,860
delays and exceeding budgets.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,980
Often by several million dollars.

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,170
These setbacks have a direct impact
on time to market profitability

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,970
and innovation velocity.

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,580
But here's the opportunity.

12
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:41,230
With AI driven, we have a potential
to reduce design cycles by 40%.

13
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,940
Fundamentally changing the pace and
efficiency of chief development now.

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,720
Exactly.

15
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,129
Do we have.

16
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:48,449
AI observability.

17
00:00:48,914 --> 00:00:53,984
The approach delivers tangible
improvements in design cycle time, power

18
00:00:53,984 --> 00:00:55,994
consumption, and manufacturing yield.

19
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:57,675
These aren't just metrics.

20
00:00:57,675 --> 00:01:01,425
They transfer directly into a faster
product launches, lower operational cost,

21
00:01:01,425 --> 00:01:03,344
and better performing chips in the field.

22
00:01:03,844 --> 00:01:06,784
So let's drive into how we achieve this.

23
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:09,264
First, design automation monitoring.

24
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:14,034
Our AI powered monitoring system
significantly reduces design, providing

25
00:01:14,154 --> 00:01:19,044
real time feedback to catch issues early
by optimizing workload dynamically.

26
00:01:19,044 --> 00:01:23,234
And then we announce computational
efficiency across teams second

27
00:01:23,354 --> 00:01:25,334
productive telemetric systems.

28
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:30,794
We use real time pattern recognition to
detect critical design anomalies with

29
00:01:30,794 --> 00:01:35,144
multidimensional data and sensor networks,
we reduce physical testing needs while

30
00:01:35,144 --> 00:01:36,704
improving fall detection electricity.

31
00:01:37,204 --> 00:01:39,754
Third, automated design rule verification.

32
00:01:40,264 --> 00:01:43,864
Our tools achieve improved error
detection by continuously scanning and

33
00:01:43,864 --> 00:01:45,844
learning from complex design patterns.

34
00:01:46,354 --> 00:01:50,524
AI not only flags issues, but
suggest mark context of our fixes and

35
00:01:50,524 --> 00:01:52,624
optimization based in industry standards.

36
00:01:53,124 --> 00:01:55,884
Four, performance and power optimization.

37
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:59,324
Through real time monitoring, we deliver
immediate throughput improvements

38
00:01:59,324 --> 00:02:00,704
and intelligent power management.

39
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:04,424
We are enabling active frequency,
scaling action, and proactive

40
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:07,964
thermal management, all critical
for modern power, low power designs.

41
00:02:08,464 --> 00:02:09,754
Fifth simulation.

42
00:02:10,254 --> 00:02:14,274
Using digital twin environments, we
achieve near total test coverage,

43
00:02:14,304 --> 00:02:16,404
enabling massive power simulations.

44
00:02:16,524 --> 00:02:19,674
This reduces cycle time and
integrates insight across electrical,

45
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:21,504
thermal, and mechanical domains.

46
00:02:22,404 --> 00:02:24,294
Sixth yield optimization.

47
00:02:24,564 --> 00:02:27,534
We are tapping into over a
hundred process parameters

48
00:02:27,534 --> 00:02:29,454
through manufacturing, telemetry.

49
00:02:29,964 --> 00:02:33,349
Machine learning helps identify
different patterns with higher accuracy

50
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:36,829
and enables automated unit for higher
yields and reduced calibration.

51
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:39,819
Seventh edge device performance.

52
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:42,849
Our system collects telemetry
from deployed chips under

53
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:44,139
real world conditions.

54
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:48,669
This enables dynamic optimization, boost
ML performance, and extends battery

55
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,799
life without sacrificing functionality.

56
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:53,824
So how do we implement all of this?

57
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:58,544
The roadmap assessment phase, we
start with detailed cap analysis

58
00:02:58,684 --> 00:03:00,304
and define measurable KPIs.

59
00:03:00,804 --> 00:03:01,884
Integration phase.

60
00:03:02,384 --> 00:03:06,224
Next, we roll out Observ tools with
minimal workflow disruption backed by

61
00:03:06,224 --> 00:03:09,154
team training, third optimization phase.

62
00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:14,224
Finally, we use AI insight to define
process, build productive models,

63
00:03:14,224 --> 00:03:16,054
and share knowledge across products.

64
00:03:16,554 --> 00:03:20,325
In conclusion, AI power is
no longer a feature concept.

65
00:03:20,445 --> 00:03:21,195
It's practical.

66
00:03:21,195 --> 00:03:24,375
I impact solution that is already
arriving faster, design cycles,

67
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,995
better products, and smart engine.

68
00:03:26,495 --> 00:03:27,005
Thank you.

69
00:03:27,505 --> 00:03:29,185
Thank you for your time and
thank you for listening.
