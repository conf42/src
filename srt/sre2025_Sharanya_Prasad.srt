00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,160
Hello everybody.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,880
Welcome to Con 42 SRE Conference.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm Shania Prasad, a senior product
manager at Cisco Systems, and I'm really

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,120
excited to be here and present to you all.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,580
The topic for today is building
resilient digital infrastructures,

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,410
integrating networking and security
for agile secure operations.

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,600
So let's get right into it.

8
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:33,795
We are combining networking and
security in a smart, flexible way

9
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:39,195
so that businesses can run securely
and adapt quickly to change instead

10
00:00:39,195 --> 00:00:43,785
of treating these as separate silos,
for example, a network team and a

11
00:00:43,785 --> 00:00:48,105
security team working independently,
they're being brought together so

12
00:00:48,105 --> 00:00:50,355
everything works smoothly and securely.

13
00:00:54,044 --> 00:00:58,485
Here we've dug deep into some
statistics to understand why this

14
00:00:58,485 --> 00:01:02,385
is important and what returns an
organization can expect to get.

15
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:08,985
Organizations that take this approach
of a unified networking and security

16
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:11,610
can see a 15% reduction in breach costs.

17
00:01:12,195 --> 00:01:17,685
That is because integrated systems help
detect and respond faster, minimizing both

18
00:01:17,685 --> 00:01:20,265
financial loss and reputational damage.

19
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,670
They can also achieve faster containment.

20
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,280
For example, let's say ransomware
starts spreading inside a network.

21
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,980
An integrated setup can automatically
segment the threat, threat, alert

22
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,690
the right teams and block lateral
movements all in a fraction of

23
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,790
time compared to silo tools.

24
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:46,470
And they can also
experience better incidents.

25
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:50,669
Management teams can work
cross-functionally with better

26
00:01:50,669 --> 00:01:53,070
visibility, governance, compliance.

27
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:57,929
No more chasing data across
dis disconnected systems.

28
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,820
In short, integration is
not just about efficiency.

29
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,994
It directly improves your ability
to respond to threats, protect

30
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,729
your business, and stay agile.

31
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:18,120
With that, let's talk about a lot of
these key convergence technologies that

32
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,290
are coming together in the industry
such as software defined networking,

33
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,660
secure Access, service Edge, or
sass, e and zero trust architecture.

34
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:34,320
These three technologies are reshaping
how we build secure agile infrastructure.

35
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:38,864
Software-defined networking brings
programmability into the network,

36
00:02:38,894 --> 00:02:43,605
making it easier to scale, automate,
and adapt as business needs change.

37
00:02:44,204 --> 00:02:49,994
It's like moving from static roadmaps
to real time traffic control, SSE on

38
00:02:49,994 --> 00:02:54,704
the other hand, and brings networking
and security together in the cloud.

39
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,970
It's how companies can protect their
users and applications at the edge without

40
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,500
back howling all their traffic or adding
complexity for security inspection.

41
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,630
Zero.

42
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,935
Trust architecture is something that
you may all have heard a lot of it.

43
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,420
It changes the security model entirely.

44
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,655
Nobody is trusted by default.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,850
Every user device request name, it has
to be verified each and every time.

46
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,460
And their posture is being tracked
consistently and new policies are new.

47
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,930
Policies are applied every single
time the posture changes together.

48
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,220
These will form the backbone of a
modern converged infrastructure,

49
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,260
one that is secure, flexible, and
built for the way that we work today.

50
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,010
With this, let's start
looking at some market trends.

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,030
Where technologies are
gaining a lot of traction.

52
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:00,420
This chart is highlighting the projected
growth of the security service edge

53
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,940
market over the next five years, and the
trend is clear demand is accelerating.

54
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,280
What is driving this?

55
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,410
The shift to hybrid work, increased
resilience on cloud applications,

56
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:18,300
the need to secure users and data
outside the traditional parameter

57
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,070
is all driving this change.

58
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:26,070
Organizations are looking for integrated
cloud delivered security that scales, and

59
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,335
SSE is right at the center of that demand.

60
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:35,820
As the market nearly triples between now
and 2028, it's clear this isn't just a

61
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,130
passing trend, it's a strategic shift.

62
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,030
And vendors who can deliver this
convergence across networking and

63
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,340
security are best positioned to lead.

64
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:47,430
Great.

65
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:54,330
Now let's move in to understand a little
more about this entire process and how the

66
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,940
silos are, uh, formed in the first place.

67
00:04:58,065 --> 00:05:04,125
This pyramid here illustrates the journey
from siloed operations to two integration.

68
00:05:05,895 --> 00:05:11,535
Why does this matter for security and
operational effectiveness at the base?

69
00:05:11,535 --> 00:05:14,055
As you can see, we have siloed operations.

70
00:05:14,055 --> 00:05:17,625
When networking and security are
managed by separate teams, they have

71
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:21,915
different tools, different goals, and
often they have limited communication.

72
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,540
This is where many organizations start,
and it's where the friction, blind spots,

73
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,400
and delayed responses tend to live.

74
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:36,120
The first step in all of this is adopting
common tools, bringing teams into shared

75
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,100
platforms so they can at least work on the
same data and use consistent technologies.

76
00:05:41,535 --> 00:05:45,330
It is not full integration yet,
but it builds a foundation.

77
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:52,724
Next step is where organizations begin
aligning processes, harmonizing workflows,

78
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:55,005
handoffs, and incidents response.

79
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:58,905
This removes the guesswork and
finger pointing that slow teams

80
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:00,794
down when time matters the most.

81
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:06,090
At the top of the pyramid, we reach
integrated teams where networking and

82
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:11,039
security professionals are not just
coexisting, but collaborating as one.

83
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,380
This is where we see the greatest gains in
agility, risk reduction, and performance.

84
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,750
Security becomes proactive.

85
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,549
Networking becomes intelligence.

86
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,100
And together they create a
much stronger defense posture.

87
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,050
So the message here is simple.

88
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:34,470
True security convergence isn't about the
tools, it's about people and processes.

89
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:39,900
And the higher you climb, the stronger
and more resilient your operations become.

90
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:49,380
So now let's start with understanding
the operational benefits.

91
00:06:50,865 --> 00:06:53,865
To begin with, we can talk
about enhanced performance.

92
00:06:54,734 --> 00:06:59,055
When security is directly built
into your network, traffic can flow

93
00:06:59,055 --> 00:07:01,065
more effectively and efficiently.

94
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,284
There's no unnecessary detours.

95
00:07:03,615 --> 00:07:07,635
There are fewer bottlenecks and
there's faster application access.

96
00:07:08,265 --> 00:07:12,255
Users get a better experience without
compromising on the protection.

97
00:07:13,665 --> 00:07:16,245
Next there is faster response.

98
00:07:16,755 --> 00:07:22,335
Integrated systems can detect threats in
real time and act immediately, whether

99
00:07:22,335 --> 00:07:27,915
that means isolating a device, blocking
traffic, triggering alerts, you name it.

100
00:07:28,545 --> 00:07:32,745
The days of slow manual
handoffs between teams are gone.

101
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:35,925
Next is cost efficiency.

102
00:07:36,705 --> 00:07:41,595
When you consolidate tools and unify
processes, you're reducing redundancy.

103
00:07:41,885 --> 00:07:46,955
Not just in licensing costs, but
in overheads, in training, in

104
00:07:46,984 --> 00:07:49,025
operational complexity, and so on.

105
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:52,505
You are doing more with
fewer moving parts.

106
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:56,914
The final thing I wanna talk
about here is stronger protection.

107
00:07:57,555 --> 00:08:02,625
A unified approach closes the gaps
that attackers can often exploit.

108
00:08:03,045 --> 00:08:08,895
You get consistent policies, broader
visibility and seamless convergence across

109
00:08:08,895 --> 00:08:13,515
users, devices, and location, whether
they're on-prem, remote, or in the cloud.

110
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:18,225
So these aren't just technical
improvements that actually business

111
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:24,285
enablers, performance, speed,
savings, security all together.

112
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:25,125
When.

113
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:30,975
They come together improving the whole
system, the silos start to come down.

114
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:40,635
In this slide, we're gonna
talk about AI and how that is

115
00:08:40,784 --> 00:08:42,914
covering this entire system.

116
00:08:44,445 --> 00:08:48,645
As threats grow more complex and
more faster, traditional security

117
00:08:48,645 --> 00:08:50,475
models are not able to keep up.

118
00:08:51,225 --> 00:08:56,595
This is where AI powered convergence
steps in turning reactive operations

119
00:08:56,715 --> 00:08:59,655
into proactive, intelligent defense.

120
00:09:00,225 --> 00:09:02,535
It starts with threat detection.

121
00:09:03,495 --> 00:09:09,645
AI constantly scans network traffic and
behavior patterns to spot anomalies,

122
00:09:10,065 --> 00:09:13,500
things as humans might miss, but that.

123
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:20,760
Will stand out any day, right, because
it's, it's done by a machine and it's

124
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,620
trained on millions of data points.

125
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:26,010
From there, we move to analysis.

126
00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:33,840
Machine learning engines evaluate these
anomalies, filtering noise from risk.

127
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:38,490
They reduce false positives and
give security teams clarity.

128
00:09:38,939 --> 00:09:40,590
They're not drowning in alerts.

129
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,215
They're focusing on threats that matter.

130
00:09:44,595 --> 00:09:45,915
Then comes response.

131
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:51,645
With integrated systems, AI can take
immediate action, whether that's isolating

132
00:09:51,645 --> 00:09:58,335
a device, blocking, suspicious activity,
or escalating to human for review, the

133
00:09:58,335 --> 00:10:04,360
key is speed, minutes, or even seconds
can make a huge difference in the impact.

134
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:06,975
And finally, adaptation.

135
00:10:07,395 --> 00:10:09,915
AI doesn't just react, it actually learns.

136
00:10:10,155 --> 00:10:14,355
Every incident makes a system
smarter, turning detection models

137
00:10:14,355 --> 00:10:16,725
and response playbooks automatically.

138
00:10:17,445 --> 00:10:21,705
The more data that it sees, the better
it gets at defending your environment.

139
00:10:22,305 --> 00:10:26,295
So this isn't just automation,
it's intelligence at scale.

140
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,560
AI is bridging the gap between
networking and security, accelerating

141
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:37,500
detection, reducing the manual
effort required, and also improving

142
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,750
resilience with every single incident.

143
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:50,520
As we talk about the benefits of
convergence, it's equally important to

144
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:56,010
acknowledge the real world challenges
that any organization might face

145
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:57,900
when they're trying to implement it.

146
00:10:59,564 --> 00:11:01,365
First, there is a skills gap.

147
00:11:01,665 --> 00:11:05,714
There is a clear shortage of
professionals with expertise across

148
00:11:05,714 --> 00:11:07,545
both networking and security.

149
00:11:07,995 --> 00:11:13,245
Only 24% of IT professionals are
proficient in both the domains.

150
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:17,329
This makes it very
difficult to design, deploy.

151
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:23,245
Manage converge solutions without
upskilling or bringing in outside help.

152
00:11:24,115 --> 00:11:28,705
Bridging that gap requires
training, investments and closer

153
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:30,625
collaboration across teams.

154
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:34,315
Second challenge can be legacy systems.

155
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:39,355
Most organizations are still running
on outdated infrastructure that

156
00:11:39,355 --> 00:11:41,185
was not built for integration.

157
00:11:42,105 --> 00:11:46,695
These environments lack compatibility
with modern security frameworks,

158
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:51,675
making convergence very difficult,
and it's like retrofitting a jet

159
00:11:51,675 --> 00:11:53,505
engine into a propeller plane.

160
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:58,545
Moving forward means serious
investment, not just in tech, but

161
00:11:58,575 --> 00:12:04,665
in rethinking architectures and
third organizational resistance.

162
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,510
Even with the right tools and
people, culture can be a blocker.

163
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,740
Networking and security teams often
operate in silos, as I mentioned

164
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,060
earlier, each with their own
priorities, tools and ways of working.

165
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,930
Merging them requires more
than just a technical plan.

166
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,160
It takes change management,
execute a sponsorship and a shared

167
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,680
vision of what success looks like.

168
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:33,465
The good news though is that
these challenges are solvable,

169
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:37,395
but only when they're addressed
head on with clear strategy.

170
00:12:37,395 --> 00:12:41,565
That includes people, processes,
and program alignment.

171
00:12:44,685 --> 00:12:50,475
Let's now move into understanding
Cloud native security integration.

172
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:57,465
Securing cloud environments is not just
about lifting and shifting existing tools.

173
00:12:58,005 --> 00:13:03,735
It requires a fundamentally new approach,
one that is built into the cloud, cloud

174
00:13:03,735 --> 00:13:08,115
fabric from day one, and that's what
we're gonna talk about in this slide.

175
00:13:09,495 --> 00:13:12,045
First, we're gonna talk about
identity, identity-based access.

176
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,600
A distributed world users are everywhere.

177
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,070
Working from home on mobile
across SaaS and cloud platforms.

178
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,320
The parameter is no longer physical.

179
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,750
It's identity that matters.

180
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:30,240
That means policies must follow the user
and not the device or the data center.

181
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,290
Identity becomes the
control plane for security.

182
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,220
Next, distributed security devices.

183
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:42,224
In a cloud native environment,
traffic doesn't just pass through

184
00:13:42,224 --> 00:13:43,755
a central gateway anymore.

185
00:13:44,265 --> 00:13:49,755
Security must be embedded at every single
access point across users, devices,

186
00:13:49,755 --> 00:13:54,765
workloads, APIs, you name it, whether it
is east-west traffic within the cloud,

187
00:13:54,824 --> 00:13:57,015
or access from external endpoints.

188
00:13:57,314 --> 00:14:00,194
Protection has to be
everywhere and all the time.

189
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:06,495
Lastly, but not least, the cloud
network architecture itself.

190
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:10,635
Security cannot be bolted
as an afterthought.

191
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:15,015
It has to be part of the initial
infrastructure design integrated

192
00:14:15,015 --> 00:14:18,165
into the way that the services are
deployed, connected and scaled.

193
00:14:18,885 --> 00:14:24,315
This includes microsegmentation, service
meshes, and cloud native firewalls

194
00:14:24,315 --> 00:14:28,485
all embedded into the way that the
network operates in the first place.

195
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:34,725
The key takeaway here is that Cloud
Native security integration is

196
00:14:34,725 --> 00:14:37,395
proactive, scalable, and user centric.

197
00:14:37,935 --> 00:14:42,345
It's all about building security
in and not just bolting it on or

198
00:14:42,345 --> 00:14:46,365
adding it on, so that protection
becomes how the cloud works and not a

199
00:14:46,365 --> 00:14:48,135
separate process running alongside it.

200
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,444
Lemme try to give a real life example.

201
00:14:59,714 --> 00:15:02,025
Um, just to make this
a little more clearer.

202
00:15:02,324 --> 00:15:04,905
So we'll take an example from
the financial services sector.

203
00:15:06,435 --> 00:15:11,895
Let's say that a global bank was facing
a growing number of attacks across

204
00:15:11,895 --> 00:15:17,025
its distributed network, and this is a
challenge that only became more common

205
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:19,275
with hybrid work and cloud adaptation.

206
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,660
Now their biggest bottleneck wasn't
just the threats themselves, it

207
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,490
was the response to the threats.

208
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,820
The security and networking
teams were siloed.

209
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,400
They were working in parallel, but
they were not working together.

210
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,030
And that disconnect caused
delays in threat detection and

211
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,770
response, increasing the risk.

212
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:43,170
To fix this, the bank rolled out a SAS
E framework, combining networking and

213
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,910
security into a single architecture.

214
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:50,475
And they also paired that with
integrated SD-WAN to optimize

215
00:15:50,475 --> 00:15:52,755
networking and control at their edge.

216
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:54,944
But technology wasn't enough.

217
00:15:55,214 --> 00:15:59,895
They also stood up a joint network
operations center, bringing together

218
00:16:00,165 --> 00:16:03,045
both teams under a unified model.

219
00:16:04,094 --> 00:16:08,175
The impact of this was
immediate and measurable.

220
00:16:08,984 --> 00:16:12,584
They saw an immediate reduction
in the threat detection time

221
00:16:12,974 --> 00:16:16,094
from hours previously to minutes.

222
00:16:16,094 --> 00:16:23,744
Now, they cut a huge budget annually in
operational costs by eliminating redundant

223
00:16:23,864 --> 00:16:28,604
tools, streamlining their workflows,
and also improvised performance.

224
00:16:29,324 --> 00:16:32,564
They also got a boost
in network efficiency.

225
00:16:32,895 --> 00:16:38,385
Users got faster and more reliable access
without really compromising on security.

226
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:43,530
This, as you can see, is a clear
example of what convergence looks like

227
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:49,110
in practice and why just a technical
upgrade is not enough, but a it.

228
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,390
It's also a business enabler.

229
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,660
Finally, I just want to leave
you all with a few thoughts.

230
00:17:02,115 --> 00:17:07,005
When it comes to converging networking,
security success depends on having

231
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:09,375
a clear, actionable roadmap.

232
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,765
And this is what I'm gonna
talk about in this slide.

233
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:19,185
It starts with assessment, evaluating
whether your current state, your

234
00:17:19,185 --> 00:17:23,385
architecture, your tools, and your
organization silos are present.

235
00:17:24,435 --> 00:17:30,315
Uncovering where the gaps are and where
integration can drive the most value.

236
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:35,355
Many organizations find that they
have overlapping tools, fragmented

237
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:37,515
policies, and misaligned teams.

238
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:41,385
This is their chance to
reset the whole foundation.

239
00:17:42,555 --> 00:17:46,875
From there on, you can move into STR
strategy development, and this is

240
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:51,105
where you define the future state,
a unified framework that brings both

241
00:17:51,105 --> 00:17:52,845
security and networking together.

242
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,860
Again, it's not just about the technology.

243
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:01,290
It means defining the governance roles
and responsibilities so everyone knows how

244
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,149
they need to operate in this new model.

245
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,740
Next comes the pilot implementation.

246
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,860
Now, this is a very critical phase.

247
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:14,909
Rather than roll out everything
at once, you test integrated

248
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:18,565
solutions in smaller controlled
environments, you validate that.

249
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,540
That performance is actually improving.

250
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,350
Risk is decreasing, and
operations are getting simpler.

251
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:31,740
Then you gather feedback and fine tune
your system before a broader rollout.

252
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,480
Last but not the least, you move to a
full deployment in your organization.

253
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:44,580
At this point, you scale the proven
solution across the enterprise.

254
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,290
But you don't just stop there.

255
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:51,600
You establish a continuous improvement
loop because threats are going to keep

256
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,360
evolving and you so will the business.

257
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,230
So ongoing refinement will
keep you ahead of both.

258
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:05,940
The key takeaway here, and my ending
note here is that transformation does

259
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,400
not have to be risky or overwhelming.

260
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:13,650
Start small, measure the outcomes
and expand it with confidence.

261
00:19:15,105 --> 00:19:17,595
Thank you so much all
of you for being here.

262
00:19:17,745 --> 00:19:21,615
It was my pleasure to present to
all of you and I'd love to hear

263
00:19:21,615 --> 00:19:23,355
as well what your thoughts on.

264
00:19:24,315 --> 00:19:25,180
Thank you so much again.
