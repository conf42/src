00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,440
Speaker 37: Talking about how cloud
native architecture, DevOps, and

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,360
analytics can transform compliance
from provider network governance.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,460
In healthcare compliance is often
seen as constrained, but with the

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,550
right foundation, it becomes a driver
for sustainability efficiency and

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,560
better member access and building
compliance centric systems at scale.

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,470
Everything I shall share to today
comes from real world healthcare.

7
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,850
It challenges

8
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,630
regulatory pressure is growing faster.

9
00:00:35,529 --> 00:00:39,250
CMS requirements have grown
significantly in recent years.

10
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:45,100
While expectations are on cost
control, sustainability and member

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,960
experience continues to raise.

12
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,500
Organizations have moved to cloud.

13
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,249
Platforms have already seen
a meaningful gains in cost

14
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,440
efficiency and sustainability.

15
00:00:58,279 --> 00:01:03,499
But ma, but many ha, many are
still struggling to modernize

16
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:05,270
the compliance itself.

17
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,445
Speaker 38: There are three main

18
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:07,985
Speaker 37: challenges.

19
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:14,725
Regulatory changes continuously
in and legacy systems struggle to

20
00:01:14,725 --> 00:01:17,335
provide audit level transparency.

21
00:01:17,835 --> 00:01:22,005
When compliance is manual
and fragmented, the risk and

22
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:24,525
operational drag increases together.

23
00:01:25,025 --> 00:01:28,715
This is where the cloud native
architecture becomes critical.

24
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:33,895
Traditional on-premise systems are slow
to scale and expensive to maintain.

25
00:01:34,555 --> 00:01:41,725
The cloud native DevOps environment are
distributed, resilient, and designed to

26
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:45,225
continuous changes for compliant systems.

27
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:49,655
The flexibility is not,
is no longer optional.

28
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:50,884
It is essential.

29
00:01:51,384 --> 00:01:55,914
Once the foundation is in place,
the interoperability is key.

30
00:01:56,414 --> 00:02:03,695
Regulatory data from CMS state mandates
and internal rules must be unified

31
00:02:04,195 --> 00:02:10,070
data driven analytics, transform
from data into insights while cloud.

32
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,670
Native pipelines enables
continuous updates in real time

33
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,329
validation across the environments.

34
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:21,599
This approach delivers a real results.

35
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:25,399
We see a strong network
advocacy monitoring, and

36
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:30,609
faster provider onboarding, and
significant reduced audit risk.

37
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:37,559
Automation shifts compliance from active
reporting to proactive governance.

38
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:41,599
Analytics directly impacts
provider governance.

39
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:47,799
Higher directory accuracy reduces
claim denials and administrative

40
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,149
friction clean continuously.

41
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:55,579
Validated data leads to better
member experience and higher

42
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:57,859
satisfaction across the networks.

43
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:00,640
Credentialing is one of the biggest win.

44
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:07,154
Automated intakes, parallel verification
and real-time compliance checks

45
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,844
dramatically reduce onboarding time.

46
00:03:10,344 --> 00:03:16,015
Provider moves from applications
to network activity activation

47
00:03:16,015 --> 00:03:19,254
faster with a fewer hands off.

48
00:03:19,755 --> 00:03:24,044
DevOps make all these
sustainable version controlled.

49
00:03:24,464 --> 00:03:25,815
Compliance changes.

50
00:03:26,144 --> 00:03:26,954
Automated.

51
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:32,944
Automated testing proceeds data
integrity during regulatory updates

52
00:03:33,515 --> 00:03:40,204
and continuous monitoring helps detect
compliance drift along before audits

53
00:03:41,044 --> 00:03:44,364
reliable directories compliance, improve

54
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:45,504
Speaker 38: directory transfer.

55
00:03:46,004 --> 00:03:46,604
Transparency

56
00:03:47,054 --> 00:03:49,244
Speaker 37: into better member outcomes.

57
00:03:49,744 --> 00:03:52,594
Modern system create
transparency for everyone.

58
00:03:53,094 --> 00:03:59,514
Regulators get realtime dashboards,
provider gets self-service visibility,

59
00:03:59,514 --> 00:04:02,094
and member gets accurate information.

60
00:04:02,594 --> 00:04:07,274
A shared source of truth reduces
the friction across ecosystem.

61
00:04:07,774 --> 00:04:12,354
These transformation helps in
phases, starts with assessment,

62
00:04:12,445 --> 00:04:14,904
design, scalability, architecture,

63
00:04:15,404 --> 00:04:19,484
migrate incrementally, and optimization.

64
00:04:19,984 --> 00:04:25,025
The key is minimizing distribu
while enabling long-term.

65
00:04:25,429 --> 00:04:31,890
Agility to summarize the cloud and
DevOps enable regulatory agility

66
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,379
and analytics turn compliance
into governance intelligence.

67
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:42,869
The results are measurable, lower risk,
better efficiency, improved member

68
00:04:42,869 --> 00:04:46,139
access, and intra optimal system.

69
00:04:46,844 --> 00:04:50,924
Provider, a scalable function for future.

70
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:56,224
Thank you for your time and
you have enjoyed my session.

71
00:04:56,724 --> 00:05:00,114
If you have any questions,
I'm happy to take it.

72
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:00,444
Thank you.
