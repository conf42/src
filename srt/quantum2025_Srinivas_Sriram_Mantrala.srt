1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,920
Good morning and good evening, and across
the audience who is watching my video.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,120
Many thanks for taking your
time to watch my recording.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,189
I'm going to present today about
the cloud quantum Cloud Ops.

4
00:00:13,579 --> 00:00:15,529
It's basically about the future.

5
00:00:15,774 --> 00:00:20,044
Technology that is coming up which
we are going to envision tomorrow in

6
00:00:20,044 --> 00:00:24,335
another, I, maybe in max of another five
years, we'll be seeing more about this

7
00:00:24,335 --> 00:00:26,345
quantum processing, quantum technology.

8
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:26,915
Quantum.

9
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:30,665
There'll be a revolutionary
coming up, which we have to

10
00:00:30,665 --> 00:00:31,895
be prepared for ourselves.

11
00:00:31,984 --> 00:00:36,085
Hence, I'm taking this opportunity
to give some insight how it can be

12
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:41,365
and what we can be achieving more in
future and let's we welcome you all.

13
00:00:41,795 --> 00:00:43,985
And let's dive into the presentation.

14
00:00:44,485 --> 00:00:47,605
It's basically and the this
is more, I just want to cover

15
00:00:47,605 --> 00:00:49,405
up my last, that small line.

16
00:00:49,885 --> 00:00:54,155
It's basically to see the quantum
computing with basically we have our

17
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:55,955
cloud infrastructure, we have our DevOps.

18
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,230
Now with quantum technology coming
into place, how this amalgamation can

19
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,150
revolutionize the whole computer process,
the computer technology and the, it may

20
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,520
even come to our everyday day-to-day life.

21
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:13,280
This impacts, that's the intent of this
whole this one before I go into this

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,445
and I would like to take in a small
opportunity to explain what is this

23
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,620
quantum technology and everything the.

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,660
Processing.

25
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:24,790
It's, it is coming from a physics,
actually speaking it in this, right now

26
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:29,290
we have a traditional, I will call it
as a convention conventional processing,

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,710
which will basically and our computer
basically is a binary, it's a zero one.

28
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,700
One of the state will be there and
hence will be processing based on that.

29
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,730
But in quantum, it has it, the unit,
the small unit of work is called qubit.

30
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:43,440
It.

31
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,860
It basically has both the
values of zero and one.

32
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,900
It simultaneously can be in zero
and one that is called as a qubit,

33
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:55,620
and, but in case of a convention,
our traditional we'll have either

34
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,345
a zero or one, the binary, hence.

35
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:00,875
Based on that zero or one
the processing logical error.

36
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:06,335
But in quantum being in position of
both zero or one at any time until we

37
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:11,675
measure it, that is cause a super ion
and that super ion that makes quantum

38
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:15,005
to really prob give that flex that.

39
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,550
Upliftment of processing,
paralleling multiple tasks.

40
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:24,200
And that really gives us robustness
of this processing technology.

41
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,020
And that's where many companies
are investing on this.

42
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,810
The fundamentals of where it started with
physics and now they're putting a lot of

43
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,295
research projects so that we can really.

44
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:41,345
You leverage that processing technique and
make our the complex processing that we

45
00:02:41,345 --> 00:02:47,435
really, not even with this ai, the complex
processing, so we have, the technology

46
00:02:47,555 --> 00:02:51,755
is evolving, but if the underneath the
processing technology, like the processors

47
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,555
are not incapable, we are going to.

48
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,860
Hinder our technology.

49
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,250
That's the reason if the quantum
processing comes in place and with the

50
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,030
ai, we are really going to revolutionize
this whole, that's the intent of

51
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,680
where this whole exercise is going on.

52
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,620
And along with that, even the security,
right now we have a security with the

53
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:14,150
con, the convention approach of encryption
algorithm, but applying, thinking about

54
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:19,400
the quantum technology applying on the
top of it, the security will really the

55
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,530
increase, the 10 folds, a hundred folds.

56
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:27,050
So the thought the chances of getting
a threats will get reduced drastically

57
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,100
because it can really envision.

58
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,660
For example, I can, I'll go
more detail in the example so

59
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,040
that you can really understand.

60
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,750
I have a small example to going forward
how this security can, security or

61
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,020
processing, how this parallel processing
is happening with the content and

62
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,420
how we are getting benefited out.

63
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,210
That, I'll go with the other
thing which I want to talk about

64
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,010
is the innovation catalyst.

65
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,100
It'll even help us to, that we could not
dreamt that, hey, we can do this type

66
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,680
of complex processing with this quantum.

67
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,480
We can really feel conscious.

68
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,740
We can even achieve that one.

69
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,080
That's one of the, one of the security.

70
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,890
The other one is a performance and
the other one is the new innovation.

71
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,730
It'll lose.

72
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:13,539
It gives a a foundation for us to
think about some innovation that

73
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:14,709
we never could ever to dream about.

74
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,109
That is the intent of the whole quantum.

75
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:18,760
Let's move to the.

76
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,860
Next slide.

77
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:20,820
Quantum.

78
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:22,110
Sorry.

79
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,510
The hybrid infra architecture.

80
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:30,450
So we have our cloud infrastructure
currently, and we have our CICD

81
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,870
pipelines which were original DevOps,
and then we moved to the cloud.

82
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,614
Now everything is on cloud now, we
call it as a. Cloud ops tomorrow.

83
00:04:39,824 --> 00:04:44,414
I think maybe it, maybe call a
quantum ops or anything, but the

84
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:48,794
point is, in quantum the main
important is unit processing unit.

85
00:04:48,794 --> 00:04:53,034
Basically the qubit I'm
talking about, it'll enable us.

86
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:57,769
The foundation that is being, that
is laid on top of which quantum

87
00:04:57,769 --> 00:05:02,024
is built, that will really help
us to really execute complex.

88
00:05:02,494 --> 00:05:06,064
Quantum algorithms leveraging the
power of supervision, the supervision

89
00:05:06,154 --> 00:05:10,264
I was talking about having, being in
both zero and one at the same time.

90
00:05:10,264 --> 00:05:14,529
That's a supervision, which is calling
Quantum and the other one is entanglement.

91
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:19,119
There's another concept where I can
example like I, I'll take more time.

92
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:21,909
So in Quantum, basically.

93
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:26,129
Generally we have our zero one
comp processing, but in quantum

94
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:30,989
at a given moment of time, a a
state can be in zero and one both.

95
00:05:30,989 --> 00:05:33,629
And it leverages both
the state and to process.

96
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:35,129
And that is called a superposition.

97
00:05:35,489 --> 00:05:37,394
And that small you need to work of cubit.

98
00:05:37,544 --> 00:05:40,594
Okay, now think about many.

99
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:45,749
When a chess player or when you are
playing a chess, generally when I play

100
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:50,489
chess or anyone I can really envision
or I can think about the 10 moves my

101
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:55,739
opponent can think about, I feel hey,
he may be doing this or he may, if

102
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:57,329
he does this, I may need to do this.

103
00:05:57,329 --> 00:06:01,379
If I did this, I may need to do,
there are 10 combination max I can

104
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:06,719
think about, but think about if for
one of the 10 position, if it picks.

105
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:10,244
What are the other possible
10 options that can come?

106
00:06:10,394 --> 00:06:14,774
I only can think one seamless, but
in quantum being in state of the

107
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,354
super position, what is advantages?

108
00:06:17,684 --> 00:06:21,074
If the opponent takes one of this
10 position, what are the other

109
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:24,134
10 combination that can come and
from the 10 position, what are 10?

110
00:06:24,494 --> 00:06:29,204
So it really takes a whole bandwidth
of combination and then process it,

111
00:06:29,534 --> 00:06:32,234
and then it'll give us a result,
Hey, this is something that is

112
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:34,454
coming up, which is a future risk.

113
00:06:34,544 --> 00:06:35,439
That level of.

114
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:38,639
Bandwidth of processing is what
is achieved, can be achieved.

115
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:41,079
That is called, is a complex processing.

116
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:44,799
That is being, that level of thought
process or processing is enabled

117
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:47,079
in the quantum that if we know.

118
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:52,679
Apply this processing to
security, you are able to envision

119
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:53,909
for certain security threat.

120
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:57,119
But think about if that security
threat comes or what is the

121
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:59,879
other thing that can come up with
this if there is another what?

122
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:07,199
So thinking ahead of multiple combination
with this quantum processing will really

123
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,649
help us to really take a proactive step.

124
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:14,809
How we can make the threats not coming
up from a security from a. Cloud

125
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:20,459
infrastructure operations management
point of view, or even financial, or

126
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:24,839
even in medical, everywhere you can
think about in everywhere, if you

127
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:29,449
look, really apply, if you increase
the scope of your bandwidth, of the.

128
00:07:29,974 --> 00:07:34,874
Different health conditions wide wide
span, then you can really think about

129
00:07:35,384 --> 00:07:37,604
what is the best approach for me to take.

130
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:41,324
Hence, that complex process is not
allowed because of the way we are

131
00:07:41,324 --> 00:07:43,214
currently, the current processes.

132
00:07:43,544 --> 00:07:47,954
But with this quantum processes, we
can take that leap and we can really

133
00:07:48,224 --> 00:07:53,114
go forward and take more steps and
take a proactive step now for the

134
00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:54,674
future that is coming in the risk.

135
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,534
That's the intent of the processing unit.

136
00:07:57,104 --> 00:07:59,539
The classical infrastructure
basically is about talking about

137
00:07:59,654 --> 00:08:01,244
our cloud infrastructure currently.

138
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:05,999
We have a cloud infrastructure that
delivers the convention, computer task

139
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:07,740
and system orchestration right now.

140
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:12,286
Applying the, we would like to leverage
the same approach that DevOps or CloudOps,

141
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,200
but apply on top of it, the cloud the
quantum, and so that we can really, I.

142
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,085
How the load balancing properly
distribute the workloads.

143
00:08:20,085 --> 00:08:23,745
With this integration of the quantum
and the classical infrastructure, we

144
00:08:23,745 --> 00:08:28,275
can really, what is the benefit we can
leave is we can really do the workloads,

145
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:32,295
distribution of and with the quantum
and classical optimal performance.

146
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:37,035
And the other one is with this small
integration layer, we can even,

147
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:40,335
it has the advanced translator,
workload, schedulers, and real time

148
00:08:40,335 --> 00:08:42,525
processing system that unify d.

149
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:44,705
Computer algorithms, execution.

150
00:08:44,705 --> 00:08:48,425
Also, basically the quantum
and the classical, both.

151
00:08:48,425 --> 00:08:53,175
If you combine, you really getting a
very good benefit of for example, the.

152
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:57,150
The workload balancing
operation management everywhere.

153
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,820
I'll go more in deep where I can explain
you in a pictorial how the benefit the

154
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,650
investment, how the investment is more,
but what is the benefit out of it?

155
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,990
We get more out of this investment.

156
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,660
I'll go in my future slides.

157
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,560
DevOps no, I'm sorry.

158
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,370
My missed mistake.

159
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,170
Now, coming to the DevOps, we
started with DevOps and then we

160
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,940
moved now to call as a cloud ops.

161
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,180
Now think about what is the
transformation we need to do in

162
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,040
order to be prepared for our quantum.

163
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,420
Basically, we need to upgrade
our CICD pipeline so that we can

164
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,240
leave the benefit of for example,
quantum deployment and testing.

165
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,410
We need to make our C so that
we can deploy this new setup.

166
00:09:37,585 --> 00:09:40,295
Quantum algorithm and
testing observability.

167
00:09:40,475 --> 00:09:43,145
We have this log metrics and
everything for our observability to

168
00:09:43,145 --> 00:09:47,405
make our operation life simple that
need to be enhanced for quantum.

169
00:09:47,885 --> 00:09:48,815
The other one is the.

170
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:52,175
The operations models, right?

171
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:56,805
We have a lot of operation models that
are defined for our current DevOps or

172
00:09:56,805 --> 00:10:01,756
CloudOps on-prem model on cloud that
need to be enhanced so that people need

173
00:10:01,756 --> 00:10:07,246
to be trained so that to understand
how to manage this operations for the

174
00:10:07,246 --> 00:10:09,366
quantum technology based applications.

175
00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:13,896
Then automation, we do a lot
of automation for our systems.

176
00:10:13,965 --> 00:10:16,515
To run automation to make
everything more smoother.

177
00:10:16,665 --> 00:10:19,786
That automation now need
to be enhanced by quantum.

178
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:23,825
We need, so it's more of skill
development, enhancing the

179
00:10:23,825 --> 00:10:26,885
existing processes that we
define, which are stabilized.

180
00:10:26,885 --> 00:10:31,205
Now we know how we can make
this APAs, for example.

181
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:34,585
We need to know how to build an
a p for a quantum processing.

182
00:10:34,975 --> 00:10:39,175
We need, because it cannot be same way
as late because quantum does more faster.

183
00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:43,636
So we need to change the way of your,
I feel even the program in languages

184
00:10:43,636 --> 00:10:45,586
like Java, they may even change.

185
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:49,836
With the quantum technology coming
up the way, the multi concurrent

186
00:10:49,836 --> 00:10:52,206
processing, the multi trading
everything, the implementation

187
00:10:52,206 --> 00:10:53,496
will change in a similar way.

188
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:55,591
Every technology will have its own.

189
00:10:56,091 --> 00:10:59,001
Change or adaptability because
of this quantum coming.

190
00:10:59,001 --> 00:11:04,911
And so we need to transform, be prepared,
and make ourself upscale, be prepared

191
00:11:04,911 --> 00:11:09,591
for the new approaches for the operation,
new approaches for the CSCD or new way

192
00:11:09,591 --> 00:11:13,491
of thinking of an observability so that
we can get more logs and do the data

193
00:11:13,491 --> 00:11:15,891
analytics to untake the proactive steps.

194
00:11:16,101 --> 00:11:19,906
This is basically how it can
impact the existing DevOps.

195
00:11:20,406 --> 00:11:23,466
The key industries that benefit
from, sorry, my mistake.

196
00:11:23,966 --> 00:11:28,466
The key industry that really that
benefits from this quantum, this

197
00:11:28,466 --> 00:11:33,686
basically is the security I. Because
developing the quantum resistance and

198
00:11:33,686 --> 00:11:38,186
encryption protocols to secure sensory
data against future quantum attacks,

199
00:11:38,636 --> 00:11:40,746
cryptographic, basically it's security.

200
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:46,356
That is one of the key factor that will be
benefited from this because it can really

201
00:11:46,356 --> 00:11:51,816
think about future combinations of threats
that can come and it'll help us a lot to

202
00:11:51,816 --> 00:11:53,786
reduce the cyber tech attacks coming down.

203
00:11:53,906 --> 00:11:56,611
The other one is the
algorithms, AI algorithms.

204
00:11:57,176 --> 00:11:58,171
We built AI algorithm.

205
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,551
Current existing processor technologies.

206
00:12:02,151 --> 00:12:03,681
Think of what quantum is coming in.

207
00:12:04,011 --> 00:12:08,301
So we definitely need to change
this AI algorithms so that we can

208
00:12:08,301 --> 00:12:12,411
leave the benefit of this parallel
processing that will be an impact.

209
00:12:12,951 --> 00:12:15,886
The other thing that will be major
impact is on the pharmaceutical.

210
00:12:16,656 --> 00:12:19,761
Right now, for example, in
Medicare medicine, need to

211
00:12:19,761 --> 00:12:21,711
be come outta the market.

212
00:12:21,771 --> 00:12:23,481
There has to do a lot of things.

213
00:12:24,031 --> 00:12:25,321
Clinical studies, everything.

214
00:12:25,321 --> 00:12:29,911
So one medicine to come out, it
may take years, but because they

215
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:35,191
don't have the liberty to do the
complex processing now they do the

216
00:12:35,191 --> 00:12:36,961
incremental steps, sequential step.

217
00:12:36,961 --> 00:12:41,851
But with this quantum, they can do the
concurrent execution of these studies.

218
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:46,261
They can do everything like
multiple ular combination to see

219
00:12:46,261 --> 00:12:47,641
where's the impact coming up.

220
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:52,041
Time will come down, hence the clinical
study will come down and that will really

221
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:57,381
help us to give even, it'll even break
through some of the complex monocles

222
00:12:57,381 --> 00:13:01,461
in combinations so that with this
quantum, and that may even bring some

223
00:13:01,461 --> 00:13:06,831
new innovation, maybe even we may get a
Medicare medicine for cancer or something.

224
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:10,611
But basically it really helps us to break
through some of the innovation that we

225
00:13:10,611 --> 00:13:12,711
never dreamt about with this quantum.

226
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,691
The other important thing on the finance.

227
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:20,291
As finance goes with the data analytics
pro, analyzing the data, predicting the

228
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:24,821
data, predicting the new future trends
of the market, is all based on the data.

229
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:29,441
And data need to be analyzed process
so that we can give the results.

230
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:34,021
We are limited with this conventional,
or we can say with this current

231
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:38,011
existing infrastructure, but with
this quantum infrastructure, you

232
00:13:38,011 --> 00:13:39,871
can really make a difference.

233
00:13:40,231 --> 00:13:41,731
It can even predict.

234
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:48,151
If I take this move for this something,
what is the future that, based on the

235
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:51,661
organization or based on the future
trends or based on the past tense

236
00:13:51,661 --> 00:13:56,531
of an organization, whether I have
to invest it makes more, not only

237
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:59,951
that, it may co bring the combination
of AI with this data analytics.

238
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:03,251
It may even give us a very
good edition of where to invest

239
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:04,151
in everything there may be.

240
00:14:04,421 --> 00:14:08,411
That's intent of where I'm going is the
quantum technology applying on finance

241
00:14:08,411 --> 00:14:13,111
will help a. It'll not only for me
investment point of view, it even helps

242
00:14:13,111 --> 00:14:20,671
for me this self, my portfolio and risk
assessment based on this analysis, whether

243
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:24,871
where, what should I do, where should
I invest, where should I not invest

244
00:14:25,371 --> 00:14:28,281
adoption basically how
do we adopt this one?

245
00:14:28,611 --> 00:14:29,186
So initially.

246
00:14:29,826 --> 00:14:32,076
We need to build some Ps, right?

247
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:35,316
Generally, whenever a new technology,
we need to build a P for that.

248
00:14:35,316 --> 00:14:38,706
What we need to do is we
need to upskill, we need to.

249
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:45,411
They'll definitely be a provider like
how we have now Azure, Amazon, Google.

250
00:14:45,711 --> 00:14:49,221
They'll be a provider, one of these
provider who will provide us the quantum

251
00:14:49,341 --> 00:14:50,721
infrastructure, quantum technology.

252
00:14:51,051 --> 00:14:52,371
We need to partner with them.

253
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:56,301
Then create a POCs to understand,
explore I what are the.

254
00:14:57,006 --> 00:14:59,076
How we can really start,
that's a foundation.

255
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:02,826
Then we need to build
a hybrid quantum class.

256
00:15:02,826 --> 00:15:06,126
Basically now we have our classical
infrastructure and then we have

257
00:15:06,126 --> 00:15:07,596
the, our quantum infrastructure.

258
00:15:08,016 --> 00:15:11,251
Now we need to build an integration
phase where you build any APIs.

259
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:16,001
Based on the quantum integrate
with the the classical APIs.

260
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:19,451
See how the, it's basically
like a B2B communication.

261
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:23,831
How to establish, basically understand
the PC, understand the limitations,

262
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:26,681
challenges that we may come overcome that.

263
00:15:26,771 --> 00:15:28,361
And so that is integration, right?

264
00:15:28,781 --> 00:15:30,521
First build something.

265
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:36,101
Based on quantum, then see the way
how we can integrate this quantum

266
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,821
based application within classical
infrastructure that we call the current

267
00:15:39,821 --> 00:15:43,901
classical is like a con or con with
this classical infrastructure to see

268
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:48,096
what are the challenges we have and
then once we, then we need to, with

269
00:15:48,096 --> 00:15:51,551
an automation, how we can make sure
this integration more seamlessly so

270
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,681
that we can know where to build what.

271
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:56,141
Which is the best
platform for us to build?

272
00:15:56,141 --> 00:16:01,281
What and how we can make it make
the benefit out of this integration.

273
00:16:01,781 --> 00:16:05,951
Find the workload distribution basically
between the classical and then and

274
00:16:05,951 --> 00:16:09,461
automate the quantum resource allocation
measure and improve the quantum things.

275
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:11,981
This is basically the
adoption you need to.

276
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:17,291
Adopt quantum to this classical, build
the application, integrate it, and then

277
00:16:17,381 --> 00:16:22,991
optimize and manage it within operation
so that our operations on this integration

278
00:16:22,991 --> 00:16:25,001
is more seamless and easy to manage.

279
00:16:25,501 --> 00:16:28,801
So as I studied, what some of the
case studies that are going on

280
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:33,121
or that will come in future is
basically one of them is a medical.

281
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:39,106
Where I can see that a lot of companies
will really put investment on this

282
00:16:39,106 --> 00:16:43,576
quantum so that they can make the
become medical study more faster.

283
00:16:43,756 --> 00:16:44,506
That is one thing.

284
00:16:45,496 --> 00:16:48,676
The other one where the investment
will go is all these cloud providers

285
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:54,196
will invest a lot on how do we
provision, make easy provisioning of

286
00:16:54,196 --> 00:16:56,476
this quantum infrastructure so that.

287
00:16:56,896 --> 00:17:00,616
They can get, they can invite
more customers to them so they

288
00:17:00,616 --> 00:17:01,936
can get the customer base.

289
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:04,096
So there be a lot of inform on that.

290
00:17:04,576 --> 00:17:09,846
The other one is the drug discord, which
I just talked, and the last one is how

291
00:17:09,846 --> 00:17:12,036
do we make more to the applications?

292
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:18,906
Any given application, how do I leverage
where I should put my in investment?

293
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:23,061
On which area of an application in a
classical infrastructure, and where

294
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:24,861
should I leave the benefit of quantum?

295
00:17:25,101 --> 00:17:26,931
It's not like everything
I built on quantum.

296
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:28,851
It may come with more cost.

297
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:33,371
So there should be a distinction
between within an application, which

298
00:17:33,371 --> 00:17:37,991
is my requirement, where I may need a
complex processing and where I don't

299
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:40,031
need a complex or that distinction.

300
00:17:40,031 --> 00:17:45,141
If you can make that level of design
level of distinction, if you make

301
00:17:45,141 --> 00:17:49,641
it, you can really benefit honest if
you are, if you don't put a little.

302
00:17:49,911 --> 00:17:52,011
Think through, you are
putting everything in quantum.

303
00:17:52,011 --> 00:17:53,391
You may have more investment.

304
00:17:53,691 --> 00:17:58,491
If you put more on the classical thinking
not required of quantum, then you may

305
00:17:58,491 --> 00:18:00,351
not take the benefit of complex process.

306
00:18:00,471 --> 00:18:05,421
So what Most of the applications when
we know this new start, when the quantum

307
00:18:05,421 --> 00:18:09,501
is already made, sure the more critical
part is how do we differentiate between

308
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:14,001
where we need to build and deploy
our applications easily, classical or

309
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:15,651
this, and how do we integrate this?

310
00:18:15,651 --> 00:18:18,051
This is another, a new set of design.
