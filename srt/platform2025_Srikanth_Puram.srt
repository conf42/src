1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,699
Good afternoon everyone.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,109
It's a real pleasure to be here
to share insights on platform

3
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:10,549
engineering for AI forward healthcare
native mobile architecture.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,510
For the last decade, healthcare
has shifted from being hospital

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,380
centered to being increasingly
mobile and patient center.

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,600
Mobile health devices are now essential
for remote monitoring, telemedicine,

7
00:00:23,645 --> 00:00:24,985
and personal health management.

8
00:00:25,485 --> 00:00:28,965
Along with the and with the YAY
integration, these platforms are

9
00:00:28,965 --> 00:00:35,205
becoming intelligent companions that
help doctors empower patients and make

10
00:00:35,705 --> 00:00:37,925
more, and make care more proactive.

11
00:00:38,224 --> 00:00:42,294
My name is Tri, and in this session
and in this session, I will, I'll walk

12
00:00:42,324 --> 00:00:46,644
through you how platform engineering
native, mobile architecture, and embedded

13
00:00:46,644 --> 00:00:52,425
AI combined to deliver scalable, secure,
transformative healthcare applications.

14
00:00:53,055 --> 00:00:58,289
For instance, during COVID-19 triage
apps help hospitals manage patients,

15
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:02,809
manage patient flow by flagging
urgent use cases remotely before

16
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:05,570
patients even arrive 80 years.

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,809
The mo, the movement showed how
digital platforms can save, can

18
00:01:10,809 --> 00:01:14,799
directly save lives when internet
for scale and intelligence.

19
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:16,739
Let's go to the agenda.

20
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:21,449
So in this in this agenda we'll
be covering about we'll be

21
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:22,799
having a brief introduction.

22
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:26,884
In this introduction we'll cover
about the convergence of platform

23
00:01:26,884 --> 00:01:28,774
engineering and healthcare technology.

24
00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:33,664
The second slide will be covering about
native mobile architecture, the foundation

25
00:01:33,664 --> 00:01:35,374
of healthcare platform engineering.

26
00:01:35,914 --> 00:01:41,014
Embedded AI integration, transforming
AI health, healthcare delivery

27
00:01:41,014 --> 00:01:44,794
through intelligent platforms,
HIPA complaints and security.

28
00:01:44,794 --> 00:01:49,984
Why architecture must embed
privacy and trust real time health

29
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,754
monitoring is one more aspect.

30
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,494
Engineering platforms for country.

31
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:55,854
For continuous care.

32
00:01:56,244 --> 00:01:59,794
And the other aspect is clinical
decision support, enhanced

33
00:02:00,364 --> 00:02:01,954
care, quality and outcomes.

34
00:02:02,464 --> 00:02:04,714
And the last point is
the future directions.

35
00:02:04,804 --> 00:02:09,214
Emerging technologies drive
healthcare's Next evolution.

36
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:13,974
Along the way we will also highlight
areas like patient engagement,

37
00:02:13,974 --> 00:02:15,879
scalability, and strategy will benefit.

38
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:20,249
So in the, in this slide, we'll be
talking about the convergence of platform

39
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:25,169
engineering and healthcare technology,
healthcare systems healthcare systems

40
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:30,009
worldwide face major challenges like
aging population, rising chronic diseases,

41
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:32,584
illness, and worst stage capacit.

42
00:02:33,204 --> 00:02:36,804
Traditional models of care can't
keep up with these demands.

43
00:02:37,254 --> 00:02:40,244
This is where platform engineering
plays a pre pivotal role.

44
00:02:40,724 --> 00:02:45,104
Instead of building isolated apps,
we design platforms reusable,

45
00:02:45,104 --> 00:02:49,874
scalable, and secure foundation that
can serve multiple healthcare needs.

46
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:54,494
This shift means developing
reusable components instead

47
00:02:54,494 --> 00:02:55,664
of reinventing the wheel.

48
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:01,529
And also using standard standardized
interfaces so hospitals, devices,

49
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:03,419
and insurance can connect seamlessly.

50
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:08,819
And the other aspect is building
scalable architectures that rely that

51
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,829
reliably handle millions of patients.

52
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:17,069
This mindset prioritizes reliability,
observability and maintainability, all

53
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:19,259
of each align perfectly with healthcare.

54
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,509
Healthcare's needs for consistent,
safe, and auditable systems.

55
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:30,419
So a UK hospital demo, a UK hospital
network demonstrated this when need

56
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:34,709
built a single shared platform for
appointments, telemedicines, and

57
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:37,454
vaccine, and vaccination track tracking.

58
00:03:37,954 --> 00:03:42,094
By using components across apps, they
cut development time significantly

59
00:03:42,994 --> 00:03:44,614
and improved system scalability.

60
00:03:45,114 --> 00:03:48,184
So in this slide, we'll be
talking about the native mobile

61
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:52,014
architecture, MO foundation for
healthcare platform engineering.

62
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:54,944
Why is native architecture
so critical in healthcare?

63
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:59,114
Because here, performance and
reliability can literally mean the

64
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,554
difference between life and day.

65
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:04,679
Native mobile health, native
mobile development enables

66
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:08,599
real time responsiveness for
for alerts and monitoring.

67
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:12,289
Latencies are unacceptable when
the patient's heart rate drops.

68
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:18,759
Enterprise grade security is also one
more aspect through enterprise grade

69
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:24,039
security enhances deeper o integration
with encryption and secure storage.

70
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:26,244
The other aspect is hardware integration.

71
00:04:26,904 --> 00:04:32,454
With glucose monitors, ECGs and blood
pressure cuffs, offline capabilities

72
00:04:32,454 --> 00:04:37,524
that allow critical features to
work in low network and rural areas.

73
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:42,444
This makes native architecture
the better for safe and

74
00:04:42,444 --> 00:04:44,154
dependable healthcare platforms.

75
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:49,114
For example, an Android based diabetes
care app connected directly with the

76
00:04:49,114 --> 00:04:51,874
Bluetooth enabled glucose monitors.

77
00:04:52,264 --> 00:04:55,294
Patients receive instant
alert for abnormal readings.

78
00:04:55,624 --> 00:05:00,864
While doctors get accurate and secure data
streams, that immediacy would not have

79
00:05:00,864 --> 00:05:02,814
been possible with a hybrid app approach.

80
00:05:03,314 --> 00:05:05,214
So in this slide, we'll be talking about.

81
00:05:05,714 --> 00:05:06,194
Embedded.

82
00:05:06,194 --> 00:05:06,524
Yay.

83
00:05:06,524 --> 00:05:09,434
Integration, transforming
healthcare delivery.

84
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:10,454
Yay, yay.

85
00:05:10,514 --> 00:05:15,284
Transform healthcare platforms
from reactive tools to be to prior

86
00:05:15,284 --> 00:05:20,424
to tools instead of taking the
addition instead of taking some

87
00:05:20,424 --> 00:05:23,124
actions after something has happened.

88
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:25,174
It's like a proactive thing.

89
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:29,014
We try to stop, we try to
predict the things and stop

90
00:05:29,014 --> 00:05:30,599
the things before happening.

91
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:36,119
So with frameworks like tensor Floor
Light, we can now run machine learning

92
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:40,559
models on mobile and mobile devices
themselves, keeping sensitive data

93
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:42,689
private, while enabling faster analysis.

94
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:48,629
Some of the most powerful capabilities
include predictive analytics to start to

95
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:53,629
spot early warning signs of healthcare
de deterioration, personalized care

96
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:57,709
recommendations, tune to each patient
data, clinical condition support.

97
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:03,379
Offering evidence-based suggestions for
doctors this shift, this shifts healthcare

98
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:08,269
from waiting for problems to arise
to anticipating them and intervening.

99
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:14,709
Early in India, a mobile iCare app
used embedded air to detect diabetic

100
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,399
pathy from smartphone images.

101
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:22,319
Rural clinics often lacking
eye specialists could suddenly

102
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,144
screen and refer patients early,
preventing available blindness.

103
00:06:26,644 --> 00:06:31,264
In this slide we'll be talking about
the HIPAA con HIPAA compliance.

104
00:06:31,764 --> 00:06:34,459
In this slide, we'll be talking
about HIPAA complaints and security.

105
00:06:35,184 --> 00:06:38,664
Architecture in EA powered
healthcare platforms in healthcare

106
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,074
compliance isn't optional.

107
00:06:40,224 --> 00:06:41,124
It's foundational.

108
00:06:41,874 --> 00:06:47,874
Every platform must guarantee data
encryption, both in rest and in transit.

109
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:52,094
Access control with role-based
permissions, biometrics, and multi

110
00:06:52,424 --> 00:06:57,794
multifactor authentication are they trace
that log every data interactions securely.

111
00:06:58,604 --> 00:07:02,259
Some YA models here are even
trained to operate on encrypt data.

112
00:07:03,014 --> 00:07:07,004
Through advanced methods further
enhancing privacy, the most effective

113
00:07:07,054 --> 00:07:10,984
platform, build these compliance
measures into the architecture itself.

114
00:07:11,404 --> 00:07:15,634
Ensuring every application develop
developed generates them automatically.

115
00:07:16,174 --> 00:07:21,174
We saw this with the US tele
telemedicine provider that restricted

116
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:26,754
test result access strictly to
physicians, not administrative staff.

117
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:32,679
This not only helped them meet HIPAA
standards, but also standardize, but also

118
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:34,299
increase patient trust in the platform.

119
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:38,949
The next slide we'll be talking about real
time health monitoring engineering plan.

120
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:43,349
Engineering platforms for
continuous use, healthcare is

121
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:45,329
no longer confined to hospitals.

122
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:50,119
Patients expect 24 7 monitoring where
they are when wherever they are.

123
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:55,519
Platforms must support sensor integration
with variables and implantables edge

124
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,799
computing to analyze signals locally
without waiting for the cloud.

125
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:04,719
Intelligent alerts that adapt to patient
baselines reducing false positive.

126
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:07,269
This approach enables continuous.

127
00:08:07,314 --> 00:08:11,714
Proactive care and ensure issues
are caught early for instance,

128
00:08:12,464 --> 00:08:17,114
cardiac patients in Japan used to
connect TCG patches that detected

129
00:08:17,114 --> 00:08:22,664
abnormal rhythms instantly, doctors
could intervene before emergencies

130
00:08:22,664 --> 00:08:27,134
escalated, reducing hospitalization,
and improving patient outcomes.

131
00:08:27,634 --> 00:08:30,604
The next slide talks about
the clinical vision support.

132
00:08:30,724 --> 00:08:31,024
Yay.

133
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:32,794
Enhanced care quality.

134
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:38,344
CL clinicians, clinic clinicians
faced overwhelming amounts of data.

135
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:43,264
AI helps by augmenting the decision
making, which supports evidence based.

136
00:08:43,264 --> 00:08:47,554
The recommendation aligned with
clinical guideline guiding guidelines.

137
00:08:47,554 --> 00:08:53,224
Risk str risk stratification to
identify high risk patients, medication

138
00:08:53,224 --> 00:08:58,884
management to detect drug interactions,
diagnostic assistance with analysis

139
00:08:58,884 --> 00:09:00,654
of labs, imaging and symptoms.

140
00:09:01,134 --> 00:09:07,444
Yeah, it doesn't replace doctors, but it
frees them to focus more on, on patients.

141
00:09:07,944 --> 00:09:11,564
For instance at Memorial
Sloan ing Oncology.

142
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:12,344
Yay.

143
00:09:12,444 --> 00:09:13,644
Yay based system.

144
00:09:13,644 --> 00:09:18,174
Suggested chemotherapy options based
on thousands of clinical guidelines.

145
00:09:18,564 --> 00:09:22,554
Doctors still made the addition
but the CO, but the AEA showed

146
00:09:22,554 --> 00:09:25,174
critical time and reduced error risk.

147
00:09:25,674 --> 00:09:27,719
Here in the next slide, we'll
be talking about the patient

148
00:09:27,849 --> 00:09:29,604
engagement and accessibility.

149
00:09:30,144 --> 00:09:33,264
A strong platform must
empower patient directly.

150
00:09:33,654 --> 00:09:38,184
This means inclusive design
with large fonts, wise input,

151
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,774
and high contrast moves.

152
00:09:40,194 --> 00:09:45,204
AI powered translation for multilingual
support, adaptive content tailored

153
00:09:45,684 --> 00:09:47,834
to patient literacy levels.

154
00:09:48,224 --> 00:09:52,574
When patients can understand and
manage their health outcomes improve.

155
00:09:53,054 --> 00:09:58,444
So like in Brazil, a multi-lingual
chatbot, Delaware medical advice.

156
00:09:58,894 --> 00:10:03,684
In Portuguese, Spanish, and
local ECTs by breaking language

157
00:10:03,684 --> 00:10:08,334
barriers it gave undeserved
communities better access to care.

158
00:10:08,814 --> 00:10:14,364
So even people who don't understand the
language, because of this multilingual

159
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:19,519
cha chat board, they can understand what
the gadget is telling them kind of stuff.

160
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,319
So in this slide we'll be talking
about the scalability and performance

161
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:25,769
engineering from healthcare integration.

162
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:29,999
As adoption growth, healthcare
platforms must remain reliable at scale.

163
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:30,824
This requires.

164
00:10:31,324 --> 00:10:35,839
MI Microservice architecture for
independent scaling cloud, cloud

165
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,959
native deployment for elastic capacity,
database optimization for fast,

166
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:46,699
massive data handling, robust APIs to
integrate diverse healthcare systems.

167
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:53,209
Performance monitoring to issues
proactively sca, scalability issues.

168
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:57,019
Platforms can serve populations,
not just individual clinics.

169
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:01,959
So for instance, during,
cOVID-19 vaccine dollars.

170
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:07,329
Scheduling platforms scaled overnight to
manage millions of appointments across

171
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:10,809
entire countries without any downtime.

172
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:14,654
In the next slide, we'll be talking
about implementation strategies from

173
00:11:14,654 --> 00:11:17,344
concept to clinical deployment building.

174
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,154
Building platforms is only
part of the challenge.

175
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:24,164
Deploying them safely into clinical
environments is equally critical.

176
00:11:24,614 --> 00:11:30,064
This means using agile methods, adapted
for regulatory cycles, conducting

177
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:34,864
clinical validation with diverse
patient populations, running pilot

178
00:11:34,864 --> 00:11:40,084
programs to test safely in controlled
settings, supporting change management

179
00:11:40,084 --> 00:11:41,914
through staff training and gradual.

180
00:11:42,814 --> 00:11:47,164
Success depends not just on
technology, but also on the adoption.

181
00:11:47,284 --> 00:11:48,334
Adoption and trust.

182
00:11:49,234 --> 00:11:53,074
A US Children's Hospital
piloted its asthma management

183
00:11:53,074 --> 00:11:55,684
app with just 50 families.

184
00:11:55,834 --> 00:12:01,314
After refining the experience, they
safely expanded it to 10,000 patients.

185
00:12:01,814 --> 00:12:03,649
That's a great big breakthrough.

186
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:07,209
So in this slide we'll be talking
about the future directions

187
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:10,654
of emerging technologies and
healthcare platform evolution.

188
00:12:11,154 --> 00:12:11,394
Evolution.

189
00:12:11,904 --> 00:12:15,924
The future of healthcare platforms
is being shaped by emerging

190
00:12:15,924 --> 00:12:20,664
technologies like a JA computing
to run advanced models locally.

191
00:12:21,414 --> 00:12:22,884
Federal learning pertain.

192
00:12:23,384 --> 00:12:27,554
Federated learning, retain models
collaboratively without sharing raw data,

193
00:12:28,244 --> 00:12:33,704
augmented reality to support doctors
during surgery or patient care wise.

194
00:12:33,704 --> 00:12:36,644
First, attendance for natural
hands-free interaction.

195
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:41,134
These advances will make more
intelligent, accessible, and personal.

196
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:46,419
For example, surgeons in
Toronto use the air headsets to

197
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:48,519
overlay imaging on live anatomy.

198
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,239
Reducing surgery times
and improved accuracy.

199
00:12:51,739 --> 00:12:56,209
Here we talk about the strategic benefits
of AI powered healthcare platforms.

200
00:12:56,719 --> 00:13:00,169
AI powered platforms create
values across the healthcare

201
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:02,989
system like clinical efficiency.

202
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,614
By automating this task patient
engagement through personalized insights.

203
00:13:08,444 --> 00:13:13,244
Care coordination by connecting providers
preventive care, using predictive

204
00:13:13,244 --> 00:13:18,524
analysis, resource optimization for
staff and supply chains, regulatory

205
00:13:18,524 --> 00:13:21,604
compliance via automated reporting.

206
00:13:22,444 --> 00:13:27,124
The impact extends beyond patients to
the entire healthcare system in Germany,

207
00:13:27,124 --> 00:13:33,844
and AI scheduling system optimized nurse
shifts reducing overtime by 20% while

208
00:13:33,844 --> 00:13:35,584
maintaining the quality of healthcare.

209
00:13:36,084 --> 00:13:37,404
So this is a conclusion.

210
00:13:37,434 --> 00:13:43,734
The strategic Im imperative of this one
is to wrap up platform engineering use of

211
00:13:43,764 --> 00:13:48,574
the foundation for healthcare, use of the
foundation healthcare system requires,

212
00:13:48,934 --> 00:13:52,864
and also native mobile development
provides respon, responsiveness,

213
00:13:52,864 --> 00:13:54,544
security, and device integration.

214
00:13:55,369 --> 00:14:00,099
And apart from that embedded AI transforms
platforms into intelligent companies.

215
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:05,469
Together these approaches make healthcare
safer, smarter, and more scalable.

216
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:10,019
Singapore has already shown this
with the national AI powered

217
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:15,174
health apps, which unify patients
records, monitoring and services.

218
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:18,774
This demonstrates how
platform engineering can be.

219
00:14:18,849 --> 00:14:24,519
It can be a true strategic imperative,
not just a technical choice.

220
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:27,119
Thank you all for your time and attention.

221
00:14:27,689 --> 00:14:31,199
The convergence of platform
engineering, native mobile design

222
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,359
and AI is not just about apps.

223
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:36,239
It's about team engineer
healthcare itself.

224
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:40,354
I hope this session gives gives
you a clear perspective on now.

225
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:45,729
The foundation's enable platform that
truly make a difference in people's lives.

226
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:52,259
I would like to take your, I would like to
thank you all for giving me an opportunity

227
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:54,569
to provide, to present this topic.

228
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:55,919
Thank you.

229
00:14:56,684 --> 00:14:57,374
Have a good day.
