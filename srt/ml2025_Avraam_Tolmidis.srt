1
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,390
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,650
I will be talking to you about AI in
the fast lane, how we can use smart

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,990
traffic systems to unclog our cities.

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:20,850
This way we can use intelligent technology
to revolutionize urban transport.

5
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,830
First couple of things about me.

6
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,240
My name is Ara Del.

7
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,100
I have been working as an engineering
manager for the last seven years.

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,980
I have worked in various technical
roles for the last 13 years in the

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,769
automotive, FinTech and tech industries.

10
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:49,890
I have worked four years in automated
driving and I have an electrical computer

11
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:56,470
engineering degree a PhD in the field with
focus on multi objective optimization.

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,710
And I have a degree in education.

13
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:05,530
Throughout my career, I have
been mentoring and trying to grow

14
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,570
professionally, computer engineers.

15
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:15,149
And fun fact, before switching to the
industry, I was working as a teacher.

16
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:17,459
I was teaching for seven years.

17
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:21,190
But let's yeah, let's look into.

18
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,320
More detail and what we
will be discussing today.

19
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,510
First, I will touch a bit on
what the current challenges are

20
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,190
in traffic management systems.

21
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:40,590
Then I will discuss a bit how we can use
software agents and smart traffic systems.

22
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,730
Then I will touch briefly on
what the required infrastructure

23
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,250
would be to be able to implement.

24
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:48,595
So it's a system.

25
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:55,875
And finally, I will present what
the benefits can be of using

26
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,335
ai driven traffic management.

27
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:00,295
Let's get started then.

28
00:02:00,865 --> 00:02:03,655
So what are the challenges?

29
00:02:03,655 --> 00:02:08,845
I'm sure everyone has faced, if
not all of them, most of them,

30
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:10,810
and everyone is familiar with 'em.

31
00:02:11,605 --> 00:02:15,515
First we do have an
increase in congestion.

32
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:18,564
Yeah, congestion is rising in urban areas.

33
00:02:19,094 --> 00:02:25,084
We have cities being overpopulated,
population is growing, and this also

34
00:02:25,084 --> 00:02:29,674
leads to the increase in vehicle
usages, and this leads to longer

35
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:36,394
commute times and congestion,
the infrastructure in our cities.

36
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:38,855
It is often inadequate.

37
00:02:39,844 --> 00:02:44,614
This can happen either because it's
outdated and it hasn't been maintained

38
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:52,854
for some time, or because it was not
built to withstand all the pressure it

39
00:02:52,854 --> 00:03:00,474
feels now with all the vehicles and all
the road users that increase in number.

40
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:06,729
I already mentioned that we have
a growing number of vehicles.

41
00:03:06,779 --> 00:03:11,099
This doesn't happen with the
same rate in every country in the

42
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,779
world, or every city in the world.

43
00:03:13,179 --> 00:03:18,849
But the trend is still increasing
and this poses significant challenges

44
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:21,279
to the traffic management systems.

45
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:28,044
This all this also generates the other
problem when we have traffic events.

46
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,499
Usually our reaction is delayed.

47
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:32,999
Our systems are too slow.

48
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:37,109
Usually some human needs to
detect something and some

49
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:41,129
human needs to intervene, and
that can take a lot of time.

50
00:03:42,029 --> 00:03:50,099
So the result is lost time, lost
fuel, or other type of cost, and

51
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:52,229
most importantly, lost lives.

52
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:55,919
But what if.

53
00:03:58,184 --> 00:04:01,754
We didn't have to have such
a traffic management system.

54
00:04:02,174 --> 00:04:07,454
What if every car and traffic
light was an intelligent agent?

55
00:04:08,264 --> 00:04:15,074
What if they could negotiate, adapt, and
optimize their behavior in real time?

56
00:04:15,944 --> 00:04:20,114
That is the idea behind the
decentralized traffic intelligence.

57
00:04:21,764 --> 00:04:24,794
Let's, I'll look into
it a little bit more.

58
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:27,359
How would we use software agents?

59
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,769
In a smart traffic system?

60
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:35,879
There would be mobile agents that
would correspond to the vehicles,

61
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:39,659
and then in the intersections
we would have stationary agents.

62
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:44,789
Each of them makes decisions
based on local context mostly.

63
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:52,439
However, if we feel that there's
a need for that, we can use

64
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:53,519
more centralized optimizations.

65
00:04:54,884 --> 00:05:00,224
And more centralized policies so
that we can try to optimize for the

66
00:05:00,224 --> 00:05:02,895
broader urban area not just locally.

67
00:05:03,895 --> 00:05:09,895
And this is the, a more system
which stands for adaptive multi

68
00:05:09,895 --> 00:05:15,835
objective, optimized routing agents,
optimize for time, distance, cost

69
00:05:15,954 --> 00:05:20,574
emissions, or any other objective
that one might thing makes sense.

70
00:05:22,374 --> 00:05:29,794
The agents bid for road segments based
on current values of these objectives.

71
00:05:30,544 --> 00:05:33,744
And the routes evolve continuously
as the traffic changes.

72
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:39,539
So in more detail, a vehicle approaches
a decision point, like an intersection.

73
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,934
It requests a potential next step
from the nearby stationary agents.

74
00:05:45,684 --> 00:05:46,644
Each stationary agent.

75
00:05:47,499 --> 00:05:53,409
Calculates a bit a cost estimate for
using the road segments over route.

76
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:59,439
It proposes for the vehicle to
take based on the current data.

77
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:05,739
Then the vehicle evaluates all bids using
its weighted objective function and its

78
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:11,709
selects the lowest cost next step, which
is the best trade off among the priorities

79
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:13,899
we have selected to optimize by.

80
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:19,899
How is the bid negotiation happening?

81
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:24,189
So the vehicle agent sends the route
request to the nearby stationary

82
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:30,759
agents, plus the wage for each objective
to optimize the stationary agent.

83
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:34,479
Then accesses segment
data for each objective.

84
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:42,039
And depending on the data freshness
or staleness, it may calculate

85
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:43,479
or update expected values.

86
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:49,269
For the segments of the potential
routes for the different objectives

87
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:56,349
that we want to optimize by then the
stationary agent will normalize the

88
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,059
values for each of these segments.

89
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:03,309
It'll calculate the cost per segment
using the weighted objective function,

90
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:08,769
which in the case of three objectives that
are time, distance, and monetary cost.

91
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,789
The cost of the segment
would be the weight.

92
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:18,429
All the time, multiplied by the normalized
time, the weight of the distance

93
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:23,769
multiplied by the normalized distance
and the weight of the cost multiplied

94
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:25,809
by the normalized monetary cost.

95
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:30,939
So the stationary agent will
calculate the possible routes

96
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:32,649
and that the pico can take.

97
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:40,569
As mentioned, the cost of each route would
be the sum of the cost of each segments.

98
00:07:41,574 --> 00:07:48,174
The stationary agent bid will be
the cost of the lowest route cost,

99
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:54,144
and this will be the route that it
would be recommending to the vehicle.

100
00:07:54,744 --> 00:07:59,604
So the vehicle selects and follows the
initial segments of the lowest bid route.

101
00:08:02,304 --> 00:08:08,335
Then the process continues with
re-planning as the vehicle moves.

102
00:08:08,724 --> 00:08:11,724
The vehicle reevaluates the
options, every few steps.

103
00:08:12,594 --> 00:08:16,254
Why this happens because
conditions can change.

104
00:08:16,965 --> 00:08:21,195
Like we can have congestion
present that wasn't there before.

105
00:08:21,374 --> 00:08:27,285
We can have an accident or some other type
of emergency can occur, so the stationary

106
00:08:27,315 --> 00:08:33,855
agents at the next step or some steps
forward could potentially suggest better

107
00:08:33,855 --> 00:08:36,405
alternatives based on the new conditions.

108
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:42,329
And this allows for real time
rerouting and self adaptation.

109
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:50,450
Let's see how the big generation
process would work for yeah,

110
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,780
three objectives monitored.

111
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:59,870
So we would require a route, we would
query the database for the network segment

112
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,545
data, we would get the segments for.

113
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,580
For the different routes
that we could take.

114
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,410
We would estimate the expected
traffic vehicle speed for these

115
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,910
segments of the road network.

116
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,840
And then we would be creating our
network graph using the distance,

117
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,950
time, and cost in this case where
we have these three objectives.

118
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,240
Yeah.

119
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,720
And the waves would be according
to the profile provided.

120
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:33,635
We can use some algorithm to figure
out which one of the potential

121
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:35,765
routes would be the optimal.

122
00:09:36,065 --> 00:09:42,045
It would be Dextra or it could be some
other more sophisticated potentially.

123
00:09:43,335 --> 00:09:48,195
And then we would see if a
route exists, then we would.

124
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,200
Calculate the bid and
send it to the vehicle.

125
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:59,170
If it doesn't exist, then we would
send some negative value and then the

126
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:05,270
vehicle would select the lowest positive
value that we could get as a bid.

127
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,620
And let's see what happens next.

128
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,790
So we said a route exists.

129
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,270
If it doesn't exist, we cannot
go to the place we wanted.

130
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,640
So there's nothing to do.

131
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:27,810
If route does exist, then we receive
a list of the next nodes that we

132
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:34,230
need to go through and then we
start our journey and we see is the

133
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,800
next road congested or is the list.

134
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:41,145
All the next nodes
complete after this one.

135
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:47,515
If not, then we move to the next
node and then we check if the next

136
00:10:47,515 --> 00:10:50,755
node is our target node or not.

137
00:10:50,995 --> 00:10:55,765
If it is a target node or it's our
destination, yay, everyone is happy.

138
00:10:56,665 --> 00:11:02,635
If not, then we move to the next node
after that, and then we check again.

139
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:05,815
Is our node list complete?

140
00:11:06,385 --> 00:11:11,515
Have we been through all of them,
or is there some type of emergency

141
00:11:11,515 --> 00:11:14,155
or congestion in the next node?

142
00:11:15,235 --> 00:11:19,855
If there is some emergency or
congestion or the list is not complete,

143
00:11:20,575 --> 00:11:26,275
we initiate an auction again, and
then the process continues until

144
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,315
we finally reach our destination.

145
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,620
Here's a conceptual diagram
of how this would work.

146
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,610
You can see vehicle agents, you
can see different type of mobile

147
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:42,050
agents like the vehicles, emergency
vehicles, public transport, and so on.

148
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,600
And you also see the stationary agents.

149
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:52,730
We do collect real time traffic
data, and it can be that stationary

150
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,770
agents can also exchange data.

151
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:59,900
In case it will improve their
estimations for the values that they will

152
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,100
provide for the different objectives.

153
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,070
So what I did was tried to run
some simulations to see how

154
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,960
effective such a system would be.

155
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:18,480
So I used the net logo simulation
environment and I run lots of simulations.

156
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,030
A few hundreds with different
scenarios that included cases where

157
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:28,970
there was congestion, emergencies,
different type of vehicles and so on.

158
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,690
And this happened for some fixed distance.

159
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,590
And this is the results I got.

160
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,085
So for the same distance,
I compared three different.

161
00:12:46,655 --> 00:12:47,315
Approaches.

162
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:52,395
One is this normal routing distance base.

163
00:12:52,395 --> 00:12:55,975
You try to find the route with
a minimum distance and then

164
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:59,815
you execute that same thing.

165
00:13:00,385 --> 00:13:05,395
You try to execute the route, you find
this time using multi objective routing so

166
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:07,915
you can optimize for different objectives.

167
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:13,895
But once you, decide on some route
initially, then you execute it to the end.

168
00:13:14,435 --> 00:13:19,715
And then the third approach is the
amor approach where you do optimize

169
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:26,585
for different objectives, but you do
dynamic re-planning every sum nodes

170
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:31,415
or as discussed when there is some
type of change, like an emergency or

171
00:13:31,415 --> 00:13:33,065
congestion that wasn't present before.

172
00:13:34,475 --> 00:13:36,485
What we see is that.

173
00:13:37,415 --> 00:13:45,225
The cost, monetary cost, when you have the
multi objective approaches, the dynamic

174
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:50,335
and non-dynamic re-planning is more
or less the same, but it is lower than

175
00:13:50,815 --> 00:13:53,515
planning route based on distance only.

176
00:13:55,155 --> 00:14:03,035
And then we have a shorter travel time,
using multi objective optimization than we

177
00:14:03,035 --> 00:14:06,035
would have optimizing based on distance.

178
00:14:06,635 --> 00:14:12,425
And we have even shorter duration
of the travel when we do the dynamic

179
00:14:12,425 --> 00:14:14,765
re-planning with the amor system.

180
00:14:16,685 --> 00:14:21,545
And we can finally see that there's
really a huge difference in how much.

181
00:14:22,385 --> 00:14:27,695
Our trip duration would increase if we
suddenly get consistent in the traffic.

182
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:32,915
So there is some slight difference
between the distance based approach

183
00:14:32,945 --> 00:14:38,805
and the multi objective approach, but a
more with dynamic or planning is really

184
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:46,005
shining there with less than 20% of the
increase compared to the other methods.

185
00:14:47,005 --> 00:14:48,115
And that's all very nice.

186
00:14:48,115 --> 00:14:52,075
What would we need to actually
realize this in our roads?

187
00:14:54,385 --> 00:14:58,105
First, we would need V two
Xen enabled infrastructure.

188
00:14:58,405 --> 00:15:03,865
For those that are not familiar with
V two X, it means vehicle to anything

189
00:15:04,255 --> 00:15:10,065
and it allows vehicles to communicate
with each other with different traffic

190
00:15:10,115 --> 00:15:12,545
elements like smart traffic lights.

191
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:16,245
Or smart traffic signs, which
can adapt what they display.

192
00:15:17,745 --> 00:15:22,625
And even with mobile phones potentially
so the vehicle could communicate

193
00:15:22,745 --> 00:15:27,965
with the pedestrian that comes behind
the building in the next block.

194
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:33,445
So you could really see and understand
how the environment around you is.

195
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,830
Besides the smart traffic lights and
the adaptive road signs, we would

196
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:43,880
also have the roadside units, which
would be the stationary agents.

197
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,150
So from the vehicle side.

198
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,010
Vehicles would obviously need to
be V two X capable and the vehicles

199
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,040
would be running the actual app.

200
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:01,490
The agents that they would use
in order to to their smart road

201
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,840
planning and communicate with
the rest of the infrastructure.

202
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:13,360
On the cloud and edge layer level
we would need local road terminals.

203
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:20,740
This would enable a fast computation
and assuming we want to have some

204
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:27,385
centralized overview of the traffic
and potentially use this to do a more

205
00:16:27,385 --> 00:16:30,715
centralized planning, we would need
a city traffic management center.

206
00:16:33,055 --> 00:16:35,185
What assumptions are we making?

207
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:41,005
So we're making the assumption that
the map of the environment is known.

208
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:49,525
So the vehicles do not do continuous,
an online localization and mapping.

209
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:52,385
They know the map of
their environment already.

210
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:56,375
The road segments may have
tolls or different charges.

211
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:04,040
We do have available historical traffic
data and we continuously collect as the

212
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:09,320
system is online, additional ones and
the vehicles know their global position.

213
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:12,800
Okay.

214
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,940
We talked about everything,
but what's the benefit?

215
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,130
What would we gain out of this?

216
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:24,110
We have seen a few things based on
the simulation results, and this

217
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:28,950
allows us to to estimate that this
would make it easier to optimize

218
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,500
traffic flow B two X enabled traffic.

219
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,980
Signs and lights also play a role
in this because you can change

220
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,190
the signal timings based on the
traffic and reduce the delays.

221
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:48,480
AI driven systems that analyze in
real time the traffic data play an

222
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,250
important role in enabling this.

223
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,090
This would also help
us reduce bottlenecks.

224
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:59,750
Both because we would try to optimize
traffic flow, but we would also

225
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:05,360
potentially redirect traffic and
through different routes that would

226
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,810
enable them to have a smoother
journey and less congestion.

227
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:17,620
And all of this would lead to sort
travel times which in our current urban,

228
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,460
our current environment in our urban
cities would make a big difference

229
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:25,120
for a lot of people that have to
travel for a significant amount of

230
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:31,200
time, spend some time on the road they
could spin it in something potentially

231
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,090
much more pleasant and productive.

232
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:41,920
Besides this, using the ai driven
traffic management system, we could

233
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:46,870
have improvements with respect to road
safety or how we prioritize our traffic.

234
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:53,260
For example, when we have real
time yeah, road closers something

235
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,570
happens, we can rear out our traffic.

236
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,080
Smart systems will enable us.

237
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:04,650
To do this in a faster way and
this will optimize traffic flow.

238
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:09,900
And this would also help reduce potential
accidents when there is a road blockage.

239
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:17,030
We could also manage traffic in a
priority based way so we can dynamically

240
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:23,300
prioritize different actors and like
public transferred or emergency services.

241
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,340
And in the case of an emergency,
we could even help ambulances

242
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,650
negotiate some green wave access.

243
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:36,850
So they get they get priority and they
can go fast where they need to be.

244
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:45,110
And finally, there are also environmental
benefits and reduced emissions.

245
00:19:46,475 --> 00:19:48,275
We have a smoother traffic flow.

246
00:19:48,435 --> 00:19:55,435
This leads to reduced congestion but also
we don't have this stop and go traffic

247
00:19:55,435 --> 00:19:58,165
all the time as the traffic is smoother.

248
00:19:58,535 --> 00:20:04,050
And this enables vehicles
to consume less energy.

249
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,100
Emit less CO2.

250
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,910
And this also improves the
air quality in our cities.

251
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,960
Thank you very much.

252
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:19,120
Please share also your thoughts,
your views, or how you envision

253
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,820
traffic management in the future.

254
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,210
Thank you.
