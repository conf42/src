00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,870
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:06,360
Welcome to my presentation on
Revolutionary go based security solutions

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,060
for complex enterprise environments.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,540
Today we'll discuss how we engineered a
high performance identity orchestration

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,460
framework to enhance security,
improve performance, and reduce costs.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:26,700
We will also learn on how Ghost
Concurrency model and memory management

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:33,239
enabled us to build a system that
deliver 300% faster policy resolution

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,610
in sub millisecond response time.

9
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:41,660
Join me as we discuss on a real world
case study and actionable strategies

10
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,360
you can implement in your organization.

11
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:50,230
Let's discuss some of the security
challenges in multi-cloud environments.

12
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,949
Modern enterprises operate across multiple
cloud providers and on-premise systems.

13
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:03,670
This creates security inconsistency in
security policies and identity management.

14
00:01:04,615 --> 00:01:08,845
Organizations struggle with
various authentication mechanism

15
00:01:09,085 --> 00:01:12,625
leading to performance bottlenecks,
and high resource overhead.

16
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:18,585
Traditional solutions often force
unacceptable trade-offs between security,

17
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:21,704
performance and operational efficiency.

18
00:01:22,695 --> 00:01:27,524
The statistics reveal a troubling
landscape where security team

19
00:01:27,524 --> 00:01:32,085
face challenges with compromising
performance or increasing costs.

20
00:01:32,585 --> 00:01:37,715
We will explore these key challenges
and their impact on security teams.

21
00:01:38,215 --> 00:01:42,145
Why use go for developing
security microservices?

22
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:47,145
Go is an ideal choice for security
applications due to its high

23
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:52,300
performance, lightweight concurrency
model and built-in security features.

24
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,810
Its compilation to native machine
code eliminates interpreter overhead

25
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,000
while maintaining memory safety.

26
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,750
The language's simplicity reduces
the potential for security bugs that

27
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,449
often plague more complex languages.

28
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:14,440
For DevOps Team Go provides
consistent behavior across platforms

29
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,630
combined to create reliable
performant security services that

30
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,000
can scale with enterprises demands.

31
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,530
We look at why go outperforms traditional
languages in identity orchestration

32
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,730
at our identity
orchestration architecture.

33
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,270
Our system is structured into four
key components, request ingestion,

34
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,370
policy re resolution, token
management and access enforcement.

35
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,370
Each of these elements play a
crucial role in enforcing secure

36
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,590
efficient identity handling.

37
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:58,360
Our architecture implements a zero trust
security model where every request is

38
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,490
fully authenticated and authorized.

39
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,850
The system processes access request
through multiple microservices

40
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,220
while maintaining high performance.

41
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,030
By separating concerns into discrete
components, we have created a flexible

42
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,815
system that makes our architecture
scalable, adaptable to security

43
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:20,855
needs and resource efficient.

44
00:03:21,355 --> 00:03:24,685
Let's discuss on goals,
concurrency advantages.

45
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:30,565
Concurrency is a major advantage
of go the heart of our system's

46
00:03:30,565 --> 00:03:36,415
Performance advantage comes from go's,
lightweight go routines and channels.

47
00:03:37,405 --> 00:03:42,685
We have implemented sophisticated
concurrency pattern that enable our

48
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:47,725
authorization service to process
thousands of policy evaluations

49
00:03:47,905 --> 00:03:52,615
simultaneously without the overhead
of traditional threading models.

50
00:03:53,115 --> 00:03:58,155
Our custom scheduler manages go
routine life cycles to prevent

51
00:03:58,185 --> 00:04:03,255
resource leaks and ensure consistent
performance under wearing loads.

52
00:04:03,755 --> 00:04:08,315
We have also developed specialized
synchronization primitives that

53
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:12,755
minimize contention points and
eliminate common bottleneck in

54
00:04:12,755 --> 00:04:14,615
high throughput security systems.

55
00:04:15,115 --> 00:04:21,505
Why use identity query language for
implementation, we utilized identity

56
00:04:21,505 --> 00:04:27,535
query language, a domain specific language
that enables optimized query parsing,

57
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:30,775
policy matching, and decision evaluation.

58
00:04:31,765 --> 00:04:37,615
This allows for rapid paralyzed access
control decisions with minimal overhead.

59
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,420
The language allows security
engineers to define sophisticated

60
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,440
rule while maintaining sub
millisecond response times.

61
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,120
Let's look into integration
of this solution.

62
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,300
With cloud native technology, our
framework integrates seamlessly with

63
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:02,150
cloud native technologies like open
policy agent Kubernetes operators.

64
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:07,325
And service mesh solutions to
enhance security enforcement

65
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:09,095
in distributed environments.

66
00:05:10,085 --> 00:05:14,795
Our go microservice expose
Prometheus metrics endpoints

67
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:19,445
for comprehensive observability
and implement graceful shutdown

68
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:21,965
procedures to maintain reliability.

69
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:26,365
During updates, I will now
highlight few of the performance

70
00:05:26,365 --> 00:05:28,165
benchmarks that was groundbreaking.

71
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:35,035
Our goal-based solution achieves 300%
faster policy resolution compared

72
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:39,505
to traditional approaches, all
while reducing resource consumption.

73
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:44,715
These benchmarks highlight the real
world performance improvements achieved.

74
00:05:45,215 --> 00:05:49,625
These results were validated in
production environment, handling millions

75
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,700
of authentication requests each day.

76
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,539
Even under peak loads, our system maintain
consistent sub millisecond response

77
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:03,030
time while consuming significantly
fewer resources than comparable

78
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,609
solution implemented in other languages.

79
00:06:06,109 --> 00:06:08,690
Let's dive into a real world case study.

80
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,299
A global financial institution with
30 plus discrete cloud environment

81
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:19,969
was struggling with fragmented
identity controls access, their hybrid

82
00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:25,130
infrastructure leading to security
gaps and performance bottlenecks.

83
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:31,600
Our go based solution replaced a complex
web off legacy system with coherent

84
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,700
high performance security layer.

85
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:43,840
This solution was implemented and helped
to achieve 99.9997% availability, reducing

86
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:51,040
security incidents by 72%, and cutting
identity infrastructure cost by 65%.

87
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,409
The implementation took 12
weeks from design to production

88
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:00,784
deployment, demonstrating the
development possibilities with go.

89
00:07:01,284 --> 00:07:06,405
What were some of the implementation
best practices to consider Successful

90
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:11,655
implementation requires profiling, before
optimizing, designing for distributed

91
00:07:11,655 --> 00:07:14,565
workloads, and rigorous security testing.

92
00:07:15,065 --> 00:07:19,655
This separation enables independent
evolution of security rules

93
00:07:19,955 --> 00:07:23,495
without requiring redeployment
of enforcement points.

94
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:29,005
When designing your concurrency model
prefer channels for coordination

95
00:07:29,005 --> 00:07:33,355
between go routines rather than
traditional locking mechanisms.

96
00:07:33,855 --> 00:07:39,405
Using the context package consistently
throughout your application ensures

97
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:44,385
proper cancellation, propagation, and
prevents resource leaks under error

98
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:46,305
condition, or shutdown scenarios.

99
00:07:46,805 --> 00:07:51,785
Following these best practices
ensures a robust and scalable system.

100
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:56,305
Finally, let's dive into the
key takeaways and next steps.

101
00:07:57,055 --> 00:08:01,165
Go is a powerful choice
for security microservices.

102
00:08:01,705 --> 00:08:05,484
Its concurrency model enables
high performance policy

103
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:10,884
evaluation and its cloud native
integration simplifies deployment.

104
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,550
Our open source framework is
available for implementation.

105
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:20,739
We invite you to explore our open
source implementation and documentation.

106
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:26,219
The team is available for technical
discussion about how these patterns can

107
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:28,920
be applied to your specific environment.

108
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:34,740
Connect with us after the presentation
to discuss your security challenges and

109
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,200
how our goal-based approach might help.

110
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,590
Finally, thank you for your time.

111
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,760
I'm happy to take questions and
discuss further on how this solution

112
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,310
can be applied to your organization.
