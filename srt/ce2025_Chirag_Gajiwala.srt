00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,030
Thank you for attending this session
and, let me first give you a quick

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,510
introduction about myself and what I do.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:12,220
so I work at a tech company in
Seattle, and I have more than

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,710
eight years of experience in, data
engineering, analytics, machine

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,660
learning, and cybersecurity.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,950
I graduated from Northeastern University
in, and I have been working in this

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:31,910
field and I, apart from work, I like to
travel, I like to also try to learn new AI

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,345
models and try to fine tune those models.

9
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:40,095
So today we are going to cover
presentation on AI frontiers, deep

10
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:42,015
learnings, transformative impact.

11
00:00:42,115 --> 00:00:46,985
We have seen a lot of deep learnings
advancements in reshaping industries

12
00:00:46,995 --> 00:00:53,575
using reinforcement learning, generative
models, and these are being used in almost

13
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:56,335
all the sectors, including cybersecurity.

14
00:00:56,965 --> 00:00:59,325
So let's dive deep into it.

15
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,630
so this slide provides you
about reinforcement learning.

16
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:07,710
So what do you mean by
reinforcement learning?

17
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,630
So reinforcement is something
you try to reinforce something

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,020
and try to make it more powerful.

19
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,900
So that's exactly the concept
of reinforcement learning.

20
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:23,760
So it is like a reward based
learning and it helps the AI based

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,920
system to overcome the errors by
using trial and error technique.

22
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:34,030
And most of the algorithms in this
space use pattern recognition and

23
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:40,540
using deep learning and strategic
decision making and neural networks

24
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,350
and all these kinds of models.

25
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:47,100
So they are based on reinforcement
layer based learning, where you

26
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,460
provide the rewards and then
using trial and error method.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,890
It tries to generate a pattern and
improves the model as compared to the

28
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,010
supervised and unsupervised models.

29
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,750
And reinforcement learning is very
powerful and every year we are

30
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,160
seeing a lot of new advancements
using reinforcement learning.

31
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:11,275
Next slide over here is very important.

32
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:13,895
It goes through the
transformer based model.

33
00:02:14,315 --> 00:02:20,185
So transformer based model, why it is
so powerful and why it is being used.

34
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:24,065
So let's dive deep into
a transformer model.

35
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:29,010
So transformer model is basically
a neural which kind of learns the

36
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:35,320
context, by tracking the relationships
in sequential data and words.

37
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:40,584
And it helps to overcome a lot of
challenges and solves a lot of problems.

38
00:02:40,585 --> 00:02:43,755
Problems, and it is a
very fast working model.

39
00:02:44,135 --> 00:02:46,825
It can be used in time series analytics.

40
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:49,545
It can be used in recognition.

41
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:55,295
It can also be used in kind of image
and image detection, as well as words,

42
00:02:55,335 --> 00:03:00,695
predicting the words and translating a
sentence and a lot of other use cases.

43
00:03:00,735 --> 00:03:06,165
There are, so in this slide,
let's go deep and understand the

44
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:08,145
architecture of a transformer.

45
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,540
transformer is basically
encoder and decoder algorithm.

46
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,640
And, how it works is, it has, it
has, these kind of attention function

47
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,900
where first it encodes the word.

48
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,525
Like for example, we look into a
particular example where we have to.

49
00:03:26,025 --> 00:03:28,745
Translate a sentence
into another language.

50
00:03:28,745 --> 00:03:34,085
So in this case, what will happen is we'll
provide the inputs in input embedding.

51
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:40,185
And from here in the encoder, it will
go into the multi head attention.

52
00:03:40,665 --> 00:03:46,135
So attention function, it is a very
important function over here, and it

53
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:51,795
tries to take all the components, let's
say in the sentence we have eight to

54
00:03:51,795 --> 00:03:56,915
10 words, so it will create these kind
of eight to 10 vectors and these kind

55
00:03:56,915 --> 00:04:01,585
of vectors they are quite, it will
optimize and make these vector and then

56
00:04:01,615 --> 00:04:07,575
it will go into this decoder function
where it has feed forward multi head

57
00:04:07,645 --> 00:04:14,235
attention, and it also has masks, multi
head attention, and it will then try to

58
00:04:14,315 --> 00:04:19,545
translate the word and then find out in
this use case, it will try to find out in

59
00:04:19,555 --> 00:04:21,765
the language which we want to translate.

60
00:04:21,765 --> 00:04:26,285
So it will try to generate the
words in that particular language.

61
00:04:26,785 --> 00:04:31,685
And then finally it'll, try to optimize
and, generate the output words.

62
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:36,155
So this kind of, algorithm, why
it is being used and very popular.

63
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:42,385
because this transformer based,
ai, model, this is very faster and

64
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,710
powerful and it works, parallelly.

65
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,750
So other models we have
seen, they do not work.

66
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:54,595
as parallel as this model and, transformer
based, machine learning models because

67
00:04:54,595 --> 00:05:00,185
they work way in parallel, it can
utilize the GPU like Nvidia's GPU and all

68
00:05:00,215 --> 00:05:02,795
kinds of GPUs in a very efficient way.

69
00:05:03,295 --> 00:05:10,765
So the GPU is utilized in an efficient way
and it can work very faster and it has the

70
00:05:10,765 --> 00:05:13,595
ability to scale up and work very fast.

71
00:05:13,615 --> 00:05:17,855
and the data sets which are being used
are scalable and quite scalable and

72
00:05:17,855 --> 00:05:19,935
you can get the output quite faster.

73
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,920
Then any other, AI algorithm, CNN, RNN,
or any other algorithm, which you can use.

74
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,880
So another use case over here
is it can predict the next word.

75
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,960
So based on the words you write, the
algorithm will be able to predict.

76
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,420
Or what would be the next word?

77
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,630
So it would be in the same situation.

78
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:44,880
It'll use the encoder and,
decoders attention function, and

79
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,885
it'll try to edit the next word.

80
00:05:47,065 --> 00:05:48,750
Now we come to time GPT.

81
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,070
So what is time?

82
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,520
GPT?

83
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,690
So time, GPT is, GPT based model.

84
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,780
It's a transformer based
time series analysis model,

85
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,045
which was developed by nla.

86
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,290
So this.

87
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,550
Small startup.

88
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,790
It has created a very good AI
model and it can be implemented

89
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,500
by a very small piece of code.

90
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:15,690
So it's a production ready generative
pre trained transformer for time series.

91
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,784
So this model can be utilized to you.

92
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:23,325
create time series analysis
and all kinds of things.

93
00:06:23,335 --> 00:06:28,105
So you can look into all the other
time series analysis and then try to

94
00:06:28,105 --> 00:06:32,955
use this model and it will provide you
with more accuracy and more accurate

95
00:06:33,045 --> 00:06:40,105
results and it is much faster scalable
and it can help you to optimize the

96
00:06:40,135 --> 00:06:44,885
time series and it just uses these
kind of small lines of code where you

97
00:06:44,885 --> 00:06:51,645
import the Nixla client, use the API
key over here, then you utilize in

98
00:06:51,655 --> 00:06:56,982
the Nixla client, you try to use that
and you load the data from, Python.

99
00:06:57,942 --> 00:07:04,242
Any large data from URL, or a
CSV, and then use that data frame

100
00:07:04,772 --> 00:07:10,462
and use the next Nixla client to
forecast and then use the forecast

101
00:07:10,482 --> 00:07:12,552
function to develop the time series.

102
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:15,802
So implementation is much
faster as compared to any

103
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,662
other time series analysis.

104
00:07:17,912 --> 00:07:25,532
And it is very efficient to use in detail
finance, IOT based applications in tech.

105
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:27,622
or cyber security as well.

106
00:07:28,122 --> 00:07:30,522
So now we come to another slide.

107
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,482
This slide provides us
with the information about

108
00:07:33,882 --> 00:07:35,862
convolutional neural network.

109
00:07:35,862 --> 00:07:38,332
What do you mean by
convolutional neural network?

110
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:43,332
So basically, this kind of neural
network very popular and it is

111
00:07:43,352 --> 00:07:48,192
being this kind of neural network is
being used for image related tasks.

112
00:07:48,232 --> 00:07:53,772
It can also be used for autonomous
driving where it can analyze and

113
00:07:53,782 --> 00:07:56,522
detect various obstacles on the road.

114
00:07:56,712 --> 00:08:01,222
It can find out if there are
any people around the road and

115
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:02,992
detect various things on the road.

116
00:08:03,272 --> 00:08:10,172
So basically it is optimized for image
related tasks and it can also be used for

117
00:08:10,212 --> 00:08:15,342
video games and such kind of applications
and this is, these are the key components

118
00:08:15,342 --> 00:08:18,122
of convolutional neural network.

119
00:08:18,202 --> 00:08:22,692
Is the convolutional network,
then the third one is the fully

120
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:24,092
connected, layer over here.

121
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:30,162
And, we have the activation function
where it improves and creates the output.

122
00:08:30,662 --> 00:08:35,657
So first we come to the pooling layer
where it Reduces the dimensionality

123
00:08:35,657 --> 00:08:40,347
of the feature by summarizing the
re regions and by using techniques

124
00:08:40,347 --> 00:08:45,927
like max pooling, and this helps us
to retain the important information

125
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:48,617
and also reduce the complexity.

126
00:08:48,617 --> 00:08:50,237
Then we have the.

127
00:08:51,092 --> 00:08:55,612
Pooling, the fully connected layer,
the fully connected layer is where

128
00:08:55,682 --> 00:09:01,812
the high level features within the
function are used for classification,

129
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,872
regression, and various other tasks.

130
00:09:03,872 --> 00:09:10,462
So in the fully connected layer, we use
high level features and it can be used to

131
00:09:10,522 --> 00:09:13,462
optimize and create more better outcomes.

132
00:09:13,462 --> 00:09:16,562
Then we have the activation function.

133
00:09:16,637 --> 00:09:21,497
There are a lot of activation functions
which are used to improvise and introduce

134
00:09:21,497 --> 00:09:26,597
some non linearity into the network
and then it also improves the neuron's

135
00:09:26,627 --> 00:09:28,747
capability and those kind of things.

136
00:09:28,757 --> 00:09:33,637
So convolutional neural network
is also quite extensively

137
00:09:33,637 --> 00:09:34,580
used, in, neural networks.

138
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:41,341
Many of the use cases like self
driving cars and image related tasks

139
00:09:41,471 --> 00:09:46,911
and for photography image and such
kind of optimizations convolutional

140
00:09:46,941 --> 00:09:48,481
neural network can be used.

141
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:53,351
We also have recurrent neural network
which is another kind of a neural

142
00:09:53,351 --> 00:09:57,171
network as compared to convolutional
neural network which I don't know.

143
00:09:57,801 --> 00:10:03,621
Is mostly used for applications related
to anomaly detection and more kinds of

144
00:10:03,651 --> 00:10:09,011
patterns kind of detection, and mostly
it is being used in cyber security.

145
00:10:09,971 --> 00:10:15,451
Okay, so now we come to this
slide over here, which provides us

146
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:20,821
information about GA and BAs, so
generative adversarial networks.

147
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:25,641
these are generative kind of,
Algorithms and VAs are variational

148
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:30,431
auto encoders and, they have different
use cases right now and they are

149
00:10:30,431 --> 00:10:33,301
very popular in anomaly detection.

150
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:36,841
So VAs are very important
in anomaly detection.

151
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:39,651
It can, anomalies, within cyber security.

152
00:10:39,651 --> 00:10:45,111
So the good use case of VA is are in
cyber security where it can, detect

153
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:50,111
various kinds of threats, improve
the accuracy of your model, existing

154
00:10:50,121 --> 00:10:52,701
model, and, analyze the patterns.

155
00:10:53,096 --> 00:10:57,466
in cybersecurity, but mostly you need
to first use your, current tools.

156
00:10:57,466 --> 00:11:01,546
You have SIM tools and various other
tools in cybersecurity, and then

157
00:11:01,576 --> 00:11:08,556
try to use VAs and you can also
use R Ns for finding the anomalies.

158
00:11:09,186 --> 00:11:14,346
Then we have photo realistic
images, so advanced styles for image

159
00:11:14,346 --> 00:11:19,766
generations and all kinds of things
is AI algorithms can be used for

160
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:22,466
photo generating photorealistic image.

161
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:23,966
Now we come to the next slide.

162
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:29,596
So this slide provides information
about the AI powered thread detection.

163
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:32,086
and using graph neural networks.

164
00:11:32,796 --> 00:11:35,826
So why do we need AI
based threat detection?

165
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:41,316
Because currently the threat detection
capabilities using cyber security tools

166
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:47,686
are a little bit limited and as more and
more threat actors are evolving, there

167
00:11:47,686 --> 00:11:52,616
is a constant scenario where they can
use AI based tools to plan an attack,

168
00:11:52,616 --> 00:11:54,996
DDoS attack and such kind of things.

169
00:11:55,046 --> 00:12:00,096
In this scenario, if we use AI based
threat detection, it can help us to

170
00:12:00,106 --> 00:12:04,986
mitigate such kind of threats and
provide us more patterns and with

171
00:12:05,086 --> 00:12:10,266
results with improved accuracy and
also reduce the false positives.

172
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,856
But in this case, we
have to train the model.

173
00:12:13,156 --> 00:12:18,796
In cybersecurity and compare the
results with the existing tools we

174
00:12:18,796 --> 00:12:24,326
have Splunk or Exabeam and such kind of
tools and try to find the threats and

175
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:29,186
compare the threats with the AI based
algorithm and then try to find out which

176
00:12:29,226 --> 00:12:31,466
would be the best algorithm to use.

177
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:37,811
Then we have graph neural networks,
which are, shaping and, detecting more

178
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:43,931
of security based monitoring, finding out
the patterns and improving the detection

179
00:12:43,951 --> 00:12:46,171
capabilities and conventional methods.

180
00:12:46,171 --> 00:12:51,761
So some of the important tools maybe
in next 5 to 10 years, we might see

181
00:12:51,811 --> 00:12:56,101
a lot of, use cases of these tools
and these tools being applied in

182
00:12:56,151 --> 00:13:00,171
security automation and improving
the threat detection capabilities.

183
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:04,831
So now the next slide provider
provides us with the AI

184
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:07,081
convergence and future direction.

185
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:13,121
So we have what were here, multi modal
AI, which is now seamlessly integrated

186
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:18,741
with multiple forms of input, vision,
speech, sensor data, creating more,

187
00:13:19,191 --> 00:13:24,861
Intuitive and comprehensive solutions,
which are similar to human understanding.

188
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:31,211
Then we have Age AI, which is more
of algorithms working directly on

189
00:13:31,221 --> 00:13:33,701
local devices rather than the cloud.

190
00:13:33,841 --> 00:13:39,441
And Age AI, because it is working
on local devices, it is very fast.

191
00:13:40,006 --> 00:13:47,096
And provides us with the good amount of,
privacy and more kind of faster response

192
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:52,486
and revolutionizing applications from
autonomous vehicles to healthcare devices.

193
00:13:53,026 --> 00:13:57,956
But the, but now when we apply such kinds
of things in our, use cases, we need to

194
00:13:57,956 --> 00:13:59,946
understand the ethical, considerations.

195
00:14:00,396 --> 00:14:04,516
You have to work with the compliance
team within the company to make sure

196
00:14:04,556 --> 00:14:07,006
that the AI models are working well.

197
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:13,686
They are not taking any customer data or
changing anything within your environment.

198
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:19,556
So be careful when using such kind of
AI models in cyber security or such

199
00:14:19,556 --> 00:14:25,246
kind of other use cases you have and
try to make sure that these kind of AI

200
00:14:25,246 --> 00:14:27,156
models are not having any impacts about.

201
00:14:27,406 --> 00:14:31,806
Privacy or, any changing any
data governance framework.

202
00:14:31,806 --> 00:14:38,526
So before deploying, so please try to
make sure the deployment of AI algorithms

203
00:14:38,526 --> 00:14:41,246
are done in a more ethical consideration.

204
00:14:41,746 --> 00:14:45,646
And now we come to AI's
transformative impact on industries.

205
00:14:46,156 --> 00:14:50,176
AI will have a lot of transformative
impact on the industries.

206
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:57,106
It will be having autonomous systems and
of self driving vehicles with 99 percent

207
00:14:57,106 --> 00:14:59,846
or maybe 95 or more percent accuracy.

208
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:04,325
Then it will be used in
drug discovery and it.

209
00:15:04,376 --> 00:15:08,516
will try to create, drugs at a
more cheaper price as compared

210
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:09,756
to currently what we have.

211
00:15:09,786 --> 00:15:15,016
And it will improve the pace in which
the drug discovery is being made.

212
00:15:15,146 --> 00:15:17,006
So there will be cost benefit.

213
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:20,046
There will be a lot of
mass production of drugs.

214
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:24,616
Then we have, Medicines like these
kind of AI tools will generate a lot

215
00:15:24,676 --> 00:15:30,826
of data points for the patients, then
take the inputs from the patients, from

216
00:15:30,826 --> 00:15:33,706
the doctors and plan the treatment.

217
00:15:33,706 --> 00:15:37,956
So AI based tools will provide
a lot of personalized medicines.

218
00:15:37,996 --> 00:15:41,696
It will help the medical sector
a lot along with pharmacy

219
00:15:41,696 --> 00:15:43,506
and autonomous systems.

220
00:15:43,636 --> 00:15:49,686
So all kinds of these kinds of
algorithms like CNN, RNN, transformer

221
00:15:49,686 --> 00:15:55,116
based models, they will help to
improve, various systems, along with

222
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:57,136
the drug discovery and medicines.

223
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:01,666
So next we come to, breakthroughs
and practical implications.

224
00:16:02,076 --> 00:16:04,546
So deep learning algorithms, have.

225
00:16:05,296 --> 00:16:09,526
evolved and they will try to evolve,
again and again, and they will

226
00:16:09,526 --> 00:16:11,306
evolve further in next five years.

227
00:16:11,316 --> 00:16:14,896
So right now we have
transformer based models.

228
00:16:14,946 --> 00:16:20,856
Maybe in next few years, we might see
more faster, models than this, and,

229
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:26,816
it will help us to create more, Better
outcomes and take, data from various

230
00:16:26,816 --> 00:16:32,436
diverse sources and try to create a
better kind of, outcomes with accuracy.

231
00:16:32,936 --> 00:16:35,446
now we have, the AI advancements.

232
00:16:36,126 --> 00:16:40,896
probably in financial intelligence,
then we have customer intelligence

233
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:43,376
and, various, various other places.

234
00:16:43,426 --> 00:16:50,076
I can help us to reduce the down times and
response times, and, it can also provide

235
00:16:50,106 --> 00:16:56,356
patterns, detecting patterns with accuracy
and enabling data driven strategies.

236
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:01,386
And, it will have also help us in
recommendation and such kind of things.

237
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:06,796
And we have to make sure that in all
of these things we do, we have to keep

238
00:17:06,796 --> 00:17:09,326
in mind the ethics and governance.

239
00:17:09,326 --> 00:17:15,376
We need to make sure that the governance,
data governance, and AI based ethical

240
00:17:15,796 --> 00:17:20,536
considerations are looked into so
that they don't exploit anything or,

241
00:17:21,046 --> 00:17:26,786
they change anything or put they can
take the customer data and utilize

242
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:29,476
it and, have, bigger kind of, issues.

243
00:17:29,486 --> 00:17:32,656
working with compliance team,
data governance, and ethics.

244
00:17:33,236 --> 00:17:36,016
ethical consideration also
needs to be looked into.

245
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:41,406
So when you look into, when you look
into such kind of things, AI models will

246
00:17:41,466 --> 00:17:44,276
improve the accuracy and they will evolve.

247
00:17:44,786 --> 00:17:50,902
And maybe by 2030, you might see better
outcomes using AI based algorithms,

248
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:54,776
using quantum AI and such kind of things.

249
00:17:55,276 --> 00:17:56,666
that's it from my, side.
