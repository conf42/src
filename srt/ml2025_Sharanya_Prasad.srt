00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,140
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,160
Welcome to the Con 42
Machine Learning Conference.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,520
I'm Shania Psar, a senior product
manager at Cisco Systems, and I'm really

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,200
excited to be here with all of you.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,000
Today.

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,100
I'll be talking about the convergence
of networking and security, a topic

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,310
that's more relevant than ever as
AI and ML continue to evolve, so

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,990
do the threats that they introduce.

9
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:33,795
Addressing these challenges requires a
unified approach, bringing networking

10
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:38,355
and security together to build resilient
and intelligent infrastructures.

11
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:43,605
In today's digital landscape,
networking and security can

12
00:00:43,605 --> 00:00:45,975
no longer be different silos.

13
00:00:47,144 --> 00:00:51,375
By converging these domains, we
create intelligent, automated, and

14
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,385
self defending infrastructures.

15
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,500
The integration is not only enhancing
protection against increasingly

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,360
sophisticated threats, but it's also
enabling enterprises to move faster,

17
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:09,150
innovate more efficiently, and respond
dynamically to changing business needs.

18
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,820
Ultimately, this convergence is key
to achieving resilient operations

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,750
and sustainable competitive advantage
in an ever evolving digital world.

20
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,940
So let's dive right into it

21
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,360
now.

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,520
Traditionally, networking and
security teams operate in isolation,

23
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,930
creating fragmented systems
that often left organizations

24
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,880
vulnerable and slow to respond.

25
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,300
Security policies were inconsistent.

26
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,560
Incidents took longer
to detect resolution.

27
00:01:45,135 --> 00:01:47,265
And this led to higher business risk.

28
00:01:48,015 --> 00:01:53,025
Today we are moving towards a converged
approach, uniting these two critical

29
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:58,875
functions into one cohesive framework
by integrating security directly

30
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,795
into your network infrastructure.

31
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:08,160
The organization is achieving unified
visibility, faster detection, automated

32
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,780
responses, and this is significantly
improving that ability and resilience

33
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,570
across these evolving threats.

34
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:22,040
Now, I wanted to give some,
examples of what kind of

35
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,140
business impacts are possible.

36
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:27,769
By integrating networking
and security together.

37
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:31,429
So for example, right?

38
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:39,139
You can see a reduction in your breach
related costs by an average of 15%, and

39
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:41,329
that directly reduces financial risk.

40
00:02:42,649 --> 00:02:49,459
Additionally, integrating these two
can accelerate threat containment.

41
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:53,389
It can also lead to.

42
00:02:54,394 --> 00:02:58,894
An improvement in managing security
incidents resulting in faster

43
00:02:58,894 --> 00:03:01,415
resolutions and streamlined operations.

44
00:03:03,185 --> 00:03:08,225
So it is definitely securing your
business and also empowering it.

45
00:03:08,945 --> 00:03:13,535
It's reducing your risk
and improving your agility.

46
00:03:14,535 --> 00:03:18,315
I wanna talk about a few key technologies.

47
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:21,919
We've seen evolve over the years.

48
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:26,809
Let's talk about four
key technologies here.

49
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:32,599
First, let's start with software defined
networking, where your dynamically routing

50
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:37,909
traffic based on realtime security needs,
ensuring performance and protection.

51
00:03:39,244 --> 00:03:43,354
Secure Access Service Edge,
SSE, which is my favorite topic.

52
00:03:43,654 --> 00:03:49,054
Unify secure security and networking
at the edge, enabling consistent policy

53
00:03:49,054 --> 00:03:51,124
enforcement wherever users connect.

54
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:57,184
Zero trust architecture enforces
identity verification for every single

55
00:03:57,184 --> 00:03:59,824
user and device, reducing lateral risk.

56
00:04:02,089 --> 00:04:07,699
And finally, AI powered security, which
brings intelligent threat detection to

57
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:13,099
the forefront using machine learning to
spot anomalies and automate responses.

58
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:16,370
This is enabling proactive
defense at scale.

59
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:23,750
Together, these pillars are
making convergence possible, and

60
00:04:23,809 --> 00:04:25,309
they're making it transformative.

61
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:28,499
Let's talk about the
market growth a little bit.

62
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:36,509
The SDN market is projected to grow from
10.5 billion in 2023 to 15.8 billion.

63
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:42,119
The SSE market is also exploding.

64
00:04:42,809 --> 00:04:47,969
It's almost tripling in size from about a
billion to 2.4 billion in just five years.

65
00:04:50,565 --> 00:04:56,085
Together these trends are fueling
demand for converge solutions, unlocking

66
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:59,925
massive new market opportunities
at the intersection of agility,

67
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,115
scalability, and cyber resilience.

68
00:05:03,115 --> 00:05:08,905
So what all have to be done as part
of this organizational transformation?

69
00:05:09,835 --> 00:05:15,114
So true convergence is not just about
technologies, as you might know, it

70
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,695
demands organizational transformation.

71
00:05:19,284 --> 00:05:23,244
It starts at the foundation with
consolidated infrastructure where

72
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:28,705
hardware and software are unified to
create a co cohesive digital environment.

73
00:05:29,515 --> 00:05:33,984
On top of that, you have integrated
tool sets that bridge networking

74
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:38,244
and security workflows and reduce
silos to enable efficiency.

75
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:44,140
Next you have collaborative teams
bringing together cross-functional

76
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,770
stakeholders with shared
accountability and success metrics.

77
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:53,830
And at the very top is where strategic
alignment ensures that business and

78
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,510
security goals are synchronized, making
cybersecurity not just a function,

79
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:00,640
but a driver of enterprise growth.

80
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:06,159
This pyramid is showing you how
organizational transformation happens.

81
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,240
And it's very impact driven

82
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,160
from what we've seen so far.

83
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:19,070
The promise of networking and security
convergence is clear, and we also

84
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,800
looked at how this can be achieved, but.

85
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:26,375
Obviously it's easier
said than done, isn't it?

86
00:06:26,475 --> 00:06:29,565
Execution is not without,
its without its hurdles.

87
00:06:30,795 --> 00:06:32,505
Firstly, there's a skills gap.

88
00:06:32,745 --> 00:06:36,405
This is literally the
biggest concern out there.

89
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:43,095
This is basically a lack of professionals
who understand both domains deeply

90
00:06:43,095 --> 00:06:45,330
enough to lead the integration efforts.

91
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,120
Then there is organizational res
resistance where siloed teams

92
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,870
cling to traditional roles and
processes, making cross-functional

93
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,310
collaboration very difficult.

94
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,260
There's legacy infrastructure with which
further complicates things, and there's

95
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,790
outdated systems that aren't designed
to support converged architectures.

96
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,870
And finally, we've all heard it
budget constraints that often

97
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,450
delay progress and there are.

98
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:19,690
Just other costs that compete with
priorities, even in the long term.

99
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,560
The even if the ROI is compelling,
it's really hard to get that budget.

100
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,020
So addressing all of these
challenges is one of, one of the

101
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,250
great ways where you can make sure
that your execution can happen.

102
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,720
Now let's talk about a little bit
about the cloud integration strategy.

103
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,010
A successful cloud integration
strategy starts with visibility

104
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:49,350
comprehensively assessing your cloud
footprint to understand the services

105
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,780
data flows and their security needs.

106
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:58,350
Then it's critical to establish
multi-layer security parameters

107
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,220
that consistently enforce
access policies across hybrid

108
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,870
and multi-cloud environments.

109
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:10,140
Organizations must also deploy
converged control systems that unify

110
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:14,505
network and security management
into a single coherent framework.

111
00:08:15,405 --> 00:08:20,115
And finally, ongoing success depends
on continuous performance monitoring.

112
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:25,530
Using analytics to proactively
optimize both security posture

113
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,000
and network efficiency.

114
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:33,600
This cycle ensures resiliency, agility,
and control in any cloud environment.

115
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,550
A successful implementation of
converged networking and security

116
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,890
begins with assessment and planning.

117
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:47,440
Analyzing your current infrastructure,
identifying vulnerabilities, aligning

118
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,450
integration goals with business outcomes.

119
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,220
From there, team and technology
alignment is critical.

120
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,890
Breaking down those silos, implementing
unified platforms, training

121
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:04,120
cross-functional teams with the
right skillsets, and then finally,

122
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,950
implementation and optimization.

123
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,270
Deploy solutions in phases
to minimize disruption.

124
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,130
Use analytics to measure
impact and establish continuous

125
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,840
feedback loops for refinement.

126
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:22,300
This roadmap ensures that transformation
is both strategic and sustainable.

127
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:30,080
I wanted to give you a few examples
of organizations in specific verticals

128
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,000
that have actually achieved this.

129
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:39,000
For example, in the financial services
sector, a Fortune 500 bank was able

130
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,190
to cut security incidents by 35% while
also improving their transaction speeds.

131
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,970
And this was all due to their
integrated software defined networking.

132
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:56,860
In healthcare, there was a major hospital
that reduced breach containment from

133
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,640
over 48 hours to just under 60 minutes.

134
00:10:01,285 --> 00:10:05,665
And this was by deploying SASE
across its network and securing

135
00:10:05,665 --> 00:10:07,135
their sensitive patient data.

136
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:13,045
And the final example here is
in manufacturing where a global

137
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:19,045
leader protected their critical OT
systems and achieved 99.8% uptime

138
00:10:19,255 --> 00:10:22,465
by applying zero trust principles
across their infrastructures.

139
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,930
So these are not just
theoretical examples, right?

140
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,880
They are actually delivering measurable
impact across all the industries.

141
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:37,040
To build a resilient digital
future organization's mistake,

142
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,079
a strategic and phased approach.

143
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:43,819
Start by assessing your readiness,
understand your integration

144
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:47,990
maturity, and identify initiatives
with clear business impact.

145
00:10:49,235 --> 00:10:53,225
It's like they say start
small, but think big, right?

146
00:10:53,464 --> 00:10:59,105
So pilot targeted projects that
deliver value quickly while laying the

147
00:10:59,105 --> 00:11:01,235
foundation for scalable transformation.

148
00:11:01,925 --> 00:11:06,095
Foster collaboration across your
networking and security teams by

149
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:12,185
unifying goals, breaking down silos, and
finally embrace continuous evolution.

150
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:17,600
Adapt to emerging threats and technologies
through regular strategic reviews.

151
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,510
It's not just a one time project, it's
a living process that drives lasting

152
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,910
agility, security, and innovation.

153
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,260
Thank you all so much for
being here and listening to me.

154
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,920
I definitely enjoyed being
here and talking to you all.

155
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,180
See you next time.

156
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:35,605
Thank you so much.

157
00:11:36,365 --> 00:11:36,485
I.
