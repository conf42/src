1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:05,640
Hey everyone, my name is, and today
I'm gonna talk about a particular

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:12,270
section of US healthcare system where
the healthcare peers go out and do a

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,370
contract negotiation with the providers.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,200
Providers be being the practitioners,
the hospitals the provider

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,740
groups, and how can we utilize.

6
00:00:24,185 --> 00:00:27,935
AI to do those contract
negotiation better.

7
00:00:27,964 --> 00:00:31,894
What's the current state, the current
challenge and what's gonna be the

8
00:00:31,894 --> 00:00:35,595
future and what kind of solution
proposition that we're gonna talk

9
00:00:35,595 --> 00:00:37,455
about in this particular talk.

10
00:00:37,725 --> 00:00:41,415
So let's go ahead and get started.

11
00:00:42,235 --> 00:00:46,355
As some of you know us
healthcare system is quite big.

12
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:49,405
It's a trillion dollar industry where.

13
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:55,340
Various entities are involved and
contract negotiations specifically that

14
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,470
carries out between these two entities.

15
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:02,730
One being the healthcare peers, another
being the the, these, all these providers.

16
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:10,240
It's quite manual and paper-based and it's
oftentimes creates a lot of confusion.

17
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,560
So that leads to a payment error.

18
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:19,650
Negotiation, delay administrative overhead
and oftentimes also creates the stain in

19
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,910
the provider relationship with the payer.

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,180
So AI can make this much better,
where instead of having a static

21
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:33,010
manual driven payment method, we
can do some sort of data driven, AI

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,635
model driven payment contract where
the system can be much more fair.

23
00:01:39,105 --> 00:01:42,575
Accurate and efficient
in the whole process.

24
00:01:42,815 --> 00:01:49,055
So let's deep dive into, in, into
the talk more and see why, where we

25
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:51,005
are, what is the current challenge.

26
00:01:51,525 --> 00:01:52,875
As I already mentioned.

27
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,000
There are many challenges of today.

28
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,860
The number one, and most importantly,
is a manual process where we

29
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:05,020
have to spend a significant
time to do that, do to do that.

30
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,040
Contact reviews, and
there's a lot of to and fro.

31
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:13,875
With the providers where we have to
finalize the rate and then we need

32
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,815
to put that rates into the system.

33
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:17,885
So that's being one.

34
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:23,555
And as a subsequent, because of
those manual negotiation, and

35
00:02:23,555 --> 00:02:25,385
oftentimes that gets to a human error.

36
00:02:25,555 --> 00:02:30,835
There's a payment discrepancy, and because
of this payment discrepancy, the providers

37
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:35,425
are oftentimes are disa dissatisfied
because they don't get the payment on

38
00:02:35,425 --> 00:02:39,395
time and and leads to like unhappiness.

39
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,430
And the most importantly from a healthcare
peers perspective, because you have

40
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:51,220
a department who goes out and do this
contract negotiation with the providers.

41
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,870
You have so many people involved
doing various contracts, be it

42
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,460
practitioners, be it hospitals.

43
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,280
Oftentimes hospital
contracts are quite complex.

44
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,540
So you need to, and there are so many
hospitals in a particular zip code,

45
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,010
in, not in a particular county where.

46
00:03:08,395 --> 00:03:11,545
The insurance company has to
go out and do this contracting,

47
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:16,465
and then that's a department
overall overhaul and the burden.

48
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:20,725
But but if we continue to do that,
it would be a quite significant

49
00:03:20,725 --> 00:03:25,715
challenge that, that currently
health healthcare system faces.

50
00:03:26,465 --> 00:03:32,175
And with that, it also creates, as I
said some sort of stained relationship.

51
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:39,215
With the providers because this process
is not so smooth and it lacks that the

52
00:03:39,215 --> 00:03:43,885
data-driven decision making that we are
talk, gonna talk about in the stock.

53
00:03:44,784 --> 00:03:46,614
Now we know the challenge.

54
00:03:46,744 --> 00:03:48,494
We know where we are.

55
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:55,519
Coming from now, let's talk about what
are the advantage that AI can solve.

56
00:03:55,849 --> 00:04:00,979
The number one being is the predictive
analysis, meaning we can forecast

57
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:03,589
some sort of optimal rate while.

58
00:04:03,934 --> 00:04:08,975
Doing the negotiation by utilizing
historical data market trends

59
00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:10,744
and some sort of pattern.

60
00:04:10,894 --> 00:04:14,584
So that helps to do a negotiation.

61
00:04:14,584 --> 00:04:16,084
What would be the future rate?

62
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:21,824
Be it, say, office visit, be it a PCV
visit, or be it your specialist visit

63
00:04:21,914 --> 00:04:24,305
for a particular specialty or whatnot.

64
00:04:24,605 --> 00:04:27,760
And it also gives a real time adjustment.

65
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:35,689
Because it's a data driven dynamic we can
adjust to that contract more of a real

66
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:41,539
time than somebody has to go over manually
do that adjustment, put their correction

67
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:45,469
into the system, and then during the
claim processing, it'll pick it up.

68
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:49,629
But if we use some kind of a AI
driven solution, it'll be more

69
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:54,309
of a real time, faster, smooth,
efficient and that brings to the.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,380
Third point is a error prevention
because we are doing everything

71
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:04,289
through some sort of a AI tool
driven approach data-driven approach.

72
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:10,380
It's more of a errorless system
than to have somebody or a group

73
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,659
of people to go over manually.

74
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,020
Review that, put it in the system.

75
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:20,719
So it makes it much more fairer system,
much more efficient system, and as a

76
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:26,020
result, the relationship between the
provider and the peer is much more better.

77
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:32,219
It makes the working environment also
smooth and providers a happy and that

78
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:34,740
makes also the peer also makes happy.

79
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:41,635
Now let's look at some of the
leading examples in terms of what

80
00:05:41,635 --> 00:05:43,915
are the industry leaders are doing.

81
00:05:44,065 --> 00:05:48,985
So here I have taken some of the
examples where, for example, there is

82
00:05:48,985 --> 00:05:54,104
an, there's a company called Cognizant
who has many many softwares that

83
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,664
caters to the need of healthcare.

84
00:05:55,694 --> 00:06:00,689
One being the networks modeler,
where we can utilize those modeling.

85
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:07,650
Methodology to predict the future price
so that during contract negotiation,

86
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:12,080
the providers can know what will
be the rate change, say for a given

87
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,280
year there's a particular rate.

88
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,999
And the future year, the next
year, there will be a rate change.

89
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:22,919
If we utilize the historical data
pattern, make some predictive modeling

90
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:27,619
and tell them this much, a percentage
will be increased for a given service.

91
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,179
It makes it much more fairer.

92
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:35,560
And there's another leading
Medicaid healthcare peers health

93
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:41,630
s they also often use AI driven
approaches where they found it.

94
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:46,970
It tends to lead a reduced time
while doing all this negotiation.

95
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,960
And then we have United Healthcare where.

96
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:55,695
It's one of the leading healthcare
system in the United States.

97
00:06:55,785 --> 00:07:03,155
They reported like $110
billion for Q1 2025 revenue.

98
00:07:03,185 --> 00:07:06,245
So you can guess how big it is They.

99
00:07:06,435 --> 00:07:11,114
These companies are utilizing various
sort of AI driven methodology to

100
00:07:11,114 --> 00:07:15,195
do the contract negotiation because
that helps the entire processes

101
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:17,085
faster and efficient and the smooth.

102
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:22,884
Now let's take a look at the framework,
like what kind of, optimization that

103
00:07:22,884 --> 00:07:24,714
we can do with that data driven.

104
00:07:24,984 --> 00:07:30,284
Now the most important thing
is it makes the process smooth.

105
00:07:30,794 --> 00:07:35,924
Meaning I don't have to deal with all the
paper contracts, I don't have to deal with

106
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,424
going through each of these terminology.

107
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:42,624
I don't have to deal with going
through each of these contract rates,

108
00:07:42,775 --> 00:07:45,414
historical data manually, rather.

109
00:07:45,504 --> 00:07:50,559
It's more of a. Data driven
outcomes, and it can easily be

110
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,870
automated into the workflow system.

111
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:57,080
Meaning if there are multiple system,
one does the capitation, one does

112
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,010
the claim adjudication one does the
validation, one does the clinical edits,

113
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,760
all various system does its job in silos.

114
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,050
But if we utilize.

115
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,880
Some data driven approach where we
can integrate that into the workflow.

116
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:17,530
And during claim adjudication, every
diff every different parts of the engine

117
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,180
can talk to each other, and the entire
process can be very comprehensive.

118
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,670
And the claim processing
is gonna be very smooth.

119
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,260
Now let's look at the
business measures like.

120
00:08:29,585 --> 00:08:33,215
What can we achieve by utilizing
these AI driven solutions?

121
00:08:33,395 --> 00:08:38,295
Now, there are several case studies
where performed where they have studied

122
00:08:38,295 --> 00:08:44,510
various aspect of utilizing AI in this
AI driven contract rate negotiation.

123
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,400
The major ones is how soon, how
fast we can lock in the contracts

124
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,180
do we save any dollar value,
and do we increase the fairness?

125
00:08:54,395 --> 00:08:56,615
And satisfaction with the providers.

126
00:08:56,825 --> 00:08:58,385
And the answer is yes too.

127
00:08:58,565 --> 00:09:02,435
And there are some case studies
were performed where they have

128
00:09:02,435 --> 00:09:04,505
found close to 42 percentage.

129
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:09,785
They were able to lock in the
contract and it was way more faster.

130
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:14,265
And that lead to a significant
dollar value save on a when

131
00:09:14,265 --> 00:09:15,675
this particular case study were.

132
00:09:15,745 --> 00:09:20,395
Perform on a lesser number of
contract, not on a large scale.

133
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:25,245
And this also helped with the
provider disputes because the new

134
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:27,795
art system is very fair and clean.

135
00:09:27,975 --> 00:09:31,485
The disputes were very LA
and everybody was happy.

136
00:09:31,635 --> 00:09:37,395
So it's definitely there was a miserable
business impact and it help the system

137
00:09:37,395 --> 00:09:42,895
overall and makes the payer system to go
towards more this data-driven solution.

138
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,170
Now we talked about the challenges.

139
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,490
We talked about the various
entities that they are utilizing

140
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,020
these AI driven solutions.

141
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,860
We are talk, we talked about what
kind of outcome that we are expecting.

142
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:03,180
Now, if we have to implement, we as
in any healthcare payer system has

143
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,520
to implement this AI driven solution.

144
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,480
What are the stages?

145
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,950
What are the steps that they can do?

146
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,870
The first and the most important is like.

147
00:10:10,405 --> 00:10:15,545
Assessing your current state, where
we are do we use a legacy system?

148
00:10:15,635 --> 00:10:17,585
What kind of data that we have?

149
00:10:17,705 --> 00:10:23,165
Can we transfer the data from one system
to another system so you identify the gap

150
00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:30,235
and potentially make this quantify can we
quantify where and how can we implement?

151
00:10:30,235 --> 00:10:33,485
And the second thing
will be define strategy.

152
00:10:33,485 --> 00:10:36,965
We have to implement some sort
of a AI tool, which AI tool is

153
00:10:36,965 --> 00:10:39,430
the best to solve that need.

154
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:43,390
And we also have to establish
some kind of a governance because

155
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:47,020
healthcare is all about governance,
where data is very important.

156
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,920
So we set up this governance, we set
up the criteria, we set up the right

157
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,650
tool, and then we phase out this.

158
00:10:53,675 --> 00:10:55,985
Deployment in multiple phases.

159
00:10:55,985 --> 00:11:01,055
Phase one being we piloted out
with a less number of contracts.

160
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,520
And see the results see the
improvement, quantify that.

161
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:11,350
And once that is being done, we can
integrate that solution into a large

162
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:16,660
scale with a large number of contract
and see how that's, that is doing.

163
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:22,020
And we some kind of a figure out, some
kind of an ROI and quantify the entire.

164
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:22,750
Results.

165
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,540
Now the next one is, okay.

166
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:25,840
What?

167
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,800
It's fine.

168
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,580
We can do that.

169
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,840
What is the best practice?

170
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,940
Of course, the best
practice is always gonna be.

171
00:11:31,545 --> 00:11:32,745
Assessing your system.

172
00:11:32,745 --> 00:11:34,395
Are you coming from a legacy system?

173
00:11:34,395 --> 00:11:38,985
If you are coming from a legacy system,
can we exchange those data from a legacy

174
00:11:38,985 --> 00:11:42,735
system to your newer AI driven system?

175
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,635
And if we do, what kind of
efforts that you need to do?

176
00:11:46,755 --> 00:11:51,345
And once you implement, you also
have to train your staff who has to.

177
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:55,610
Utilize those tools, how to handle
it, how to run it, how to do

178
00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:01,165
this do how to do run the entire
workflow into your existing system.

179
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:05,305
And then of course, as I said,
you also have to employ some

180
00:12:05,305 --> 00:12:10,205
kind of an governance because US
healthcare system is quite regulated.

181
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,525
We have to follow various
regulations and the rules.

182
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:16,735
So we have to have some kind
of a governance and once.

183
00:12:16,975 --> 00:12:17,965
All this done.

184
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:22,425
We make sure everything is
implemented correctly and fairly.

185
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:25,605
And then as a result, what
would, what is the outcome?

186
00:12:25,605 --> 00:12:27,105
What is the ROI, what is the KPI?

187
00:12:27,115 --> 00:12:29,195
And we can measure all sort of stuff.

188
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:36,245
Now the one that I have talked many
times because of this manual as of

189
00:12:36,245 --> 00:12:41,205
today approach where it oftentimes
leads to a provider dissatisfaction.

190
00:12:41,415 --> 00:12:46,035
But if we implement this newer AI driven
solution, it's more of a fair rate.

191
00:12:46,425 --> 00:12:51,205
Settings where data-driven approach
creates this this contract with the

192
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:56,545
provider and it's trend, then the
relationship with the providers and when

193
00:12:56,545 --> 00:13:00,805
the contract rates are set using more
of a transparent data-driven framework,

194
00:13:01,015 --> 00:13:05,965
both parties are happy and it makes
the process itself is quite smooth.

195
00:13:06,225 --> 00:13:07,625
So this definitely helped.

196
00:13:07,795 --> 00:13:11,015
To the to this relationship
between the provider and the payer.

197
00:13:11,195 --> 00:13:14,345
And it also helps to make
the payment system is more

198
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:16,565
transparent and predictable.

199
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:21,885
Meaning when we use any kind of AI
tool, use the historical data, run the

200
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:27,105
predictive model, model the future price,
and go with this negotiation and say,

201
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:29,145
this is gonna be the rate for, say.

202
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,540
Say a particular specialist
visit for in our office settings.

203
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,910
And if it is fair, it's all
predictable, transparent, and that

204
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:42,210
will also help the provider to
understand what they're gonna be paid.

205
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:47,340
And the entire process is very very
laid out, integrated in the workflow.

206
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,300
Everybody's happy.

207
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,200
Now the future innovation.

208
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,980
Now, when we are here, we also
have to look at, okay, fine, we can

209
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,030
utilize the ai, why, where the AI
stands as of today, where we are

210
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:04,080
going, and what kind of different
methodology that we can implement.

211
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:08,250
The first being is the natural
language processing, the NLP

212
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,800
most heavily used in the ai.

213
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,320
Wherever we implement where we can.

214
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:21,860
Take any data, extract it, and interpret
to the right contract language so we can

215
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,470
totally eliminate this manual review.

216
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:30,810
So that's probably one of the best use
case of AI that we can do in this context.

217
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,470
And another one is gonna be we can
utilize the blockchain based payment.

218
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:39,530
Some of the healthcare system already
started doing it more of a in-house closed

219
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,310
blockchain system where the payment to the
provider or some kind of a decision making

220
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,980
happens automatic with a smart contract.

221
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:47,440
Yeah.

222
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,430
And the third one is being the market.

223
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,850
Adaptive contracts, like oftentimes
healthcare system is keep changing,

224
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,140
regulation, keep changing.

225
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:02,880
There is CMS, there is state and
everybody makes their changes on time.

226
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,570
So if there is a change happens,
and because we utilize some sort

227
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,610
of a AI driven solution, we can.

228
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:13,490
Adapt to this market strategy on the
go and implement the solution much more

229
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:18,920
quicker so that claim processing can
happen on the up to date market data.

230
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,540
And the last, and most importantly,
is the value based optimization.

231
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,590
Because AI can align your payment based
on the value of certain predefined

232
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:32,790
task, the member can do or the
provider can do based on that, the

233
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,410
payment can be made and scheduled.

234
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,470
And the last but not the least, I wanted
to end this talk with this particular

235
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,950
closing remark is AI is here to stay.

236
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:52,070
It will shape and help many aspect of
our life, not necessarily the healthcare

237
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:56,750
system specifically in our talk that
involves related to the provider

238
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,690
contracting world between the peer.

239
00:15:59,965 --> 00:16:01,045
And the providers.

240
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:05,335
It has many element, integr
and the complexity involved.

241
00:16:05,485 --> 00:16:11,245
If we adapt today, we know in the
future we can utilize those tools

242
00:16:11,425 --> 00:16:14,035
and make the system much more fairer.

243
00:16:14,845 --> 00:16:17,755
Efficient and make everybody's happy.

244
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:22,705
So overall, it'll also help the
members who can go to the provider

245
00:16:22,705 --> 00:16:26,005
and get the service provider is
happy to provide the service.

246
00:16:26,215 --> 00:16:27,715
So overall, this is the future.

247
00:16:27,715 --> 00:16:32,425
I can see AI is here and it's
gonna be implemented in this

248
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,465
particular section, I hope.

249
00:16:34,545 --> 00:16:39,525
Everybody had a good time listening
to me and with this closing remark I

250
00:16:39,525 --> 00:16:42,885
wanted to say, if you really wanted to
talk to me regarding this particular

251
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:45,165
topic, please ping me in LinkedIn.

252
00:16:45,195 --> 00:16:47,985
I'm happy to assist and help you on that.

253
00:16:48,135 --> 00:16:52,045
Thank you so much for listening
and tuning on this talk.
