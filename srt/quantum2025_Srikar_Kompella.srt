00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:41,845
Possibilities simultaneously, this results
in exponential speed up for certain

59
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:44,364
types of problems for a SaaS platform.

60
00:03:44,545 --> 00:03:49,464
This means being able to offer solutions
to complex optimization challenges

61
00:03:49,464 --> 00:03:53,824
such as organizing global supply
chains with millions of variables or

62
00:03:53,824 --> 00:03:55,984
designing complex financial portfolios.

63
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,869
In minutes instead of
years, intelligent insights.

64
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:04,549
The ability of quantum algorithms to
analyze high dimensional data allows

65
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:06,109
for a deeper level of insights.

66
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:10,219

Quantum enhanced SaaS could run complex
simulations to foresee future outcomes

77
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:46,125
with a higher degree of confidence.

78
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:51,294
For example, a financial services platform
could more accurately model market

79
00:04:51,294 --> 00:04:53,484
volatility and predict economic trends.

80
00:04:53,814 --> 00:04:58,434
A healthcare SaaS could forecast a
spread of a disease by modeling countless

81
00:04:58,434 --> 00:05:02,634
environmental, social, and biological
factors enabling proactive public

82
00:05:02,634 --> 00:05:04,894
health responses than reactive ones.

83
00:05:05,394 --> 00:05:06,534
Business transformations.

84
00:05:06,594 --> 00:05:10,854
Ultimately, the integration of quantum
computing will enable the creation of

85
00:05:10,854 --> 00:05:13,044
entirely new business models and services.

86
00:05:13,434 --> 00:05:17,214
The impact goes beyond just
improving existing applications.

87
00:05:17,454 --> 00:05:19,584
It's offering solutions
that were previously in the

88
00:05:19,584 --> 00:05:20,724
realm of science fiction.

89
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:24,444
A SaaS company could transition
from selling software.

90
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:29,679
To sending answers, offering optimization
as a service or material discovery

91
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:33,789
as a service that empowers business
to operate in radically new ways.

92
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:39,809
Fostering innovation and creating that
will redefine entire industries quantum.

93
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:44,069
So now if you take a look at the
quantum enhanced Edge computing.

94
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:48,949
The fusion of quantum enhanced edge
quantum computing and edge processing

95
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:52,969
creates a revolutionary distributed
intelligence layer, fundamentally

96
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:55,399
reshaping how applications deliver value.

97
00:05:55,849 --> 00:05:59,689
The powerful combination overcomes
from the inheritant limitations of

98
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:04,039
each technology, the physical distance
to powerful centralized quantum

99
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:06,129
computers are the limited computational.

100
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:10,609
Capacity of local edge devices
by strategically placing quantum

101
00:06:10,609 --> 00:06:14,929
enhanced algorithms directly
where the data is generated.

102
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:18,069
The architecture el eliminates
the critical bottlenecks

103
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:20,979
enabling new generation of
intelligent real-time services.

104
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,010
Redistributed workloads.

105
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,669
This model represents a
significant architectural shift.

106
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:31,310
Instead of sending vast streams of
raw data to distant quantum computer

107
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,469
analysis, the workload is redistributed.

108
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:38,940
Complex models originally trained
on the quantum computer are deployed

109
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,980
to a local run edge services.

110
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,850
This means the sophisticated
processing happens closer to the users.

111
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:49,775
Closer to that data sources yielding
transformative benefits, which could

112
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:55,185
be minimized latency reduced bandwidth
and real time quantum intelligence.

113
00:06:55,185 --> 00:06:58,844
So this is important as it tell
us applications to leverage

114
00:06:58,844 --> 00:07:02,625
the analytical depth of quantum
computing without the typical delay.

115
00:07:03,015 --> 00:07:07,345
A factory flow robot, for example,
can use a quantum applications in all.

116
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:11,505
To instantly adjust its actions
rather than waiting on instructions

117
00:07:11,505 --> 00:07:12,585
from the central server.

118
00:07:12,945 --> 00:07:16,275
So novel applications part, take
a look at the novel applications.

119
00:07:16,275 --> 00:07:21,615
The pot combination of quantum
intelligence and edge deployment makes

120
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:24,315
entirely new categories of application.

121
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,970
Computationally feasible
for the first time.

122
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,230
The ability to perform complex
analysis with near zero latency

123
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,730
unlocks the possibilities that were
previously confined to theory, real

124
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,680
time optimization of complex systems.

125
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:42,750
Imagine a city's traffic grid worthy
edge devices in every intersection.

126
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,050
Sorry IT devices in real section.

127
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:46,385
Imagine.

128
00:07:46,885 --> 00:07:50,115
The city traffic grid where the,
it's in every intersection can

129
00:07:50,115 --> 00:07:53,745
use the quantum algorithms to
continuously optimize signal timing.

130
00:07:54,645 --> 00:07:58,965
Responding instantaneously
to live traffic on device.

131
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:00,015
Quantum machine learning.

132
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:04,665
A mobile device or a smart variable
could use a quantum machine

133
00:08:04,665 --> 00:08:08,055
learning model to provide truly
personalized user experiences.

134
00:08:08,505 --> 00:08:13,415
Advanced onset simulations as an engineer
at a construction site could use a

135
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,380
ruggedized tablet to run the quantum
powered simulations of material stress or

136
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,520
environment factors getting intermediate.

137
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,390
Highly accurate insights to inform
the critical decisions on the

138
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,790
spot autonomous decision making.

139
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,460
This is the ultimate goal for many
systems and autonomous vehicle.

140
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:36,820
Liquid quantum enhanced edge intelligence
could make more sophisticated, safer,

141
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,525
and more ethical decisions in a
complex, unpredictable environments.

142
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:47,025
Now let's take a look at the
evolution of the multi-tenancy models.

143
00:08:47,555 --> 00:08:52,985
So the evolution of multi-tenancy
reflects a simple shift from being cost

144
00:08:52,985 --> 00:08:58,005
savings to a sophisticated architecture
that leverages quantum computing to

145
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:02,085
intelligently optimize shared resources
while providing strong security.

146
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,490
So basic resource sharing
in initial stages.

147
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,370
It involves like simple infrastructure
partitioning, which will need to

148
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:13,050
minimal isolation between the tenants,
focusing primarily on reducing costs.

149
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,770
Advanced segmentation, a more
mature model that provides

150
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,960
sophisticated and logical separation.

151
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,030
While tenant share common services.

152
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,810
Their data and processing workflows
are kept securely isolated.

153
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:29,605
Quantum Air architectures the most
advanced stage where the architecture

154
00:09:29,605 --> 00:09:34,385
uses quantum capabilities to dynamically
and intelligently allocate resources.

155
00:09:34,685 --> 00:09:38,855
It optimizes performance across all
tenant boundaries, still wearing the

156
00:09:38,855 --> 00:09:42,790
tailored experience with economic
advantages of shared infrastructure.

157
00:09:43,675 --> 00:09:47,065
Now let's take a look at
the integrated pattern.

158
00:09:47,315 --> 00:09:48,945
Quantum federated learning.

159
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:54,855
Quantum federated learning provides an
elegant and highly secure solution to one

160
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:56,745
of the biggest challenges in data science.

161
00:09:56,795 --> 00:10:02,135
How to train a powerful, centralized
AI model without ever compromising on

162
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:04,225
privacy of individual data sources.

163
00:10:04,615 --> 00:10:08,185
This integration pattern allows SaaS
platform to build corrective intelligence.

164
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:12,625
Learning from the distributed data
of all its tenants while ensuring

165
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:16,805
each tenant sensitive information
remains completely isolated and

166
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:18,515
protected within their own environment.

167
00:10:19,015 --> 00:10:23,225
So this process unfolds in
a distinct cyclical pattern.

168
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:28,335
The local quantum model training,
the process begins with each

169
00:10:28,335 --> 00:10:29,745
tenant secure infrastructure.

170
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:35,205
For example, tenant a, a. A hospital
or a tenant, BA research institute

171
00:10:35,205 --> 00:10:36,945
both have their own private data sets.

172
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:40,815
The SaaS platform provides it
sophisticated quantum machine

173
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:43,245
learning model to each one of them.

174
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:47,285
Each tenant then trains this
model locally on their own data.

175
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:51,155
The hospital model learns to identify
the patterns in its patient data.

176
00:10:51,455 --> 00:10:54,395
The research institute model learns
from its experimental results.

177
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,320
Crucially, the raw dataset
never leaves the tenant secure

178
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,960
perimeter secure model aggregation.

179
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,440
Once the local training is complete,
attendances don't share their data.

180
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,850
Instead, they share their abstract
mathematical learnings, the updates, or

181
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,000
gradients from their respective models.

182
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,110
The knowledge sharing is
protected by the advanced quantum.

183
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,240
Resistant cryptographic protocols.

184
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:22,750
The SaaS platform acts as the
secure coordinator gathering

185
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,850
these encrypted model updates.

186
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,630
This ensures that the shared information
cannot be reverse engineered to

187
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:33,400
reveal any underlying private data
creation of an enhanced global model.

188
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,620
The central platform aggregates the.

189
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,850
Anonymized updates from all
the participating tenants.

190
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:44,170
By combining these divine insights,
it creates a new global model that

191
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,430
is far more intelligent, robust and
accurate than any other individual

192
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,800
local models that could be on their own.

193
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,640
It has learned from e much wider
and more varied pool of experience,

194
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,410
reducing bias, and improving its
spread to power for everyone.

195
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,290
Distribution of collective intelligence.

196
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,430
This enhanced global model is
then distributed back to all.

197
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,440
Participating tenants tenant A and
tenant B can now use more powerful

198
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,060
model for their own purposes.

199
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,580
This directly benefiting from the
collective intelligence of the

200
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,810
entire ecosystem without having
sacrificing an ounce of privacy.

201
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,950
The quantum advantage in this
pattern is basically twofold.

202
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:27,210
It refers not only to the superior
pattern recognition abilities

203
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,060
of the quantum machine learning
models used for the training.

204
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,720
But also the advanced cryptographic
techniques that provide a higher level

205
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,000
of security for the entire process.

206
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,950
Now let's take a look at
the integration pattern.

207
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,690
The customized quantum edge deployments.

208
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,140
The pattern highly creates a highly
adaptive, intelligent network that

209
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,800
delivers customized performance
by strategically deploying

210
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,570
quantum capabilities to the edge.

211
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:57,910
It allows a SaaS provider to cater
to unique needs of each tenant while

212
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,280
maximizing the platform wide efficiency.

213
00:13:00,755 --> 00:13:03,125
Tenant specific quantum algorithms.

214
00:13:03,395 --> 00:13:07,775
Custom quantum solutions are deployed to
edge locations based on specific tenant

215
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:11,765
unique requirements and usage patterns,
intelligent workload distribution.

216
00:13:12,185 --> 00:13:18,125
The system smartly routes processing tasks
between other local quantum edge notes and

217
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,045
centralized quantum computers to ensure.

218
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:24,395
Optimal performance and efficiency
adapt to resource allocation.

219
00:13:24,395 --> 00:13:27,755
The quantum processing power is
dynamically shifted across the

220
00:13:28,055 --> 00:13:32,045
edge network in real time, moving
to wherever the demand is highest.

221
00:13:32,435 --> 00:13:36,515
The network is self-improving system,
constantly learning from performance

222
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,995
data to evolve and refine its deployment.

223
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,395
Patents automatically.

224
00:13:41,895 --> 00:13:47,785
Now let's take a look at the integration
pattern of the quantum machine learning.

225
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:52,485
The pattern uses the QML to create
a self optimize SaaS platform.

226
00:13:53,055 --> 00:13:53,415
Okay?

227
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,685
This pattern that intelligently
manages its own resources.

228
00:13:57,185 --> 00:14:01,265
It moves beyond reactive allocation
to proactively participate

229
00:14:01,265 --> 00:14:02,825
the needs of every tenant.

230
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:07,695
This process is a continuous loop,
continuous monitoring the system,

231
00:14:07,695 --> 00:14:11,550
watches system wide performance
and usage metrics in real time.

232
00:14:12,475 --> 00:14:18,935
The quantum prediction, A QML model
and analyzes the data to accurately

233
00:14:18,935 --> 00:14:23,555
forecast future resource demands
across all tenants optimal allocation

234
00:14:23,555 --> 00:14:28,915
based on the forecast, the platform
automatically allocates infrastructure

235
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:34,095
to meet the upcoming needs, ensuring
maximum efficiency and performance.

236
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:36,765
This creates a highly efficient system.

237
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,840
That learns and improves over time.

238
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:43,220
Ensuring resources are always
where they need to be before the

239
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,300
tenant even knows they need them.

240
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,830
Now let's move forward to integration
patterns, secure tenant collaboration.

241
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:55,020
The integration pattern transforms
SaaS platform from a collection

242
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,530
of isolated customer silos into
a secure collaborator ecosystem.

243
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:03,990
It uses quantum technology to overcome
the significant trust and security

244
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,210
barriers that traditionally prevent
companies from being working together.

245
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:13,110
By enabling secure data sharing and
joint processing at the edge, tenants

246
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:17,270
can solve these problems by and
build collective intelligence without

247
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,785
ever exposing their sensitive data.

248
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,560
Quantum Secure Data Exchange.

249
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:26,310
So this is a, an exchange that goes
beyond the standard en encryption.

250
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,610
It involves quantum resistant
cryptography to protect the

251
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,080
data shared between tenants.

252
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:36,810
This ensures that any exchange
information is secure not only today,

253
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,800
but also against the future threat of
the quantum computers being used to

254
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,890
break the current encryptions standards.

255
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,570
Collaborative processing.

256
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,040
So this pattern allows multiple tenants
to pull the, their resources to, to

257
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:54,350
tackle the common challenges using
advanced quantum enhanced privacy.

258
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,985
Pre preserving techniques,
tenants can contribute insights

259
00:15:57,985 --> 00:16:01,135
from their data without ever
revealing the raw data itself.

260
00:16:01,765 --> 00:16:04,885
For example, several competing
retail companies could elaborate to

261
00:16:04,885 --> 00:16:08,635
identify large scale supply chain
inefficiencies that affect them all.

262
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,385
Industry specific knowledge networks.

263
00:16:11,385 --> 00:16:16,365
This builds on the first two points to
create a spec specialized communities.

264
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:21,405
The SaaS platform can become a host for
industry specific consortiums, where

265
00:16:21,405 --> 00:16:26,265
the tenants can safely share knowledge,
insights, and benchmark performances.

266
00:16:26,765 --> 00:16:31,505
Now let's take a look at the economic
impact of the Quantum Enhanced SaaS.

267
00:16:31,505 --> 00:16:35,845
Now, if we take a look at this chart
has a various comparisons of traditional

268
00:16:35,845 --> 00:16:38,095
SaaS and quantum enhanced SaaS.

269
00:16:38,425 --> 00:16:43,755
The economic advantages of SaaS have
always been centered around shared

270
00:16:43,755 --> 00:16:45,405
infrastructure and economies at Square.

271
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,000
Quantum enhancers simplifies
these benefits through superior

272
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,800
resource optimization, unprecedented
computational capabilities, and

273
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,360
intelligent workload distribution.

274
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,730
Our analysis shows a significant
improvements across all

275
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,140
key performance indicators.

276
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,080
When comparing traditional SaaS
two quantum enhanced architectures.

277
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,710
The most dramatic gains appear in
the data processing capacity and

278
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,790
predictive accuracy, where quantum
algorithms provide exponential

279
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,220
advantages over classical approaches.

280
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,960
Now let's take away let's take a
look at the key takeaways of an

281
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,230
implementation roadmap for the companies.

282
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:25,370
The quantum acceleration of SaaS is a
transform IT opportunity that requires

283
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,290
a deliberate and a phased approach.

284
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,010
Leaders who successfully integrate
these pillars of quantum computing, edge

285
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:35,440
processing and advanced multi-tenancy
will create an unmatched value.

286
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,610
This roadmap outlines how
to begin that journey.

287
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,410
Phase one assess the current architecture.

288
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,410
The foundational step is about
understanding your starting point.

289
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,190
Before integrating new technologies,
you must perform a thorough

290
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:52,060
evaluation of your existing platform
to identify the most promising

291
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,980
opportunities for quantum enhancement.

292
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:58,000
Evaluate quantum readiness and analyze
your SaaS platform to see where

293
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,530
its current architecture stands.

294
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,860
Identify the high value
computationally intensive workloads

295
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,540
such as complex financial modeling.

296
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,030
Logical optimization or large,
its AI training that are currently

297
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,510
limited by classical computing
map existing capabilities.

298
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,230
Document your current edge
processing capabilities and

299
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,530
assess this sophistication
of your multi-tenancy model.

300
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,400
This map will reveal where
you can most easily plug in

301
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,870
your new integration patterns.

302
00:18:25,635 --> 00:18:27,245
Pilot integration patterns.

303
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:31,325
The goal of this space is to
start small, learn quickly, and

304
00:18:31,325 --> 00:18:32,795
prove value with minimal risk.

305
00:18:33,215 --> 00:18:38,015
Instead of attending a platform
wide overhaul, focus on targeted

306
00:18:38,015 --> 00:18:40,745
pilot project that aligns with
the key strategic objective.

307
00:18:41,105 --> 00:18:42,625
Select a single pilot.

308
00:18:42,745 --> 00:18:46,195
Choose one of the integration patterns
such as Quantum Federated Learning

309
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:51,115
or QML Driven Resource Orchestration
apply to a well-defined problem where

310
00:18:51,115 --> 00:18:53,175
potential for it improvement is high.

311
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:54,465
Measure and learn.

312
00:18:54,465 --> 00:18:57,815
The primary goal of this is
to generate data and insights.

313
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:01,775
Mely measure the performance
improvements such as reduced latency or.

314
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:06,500
Increased model accuracy, gather
qualitative feedback from users and

315
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,440
stakeholders to understand the real
world impact scale and optimize.

316
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:15,970
So once this pilot has demonstrated
clear and measurable value, this phase

317
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,010
focuses on expanding its success to.

318
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,630
Embedding quantum capabilities
into your platform's.

319
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:25,270
DNA, expand and integrate the take
the lessons learn from the successful

320
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,260
pilot and begin a broader rollout.

321
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:32,620
This may involve developing quantum native
features and more deeply integrating the

322
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,100
new architecture into your core product.

323
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,780
Built in-house expertise scaling quantum
capabilities requires scaling your

324
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,550
team, invest in training and hiring.

325
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:45,815
To build in-house expertise in
quantum enhanced SaaS architecture,

326
00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:49,205
this internal knowledge is
crucial for long-term success.

327
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,085
Continuously refine the quantum landscape.

328
00:19:52,115 --> 00:19:54,635
Is there constantly evolving?

329
00:19:54,685 --> 00:19:56,035
Treat a paradigm.

330
00:19:56,365 --> 00:20:00,655
Treat your implementation as living
system continuously refining your approach

331
00:20:00,655 --> 00:20:02,480
based on real world performance metrics.

332
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:04,495
And emerging technologies.

333
00:20:04,765 --> 00:20:09,685
The path to quantum transformation is an
evolution, not an overnight revolution.
