00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,340
Speaker 48: Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:03,350
I hope you're enjoying
the conference so far.

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,720
My name is Vishnu Kumar and I'm a supply
chain management solution architect,

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,340
primarily focusing on warehouse
management, optimization and automation.

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,660
Today I would like to talk to you
about site level engineering for

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,379
supply chain management which can be
used to build reliable warehouses for.

7
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,319
Making use of the human and AI
factors, combining them and then

8
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:32,389
making the warehouses more reliable
to meet the growing demands of today.

9
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:35,479
Let's get into it during this session.

10
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:38,639
Whenever you're watching the session,
if you have any questions, please

11
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,379
feel free to reach out to me.

12
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:41,909
You can connect with me on LinkedIn.

13
00:00:42,099 --> 00:00:44,620
I'm always open to answering questions.

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,190
All right, so now let's talk
about supply chain in general.

15
00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:56,380
Now supply chain to simply put
it, is to transport goods from

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,730
point A to point B, right?

17
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,720
That's the most simplest of
explanations anyone can give for

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,960
supply chain management to take
items from point A to point B.

19
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,000
Now what people.

20
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,670
Outside of supply chain do not understand
is how difficult it is to get items from

21
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:16,030
point A to point B is, and what happens
in those huge buildings trying to take

22
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,650
items from point A to point B, right?

23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,510
That's what supply chain is all about.

24
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,464
And that is my area of work where
we try to optimize the systems,

25
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:26,670
optimize the processes make efficient.

26
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,940
Business practices within the warehouses
so that the 0.8 point B transfer can be

27
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,500
done effectively economically and quickly.

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,770
So in today's world with e-commerce,
the boom in e-commerce, right?

29
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,930
People are purchasing stuff online
all the time, and the demand for.

30
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:51,650
Fast warehouses, fast shipping, fast
order processing has grown multifold.

31
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:57,630
So that has resulted in
unprecedented in an unprecedented

32
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,820
growth in the supply chain space.

33
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,830
Now, when we talk about.

34
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,520
The recent advancements in supply chain.

35
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,750
We talk about integrations
with iot sensors.

36
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,930
We talk about integrations with
ai, we talk about disturb twins,

37
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,460
we talk about all that, right?

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,070
But what we don't gently talk about
is how supply chain management and how

39
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:26,370
warehouse management is not getting
the attention that other areas get.

40
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,400
Say like cloud systems, right?

41
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:36,090
It's something that many companies or
many organizations neglect or do not

42
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,260
pay much attention to and then end up,
trying to optimize it at a later stage.

43
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,560
So that is something I would
like to talk about today.

44
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,900
Now, production grade reliability
practices is something that we

45
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,660
are focusing on, where I'm going
to talk about how these systems.

46
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:59,020
Need monitoring and optimizing early
on, even when these systems are being

47
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,880
designed and put in place, even during
the implementation phase of these systems,

48
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,920
if you can I incorporate these components
into it and how it can turn the system

49
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,420
and the overall warehouse efficient,
the overall supply chain efficient.

50
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:19,609
And we'll also be talking about how,
the system can incorporate both the

51
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:25,739
human and the AI elements, combine
it, and then use it to give much

52
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,420
faster, much efficient throughputs.

53
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:35,700
Right now, what's the challenge
in modern day warehouses?

54
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,670
Now, one of the most critical areas of
it is the number of layers involved.

55
00:03:42,105 --> 00:03:47,535
In today's warehouse, we have a system
that takes care of the inventory

56
00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:51,165
management, it takes care of all
the stock monitoring and all that.

57
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:54,435
We have a system that takes care
of transportation management.

58
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:55,304
We have a system.

59
00:03:55,575 --> 00:03:58,125
If there is a three PL involved,
we have a system that takes care

60
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:01,754
of three pl. We have system that
takes care of procurement, sales.

61
00:04:02,114 --> 00:04:06,244
There are all these different systems
and maintenance production, all these

62
00:04:06,244 --> 00:04:07,864
different systems that work together.

63
00:04:08,779 --> 00:04:13,579
They're all integrated to the warehouse
and they're all integrated and are part

64
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:16,069
of the overall supply chain process.

65
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:21,109
Now, when it comes to it, regular
proven methods that we have been

66
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:27,249
using so far where we have been doing
manual interventions to do picking

67
00:04:27,249 --> 00:04:32,649
optimizations, to do route planning, to
do demand forecasting, all of these have.

68
00:04:33,354 --> 00:04:39,684
Proven to fall short to cater to the
growing demand of today's consumers.

69
00:04:40,344 --> 00:04:45,474
So that's why where we are trying to
include AI driven optimizations, we are

70
00:04:45,474 --> 00:04:51,984
trying to bring in autonomous systems
robots that can pick we have automated

71
00:04:52,434 --> 00:04:57,854
storage and retrieval systems that can
go up and down, high racks reducing work.

72
00:04:58,584 --> 00:05:02,574
Work site incidents increasing safety
for workers who doesn't, who they don't

73
00:05:02,574 --> 00:05:06,324
have to go up all the way up to the
high rack area and pick it themselves.

74
00:05:06,324 --> 00:05:08,574
We have automated systems
for it these days.

75
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,764
Many companies are using it now.

76
00:05:11,304 --> 00:05:14,634
Some of the areas where we can
improve it is AI driven optimization.

77
00:05:15,144 --> 00:05:19,824
Where we can talk about how picking
algorithms can be optimized and

78
00:05:19,854 --> 00:05:23,574
made efficient, how route planning
can be done so that maximum

79
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:27,684
efficiency is obtained when planning
an order that is being shipped.

80
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:34,014
How demand forecasting can be done using
AI models where based on seasonal demand

81
00:05:34,074 --> 00:05:38,514
or based on any other types of demand
or low demand, how the procurement can

82
00:05:38,514 --> 00:05:43,344
be done, or how production practices
can be adjusted based on the demand and.

83
00:05:43,854 --> 00:05:48,064
We obviously talked about the autonomous
systems, robots and retrieval systems,

84
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:49,774
automated systems within the warehouse.

85
00:05:50,274 --> 00:05:53,724
And of course we still need the human
touch within the warehouse where there'll

86
00:05:53,724 --> 00:05:58,524
have to go through quality, we'll have
to go through exception handling or

87
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,594
that needs, still needs the human touch.

88
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:05,934
And also any task that requests judgment
still needs to go through the human touch.

89
00:06:05,984 --> 00:06:10,014
And then we also have predictive
maintenance where a lot of these sites

90
00:06:10,134 --> 00:06:14,904
do run 24 7 and we cannot always go into.

91
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:21,489
A breakdown maintenance rather than, we
should always plan ahead, see what type

92
00:06:21,489 --> 00:06:26,229
of maintenance these equipments might need
so that before something breaks down and

93
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:31,189
causes a production loss, we are always
ready to, do predictive maintenance,

94
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:34,189
preventive maintenance, and then make
sure that we are not having the downtime.

95
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:37,459
So that is also something
that can be achieved with

96
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:39,709
the sensors and integrations.

97
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,289
Now again, I did talk about
how traditional monitoring

98
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:45,214
falls short because.

99
00:06:45,714 --> 00:06:50,004
When we talk about traditional models,
it always involves a manual input.

100
00:06:50,004 --> 00:06:53,964
It always involves someone going into the
warehouse or someone going into one of

101
00:06:53,964 --> 00:06:57,954
these production facilities or maintenance
facilities, and then seeing how the

102
00:06:57,954 --> 00:07:00,684
machines are doing, how the components are
doing, how the equipments are doing, and

103
00:07:00,684 --> 00:07:06,654
then deciding if it requires a maintenance
or if one of these items needs more stock,

104
00:07:06,654 --> 00:07:10,564
or if one of these items needs, less
stock because the demand is not that much.

105
00:07:10,984 --> 00:07:14,494
It is all based on annual judgment and.

106
00:07:15,244 --> 00:07:16,564
In high volume warehouses.

107
00:07:16,564 --> 00:07:18,844
It is just a lot of data to go through.

108
00:07:19,294 --> 00:07:24,364
And also all of this is based on
just like I said, human judgment.

109
00:07:24,514 --> 00:07:29,934
So we do tend to miss subtle
changes that can happen, which.

110
00:07:30,434 --> 00:07:33,224
At that time might not be huge,
but then down the line, it can

111
00:07:33,224 --> 00:07:37,004
have a big impact in how we manage
and run the warehouse, right?

112
00:07:37,304 --> 00:07:43,634
So these models, if we train them and if
we have algorithms in place, it can catch

113
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:46,214
hold of these subtle changes early on.

114
00:07:46,544 --> 00:07:50,834
And then let us know if we have to make
those adjustments in our process so

115
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:55,364
that we are ready when those changes
in the demand comes, or when that

116
00:07:55,364 --> 00:07:57,914
change in the overall supply chain.

117
00:07:58,414 --> 00:08:02,434
Process comes in and when we have to
talk about, or when we have to go into

118
00:08:02,434 --> 00:08:07,754
the maintenance mode, when a certain
item requires a fix if these models

119
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:11,654
and sensors are able to give us that
information beforehand, we would be

120
00:08:11,654 --> 00:08:15,974
able to have that predictive maintenance
and reduce the overall downtime

121
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:18,254
and increase production throughput.

122
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,704
So that's where the traditional
models fall short, and that's where

123
00:08:20,704 --> 00:08:24,644
we'll be talking about using all
of these sensors and algorithms.

124
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:28,529
Which can help us run our Vs.

125
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:30,119
A much in a much more efficient manner.

126
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:30,784
That's what I'm talking about.

127
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:31,554
Okay.

128
00:08:32,454 --> 00:08:36,744
Now some of the core elements when you
want to implement such a model in the

129
00:08:36,744 --> 00:08:40,704
warehouse is first you need to identify
your service level indicator, right?

130
00:08:40,914 --> 00:08:44,964
You need to understand what you're
trying to achieve with this model.

131
00:08:45,364 --> 00:08:48,214
Do you want to do increase
your picking accuracy?

132
00:08:48,424 --> 00:08:51,604
Do you want to increase
your inventory accuracy?

133
00:08:51,634 --> 00:08:57,354
Do you want to increase or,
decrease the number of times you go?

134
00:08:57,969 --> 00:09:01,149
Go to pick an item and then find
out that the item is not there.

135
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:03,729
So that is something that
falls under inventory accuracy.

136
00:09:03,729 --> 00:09:07,239
Do you want to reduce the number
of such occurrences, right?

137
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:08,979
What is your service level indicator?

138
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:12,819
What is something that you're
trying to achieve with the system?

139
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:15,489
And then you need to have error budgets.

140
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:20,349
You need to have tolerances on how
much of certain thing is tolerable.

141
00:09:20,349 --> 00:09:22,359
You need to tell the system that.

142
00:09:22,859 --> 00:09:26,489
I can have up to 10% variance
or I can have up to 5% variance.

143
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:30,849
And then you need to also talk
about automated remediation.

144
00:09:30,939 --> 00:09:36,689
Where if say for example, you go to a
certain win in a warehouse, you try to

145
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:40,409
pick an item, and then you go there and
then realize the item is not there, but

146
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:42,989
the system tells you that the item is
there, but physically it's not there.

147
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:44,069
Now what happens?

148
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:46,169
You need to block the pen.

149
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:49,169
You need to tell the system
that something's going on.

150
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:52,559
The item is not there, but the system
keeps telling you that the item

151
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,109
is there, and then you need to go
into that exception handling mode.

152
00:09:55,589 --> 00:10:00,059
And then what happens after the exception
is raised, how it is handled, what kind

153
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:01,889
of investigation's done and all that.

154
00:10:02,609 --> 00:10:05,369
So we need to have that automated
remediation also built in.

155
00:10:05,869 --> 00:10:09,799
And then we need to also talk
about, observe the pipelines, right?

156
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:14,569
How we can observe the components
and machines and equipments

157
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:16,309
that are working in these sites.

158
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:20,089
How we can gather information from
those sensors and how we can make use

159
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:26,929
of that information to make sure we are
doing predictive maintenance right now.

160
00:10:27,904 --> 00:10:30,305
Let's talk about the sensors for a bit.

161
00:10:30,574 --> 00:10:32,464
Now we're talking about
IOT sensors, right?

162
00:10:32,494 --> 00:10:33,515
Internet of Things.

163
00:10:33,975 --> 00:10:36,795
We have various types of
sensors like mentioned here.

164
00:10:36,795 --> 00:10:39,885
We have temperature, motion, weight which.

165
00:10:40,185 --> 00:10:42,975
Monitors keeps monitoring these systems.

166
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,235
These, equipments these machines 24 7.

167
00:10:46,685 --> 00:10:51,335
And it has various aspects of monitoring
that it does and various indicators

168
00:10:51,335 --> 00:10:53,305
that it keeps giving us as an output.

169
00:10:53,815 --> 00:10:57,325
And if something changes based on
the change in the indicator, we

170
00:10:57,325 --> 00:11:03,085
would be able to determine if that
specific machine or piece of machine.

171
00:11:03,535 --> 00:11:06,595
Needs to go through any sort of
adjustment, needs to go through any sort

172
00:11:06,595 --> 00:11:08,665
of maintenance, any sort of replacement.

173
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,850
So by using this information beforehand,
and by having this update beforehand, you

174
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,640
would be able to fix it before it breaks.

175
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,710
So that's what we call
predictive maintenance, right?

176
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,910
And also preventive maintenance.

177
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,560
So if something breaks.

178
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,320
And then you try to go fix it.

179
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,030
You need parts for it, right?

180
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,590
You need to order parts for it.

181
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:33,010
You might not always have it in stock
to fix something, and then you need

182
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,270
to wait for the parts to come to you.

183
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,770
So that's gonna take time.

184
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,140
So that's why we talk about
predictive maintenance.

185
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,080
We are like, okay, I'm just going
to fix things before it breaks.

186
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,890
I'm just going to constantly monitor
it and then fix it before it breaks so

187
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,840
that I can avoid production downtime.

188
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,560
Because when a machine goes down,
when one of these components

189
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,990
go down these sites, which.

190
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,410
Sorry, which usually run 24 7.

191
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,990
One of these machines, you have to shut
it down until you get a replacement

192
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,950
component and until you can fix it,
the machine is going to be shut down.

193
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,729
That causes production loss and
based on what kind of industry you're

194
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:11,549
in, it can be a huge loss, right?

195
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:16,069
You cannot predict how long it
might take a component to be fixed.

196
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,349
There could be supply chain
disruption, so that's why.

197
00:12:19,235 --> 00:12:22,594
Predictive maintenance is an
important component of these

198
00:12:22,594 --> 00:12:24,454
high velocity sites, right?

199
00:12:24,935 --> 00:12:28,594
And based on the information
from these sensors, you can

200
00:12:28,594 --> 00:12:31,175
always train the algorithms.

201
00:12:31,175 --> 00:12:31,569
You can have.

202
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:37,249
Vast amounts of sensor data analyzed,
and it can keep telling you if

203
00:12:37,249 --> 00:12:39,409
something needs to be changed.

204
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:44,779
And then we can talk about the basic
KPIs that needs to be monitored.

205
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:49,589
How soon you're fulfilling your
orders, how soon you're picking, how

206
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:54,734
soon you're sending stuff outside
your warehouse from the time you got.

207
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:58,755
You received a customer order, by the
time somebody goes to your warehouse

208
00:12:58,755 --> 00:13:03,515
and picks it, and then by the time it
leaves your site, it's issued out and

209
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:05,215
then it's on the way to its customer.

210
00:13:05,215 --> 00:13:11,745
You can track these times to make sure
that you identify any bottlenecks in

211
00:13:11,745 --> 00:13:14,985
this process, and then make sure that
you're also optimizing the process so

212
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:20,655
that the overall customer satisfaction
is also improved and you don't have any.

213
00:13:21,295 --> 00:13:24,685
Holdups in your overall process
because something is not working

214
00:13:24,685 --> 00:13:25,705
the way it is supposed to.

215
00:13:26,115 --> 00:13:26,415
Alright.

216
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,095
And then digital twin.

217
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:32,265
So that's something that has been
that's being used widely in the supply

218
00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:37,075
chain area simply because when it
comes to supply chain management and

219
00:13:37,075 --> 00:13:42,355
warehouse management we have various
softwares that are being used to handle.

220
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:45,585
Activities, data, activities
within the warehouse.

221
00:13:46,195 --> 00:13:50,235
Again, just like I mentioned, we
talk about inventory handling,

222
00:13:50,685 --> 00:13:52,005
where all the inventory is stored.

223
00:13:52,005 --> 00:13:55,965
We talk about picking where you
pick stuff from your warehouse,

224
00:13:56,505 --> 00:13:57,735
shoot it to a customer order.

225
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,050
You do put away, you receive
stock from the vendor and you

226
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,130
sort it into the warehouse.

227
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,770
You do internal movements within
the warehouse, and then you talk

228
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:09,790
about inventory accuracy, where
you do go do cycle counts, right?

229
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:14,020
You count and make sure that your entire
warehouse, the stock levels are good.

230
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,340
It is as per what is there at
physically in the s is what is

231
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,430
being reported in the system, right?

232
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,020
You do all that now.

233
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:28,290
If you take a high velocity warehouse
where a lot of these activities are

234
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:33,750
happening on a day-to-day basis,
any implementation, any change that

235
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,290
you do, any new system that you try
to implement is going to cause a

236
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,820
disruption because it's just brand
new and the volume is too high, right?

237
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,140
And even when something changes
a pattern emerges, right?

238
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,500
Say for example.

239
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,990
There is a high demand for a specific
material, and then you certainly get a lot

240
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,390
of orders for it, or there is low demand.

241
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,150
Certainly the demand drops because
of, it could be various reasons.

242
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,490
It could be natural calamities,
or it could be a geopolitical

243
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,540
reasons, it could be anything.

244
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:09,650
So demand can raise or go down
and during those situations,

245
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,390
how your warehouse handles.

246
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:15,340
Those situations, how your
warehouse handles the volume is

247
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,640
something that you can only say
when you go through it, right?

248
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,270
So that's when digital twin helps,
where you can create a digital twin,

249
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:27,520
a copy of your warehouse, and then
simulate these variations in the

250
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,270
business process and then see how
your current process is holding up.

251
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,835
Say for example, you can test just
like I said, you can test a high.

252
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:40,380
Demand scenario and see how your
warehouse, or how your current warehouse

253
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:46,910
set up, how your current system set
up is built, sorry, is able to cope

254
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,070
up with that kind of a demand, right?

255
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:54,390
So that is when stillton helps
in the overall simulation.

256
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,870
And then you can review the
results and then you can decide.

257
00:15:58,485 --> 00:16:03,805
Which areas in your process, which
areas in your system needs refinement to

258
00:16:03,835 --> 00:16:08,535
handle those changes Right now, that's a
replica, that's what I'm talking about.

259
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:12,635
Now let's talk about analytics
and predictive maintenance

260
00:16:12,635 --> 00:16:13,595
a little bit, right?

261
00:16:13,955 --> 00:16:16,600
So the first step is that
you need information.

262
00:16:17,255 --> 00:16:22,325
You need a lot of data to do the analysis
and then come up with predictive and

263
00:16:22,325 --> 00:16:23,675
predictive maintenance schedules.

264
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:25,945
So the first step is data collection.

265
00:16:26,155 --> 00:16:33,715
You need seasonal patterns to identify
when a material can be in demand and

266
00:16:33,745 --> 00:16:35,905
when a material can go out of demand.

267
00:16:36,325 --> 00:16:41,105
You need to think about the trends,
the growth trends and then you need

268
00:16:41,105 --> 00:16:44,855
to go to predictive models where
machine learning models will identify.

269
00:16:45,515 --> 00:16:50,255
Identify these capacity that in
which your warehouse is operating.

270
00:16:50,345 --> 00:16:55,540
Incorporate the data collected, run
simulations, and then tell you, this

271
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,930
is when you might go through a high
demand phase, and this is how your

272
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:02,350
warehouse is acute to handle the volume.

273
00:17:03,145 --> 00:17:05,155
High volume or less volume, right?

274
00:17:05,365 --> 00:17:07,195
How your warehouse is equipped to do that.

275
00:17:07,695 --> 00:17:14,005
And then you can also talk about automated
alerts and recommendations on how your

276
00:17:14,005 --> 00:17:18,895
infrastructure is currently holding up and
how your infrastructure might need some

277
00:17:18,895 --> 00:17:25,085
kind of a change to accommodate say an up
upcoming change that can be really big.

278
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,915
And if your virus is not ready.

279
00:17:27,395 --> 00:17:30,935
For that kind of a scenario, then
these models can let you know, and

280
00:17:30,935 --> 00:17:32,105
then you can make those changes.

281
00:17:32,605 --> 00:17:39,495
Now talking about these automated
systems, we need it, it goes through

282
00:17:39,555 --> 00:17:41,475
several steps through the process, right?

283
00:17:41,505 --> 00:17:42,795
So the first is detection.

284
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:45,765
We need to know what, when, right?

285
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:50,675
And then the diagnosis, why the
remediation, what happens next?

286
00:17:50,675 --> 00:17:51,755
And then the verification.

287
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:53,495
What was done to fix it?

288
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:54,965
Did it really solve the problem?

289
00:17:55,145 --> 00:17:57,545
So the first step in the
process is detection.

290
00:17:58,055 --> 00:18:04,205
Now, in that step is when you monitor
the system and then you try to identify

291
00:18:04,325 --> 00:18:06,635
if there is a failure or if there is.

292
00:18:07,135 --> 00:18:09,505
Degradation in the performance, right?

293
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,935
That's when you get into that
predictive maintenance mode.

294
00:18:12,205 --> 00:18:14,455
If it is a failure, it goes
to breakdown maintenance.

295
00:18:14,515 --> 00:18:19,015
If it is a performance degradation, then
we go into the predictive maintenance

296
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,535
model, and then we go to the diagnosis.

297
00:18:21,985 --> 00:18:27,955
Now, based on the information detected,
we go and check and analyze the

298
00:18:27,955 --> 00:18:31,945
data and then decide if it's going
to be a breakdown maintenance, or

299
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,415
if it's going to be a productive.

300
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:37,520
Preventive maintenance makes it that
the production is not interrupted.

301
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,580
And then we see what
kind of an issue it is.

302
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,800
Is it a component health issue?

303
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,540
Is it a connectivity issue?

304
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,160
Is it data inconsistency?

305
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,390
Is it a volume issue?

306
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,900
Is it a process issue and all that.

307
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,820
And then we talk about remediation.

308
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,195
We talk about.

309
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:57,030
Steps that we can take to make sure that
whatever anomaly that was just detected,

310
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:00,510
whatever issue that was just detected, is
not going to cause harm for the business.

311
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,220
Not going to cause production
outages and cause revenue loss.

312
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:10,360
Now we can talk about a bunch of
self-healing or automated responses

313
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,470
to these anomalies now in here.

314
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:15,240
Sorry.

315
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:20,560
Now in here when these items, or
when these anomalies occur, there

316
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,279
are certain steps that the system
itself can take just to make sure

317
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:29,649
that, that situation is averted,
but that can not always be the case.

318
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:33,730
So we should also build that human
factor into it so that there is

319
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:38,199
someone who is always overseeing these
actions and making sure that, there

320
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:39,939
is a human judgment factor to it.

321
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:45,225
Just to ensure that whatever action
is being taken is the right course

322
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,905
of action for that situation, right?

323
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,735
So that comes into the verification model.

324
00:19:49,245 --> 00:19:52,335
Just because you throw a bunch of
resources at a problem doesn't mean that

325
00:19:52,335 --> 00:19:53,805
the problem is getting resolved, right?

326
00:19:53,805 --> 00:19:57,255
You need to make sure that you throw the
right resources at the problem so that

327
00:19:57,255 --> 00:20:02,235
the problem is resolved, and then that it
is also a permanent fix to the solution

328
00:20:02,445 --> 00:20:04,005
and it's not ha going to happen again.

329
00:20:04,115 --> 00:20:07,905
And then we also have some best practices
that we can follow when you're going

330
00:20:07,905 --> 00:20:11,264
to implement a new system or when
you're going to implement a change

331
00:20:11,624 --> 00:20:13,155
in one of these high volume sites.

332
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:16,544
So what you can do is always
make sure that any change

333
00:20:16,604 --> 00:20:17,874
that you do version control.

334
00:20:17,904 --> 00:20:19,465
So if something is breaking.

335
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,339
Something is not working right.

336
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:24,819
With the new version, you can always
revert back to the older version.

337
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:28,309
And then you should always do
multiple rounds of testing, be

338
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:31,699
it unit tests, integration tests,
user acceptance tests, right?

339
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:33,969
Load test, performance test.

340
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:37,959
All sorts of testing needs
to be performed when you're

341
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:40,359
implementing a new warehouse system.

342
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:44,449
And then the type of implementation
that is being done is also.

343
00:20:44,499 --> 00:20:45,549
An important factor.

344
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:50,709
You don't do a massive implementation
of a big scale all in one go.

345
00:20:50,829 --> 00:20:53,959
You do incremental implementations.

346
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:58,139
You do incremental rollouts, making
sure that you do the first phase

347
00:20:58,139 --> 00:21:02,579
of it, you observe, see that it's
successful, and then you go to the next

348
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:05,789
phase of it, implement it, observe,
see that it is successful, and then

349
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:06,869
you go to the next phase, right?

350
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:08,099
You don't do all at once.

351
00:21:08,994 --> 00:21:12,924
If something fails, you don't want
the entire network within your

352
00:21:12,924 --> 00:21:16,884
organization to fail because your
implementation did not work out.

353
00:21:17,384 --> 00:21:22,664
And then you also don't want a lot of
downtime for your warehouses during

354
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:26,054
these system implementations and
during the system changes, right?

355
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:29,984
Because just like I said, all of
these high volume and high velocity

356
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,414
warehouses, a downturn means.

357
00:21:33,389 --> 00:21:36,269
It could mean millions
in lost revenue, right?

358
00:21:36,479 --> 00:21:39,899
So you cannot have, you cannot
afford to have that kind of downtime.

359
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:43,979
So whenever you do that, you need
to make sure that you're minimizing

360
00:21:43,979 --> 00:21:47,579
your downtime to the maximum extent
possible, and then making sure that

361
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:52,529
you're not disrupting live activities
within the warehouse and you're not

362
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:54,299
disrupting the supply chain activities.

363
00:21:54,554 --> 00:22:00,344
Now you need to, when we talk about
these automated systems where it can have

364
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:06,234
human ai collaboration and, these systems
suggesting changes, suggesting fixes.

365
00:22:06,624 --> 00:22:11,184
You should also talk about how if
something did not work, something

366
00:22:11,184 --> 00:22:14,334
that the system suggested, something
that these models suggested did not

367
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:16,884
work, how do you make sure that it.

368
00:22:17,229 --> 00:22:17,919
Is fixed.

369
00:22:17,949 --> 00:22:21,269
How do you make sure that, sorry, how
do you make sure that it is refined?

370
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,139
How do you make sure that it is
working in the next instance that

371
00:22:25,139 --> 00:22:26,279
something like this happens, right?

372
00:22:26,699 --> 00:22:32,459
You need to do an initial assessment on
what happened, why it failed, and what

373
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:34,769
was the impact of the failure, right?

374
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:36,419
That is the first thing
that you need to understand.

375
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:42,989
The second is you need to have a
manual workflow where somebody.

376
00:22:43,634 --> 00:22:46,914
From the warehouse or somebody from
the supply chain organization is

377
00:22:46,914 --> 00:22:50,664
able to go look at it and then see,
okay, some of our systems failed.

378
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:54,964
That should be a fail safe mechanism
that needs to be triggered.

379
00:22:54,964 --> 00:22:58,894
Now I need someone to go look at the
problem and then come up with a solution

380
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:02,824
for it because the system was not able
to come up with a solution for it, right?

381
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,104
And the root cause analysis.

382
00:23:05,604 --> 00:23:08,604
We need to find out from
where the problem was.

383
00:23:08,604 --> 00:23:13,964
Was it a problem in these models running
the analysis and giving us outputs?

384
00:23:14,384 --> 00:23:18,534
Was it a problem connecting these systems
to the warehouse management system?

385
00:23:18,894 --> 00:23:19,794
Or was it someone.

386
00:23:20,294 --> 00:23:25,904
Or in the warehouse or in the overall
supply chain model that, we have training

387
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:30,164
gaps, is not able to do their job the
way that they're supposed to do, right?

388
00:23:30,374 --> 00:23:33,674
So we need to find out where this
problem is coming from, and then we

389
00:23:33,674 --> 00:23:35,804
need to talk about system restoration.

390
00:23:36,614 --> 00:23:41,444
How if such a failure happens, the
system can be restored and brought back

391
00:23:42,104 --> 00:23:47,444
to an extent that it is functioning at
the same level as it was just before.

392
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:49,004
The breakdown, right?

393
00:23:49,544 --> 00:23:53,624
So we need to make sure we validate
the fix that was being applied.

394
00:23:54,044 --> 00:23:57,914
We need to make sure that we validate
the performance right after the fix.

395
00:23:58,484 --> 00:24:01,394
And then we monitor the situation.

396
00:24:01,484 --> 00:24:07,664
And then after we fix the identified
gaps, we gradually transition back into

397
00:24:07,664 --> 00:24:10,214
the automated operations model, right?

398
00:24:10,754 --> 00:24:15,044
And then we do a post incident
review where we try to understand.

399
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:20,849
The entirety of what happened,
why something did not work, what

400
00:24:20,849 --> 00:24:25,049
can be done to fix the scenario
if it happens again in the future.

401
00:24:25,449 --> 00:24:29,929
A lessons learned review that we
need to do so that we can prevent a

402
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:31,699
future recurrence of the same issue.

403
00:24:31,949 --> 00:24:34,879
Now let's talk a little bit
about actionable frameworks for

404
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:37,429
these platform teams right now.

405
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:41,839
We have just like I said supply
chain management needs production

406
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:43,279
grade frameworks, right?

407
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:48,529
That can help them have reliable
warehouses, scalable warehouses, and

408
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,479
scalable warehouse systems, right?

409
00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:53,239
So one of those items is SLO templates.

410
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:57,839
So we need to have ready to use service
level objectives so that I know it

411
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:59,759
is tailored for the s operations.

412
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:04,759
Observability architecture,
integrating IOT sensors integrating.

413
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:09,499
Temperature sensors, integrating weight
sensors, integrating it could be RPM

414
00:25:09,499 --> 00:25:15,199
sensors and getting back all their
information, analyzing that information,

415
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:19,040
and then coming up with suggestions on
if everything is good or if something

416
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,120
needs maintenance and all that.

417
00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:24,129
And then we have automation patterns that
we can talk about where we have workflows.

418
00:25:24,129 --> 00:25:26,759
If something happens,
what the system has to do.

419
00:25:27,224 --> 00:25:30,884
If something is still not right, if
it has to go through a man lower ride,

420
00:25:30,884 --> 00:25:35,054
if it has to go through an exception
handling process, if it needs to get

421
00:25:35,054 --> 00:25:39,734
somebody involved, and all of that control
mechanism that is built into the process.

422
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:45,394
And then let's, it's to talk about
how to build a production grade

423
00:25:45,394 --> 00:25:48,334
supply chain infrastructure right now.

424
00:25:48,574 --> 00:25:52,984
Like I said, supply chain is a critical
component of any business that is involved

425
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:55,974
in sending and receiving goods right now.

426
00:25:56,034 --> 00:26:01,434
By applying these site level engineering
principles to warehouse operations, these

427
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,594
platform teams can create predictable.

428
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:10,359
Self-healing automated fulfillment systems
that can scale with business demands.

429
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:14,379
Because again, it has all that
information to look at the forecast,

430
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,429
look at the demand forecast, and
make all those decisions, and

431
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:20,474
then we can ma make use of these
integrations to make sure that we have.

432
00:26:21,464 --> 00:26:27,914
We maintain high service levels, we adapt
and change to growing business needs.

433
00:26:28,034 --> 00:26:31,904
We always maintain higher customer
satisfaction, higher customer

434
00:26:31,904 --> 00:26:37,724
retainment, and make the overall
supply chain process efficient, right?

435
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:42,254
So that's where these practices come
into picture, and that's where the,

436
00:26:42,524 --> 00:26:48,224
these practices can help any supply
chain organization succeed and keep

437
00:26:48,224 --> 00:26:49,469
succeeding in what they're doing.

438
00:26:49,969 --> 00:26:51,979
That is everything that I
wanted to talk about today.

439
00:26:52,249 --> 00:26:53,959
Thank you so much for listening in.

440
00:26:54,589 --> 00:26:58,849
Again, if you have any questions, please
feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn.

441
00:26:59,419 --> 00:27:01,279
My name is Vishner Psad Krishna Kumar.

442
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:03,469
I hope you have a
wonderful rest of your day.

443
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:04,099
Thank you.
