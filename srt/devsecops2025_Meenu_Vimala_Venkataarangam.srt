1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,389
And thank you for
joining my session today.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,870
I'm Nina Emran, a program
manager at Three Code Solution.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,310
Over the last several years, I've been
leading the enterprise scale migration

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,390
initiative, which is modernizing
the data platform, automating

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,590
the transformation pipelines, and
enabling the DevOps principle into

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,540
a large transformation program.

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,760
So in today's talk, I'll walk you through
on how secured, automated, and scalable

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,259
migration frameworks are redefining
the modernization for enterprises.

9
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:34,904
So now we are going to see about the
evolution of enterprise migration.

10
00:00:35,404 --> 00:00:38,734
In the past, migrations were
simply a lift and shift.

11
00:00:39,245 --> 00:00:44,205
These were mostly physical to virtual
transitions which is like quick minimal

12
00:00:44,205 --> 00:00:47,085
transformations and not very strategical.

13
00:00:47,684 --> 00:00:52,184
But today, migration involves complex
multiple platform registration.

14
00:00:52,815 --> 00:00:57,675
We deal with hybrid ecosystems and
compliance constraints, and also the

15
00:00:57,675 --> 00:01:03,195
need for continuous security, which
also requires alignment across team.

16
00:01:03,844 --> 00:01:09,185
So going forward, the migration will
be fully automated and also becoming a

17
00:01:09,185 --> 00:01:11,375
repeatable and a strategical process.

18
00:01:11,854 --> 00:01:15,425
So it has to be driven by a
DevOps framework that delivers

19
00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:17,435
predictable outcomes at scale.

20
00:01:17,935 --> 00:01:21,830
So now we will see what are the
critical challenges that are currently

21
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,300
in place for the manual approaches
and how the automation overcomes it.

22
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:32,540
So traditional manual approaches have
lot of risk and inefficiencies, like long

23
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,340
timeline coordination, failures, security
gaps and challenges in compliance.

24
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,700
But in automation, the first strategy
itself is to change a game completely.

25
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:48,850
It accelerate the delivery, reduces human
error, validate the security early in the

26
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,640
cycle, and drives continuous compliance.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,500
So the key message here is the manual
migration methods simply can't keep up

28
00:01:56,505 --> 00:01:58,929
with the complexity of the modern systems.

29
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:02,669
See what are the migration
scope across the platforms.

30
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,509
So when we talk about enterprise
migration, the scope spams

31
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:08,279
across multiple platforms.

32
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,269
For example, the legacy system
like mainframe still carry the

33
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:17,219
mission critical workloads and other
example is the AWS cloud migration.

34
00:02:17,425 --> 00:02:21,565
Which introduce multiple account
governance, containerization,

35
00:02:21,594 --> 00:02:22,945
and modernization.

36
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:27,954
And the other two example highlighted here
are the Hadoop ecosystem, which requires

37
00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:30,625
replatforming towards cloud native system.

38
00:02:31,135 --> 00:02:35,124
And snowflake drives consolidation
and modern data warehousing.

39
00:02:35,694 --> 00:02:40,164
So this diversity is exactly
why automation and DevOps

40
00:02:40,224 --> 00:02:41,514
principles are essential.

41
00:02:41,964 --> 00:02:46,524
They bring consistency across all
these heterogeneous platform and make.

42
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:49,364
Use of it in an efficient way.

43
00:02:49,864 --> 00:02:52,679
Now to make a migration
predictable and scalable.

44
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:56,459
The enterprise depend on four
key automation components.

45
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,289
Number one is the discovery tool.

46
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:02,369
These reveals hidden dependencies
and architectural gaps.

47
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:04,889
Number two is the data
transformation engine.

48
00:03:05,654 --> 00:03:10,184
These automate schema, mapping,
cleansing, and conversion.

49
00:03:10,634 --> 00:03:12,794
Number three is the
workflow orchestration.

50
00:03:13,064 --> 00:03:16,874
This manages the sequencing
dependencies and coordination.

51
00:03:17,204 --> 00:03:21,074
At last is the automated testing,
which ensures accuracy and

52
00:03:21,074 --> 00:03:23,054
integrity across all the stages.

53
00:03:23,774 --> 00:03:27,794
This modeler set of capabilities
forms the backbone of any

54
00:03:27,794 --> 00:03:29,894
mature migration framework.

55
00:03:30,394 --> 00:03:34,599
So now we will see few of the
components in a more detailed manner.

56
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,519
Number one is the discovery.

57
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:38,229
So discovery is there.

58
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:42,329
Automation creates the biggest
early impact because the modern

59
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:47,549
discovery tools automatically map your
entire ecosystem, like application

60
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:52,059
data flows migrations, security
policies and performance baseline.

61
00:03:52,809 --> 00:03:56,109
So this is essential because
unknown dependencies are the

62
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:58,329
biggest cause of migration setbacks.

63
00:03:58,749 --> 00:04:03,219
So by bringing complete disability
upfront, we eliminate surprises

64
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:07,899
and also we can plan far more
accurately on the migration.

65
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:11,009
The next one is the
transformation at scale.

66
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:14,939
The transformation pipeline, we
can summarize into four stages.

67
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,499
Number one, extract.

68
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:20,959
We can do parallel extraction with
minimal impact on the source system.

69
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:26,209
Number two is the transformation like
automated schema, conversion cleansing,

70
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:27,979
and business rule transformation.

71
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:34,609
Number three is the validation, like real
time reconciliation to prevent data drift.

72
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:39,139
And number fourth one is the load,
like optimize loading strategies

73
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,999
with rollback capabilities.

74
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:44,449
So when we do all these
things within an automated.

75
00:04:44,914 --> 00:04:45,514
Fashion.

76
00:04:45,784 --> 00:04:51,484
These steps allow migrations to run in a
really reliable and repeatable fashion.

77
00:04:51,964 --> 00:04:55,974
And these are all can be done
regardless of the complexity.

78
00:04:56,474 --> 00:04:59,534
So the next component is
the workflow orchestration.

79
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:04,044
So orchestration is an engine that
keeps the migration moving smoothly.

80
00:05:04,674 --> 00:05:09,594
The workflow automation manages
dependencies, execute task in parallel,

81
00:05:09,594 --> 00:05:14,994
and also handles executions, and provides
a real time visibility into progress.

82
00:05:15,684 --> 00:05:20,154
Most importantly, it reduces
human errors and eliminates manual

83
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:25,224
hands-off, which are the two biggest
contributors to migration delays.

84
00:05:25,724 --> 00:05:29,494
So the next component is the security
and the compliance integration.

85
00:05:30,154 --> 00:05:34,474
So in modern migration, security
must be built in not blotted on.

86
00:05:34,984 --> 00:05:38,554
So security by design means
embedding, encryption, access

87
00:05:38,554 --> 00:05:42,424
control, and vulnerability scanning
directly into the pipeline.

88
00:05:43,024 --> 00:05:46,894
Number two is the continuous
compliance, which provides real

89
00:05:46,894 --> 00:05:51,244
time monitoring against standards
like SOC two, hipaa and GDPR.

90
00:05:51,874 --> 00:05:55,594
And number three is the validation
gates, which enforces security and

91
00:05:55,594 --> 00:06:00,274
compliance criteria at every stages
before the process can move forward.

92
00:06:00,784 --> 00:06:06,034
So this DevOps driven approach eliminates
last minute surprises and ensures that

93
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:07,954
the migration is secure end to end.

94
00:06:08,454 --> 00:06:11,109
Now we are done with all
the automation components.

95
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:13,719
Now we are going to discuss
about the forward looking trends.

96
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:16,799
Here's where the future of
migration automation is heading.

97
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:21,239
Number one is the AI driven planning,
where the mission learning will

98
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:25,859
analyze the historical data to
predict risk and optimize the plants.

99
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:31,439
Number two is the adaptive orchestration,
which is like the pipeline will auto

100
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,119
adjust based on the performance and
the live system behavior number.

101
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:39,599
Three is the zero downtime cutovers.

102
00:06:39,869 --> 00:06:43,709
Like more organizations will adopt
techniques like traffic routing

103
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:47,399
and real-time replication to
eliminate business disruption.

104
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:52,409
So these innovation will transform
migration from a risky initiative

105
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:55,469
into a seamless background operation.

106
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:59,479
Now we are going to see the real
world impacts, so enterprise

107
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:01,669
that adopt automation experience.

108
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:07,039
Major advantages number one, is the
faster completion, up to three times

109
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,319
faster than the manual migration.

110
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:14,719
Number two, lower risk, fewer data
integrity issues, and significantly

111
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:17,179
reduced security vulnerabilities.

112
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:23,154
Number three is the higher success rate
automation improves consistencies and

113
00:07:23,154 --> 00:07:25,854
reduce the risk of mid migration failures.

114
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:29,814
These outcomes are why more
organization are moving towards

115
00:07:29,814 --> 00:07:31,614
an automated migration model.

116
00:07:32,114 --> 00:07:34,484
So overall, the main motor risk.

117
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:37,224
Building a migration asset capabilities.

118
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:42,054
The shift we see today is moving
from project-based migrations

119
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:43,674
to platform-based migration.

120
00:07:44,244 --> 00:07:49,074
So by embedding automation into DevOps
pipeline, we built a reusable framework.

121
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:51,759
We capture knowledge and create playbooks.

122
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:56,979
We shorten the time to value for future
migration, and at last we create a

123
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:59,289
culture of continuous modernization.

124
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:06,129
So this transform migration from
a costly cyclical event into a

125
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:08,409
scalable business capabilities.

126
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:13,554
So overall, the key takeaways
on the automated migrations are,

127
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:15,414
number one, speed and scale.

128
00:08:15,914 --> 00:08:20,835
Automation, accelerate migration
even on the most complex ecosystem.

129
00:08:21,104 --> 00:08:23,474
Number two, the security first.

130
00:08:24,174 --> 00:08:28,765
The DevOps integration ensures security
and compliance throughout the lifecycle.

131
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,780
Number three is the
strategical capabilities.

132
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:38,050
Migration becomes a repeatable and a
competitive advantage, so organization

133
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:43,240
that embrace automation today are the
ones who are going to get ENT for a

134
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,910
continuous modernization tomorrow.

135
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:50,435
Thank you for your time and I'm
happy to take any questions or

136
00:08:50,435 --> 00:08:54,395
discuss further on any other aspects
on migration automation offline.

137
00:08:54,695 --> 00:08:54,965
Thank you.
