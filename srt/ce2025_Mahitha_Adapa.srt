1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,590
Good morning.

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,100
Good afternoon.

3
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,599
Good evening, everyone around the world.

4
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,600
My name is Mahita Adpa and I'm excited
to share insights on transforming

5
00:00:07,609 --> 00:00:10,849
healthcare crisis management
through event driven architecture.

6
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,320
Before we dive in, picture the scenario.

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,470
A major pandemic is spreading rapidly.

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,070
Hospitals are getting overwhelmed.

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,810
Emergency teams are desperately
trying to coordinate resources.

10
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,459
Every minute spent waiting for real
time data means potential lives at risk.

11
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,729
Today I'll show you how we are changing
this pattern completely by leveraging

12
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,580
Apache Kafka and Elastic Stack.

13
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:36,200
Before we go further, let's understand the
importance of real time data a bit more.

14
00:00:36,585 --> 00:00:41,644
Imagine you are a hospital administrator
facing a sudden surge in emergency cases.

15
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:45,155
You need to know how many beds are
available across your networks,

16
00:00:45,165 --> 00:00:49,565
where your ventilators are, and how
much your hospital is understaffed.

17
00:00:50,155 --> 00:00:54,374
With traditional software architecture
system, the data sits in silos

18
00:00:54,385 --> 00:00:56,344
separately in different departments.

19
00:00:56,775 --> 00:00:59,684
Updates are processed
in batches overnight.

20
00:01:00,134 --> 00:01:03,235
Reports take more than 24
hours to get generated.

21
00:01:03,635 --> 00:01:08,765
And by the time these reports reach the
decision makers, It's already outdated.

22
00:01:09,155 --> 00:01:13,155
Healthcare leaders struggle to make
decisions and coordinate resources

23
00:01:13,395 --> 00:01:15,085
with these outdated reports.

24
00:01:15,585 --> 00:01:20,535
In crisis situations, even hours of
delays means potential lives at risk.

25
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:25,425
Some hospitals get overwhelmed
while others have excess capacity.

26
00:01:25,854 --> 00:01:29,195
This real time data helps us
overcome these challenges.

27
00:01:29,624 --> 00:01:33,505
The cost of delays isn't just
operational, it means human life.

28
00:01:33,774 --> 00:01:37,304
Let's now talk about how we can
achieve this event driven architecture.

29
00:01:37,994 --> 00:01:40,824
We can break the architecture
into four key components,

30
00:01:40,945 --> 00:01:42,384
each playing a critical role.

31
00:01:43,154 --> 00:01:47,714
The first, we need to capture the data
in real time from multiple healthcare

32
00:01:47,714 --> 00:01:53,064
sources, like testing centers, IoT
devices, ICUs, and emergency departments.

33
00:01:53,474 --> 00:01:56,914
The data flows continuously
and every piece of information

34
00:01:56,914 --> 00:01:58,394
is available for processing.

35
00:01:59,145 --> 00:02:03,734
For example, if a patient is admitted
in ER, that information is available

36
00:02:03,744 --> 00:02:05,384
system wide in milliseconds.

37
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:09,744
This eliminates delays and provides
real time view for hospital capacity.

38
00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:14,005
Once the data is ingested, we need a
system that can process millions of

39
00:02:14,015 --> 00:02:16,285
updates per second without any bottleneck.

40
00:02:16,774 --> 00:02:18,704
This is where Apache Kafka comes in.

41
00:02:19,195 --> 00:02:23,315
Kafka processes millions of events
per second in sub millisecond latency.

42
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:28,914
This means every patient admitted, every
test results are available instantly.

43
00:02:29,745 --> 00:02:34,114
Instead of waiting for the data to be
processed in batches overnight, Kafka

44
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:38,454
ensures that healthcare administrators
and first responders get live

45
00:02:38,454 --> 00:02:40,625
updates as soon as the event occurs.

46
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:44,705
Processing this data is one thing,
but making sense of it is another.

47
00:02:45,025 --> 00:02:46,915
That's where Elastic Stack comes in.

48
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:52,285
Elastic Stack helps us detect trends
and analyze patient influx and even

49
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:54,055
predict the future resource rates.

50
00:02:54,515 --> 00:02:58,995
Let's say if a hospital is seeing a
sudden rise in emergency room admissions,

51
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,870
Elastic Stack can flag this trend in
real time, helping decision makers

52
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,200
anticipate shortages before they happen.

53
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,930
Finally, all the real time
data must be made actionable.

54
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:15,320
We provide live dashboards and instant
alerts to ensure decision makers can

55
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,420
access clear real time data insights.

56
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,420
If ventilator stock is dropping at a
critical level, the system automatically

57
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,680
alerts the administrator enabling them
to take immediate actions rather than

58
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,880
realizing the issue when it's too late.

59
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,390
By integrating all these four layers,
data ingestion, real time data

60
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:40,410
processing, AI driven analysis, and live
reporting, we are now building a fully

61
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,160
equipped event driven architecture.

62
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,210
Using historical real time data
and machine learning models, we can

63
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:51,605
forecast The supply and demand for
the next 48 to 72 hours in advance.

64
00:03:52,105 --> 00:03:55,795
If a hospital is nearing full
capacity, the system automatically

65
00:03:55,795 --> 00:04:00,875
triggers resource reallocation,
ensuring hospital staff and supplies

66
00:04:01,065 --> 00:04:02,835
are where they are needed the most.

67
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:07,435
Predictive analysis doesn't just
optimize medical supplies, it

68
00:04:07,475 --> 00:04:11,755
also ensures hospitals have the
right staff on duty at all times.

69
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:16,775
AI analyzes the patient admission
trend and adjusts nurses and doctors

70
00:04:16,885 --> 00:04:21,625
schedules proactively, reducing staff
burnout and improving patient care.

71
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:26,230
For If an emergency department is
experiencing 50 percent increase in

72
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,220
admission due to a sudden outbreak,
predictive models proactively

73
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,960
reroute the ambulance to avoid
overwhelming of a single facility.

74
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,960
This ensures patients are distributed
across multiple hospitals efficiently.

75
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,680
Instead of reacting to a problem
after it happens, hospitals are now

76
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:48,050
predicting and preventing the shortage
before they impact patients care.

77
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:54,550
Hospital administrators now receive real
time alerts and actionable recommendations

78
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,740
based on AI driven forecasts, allowing
them to prepare rather than panic.

79
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,430
Now let's talk about benefits of event
driven systems and how they can shape the

80
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,370
future of healthcare crisis management.

81
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,140
By moving from batch based processing
to real time data streaming, we

82
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,200
unlock three key advantages that
directly impact healthcare efficiency,

83
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,040
decision making, and resilience.

84
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:22,350
With event driven systems, hospitals
reduce resource allocation time by 85%,

85
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,120
enabling them to process more tests per
day without compromising on quality.

86
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,500
Imagine a testing facility
that manually updates patient

87
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,870
results at the end of the day.

88
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,970
Now, with real time streaming, these
results are immediately available

89
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,150
across the system, allowing the
staff to quickly direct resources

90
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,930
where they are needed the most.

91
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,780
In crisis scenario, every second counts.

92
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,320
The longer it takes to get the insights,
the higher the risk for the patient.

93
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:55,130
Real time analytics now empower
healthcare leaders to make critical

94
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,960
decisions within minutes, instead
of waiting for outdated reports.

95
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,090
Consider a hospital administrator
tracking ICU capacity.

96
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,900
Instead of relying on a static
spreadsheet, they now have live

97
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,660
dashboards that highlight available
beds and real time, helping them

98
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,420
to route patients instantly.

99
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,780
Finally, a system is only useful when
it can handle crisis level demand.

100
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,720
During Emergency Peaks, our event
driven architecture, successfully

101
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,830
scales 10x times without any
downtime, ensuring hospitals have

102
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,020
continuous access to data at all time.

103
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,670
Our platform has 99.

104
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:37,620
9 percent uptime, allowing
resource teams to operate smoothly,

105
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,630
even under extreme pressure.

106
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,020
This level of scalability and resilience
is critical for modern healthcare systems.

107
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,990
Now that we understand the power
of real time resource allocations,

108
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,830
let's talk about the key factors that
make event driven architecture work

109
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:57,520
seamlessly in healthcare, i. e. data
integrity, security, and scalability.

110
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,410
Hospital labs and emergency response
teams generate massive amounts of data,

111
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:08,110
but if this doesn't communicate with each
other, we end up data in silos, which

112
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,230
slow down the decision making process.

113
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,580
Standardizing data formats are
crucial for real time processing.

114
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:20,170
Fast healthcare interoperability
resources and HLR protocols help unify

115
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,930
data streams across different platforms.

116
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,910
Imagine an ambulance is transporting
a patient with critical condition.

117
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,250
If a hospital system is integrated
seamlessly with the parametric reports,

118
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,380
doctors can prepare for the treatment
even before the patient arrives.

119
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,800
With the real time data comes a
lot of challenges of security.

120
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:44,530
Healthcare data is highly sensitive
and any breach can lead to compliance

121
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,790
violation and loss of patient trust.

122
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,250
Implementing end to end encryption and
role based access control, continuous

123
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:58,625
monitoring ensures Integrity while
allowing seamless information exchange.

124
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:03,475
We use TLS encryption and block
based access control logs to ensure

125
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:07,155
that only authorized persons can
access critical healthcare data,

126
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:12,495
ensuring privacy and compliance with
regulations like HIPAA and GDPR.

127
00:08:12,995 --> 00:08:16,365
Scalability is the last
and most crucial part.

128
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,380
A well architected, event driven
system must scale dynamically to

129
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,750
handle a sudden influx without
any performance degradation.

130
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,680
Our system leverages auto scaling
Kubernetes clusters with serverless

131
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:34,510
computing to manage sudden spikes,
ensuring hospitals don't face any IT

132
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,630
failures when the patient load increases.

133
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,110
Now let's discuss how we can build
resilient emergency response systems

134
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,260
that go beyond real time data processing.

135
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,110
In healthcare crisis, resilience
is not just about uptime.

136
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,640
It's about ensuring the right
information reaches the right

137
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,990
person at the right time.

138
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,840
Resilient systems should be
scalable, intelligent, and intuitive

139
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,670
to handle unpredictable events.

140
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,510
Now let's talk about the
four pillars together.

141
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:05,720
First, we need a system that integrates
data from hospitals, emergency responders,

142
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,610
public health agencies, To a single
real time viewer, without integration,

143
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:14,790
the response team are left making
decisions with incomplete information.

144
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,960
During an outbreak, if a hospital
and a testing team center operate

145
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,150
in silos, resource planning is
inefficient by communicating

146
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,120
electronic health data records.

147
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,280
Emergency call systems and lab reports.

148
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,890
We ensure comprehensive situational
awareness, helping decision

149
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,680
makers to see the full picture.

150
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,920
Speed is critical.

151
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:38,830
We configure message queues and
event streamings to handle over

152
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,460
millions of events per second.

153
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,110
Ensuring updates are processed
in sub millisecond latency.

154
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,540
Imagine a hospital is sending.

155
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:50,985
Critical ICU bed availability
updates with event driven systems.

156
00:09:51,495 --> 00:09:55,995
This information propagates instantly,
allowing ambulance team to read

157
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:59,995
out patient in real time instead
of relying on outdated estimates.

158
00:10:00,495 --> 00:10:05,520
We integrate AI driven predictive
analysis To anticipate demand for

159
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,130
next 48 to 72 hours in advance.

160
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,390
Instead of reacting, we enable
proactive resource planning.

161
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,039
Using past crisis data, our models can
predict where the next shortage may occur.

162
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:23,480
can happen, whether it is ventilators,
PPEs, medical staff shortage, allowing

163
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,550
hospitals to take preemptive actions.

164
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,880
Finally, making information accessible.

165
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,759
We built real time dashboards that
alert healthcare teams to critical

166
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:36,919
changes, allowing them to take informed
decisions in minutes instead of hours.

167
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:42,320
If an emergency room reaches a critical
occupancy level, an automatic alert is

168
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,840
notified to the administrator to redirect
non critical cases to nearby hospitals,

169
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:51,350
preventing system overload and ensuring
patient gets faster possible care.

170
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,730
Combining data integrity, event driven
streaming, AI forecast, and real

171
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:01,650
time visualization, we create a truly
resilient healthcare response system.

172
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,320
The future of healthcare is now about
anticipating what's coming next and

173
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,180
acting before it gets escalated.

174
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:11,155
Here are four major innovations
shaping the future of

175
00:11:11,165 --> 00:11:12,775
healthcare crisis management.

176
00:11:13,265 --> 00:11:15,955
First one is the advanced
early warning systems.

177
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:20,185
One of the biggest challenges in global
health is detecting the outbreak early

178
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:22,345
enough to prevent them from escalating.

179
00:11:22,854 --> 00:11:26,785
With AI powered monitoring systems,
we can analyze global health

180
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:31,515
data streams to predict disease
outbreak up to 14 days in advance.

181
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,985
This shifts from reactive to
proactive healthcare, which

182
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:36,125
can save countless lives.

183
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,165
The next one is the data
driven precision care.

184
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:43,155
Beyond outbreak detection, AI
is also personalizing treatments

185
00:11:43,155 --> 00:11:44,585
for better patient outcome.

186
00:11:45,235 --> 00:11:50,304
By analyzing individual patient's history,
their genetical profile, and the real

187
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:55,464
time health metrics, smart algorithms
can generate customized treatment

188
00:11:55,475 --> 00:11:58,915
plans to improve recovery rate by 40%.

189
00:11:59,475 --> 00:12:04,565
This level of precision was unimaginable
a decade ago, but today, it's a reality.

190
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,740
The third one is the
integrated emergency response.

191
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,760
A unified digital platform can now
connect hospital, labs, and emergency

192
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,740
teams in real time, reducing the
emergency response time by 60 percent.

193
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:24,635
Crisis management is truly effective when
hospitals Emergency responders and public

194
00:12:24,635 --> 00:12:27,545
health agencies work together seamlessly.

195
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:30,305
Picture a hurricane hitting a major city.

196
00:12:30,405 --> 00:12:36,085
Instead of hospitals working in silos,
an integrated response system allows real

197
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:41,325
time coordination, directing the ambulance
to available hospitals instantly.

198
00:12:41,604 --> 00:12:45,248
This ensures no single hospital
is getting overwhelmed while

199
00:12:45,248 --> 00:12:46,509
others remain unutilized.

200
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:51,090
Together, these advancements
are transforming crisis, giving

201
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:54,300
us faster, smarter, and more
connected healthcare systems.

202
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:58,070
We have covered a lot today from
challenges of outdated batch

203
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,220
processing to transforming to
powerful event driven systems.

204
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,160
Let's quickly summarize the three
major takeaways from this discussion.

205
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,330
Event driven architecture.

206
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:11,199
Traditional batch processing
causes delays that may cost life.

207
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,329
With event driven architecture,
we achieve sub millisecond data

208
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,000
processing with 10x scalability.

209
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,460
Ensuring critical health care insight
reaches decision makers in real time.

210
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,900
Instead of hospitals waiting for hours
for outdated reports to get generated,

211
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,919
the decision makers and the administrators
have live dashboards where they can take

212
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,590
a peek and decide for the next steps.

213
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,790
Data alone isn't enough.

214
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,350
We needed to make it actionable
by using predictive models.

215
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:45,077
We can forecast resource demands
up to 48 to 72 hours in advance

216
00:13:45,077 --> 00:13:47,299
with 90 percent accuracy.

217
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:52,229
This means that instead of running out
of ventilators during crisis, hospitals

218
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:55,949
can proactively allocate and distribute
supplies before the shortage occurs.

219
00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:59,629
The last one, and very
important, is the resiliency.

220
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:03,379
No system is effective if
it fails during high demand.

221
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:07,019
Our architecture ensures 99.

222
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:12,379
9 percent uptime even under extreme
surge, processing 100k events per

223
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,449
second without any disruption.

224
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,469
Let's discuss what are the next steps.

225
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:21,319
Here are three key steps that
organizations should take to move forward.

226
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:26,549
First is to access existing crisis
management system and identify areas

227
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:29,009
where delays and inefficiencies occur.

228
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:34,169
For instance, if hospital is still relying
on batch updates, it needs to move and

229
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:37,089
start using real time streaming systems.

230
00:14:37,454 --> 00:14:41,614
To reduce the bottleneck and
improve response time next

231
00:14:41,884 --> 00:14:46,244
to use a I driven analysis to
enable real time decision making.

232
00:14:47,024 --> 00:14:51,334
Finally, scaling up resilient
infrastructure is a key system

233
00:14:51,344 --> 00:14:55,624
must handle high data loads
without failure during peak crisis.

234
00:14:56,014 --> 00:14:59,684
Hospitals cannot afford downtime
during pandemics is scalable.

235
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:03,299
Always on system is critical
for crisis management.

236
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:07,249
The transition to event driven
architecture in healthcare isn't

237
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:11,249
just a technology upgrade, it
is a fundamental shift on how we

238
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,169
respond to crisis and save lives.

239
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,119
As we move forward, adapting to this
approach will not only strengthen

240
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,154
our ability to handle pandemics
and health emergencies, But it will

241
00:15:22,164 --> 00:15:27,174
also create more accessible and data
driven healthcare system to everyone.

242
00:15:28,064 --> 00:15:31,744
We have technology, data, and
ability to make healthcare faster,

243
00:15:31,744 --> 00:15:33,604
smarter, and more reliable.

244
00:15:34,064 --> 00:15:39,174
But it takes commitment from healthcare
leaders, policy makers, and technologists

245
00:15:39,434 --> 00:15:41,514
to implement these changes to scale.

246
00:15:42,504 --> 00:15:46,914
Let's build a healthcare that doesn't
just react to crisis, but anticipates and

247
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:49,134
prevents them to real time intelligence.

248
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:52,429
With that, I would like
to end my presentation.

249
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:55,579
Thank you everyone for listening in
and hope you have a wonderful day.
