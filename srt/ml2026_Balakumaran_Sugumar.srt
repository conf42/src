00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,280
Speaker 8: Hello everyone and
welcome to Con 42 Machine Learning.

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,290
And today in this session, we are
gonna explore the role of machine

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,090
learning in modern payment ecosystems.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,620
This is not a talk about any specific
algorithms or model architectures.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,100
And so we are gonna take a deeper look
at how machine learning is gonna fit

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,589
as a system in the current payment
ecosystem and the prospectus of how

7
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:24,970
it fits, why it matters, and how it's
transforming the modern payment ecosystem.

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,360
My goal is gonna be very clear a
practical understanding of how machine

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,950
learning enhances payment systems.

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,460
Where regardless of whether you're
an engineer, you're a product owner

11
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,300
an architect, or simply interested in
knowing about the future payment systems.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,760
Before we dive in let me introduce myself.

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,660
I'm Meyer.

14
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,190
I work in the financial industry.

15
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,040
With over 16 plus years of experience
in handling large scale payment systems

16
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,480
I spend more than a decade or more in
handling payment platforms and enterprise

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,100
architecture throughout this journey.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,475
I'll I'll be sharing my experiences
on the practical adoption of

19
00:00:56,505 --> 00:00:59,275
mission learning that we have
experience in production environment.

20
00:00:59,765 --> 00:01:02,795
What brings me to this conversation is
not just about the theoretical knowledge,

21
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:06,215
but real world experience that's
connecting the payment challenges along.

22
00:01:06,305 --> 00:01:11,245
The machine learning solutions I've seen
work and most importantly how machine

23
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:15,465
learning is truly adding a value to
the current payment solutions and how

24
00:01:15,465 --> 00:01:19,310
it's just not a high, the focus of this
session is to where the gap between

25
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:24,785
real payment challenges and applied
machine learning, and we'll be examining

26
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:28,155
how machine learning solutions are fit
fit into the current payment systems.

27
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,640
And the prospective of looking beyond
mathematics and statistics that are

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,750
involved in machine learning algorithms
and how machine learning capabilities

29
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,099
integrate into a broader payment landscape
and deliver a tangible business value.

30
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,129
So what essentially are
we gonna cover today?

31
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:47,339
So here as the agenda that we are gonna
cover today we will be understanding

32
00:01:47,339 --> 00:01:48,304
what is modern payment system.

33
00:01:48,954 --> 00:01:52,694
Whereas modern payment ecosystem it's
inherent complexities then we are

34
00:01:52,694 --> 00:01:55,774
gonna explore how machine learning
basically fits into the ecosystem, the

35
00:01:55,774 --> 00:02:00,714
specific touch points across different
payment life cycles and where machine

36
00:02:00,714 --> 00:02:02,304
learning makes a difference over there.

37
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:06,499
We'll also look at some of the real
world examples and the key areas like

38
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:10,094
merchant acquisition, transaction
processing operational decision makings.

39
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,429
These are not just hypothetical
situations or scenarios.

40
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:15,659
They're based on the actual
implementation that we have

41
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:16,769
seen in production environment.

42
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:20,059
Next, we'll discuss more on the
system level benefits of how machine

43
00:02:20,059 --> 00:02:24,049
learning algorithm works in terms of
scalability, automation, and how low

44
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:28,079
level latency decision making side being
handled by machine learning algorithms.

45
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:33,039
The capabilities are to enable payment
platforms to operate at scale speed with

46
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,509
accuracy, and that's required by modern.

47
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:36,729
As payment systems.

48
00:02:37,149 --> 00:02:39,829
Finally, we'll be looking ahead
in the future, like how machine

49
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,949
learning is evolving with
emerging payment technologies and

50
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:44,509
challenging customer expectations.

51
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:48,059
We'll also be touching on challenges
and considerations that come along

52
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:51,899
with machine learning algorithms in
terms of biases and how we are handling

53
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,439
in terms of the critical domain.

54
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:55,219
Expertise that mission learning brings.

55
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:58,729
Let's start by understanding what we
mean by the modern payment ecosystem.

56
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:02,479
When we talk about modern payment
ecosystem as of today, we're not

57
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,269
just talking about moving money
from one bank to another or 0.8 to

58
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:08,839
point B. We are dealing with much
more complex, interconnected systems

59
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:10,519
that span across multiple domains.

60
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:13,779
At a high level, we are going to have
much merchant acquisition, the process of

61
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:15,809
onboarding, underwriting new merchants.

62
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:18,729
And then we go ahead with the transaction
processing where payments and are

63
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:21,129
authorized and executed in real time.

64
00:03:21,529 --> 00:03:25,129
And then it comes with the, with its
own challenges of fraud detection system

65
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:28,979
that needs to be continuously assessed
with its risk and preventing fraud

66
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,174
fraudulent activity on a day-to-day basis.

67
00:03:31,714 --> 00:03:34,414
Settlement hand is the action movement
of the funds and reconciliation

68
00:03:34,474 --> 00:03:35,359
across the payment network.

69
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:39,679
Analytical brings business
intelligence to all stakeholders

70
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:44,569
and operation ensures that platforms
run smoothly, efficiently, reliably.

71
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:48,099
And moreover, it it builds the customer
trust on using the payment system.

72
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:50,349
Each of these domains
have its own challenges.

73
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:52,659
They bring more and
more interconnectivity.

74
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:57,614
A decision made in fraud direction
affects authorization rates.

75
00:03:57,734 --> 00:04:01,734
For example, if a bad decision
made by a fraud direction system.

76
00:04:02,044 --> 00:04:06,314
May in her or cause a bad experience for
customers using the payment platform.

77
00:04:06,734 --> 00:04:09,684
As well as the financial implications
for the financial institute.

78
00:04:10,104 --> 00:04:14,244
Insights from Analyticals also inform
us more on the acquisition strategies.

79
00:04:14,514 --> 00:04:17,634
Operational intelligence also
improves system reliability.

80
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:19,694
You are the key challenges
that we're seeing today.

81
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:23,879
The system must handle millions of
transaction in a very short, low latency,

82
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,289
like less than a hundred milliseconds.

83
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:29,119
High accuracy and continuous
adoption to evolving patterns.

84
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:33,769
Traditional rule-based approaches
simply cannot handle such complexities,

85
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:37,799
and that's where we see like machine
learning fits into this entire picture.

86
00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:39,804
Now let's understand why
machine learning match.

87
00:04:40,304 --> 00:04:44,404
Let's contrast the traditional approach
of machine learning enhanced approaches.

88
00:04:45,254 --> 00:04:48,974
In traditional payment systems, we
relied heavily on rule-based systems.

89
00:04:49,054 --> 00:04:50,194
With static threshold.

90
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:54,554
You would have rules like decline of
the transaction is over 5,000 for a

91
00:04:54,554 --> 00:04:59,204
new card or flag review if the velocity
exceeds 10 transactions per hour.

92
00:04:59,624 --> 00:05:02,774
These also created by domain
experts and updated periodically.

93
00:05:03,284 --> 00:05:05,444
Manual reviews and
interventions are very common.

94
00:05:05,594 --> 00:05:06,434
Humans would.

95
00:05:06,684 --> 00:05:10,474
Look at flag transactions
and make up parole decisions.

96
00:05:10,964 --> 00:05:12,854
Processing often happened in batches.

97
00:05:12,904 --> 00:05:15,324
We would run reports at the end
of the day to support issues.

98
00:05:15,694 --> 00:05:19,324
The systems were very reactive
to fraud patterns, meaning frauds

99
00:05:19,624 --> 00:05:23,034
often had the window of opportunity
before rules were updated.

100
00:05:23,534 --> 00:05:25,274
This was limited to personalization.

101
00:05:25,384 --> 00:05:28,094
Every customer with similar
characteristics got treated the

102
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,214
same way and perhaps more important.

103
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:32,819
These systems are very
slow to adapt to changes.

104
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:37,399
Updating rules require committee
meetings, testings and deployment cycles

105
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:42,179
and a full round of loan assign testing
and and exhaustive testing before

106
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:43,619
moves to the production environment.

107
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:47,539
Now, on contrast to this, with machine
learning enhanced capabilities instead

108
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:52,279
of statics, we have more adapt, adaptable
models that learn from continuous data.

109
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:55,619
The models are, can process hundreds
and thousands of transactions.

110
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,064
With low latency finding patterns
that humans would never spot.

111
00:06:00,054 --> 00:06:01,884
Decision making happens
automatically at scale.

112
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,504
Millions of decisions per day.

113
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:07,974
Each informed by the latest data
processing happens in real time streams.

114
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:10,284
There's no waiting for batch windows.

115
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:14,854
The system are predictive and
proactive identifying potential

116
00:06:14,854 --> 00:06:18,074
issues as they occur, and
personalization becomes possible.

117
00:06:18,374 --> 00:06:20,799
Each transaction is evaluat
in its own unique context.

118
00:06:21,609 --> 00:06:22,389
Who's the user?

119
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:23,319
What is his history?

120
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:25,519
What's the norm for them?

121
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:28,759
And the system continuously
improves itself, learning from

122
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,929
every transaction outcome.

123
00:06:30,429 --> 00:06:32,859
This is the fundamental shift
that machine learning enables in

124
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,319
current pay medical ecosystem.

125
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:38,059
That's moving from the Richard
manual processing and reactive

126
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:42,239
systems make it more adaptive and an
intelligent platform using machine.

127
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:45,599
Let's go with machine learning
across the different payment

128
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,789
cycles that we have on a basis.

129
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:51,649
Let's get more specific about how machine
learning fits in the payment lifecycle.

130
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:56,139
I want to see that machine learning isn't
just bolted on one part of the system.

131
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:58,254
It touches every stage
of the payment chain.

132
00:06:58,754 --> 00:07:01,984
Now starting with the first stage
is known as acquisition phase.

133
00:07:02,324 --> 00:07:05,024
Machine learning helps with the
risk scoring and KYC automation.

134
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:09,784
When a merchant applies to use payment
platform machine learning models can

135
00:07:09,844 --> 00:07:15,274
instantly access the risk profiles,
verify their identity and make preliminary

136
00:07:15,274 --> 00:07:18,734
decisions about approving and the
pricing information for the customer.

137
00:07:19,234 --> 00:07:22,535
Now, going for the next stage
of the payment lifecycle

138
00:07:22,565 --> 00:07:24,065
during the authorization phase.

139
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:29,300
The ML powers fraud direction at real
time and optimizes routing decisions.

140
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,460
Every transaction model.

141
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,380
A fraud risk decides whether the payment
network to be used and determines

142
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,215
whether to approve, decline, or step
up authentication In the pre-processing

143
00:07:42,215 --> 00:07:45,685
phase machine learning provides more of an
anomaly detection and a load production.

144
00:07:46,095 --> 00:07:46,335
It.

145
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,110
Spots, unusual patterns
in transaction flows.

146
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,600
Predict predicts more of a capacity
needs and helps in the system

147
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,960
performs settlement benefits from
machine learning through improved

148
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,270
reconciliation and cash flow forecasting.

149
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,610
Models can predict settlement times,
identify discrepancies early and

150
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:08,490
optimized liquidity management
and in operations machine learning

151
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,270
enables performance optimization
and intelligent alert alerting.

152
00:08:12,495 --> 00:08:15,165
Systems can predict where
infrastructure issues might occur

153
00:08:15,405 --> 00:08:18,665
and automatically adjust resources,
maintaining tools service quality.

154
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,905
Below the lifecycle stages.

155
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:25,855
We also have crosscutting machine learning
capabilities that enhances all the areas.

156
00:08:25,945 --> 00:08:29,755
Patternation helps and identifying trends
and transaction data across millions of

157
00:08:29,815 --> 00:08:34,115
events, risk assessment, as well as the
transaction risk in real time concerning

158
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:35,805
hundreds and several factors and.

159
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,260
Honestly, the predictive analytic
analytical future also has a kind

160
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,390
of a behavior and outcomes from
fraud likelihood to merchant success

161
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:52,125
rates and optimizes constantly
improving routing decisions, resource

162
00:08:52,405 --> 00:08:53,670
allocation and system performance.

163
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,820
The key insight here is mission
learning creates an intelligent layer.

164
00:08:57,155 --> 00:09:00,065
That runs through the entire
ecosystem, not just isolated

165
00:09:00,065 --> 00:09:01,115
buckets or functionality.

166
00:09:01,615 --> 00:09:04,405
Now let's move on to the first stage
of the payment ecosystem, which is

167
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:05,665
known as the merchant acquisition.

168
00:09:06,065 --> 00:09:09,295
Now let's look at some concrete
application examples starting

169
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:10,285
with the merchant acquisition.

170
00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:14,315
The challenge in traditional merchant
acquisition onboarding is significant.

171
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,310
The process is slow,
manual, and inconsistent.

172
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,710
Underwriters have to review
the application one by one.

173
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,980
Evaluating business documents, financial
statements, and the risk factors.

174
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:27,540
This can take up to days or weeks creating
frictions for merchants who want to start

175
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,330
accepting payments right away and quickly.

176
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:34,310
Decision quality vary based on
underwriter experiences and judgements.

177
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,700
They can be human biases, different
reviewers can have different perspective

178
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,805
and come up with different conclusions.

179
00:09:40,425 --> 00:09:44,105
On the same type of similar application,
and the process doesn't scale.

180
00:09:44,325 --> 00:09:47,160
You need to hire more and more
underwriters linear as the

181
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,510
application grows on the scale.

182
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,550
Now, how does mission learning factor?

183
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,330
Mission learning models can automatically
assess such merchant risk by analyzing

184
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,780
a comprehensive set of factors like the
business side, the category the financial

185
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:02,680
history of the merchant the credit scores,
ownership information transformation

186
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,150
pattern for the similar merchant.

187
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,220
And also some extra source of
data that we can get from online

188
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,290
reviews or from public records.

189
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,770
And these exhaustive testings or
exhaustive record collections cannot

190
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:18,140
be manually assessed by a human which
is going to be a cumbersome task for

191
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,920
them and might take days or weeks to
collect information across different

192
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,220
sources that are available online.

193
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,850
The models have to be trained on
thousands and on thousands of previous

194
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,880
applications, learning which factor
correlate with the merchant success.

195
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,220
And which indicates elevated risk.

196
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,250
This can make instant decisions
for straightforward cases.

197
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,740
Lower risk merchants get
approved immediately.

198
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,090
High risk merchants can get dec declined
with clear reasoning and optimization.

199
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,960
Interesting cases probably the edge
cases where human judgment truly

200
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,060
adds value, gets routed to the
experience underwriter with the model

201
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,130
assessment and key factors highlighted.

202
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,930
This means a human expert, a manual loop.

203
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,390
Spend their time where it matters
the most, not on the routine.

204
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,050
Evaluation.

205
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,890
This bus this impacts the
business substantially.

206
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,360
We typically see around 90
percentage of reduction in processing

207
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,190
time for standard application.

208
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:13,620
Manual reviews decreased by 75 percentage
as most of our handle automatically.

209
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,150
And perhaps the most important
is that almost 40 percentage of

210
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,660
implement and risk direction.

211
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,180
The model catches problematic
merchants at scale.

212
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,840
That might have slipped through
the manual review, but it's not

213
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,160
just about speed and accuracy.

214
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,650
Machine learning enables consistent
decision making at scale, creating better

215
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:33,820
user experience for merchants while
maintaining appropriate risk controls.

216
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,525
Now let's move on to the transaction
processing life stage of payment

217
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:39,660
systems where the demands are.

218
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:45,300
Even more extreme I would say payment
authorization happens in milliseconds,

219
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,240
and it has to happen in milliseconds
to have a better customer experience.

220
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,800
When someone fights a car, for example,
or clicks by now, the system has to make a

221
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,330
decision within a few milliseconds whether
to approve or decline the transaction

222
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:02,210
within those tiny vendor, you need to make
a distinguish a legitimate transaction

223
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,970
whether it's a fraud without adding
friction to the customer experience.

224
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:11,440
Static rules create dilemma
and if it's not governed or

225
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,750
doesn't go to the review cycle.

226
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,650
And if it's too strict, you
decline legitimate purchases

227
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,700
and frustrate the customer.

228
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,200
If it's too lenient, you let fraud
through the system and lose money.

229
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,500
Either way, you are making business
trade offs on incomplete information.

230
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,290
And most of these manual transactions
or manual rule rules are exposed.

231
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,370
Easy to understand and easy
to break for middleman.

232
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,350
The challenge in intensifies because
fraud patterns constantly evolve.

233
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,070
What worked last month
might not work this month.

234
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,520
Fraud says, test the system in
and out, find the weaknesses,

235
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,970
and try to exploit them as much
as we can, as much as they can.

236
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,070
By the time you update the rules, they
have moved on to the next tactics.

237
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,960
Machine learning transforms this equation.

238
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,800
Real time mission models score every
transaction based on hundreds of features.

239
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,970
They look at device brands, your location
of the customer velocity patterns.

240
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,660
Is this the 10th
transaction for this card?

241
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,720
In the last few hours they consider
merchant categories, historical

242
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,690
behaviors, or even the time of the
day when the transaction was made.

243
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,960
The model continuously
runs from his feedback.

244
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:16,800
When the transaction is approved and later
reported as a fraud, the information flows

245
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,280
back to improve the future predictions.

246
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,480
And that's where the deep
learning model comes into play

247
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,740
for fraud direction system.

248
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,840
When a legitimate transaction has
been declined the customer calls to

249
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,360
verify that and teaches the model
that it's legitimate transaction and

250
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,620
should not be a fraud transaction.

251
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,170
So it back propagates all the
rules and decision making back

252
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:38,740
to the machine learning layers,
hidden layers in learning model.

253
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:43,795
And that's when this creates this makes a
system more smarter over a period of time.

254
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,200
And we will see le lesser and
more enhanced user experience

255
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,040
through less friction.

256
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,960
The result is a set of key
machine learning capabilities

257
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,860
in real time processing.

258
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,750
Actually the fraud scoring as assesses
the risk and less than a hundred

259
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,590
milliseconds providing a probability
score rather than a binary decision.

260
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,510
For example, if a fraud has been detected
and it falls within the category of.

261
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,375
0.5 to 0.7.

262
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:12,775
There needs to be an enhanced a customer
validation for this transaction.

263
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:17,025
And if it's beyond 0.7, it's a clear,
legitimate fraud transaction that

264
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:18,475
has happened which has to be tagged.

265
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:22,835
Routing such intelligent decisions
optimizes approval rates by selecting

266
00:14:22,835 --> 00:14:25,800
the best payment networks for
each of these transactions based

267
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,760
on the historical performance.

268
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,500
Anomaly detection, identification
unusual patterns are detected instantly.

269
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,840
Perhaps there are certain spikes
in the transaction for a particular

270
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,570
region or specific merchandising,
unusual card testing activity.

271
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,980
And dynamic threshold are just
rule based on the context.

272
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,580
What's normal for one merchant category
might be suspicious for other merchant.

273
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,170
All of this happens in real time
at scale with accuracy that exceeds

274
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:54,020
the rule-based systems that and
that is the power of machine

275
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,330
learning in transaction processing.

276
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,900
The third application the third
application area is the operational

277
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,990
decision making, which is often
less visible, but equally important.

278
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,360
Payment platforms generate massive
amounts of operational data system

279
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,560
metrics, performance indicators,
error rates, resource utilization.

280
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,180
The volume is overwhelming.

281
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,540
Human teams struggles to monitor
all of this at real time.

282
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,200
Spots emerging issues before they
impact the customer and make optimal

283
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,240
decisions about capacity and resource
Allocation approaches are very reactive.

284
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,890
You notice a problem after it affects
the customer and then scramble to fix it.

285
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,350
Are you over approaching the
resources to be safe wasting money

286
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,390
or having unutilized capacity?

287
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,450
Neither approach is optimal.

288
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:40,040
Machine learning enables the fundamental
enables of fundamental of different

289
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,140
models action of reacting to a problem.

290
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,640
Machine learning system predicts them.

291
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:48,030
The model learns from the normal pattern
of the system behavior and detects

292
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,890
anomalies that indicate potential issues.

293
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:55,040
They forecast traffic patterns based on
time of the day of the week, upcoming

294
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,390
events and the historical trends.

295
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,790
This enables proactive operation.

296
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,570
The system can scale up
capacity before a traffic spike.

297
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:07,410
It's, it can identify the performance
degradation before it causes outage.

298
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,720
It can optimize resources.

299
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,730
Allocates dynamically ensures
your capacity where you need

300
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,120
it without or provisioning.

301
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,300
That is.

302
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,110
System, let me give you a
specific operational use case.

303
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,740
Like for first the capacity
planning more machine learning

304
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,230
models forecast low patents and
trigger auto scaling decisions.

305
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,990
They optimize resource distribution
across infrastructure and also

306
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:32,060
ensure efficient utilization without
sacrificing the proper buffer.

307
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,220
The second is incident detection.

308
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,600
Anomaly detection algorithms,
spot issues in real time, and

309
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,070
generate intelligent alerts.

310
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:43,230
Like a root cause analysis model helps
teams to quickly identify what's wrong.

311
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:47,360
Some systems can even trigger automated
remediation process like resetting

312
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,715
fail services, rerouting traffic,
or even adjusting configurations.

313
00:16:51,535 --> 00:16:54,700
And the third one is about performance
tuning machine learning models.

314
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,340
Continuously to monitor latency.

315
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,620
Identify bottlenecks in the transaction
processing and suggest any and suggest

316
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,830
or automatically implement configurations
that can optimize the throughput and

317
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:08,465
response time for any transactions that
rely on the machine learning algorithms.

318
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,040
The result in payment platform is just not
about running the system but it is about

319
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,450
continuously improving its own operations
with minimal human intervention.

320
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,830
This not only announces the
customer capabilities of

321
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:21,835
using the payment platform.

322
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,820
But also has less friction of
humans getting involved in the

323
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,370
process of maintaining the system.

324
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,800
Now let's step back and look at the
system level benefits that machine

325
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:34,870
learning brings to the pay medical
system, these transient individual

326
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:39,770
applications and transform how the
entire platform operates First.

327
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,770
The scalability.

328
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,240
A machine learning machine learning
algorithms enables payment system

329
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,410
to handle millions of transactions
without linear cost increases.

330
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:52,430
Think about for a moment like
traditional systems have to scale

331
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,680
linearly twice a volume requires twice
infrastructure and twice the stuff.

332
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,720
Now, machine learning over here
breaks this pattern models that

333
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,200
have handled increased volume
without degradation in quality.

334
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,150
They quickly add up to
traffic spikes automatically.

335
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,220
Adjusting to processing priorities
and business allocation.

336
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,230
This enables global expansion without
the proportional clean growth.

337
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,960
You don't have to like constantly
keep hiring people just because

338
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,820
your traffic is linearly expanding.

339
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,800
You can enter into new markets, support
new payment methods, and handle growing

340
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,295
transaction volumes without hiring
an army of analysts and operators.

341
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,060
Mission learning algorithms are quite
capable of performing analytics,

342
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,940
analytical skills at scale and
give more insights and forecast

343
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,770
for the transaction that are
happening within the payment system.

344
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,330
Now moving forward, the second
one would be automation.

345
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:49,295
This is perhaps the most,
most tangible benefit I see.

346
00:18:49,385 --> 00:18:52,975
While using machine Eye, the machine
learning reduces manual intervention.

347
00:18:53,285 --> 00:18:58,965
From 50 percentage of cases in traditional
systems to less than five percentage,

348
00:18:59,265 --> 00:19:03,525
when you're using a machine learning
enhanced ecosystem, most decisions

349
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:08,545
like fraud checks risk assessments
routing choices happen automatically

350
00:19:08,795 --> 00:19:10,325
with high accuracy and at scale.

351
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:14,645
This frees human experts to focus
more on complex edge cases where

352
00:19:14,645 --> 00:19:16,265
judgment and creativity matters.

353
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,920
And this ensures this man in
the loop in the entire machine

354
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,630
learning models learning skills.

355
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:26,000
The payment analyst isn't just serving
hundreds of routine transactions

356
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:30,510
but they have been investigating
sophisticated thought drinks or making

357
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,600
strategic decisions about risk policies.

358
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,270
The platform operates 24 by seven.

359
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,365
You don't have someone just stepping
out because he needs to have dinner.

360
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,240
And this and the system is not
being monitored for a while.

361
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,020
So those kind of anomalies can be
avoided when you are using machine

362
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,140
learning at scale because it's
going to operate 24 by seven without

363
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,600
any without any human intercept.

364
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,250
And it still maintains a high quality
and appropriate risk controls.

365
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,820
Now the third one I would say is
more about low latency intelligence.

366
00:20:00,295 --> 00:20:02,415
Machine learning enables
real time decision making

367
00:20:02,415 --> 00:20:03,645
under a hundred milliseconds.

368
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:07,715
Even when processing complex feature
sets with hundreds of data points

369
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:10,915
the model maintains a high accuracy
throughput handling thousands of

370
00:20:10,915 --> 00:20:14,425
transactions per second without
compromising on decision quality.

371
00:20:15,205 --> 00:20:18,115
And that's the magic and power of
machine learning and payment systems.

372
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:22,165
This is critical in payment systems
when milliseconds really matter.

373
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,630
Because when you swipe a card at
a merchant location, you want the

374
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,740
transaction to happen quickly.

375
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,340
So every milliseconds of latency
will affect the customer experience

376
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,330
and the conversion rates.

377
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,320
Machine learning achieves this seamlessly.

378
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:38,220
And with sophisticated intelligence
and internet speed, these

379
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,070
three benefits the scalability,
automation, and low level latency.

380
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,520
Intelligence represents a
fundamental shift in what.

381
00:20:45,895 --> 00:20:47,655
It's possible with payment platform.

382
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:51,915
They enable business models and
customer experiences that were

383
00:20:51,915 --> 00:20:53,855
invisible with transaction approaches.

384
00:20:54,355 --> 00:20:56,415
And let's move on to the
mission learning ecosystem view.

385
00:20:57,045 --> 00:20:59,925
I'm gonna give you a conceptual
framework of thinking how machine

386
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,885
learning fits in the payment ecosystem.

387
00:21:02,305 --> 00:21:05,505
The second diagram shows shows mission
learning, not as a feature or an

388
00:21:05,505 --> 00:21:07,275
application, but as a foundational layer.

389
00:21:07,775 --> 00:21:11,165
At the bottom we have the data layer that
includes all the raw data transaction

390
00:21:11,165 --> 00:21:16,045
data, event streams, user behaviors,
system metrics and various other

391
00:21:16,045 --> 00:21:18,155
data points in the payment platform.

392
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:20,105
The data is incredibly rich.

393
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:23,885
Every transaction, every authorization
decision, every fraud report

394
00:21:23,885 --> 00:21:25,055
contributes to the learning process.

395
00:21:25,555 --> 00:21:29,275
About all that sits is the machine
learning intelligence layer.

396
00:21:29,725 --> 00:21:33,035
This is where the data becomes
more insight and insights

397
00:21:33,035 --> 00:21:34,415
become more of an action.

398
00:21:35,075 --> 00:21:38,405
The model processes incoming data
in real time, generates prediction

399
00:21:38,405 --> 00:21:43,115
and scores, identify patterns and
anomalies and ans automated decisions.

400
00:21:43,475 --> 00:21:46,925
This layer a central nervous
system for the payment ecosystem.

401
00:21:47,425 --> 00:21:50,175
Now the application layer sits on top
of the machine learning intelligence.

402
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,170
This includes all the visible payment
functions like payment processing, fraud

403
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:59,030
detection, and analytical dashboards,
operational tools API interactions ui.

404
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:02,130
And each of these application
leverages the machine learning

405
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,900
layer for their intelligence needs.

406
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:08,350
But the intelligence itself is centralized
and shared across all these different

407
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,790
functional and operational areas.

408
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:13,060
Finally at the top of the business
layer we have the merchants,

409
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,510
the customers, the partners who
interact with the payment platform.

410
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,900
They experience the benefits of machine
learning algorithm through faster

411
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:23,870
onboarding, smoother transactions, and
better fraud protection and more of a

412
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,570
personalized service using association
relation, using in machine learning.

413
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:30,720
The key insight here is that
machine learning intelligence

414
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,250
layer connects everything.

415
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,780
It transforms raw data into more
of an actionable intelligence.

416
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,200
That powers all the applications about.

417
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,320
It enables the applications to be
faster, smarter, and more adaptive

418
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,100
than they could be independently.

419
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,150
That virtual view helps
explain why machine learning

420
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,830
is transformative in payments.

421
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,430
It's not just about improving
individual features, it's creating a

422
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,590
new foundation that elevates the entire.

423
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,250
System.

424
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,180
Now let's go with the
challenges and consideration.

425
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:04,230
Of course, machine learning, eruption
in payment is sent without challenges.

426
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,040
Let me be clear about the
considerations and potion pitfalls

427
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,990
because understanding this is crucial
for any successful implementation.

428
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,080
First, the data quality and availability.

429
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:20,225
Machine learning models are only as
good as the data they are trained on.

430
00:23:21,165 --> 00:23:23,955
In payments you face
challenges like missing data.

431
00:23:24,385 --> 00:23:26,755
Not every transaction has
a complete information.

432
00:23:27,215 --> 00:23:28,625
Biased samples.

433
00:23:28,955 --> 00:23:32,825
Their training data might not represent
all the customer segments equally.

434
00:23:33,285 --> 00:23:38,225
The data quality issues like errors
or duplicates and inconsistencies that

435
00:23:38,225 --> 00:23:42,535
could undermine the model performance,
secondly, I would say the model

436
00:23:42,535 --> 00:23:45,705
explainability in financial services.

437
00:23:45,735 --> 00:23:51,825
You can't just deploy a black box
model and hope for the best regulatory

438
00:23:51,825 --> 00:23:54,005
requirements, demands transparency.

439
00:23:54,335 --> 00:23:57,545
You need to explain why a
merchant was declined or why a

440
00:23:57,545 --> 00:23:58,745
transaction was being flagged.

441
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:02,925
Business stakeholders need to
understand the trust and how

442
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,325
the model is making decisions.

443
00:24:05,015 --> 00:24:08,295
They require balanced model
sophistications with the.

444
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,750
Inter operat ability.

445
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,170
Now, the third is the
real time constraints.

446
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:16,480
Payment decisions happen in
milliseconds, which puts several

447
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,830
limit limitations on the model cap.

448
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:23,100
Capabilities and complexities You can't
run and sample of deep learning networks.

449
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,840
If it just take, if it takes two
minutes of more than more than five

450
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,305
minutes in making the computation.

451
00:24:28,805 --> 00:24:32,945
Models must be optimized for latency
without sacrificing accuracy.

452
00:24:33,525 --> 00:24:38,595
This means that using simpler faster
models or implementing sophisticated

453
00:24:38,595 --> 00:24:43,675
caching and pre computational strategies,
so that limits the machine learning

454
00:24:43,675 --> 00:24:49,235
capabilities if you are using at real time
where the latency is the utmost priority

455
00:24:49,235 --> 00:24:51,485
for having a better customer experience.

456
00:24:51,985 --> 00:24:53,895
Now fourth is about continuous monitoring.

457
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:55,945
This is often underestimated.

458
00:24:56,225 --> 00:24:59,035
And to be frank it's not once
you have de defined the model,

459
00:24:59,275 --> 00:25:02,585
develop the model you push into the
production and your job is done.

460
00:25:02,705 --> 00:25:04,435
It's and that does not stop over there.

461
00:25:05,185 --> 00:25:09,025
Fraud patents evolve daily
customer behavior shifts.

462
00:25:09,525 --> 00:25:12,495
And there are new and new
regulatory environments that change.

463
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:16,635
So concerning all these different
factors, a model that performs well

464
00:25:16,695 --> 00:25:20,505
today might not be performing or degrade.

465
00:25:20,555 --> 00:25:25,205
In the next quarter, you need to have a
robust monitoring to detect performance

466
00:25:25,205 --> 00:25:31,840
degradation automate restraining pipelines
to keep the models current and have many

467
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:37,270
or robust alerting systems to flag when
human intervention is absolutely needed.

468
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,820
Now fifth comes with the
integrational complexities.

469
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,050
Payment platforms are complex, often
involving legacy systems that weren't

470
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,220
designed for machine learning algorithms.

471
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,380
You need to integrate machine learning
systems with the existing infrastructure

472
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:55,870
and you have to maintain its backward
compatibility, meaning and we meaning for

473
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:58,840
example, if a mission learning model does
not work for us, a particular service.

474
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:02,620
It has to be refactored and should
have a fallback mechanism to the

475
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,060
traditional rule-based models.

476
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:09,565
And that basically puts a lot
of constraint when we are often

477
00:26:09,565 --> 00:26:12,935
involving legacy systems that
basically weren't designed to

478
00:26:12,935 --> 00:26:13,940
use mission learning algorithms.

479
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,970
You might need to integrate machine
learning systems with the existing

480
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:20,670
infrastructure and maintain backup
compatibility meet compliance

481
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:24,260
requirements, and also ensure a
fail safe operational environment.

482
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,820
This integration is often more
challenging than I would say.

483
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,540
Then building the model, the.

484
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,580
Finally.

485
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,640
When we take a, when we talk about
risk management addressing payment

486
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,740
systems have real financial impacts.

487
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:42,430
A bug in a fraud model could cost
millions and only aggressive risk

488
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,870
models could decline legitimate
customers and harm the revenue.

489
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:50,830
This demand this demand robust fallbacks
human human oversights for edge cases.

490
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:54,895
And careful validation for
deployments, the stakes are high

491
00:26:55,135 --> 00:26:57,835
and you need to balance innovation
with appropriate caution.

492
00:26:58,335 --> 00:27:03,835
The challenges are real but they
are not uhum consumable successful

493
00:27:04,005 --> 00:27:07,305
machine learning models adoption
is in payment system requests.

494
00:27:07,755 --> 00:27:11,355
Thoughtful consultation of these
factors, not just our technical

495
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,835
expertise in mission learning.

496
00:27:13,335 --> 00:27:15,135
What is the future of mission
learning and payments?

497
00:27:15,565 --> 00:27:19,545
Looking ahead where does
machine learning in payments?

498
00:27:19,585 --> 00:27:23,165
Heading to let me share some trends
that I believe will shape the next

499
00:27:23,195 --> 00:27:24,635
generation of payment ecosystem.

500
00:27:25,115 --> 00:27:27,035
First is the embedded financing.

501
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:32,435
We are seeing payment experiences across
embedded devices seamlessly that are

502
00:27:32,435 --> 00:27:34,385
getting used on a day-to-day application.

503
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:39,120
Like ride sharing, food delivery,
social media, gaming and so

504
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,360
many different industries.

505
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,820
Machine learning is what
makes this possible.

506
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,170
Enabling instant underwriting,
real time fraud detection, and

507
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,640
personalized payment options.

508
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:54,810
Within the derivative context, the payment
becomes invisible if handled intelligently

509
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,990
behind the scenes moving on forward.

510
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,075
The second option is real
time personalization.

511
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:04,390
We are moving more just beyond beyond
fitting one size payment experiences

512
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:08,960
towards and moving towards more of a
dynamic offering pricing and experiences

513
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,910
tailored to an individual user mission.

514
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:15,240
Learning enables this by understanding
the customer preferences predicting what

515
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:20,610
offers they will value and optimize the
payment experiences for commission while

516
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,500
maintaining the appropriate risk controls.

517
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,360
And with the advent of more and more
usage of agent AI we are seeing the

518
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,260
machine learning algorithm plays a
vital role in shaping the agent ai

519
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:37,580
experience where the users have more of a
personalization and do a better shopping

520
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,780
experience using agent TK framework.

521
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,590
Like for example, he may just say go
ahead and do the purchase in TX store.

522
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,450
And get me get me a video game concept.

523
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:51,900
So the agent AI has to make a intelligent
decision given that banks can have

524
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,960
more of a pri private level credit
cards or dual cards and it has to pick

525
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,830
up the right credit card, which is
going to give them more reward points.

526
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:03,110
Then he purchases on a TJX store online.

527
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,530
And the agent AI has to make,
intelligent decisions using machine

528
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:10,850
learning algorithms to pick up
the right credit card and do

529
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,185
the purchases behind the scenes.

530
00:29:12,685 --> 00:29:15,605
Now moving on the third will
be cross-border intelligence.

531
00:29:15,705 --> 00:29:19,365
As commas becomes more global,
payment platforms need to be

532
00:29:19,365 --> 00:29:23,235
more smarter routing transactions
across international networks.

533
00:29:23,545 --> 00:29:25,385
Dynamic concurrency optimization.

534
00:29:25,995 --> 00:29:29,005
And as well as automated
compliances with diverse regulatory

535
00:29:29,005 --> 00:29:30,935
environments across the globe.

536
00:29:31,435 --> 00:29:35,515
Mission learning helps to navigate these
complexities, making cross-border payments

537
00:29:35,545 --> 00:29:37,885
faster, cheaper, and more reliable.

538
00:29:38,365 --> 00:29:41,565
And one such example the banking
system that I'm working, we are

539
00:29:41,635 --> 00:29:45,645
now started using stable coins as
part of the cryptocurrency world.

540
00:29:46,005 --> 00:29:50,465
And we have infused into the emission
learning algorithms for for quicker.

541
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:54,700
Cheaper and more reliable way of
transferring money from one institute

542
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,320
to the other banking institute.

543
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,720
Now, the fourth point would
be alternative payments.

544
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,640
The payment landscape is
fragmented to be honest.

545
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,090
We have cryptocurrencies,
we have buy now, pay later.

546
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:10,980
We have digital wallets and new
methods we haven't imagined yet.

547
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,510
Like nfcs or push provisioning.

548
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,600
And there are different ways of payment
systems that are that are being proposed

549
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,750
as part of the imaging payment system
ecosystem Machine learning enables

550
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,835
payments platforms to up to these new
methods quickly with the right tools

551
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:31,560
assess the risk profiles, optimized
routing decisions, and provide a unified

552
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,280
experience across diverse payment.

553
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:37,700
Now the fifth one would be more
of an autonomous operation.

554
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,960
As we are moving towards self failing
systems that predict sand resolve issues

555
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,580
before they're impacting the customers.

556
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,350
Machine learning enables these
platforms to detect anomalies,

557
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,460
identify the root cause, implement the
fix automatically, and continuously

558
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,670
optimize their performance with
minimal human intervention.

559
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:55,950
These aren't.

560
00:30:56,265 --> 00:30:57,075
Science fiction.

561
00:30:57,325 --> 00:31:00,745
We are seeing early implementations
of all these capabilities as of today.

562
00:31:01,145 --> 00:31:06,155
The future of payment is more
intelligence, more adaptive, and have a

563
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:09,005
more seamless experience that we have now.

564
00:31:09,095 --> 00:31:10,830
And mission learning is the enabler.

565
00:31:11,765 --> 00:31:14,705
The key message here is that mission
learning is not just for improvement

566
00:31:14,765 --> 00:31:18,670
in payments, it's redefining what's
possible in the payment ecosystem.

567
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:23,750
It's enabling business models,
customer experiences, and operational

568
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,580
efficiencies that weren't visible before.

569
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,700
Now let's move on to the key takeaways.

570
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,810
To summarize the key
takeaways for the session.

571
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,450
First machine learning models
is the foundational layer

572
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,490
in modern payment ecosystem.

573
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,820
It's not just an add-on
feature going forward.

574
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:41,510
It's not something that you
bolt onto the existing system.

575
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,600
It is a new architecture
layer that transforms how a

576
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,430
entire ecosystem operates.

577
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:51,670
Second that will machine learning enhances
every stage of the payment lifecycle as

578
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:55,950
we are seeing right from the acquisition
to the settlement to the operations.

579
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:00,080
They're not part of just
the payment journey but.

580
00:32:00,735 --> 00:32:05,204
Machine learning touches every aspect
of the entire payment lifecycle.

581
00:32:05,704 --> 00:32:09,184
This comprehensive integration
is what makes it so powerful.

582
00:32:09,684 --> 00:32:13,054
The third is the system benefits
that we have seen in terms of

583
00:32:13,054 --> 00:32:16,884
scalability, automation, and low level
intelligence that are becoming that

584
00:32:16,884 --> 00:32:18,584
are transforming the payment industry.

585
00:32:19,014 --> 00:32:20,304
They aren't incremental improvements.

586
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:24,199
They represent the fundamental
shift in how payment platforms

587
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:25,789
can do and how they're operate.

588
00:32:26,289 --> 00:32:31,059
Now, the fourth one would be the success
that requires a thoughtful consideration

589
00:32:31,389 --> 00:32:35,739
of the data quality, explainability
integration, and the risk management.

590
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:39,459
Machine learning is powerful,
but it's not the magic one.

591
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:44,169
Successful implementation demands
attention to these practical challenges.

592
00:32:44,669 --> 00:32:48,449
Finally, we have seen that machine
learning enables platforms to evolve

593
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:51,989
along with emerging technologies
and customer expectations.

594
00:32:52,459 --> 00:32:55,039
It's not a destination,
but it's a journey.

595
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:59,529
Continuous learning, continuous implement,
continuous adaption to the changing

596
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:05,199
landscape makes the payment ecosystem
more reliable, more trustable and

597
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:06,579
seamless experience for the customer.

598
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:09,929
The payment industry is
undergoing a transformation and

599
00:33:09,929 --> 00:33:11,429
machine learning is part of it.

600
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:14,799
Whether you're building a payment
system, using them, or making

601
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,999
decisions about them, understanding
machine learning roles in the

602
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:21,479
ecosystem is essential for navigating
the transformation successfully.

603
00:33:21,979 --> 00:33:25,189
We move on to a quick demo
on, on the fraud ion system.

604
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:27,899
And here's a simple demo that
I have pro promised earlier.

605
00:33:28,169 --> 00:33:30,869
So I have a docker that's
running on my local.

606
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:32,299
So I have Kafka that's running.

607
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:35,319
I've basically downloaded
from the public repository.

608
00:33:35,829 --> 00:33:36,879
It's running locally on my system.

609
00:33:37,209 --> 00:33:41,379
I have producer a stream
producer on my local and event

610
00:33:41,439 --> 00:33:42,739
consumer that I have written.

611
00:33:42,739 --> 00:33:44,839
It's a small Kafka program
that I have written.

612
00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:46,469
So basically this is the.

613
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:48,484
Model creation code.

614
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,174
It's a simple code.

615
00:33:49,284 --> 00:33:50,544
I'm synthesizing the data.

616
00:33:50,544 --> 00:33:53,194
I'm not using any real time
data synthesizing the data.

617
00:33:53,684 --> 00:33:57,794
So for a few of the data elements that I
have, if the amount is greater than 3000,

618
00:33:57,794 --> 00:33:59,479
and just adding the score as plus 3.5.

619
00:34:00,099 --> 00:34:03,219
And these are all like adding some
weight to the fraud transaction.

620
00:34:03,639 --> 00:34:07,179
And over here I'm returning it as
one of the score more than 60% each.

621
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:11,469
So if the cumulative data, if it's
the amount is greater than 3000 device

622
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:14,719
trust score is less than four 40 if
it's an international transaction and

623
00:34:14,749 --> 00:34:17,299
the fraud count is greater than two, so
they're all gonna add up to the score.

624
00:34:17,749 --> 00:34:20,059
So the score is more than six percentage.

625
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:21,679
I'm going to as one or zero.

626
00:34:21,799 --> 00:34:24,294
So this is how the model
gets trained and it.

627
00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:27,019
Packages sent into the PKL file.

628
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:30,539
You will see over here the p
file over here and what basically

629
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,224
so this is a. Generator.

630
00:34:32,534 --> 00:34:36,214
So I'm randomly generating data
on the fly like amount laying from

631
00:34:36,584 --> 00:34:41,054
$10,000 to sorry from one to $5,000
on transaction areas, randomized.

632
00:34:41,054 --> 00:34:42,464
All this data randomized.

633
00:34:42,464 --> 00:34:46,264
I'm randomly selecting the location
and what I'm basically doing is I am

634
00:34:46,264 --> 00:34:48,829
generat generating this transactions
and I'm sending it to a Kafka.

635
00:34:49,444 --> 00:34:49,924
Topic.

636
00:34:50,104 --> 00:34:55,604
So this is how I would send the data and
when I'm basically consuming the data

637
00:34:55,604 --> 00:35:00,364
from the Kafka stream I look at the I
predict the transaction and basically I

638
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:02,374
use the model that I had built before.

639
00:35:02,774 --> 00:35:05,539
You will see the model
has been loaded out here.

640
00:35:06,129 --> 00:35:08,369
And these are the features
that are there as part of that.

641
00:35:08,819 --> 00:35:11,819
And I'm using the model to
predict the transaction.

642
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:15,919
And if it is one basically if the
prediction is one, I'm saying like the

643
00:35:15,919 --> 00:35:20,129
transaction is a fraud transaction as it
goes through without identify as fraud.

644
00:35:20,499 --> 00:35:22,119
I go ahead, I stop the fraud.

645
00:35:22,824 --> 00:35:23,334
Transmitter.

646
00:35:23,394 --> 00:35:26,744
Basically it's just generating
the transactions and I will

647
00:35:26,744 --> 00:35:28,004
be consuming those events.

648
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:31,624
So if you look at the
consumer side so yep.

649
00:35:32,234 --> 00:35:35,579
If you look at the consumer side you'll
see that the data is getting consumed.

650
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,279
Not all the transactions
get track tracked as fraud.

651
00:35:39,549 --> 00:35:41,529
It is a combination of data.

652
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:43,029
And I'll probably pause this.

653
00:35:43,529 --> 00:35:45,119
So it is a combination of data.

654
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:47,499
So if you focus, if you look
at this particular transaction,

655
00:35:47,499 --> 00:35:48,909
the amount is better than 3000.

656
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:50,849
The device code is less than.

657
00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:55,709
And we, it's an international transaction,
so this gets tagged as a fraud and it

658
00:35:55,769 --> 00:35:58,129
basically identifies as a fraud election.

659
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:00,739
And this gets propagated
into the downstream system.

660
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:01,769
Very simple program.

661
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:03,769
The thank you for your attention.

662
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:06,959
I hope this session has given a
tier understanding of our machine

663
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:10,209
learning fits into the current
payment ecosystem and why it matters

664
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,309
for the future of digital payments.

665
00:36:12,709 --> 00:36:14,359
I'll be happy to take any questions.

666
00:36:14,419 --> 00:36:16,309
Feel free to reach out
to me in the LinkedIn.

667
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:18,299
You are that I've given in the slide.

668
00:36:18,749 --> 00:36:21,149
I will be more than happy
to answer any questions.

669
00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:25,519
Anything like specific to application
implementation challenges, technical

670
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:29,454
details where you want to see which
