00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,380
Hope you are all doing good.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:10,140
My name is Remar Gal. I have around
17 plus years of experience in it with

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,270
major focus on enterprise architecture
and designing distributed systems,

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,940
APIs and micro UI applications.

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,790
Today I'm going to talk to you about
revolutionizing healthcare with

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,960
enterprise architecture and discover
how enterprise architecture reshapes.

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,799
Healthcare digital
systems during this talk.

9
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:33,190
When you watch the video, please feel
free to connect with me in LinkedIn.

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,030
You can search for my name reh Kumar
Gal, and feel free to share your

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,560
questions or any discussion points, and
I'll be more than happy to talk to you.

12
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:47,680
I'll try to put in as much content as
I can with this presentation so that

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,390
you can use this knowledge in your
daily software development activities.

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,230
And then implement the same in
your full stack programming.

15
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,990
That being said let's jump on to the
talk the, or the first slide we'll

16
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,310
discuss about the core components
of modern healthcare infrastructure.

17
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,330
So modern healthcare infrastructure
is built on a foundation of advanced

18
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,610
knowledge that supports seamless.

19
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,200
Secure and efficient care delivery.

20
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,300
Three key components defined today's
healthcare infrastructure are the first

21
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,960
one being distributed systems wherein
healthcare organizations operate through

22
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,630
interconnected networks that link multiple
facilities like hospitals, clinics, labs.

23
00:01:33,185 --> 00:01:34,775
And specialist centers.

24
00:01:35,015 --> 00:01:40,055
So these distributed systems enable
real time sharing, enhance coordination

25
00:01:40,055 --> 00:01:44,065
among care teams, and support
collaboration collaborative care

26
00:01:44,065 --> 00:01:46,315
models that improve patient outcomes.

27
00:01:46,655 --> 00:01:49,354
On the second one being
the standardized APIs.

28
00:01:49,669 --> 00:01:53,779
So to ensure diverse healthcare
applications can work together

29
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,000
standardized APIs which is also
called as application programming

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,490
interfaces, serve as the common
language between different systems.

31
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:07,429
So these interfaces simply the integration
of electronic health records, also called

32
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:12,899
as EHRs lab Systems, pharmacy Systems,
and other digital health solutions.

33
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,789
They reduce operational silos
and make data exchange faster,

34
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:20,739
more accurate, and more secure.

35
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:23,869
And the third one is
the security measures.

36
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:29,169
With the growing volume of sensitive
health data, robust security is essential.

37
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:33,879
Modern healthcare infrastructure employs
advanced security measures including

38
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:36,304
data encryption, sh Texas controls.

39
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:38,669
And continuous system monitoring.

40
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:43,259
These safeguards protect patient
privacy, ensuring compliance with

41
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:48,559
regulations like HIPAA and build
trust between patients and providers.

42
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,839
On the next slide we are going to talk
about blockchains impact in healthcare.

43
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:59,049
Blockchain technology is replace
re reshaping healthcare by

44
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:00,879
bringing new levels of security.

45
00:03:01,234 --> 00:03:07,054
Transparency and efficiency to
how data is managed and shared.

46
00:03:07,394 --> 00:03:12,734
With enhanced security blockchains
immutable nature ensures that once

47
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:16,694
patient records are created, they
cannot be altered without detection.

48
00:03:17,774 --> 00:03:21,674
This dramatically strengthens data
integrity and protect sensitive

49
00:03:21,674 --> 00:03:26,834
health information from tampering
or unauthorized modifications.

50
00:03:27,284 --> 00:03:31,464
And blockchain technology also
supports improved data access.

51
00:03:31,674 --> 00:03:36,234
So with blockchain authorized healthcare
providers can gain real time access to

52
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:38,694
accurate and complete patient histories.

53
00:03:39,154 --> 00:03:42,844
This immediate availability of
records improves that decision

54
00:03:42,844 --> 00:03:47,764
making reduces re and testing and
supports better community care.

55
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:54,029
With blockchain we also see reduced
data breaches by using a distributed

56
00:03:54,029 --> 00:03:58,299
ledger Blockchain eliminates the
single point of failure, making it

57
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:00,549
far more difficult for cyber attacks.

58
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:05,744
To Compri compromise patient data
attackers would need to breach

59
00:04:05,744 --> 00:04:10,974
multiple nodes simultaneously which
is an almost impossible task, which

60
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:15,134
greatly reduces the risk of large
scale breaches in healthcare systems.

61
00:04:15,844 --> 00:04:21,364
Blockchain also enables smart contracts
that automatically enforce rules

62
00:04:21,364 --> 00:04:25,704
and agreements which can streamline
compliance with healthcare regulations

63
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:31,284
and accelerate processes like insurance
claims, reducing administrative burdens,

64
00:04:31,344 --> 00:04:34,065
and improving the patient experience.

65
00:04:35,685 --> 00:04:39,955
On the next slide, we'll talk
about FHIR standards and the

66
00:04:39,955 --> 00:04:42,205
interoperability solution.

67
00:04:42,485 --> 00:04:46,535
Modern healthcare relies on
fast, reliable access to patient

68
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:48,605
information across diverse systems.

69
00:04:48,845 --> 00:04:49,685
FHIR.

70
00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:54,045
Place a critical role by enabling
standardized data exchange.

71
00:04:54,325 --> 00:04:58,525
With FHIR, healthcare providers
can access real-time patient

72
00:04:58,525 --> 00:05:03,145
information across different
platforms, improving coordination and

73
00:05:03,145 --> 00:05:05,485
supporting better clinical decisions.

74
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:11,315
And we'll also talk about seamless
integration where FHIR bridges

75
00:05:11,315 --> 00:05:15,215
the gap between legacy systems and
modern healthcare applications.

76
00:05:15,485 --> 00:05:18,905
It allows older technologies to
integrate smoothly with newer

77
00:05:18,905 --> 00:05:23,585
tools, creating a more connected and
cohesive healthcare data environment.

78
00:05:23,925 --> 00:05:29,535
This integration helps reduce data silos
and enhances the continuity of care

79
00:05:29,535 --> 00:05:32,565
across different facilities and services.

80
00:05:33,895 --> 00:05:36,925
We will also talk about
developer friendly framework.

81
00:05:37,195 --> 00:05:40,225
Primarily built on
restful a p architecture.

82
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:44,665
FHR is designed to be an easy
for developers to implement.

83
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:49,555
Its simplicity accelerates the development
of compatible solutions, helping

84
00:05:49,555 --> 00:05:54,745
healthcare organizations quickly adopt
and scale new technologies without the

85
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,795
heavy lift of complex integrations.

86
00:05:58,505 --> 00:05:58,835
All right.

87
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:02,945
We will talk On the next slide,
we'll talk about cloud computing.

88
00:06:03,215 --> 00:06:05,665
Where scalability meets security.

89
00:06:06,235 --> 00:06:09,325
Cloud computing is transforming
healthcare it by providing

90
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:11,335
flexible, secure, and cost.

91
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,840
Solutions that that adapt
to evolving clinical needs.

92
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:20,740
So the first one being elastic resources
Cloud platforms allows healthcare

93
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,990
systems to dynamically scale during
periods of high demand computing

94
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,660
resources automatically expand our
contract based on patient volumes,

95
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:36,430
ensuring consistent system performance
and uninterrupted care delivery even

96
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,220
during unexpected surges and heavy loads.

97
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,410
And the second one is the
cost Optim optimization.

98
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,610
With consumption based billing
models, healthcare organizations

99
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,650
only pay for the resources they use.

100
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,610
This completely eliminates the need for
costly upfront infrastructure investments

101
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,315
and allow savings to be redirect
towards improving patient services

102
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,595
and advancing clinical innovation.

103
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:07,275
Another aspect of cloud
computing is the data protection.

104
00:07:07,585 --> 00:07:12,224
Patient data is safeguarded with
military grade encryption both during

105
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:17,705
transmission and while stored advanced
access controls ensures that only

106
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:21,185
authorized individuals can access
since due particular information.

107
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,610
Reinforcing trust and maintaining
compliance with healthcare regulations.

108
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,710
Another aspect is the disaster recovery.

109
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:35,140
Usually cloud-based geographically
distributed backups provide a robust

110
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:39,919
disaster recovery capabilities like in
the event of a regional outage, or in

111
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,839
the event of a natural disaster, critical
healthcare operations continue seamlessly.

112
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,659
Protecting patient care and
maintaining operational resilience.

113
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,950
Over the next slide we'll talk
about the enterprise architecture

114
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,380
implementation benefit.

115
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,395
It's implementing enterprise
architecture in healthcare organizations

116
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:04,525
delivers measurable improvements
across key operational areas.

117
00:08:04,815 --> 00:08:10,035
Like for example, the first one being
there is a 37% workflow improvement by

118
00:08:10,035 --> 00:08:12,865
integrating clinical systems seamlessly.

119
00:08:13,255 --> 00:08:16,715
Enterprise architecture
accelerates healthcare workflows

120
00:08:16,715 --> 00:08:19,055
faster and more efficient.

121
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:23,985
Okay, so that these clinical processes
lead to improved patient care and

122
00:08:23,985 --> 00:08:26,025
reduced administrative burdens.

123
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:29,975
We also see 54% enhancement in the system.

124
00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:33,555
Reliability all because of, again,
enterprise architecture frame

125
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:38,795
frameworks, which significantly boost
system uptime with major reduction

126
00:08:38,795 --> 00:08:40,475
in critical failures and downtime.

127
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,040
This ensures continuous
access to essential healthcare

128
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,810
applications and data.

129
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:52,630
We also observed 89% improvement in
data consistency through standardized

130
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,250
data models and governance.

131
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:59,110
Enterprise architecture dramatically and
enhances the accuracy and consistency

132
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:03,840
of information across distributed
healthcare networks thereby improving

133
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,390
clinical decision making and reporting.

134
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:13,615
So we also observed 42% cost reduction
overall with streamlined operations

135
00:09:13,615 --> 00:09:15,475
and reduced maintenance demands.

136
00:09:15,695 --> 00:09:19,505
Enterprise architecture drives
substantial reductions in operational

137
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:24,695
expenses, allowing organizations to
reallocate resources toward, in towards

138
00:09:24,695 --> 00:09:27,935
innovation and patient care initiatives.

139
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:33,335
Over the next slide, we'll talk
about user-centric interface design.

140
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:38,580
Designing healthcare technology with
the users in mind leads to greater

141
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:44,250
satisfaction, better, better outcomes,
and improved operational efficiency.

142
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,010
The first one being user satisfaction.

143
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:53,255
I. In T two, easy to navigate
interfaces that align with established

144
00:09:53,255 --> 00:09:56,945
clinical workflow workflows
minimize the learning curve.

145
00:09:57,185 --> 00:10:02,675
This reduces training time enhances
user adoption and BA and boosts overall

146
00:10:02,675 --> 00:10:04,865
productivity in clinical environment.

147
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,340
And the second one is cross
platform compatibility.

148
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:15,100
A consistent and seamless user experience
across workstations, tablets, and

149
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,050
mobile devices ensures that healthcare
providers can maintain community of

150
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,610
care anytime, anywhere regardless
of the device that they're using.

151
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,530
Another aspect is accessibility.

152
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,540
By embracing inclusive design principles,
modern healthcare applications

153
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,000
accommodate a wide range of user
needs, abilities, and preferences.

154
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,520
This commitment to accessibility
promotes equity and usability across

155
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,215
the entire healthcare ecosystem.

156
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,600
Another one is the security integration.

157
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,500
Security measures are thoughtfully
embedded with natural workflows,

158
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:57,520
ensuring strong protection of sensitive
data by integrating compliance

159
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,620
seamlessly into everyday actions.

160
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:04,510
Clinical efficiency is preserved
without compromising security standards.

161
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:11,110
Over the next slide we'll talk about
strategic phased implementation.

162
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:16,750
Of the enterprise architecture the
first one being the foundation where

163
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,860
the first phase focuses on building
a robust infrastructure supported by

164
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,810
comprehensive security frameworks.

165
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,260
The strong foundation ensures that
enterprise architecture can scale

166
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,460
reliably while protecting sensitive
healthcare data from evolving threat.

167
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,970
And the next one is integration.

168
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:40,440
A seamless integration connects previously
isolated systems using standardized

169
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,140
interfaces and interoperable protocols.

170
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,340
Disparate platforms are unified,
creating a connected ecosystem that

171
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,950
improves data flow and care coordination.

172
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,820
And the third one is optimization.

173
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:59,760
Typically after integration, most of
