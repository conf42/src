1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,230
Hi everybody.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,200
My name is Udi and I'll be talking about.

3
00:00:04,355 --> 00:00:08,055
The rise of generative AI in
marketing which has given rise to

4
00:00:08,055 --> 00:00:09,435
the term called vibe marketing.

5
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:11,205
So a quick intro about me.

6
00:00:11,265 --> 00:00:16,305
I have over 16 years of experience in
marketing, MarTech, and also go to market.

7
00:00:16,575 --> 00:00:21,025
So I'll be talking about the current
state of use of generative ai

8
00:00:21,305 --> 00:00:24,635
where it's going to go, and what
challenges you're likely to face.

9
00:00:24,905 --> 00:00:27,315
So with that we'll start
off with a presentation.

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,970
I think the first thing we need
to keep in mind is what does

11
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,380
the word vibe actually mean?

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,020
Because and honestly I don't really
like the term vibe because it tends to

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,040
give people the impression that you're
trying to match the vibe of your audience

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,480
and, that's what vibe marketing is.

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,930
That's I would say, 20% of what
the truth is, but actually.

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,980
The definition is much closer to
what the original definition of

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,480
Vibe was, which is Vibe Coding and
Andre Carti, which whom you would

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,390
know as one of the most prominent
figures in artificial intelligence.

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,970
I think he put it very
succinctly, is that.

20
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,950
If I'm building a project or a web
app, and it's not really coding, I just

21
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,090
see stuff, stay stuff, run stuff, and
copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.

22
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,050
What he's basically talking about
is prompting these large language

23
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:19,100
models to help you with the coding
and then putting down the code in

24
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,570
your wherever you wanna post it, and
then getting the output you need.

25
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,600
Vibe Marketing does share some of these
characteristics, but as you will see,

26
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,250
it's actually much more than that.

27
00:01:29,475 --> 00:01:32,775
Just to give an example, so
here's my vibe coded project,

28
00:01:32,775 --> 00:01:34,245
which I built over eight hours.

29
00:01:34,635 --> 00:01:38,025
It's just a fun little website
where you can go and click on all

30
00:01:38,025 --> 00:01:39,195
the places that you've been to.

31
00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:43,075
The reason I'm putting it up here
is to show that how accessible

32
00:01:43,075 --> 00:01:44,845
coding has become to people.

33
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:48,655
I do have a background in computer
science, but I haven't done any

34
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:50,215
programming for the last 15 years.

35
00:01:50,545 --> 00:01:52,355
And despite that gap.

36
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:56,230
I was able to come in speak to
chat, GPT, cursor wa windsurfer, et

37
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:01,669
cetera, and get a working product
out in less than eight hours.

38
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,930
Now applying this to marketing, I think
what vibe marketing is and there's no

39
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,530
clear industry definition, obviously,
but what I think it is giving.

40
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,019
Everybody and not just marketers.

41
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,420
The ability to interact with these
chat these large language models,

42
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,549
whether it's chat, GPT or Gemini
or, whichever you want to take.

43
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,959
And then cutting down
the time to market from.

44
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,000
Right from campaign planning all
the way to execution, iteration

45
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,489
reporting, and then re-op optimization.

46
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:37,819
So in that aspect it helps you,
first of all these tools help

47
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:40,989
you to understand what the what
personalization levels you will need.

48
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:42,744
For individual cohorts.

49
00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:44,784
And that's basically what the
vibe guidance is all about.

50
00:02:45,194 --> 00:02:48,264
And, and then that basically allows
you to create hyper-personalization

51
00:02:48,264 --> 00:02:52,194
so you can personalize content down
to the individual and not just groups.

52
00:02:52,804 --> 00:02:55,834
The second thing is it helps
you to rapidly scale up.

53
00:02:55,864 --> 00:03:01,324
Creating content, copies, images,
videos, rapidly, create post, start

54
00:03:01,324 --> 00:03:05,584
the campaign, observe the results,
iterate, and then optimize based on that.

55
00:03:05,744 --> 00:03:10,074
And also because you have a lot of social
media listening tools nowadays listening

56
00:03:10,074 --> 00:03:14,554
tools were a little bit difficult to
use in the past because the systems that

57
00:03:14,554 --> 00:03:19,934
used to take all the text, the kind of
feedback and review texts those were

58
00:03:19,964 --> 00:03:22,684
not fast enough to help you react fast.

59
00:03:23,014 --> 00:03:26,374
But of course, because of large language
models now you can literally throw.

60
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:30,469
All your reviews or comments from
your customers and then get the

61
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:33,469
necessary instructions to move to
the next step of your campaign.

62
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:37,609
So yeah, yes, vibe marketing does touch
upon the vibe aspect, but I think it's

63
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:38,989
a lot more than that as you can see.

64
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:44,499
I think before we move on to
what exactly is happening, I

65
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:45,819
think we need to understand that.

66
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:50,499
Marketing as a whole, or mar marketing
technology as a whole has gone

67
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:54,909
through a lot of evolution, starting
from moving to cloud-based services.

68
00:03:55,794 --> 00:04:00,004
Whether it's using Google ads or Facebook,
et cetera the advent of mobile which

69
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:04,384
allowed you additional creative space,
additional formats, it's additional

70
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:08,944
targeting options to go after to the
increase of social media where your

71
00:04:08,994 --> 00:04:12,804
PII data comes into the picture, where
you create that whole unified profile

72
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:17,054
about your social preferences to, to
help marketeers do better targeting.

73
00:04:17,744 --> 00:04:19,914
And all of these gave rise to big data.

74
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,829
And that led to the advent
of artificial intelligence.

75
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:28,349
Now generative AI is only a type
of artificial intelligence, okay?

76
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:31,359
Because we generally
just talk about AI as ai.

77
00:04:31,489 --> 00:04:32,659
And that is the only kind of.

78
00:04:33,114 --> 00:04:33,724
Artificial sorry.

79
00:04:33,724 --> 00:04:36,034
Machine learning is the only
kind of artificial intelligence

80
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:37,384
that we humans know of.

81
00:04:38,024 --> 00:04:42,884
But where generative AI comes in is
basically it's a deep learning form of

82
00:04:42,884 --> 00:04:47,234
artificial intelligence, which means
that it is able to process, I think

83
00:04:47,474 --> 00:04:51,184
analogous to how the human brain, you
can do processing of multiple layers

84
00:04:51,184 --> 00:04:52,984
of information to come to your output.

85
00:04:53,614 --> 00:04:54,729
And that's basically.

86
00:04:55,504 --> 00:05:00,064
An evolution from what marketeers
have been doing for the last 20 years.

87
00:05:00,404 --> 00:05:04,544
For example, I used to head a
product called Adobe Media Optimizer

88
00:05:04,944 --> 00:05:07,004
which was from 2014 to 2019.

89
00:05:07,124 --> 00:05:10,484
And that was a very powerful
machine learning system, but

90
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,134
it was a predictive AI system.

91
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:13,394
There was no generative ai.

92
00:05:13,874 --> 00:05:18,164
What generative AI helps you do is it
helps you to create, so whether it's

93
00:05:18,164 --> 00:05:23,354
art new forms of creatives, and of
course, as we saw it uses deep learning

94
00:05:23,414 --> 00:05:25,304
as its foundational form of delivery.

95
00:05:25,844 --> 00:05:28,754
Again, the other thing we need to
understand is what exactly are these

96
00:05:28,754 --> 00:05:32,504
data models that people keep talking
about, LLMs and models and et cetera.

97
00:05:32,924 --> 00:05:38,234
But the easiest way to describe
that is it's, and it's a system

98
00:05:38,234 --> 00:05:39,944
which takes in existing data.

99
00:05:40,034 --> 00:05:40,244
Okay.

100
00:05:40,244 --> 00:05:41,534
Like text image videos.

101
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:45,569
And it understands what those things are.

102
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:51,059
For example if you ask Chad GPD to create
an image of a cat, it looks at a database

103
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:56,219
of what cats look like, and based on your
prompt, it generates or it predictively

104
00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:57,539
generates what should come next.

105
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,429
And that's basically what it throws.

106
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:02,099
So that's basically what data model is.

107
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:06,299
So you take data in, you prompt
it, and based on that you can get

108
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:07,579
the output that you're looking for.

109
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:10,039
So that's like a very ELI
five version of Gen ai.

110
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:13,549
And the reason I'm talking
about that is vibe marketing.

111
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:17,389
The whole term came from the fact
that generative AI became so much

112
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:20,749
access, so easily accessible,
not just to individuals, but

113
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:22,159
also to enterprises via APIs.

114
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:26,239
What why marketing now?

115
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:29,639
Because gen AI came, I think
it's been about two and a half

116
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,489
years since open AI can launched
the public version of chat GBT.

117
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:38,489
But what's happening now is, and this is
true in, in the industry of marketing,

118
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:42,699
that marketing does tend to react a
little bit slow to these technological

119
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:46,799
advances, not because that's the nature
of it, but because a lot of iteration

120
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:51,659
and testing usually has to be done
before taking an idea from a concept

121
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:53,549
to an enterprise ready platform.

122
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:54,659
Okay?

123
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:58,079
But what's happening now is like,
based on various studies and surveys,

124
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,969
you can see 67% of CMOs are pivoting.

125
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:02,799
They're pivoting towards
generative ai, but.

126
00:07:03,204 --> 00:07:06,174
By doing that, they are
indirectly also getting into

127
00:07:06,174 --> 00:07:07,524
the whole vibe marketing scene.

128
00:07:08,014 --> 00:07:10,389
Second thing is people are
starting to notice that.

129
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:14,574
When you, in the past, you need to
have, you had to have 10 marketeers,

130
00:07:14,844 --> 00:07:18,774
but now you can get that job done with
just one person and use a bunch of

131
00:07:18,824 --> 00:07:24,224
these AI tools which replicate, and
in many ways, they do a better job

132
00:07:24,254 --> 00:07:26,164
than most of the human counterparts.

133
00:07:26,744 --> 00:07:29,954
And because of, and a second thing
is it's not just a number of people

134
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:31,519
who are involved, but it's also.

135
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:36,249
How much time it's taking for marketing
teams to go from conceptualization

136
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:37,509
to execution of the campaigns.

137
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:42,089
And then we also see that there
is a huge shift in consumers

138
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:43,529
also wanting vibe match.

139
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:46,199
Honestly, that just means
personalization to me.

140
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:52,829
But we are now able to personalize not
just at a need level, but also at a level.

141
00:07:52,859 --> 00:07:54,399
For example, you could.

142
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,889
You could include you could make
your emails sound in a certain slang

143
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:02,579
or in a certain dialect, which was
impossible earlier because you had to

144
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:04,259
manually instruct the system to do that.

145
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:07,839
But now by putting checks and
balances in place, you are able to

146
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,889
do that by just sending out a prompt.

147
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:12,949
And most importantly, obviously
it's all about the money.

148
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:15,199
And that's where we can see that.

149
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:19,484
Companies using a lot in generative
AI are typically seeing a higher

150
00:08:19,515 --> 00:08:23,725
return on ad spend which is
always the most important metric.

151
00:08:24,385 --> 00:08:29,565
Key differences are just to lay it
out, speed, it's much faster to launch.

152
00:08:29,665 --> 00:08:31,885
Any campaigns if you're
using generative ai.

153
00:08:32,335 --> 00:08:34,315
Team sizes are smaller, more agile.

154
00:08:35,095 --> 00:08:39,635
And you also have a little bit more
control because the coordination aspect of

155
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:41,945
working with multiple people disappears.

156
00:08:42,245 --> 00:08:47,085
In this model you are also able to run
these campaigns at a much lower cost.

157
00:08:47,295 --> 00:08:51,455
AI tools don't cause, don't cost like
enterprise sauce tools, they, they're

158
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:55,475
not like a million dollar purchase you
make, you usually pay on a monthly basis.

159
00:08:55,955 --> 00:08:58,625
And if you don't like the tool, you
can always move to a different one.

160
00:08:59,235 --> 00:09:02,405
Personalization wise in the past,
as I said, you could personalize

161
00:09:02,435 --> 00:09:05,225
you, you can still personalize,
but now it's hyper-personalized.

162
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:06,215
It's very mood based.

163
00:09:06,805 --> 00:09:12,415
Testing, it's it's again, faster
because, not because it, the, the testing

164
00:09:12,415 --> 00:09:13,550
methodologies have changed, which are.

165
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:18,415
They're pretty much the same AB
testing multi-arm banded, et cetera.

166
00:09:18,805 --> 00:09:22,085
But the speed at which you
can do it now is much faster.

167
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:26,525
Also you're able to focus more on the
emotional connection, which with the

168
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:30,305
customer, which is becoming a very
important factor, especially because

169
00:09:30,355 --> 00:09:34,625
brand loyalty has dropped significantly
over the last couple of over, I would say

170
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,185
over the last couple of decades actually.

171
00:09:36,305 --> 00:09:37,805
And finally, workflow.

172
00:09:38,505 --> 00:09:41,145
If you know how to use the right
tools, if you have a little bit of

173
00:09:41,225 --> 00:09:45,815
understanding of automation tools
like Zapier, or if you have a little

174
00:09:45,815 --> 00:09:50,015
bit of skill in coding in Python,
or even like prompting chat, GPT or.

175
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,920
Any of these tools to give you the
right prompt, you're able to move

176
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,420
really fast and adopt really fast.

177
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,650
So those are the main differences
between traditional vibe marketing.

178
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,880
Now, the way vibe marketing moves,
and this is, and of course different

179
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,975
companies have different flows, but this
is my way of doing it now is and it's

180
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:11,470
not different from running a standard
marketing campaign, it's just that

181
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,520
the tools have changed to some extent.

182
00:10:14,225 --> 00:10:17,745
So defining the vibe defining the
vibe is basically defining what a

183
00:10:17,745 --> 00:10:21,105
creative direction that we are trying
to get for this particular campaign.

184
00:10:21,635 --> 00:10:26,075
Take that, prompt it into AI in
natural language, and then the

185
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:27,215
AI starts to generate content.

186
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:27,605
Okay?

187
00:10:27,635 --> 00:10:32,705
And right now most of this content
is primarily text-based, but

188
00:10:32,755 --> 00:10:33,990
we are reaching a point where.

189
00:10:34,975 --> 00:10:39,995
To a certain, at a certain limited
level, you are able to create images and

190
00:10:39,995 --> 00:10:42,275
even videos which have customization.

191
00:10:42,545 --> 00:10:47,485
Although in mainstream, I probably
seen only five or six video ads,

192
00:10:47,485 --> 00:10:49,105
which were completely AI generated.

193
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:54,295
But that's also because it's really
expensive and it's not a great solution

194
00:10:54,295 --> 00:10:56,505
for SMBs and startups right now.

195
00:10:57,085 --> 00:11:00,675
But again, we'll get to that in a bit
to see where the where the remaining

196
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,965
remainder of the challenges are.

197
00:11:02,665 --> 00:11:05,335
And then after that, testing and
launching again there's a bit of

198
00:11:05,335 --> 00:11:08,655
manual work involved nowadays,
but I think in about five years

199
00:11:08,655 --> 00:11:10,455
that's gonna be automated as well.

200
00:11:11,245 --> 00:11:13,195
Then it's about analyzing and optimizing.

201
00:11:13,195 --> 00:11:17,255
So bringing the data you can automate
that data, send it to something

202
00:11:17,255 --> 00:11:21,815
like Google Data Studio, Tableau,
or you can just do your good old.

203
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,180
Excel analysis, it doesn't matter,
but what's important is taking that

204
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,800
data and then having a chat with these
LLM models, understanding where the

205
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,170
optimization opportunities are, and then
adapting your campaign based on the the

206
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,390
feedback that you are able to generate.

207
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,190
Okay.

208
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:45,580
These are just a few of the tools
that are available right now and the

209
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,320
best thing about these tools is that.

210
00:11:47,675 --> 00:11:52,325
Whether you are a startup, scale
up SMB, or large enterprise, there

211
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:53,585
is something for you out there.

212
00:11:54,195 --> 00:11:57,425
And I have been involved in the
entire spectrum of company sizes.

213
00:11:57,845 --> 00:12:01,745
So for example, as a big enterprise,
I would just speak to somebody like

214
00:12:01,745 --> 00:12:05,415
Salesforce, Adobe, or HubSpot use
their enterprise ready products.

215
00:12:06,235 --> 00:12:10,015
Although they can be a bit inflexible
sometimes, but for majority of

216
00:12:10,015 --> 00:12:12,825
these large size clients I think
those tools will be sufficient.

217
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,655
And of course you will use
those in combination with

218
00:12:15,655 --> 00:12:16,825
some of the smaller tools.

219
00:12:17,225 --> 00:12:18,305
If you're a smaller company.

220
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,110
You have these subscription based options
and I've seen tools which are as cheap

221
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,750
as $14 a month, and they do a decent job.

222
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,880
And I, and we and I'm saying decent
because as you will see in a bit

223
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,210
why the, why marketing hasn't
actually reached its full potential

224
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,560
when I do the demo in a bit.

225
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,070
But as you can see.

226
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,260
If you wanna start testing out,
there are plenty of options.

227
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,920
A lot of free options as well.

228
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,870
So I would say go and test as many
of these as you can see which fits

229
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,690
your company's requirements the
most, and then stick to those.

230
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,470
Some of the recent viral campaigns,
which have done vibe marketing.

231
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,360
They come from Coca-Cola.

232
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,910
Which which made this really interesting
campaign where they use Dali.

233
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:05,550
So Dali is the image generation model of
open AI to basically let fans generate

234
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,620
AI r inspired by the Koch branding.

235
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,330
It sounds really simple,
it caught on really well.

236
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,060
So they received over 120,000 submissions.

237
00:13:13,345 --> 00:13:15,385
And over 7 million social impressions.

238
00:13:15,385 --> 00:13:20,535
So I would say that as a pioneer
of using gen AI for advertising,

239
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:22,095
I think Coke's doing a great job.

240
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:25,885
But again, if you move to a more
performance based example, which

241
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:29,705
is Heinz catch up they did a
similar thing where they basically

242
00:13:29,705 --> 00:13:33,425
used image generation models to
create visuals of ketchup bottles.

243
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:34,385
Sounds really.

244
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:40,170
Basic, but they did get a 40% higher
ROI on these AI generated video ads.

245
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,690
So I would say that was a big success.

246
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,140
Mango has been doing something like
that, so they've been using virtual

247
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,335
models for their summer collection.

248
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,960
A lot of people are a little bit
on the fence, but I think the

249
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,770
quality of these image images
generated are getting so good.

250
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,950
There'll be a point in the
future where it'll be, they'll be

251
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,930
indistinguishable from real people.

252
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,240
One of the most interesting ones
I've seen though, was this Virgin

253
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,750
Voyages, which basically featured
gen ai, which is, Jennifer Lopez,

254
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,925
but a deep fake versions of her.

255
00:14:10,285 --> 00:14:11,775
So you can create.

256
00:14:11,805 --> 00:14:15,105
Personalized video invitations
using Deepak versions of her.

257
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:19,415
And of course, it's a bit of a
novelty, but it really impressed

258
00:14:19,415 --> 00:14:21,505
how Virgin was quick to doing that.

259
00:14:22,075 --> 00:14:24,025
Of course, that gave them
tremendous amount of viral

260
00:14:24,025 --> 00:14:25,645
engagements increasing in bookings.

261
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:29,545
So I think the investments that they made
in this definitely paid off for them.

262
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,030
All right.

263
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:35,270
With that, I wanna do a quick demo
to show you a very simple workflow

264
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,510
of what a vibe marketing kind
of methodology would look like.

265
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,620
Now, obviously, what I'll show
you is not an all encompassing.

266
00:14:44,435 --> 00:14:45,665
Example, big comp.

267
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:51,495
This is probably more suitable for smaller
companies, SMBs, startups enterprise

268
00:14:51,495 --> 00:14:55,905
companies will have some of these tools
built in house with the right guard list.

269
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:58,785
But anyway, let's move on to the demo.

270
00:14:59,385 --> 00:15:02,625
So let me pull up.

271
00:15:03,385 --> 00:15:07,275
So what we're trying to do is in
this case, is we let's assume we, we

272
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:08,445
are this company called Hoka, right?

273
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:09,875
You've probably seen shoes from Hoka.

274
00:15:10,505 --> 00:15:14,315
So let's assume that we have
a new campaign coming up.

275
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:20,440
And we need to be able to create ad
copies and also add creatives, which which

276
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,670
basically, so typically what a digital,
an advertising or marketing person would

277
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:30,620
do at this point is they have to manually
write down these copies, manually create

278
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,300
these images to create variations, okay?

279
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,470
And that usually would take depending
on how big the camping is, that

280
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,690
could take two to three days.

281
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,500
But here's how fast you
can do it in chat, GBD.

282
00:15:42,295 --> 00:15:45,295
All I have to do is, and this is
something, this is a best practice, I

283
00:15:45,295 --> 00:15:49,995
would say create a separate thread with
Chad, GPD, where you give instructions for

284
00:15:49,995 --> 00:15:55,635
a specific platform or a channel, like in
this case I'm looking at X as an example.

285
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:58,915
So what I'm telling Chad, GPD, is that.

286
00:15:59,245 --> 00:16:03,400
I need to create we, we will use
this thread to create ad copies,

287
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,670
creatives for my company, Hoka, for
each camping I will share instructions,

288
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,570
guidelines, et cetera, et cetera, to
create the best ads possible, right?

289
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,240
So it got it.

290
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,080
And then here is the the
camping instructions that

291
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,450
I'm sharing with chat GPT.

292
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,140
To be honest, I have used
chat GPT to refine this.

293
00:16:21,145 --> 00:16:25,165
I just put like the raw information
in and this is the refined output.

294
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,290
But what's important is obviously to put
the important campaign factors, like what

295
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:34,640
your target audience is, what the brand
guidelines are, what key phrases to use,

296
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,170
color palette, et cetera, et cetera.

297
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,260
So you, as a marketeer, you would
know typically this is what you get

298
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,370
a brief from the client or from your,
companies, internal departments.

299
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,960
But if you are in a startup trying to
do vibe marketing I would say this is

300
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,940
a really easy, simple way to make sure
that your advertise your ads and your

301
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,130
creative stay within your requirements.

302
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:59,875
Alright and while I'm asking it is
create three variations of the ad copy.

303
00:17:00,675 --> 00:17:02,205
Then three different images.

304
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,635
And so it went to work.

305
00:17:05,085 --> 00:17:09,835
It created this really impressive ad
copies with great call to actions with

306
00:17:09,835 --> 00:17:11,305
all the right information in place.

307
00:17:11,425 --> 00:17:15,995
And on top of that, it also
helped me create this this copy.

308
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:17,105
I think it looks great.

309
00:17:17,145 --> 00:17:20,865
I would just take it and put it straight
up into an ad. Obviously there are

310
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:22,635
some minor things I need to look after.

311
00:17:22,635 --> 00:17:26,205
For example, as you can see, the color's
not contrasting with the background.

312
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:30,790
And so then again, this is one of the
things I wanted to mention earlier, the

313
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:35,650
reality of why marketing is that you will
still need a bit of human intervention.

314
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,070
Okay?

315
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,005
So it's still gonna make your
work about five, six times faster.

316
00:17:40,455 --> 00:17:43,245
But there are these, if you are spec,
especially if you're a big company

317
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:47,565
with very strict guidelines, you have
to ensure that these kind of issues

318
00:17:47,955 --> 00:17:49,605
don't make it to the final version.

319
00:17:50,385 --> 00:17:50,745
Okay?

320
00:17:51,225 --> 00:17:53,875
And this so it went on
and on and it made, and.

321
00:17:54,355 --> 00:17:57,145
It stopped generating because I
ran out of credits at this point.

322
00:17:57,415 --> 00:18:02,655
However, as a, if you're, obviously,
if you're using a company account, then

323
00:18:02,655 --> 00:18:06,495
you can connect directly with Dali's
AI and then get these images generated.

324
00:18:06,495 --> 00:18:08,405
That's a really powerful
feature I would say.

325
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:12,125
Now, as far as I know, there are
no other third party solutions

326
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,475
which are able to generate.

327
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:16,325
Compelling ads like this at scale?

328
00:18:16,885 --> 00:18:21,155
At least in, at least based on my
knowledge the alternative to this

329
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:27,095
is, for example, you can actually
go into Canva and I'm just gonna, I.

330
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,580
You can actually go into Canva and
then you can manually create those

331
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,850
different versions of the ad as well.

332
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,860
But again, that requires
a bit of manual work.

333
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,170
It does make your work a bit faster.

334
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,980
I'll give an example.

335
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:43,620
For example, let's say if you take
the image of of the shoe, right?

336
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,180
For example, let me
just bring it up again.

337
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:49,410
And there, there's a shoe and I want to
quickly put it on a background, right?

338
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,330
So all I have to do is
remove the background.

339
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,890
And there you go.

340
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,240
That was done by ai.

341
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,870
And then I can take a template from here.

342
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,320
Let me put something like adventure,

343
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,080
right?

344
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,520
So obviously not all of these are
gonna match what you're looking

345
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,500
out, looking for, but I'm sure
there'll be something out there.

346
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,160
And just for the sake of, for
example, we just put somewhere like

347
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,340
here, oh, that's actually a video.

348
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,310
Let me just gimme an example.

349
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,090
Gimme a second.

350
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,070
I'm just gonna try to
find something useful.

351
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,910
Oh, these are all videos for some reason.

352
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,490
Just one second.

353
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,400
I think you have to spend some
time finding the right background,

354
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,950
but once you do, of course you can
upload your own background as well.

355
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:39,820
But once you do that, it's very easy
to just put this on that and it,

356
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,930
it's not gonna be a perfect ad copy,
but if you're looking for speed over

357
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,730
perfection, then this is a great option.

358
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:51,255
And then obviously what you have to look
at is you still have to go in and and.

359
00:19:51,705 --> 00:19:53,745
You still have to go and analyze.

360
00:19:54,015 --> 00:19:56,115
You still have to upload those ad copies.

361
00:19:56,355 --> 00:20:01,585
Now, there are tools out there there
are tools out there which help you,

362
00:20:01,795 --> 00:20:06,555
which connect automatically to Facebook
and Google and, various ad platforms

363
00:20:06,655 --> 00:20:12,195
systems via API, where you can directly
push the ad copies and the images.

364
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:13,835
The only caveat there is that.

365
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:18,360
Those systems don't have a generative
AI system to generate those copies.

366
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,870
So as you can see, there's already,
this is one of the other issues

367
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,050
of wire marketing is there, the
entire ecosystem is fragmented.

368
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,890
And because of which, you're not able
to automate it end to end, right?

369
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,510
So again, that's something else
that you just need to be aware of.

370
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,830
Apart from that, what you could
also look at is doing some of

371
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,580
these things on your own Now.

372
00:20:38,465 --> 00:20:41,835
This is sentiment analysis,
which I was doing for a company.

373
00:20:42,765 --> 00:20:48,015
And so basically what we, they basically
gave me a list of all the various

374
00:20:48,015 --> 00:20:51,705
comments that were reviews, et cetera,
that were shared by the customers.

375
00:20:52,155 --> 00:20:55,215
And what I did was I spoke to Chad,
GPD and said, Hey, you know what?

376
00:20:55,665 --> 00:20:57,375
I need to analyze these.

377
00:20:57,735 --> 00:21:01,215
I don't have a, I don't have a paid
version of a software, but I'm sure

378
00:21:01,215 --> 00:21:04,695
there are free kind of libraries
and tools available on Python.

379
00:21:04,935 --> 00:21:05,745
Let's use those.

380
00:21:06,255 --> 00:21:08,355
And of course, it gave me the code.

381
00:21:08,415 --> 00:21:12,445
All I had to do is put the data
in and then after a few iterations

382
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:13,850
and after a few to and fros.

383
00:21:14,785 --> 00:21:18,415
I managed to get this, basically to
find out that the biggest problem that

384
00:21:18,415 --> 00:21:21,505
the company was having is they were
ha people were having login issues.

385
00:21:21,955 --> 00:21:25,865
So this helped us prioritize the features
that need to, needed to be fixed.

386
00:21:26,135 --> 00:21:31,145
And the best part is this entire process
took me only about 20 minutes to do.

387
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:33,875
And it was completely free, right?

388
00:21:34,145 --> 00:21:35,735
'cause all I had to do was run Python.

389
00:21:36,005 --> 00:21:38,075
Now obviously, if you want to run this.

390
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:42,290
Another time you can create this as a
separate application and all you have to

391
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,210
do is upload the data in the right format.

392
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:49,250
So that's another way that Vibe marketing
can help you save not just a lot of time,

393
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,620
but a lot of money for your company.

394
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,005
And also it can basically create
these systems which are very specific

395
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,610
to your company's requirements.

396
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,340
Similarly, I did another analysis.

397
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,750
And this was for segmentation to
understand which area should we be

398
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,970
focusing on to increase the revenue.

399
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,200
And this was for a gaming company.

400
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:12,910
So basically we found that getting people
to a whale status, which is getting them

401
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:17,260
to spend a bit more like fractional ends
up getting them spending a lot more.

402
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,930
So we were like, okay, maybe
we should build features to

403
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,010
help them get to that point.

404
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,380
Also maybe, win rates, for
example, could we reduce the

405
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,580
difficulty levels of the game?

406
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:30,390
And again, the entire process
completely guided by chat, GPD.

407
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:33,760
All I had to do was put
the data that we had and.

408
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,920
It produce a response from me.

409
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:39,760
So that's another way in which I
think you can definitely save a lot

410
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,140
of time, money, and on resources
to get an output like this.

411
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,070
Okay.

412
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:50,360
So I think what we've seen so far
is that vibe marketing is fantastic.

413
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,160
It's going to change the world.

414
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,935
It's gonna change the world
in many ways in how people do

415
00:22:55,935 --> 00:22:59,295
marketing go to market, the speed,
execution, time, money, et cetera.

416
00:22:59,815 --> 00:23:00,175
But.

417
00:23:00,775 --> 00:23:03,410
As you saw in the demo there,
there's a bit of an issue there.

418
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,680
Is the whole ecosystem is very fragmented.

419
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,410
Now, this full stack marketing roadmap,
as you can see in the top layer.

420
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,080
This is where the AI part
comes in, the vibe marketing.

421
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:18,310
Now, I'm not saying that the tools
which are below that category don't

422
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:23,290
have any artificial intelligence,
but their use of AI is very specific.

423
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:26,645
It goes quite deep and you can do
all the AI stuff you want at the

424
00:23:26,645 --> 00:23:30,065
top, but you still have layers and
layers of integration to go through.

425
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:33,685
And at this point, of course you
can chat with chat g and find

426
00:23:33,685 --> 00:23:35,085
out, what's the best way to do it.

427
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:39,165
But usually what I've found is that
someone, somebody with experience running

428
00:23:39,225 --> 00:23:43,365
these various tools is a much faster
and more accurate bet because you don't

429
00:23:43,365 --> 00:23:47,055
have to do that trial and error to get
to the output that you're looking for.

430
00:23:47,735 --> 00:23:49,085
So I think that's the first problem.

431
00:23:49,535 --> 00:23:55,525
The second and more serious problem is
that there is a huge data safety issue.

432
00:23:55,975 --> 00:23:59,875
Now, of course, whether you're a small
company or a big company ensuring

433
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:05,035
that your in-house data, your ips,
et cetera, stay in-house, right?

434
00:24:05,065 --> 00:24:08,755
It shouldn't get shared on the free
internet where anybody can access it.

435
00:24:09,205 --> 00:24:12,205
It has happened, for example,
when chat GPD first came out.

436
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:16,210
I think there was a developer from
Samsung who wanted to get some ideas

437
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,960
about his code and he published the
entire code base of his product,

438
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,640
Samsung product on chat GPT.

439
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:26,240
And because, these LMS are a
bit of a black box, anyone could

440
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,650
access that code after that.

441
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,640
So those are issues.

442
00:24:29,155 --> 00:24:33,395
To avoid that companies like this
framework is from my days at Salesforce.

443
00:24:33,525 --> 00:24:35,865
Companies do, have different frameworks.

444
00:24:35,865 --> 00:24:37,875
This one is called the
data security framework.

445
00:24:38,205 --> 00:24:42,545
Now, this works really interestingly
because when we prompt something

446
00:24:42,545 --> 00:24:46,235
like prompt, you prompt an LLM,
it goes into the framework.

447
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:49,960
What happens is there is that the
first step is there is a secure

448
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,430
data retrieval, which is to ensure
that only data, which has been

449
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,110
sanctioned or approved for sharing
with these lms, get approved, right?

450
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,250
So companies like, as you can see,
products of major enterprises like

451
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,470
Salesforce, they already have those
guard rates built in place and

452
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,930
that's why they charge, hundreds
and s of dollars for the products.

453
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,450
Second and very important is grounding.

454
00:25:11,095 --> 00:25:13,465
Grounding is where the actual
personalization happens, right?

455
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:16,725
If you take an example
of Ticketmaster, right?

456
00:25:17,035 --> 00:25:19,105
And for example, let's
say I like pop music.

457
00:25:19,105 --> 00:25:20,095
My wife likes jazz.

458
00:25:20,095 --> 00:25:25,665
I. You want to send future pop
music concert recommendations

459
00:25:25,665 --> 00:25:26,535
to me, not my wife.

460
00:25:26,745 --> 00:25:29,925
It's a very basic thing, but the
important thing is that there's data

461
00:25:29,925 --> 00:25:34,275
being shared between you and a potential
third party, LLM, and there are ways

462
00:25:34,275 --> 00:25:36,255
to prevent that data from leaking.

463
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:40,545
For example, you can do masking, you
can do encryption, pretty standard

464
00:25:40,935 --> 00:25:43,875
procedures, but you need to make
sure that is happening at some level.

465
00:25:44,145 --> 00:25:46,575
If you are interacting with an LLM.

466
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,540
With your company's private data.

467
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:53,340
And then comes the gateway feature,
which is, as the data is sent to

468
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,320
these lms, you have two options.

469
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,840
One you can work with.

470
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:02,410
You can work with one of these big
lms using APIs to make sure that

471
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:05,670
the the kind of right parsing of
data right output is coming out.

472
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,980
But you also have to make sure
contractually or by system design that.

473
00:26:13,015 --> 00:26:16,105
The data which has been shared
with them is not stored.

474
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:16,970
It's removed.

475
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:18,895
I'll offer your session with them.

476
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:22,405
The other option, obviously is that
you can ho you know, have your own

477
00:26:22,405 --> 00:26:26,485
locally hosted models, which may
not be a financially viable option

478
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:30,685
for smaller companies because they
tend to get really expensive as the

479
00:26:30,685 --> 00:26:33,275
processing, capacity requirement goes up.

480
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,180
And then comes generation.

481
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,500
Generation is where the output is.

482
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,110
Seen.

483
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:41,820
Usually a strong data security framework
will have guardrails in place to make

484
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:46,170
sure that there are no hallucinations
or toxicity coming out of generation.

485
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,110
Now this process is, is best.

486
00:26:48,515 --> 00:26:52,955
If it's done automatically, but it may
need some manual intervention as well.

487
00:26:53,435 --> 00:26:57,755
And finally, you also need an audit
trail to, to understand that if something

488
00:26:57,755 --> 00:27:01,525
goes wrong, you need to know at what
point of the process what did this

489
00:27:01,525 --> 00:27:06,175
happen and who was operating with the
system at that time Only once all those.

490
00:27:06,505 --> 00:27:10,675
All these different areas are looked
after, that's when you can send it

491
00:27:10,675 --> 00:27:14,755
to your third party platforms like
marketing apps, APIs, data exchanges.

492
00:27:14,845 --> 00:27:18,815
And I think this is a
part of the process that.

493
00:27:19,325 --> 00:27:21,995
A lot of marketeers are
underestimating right now if you ask

494
00:27:21,995 --> 00:27:23,675
me, especially smaller companies.

495
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:27,655
But if you don't take these
precautions now as you scale up,

496
00:27:27,655 --> 00:27:30,165
become a larger company these
could come back to haunt you.

497
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:32,515
So just be careful about that.

498
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:37,370
So I think that's all the time I
have for now and thank you very much.

499
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,340
Obviously, if you have any questions,
feel free to reach out to me.

500
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,720
My email is up there.

501
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,080
But once again, thanks very much
for coming to my presentation

502
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,820
and I hope to hear from you.

503
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:47,450
Thank you.
