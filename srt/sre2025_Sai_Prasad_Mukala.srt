00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi this is Cypress, the Moala.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:10,760
I'm working as a enterprise architect in
Focus INC. Today I'm going to talk about

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:17,285
site reliability at scale, architecting,
resilient, multi-cloud infrastructure,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,040
multi-cloud reality.

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,590
I'm going to talk about strategic
advantage, technical resiliency.

6
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:35,285
Cost optimization coming to the static
advantage, eliminating single point of

7
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:44,135
failure is one of the most effective
way to build a resilient, capable,

8
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:52,350
and reliable cloud infrastructure by
embarrassing diversified cloud partnership

9
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,470
and vendor agnostic architecture.

10
00:00:56,225 --> 00:01:04,444
Business can ensure continuity, reduce
risk, and achieve a greater flexibility.

11
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:13,085
This strategy is crucial in maintaining
business operations even when certain

12
00:01:13,085 --> 00:01:21,574
cloud services, expensive outage or
issues coming to the technical resilience.

13
00:01:23,089 --> 00:01:30,770
Technical resilience refers to your system
ability to maintain high availability,

14
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:39,409
reliability, and performance, even in the
face of failures or unexpected disruptions

15
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,434
in the context of cloud environments.

16
00:01:43,225 --> 00:01:50,814
This means design your infrastructure,
so it can withstand yet quickly

17
00:01:50,994 --> 00:01:58,314
recover from any issues minimizing
downtime and services disruption.

18
00:01:59,094 --> 00:02:05,154
In multi-cloud environment,
workloads are distributed across

19
00:02:05,214 --> 00:02:11,129
more than one cloud provider,
enabling you to benefit from each.

20
00:02:11,725 --> 00:02:16,855
Providers strength and
mitigate potential risk.

21
00:02:17,394 --> 00:02:24,565
Coming to the cost optimization in
today com, tive Cloud landscape,

22
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:30,744
optimizing the cost is a crucial
part of any cloud strategy.

23
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:37,945
Each cloud provider has its unique pricing
structure, services, and strengths.

24
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:44,829
By strategically leveraging these
differences, business can maximize

25
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:51,820
the performance to cost ratio
and ensure the best value for

26
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,980
their cloud infrastructure spend.

27
00:02:54,489 --> 00:03:00,670
For example, one, provide provider
may offer more cost effective

28
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,489
storage while another may be.

29
00:03:04,089 --> 00:03:12,309
Better suited for compute heavy workloads,
allowing business to allocate resources

30
00:03:12,529 --> 00:03:15,589
in a way that minimize expenses.

31
00:03:16,589 --> 00:03:19,739
Cloud native architecture, evolution,

32
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,279
monolithic apps, microservices,
containerization,

33
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:30,079
Kubernetes orchestration.

34
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:32,040
Monolithic apps.

35
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:33,869
Monolithic apps

36
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:42,989
have been the traditional approach
for building software system for many

37
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:50,189
years in monolithic architecture,
all components of application such

38
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:57,269
as user interface, database, business
logic, and data access layers.

39
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:03,015
Are tightly coupled and
reside in a single core base.

40
00:04:03,314 --> 00:04:08,834
While this approach has its
advantages, it also comes with

41
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:15,884
significant limitations, especially
as a application grow in size and

42
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:23,955
complexity, coming to the microservices,
decoupled, independently deployable

43
00:04:23,955 --> 00:04:27,135
services that communicate through.

44
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,090
Well-defined APIs.

45
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:39,330
This architecture enables targeted
scaling, improved resilience, and faster

46
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,870
delivery of individual components.

47
00:04:44,794 --> 00:04:52,289
Containerization, isolated, lightweight
and portable runtime environment

48
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,140
that package applications with.

49
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:03,270
Their dependencies, ensuring
consistency across development and

50
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,209
testing and production environments.

51
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:14,819
Coming to the Kubernetes orchestration,
a production grade platform for automatic

52
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:23,794
deployment, scaling and management
of contention applications it use.

53
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:30,405
Declarative configurations and
built in fall to tolerance to ensure

54
00:05:30,885 --> 00:05:34,125
high availability and resiliency.

55
00:05:36,465 --> 00:05:42,554

MTTR reduction, 68%.

56
00:05:44,085 --> 00:05:46,934
Operational cost to savings, 47%.

57
00:05:47,684 --> 00:05:55,304
Incident response acceleration, 3.2 x.
So coming to the MTTR reduction, 68%

58
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:05,474
AI powered diagnostic engine utilize
advanced algorithms to analyze vast

59
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:12,885
amount of data in real time quickly
identifying the root cause of incidents.

60
00:06:13,304 --> 00:06:20,684
These systems can automate process
of isolating and diagnosing issues.

61
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:27,870
Eliminating the need of manual
intervention and reducing the take

62
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:31,470
it taken to resolve an incident.

63
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:39,390
This precision leads to substantial
reduction in meantime to resolve

64
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:46,890
by ensuring teams focus on the
most accurate diagnostics first.

65
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:52,380
Rather than wasting time on
trial and error approaches,

66
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:56,579
operational cost reduction, 47%.

67
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:04,319
AI driven predictive models use
historical data, mission learning

68
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:12,299
algorithms and pattern recognition to
detect anom analyze before they evolve

69
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:16,079
into major issues By identifying.

70
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:24,240
Our potential systems failures early
AI can trigger preventive actions

71
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:31,770
such as automated adjustments,
resource scaling, or alert IT teams.

72
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:36,300
This not only reduce the need for costly.

73
00:07:36,734 --> 00:07:44,145
Emergency fixes, but also lower
downtime and the resources spent

74
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:51,525
on reactive maintenance, driving

By using rural networks,
AI can intelligently.

78
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:14,910
Access incoming incidents and determine
their severity, urgency, and impact

79
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:22,710
based on historical incidents, data
system performance, and contextual clues.

80
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:29,040
This optimized triage system
ensure that critical incidents

81
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,250
are routed to appropriate teams.

82
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:36,539
Faster and with higher precision.

83
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:43,619
Instead of wasting time on manual

00:17:31,495 --> 00:17:38,545
infrastructure with ML driven prediction
and autonomous recovery workflows.

176
00:17:40,765 --> 00:17:45,750
Practice shows engineering
systematically introduce.

177
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:52,260
Controlled failures to validate
resilience, mechanism and

178
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,420
uncover hidden dependencies.

179
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:02,400
Key takeaways, multi-cloud
standardization, AI driven incident

180
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,000
response, edge computing, architecture,
security, reliability, integration.

181
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:16,830
So multi-cloud standardization, implement
consistently observability frameworks

182
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:23,850
and shared metric across cloud providers
while maintaining, provide specific

183
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,510
optimization, AI driven incident response.

184
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:34,590
Deploy ML powered prediction
models with autonomous recovery

185
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,385
workforce to reduce MTTR by.

186
00:18:37,935 --> 00:18:46,455
To by up to 70% edge computing
architecture, extend reliability practices

187
00:18:46,485 --> 00:18:54,645
to accommodate 5G enabled edge deployments
with distributed observability solutions.

188
00:18:55,245 --> 00:19:02,175
Security, reliability integration
