00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,100
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:06,990
My name is Daniel, and, I'm a data
specialist, or I like to call myself.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,279
I revolve around the data analysis,
machine learning, and even as far

4
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:12,859
to natural language processing.

5
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:15,619
Also, I'm a data mentor
and a programming mentor.

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,029
I tend to assist people that are
looking to get on the data space

7
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:20,970
and also on the programming space.

8
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:25,120
Today, I'll be speaking on
DataSense, DataCentric, which

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,940
I shortened to DataSense, an
app that I built from scratch.

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:27,999
Thank you.

11
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,760
Using fully on the streamlit
framework in Python.

12
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:36,630
I'll be giving a live demo of the
app and I'm going to get started.

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,080
Turn this on.

14
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:39,720
Here we go.

15
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,680
So data analytics with Streamly by me.

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,590
DataSense, I have been using Power BI.

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,210
I've been using a tab
view, but mostly Power BI.

18
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,330
And I realized that you cannot really
get logged in with Power BI if you

19
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,020
don't have an organization on email.

20
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:02,800
for people, beginners that are just new
to the field, that does not know anything

21
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:08,689
about programming or analytical analysis,
they can't just get in Power BI if

22
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:10,710
they don't have, for example, students.

23
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,580
I felt like this is a very
major constraint for those

24
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,570
learning from my own experience.

25
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,300
I felt like I should create a hub.

26
00:01:18,585 --> 00:01:22,135
That will be easy for them
to use a learning curve for

27
00:01:22,145 --> 00:01:23,555
them and for me as well.

28
00:01:23,845 --> 00:01:26,615
So I did so many research
and I came up with Datasense.

29
00:01:27,115 --> 00:01:31,434
So it's a Python powered solution
for data exploration, visualization.

30
00:01:32,235 --> 00:01:36,205
It simplifies the whole process
of analysis, starting from

31
00:01:36,965 --> 00:01:40,575
putting, uploading your data
down to creating a visualization.

32
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:44,375
It's a very straightforward, I made
it as straightforward as possible,

33
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,595
making, analyzing the data set.

34
00:01:46,685 --> 00:01:49,675
and it's encouraging,
encourages self learning.

35
00:01:50,285 --> 00:01:54,705
So I found some problems, and I
created a solution with data science.

36
00:01:55,175 --> 00:01:57,955
I found that manual data
analysis is time consuming.

37
00:01:58,455 --> 00:02:03,225
When you get your data into Power
BI, it's on you to actually pick the

38
00:02:03,225 --> 00:02:05,790
one that has to be on the X axis.

39
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,130
And when you put it in, it gives
you error without really telling you

40
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,090
that, oh, this is the wrong data.

41
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,840
This is the wrong column
to put into this as is.

42
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:21,850
And it's so time consuming, error prone,
and many of them are non user friendly.

43
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,680
Especially for learners that are
trying to get on the platform.

44
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,240
You have to go through probably learning
via Udemy or something to actually

45
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,460
understand the app as it is built.

46
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:37,610
So I solved this problem by creating a
very straightforward interface that you

47
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:42,090
get your data in, takes you directly
to the data, you make your analysis,

48
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,580
and you're out as simple as possible.

49
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,580
I added an interactive dashboard
session powered with Plotly.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,253
Plotly is a visualization library
on Python that gets you more

51
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:59,585
information on the data compared
to the most popular Matplotlib.

52
00:03:00,205 --> 00:03:04,485
Engineers that don't want to
start making so many analysis,

53
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:05,675
writing the codes and all that.

54
00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:09,865
I did an exploratory data analysis for
them that you can just click on the

55
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:13,225
chart and you get your analysis done.

56
00:03:13,265 --> 00:03:15,085
And you know the context of your data.

57
00:03:15,415 --> 00:03:19,665
You know the skew at which your
numerical data, where it's aligned to.

58
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:24,925
You get your analysis and you go on
further to do your machine learning code.

59
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:29,155
So some of the key features,
the major features of the app

60
00:03:29,155 --> 00:03:31,155
is data upload by management.

61
00:03:31,465 --> 00:03:36,065
You have the option to upload CSV
file, most common CSV upload JSON

62
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:40,305
and you can upload Excel spreadsheet,
and then you can get sample data

63
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:45,405
from that and quickly go on to get
descriptive analysis of your data.

64
00:03:45,735 --> 00:03:49,195
You can get the, as many, how many
columns are in your data, how many

65
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:52,895
rows, and you can get the statistic
measure of your data, the mean, the

66
00:03:52,905 --> 00:03:55,145
mode, the mean, the standard deviation.

67
00:03:56,085 --> 00:03:59,725
The 21st, 25th percentile and whatnot.

68
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:02,995
Then you can go to the automated
exploratory data analysis

69
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:04,325
that I mentioned just now.

70
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:08,915
You can get, you can just click on the
chart and do your post plot analysis.

71
00:04:09,175 --> 00:04:11,865
Or probably you want to
check, the count plot.

72
00:04:12,145 --> 00:04:16,465
How many of this, say cities are in
your data, you can check it easily

73
00:04:16,985 --> 00:04:19,695
and then you can do your dashboard.

74
00:04:19,755 --> 00:04:24,675
You can get, create a dashboard
with up to four, four different

75
00:04:24,675 --> 00:04:26,145
graphs, four different shots.

76
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,220
with as many graphs as possible.

77
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,150
So now I'm going to log up onto
the app so I can show you the

78
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,100
demo of how everything works.

79
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,950
Let's get started.

80
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,940
So here we are, this is the app.

81
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,900
data sent, everything
here was written by me.

82
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,870
I wrote everything with the emojis
and the, and the, the fonts.

83
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,230
So data analysts are short on time.

84
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,480
Quickly go to the data page
and test the functionality.

85
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,050
Actually now, at the forefront,
you get the navigation.

86
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,430
This is where you can go to the data page.

87
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,740
Data page, upload your data.

88
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,310
You can go to, the dashboard.

89
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,200
There's no data yet.

90
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,590
So it tells you that
no data set available.

91
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,260
Please.

92
00:05:11,655 --> 00:05:16,055
Go back, click on this link, the
data page, to go upload the data.

93
00:05:16,755 --> 00:05:20,375
Then you can also go to the
exploratory dashboards analysis,

94
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,495
which tells you the same thing.

95
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,835
Go to the data page, which we will do now.

96
00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:26,195
Here you have two options, upload data.

97
00:05:26,495 --> 00:05:29,335
Just browse your files, you
can upload your data locally.

98
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,300
And, put your data in here,
the one you want to analyze.

99
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,830
Or, you can use my sample
data just to test the app out,

100
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,920
which I'm going to do now.

101
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,590
These stuffs, you can
read them if you want.

102
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,820
It's just a quick guide on how
the app works, but we're not going

103
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,450
to go through reading them now.

104
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,180
Because I'll be doing the demo.

105
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,720
And then you can pick data.

106
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,140
Yeah, you can pick FHIR data or
you can pick employee data, depends

107
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,690
on which you want to test out.

108
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,340
We'll go with the FHIR data first,
and then it loads successfully.

109
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,320
The beginning, it gives you everything
about the data, the top five rules.

110
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,820
This is akin to writing pandas.

111
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:06,610
head.

112
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,360
So this is the code, pandas.

113
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,270
head, bracket five is the
code behind this stuff.

114
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,890
You can zoom in if you want, or you
can download this place as it is.

115
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,910
But we're not going to do that now.

116
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,870
Then you can get the data information.

117
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,940
You can see that non null, or
the rows and there's no nil,

118
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,330
null rows or empty colon or rows.

119
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,310
And you can see the data
type of each object.

120
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:37,090
As in, object floats with
number integers, etc. Quickly

121
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,700
you can go on to do your IFIs.

122
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,370
If you want to do exploratory data
analysis you can just go on to do

123
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,110
your exploratory data analysis.

124
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,230
If you want to create a dashboard,
you can go on to create a

125
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,280
dashboard as quick as possible.

126
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,400
Then you can get the row count.

127
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,770
So we have 44 rows and
eight columns in the data.

128
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,870
You can check them.

129
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,910
You can count them here to
confirm that they are correct.

130
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,610
Then descriptive analysis of the
data, as you can see, this gives

131
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,090
the statistical value of the
numerical columns in the data frame.

132
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,120
So other columns are omitted.

133
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,790
You get the counts.

134
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,960
There are 44 rows.

135
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,210
You get the mean of each row, and then
you can compare it to the max easily to

136
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,550
see if your data is, if it's skewed or
there are so many, what is it called?

137
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,150
Appliers in your data.

138
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:30,110
You can get the mean data, the
standard deviation, 25th percentile,

139
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,700
50th percentile, 75th percentile.

140
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,620
straightforward, you can
go on to the dashboard.

141
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:41,940
The dashboard is where I actually find
very interesting because I said auto

142
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,860
use because it's not this closely.

143
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,810
It's actually popular now.

144
00:07:48,245 --> 00:07:53,065
But so many people, especially beginners,
don't really get on to use Plotly because

145
00:07:53,365 --> 00:07:57,615
Matplotlib is a bit easier to get started
on and it's more popular than Plotly.

146
00:07:58,485 --> 00:08:01,555
So I did a little how to use
step for those that are new.

147
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,825
Select your visual from
the options provided.

148
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:06,405
So I have a list of options here.

149
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:11,115
Which I can actually remove
anyone or add anyone as I see fit.

150
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:16,085
So going on the problem something that
a solution here is going with power

151
00:08:16,315 --> 00:08:20,385
bi You just get the random casual
shards that you can use just like

152
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:25,805
here, but you can't really Arturito,
you can go to the, the visuals and

153
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,355
get more visuals, but some are bots.

154
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:34,175
The ones that are not bot aren't really
that good, but here you can just behind

155
00:08:34,195 --> 00:08:37,925
the scene, just write the kind of visuals
you want, put it in and it appears here.

156
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:40,725
So that's how interesting this is.

157
00:08:41,045 --> 00:08:45,585
So get started with, area sharp Get
started with area sharp So getting

158
00:08:45,585 --> 00:08:49,855
started with area sharp It tells you
the exercises So I try to simplify

159
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:54,045
it as much as possible Removing the
numerical value from these exercises So

160
00:08:54,045 --> 00:08:59,450
you don't get an error Say This is the
wrong as is because it's an area shot

161
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,420
or you get a very wrong shot And then
you don't understand what you're doing.

162
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,550
So I simplified it to remove the numerical
value from the exercise So we're going

163
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,540
to start with the region of England and
then for this place You cannot really

164
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,750
use two object coulombs in an area shot.

165
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:19,885
So I removed that as well I removed the
non numerical coulombs as well to make it

166
00:09:19,915 --> 00:09:22,295
easy for beginners to get started on it.

167
00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:24,395
So we'll start with
areas, bombs and acres.

168
00:09:24,895 --> 00:09:28,295
You can add more area shots if you
want, but I'm not going to do that now.

169
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,335
boom, you get your area shot.

170
00:09:30,895 --> 00:09:32,965
Interactive, you can zoom in.

171
00:09:33,465 --> 00:09:37,775
To see all the necessary, shots,
the points, where it says,

172
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,415
Region of England is 3377.

173
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:43,765
You can look at the points, you
can interact with your shots.

174
00:09:44,265 --> 00:09:50,170
You can take a snapshot and then upload
to your PowerPoint to make your slides.

175
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,320
Zoom out.

176
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,480
We go to visualization two.

177
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,520
You click the link, say, pie chart,
which is another of my chart.

178
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,210
Choose the value, just like
the same error in area chart.

179
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,390
I limited it to the value.

180
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:07,740
Let's say, the area would,
oh, let's go with the incident

181
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,380
and then region of England.

182
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,620
You confirm.

183
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,260
You can see you get the incident.

184
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,990
You can see that the ISDA is 15.

185
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,850
2, which is from Southwest.

186
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,050
And then 14.

187
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,950
8, you get your visual.

188
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,870
You get your interactive
charts as fast as possible.

189
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,830
And you get a description on top.

190
00:10:31,525 --> 00:10:35,725
You can download it as well like the
previous chart, or you can continue.

191
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,595
Let's go for the next one.

192
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,325
The next one is, this scatterplot.

193
00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:45,535
With scatterplot, for scatterplot, you
need two columns that are, say, numerical.

194
00:10:45,915 --> 00:10:47,365
And I made sure of that here.

195
00:10:47,865 --> 00:10:53,535
areas, white fire areas, and sometimes
you don't really have to, get two columns.

196
00:10:54,035 --> 00:10:56,425
Choose column to get, so this is an error.

197
00:10:56,805 --> 00:10:58,315
You reset, click on it, you reset.

198
00:10:58,685 --> 00:11:04,735
And then for the other visualization,
say, wire life, And then you go in

199
00:11:04,985 --> 00:11:06,695
and then you get your scatterplot.

200
00:11:06,695 --> 00:11:08,835
Each dot you get to look into each dot.

201
00:11:09,205 --> 00:11:11,135
Let's zoom in to get each dot.

202
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:16,275
You get to look into each dot and
know the key as to why they are there.

203
00:11:16,295 --> 00:11:18,005
We have some outliers in here.

204
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,055
We have some outliers in here.

205
00:11:20,275 --> 00:11:23,005
This is the small area but high fire.

206
00:11:23,285 --> 00:11:26,295
This has a larger area
but low fire duration.

207
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,325
And then we have, the major.

208
00:11:28,825 --> 00:11:29,725
Keys in here.

209
00:11:30,225 --> 00:11:34,365
So moving on, this is, then you can,
but the sweating about this is I

210
00:11:34,365 --> 00:11:37,845
can increase it to visualize five
visualizations, six visualization,

211
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:40,395
seven visualizations down to infinity.

212
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:44,085
And I can reduce it to just one
visualization to make it easier for users.

213
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:48,435
That is the create in about
making an app yourself.

214
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:50,835
it's dynamic to your own taste.

215
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,785
You make the changes as much as you want.

216
00:11:53,385 --> 00:11:59,305
So let's go into, The bar chart, which is
another popular chart, exercise region of

217
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:01,805
England again, or region code, whatever.

218
00:12:02,315 --> 00:12:06,925
And then what have I not done
this and boom, you get it.

219
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,800
Get interaction as well.

220
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:14,420
Get your header, and then you can zoom
in, zoom out, autoscale, whatever.

221
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:19,850
And something I failed, I remember
I failed to do is show you some,

222
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,040
a good feature of this area chart.

223
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,310
Let's say with line chart,
region of England to, area.

224
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,660
Then say you want to compare
two columns together.

225
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,100
You can click on add additional column.

226
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,770
Then you choose an option.

227
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,640
And then the initial column
you actually added is removed,

228
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,940
automatically removed from it.

229
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,010
Then you can say, white file, normal.

230
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,510
You can add as many columns, but
we're going to go with one now.

231
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,560
And voila, you get two columns.

232
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,280
The one that is patented
and different colors.

233
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:55,675
Okay, I made sure to add getness
color to my code to make sure that

234
00:12:55,765 --> 00:12:59,305
every other color is different
and it's interactive as well.

235
00:12:59,615 --> 00:13:02,195
Let's zoom in to check
out the interactivity.

236
00:13:02,555 --> 00:13:05,795
Interactive as well and it tells
you duration of, it gives you keys.

237
00:13:06,465 --> 00:13:08,325
Then you go in, it tells you this.

238
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:17,350
Go in this Understand so so easy and
simple to do can Take a snapshot and

239
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:22,630
continue your analysis or whatever
then go let's go back to the topic

240
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,190
when you're done you can reset
Automatically it comes back, you

241
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,520
get to pick another visualization
and continue as much as possible.

242
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:37,330
we go back to exploratory data
analysis, or you can go to the data

243
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,040
page and come back, depends on you.

244
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:43,070
So for exploratory data analysis,
I made it as easy as possible.

245
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,765
In the dashboard you get to
pick the visualization, do this.

246
00:13:48,025 --> 00:13:52,875
You pick the translation, choose the
column, you draw another as it's a bit

247
00:13:52,895 --> 00:13:55,275
slower than exploratory data analysis.

248
00:13:55,485 --> 00:13:59,055
So the best one, which I put
at the top is Perth Plus.

249
00:13:59,455 --> 00:14:01,445
Clicking on Perth Plus, you
don't have to do anything.

250
00:14:01,665 --> 00:14:05,785
You just click on it and it gives
you the combination of all the

251
00:14:05,785 --> 00:14:07,775
numerical data in your data set.

252
00:14:08,155 --> 00:14:09,455
It compares them together.

253
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:12,415
So you are basically going on it.

254
00:14:12,915 --> 00:14:16,455
, but the without the interactivity of.

255
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:21,140
Plotly, this is, the exploratory data
analysis is powered by Matplotlib.

256
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:27,430
So it does not have the interactivity of
what Plotlib does, but it's almost there.

257
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:31,850
You can see the histogram of each
data, how they compare to each other,

258
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:37,184
the scatter plot of each of them,
the app layers, etc. You can get to

259
00:14:37,184 --> 00:14:39,345
understand your data as fast as possible.

260
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:43,440
Moving on, let's say you want
to do a box plot, click on it.

261
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,390
And when you click on it, it
does not affect the other plot.

262
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,970
It works on its own accord.

263
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,530
Everything is separate from each other.

264
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,580
Even though they're together.

265
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,390
I try to separate them from
each other as much as I could.

266
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:02,890
So going on the bus plot here, you choose
the region you want, automatically it

267
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:08,980
gets the first region and get to make your
analysis with both blood on both blood.

268
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,240
You can zoom in.

269
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:17,030
If you want zoom out, you can
move on to say, count blood.

270
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:23,320
We want to count the amount of the row or
the column, especially you have, this has

271
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,690
already done the region of England for us.

272
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:29,210
You can count, say, the number,
which is not really visible to count.

273
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,610
Let's say region code.

274
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,390
So magically it's loose and voila.

275
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,360
It's out.

276
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,030
You can see, sorry, it's almost with
lowest with this and then the highest

277
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,300
is E to F, and then line chart.

278
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,160
Unlike the interactive
dashboard, you don't get to

279
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,740
put as many lines as possible.

280
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,620
You just need this for your visualization.

281
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,870
Again, it does it automatically
and then you can then choose any

282
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,560
other visualization you want.

283
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,480
It loads and.

284
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:58,660
Boom.

285
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,680
Changes.

286
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:04,970
And then you can change again, say
wildlife incident number, loads,

287
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:05,940
changes.

288
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,020
So it's as easy as that.

289
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,940
That is the end of how this app works.

290
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,620
When you have time, if you are really
interested, you can message me and

291
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:20,360
then we can probably work together and
I will try and increase the works of.

292
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,760
We can increase the,
functionalities in it.

293
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,430
And then let's go on how
the app actually works.

294
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:33,240
you can fork this app on Github,
and get started, make the

295
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,600
edits, and I will accept it.

296
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:35,970
can work together.

297
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,790
Let's go how I created this thing.

298
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:39,870
home.

299
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,330
And, I added this connect
to me on LinkedIn.

300
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,200
And the GitHub repo.

301
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,620
We'll go on to the GitHub repo now.

302
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,350
This is the main repo.

303
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,990
And then we have the dashboard.

304
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,550
Python dashboard.

305
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:53,400
Data.

306
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:53,710
py.

307
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,630
Here you can upload the data.

308
00:16:56,135 --> 00:16:57,865
Exploratory data analysis.

309
00:16:58,315 --> 00:17:04,335
The error handler to make sure that
we don't get errors from lagging or

310
00:17:04,575 --> 00:17:07,355
unexpected errors from using the app.

311
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:10,265
Then the py and then visualization.

312
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,890
py where all the
visualizations actually happen.

313
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,810
So let's start with the data.

314
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:15,710
py.

315
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,410
Pandas, obviously.

316
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:21,200
Pandas is the most popular
data analytics library.

317
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,640
We have DAX, but I think Pandas is
easy to learn, and it's very popular,

318
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,880
so as a beginner, and an enthusiast
into data analysis, it's the first.

319
00:17:31,735 --> 00:17:35,195
Library you should let get
started on with stream leads.

320
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:39,335
Whatever I uploaded there then
luckily with Streamly it as you

321
00:17:39,335 --> 00:17:46,535
can apply CSS to your app, which is
what these stuffs that are in here

322
00:17:47,135 --> 00:17:49,925
CSS to beautify the page though.

323
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,795
I'm not really good with CSS.

324
00:17:51,995 --> 00:17:56,500
I confess But I tried my best to
make sure that It's easy to read.

325
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,080
The functionalities
are easy to understand.

326
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,270
And moving on, let's cut the shot.

327
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:10,710
So navigation, the navigation,
which is in here, just at the top

328
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,500
of the screen, get to navigate it.

329
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,600
And, yeah, that is it.

330
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,730
And then main, this is
where I applied, apply CSS.

331
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,210
I called the apply CSS.

332
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,460
Down here and then let's
get on to the data.

333
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:30,290
This is the part for both Sample data
that we use is on my GitHub repo as well.

334
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,630
You can check it out if you want.

335
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,145
It's right at The sample data path.

336
00:18:35,395 --> 00:18:36,505
So this is it.

337
00:18:36,855 --> 00:18:37,625
There's text.

338
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:41,415
xls but I didn't add it
to the what is it called?

339
00:18:41,905 --> 00:18:43,415
The codes.

340
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:44,945
So going back in here.

341
00:18:44,945 --> 00:18:49,405
Give me a minute.

342
00:18:49,905 --> 00:18:54,375
Navigate to page name, you can N
Navigate, which is Session State Power.

343
00:18:54,525 --> 00:18:58,455
We stream that is session state, which
when you navigate it automatically

344
00:18:58,455 --> 00:19:00,575
goes down to the app, the page.

345
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:04,925
You want all within the same page,
like you don't have to load and go onto

346
00:19:04,925 --> 00:19:09,305
another page like Abnormal Browser,
but with Session State, you get to

347
00:19:09,455 --> 00:19:12,365
go to any page within the same page.

348
00:19:12,865 --> 00:19:18,965
going down to the radio option with
streamleads is, let me show you.

349
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:24,775
this is the radio option,
upload data or sample data.

350
00:19:25,275 --> 00:19:26,515
This is the radio option.

351
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:30,555
And then I did a logical statement here.

352
00:19:30,635 --> 00:19:37,245
If the data is, if there is uploaded
data, then file uploaded is false.

353
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,165
You pick the option is false.

354
00:19:39,455 --> 00:19:44,085
If not, then gives you the option to
upload this particular data and the type.

355
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:45,775
So I specified the type.

356
00:19:46,105 --> 00:19:47,245
It has to be in CSV.

357
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:53,360
In JC, in Excel, both Excel,
old and new Excel, data.

358
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,670
If you don't have to upload your data,
then the other option is using, use

359
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,790
sample data, like I just showed you.

360
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,460
And you can pick the data either
fire data Employee data and all

361
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,910
that you have a really good to
understand it better So I don't waste

362
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,970
so many time with employee data.

363
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:17,450
I made sure that the date and time
The date column I turn them to I

364
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:21,380
Make sure they are in this column
so you don't get errors with it.

365
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,700
And I think with upload data You
can actually automatically all date

366
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,700
columns in your data automatically
using pandas dateTime function.

367
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,790
I made sure compress all of them to
date and time so you don't get error.

368
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,400
You can work with your
data as fast as possible.

369
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,380
Then after you get the tabulation, the
data information, the data preview, the

370
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:49,090
colon row account and the descriptive
analysis, guest flow retreat.

371
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,470
Eda.

372
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:56,920
py Again now I use matplotlib
as pyplus and seaborn as sns.

373
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,790
Seaborn beautifies matplotlib.

374
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,990
So for say dashboard.

375
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,990
okay, dashboard is connected
from visualization.

376
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:09,940
For dashboard, I use Plotly
as express and Plotly.

377
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,360
grabobject as go to give
it its interactivity of.

378
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:19,880
So at least you can check
them out at your free time.

379
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,600
But I can't really go
through all the codes now.

380
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,970
So going back to my demo overview.

381
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,680
So basically, you see how
smooth in between sections were.

382
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,450
Now the technologies I use,
obviously I use Python, which is

383
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,360
the obvious one, but for the backend
development, everything I developed

384
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,930
was based on, entirely on Python.

385
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:47,130
Then Streamlit, I hosted the stuff on, I
used Streamlit, powered, Codes and then

386
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:53,990
I will set it on the Streamlit cloud
where that's why sometimes it takes A few

387
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:59,530
seconds to load because it's actually free
as the good thing about Streamlit is free

388
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:04,360
You don't have to pay to actually get into
it like Instagram, for example It loads

389
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:09,520
and oh, I forgot to show Instagram with
Instagram You can select the bins you want

390
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:18,740
normally when I do my coding I put it at
100, 100 bins, and then this is 100 bins.

391
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,560
Let's increase it to 200.

392
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:25,290
Oh, I think there's something,
there's an issue with this.

393
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,320
Let's get a good numerical data.

394
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,550
And, boom, you get your,
say, added, KDE line.

395
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,860
So let's go on to 100 pins.

396
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,150
Then, reduce this.

397
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:41,170
And we see that the data
are not really together.

398
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:46,440
So you have a lot of outliers in here
between, from 4, 000 to 10, 000, you

399
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:51,670
have a lot of outliers and then the
data was most of them are in 2000.

400
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:56,710
For areas, for wildlife incident
number, let's start with that.

401
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:00,380
Say it's skewed to the left, even
though there are outliers, but fewer

402
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,870
ones than, the area, areas burnt.

403
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,350
Then you can say this is
skewed exactly to the left.

404
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:12,200
Let's do it this way, increases the bin,
or reduces the bin as much as you can.

405
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:19,490
that will be, that is the how it works
to Streamlit, and all my visuals, I

406
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:25,180
use Matplotlib, I use Plotly, I use
Seaborn, and I use Plotly Express, all

407
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:30,540
inside Plotly, as Plotly to actually
make it as interactive as possible.

408
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,050
Then I deployed it on Streamlit, Cloud.

409
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:38,540
lesson learned, the key thing that
I learned is that You can actually

410
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:41,660
build anything with programming.

411
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,850
Any app that is out there has
been built by something, and

412
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,570
you can actually build it again.

413
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:53,480
Though it might not be as high, as
big, or as developed, or as modern

414
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,100
as the app that is being maintained.

415
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,970
Because people get paid to do it.

416
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,280
But you can actually build
something within your own

417
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,640
confines, within your own comfort.

418
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,510
And make it work.

419
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:08,350
you can get user importance of user
friendly design and interactivity.

420
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:13,780
And the I it handled though I didn't show
it, but the app, I've tested it before.

421
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:18,580
You can handle it more larger
data sets, not just 47 columns.

422
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:25,500
It can add up to 30 equals and about
500 rows for future enhancement.

423
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,660
I'm planning on looking to add.

424
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,070
Machine learning for
machine learning features.

425
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,890
So you can just come in, say you want
to do Random forest regression, you

426
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:39,360
can just click on random forest just
like the bus plot and then put in

427
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,650
the extreme wide train tests and then
do your regression analysis or you

428
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:50,915
can do Sg, boost your stream, graded
boost analysis or your classification,

429
00:24:51,425 --> 00:24:55,055
random forward classification, A TC,
looking to add them in the near future.

430
00:24:55,805 --> 00:25:00,005
And then I'll increase support for
adding even data set of up to a million.

431
00:25:00,005 --> 00:25:03,455
But I think that should depend on
the cloud, on the Stream D cloud

432
00:25:03,815 --> 00:25:05,495
and how effective it's going to be.

433
00:25:05,495 --> 00:25:07,415
I think this is the end of my.

434
00:25:07,915 --> 00:25:11,725
Talk, virtualization and
every other thing, my slides.

435
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:15,825
If you have any question, you
can reach out to me via LinkedIn.

436
00:25:16,705 --> 00:25:17,435
And if you have.

437
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:22,055
advice or suggestions for me,
you can reach out to me as well.

438
00:25:22,435 --> 00:25:27,565
On final note, I'd like to say thank
you to CORE42 for allowing me to

439
00:25:27,565 --> 00:25:32,505
display my help to people out there
and I want to say a huge thank you

440
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:39,105
to my family and thank you all for
actually watching the video and my talk.

441
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:40,535
See you next time.

442
00:25:41,286 --> 00:25:41,996
Hello, everyone.

443
00:25:42,506 --> 00:25:47,886
My name is Daniel, and, I'm a data
specialist, or I like to call myself.

444
00:25:48,226 --> 00:25:52,176
I revolve around the data analysis,
machine learning, and even as far

445
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,756
to natural language processing.

446
00:25:54,116 --> 00:25:56,516
Also, I'm a data mentor
and a programming mentor.

447
00:25:57,206 --> 00:25:59,926
I tend to assist people that are
looking to get on the data space

448
00:26:00,246 --> 00:26:01,866
and also on the programming space.

449
00:26:02,216 --> 00:26:06,016
Today, I'll be speaking on
DataSense, DataCentric, which

450
00:26:06,016 --> 00:26:08,836
I shortened to DataSense, an
app that I built from scratch.

451
00:26:08,836 --> 00:26:08,896
Thank you.

452
00:26:09,406 --> 00:26:12,656
Using fully on the streamlit
framework in Python.

453
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:17,526
I'll be giving a live demo of the
app and I'm going to get started.

454
00:26:18,026 --> 00:26:18,976
Turn this on.

455
00:26:19,876 --> 00:26:20,616
Here we go.

456
00:26:21,116 --> 00:26:24,576
So data analytics with Streamly by me.

457
00:26:24,576 --> 00:26:29,486
DataSense, I have been using Power BI.

458
00:26:29,536 --> 00:26:32,106
I've been using a tab
view, but mostly Power BI.

459
00:26:32,406 --> 00:26:36,226
And I realized that you cannot really
get logged in with Power BI if you

460
00:26:36,226 --> 00:26:37,916
don't have an organization on email.

461
00:26:38,206 --> 00:26:43,696
for people, beginners that are just new
to the field, that does not know anything

462
00:26:43,706 --> 00:26:49,586
about programming or analytical analysis,
they can't just get in Power BI if

463
00:26:49,586 --> 00:26:51,606
they don't have, for example, students.

464
00:26:52,016 --> 00:26:55,476
I felt like this is a very
major constraint for those

465
00:26:55,516 --> 00:26:57,466
learning from my own experience.

466
00:26:57,476 --> 00:26:59,196
I felt like I should create a hub.

467
00:26:59,481 --> 00:27:03,031
That will be easy for them
to use a learning curve for

468
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:04,451
them and for me as well.

469
00:27:04,741 --> 00:27:07,511
So I did so many research
and I came up with Datasense.

470
00:27:08,011 --> 00:27:12,331
So it's a Python powered solution
for data exploration, visualization.

471
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:17,101
It simplifies the whole process
of analysis, starting from

472
00:27:17,861 --> 00:27:21,471
putting, uploading your data
down to creating a visualization.

473
00:27:21,831 --> 00:27:25,271
It's a very straightforward, I made
it as straightforward as possible,

474
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:27,491
making, analyzing the data set.

475
00:27:27,581 --> 00:27:30,571
and it's encouraging,
encourages self learning.

476
00:27:31,181 --> 00:27:35,601
So I found some problems, and I
created a solution with data science.

477
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,851
I found that manual data
analysis is time consuming.

478
00:27:39,351 --> 00:27:44,121
When you get your data into Power
BI, it's on you to actually pick the

479
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,686
one that has to be on the X axis.

480
00:27:46,996 --> 00:27:50,026
And when you put it in, it gives
you error without really telling you

481
00:27:50,026 --> 00:27:51,986
that, oh, this is the wrong data.

482
00:27:52,126 --> 00:27:55,736
This is the wrong column
to put into this as is.

483
00:27:56,236 --> 00:28:02,746
And it's so time consuming, error prone,
and many of them are non user friendly.

484
00:28:03,326 --> 00:28:06,576
Especially for learners that are
trying to get on the platform.

485
00:28:06,766 --> 00:28:10,136
You have to go through probably learning
via Udemy or something to actually

486
00:28:10,376 --> 00:28:12,356
understand the app as it is built.

487
00:28:12,366 --> 00:28:18,506
So I solved this problem by creating a
very straightforward interface that you

488
00:28:18,506 --> 00:28:22,986
get your data in, takes you directly
to the data, you make your analysis,

489
00:28:23,436 --> 00:28:25,476
and you're out as simple as possible.

490
00:28:25,476 --> 00:28:28,476
I added an interactive dashboard
session powered with Plotly.

491
00:28:28,896 --> 00:28:34,149
Plotly is a visualization library
on Python that gets you more

492
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:40,481
information on the data compared
to the most popular Matplotlib.

493
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:45,381
Engineers that don't want to
start making so many analysis,

494
00:28:45,381 --> 00:28:46,571
writing the codes and all that.

495
00:28:46,901 --> 00:28:50,761
I did an exploratory data analysis for
them that you can just click on the

496
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:54,121
chart and you get your analysis done.

497
00:28:54,161 --> 00:28:55,981
And you know the context of your data.

498
00:28:56,311 --> 00:29:00,561
You know the skew at which your
numerical data, where it's aligned to.

499
00:29:01,061 --> 00:29:05,821
You get your analysis and you go on
further to do your machine learning code.

500
00:29:06,001 --> 00:29:10,051
So some of the key features,
the major features of the app

501
00:29:10,051 --> 00:29:12,051
is data upload by management.

502
00:29:12,361 --> 00:29:16,961
You have the option to upload CSV
file, most common CSV upload JSON

503
00:29:16,961 --> 00:29:21,201
and you can upload Excel spreadsheet,
and then you can get sample data

504
00:29:21,201 --> 00:29:26,301
from that and quickly go on to get
descriptive analysis of your data.

505
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:30,091
You can get the, as many, how many
columns are in your data, how many

506
00:29:30,091 --> 00:29:33,791
rows, and you can get the statistic
measure of your data, the mean, the

507
00:29:33,801 --> 00:29:36,041
mode, the mean, the standard deviation.

508
00:29:36,981 --> 00:29:40,622
The 21st, 25th percentile and whatnot.

509
00:29:40,902 --> 00:29:43,892
Then you can go to the automated
exploratory data analysis

510
00:29:43,922 --> 00:29:45,222
that I mentioned just now.

511
00:29:45,722 --> 00:29:49,812
You can get, you can just click on the
chart and do your post plot analysis.

512
00:29:50,072 --> 00:29:52,761
Or probably you want to
check, the count plot.

513
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:57,362
How many of this, say cities are in
your data, you can check it easily

514
00:29:57,882 --> 00:30:00,592
and then you can do your dashboard.

515
00:30:00,652 --> 00:30:05,572
You can get, create a dashboard
with up to four, four different

516
00:30:05,572 --> 00:30:07,042
graphs, four different shots.

517
00:30:07,677 --> 00:30:10,117
with as many graphs as possible.

518
00:30:10,617 --> 00:30:16,047
So now I'm going to log up onto
the app so I can show you the

519
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,997
demo of how everything works.

520
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:19,847
Let's get started.

521
00:30:20,347 --> 00:30:22,837
So here we are, this is the app.

522
00:30:23,337 --> 00:30:25,797
data sent, everything
here was written by me.

523
00:30:26,197 --> 00:30:32,767
I wrote everything with the emojis
and the, and the, the fonts.

524
00:30:33,247 --> 00:30:35,127
So data analysts are short on time.

525
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:37,377
Quickly go to the data page
and test the functionality.

526
00:30:37,787 --> 00:30:40,947
Actually now, at the forefront,
you get the navigation.

527
00:30:41,277 --> 00:30:43,327
This is where you can go to the data page.

528
00:30:44,027 --> 00:30:45,637
Data page, upload your data.

529
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:48,207
You can go to, the dashboard.

530
00:30:48,207 --> 00:30:49,097
There's no data yet.

531
00:30:49,387 --> 00:30:51,487
So it tells you that
no data set available.

532
00:30:51,867 --> 00:30:52,157
Please.

533
00:30:52,552 --> 00:30:56,952
Go back, click on this link, the
data page, to go upload the data.

534
00:30:57,652 --> 00:31:01,272
Then you can also go to the
exploratory dashboards analysis,

535
00:31:01,272 --> 00:31:02,392
which tells you the same thing.

536
00:31:02,802 --> 00:31:04,732
Go to the data page, which we will do now.

537
00:31:05,232 --> 00:31:07,092
Here you have two options, upload data.

538
00:31:07,392 --> 00:31:10,232
Just browse your files, you
can upload your data locally.

539
00:31:11,147 --> 00:31:14,197
And, put your data in here,
the one you want to analyze.

540
00:31:14,577 --> 00:31:17,727
Or, you can use my sample
data just to test the app out,

541
00:31:17,727 --> 00:31:18,817
which I'm going to do now.

542
00:31:19,637 --> 00:31:21,487
These stuffs, you can
read them if you want.

543
00:31:21,517 --> 00:31:24,717
It's just a quick guide on how
the app works, but we're not going

544
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,347
to go through reading them now.

545
00:31:26,847 --> 00:31:28,077
Because I'll be doing the demo.

546
00:31:28,077 --> 00:31:29,617
And then you can pick data.

547
00:31:30,117 --> 00:31:34,037
Yeah, you can pick FHIR data or
you can pick employee data, depends

548
00:31:34,037 --> 00:31:35,587
on which you want to test out.

549
00:31:35,597 --> 00:31:39,237
We'll go with the FHIR data first,
and then it loads successfully.

550
00:31:39,557 --> 00:31:43,217
The beginning, it gives you everything
about the data, the top five rules.

551
00:31:43,607 --> 00:31:46,717
This is akin to writing pandas.

552
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:47,507
head.

553
00:31:47,797 --> 00:31:49,257
So this is the code, pandas.

554
00:31:49,427 --> 00:31:52,167
head, bracket five is the
code behind this stuff.

555
00:31:52,557 --> 00:31:57,787
You can zoom in if you want, or you
can download this place as it is.

556
00:31:58,177 --> 00:31:59,807
But we're not going to do that now.

557
00:32:00,117 --> 00:32:01,767
Then you can get the data information.

558
00:32:01,767 --> 00:32:06,837
You can see that non null, or
the rows and there's no nil,

559
00:32:06,957 --> 00:32:09,227
null rows or empty colon or rows.

560
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:12,207
And you can see the data
type of each object.

561
00:32:12,707 --> 00:32:17,987
As in, object floats with
number integers, etc. Quickly

562
00:32:18,127 --> 00:32:20,597
you can go on to do your IFIs.

563
00:32:20,597 --> 00:32:24,267
If you want to do exploratory data
analysis you can just go on to do

564
00:32:24,267 --> 00:32:26,007
your exploratory data analysis.

565
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:29,127
If you want to create a dashboard,
you can go on to create a

566
00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:31,177
dashboard as quick as possible.

567
00:32:31,787 --> 00:32:33,297
Then you can get the row count.

568
00:32:33,797 --> 00:32:37,667
So we have 44 rows and
eight columns in the data.

569
00:32:37,697 --> 00:32:38,767
You can check them.

570
00:32:38,797 --> 00:32:41,807
You can count them here to
confirm that they are correct.

571
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:46,507
Then descriptive analysis of the
data, as you can see, this gives

572
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:49,987
the statistical value of the
numerical columns in the data frame.

573
00:32:50,287 --> 00:32:52,017
So other columns are omitted.

574
00:32:52,857 --> 00:32:53,687
You get the counts.

575
00:32:53,687 --> 00:32:54,857
There are 44 rows.

576
00:32:55,357 --> 00:33:00,107
You get the mean of each row, and then
you can compare it to the max easily to

577
00:33:00,117 --> 00:33:04,447
see if your data is, if it's skewed or
there are so many, what is it called?

578
00:33:04,717 --> 00:33:06,047
Appliers in your data.

579
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:11,007
You can get the mean data, the
standard deviation, 25th percentile,

580
00:33:11,087 --> 00:33:14,597
50th percentile, 75th percentile.

581
00:33:15,017 --> 00:33:17,517
straightforward, you can
go on to the dashboard.

582
00:33:17,517 --> 00:33:22,837
The dashboard is where I actually find
very interesting because I said auto

583
00:33:22,837 --> 00:33:25,757
use because it's not this closely.

584
00:33:26,057 --> 00:33:28,707
It's actually popular now.

585
00:33:29,142 --> 00:33:33,962
But so many people, especially beginners,
don't really get on to use Plotly because

586
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:38,512
Matplotlib is a bit easier to get started
on and it's more popular than Plotly.

587
00:33:39,382 --> 00:33:42,452
So I did a little how to use
step for those that are new.

588
00:33:42,772 --> 00:33:44,722
Select your visual from
the options provided.

589
00:33:45,042 --> 00:33:47,302
So I have a list of options here.

590
00:33:47,672 --> 00:33:52,012
Which I can actually remove
anyone or add anyone as I see fit.

591
00:33:52,262 --> 00:33:56,982
So going on the problem something that
a solution here is going with power

592
00:33:57,212 --> 00:34:01,282
bi You just get the random casual
shards that you can use just like

593
00:34:01,362 --> 00:34:06,702
here, but you can't really Arturito,
you can go to the, the visuals and

594
00:34:06,702 --> 00:34:09,252
get more visuals, but some are bots.

595
00:34:09,412 --> 00:34:15,072
The ones that are not bot aren't really
that good, but here you can just behind

596
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:18,822
the scene, just write the kind of visuals
you want, put it in and it appears here.

597
00:34:19,032 --> 00:34:21,622
So that's how interesting this is.

598
00:34:21,942 --> 00:34:26,482
So get started with, area sharp Get
started with area sharp So getting

599
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:30,752
started with area sharp It tells you
the exercises So I try to simplify

600
00:34:30,922 --> 00:34:34,942
it as much as possible Removing the
numerical value from these exercises So

601
00:34:34,942 --> 00:34:40,347
you don't get an error Say This is the
wrong as is because it's an area shot

602
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:44,317
or you get a very wrong shot And then
you don't understand what you're doing.

603
00:34:44,687 --> 00:34:48,447
So I simplified it to remove the numerical
value from the exercise So we're going

604
00:34:48,447 --> 00:34:52,437
to start with the region of England and
then for this place You cannot really

605
00:34:52,447 --> 00:34:55,647
use two object coulombs in an area shot.

606
00:34:55,727 --> 00:35:00,782
So I removed that as well I removed the
non numerical coulombs as well to make it

607
00:35:00,812 --> 00:35:03,192
easy for beginners to get started on it.

608
00:35:03,452 --> 00:35:05,292
So we'll start with
areas, bombs and acres.

609
00:35:05,792 --> 00:35:09,192
You can add more area shots if you
want, but I'm not going to do that now.

610
00:35:09,432 --> 00:35:11,232
boom, you get your area shot.

611
00:35:11,792 --> 00:35:13,862
Interactive, you can zoom in.

612
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:18,672
To see all the necessary, shots,
the points, where it says,

613
00:35:18,932 --> 00:35:21,312
Region of England is 3377.

614
00:35:21,812 --> 00:35:24,662
You can look at the points, you
can interact with your shots.

615
00:35:25,162 --> 00:35:31,067
You can take a snapshot and then upload
to your PowerPoint to make your slides.

616
00:35:31,567 --> 00:35:32,217
Zoom out.

617
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,377
We go to visualization two.

618
00:35:35,027 --> 00:35:38,417
You click the link, say, pie chart,
which is another of my chart.

619
00:35:38,897 --> 00:35:42,107
Choose the value, just like
the same error in area chart.

620
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:44,287
I limited it to the value.

621
00:35:44,287 --> 00:35:48,637
Let's say, the area would,
oh, let's go with the incident

622
00:35:49,137 --> 00:35:51,277
and then region of England.

623
00:35:51,777 --> 00:35:52,517
You confirm.

624
00:35:53,397 --> 00:35:55,157
You can see you get the incident.

625
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:56,887
You can see that the ISDA is 15.

626
00:35:57,117 --> 00:35:59,747
2, which is from Southwest.

627
00:36:00,297 --> 00:36:00,946
And then 14.

628
00:36:00,947 --> 00:36:02,847
8, you get your visual.

629
00:36:02,937 --> 00:36:08,767
You get your interactive
charts as fast as possible.

630
00:36:09,057 --> 00:36:11,727
And you get a description on top.

631
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:16,622
You can download it as well like the
previous chart, or you can continue.

632
00:36:16,932 --> 00:36:18,492
Let's go for the next one.

633
00:36:18,592 --> 00:36:20,222
The next one is, this scatterplot.

634
00:36:20,582 --> 00:36:26,432
With scatterplot, for scatterplot, you
need two columns that are, say, numerical.

635
00:36:26,812 --> 00:36:28,262
And I made sure of that here.

636
00:36:28,762 --> 00:36:34,432
areas, white fire areas, and sometimes
you don't really have to, get two columns.

637
00:36:34,932 --> 00:36:37,322
Choose column to get, so this is an error.

638
00:36:37,702 --> 00:36:39,212
You reset, click on it, you reset.

639
00:36:39,582 --> 00:36:45,632
And then for the other visualization,
say, wire life, And then you go in

640
00:36:45,882 --> 00:36:47,592
and then you get your scatterplot.

641
00:36:47,592 --> 00:36:49,732
Each dot you get to look into each dot.

642
00:36:50,102 --> 00:36:52,032
Let's zoom in to get each dot.

643
00:36:52,042 --> 00:36:57,172
You get to look into each dot and
know the key as to why they are there.

644
00:36:57,192 --> 00:36:58,902
We have some outliers in here.

645
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,952
We have some outliers in here.

646
00:37:01,172 --> 00:37:03,902
This is the small area but high fire.

647
00:37:04,182 --> 00:37:07,192
This has a larger area
but low fire duration.

648
00:37:07,522 --> 00:37:09,222
And then we have, the major.

649
00:37:09,722 --> 00:37:10,622
Keys in here.

650
00:37:11,122 --> 00:37:15,262
So moving on, this is, then you can,
but the sweating about this is I

651
00:37:15,262 --> 00:37:18,742
can increase it to visualize five
visualizations, six visualization,

652
00:37:18,982 --> 00:37:21,292
seven visualizations down to infinity.

653
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:24,982
And I can reduce it to just one
visualization to make it easier for users.

654
00:37:25,252 --> 00:37:29,332
That is the create in about
making an app yourself.

655
00:37:29,692 --> 00:37:31,732
it's dynamic to your own taste.

656
00:37:31,732 --> 00:37:33,682
You make the changes as much as you want.

657
00:37:34,282 --> 00:37:40,202
So let's go into, The bar chart, which is
another popular chart, exercise region of

658
00:37:40,262 --> 00:37:42,702
England again, or region code, whatever.

659
00:37:43,212 --> 00:37:47,822
And then what have I not done
this and boom, you get it.

660
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:49,697
Get interaction as well.

661
00:37:50,147 --> 00:37:55,317
Get your header, and then you can zoom
in, zoom out, autoscale, whatever.

662
00:37:55,647 --> 00:38:00,747
And something I failed, I remember
I failed to do is show you some,

663
00:38:01,247 --> 00:38:02,937
a good feature of this area chart.

664
00:38:03,277 --> 00:38:07,207
Let's say with line chart,
region of England to, area.

665
00:38:07,707 --> 00:38:10,557
Then say you want to compare
two columns together.

666
00:38:11,067 --> 00:38:12,997
You can click on add additional column.

667
00:38:13,487 --> 00:38:14,667
Then you choose an option.

668
00:38:15,317 --> 00:38:18,537
And then the initial column
you actually added is removed,

669
00:38:18,537 --> 00:38:19,837
automatically removed from it.

670
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:21,907
Then you can say, white file, normal.

671
00:38:22,157 --> 00:38:25,407
You can add as many columns, but
we're going to go with one now.

672
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:29,457
And voila, you get two columns.

673
00:38:29,517 --> 00:38:32,177
The one that is patented
and different colors.

674
00:38:32,752 --> 00:38:36,572
Okay, I made sure to add getness
color to my code to make sure that

675
00:38:36,662 --> 00:38:40,202
every other color is different
and it's interactive as well.

676
00:38:40,512 --> 00:38:43,092
Let's zoom in to check
out the interactivity.

677
00:38:43,452 --> 00:38:46,692
Interactive as well and it tells
you duration of, it gives you keys.

678
00:38:47,362 --> 00:38:49,222
Then you go in, it tells you this.

679
00:38:49,817 --> 00:38:58,247
Go in this Understand so so easy and
simple to do can Take a snapshot and

680
00:38:58,317 --> 00:39:03,527
continue your analysis or whatever
then go let's go back to the topic

681
00:39:03,557 --> 00:39:07,087
when you're done you can reset
Automatically it comes back, you

682
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:11,417
get to pick another visualization
and continue as much as possible.

683
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:18,227
we go back to exploratory data
analysis, or you can go to the data

684
00:39:18,227 --> 00:39:19,937
page and come back, depends on you.

685
00:39:20,207 --> 00:39:23,967
So for exploratory data analysis,
I made it as easy as possible.

686
00:39:24,807 --> 00:39:28,661
In the dashboard you get to
pick the visualization, do this.

687
00:39:28,922 --> 00:39:33,772
You pick the translation, choose the
column, you draw another as it's a bit

688
00:39:33,792 --> 00:39:36,172
slower than exploratory data analysis.

689
00:39:36,382 --> 00:39:39,952
So the best one, which I put
at the top is Perth Plus.

690
00:39:40,352 --> 00:39:42,342
Clicking on Perth Plus, you
don't have to do anything.

691
00:39:42,562 --> 00:39:46,682
You just click on it and it gives
you the combination of all the

692
00:39:46,682 --> 00:39:48,672
numerical data in your data set.

693
00:39:49,052 --> 00:39:50,352
It compares them together.

694
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:53,312
So you are basically going on it.

695
00:39:53,812 --> 00:39:57,352
, but the without the interactivity of.

696
00:39:57,967 --> 00:40:02,037
Plotly, this is, the exploratory data
analysis is powered by Matplotlib.

697
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:08,327
So it does not have the interactivity of
what Plotlib does, but it's almost there.

698
00:40:08,547 --> 00:40:12,747
You can see the histogram of each
data, how they compare to each other,

699
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:18,081
the scatter plot of each of them,
the app layers, etc. You can get to

700
00:40:18,081 --> 00:40:20,242
understand your data as fast as possible.

701
00:40:20,242 --> 00:40:24,337
Moving on, let's say you want
to do a box plot, click on it.

702
00:40:24,837 --> 00:40:28,287
And when you click on it, it
does not affect the other plot.

703
00:40:28,347 --> 00:40:30,867
It works on its own accord.

704
00:40:30,867 --> 00:40:32,427
Everything is separate from each other.

705
00:40:32,427 --> 00:40:33,477
Even though they're together.

706
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:37,287
I try to separate them from
each other as much as I could.

707
00:40:37,787 --> 00:40:43,787
So going on the bus plot here, you choose
the region you want, automatically it

708
00:40:43,787 --> 00:40:49,877
gets the first region and get to make your
analysis with both blood on both blood.

709
00:40:50,237 --> 00:40:51,137
You can zoom in.

710
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:57,927
If you want zoom out, you can
move on to say, count blood.

711
00:40:58,197 --> 00:41:04,217
We want to count the amount of the row or
the column, especially you have, this has

712
00:41:04,217 --> 00:41:06,587
already done the region of England for us.

713
00:41:06,917 --> 00:41:10,107
You can count, say, the number,
which is not really visible to count.

714
00:41:10,387 --> 00:41:11,507
Let's say region code.

715
00:41:12,007 --> 00:41:15,287
So magically it's loose and voila.

716
00:41:15,817 --> 00:41:16,257
It's out.

717
00:41:16,757 --> 00:41:20,927
You can see, sorry, it's almost with
lowest with this and then the highest

718
00:41:20,977 --> 00:41:24,197
is E to F, and then line chart.

719
00:41:24,307 --> 00:41:28,057
Unlike the interactive
dashboard, you don't get to

720
00:41:28,057 --> 00:41:29,637
put as many lines as possible.

721
00:41:29,637 --> 00:41:31,517
You just need this for your visualization.

722
00:41:31,817 --> 00:41:35,767
Again, it does it automatically
and then you can then choose any

723
00:41:35,837 --> 00:41:37,457
other visualization you want.

724
00:41:37,467 --> 00:41:38,377
It loads and.

725
00:41:39,307 --> 00:41:39,557
Boom.

726
00:41:40,057 --> 00:41:40,577
Changes.

727
00:41:40,987 --> 00:41:45,867
And then you can change again, say
wildlife incident number, loads,

728
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:46,837
changes.

729
00:41:47,177 --> 00:41:48,917
So it's as easy as that.

730
00:41:49,637 --> 00:41:52,837
That is the end of how this app works.

731
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:57,517
When you have time, if you are really
interested, you can message me and

732
00:41:57,527 --> 00:42:01,257
then we can probably work together and
I will try and increase the works of.

733
00:42:01,757 --> 00:42:04,657
We can increase the,
functionalities in it.

734
00:42:05,297 --> 00:42:09,327
And then let's go on how
the app actually works.

735
00:42:09,747 --> 00:42:14,137
you can fork this app on Github,
and get started, make the

736
00:42:14,167 --> 00:42:15,497
edits, and I will accept it.

737
00:42:16,047 --> 00:42:16,867
can work together.

738
00:42:17,177 --> 00:42:19,687
Let's go how I created this thing.

739
00:42:20,367 --> 00:42:20,767
home.

740
00:42:21,717 --> 00:42:24,227
And, I added this connect
to me on LinkedIn.

741
00:42:24,727 --> 00:42:26,097
And the GitHub repo.

742
00:42:26,797 --> 00:42:28,517
We'll go on to the GitHub repo now.

743
00:42:29,017 --> 00:42:30,247
This is the main repo.

744
00:42:30,367 --> 00:42:31,887
And then we have the dashboard.

745
00:42:32,387 --> 00:42:33,447
Python dashboard.

746
00:42:34,037 --> 00:42:34,297
Data.

747
00:42:34,297 --> 00:42:34,607
py.

748
00:42:35,227 --> 00:42:36,527
Here you can upload the data.

749
00:42:37,032 --> 00:42:38,762
Exploratory data analysis.

750
00:42:39,212 --> 00:42:45,232
The error handler to make sure that
we don't get errors from lagging or

751
00:42:45,472 --> 00:42:48,252
unexpected errors from using the app.

752
00:42:48,572 --> 00:42:51,162
Then the py and then visualization.

753
00:42:51,627 --> 00:42:53,787
py where all the
visualizations actually happen.

754
00:42:54,157 --> 00:42:55,707
So let's start with the data.

755
00:42:56,137 --> 00:42:56,607
py.

756
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:58,307
Pandas, obviously.

757
00:42:58,967 --> 00:43:02,097
Pandas is the most popular
data analytics library.

758
00:43:02,097 --> 00:43:06,537
We have DAX, but I think Pandas is
easy to learn, and it's very popular,

759
00:43:06,787 --> 00:43:11,777
so as a beginner, and an enthusiast
into data analysis, it's the first.

760
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:16,092
Library you should let get
started on with stream leads.

761
00:43:16,092 --> 00:43:20,232
Whatever I uploaded there then
luckily with Streamly it as you

762
00:43:20,232 --> 00:43:27,432
can apply CSS to your app, which is
what these stuffs that are in here

763
00:43:28,032 --> 00:43:30,822
CSS to beautify the page though.

764
00:43:31,032 --> 00:43:32,692
I'm not really good with CSS.

765
00:43:32,892 --> 00:43:37,397
I confess But I tried my best to
make sure that It's easy to read.

766
00:43:37,397 --> 00:43:40,977
The functionalities
are easy to understand.

767
00:43:41,477 --> 00:43:44,167
And moving on, let's cut the shot.

768
00:43:44,667 --> 00:43:51,607
So navigation, the navigation,
which is in here, just at the top

769
00:43:51,607 --> 00:43:54,397
of the screen, get to navigate it.

770
00:43:55,187 --> 00:43:56,497
And, yeah, that is it.

771
00:43:56,817 --> 00:43:59,627
And then main, this is
where I applied, apply CSS.

772
00:43:59,907 --> 00:44:01,107
I called the apply CSS.

773
00:44:01,607 --> 00:44:05,357
Down here and then let's
get on to the data.

774
00:44:05,387 --> 00:44:11,187
This is the part for both Sample data
that we use is on my GitHub repo as well.

775
00:44:11,207 --> 00:44:12,527
You can check it out if you want.

776
00:44:12,857 --> 00:44:16,042
It's right at The sample data path.

777
00:44:16,292 --> 00:44:17,402
So this is it.

778
00:44:17,752 --> 00:44:18,522
There's text.

779
00:44:18,802 --> 00:44:22,312
xls but I didn't add it
to the what is it called?

780
00:44:22,802 --> 00:44:24,312
The codes.

781
00:44:24,552 --> 00:44:25,842
So going back in here.

782
00:44:25,842 --> 00:44:30,302
Give me a minute.

783
00:44:30,802 --> 00:44:35,272
Navigate to page name, you can N
Navigate, which is Session State Power.

784
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:39,352
We stream that is session state, which
when you navigate it automatically

785
00:44:39,352 --> 00:44:41,472
goes down to the app, the page.

786
00:44:41,472 --> 00:44:45,822
You want all within the same page,
like you don't have to load and go onto

787
00:44:45,822 --> 00:44:50,202
another page like Abnormal Browser,
but with Session State, you get to

788
00:44:50,352 --> 00:44:53,262
go to any page within the same page.

789
00:44:53,762 --> 00:44:59,862
going down to the radio option with
streamleads is, let me show you.

790
00:45:00,472 --> 00:45:05,672
this is the radio option,
upload data or sample data.

791
00:45:06,172 --> 00:45:07,412
This is the radio option.

792
00:45:07,912 --> 00:45:11,452
And then I did a logical statement here.

793
00:45:11,532 --> 00:45:18,142
If the data is, if there is uploaded
data, then file uploaded is false.

794
00:45:18,532 --> 00:45:20,062
You pick the option is false.

795
00:45:20,352 --> 00:45:24,982
If not, then gives you the option to
upload this particular data and the type.

796
00:45:25,372 --> 00:45:26,672
So I specified the type.

797
00:45:27,002 --> 00:45:28,142
It has to be in CSV.

798
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:34,257
In JC, in Excel, both Excel,
old and new Excel, data.

799
00:45:34,377 --> 00:45:38,567
If you don't have to upload your data,
then the other option is using, use

800
00:45:38,577 --> 00:45:40,687
sample data, like I just showed you.

801
00:45:41,457 --> 00:45:46,357
And you can pick the data either
fire data Employee data and all

802
00:45:46,357 --> 00:45:50,807
that you have a really good to
understand it better So I don't waste

803
00:45:50,807 --> 00:45:52,867
so many time with employee data.

804
00:45:52,937 --> 00:45:58,347
I made sure that the date and time
The date column I turn them to I

805
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:02,277
Make sure they are in this column
so you don't get errors with it.

806
00:46:02,617 --> 00:46:06,597
And I think with upload data You
can actually automatically all date

807
00:46:06,657 --> 00:46:12,597
columns in your data automatically
using pandas dateTime function.

808
00:46:12,877 --> 00:46:17,687
I made sure compress all of them to
date and time so you don't get error.

809
00:46:17,697 --> 00:46:20,297
You can work with your
data as fast as possible.

810
00:46:20,797 --> 00:46:25,277
Then after you get the tabulation, the
data information, the data preview, the

811
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:29,987
colon row account and the descriptive
analysis, guest flow retreat.

812
00:46:30,057 --> 00:46:30,366
Eda.

813
00:46:30,367 --> 00:46:37,817
py Again now I use matplotlib
as pyplus and seaborn as sns.

814
00:46:37,817 --> 00:46:39,687
Seaborn beautifies matplotlib.

815
00:46:39,687 --> 00:46:42,887
So for say dashboard.

816
00:46:43,387 --> 00:46:45,887
okay, dashboard is connected
from visualization.

817
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:50,837
For dashboard, I use Plotly
as express and Plotly.

818
00:46:50,877 --> 00:46:54,257
grabobject as go to give
it its interactivity of.

819
00:46:54,787 --> 00:47:00,777
So at least you can check
them out at your free time.

820
00:47:01,067 --> 00:47:03,497
But I can't really go
through all the codes now.

821
00:47:03,847 --> 00:47:06,867
So going back to my demo overview.

822
00:47:07,117 --> 00:47:10,577
So basically, you see how
smooth in between sections were.

823
00:47:11,077 --> 00:47:15,347
Now the technologies I use,
obviously I use Python, which is

824
00:47:15,347 --> 00:47:19,257
the obvious one, but for the backend
development, everything I developed

825
00:47:19,307 --> 00:47:21,827
was based on, entirely on Python.

826
00:47:22,167 --> 00:47:28,027
Then Streamlit, I hosted the stuff on, I
used Streamlit, powered, Codes and then

827
00:47:28,027 --> 00:47:34,887
I will set it on the Streamlit cloud
where that's why sometimes it takes A few

828
00:47:34,887 --> 00:47:40,427
seconds to load because it's actually free
as the good thing about Streamlit is free

829
00:47:40,647 --> 00:47:45,257
You don't have to pay to actually get into
it like Instagram, for example It loads

830
00:47:45,607 --> 00:47:50,417
and oh, I forgot to show Instagram with
Instagram You can select the bins you want

831
00:47:50,437 --> 00:47:59,636
normally when I do my coding I put it at
100, 100 bins, and then this is 100 bins.

832
00:47:59,637 --> 00:48:01,457
Let's increase it to 200.

833
00:48:01,957 --> 00:48:06,187
Oh, I think there's something,
there's an issue with this.

834
00:48:06,207 --> 00:48:09,217
Let's get a good numerical data.

835
00:48:09,717 --> 00:48:13,447
And, boom, you get your,
say, added, KDE line.

836
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,757
So let's go on to 100 pins.

837
00:48:16,457 --> 00:48:18,047
Then, reduce this.

838
00:48:18,547 --> 00:48:22,067
And we see that the data
are not really together.

839
00:48:22,117 --> 00:48:27,337
So you have a lot of outliers in here
between, from 4, 000 to 10, 000, you

840
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:32,567
have a lot of outliers and then the
data was most of them are in 2000.

841
00:48:33,067 --> 00:48:37,607
For areas, for wildlife incident
number, let's start with that.

842
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:41,277
Say it's skewed to the left, even
though there are outliers, but fewer

843
00:48:41,447 --> 00:48:43,767
ones than, the area, areas burnt.

844
00:48:44,697 --> 00:48:47,247
Then you can say this is
skewed exactly to the left.

845
00:48:47,677 --> 00:48:53,097
Let's do it this way, increases the bin,
or reduces the bin as much as you can.

846
00:48:53,437 --> 00:49:00,387
that will be, that is the how it works
to Streamlit, and all my visuals, I

847
00:49:00,407 --> 00:49:06,077
use Matplotlib, I use Plotly, I use
Seaborn, and I use Plotly Express, all

848
00:49:06,117 --> 00:49:11,437
inside Plotly, as Plotly to actually
make it as interactive as possible.

849
00:49:11,777 --> 00:49:14,947
Then I deployed it on Streamlit, Cloud.

850
00:49:14,987 --> 00:49:19,437
lesson learned, the key thing that
I learned is that You can actually

851
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:22,557
build anything with programming.

852
00:49:23,057 --> 00:49:26,747
Any app that is out there has
been built by something, and

853
00:49:26,747 --> 00:49:28,467
you can actually build it again.

854
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:34,377
Though it might not be as high, as
big, or as developed, or as modern

855
00:49:34,407 --> 00:49:35,997
as the app that is being maintained.

856
00:49:35,997 --> 00:49:37,867
Because people get paid to do it.

857
00:49:38,117 --> 00:49:40,177
But you can actually build
something within your own

858
00:49:40,237 --> 00:49:41,537
confines, within your own comfort.

859
00:49:42,357 --> 00:49:43,407
And make it work.

860
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:49,247
you can get user importance of user
friendly design and interactivity.

861
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:54,677
And the I it handled though I didn't show
it, but the app, I've tested it before.

862
00:49:54,677 --> 00:49:59,477
You can handle it more larger
data sets, not just 47 columns.

863
00:49:59,477 --> 00:50:06,397
It can add up to 30 equals and about
500 rows for future enhancement.

864
00:50:06,757 --> 00:50:08,557
I'm planning on looking to add.

865
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:11,967
Machine learning for
machine learning features.

866
00:50:12,157 --> 00:50:15,787
So you can just come in, say you want
to do Random forest regression, you

867
00:50:15,787 --> 00:50:20,257
can just click on random forest just
like the bus plot and then put in

868
00:50:20,257 --> 00:50:26,547
the extreme wide train tests and then
do your regression analysis or you

869
00:50:26,547 --> 00:50:31,812
can do Sg, boost your stream, graded
boost analysis or your classification,

870
00:50:32,322 --> 00:50:35,952
random forward classification, A TC,
looking to add them in the near future.

871
00:50:36,702 --> 00:50:40,902
And then I'll increase support for
adding even data set of up to a million.

872
00:50:40,902 --> 00:50:44,352
But I think that should depend on
the cloud, on the Stream D cloud

873
00:50:44,712 --> 00:50:46,392
and how effective it's going to be.

874
00:50:46,392 --> 00:50:48,312
I think this is the end of my.

875
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:52,622
Talk, virtualization and
every other thing, my slides.

876
00:50:52,992 --> 00:50:56,722
If you have any question, you
can reach out to me via LinkedIn.

877
00:50:57,602 --> 00:50:58,332
And if you have.

878
00:50:58,832 --> 00:51:02,952
advice or suggestions for me,
you can reach out to me as well.

879
00:51:03,332 --> 00:51:08,462
On final note, I'd like to say thank
you to CORE42 for allowing me to

880
00:51:08,462 --> 00:51:13,402
display my help to people out there
and I want to say a huge thank you

881
00:51:13,402 --> 00:51:20,002
to my family and thank you all for
actually watching the video and my talk.

882
00:51:20,502 --> 00:51:21,432
See you next time.
