00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,260
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,100
I'm GaN.

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,710
I have 15 plus years of experience
in designing and implementing

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,740
scalable distributor systems
in multi-cloud architecture.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,130
Today we are diving into observating
at scale, optimizing a multi-cloud

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,365
data platforms, modern enterprises.

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:23,420
Really on resilient, observable data
platforms across multi-cloud environments.

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:29,780
I am excited to share how a AIOps and
finops are transforming operations,

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,870
boosting resilience and optimizing cost.

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,310
Let's get started.

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,695
We are in a world where 94
percentage of enterprise leverage

12
00:00:39,145 --> 00:00:41,695
cloud services and 70% in.

13
00:00:42,195 --> 00:00:43,365
Avoid vendor logging.

14
00:00:43,865 --> 00:00:50,455
But here's the catch, achieving
99.999% uptime across these

15
00:00:50,455 --> 00:00:53,365
enormous is tough, fragmented tools.

16
00:00:53,635 --> 00:00:58,195
Inconsistent metrics and
silos team create blind spots.

17
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:04,405
Today we will explore how absurdity
addresses these challenges to deliver

18
00:01:04,735 --> 00:01:06,865
reliable cost equity platforms.

19
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,030
Multicloud offers
incredible opportunities.

20
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:17,410
You can cherry pick the best features from
A-W-S-G-C-P or Azure TAP into specialized

21
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,720
capabilities and avoid vendor lockin.

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,670
But the challenges are real.

23
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:27,520
65 percentage of enterprises struggle with
the fragment of visibility, inconsistent

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,760
metrics and disparate monitoring tools.

25
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,080
This leads to reactive operations
and costly inefficiencies.

26
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,790
This narrative by
providing unified insights.

27
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,926
So what is exactly a
multicloud observative?

28
00:01:41,426 --> 00:01:46,316
It's about unified visibility
monitoring all your cloud

29
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:52,196
environments simultaneously, it
enables proactive detection, catching

30
00:01:52,256 --> 00:01:54,986
issues early for faster resolution.

31
00:01:55,436 --> 00:02:00,981
IT data correlation linking metrics,
logs, and traces across provider.

32
00:02:01,931 --> 00:02:07,601
Platforms and customer usage and
standardization and normalizing

33
00:02:07,601 --> 00:02:10,061
diverse data into consistent formats.

34
00:02:10,841 --> 00:02:14,621
This is the foundation for
the operational excellence.

35
00:02:15,131 --> 00:02:19,836
Do we have a single tool I can just
buy and then have this problem fixed?

36
00:02:20,576 --> 00:02:25,416
No isn't just a tool, it's
a critical engine value.

37
00:02:26,406 --> 00:02:29,976
It accelerates product delivery
and enhancing service reliability.

38
00:02:30,126 --> 00:02:35,376
It optimizes resource allocation and
utilization across all your platforms,

39
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:41,876
and it make it scaling efficiency and
it provides 360 degree insights from

40
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:44,066
unified metrics and logs and traces.

41
00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:49,756
At, we have seen ability empower
teams to diagnose issues quickly and

42
00:02:49,756 --> 00:02:54,916
predict failures and make a data driven
decisions that impact the bottom line.

43
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,846
Okay, so how to build a foundation.

44
00:02:58,346 --> 00:03:02,456
Step one is start by
creating an unified platform.

45
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:07,481
Just come up with an idea of the unified
platform for consistent data collection.

46
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:13,641
So you should define and document
all the cloud resources and then

47
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:18,141
deploy a centralized system to
aggregate metrics, logs, and traces.

48
00:03:19,071 --> 00:03:23,841
This strategy chooses you have
single source of truth, making it

49
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,781
easier to monitor, optimize across.

50
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:32,496
AWS, GCP and Azures or any other
cloud, A driven is a game changer.

51
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:37,746
Our platforms are to detect incident 67%
faster, reducing meantime to detection.

52
00:03:38,246 --> 00:03:42,236
Advanced MLL card point road
causes instantly, which cuts the

53
00:03:42,236 --> 00:03:44,636
resolution times by 51 percentage.

54
00:03:44,636 --> 00:03:50,066
An a anomaly detection,
proven 78 percentage of

55
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:52,046
incidents before they happen.

56
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:57,881
Through efficient scaling bottling
mechanisms, this sips teams from

57
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:04,001
firefighting to strategic optimization,
boosting reliability, and cutting costs.

58
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:05,831
Let's talk features.

59
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:10,121
Smart alerting reduces electro with
the dynamic thresholds and contact

60
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:11,981
our notifications how to do it.

61
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:17,791
For example, when you have a latency based
alert for 20%, the latency increases.

62
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:19,336
You try to generate an alert.

63
00:04:19,836 --> 00:04:24,836
So there can be a lot of false positive
cases when the system tried to scale

64
00:04:24,836 --> 00:04:29,816
during that time, the unusual load
from the customer that the regular

65
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:34,226
pattern it should be, and there
may be some underlying issues and

66
00:04:34,226 --> 00:04:38,866
some subsystems is happening or it
does automatically getting fixed.

67
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:41,896
So when you have those,
all these context added.

68
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:46,831
And you make sure the alerts only
comes when the context is very clear

69
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:51,061
that, okay, there is something going
beyond auto resolving the problem.

70
00:04:51,561 --> 00:04:57,501
So that will make the alerts
more meaningful and it'll drive

71
00:04:57,501 --> 00:04:59,331
the right actions as needed.

72
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:04,686
So that is how I think we implemented
Smart Alert and Tio to make sure the

73
00:05:04,686 --> 00:05:07,616
alert won, impact our team's efficiency.

74
00:05:08,116 --> 00:05:10,516
And the next important
thing is anomaly detection.

75
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:16,026
As the time goes by and the different type
of customer, the usage pattern comes in.

76
00:05:16,476 --> 00:05:20,556
The anomaly detection is more important
because it identifies the unusual

77
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,986
pattern and how it affects the system.

78
00:05:23,486 --> 00:05:28,136
As you have this anomaly detection happens
periodically, so you able to make sure.

79
00:05:28,636 --> 00:05:32,716
Able to handle these different type
of patterns in a more efficient way in

80
00:05:32,716 --> 00:05:36,556
a, and then I think it's also helps,
I think the cost aspect as well.

81
00:05:37,056 --> 00:05:40,646
And the third one is a predictive
analytics with all this

82
00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:43,166
unified system of data alerts.

83
00:05:43,226 --> 00:05:47,606
All these things in a single
place will help you to have a.

84
00:05:48,106 --> 00:05:53,176
An ability to forecast the
resource needs also forecast any

85
00:05:53,176 --> 00:05:54,646
potential failure that can happen.

86
00:05:55,096 --> 00:05:56,746
How to do it again in radio.

87
00:05:56,746 --> 00:06:01,476
So when we monitor and aggregate the data
for every five minutes and you generate

88
00:06:01,476 --> 00:06:03,486
alerts based on all these context.

89
00:06:04,206 --> 00:06:07,866
And when you have this data for
a period of time, now you can

90
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:09,906
provide that to a predictive model.

91
00:06:10,386 --> 00:06:13,986
Now it can predict the next five
minutes based on a historical trend.

92
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:21,201
So this way you able to really understand
your various usage patterns and based

93
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:26,321
on that, how the system behaves, what
it should be done next, or what will

94
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:32,416
happen next so that you've able to scale
the resources or you generated alert.

95
00:06:33,371 --> 00:06:37,451
So that people understand there can
be a potential problem it can create

96
00:06:37,961 --> 00:06:39,881
when you cannot automatically fix it.

97
00:06:40,381 --> 00:06:43,561
So that's what I think the Predict
Analytics will really help you to

98
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:45,751
find out these type of scenarios.

99
00:06:46,321 --> 00:06:50,251
And finally, it'll become
your correlation engine.

100
00:06:50,491 --> 00:06:51,631
You should make sure.

101
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:56,491
In your unified system, you are
able to understand all the different

102
00:06:56,491 --> 00:07:01,191
signals coming across the, in the
case of multi-tenant, the tenant level

103
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:05,631
signals, the platform level signals,
and each and every subsystem level

104
00:07:05,631 --> 00:07:10,161
signals the cloud level signals and
also the, and you go next, I think

105
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:11,601
you add the cost level signals.

106
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:16,511
Everything together is a one
engine, so you troubleshoot.

107
00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:20,401
Efficiently optimize the
subsystems, which are have a huge

108
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:22,741
impact on the final outcomes.

109
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:27,431
One of the biggest wins because
with the AOPs, our teams able to

110
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:30,791
manage 3.4 times more infrastructure
without additional staff.

111
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:34,591
Automation handles the routine
tasks and freeing engineers to

112
00:07:34,591 --> 00:07:36,721
focus on the next innovation.

113
00:07:37,171 --> 00:07:41,611
It'll provide a compounding
results even when you are a small,

114
00:07:41,701 --> 00:07:44,311
medium or log large organization.

115
00:07:44,761 --> 00:07:47,401
The already enables efficient
operations at scale.

116
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:52,366
Now let's integrate finops
Observability of AOPs.

117
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:59,381
And finops gives you a comprehensive
cost visibility in real time, alongside

118
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:01,841
the reason why it had really happened.

119
00:08:02,531 --> 00:08:05,771
It enables data-driven
forecasting for better budgeting.

120
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:10,661
You are now able to correlate the
cost with a real usage and what

121
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:12,461
type of usage drives the cost.

122
00:08:12,986 --> 00:08:19,346
So now we have a very unique
formula to create a budget on the

123
00:08:19,346 --> 00:08:21,716
usage trend and the cost trend.

124
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:25,896
And based on type of usage you expect
from a various customers you are

125
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:28,556
expecting to get the optimization through.

126
00:08:28,586 --> 00:08:33,116
Intelligent rightsizing saves
significant costs and precise cost

127
00:08:33,116 --> 00:08:35,306
allocation to business accountability.

128
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,716
To focus and to get the maximum value.

129
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:44,016
So that's why that having a clear,
unified observability system

130
00:08:44,016 --> 00:08:50,256
incorporating all these data points
into one, it drives multiple benefits,

131
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:53,286
including aspect and budgeting aspect.

132
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:55,206
The result speaks for themself.

133
00:08:55,836 --> 00:09:00,636
We able to achieve 28 to 37% reduction
in cloud expenditure through strategic

134
00:09:00,636 --> 00:09:02,946
resource placement and right sizing.

135
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:06,491
Automated reduction
eliminates ideal resources.

136
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:10,341
Boosting computing efficiency by 61%.

137
00:09:11,121 --> 00:09:19,431
Underutilized instance drops by 43
plus precise cost attribution and to

138
00:09:19,431 --> 00:09:24,021
person more accurate budget forecasting
airlines spending with business code.

139
00:09:24,951 --> 00:09:28,011
Also, these efforts translate
to digital business impact.

140
00:09:28,011 --> 00:09:31,371
We act a time to market by
three times through operational

141
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:34,071
efficiency, the service reliability.

142
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:40,616
41% and enhancing availability and
which have a impact on the customer

143
00:09:40,616 --> 00:09:46,436
certifications and be able to free up
more resources to do the innovative

144
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:48,776
things using a and other things.

145
00:09:49,106 --> 00:09:52,011
So that's really had a great impact.

146
00:09:52,611 --> 00:09:57,741
We understand what is AIOps finops, how to
put everything together in observability

147
00:09:57,741 --> 00:10:01,581
for the multicloud architecture and
how much benefit you can get out.

148
00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:02,431
Let's.

149
00:10:02,931 --> 00:10:04,011
How to make this work.

150
00:10:04,511 --> 00:10:07,931
The step one is think
observative first architecture.

151
00:10:08,831 --> 00:10:10,481
Designing any system.

152
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:16,681
You should first think how many data
points I'm going to get it, and is it

153
00:10:16,681 --> 00:10:24,241
aligned to my standards and how this
will visualized into am I unified system?

154
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:29,431
So how this will tie to the cost,
how this impacts the customer.

155
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:31,191
Usage and behaviors.

156
00:10:31,691 --> 00:10:34,321
So the step one is clear strategy.

157
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:37,201
So you define your goals of observability.

158
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:42,621
On top of it, the KPIs for all US
systems, implement a comprehensive

159
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:44,541
instrumentation for telemetric collection.

160
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:50,411
On top of this, you should have a strategy
to apply a and ML for, and automations.

161
00:10:51,311 --> 00:10:52,631
It cannot be done everything.

162
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:57,571
Intelligent systems to automatically
extract insights and automate

163
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:00,721
your alerts and other activities.

164
00:11:01,221 --> 00:11:09,981
Next one is add this with the finops, the
cost data that will make you justify which

165
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:12,201
type of optimization drive how much cost.

166
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:16,121
Also, it'll understand how user behavior.

167
00:11:16,621 --> 00:11:20,071
I think drives the cost
based on different usage.

168
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:25,351
This framework s the observative
from the start and creating a

169
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,391
sustainable and efficient platforms.

170
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:32,731
So now let's see, few best
practices, which are highly

171
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:35,701
important, which you cannot skip.

172
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:37,496
I think when you start on this journey.

173
00:11:37,996 --> 00:11:42,886
The first one is you should have a
centralized collection of these data

174
00:11:43,186 --> 00:11:48,886
so that you'll able to understand
your systems and customers and

175
00:11:48,886 --> 00:11:53,286
cost in a single source of truth
and implement a standardized

176
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:56,076
tagging across all these clouds.

177
00:11:56,576 --> 00:11:57,686
The tags shouldn't

178
00:11:58,186 --> 00:11:58,406
ta.

179
00:11:58,906 --> 00:12:03,196
And more important thing is not number
of tags, but the what type of value you

180
00:12:03,196 --> 00:12:08,536
added and how you manage those values
where everybody else able to understand

181
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:15,496
the different type of applications, A, the
purpose all these systems are working on.

182
00:12:16,426 --> 00:12:22,201
Next, you should adopt as a code to deploy
monitoring alongside infrastructure.

183
00:12:22,531 --> 00:12:23,901
IT independent.

184
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:28,811
You should make sure that when the
system designed and when we implement

185
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:34,631
the code and then when we deploy systems,
the ity should be part of those code.

186
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:41,291
And you should create a framework
from the time the design starts at

187
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:46,021
the till, the time it gets deployed
and align the business how value.

188
00:12:46,521 --> 00:12:50,331
How each and every work
drives how much value.

189
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:54,861
In a more concrete terms, in a financial
terms, you are able to prove it.

190
00:12:55,521 --> 00:13:00,381
So these practices will make
the ab observ scalable and very

191
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:01,911
impactful in the organization.

192
00:13:02,411 --> 00:13:03,371
Are you ready to start?

193
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:08,021
So I can just give you a
high level action plan.

194
00:13:08,381 --> 00:13:09,731
How you can approach this.

195
00:13:10,231 --> 00:13:12,961
Of course every system has
some level of observability.

196
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:16,671
So first thing is you should
understand the current state.

197
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:21,071
Most of our systems are already built
and you are trying to add some things

198
00:13:21,071 --> 00:13:26,741
over the step one, make sure you are not
thinking the ideal state immediately.

199
00:13:27,281 --> 00:13:28,961
Just assess the current state.

200
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:33,221
Understand how much maturity
this absurdity has, and

201
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:35,561
find out the critical gaps.

202
00:13:36,061 --> 00:13:41,311
And then document all the CA type of
tools and systems I think currently

203
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:45,511
being used and what type of expected
baseline performance we need.

204
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:50,601
And then you find the opportunity
for the enhancement once we identify

205
00:13:50,601 --> 00:13:54,501
all the current state and expected
requirements and to achieve.

206
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,736
Now think of target architecture.

207
00:13:57,566 --> 00:14:00,236
So each and every application
system is different.

208
00:14:00,236 --> 00:14:05,126
So I'm not going to give anything
as a blueprint to implement it.

209
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:10,026
But the thinking should be based on
the different type of cloud services

210
00:14:10,026 --> 00:14:13,206
and applications you deploy and
the different workloads you run.

211
00:14:13,656 --> 00:14:17,856
You should have a target architecture
defined properly, and then

212
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,106
you select the suitable tools.

213
00:14:20,136 --> 00:14:23,226
So the architecture should be
how the data you collected.

214
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:29,031
And what aggregation or alerting interval
should be sufficient for your business.

215
00:14:29,811 --> 00:14:33,321
For example, we have five minutes
aggregation of these outlets, and

216
00:14:33,351 --> 00:14:37,371
of course we will have real time
platform failure and all those

217
00:14:37,371 --> 00:14:40,551
outlets, but on top of it, the
more important is understanding the

218
00:14:40,551 --> 00:14:42,441
multi-cloud, multi-tenant architecture.

219
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:45,111
We should able to aggregate
every five minutes to understand

220
00:14:45,111 --> 00:14:46,671
how the systems are working.

221
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:52,721
So all the health check alerts can happen
in a more milliseconds and seconds type

222
00:14:52,721 --> 00:14:58,721
of it, but this performance and all these
alerts can have at the final interval.

223
00:14:58,961 --> 00:15:03,221
So you can define your goal and
target architecture based on that.

224
00:15:04,211 --> 00:15:07,211
And then you create a comprehensive
instrumentation of these

225
00:15:07,321 --> 00:15:08,971
metrics coming into your system.

226
00:15:09,481 --> 00:15:12,501
Set the proper governance and
compliance standard, don't

227
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:13,701
implement in a different way.

228
00:15:14,201 --> 00:15:17,086
Next, focus on high impact workload First.

229
00:15:17,586 --> 00:15:24,486
Because as we do this, as a fundamental
change to the platform, you should not

230
00:15:24,516 --> 00:15:27,156
try to solve all the problem at once.

231
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:31,356
Take the highest impact, one,
implement this and show the value

232
00:15:31,356 --> 00:15:35,046
how much money you're able to
save, how efficient the scaling is.

233
00:15:35,526 --> 00:15:40,536
That will make I think success for
the next level of, and that will.

234
00:15:41,036 --> 00:15:43,556
Larger context in the long term basis.

235
00:15:43,706 --> 00:15:48,416
So take the high impact upload first,
implement it efficiently on that one,

236
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:54,386
and show the business value out of it so
that irate over it for other services.

237
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:59,516
That's how it should be approached
whenever you go for this thing.

238
00:16:00,016 --> 00:16:01,486
Yeah, we have come to the end of it.

239
00:16:01,486 --> 00:16:05,596
In closing, I wanna say Observ
at scale is about transforming

240
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:10,666
multi-cloud operations from reactive
to proactive, from costly to efficient.

241
00:16:11,296 --> 00:16:16,846
By leveraging AIOps finops, you can
build resilient, cost-effective data

242
00:16:16,846 --> 00:16:19,066
platforms that drive business success.

243
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:23,706
So when you focus on the don't.

244
00:16:24,206 --> 00:16:28,796
As one cost and customer usage,
all these things shouldn't

245
00:16:28,826 --> 00:16:30,116
consider as a separate one.

246
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:37,796
So we should integrate the AOPs and finops
as observability platform and we should

247
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:40,826
be able to drive an outcome based on that.

248
00:16:41,456 --> 00:16:46,496
With the cost and finops data, the a
operational things of platforms will

249
00:16:46,496 --> 00:16:51,296
get benefited, but the platform data,
the cost, and then forecasting will.

250
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:56,546
So we should think in a way that,
how it can provide maximum business

251
00:16:56,546 --> 00:16:59,186
value, not like a siloed operations.

252
00:16:59,906 --> 00:17:00,956
Thank you for your time.

253
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,836
I'm looking forward to hear how
you were able to take this journey

254
00:17:03,896 --> 00:17:06,836
and move forward and share your
experience with everybody else.

255
00:17:07,256 --> 00:17:07,586
Thank you.
