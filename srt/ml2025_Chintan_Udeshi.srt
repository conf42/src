00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,070
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,960
My name is Tta Eshi and I'm a lead
product manager or a principal

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,120
product manager at Palo Alto Networks.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,130
I have over 12 years of experience
working in the tech industry, and

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,760
for the last seven and a half years
I have worked as a product manager

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,830
mainly in the cybersecurity space.

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,849
My area of expertise include AI security,
container security, and runtime security

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,890
to protect organizations applications
running on public cloud and private cloud.

9
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:38,849
Today I'm here to talk about how to
implement AI security so that enterprise

10
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,160
can innovate and introduce AI applications
in their environment confidently.

11
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,260
So let's get started with,
let's start with AI adoption.

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,089
As many of you might already
know, AI is consistently gaining

13
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:55,950
traction in the industry today.

14
00:00:56,519 --> 00:01:02,730
According to the recent PWC report,
over around 86% of the executives

15
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,160
are expecting that AI will become
the mainstream technology in 2025.

16
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,670
Out of these 86% of the companies.

17
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:18,030
60% of the organizations are planning
to integrate AI technology into mission

18
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:24,175
critical infrastructure, and this was
what makes AI security really important.

19
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:31,525
Because with introduction of AI security
into the mission critical infrastructure,

20
00:01:32,335 --> 00:01:38,485
the exposure or the risk related to
AI security increases exponentially.

21
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:45,040
L. Before we talk about the security
aspect, let's talk about why AI is

22
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,290
gaining so much of traction in the
industry in the last couple of years.

23
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,980
The first main reason is
enhance decision making.

24
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,470
AI can analyze large sets of
data, identify the pattern and

25
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,370
insight that might be difficult
for the human being to identify.

26
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:03,790
Okay.

27
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,720
Based on that data, it can
come up with a recommendation.

28
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,250
It can provide the forecast,
allowing organizations to make

29
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:14,110
business critical decisions.

30
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:21,310
Secondly, it can automate the
repetitive task and it allows employees

31
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,820
to focus on more innovative work.

32
00:02:26,154 --> 00:02:29,545
On top of that, AI can
optimize the workflows.

33
00:02:29,605 --> 00:02:35,154
It can reduce the human error, and
overall it improves the efficiency,

34
00:02:35,605 --> 00:02:41,545
thus allowing organization to reduce
the cost and roll out the application

35
00:02:41,545 --> 00:02:44,005
into their environment very quickly.

36
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:50,964
The third reason for AI adoption growth
is it opens up new business opportunities.

37
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:56,860
AI can help companies develop new
products and offers to their customers.

38
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:04,300
AI can analyze the market trends and allow
organizations to reach to new markets

39
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,370
or new geographical regions as well.

40
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,640
Lastly, improved customer experience.

41
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:16,660
So recently I attended the cybersecurity
conference called RSA in San Francisco.

42
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,740
And I, as I was talking to a lot of
customers and trying to understand

43
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,460
what different players in the
industry are doing, I saw that lot

44
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:29,920
of customers or lot of organizations
have already started to roll out AI

45
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,589
chat bots and virtual assistance for
their customers because this allows

46
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:43,510
organizations to provide 24 7 customer
support on top of that organizations.

47
00:03:44,164 --> 00:03:50,044
Use AI to personalize the marketing
campaigns offer recommendation based

48
00:03:50,044 --> 00:03:51,904
on the customer preferences and data.

49
00:03:52,624 --> 00:03:57,874
On top of that, AI can potentially
identify the problems early on before

50
00:03:57,874 --> 00:04:01,834
it impacts the customer, thus improving
the customer experience overall.

51
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:07,384
And these are the reasons why AI adoption
is improving significantly in the

52
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:09,094
industry in the last couple of years.

53
00:04:09,664 --> 00:04:14,764
Now that we know why AI adoption is
growing in the market, let's talk

54
00:04:14,764 --> 00:04:19,054
about some of the security threads
that are introduced because of ai.

55
00:04:19,595 --> 00:04:21,845
First of all is the data vulnerability.

56
00:04:23,794 --> 00:04:29,135
All the organizations use training
data to train their AI models.

57
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:33,485
Bad actors can take advantage
of this, and they can poison the

58
00:04:33,485 --> 00:04:38,284
training data, which will impact
the integrity of the AI system.

59
00:04:38,885 --> 00:04:41,135
Second reason is the privacy concern.

60
00:04:41,554 --> 00:04:47,104
Imagine the situation where AI chatbots
is exposing the SSN number of the

61
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:52,865
customers, or it is providing critical
health information, the people who don't

62
00:04:52,865 --> 00:04:54,995
have the right access or privileges.

63
00:04:55,414 --> 00:04:59,734
So privacy concerns are going
to increase with adoption of ai.

64
00:05:01,115 --> 00:05:03,814
Third reason is the AI generated threats.

65
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:08,525
Bad actor can take advantage
of sophisticated defects.

66
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:12,395
They can create the misinformation
campaign and they can create the

67
00:05:13,054 --> 00:05:18,184
sophisticated cyber attacks at scale,
which might be difficult to detect.

68
00:05:18,844 --> 00:05:24,485
The other aspect that companies need to
consider is the reg regulatory compliance.

69
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:30,380
Because compliance needs are different
for different geographical regions

70
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,240
as well as different industry.

71
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:35,569
For example, finance industry
cares about FIPs compliance.

72
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,049
Healthcare industry cares
about HIPAA compliance.

73
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:44,600
So organizations that are rolling out AI
application needs to be aware of potential

74
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:49,640
penalties that might impact them if they
are not following the right guidelines.

75
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,960
Let's talk about even more
advanced security threats that

76
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,700
are introduced because of ai.

77
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,150
AI has started to create the
realistic impersonations that will

78
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,560
bypass the traditional security,
and they are specifically targeting

79
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,960
executives with this impersonation.

80
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:16,850
On top of that, they are creating deeply
personalized attacks at scale that they

81
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,130
couldn't do it without the AI technology.

82
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,205
They are personalizing
the email campaigns.

83
00:06:22,265 --> 00:06:27,095
Those to gain the entry into the
organization, and once they are inside the

84
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:33,065
organization, they try to move this attack
laterally to the rest of the organization.

85
00:06:33,245 --> 00:06:34,895
Next is model poisoning.

86
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:40,985
Just like they can poison the
data, the bad actors might try to

87
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:44,195
poison the model as well, that way.

88
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,310
The integrity of the model might
be impacted, and it might start

89
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,420
giving the outputs, which are
not the right or not recommended

90
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,980
for the customers or end users.

91
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:03,930
Three versus real attacks because bad
actors can provide different inputs to the

92
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:10,980
AI models to see what kind of information
that AI model is revealing now.

93
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:18,090
Basically a, based on this, bad
actors can reverse engineer on what

94
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,720
are some of the vulnerabilities of
the models, and then they can use

95
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,220
that against the organization to gain
access to the sensitive information,

96
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,480
which otherwise they won't have access
to because of all these reasons.

97
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,354
Security of AI application is
becoming really critical because

98
00:07:36,354 --> 00:07:42,294
that is the only way that will allow
organizations to roll out AI applications

99
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:47,974
confidently, either to their internal
customers or to the end customers.

100
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:53,645
Let's talk about what would be the
implications if AI applications

101
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:55,085
are not secured properly.

102
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,700
First of all, there will
be a huge financial impact.

103
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:04,250
If there is a data breach, then there
will be a huge financial loss for the

104
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:09,380
organization, and the recovery cost
would be significantly higher than

105
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:14,180
the investment that they can make
in protecting the AI applications.

106
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,410
Secondly, there might be a huge
impact on the reputation if customer

107
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:24,120
sensitive data leaves the organization
and comes in the hands of bad actors.

108
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:29,700
Or there might be a ransomware
attack, then there's a impact on the

109
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,309
re reputation of the organization.

110
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:37,845
This impacts customer retention
and hence the revenue of the

111
00:08:37,845 --> 00:08:39,539
organization in the long run.

112
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:45,610
Lastly, there are legal consequences
if regulations are not followed

113
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,160
properly because of all these reasons.

114
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,660
Organizations need to invest in AI
security now so that they can confidently

115
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:01,540
roll out AI applications to their end
customers and internal users confidently.

116
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:03,640
Stop.

117
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:12,640
Now that we know AI security is really
important to ensure AI adoption across

118
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,230
the industries, let's understand
the key aspects of AI security.

119
00:09:17,245 --> 00:09:20,365
We will start with
secure model deployment.

120
00:09:20,755 --> 00:09:24,865
First of all, the model should
be protected all the time.

121
00:09:25,285 --> 00:09:27,895
It should be protected
against E DDoS attack.

122
00:09:28,255 --> 00:09:33,205
On top of that, the data transfer that
is happening between application and the

123
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,995
model should be secured all the time.

124
00:09:36,745 --> 00:09:41,005
On top of that model should be
protected against prompt injection

125
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:44,665
attack as well as we need to, or the
organization need to ensure that.

126
00:09:45,475 --> 00:09:50,545
There is no data leakage to ensure
organization's sensitive data

127
00:09:50,845 --> 00:09:52,765
is not leaving the organization.

128
00:09:53,275 --> 00:09:57,536
The next important aspect of
the AI security is the data

129
00:09:57,565 --> 00:09:59,275
security and privacy control.

130
00:09:59,935 --> 00:10:03,745
The data which is resting in
the database or in the files

131
00:10:04,285 --> 00:10:06,295
should be encrypted all the time.

132
00:10:06,775 --> 00:10:11,395
So that even if the bad actors are able
to somehow get access to the database or

133
00:10:11,395 --> 00:10:18,205
the fire system, they still won't be able
to use that data for the bad purposes.

134
00:10:18,655 --> 00:10:22,675
On top of that, there should be a
rule-based access scroll in place

135
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:31,495
that will ensure that users who have
the right privileges, they are the

136
00:10:31,495 --> 00:10:36,325
only ones who are able to access the
application or a access the database.

137
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:45,340
That way, the attack surface is minimized
significantly and the chances of data

138
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,440
breach reduces significantly as well.

139
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,990
On top of that, one of the commonly
used architecture in the industry

140
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,550
is zero trust architecture,
which essentially means trust.

141
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:04,450
No one authenticate everyone back
in, back around 15 to 20 years back.

142
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:12,640
When cloud was not a big factor, the
architectures or the systems were

143
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,395
designed in such a way that all the
connections or all the requests that were

144
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,750
coming from within the organization's
infrastructure were considered valid.

145
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,790
But any connection or any requests that
are coming from outside the organization,

146
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,860
infrastructure were considered invalid.

147
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:35,755
Now that AI adoption on the cloud
adoption has grown significantly

148
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:40,825
and data resides in the data center,
but in the public cloud as well.

149
00:11:41,275 --> 00:11:46,075
This architecture that was used 15 to 20
years ago, that is no longer applicable.

150
00:11:46,555 --> 00:11:51,115
So with zero trust architecture, any
connection request is authenticated

151
00:11:51,925 --> 00:11:56,335
to make sure it is coming from the
valid user or valid application.

152
00:11:56,905 --> 00:12:02,995
And many times users, it is recommended
that multi-factor authentication is place

153
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:09,185
is in place so that even if bad actors
get access to let's say email or the

154
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:16,270
text messages of the user, there are with
multi-factor authentication, the chances

155
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,275
of the breach reduced significantly.

156
00:12:18,635 --> 00:12:23,225
On top of that, any system or
any user who needs to access

157
00:12:23,225 --> 00:12:25,505
any database or any system.

158
00:12:25,985 --> 00:12:30,885
They should be given the least
privileges that they will need to

159
00:12:30,945 --> 00:12:36,195
in order to do their job, in order
to ensure that even if a part of the

160
00:12:36,195 --> 00:12:41,485
infrastructure is in, in infected,
because of the malware, micro segmentation

161
00:12:41,545 --> 00:12:43,315
policies are really important.

162
00:12:43,675 --> 00:12:47,185
These policies ensure that
threats are not moving laterally

163
00:12:47,905 --> 00:12:48,475
to the rest of the organization.

164
00:12:49,255 --> 00:12:52,945
So that even if part of the infrastructure
or some of the applications are

165
00:12:52,945 --> 00:13:00,435
inspect infected by malware or
CVE, the same malware won't infect

166
00:13:00,435 --> 00:13:02,265
rest of the infrastructure as well.

167
00:13:02,835 --> 00:13:06,285
The other thing on top of
micro segmentation, which is

168
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,405
important to consider, is the
runtime security protection.

169
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:14,595
So many of you might have heard about log
four J vulnerability that was detected

170
00:13:14,595 --> 00:13:16,681
in a software back in December, 2021.

171
00:13:17,385 --> 00:13:24,765
Even though it existed in the software
for seven plus years, so the organizations

172
00:13:24,765 --> 00:13:31,425
that are deploying all the right
security policies, they and they are

173
00:13:31,425 --> 00:13:35,055
patching their applications from time
to time against the vulnerabilities.

174
00:13:35,445 --> 00:13:39,680
They are still vulnerable to
unpacked and unknown vulnerabilities.

175
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:43,905
And that is why runtime security
protection where we are continuously

176
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:47,865
mon monitoring the traffic and
detecting any anomalies or threats.

177
00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:50,475
It is important to have that all the time.

178
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:55,725
On top of that, it is good to have the
monitoring tool so that in it can inspect

179
00:13:55,725 --> 00:13:57,445
any anomaly that might be vulnerable.

180
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:04,000
To ensure your or organization's sensitive
data stays within the organization.

181
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,140
Next, let's talk about
building the AI system.

182
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:13,060
So many times in the organization what
happens is while they are designing the

183
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:19,750
architecture or the system architecture,
security is not considered upfront.

184
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,950
It is an afterthought many times,
but that shouldn't be the case while

185
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,510
designing the architecture itself.

186
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:31,900
Software engineers and security architects
need to make sure the system and the

187
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,660
architecture is secure by default.

188
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,190
On top of that, once the architecture
is in place and development is in

189
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:44,650
progress, it is still important to
do continuous assessment to ensure

190
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,630
the system is secure all the time.

191
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,490
Monitoring tools will help
the organization to check any

192
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,770
anomalies or unauthorized access.

193
00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:01,870
So the system is secure by the, on top of
that, it is important to have the recovery

194
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:06,610
planning and the backup available for
your system and important information

195
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,710
so that even if you are attacked, once
you recover from the attack, you can

196
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,200
quickly recover from your backup data.

197
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:18,940
You can restore your website and the
database and the system so that the

198
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,540
disruption to the end users is minimal.

199
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:28,135
Next, let's talk about
securing AI lifecycle.

200
00:15:28,675 --> 00:15:34,765
As I mentioned in the previous slide,
security starts from day one when

201
00:15:34,765 --> 00:15:40,165
you, when the organizations are
starting to build the architecture

202
00:15:40,225 --> 00:15:42,055
or infrastructure for the product.

203
00:15:42,595 --> 00:15:47,275
So it is important to have
comprehensive security requirements

204
00:15:47,275 --> 00:15:48,660
while building the new system.

205
00:15:49,555 --> 00:15:54,565
On top of that, it is important to
decide how the data that is saved

206
00:15:54,865 --> 00:16:00,385
will be openly while developing the
models or developing any applications.

207
00:16:00,715 --> 00:16:06,055
It is important to have the secure coding
standards so that as in when the system

208
00:16:06,055 --> 00:16:13,015
is getting built, it is secure by design,
rigorous access control on who can access

209
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:15,655
what should be implemented from day one.

210
00:16:16,645 --> 00:16:20,905
As in when the system is getting built,
it is important to do thorough pen

211
00:16:20,905 --> 00:16:27,595
testing and the stress testing to ensure
your system doesn't break when attackers

212
00:16:27,775 --> 00:16:29,875
are attacking from all the directions.

213
00:16:30,925 --> 00:16:36,205
Additionally, regular vulnerability
assessments and attack simulations,

214
00:16:36,235 --> 00:16:41,000
how to take place on the
system to identify any cvs and.

215
00:16:42,205 --> 00:16:46,915
Fix them as soon as they are detected
so that the bad actors cannot take

216
00:16:46,915 --> 00:16:52,915
advantage of that vulnerability to
steal organization's sensitive data.

217
00:16:53,335 --> 00:16:56,605
Finally, as I mentioned in
the previous slide as well,

218
00:16:56,965 --> 00:17:01,945
continuously monitoring your system
for anomaly is really important.

219
00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:06,204
For example, let's say if you,
if the organization has all

220
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:08,215
their offices in United States.

221
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:13,810
All of a sudden, let's say an application
or a user who might be sitting in Asia or

222
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:19,910
Africa tries to access the applications
or data, which is located in United

223
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:25,730
States, they shouldn't be able to detect
those as in when such vulnerabilities

224
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:34,250
or such anomalies are detected on time,
that is when security can improve.

225
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:40,850
Continuously and ensure that your
AI applications or any applications

226
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:46,280
for that master are completely
secure and organization data is

227
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,570
safe, and then it is not going
into the hands of the bad actors.

228
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,950
Next, let's talk about the regulatory
landscape over the years, different

229
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:02,720
industry located either in United
States or outside United States.

230
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,950
They have come up with their
own compliance requirements.

231
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,800
For example, HIPAA is a very
commonly used compliance framework

232
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,720
for medical professionals.

233
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:19,790
FIPs is very commonly used by the finance
industry, and then there are other

234
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,580
regulatory standards like Fedra as well.

235
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,860
On top of that, GDPR is very
commonly used in the EU region.

236
00:18:28,535 --> 00:18:32,795
GDPR enforces comprehensive
data protection requirements

237
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:34,235
for all their systems.

238
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:41,135
It requires explicit consent, it requires
data minimalization, and on top of that,

239
00:18:42,065 --> 00:18:47,045
organizations have to provide the right
explanation for the automated decisions.

240
00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:49,200
Now with the,

241
00:18:51,245 --> 00:18:53,855
with AI adoption increasing day by day.

242
00:18:54,785 --> 00:19:02,045
EU is proposing a new AI act which will
provide all the regulations on how to use

243
00:19:02,045 --> 00:19:07,415
the AI applications, categorize the AI
application by the risk level, top the

244
00:19:07,415 --> 00:19:14,315
prohibited practices, and then provide
the transparency obligation so that the

245
00:19:14,315 --> 00:19:21,005
data that is used to train the AI models
or the data that is used to make systems

246
00:19:21,005 --> 00:19:23,495
better, they are used in the right way.

247
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:29,060
Similarly, all the other compliance that
I mentioned, hipaa, fs, FedRAMP, they are

248
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:34,250
taking into consideration the fact that
AI adoption is increasing, so they are

249
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:39,290
changing the regulation so that it works
well with the AI applications that will be

250
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,470
rolled out in now or in the near future.

251
00:19:42,475 --> 00:19:42,515
Uchen.

252
00:19:44,135 --> 00:19:48,140
Before I end this presentation,
I also want to take in into the

253
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,070
consideration the ethical consideration,
first of all, is the fairness.

254
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:58,400
When we are training the AI model, we
need to implement the rigorous security

255
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,210
measures to prevent the bias against any
specific any specific diverse population.

256
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:10,250
It has to ensure demographically
balanced traffic dataset.

257
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,910
Second important thing to
consider is the transparency.

258
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,420
The AI has to balance the rubbish
security with maintaining the system.

259
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:24,784
On top of that, there should be
detailed documentation on all the

260
00:20:24,784 --> 00:20:29,699
security controls, and they should be
updated from the, from time to ensure

261
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:35,819
the architecture and the system is
secure against new vulnerabilities.

262
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:40,979
On top of that, it is important to
establish the explicit data usage

263
00:20:40,979 --> 00:20:45,459
policies, and it should be ac accessible
by all the important stakeholders.

264
00:20:46,554 --> 00:20:50,185
Third important aspect to
consider is the privacy respect.

265
00:20:50,485 --> 00:20:54,804
So individual rights and autonomy
should always be considered

266
00:20:54,804 --> 00:20:57,205
while training the AI models.

267
00:20:57,745 --> 00:21:03,215
Then on top of that, AI models need
to apply data minimization principle

268
00:21:03,215 --> 00:21:07,750
to reduce the vulnerability surfaces,
and all the systems should be

269
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,990
patched for cvs from time to time.

270
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:14,435
Finally, no system is perfect.

271
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:19,219
So in order to ensure AI is
doing the right thing, human

272
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:21,889
oversight is absolutely important.

273
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:27,049
So just in case if AI is doing
something wrong, human should be

274
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:32,959
able to override that mechanism
that, or steps that AI is performing.

275
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,459
On top of that, there should be a
structured human process review.

276
00:21:37,774 --> 00:21:41,044
So that all the critical
decisions are reviewed to make

277
00:21:41,044 --> 00:21:43,205
sure AI is behaving correctly.

278
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:47,074
And if AI is not performing up to
the mark, humans should be able

279
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:48,814
to override them all the time.

280
00:21:49,084 --> 00:21:53,615
So finally, let's talk about the
key takeaways of this presentation.

281
00:21:53,915 --> 00:21:59,399
As I mentioned before AI adoption
is increasing rapidly in order to

282
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:02,639
ensure organizations are able to.

283
00:22:03,584 --> 00:22:07,694
Successfully deploy AI
applications in their environment.

284
00:22:07,874 --> 00:22:13,215
Security is very critical, so
security should be taken into the

285
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:17,894
consideration from day one, so
it should be security by design.

286
00:22:18,344 --> 00:22:23,205
On top of that, customers or organization
should develop microsegmentation

287
00:22:23,205 --> 00:22:25,695
policies, r back policies.

288
00:22:25,725 --> 00:22:29,534
They should protect their AI
applications, models, data.

289
00:22:29,864 --> 00:22:35,475
And they should continuously evolve
their security practices to ensure AI

290
00:22:35,475 --> 00:22:41,144
applications are secure and none of their
sensitive data leaves the organization.

291
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:46,814
Like on top of that, they also need
to comply with the regular compliance

292
00:22:46,814 --> 00:22:52,094
frameworks such as hipaa, GDPR, FIPs, and
any other frameworks that are applicable

293
00:22:52,665 --> 00:22:54,495
for that particular organization.

294
00:22:54,764 --> 00:22:57,675
And ethical considerations
are really important.

295
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:01,799
While training the models and
human oversight should be taken

296
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:06,360
into the consideration and should
be treated as a top priority to

297
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,159
ensure AI is not doing something
that it is not supposed to do hope.

298
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:15,989
This presentation provided you
all the insights that you needed

299
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:21,854
to ensure how organizations can
secure their AI applications.

300
00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:27,180
So that they can confidently roll
out AI applications either for their

301
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:32,730
employees and for the end customers
in order to improve their operational

302
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:38,940
efficiency, reduce the cost, increase
the customer satisfaction, and

303
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:43,080
increase their revenue and position
in the market in the long run.

304
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,020
Thank you so much for your time.

305
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:49,260
I really appreciate it, and
if you have any questions,

306
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,550
feel free to reach out to me.

307
00:23:50,834 --> 00:23:52,274
Thanks a lot and have a nice day.
