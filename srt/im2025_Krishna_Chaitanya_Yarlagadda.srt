1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,539
Good morning and good afternoon everybody.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,160
My name is Ana Yata, and today
I'll be walking you through how AI

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,050
transformed the incident management.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,140
In supply chain operations.

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:16,450
So from whole reactive process to
a proactive process via automated

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:21,460
prevention system, a lot of this thinking
builds on both academic work and my

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:26,749
professional experience including my time
at Amazon where we dealt largely with

8
00:00:26,749 --> 00:00:30,800
a complexity of large scale operations
and the importance of minimizing the

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,230
disruptions, especially the supply chains.

10
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,750
The critical challenge is basically
like cast cutting a supply chain

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:42,910
disruptions, supply chains are
usually a fragile ecosystems, a

12
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,690
single failure delayed shipment.

13
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,110
Or a warehouse breakdown can create a
ripple effects across the whole network.

14
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,540
At Amazon, I saw this firsthand.

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,070
One node in the system such as a
regional fulfillment center could trigger

16
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,650
stockouts and missed delivery promises.

17
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,240
The downstream traditional approaches
usually tend to focus on fixing

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,530
the problems after they occur, but
by that point, the customer trust

19
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,600
and revenue are already at risk.

20
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,910
This is a challenge we
are trying to solve.

21
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:16,459
Next is AI revolution from reactive
approach to a proactive approach.

22
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:20,869
As I said earlier, here is a fundamental
shift instead of waiting for a

23
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:26,059
breakdown and then scrambling in the
AI enables us to predict and prevent.

24
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,139
At Amazon, for example, we used a
predictive analytics to forecast

25
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,609
ASIN level product overrides
before they disrupted the sales,

26
00:01:35,059 --> 00:01:38,240
essentially intervening before
the customers felt the pain.

27
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,979
The same principle applies here, the
you need to automate the detection,

28
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,124
gain the full visibility, and then
proactively resolve the issues.

29
00:01:46,624 --> 00:01:49,835
Next is a comprehensive
data stream analysis.

30
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:53,494
To do this, AI systems must
ingest multiple streams of data.

31
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:57,934
For example, supplier metrics, the
transportation timelines, inventory

32
00:01:57,934 --> 00:02:01,085
flows, whether even geopolitical risks.

33
00:02:01,474 --> 00:02:04,684
No single analyst can connect
all these dots fast enough,

34
00:02:04,955 --> 00:02:05,554
but machine learning can.

35
00:02:06,054 --> 00:02:08,914
At Amazon, we often layer clickstream.

36
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:14,735
Supply chain and vendor data to get the
whole 360 degree view of operations.

37
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:20,675
This holistic perspective is what drives
early detection and smart interventions.

38
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:23,155
Next is machine learning
pattern recognition.

39
00:02:23,335 --> 00:02:25,855
Machine learning builds a
baseline of what's normal

40
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:27,445
looks like in your operations.

41
00:02:27,685 --> 00:02:32,135
Once that's established anomaly
stand out immediately, whether it's

42
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:35,775
a spike in transit delays or unusual
supply lead times that you have.

43
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,300
At Amazon anally detection models
helped us to identify when a particular

44
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,400
product class was deviating from its
usual demand supply chain pattern

45
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,120
leading us to adjust it before
escalating into a larger problem.

46
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,960
The key is moving from a
hand site to a foresight.

47
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,480
Next is ink.

48
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,100
Iot enabled real time
warehouse visibility.

49
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,830
Warehouses are the
heartbeat of supply chains.

50
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,060
The iot sensors make them
smarter by tracking everything.

51
00:03:04,495 --> 00:03:08,755
Like temperature, the humidity
and the vibration, and lot with

52
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,525
respect to equipment health as well.

53
00:03:10,975 --> 00:03:13,435
This data creates a
digital nervous system.

54
00:03:13,855 --> 00:03:18,385
For example, at Amazon, we tracked a
conveyor performance and environmental

55
00:03:18,385 --> 00:03:23,815
conditions to spot the bottlenecks before
the disrupted The order flow iot paid

56
00:03:23,815 --> 00:03:29,025
with AI enables us to prevent further
actions rather than a costly downtime.

57
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:32,015
Next is computer vision
and predictive maintenance.

58
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:34,655
Computer vision is like
giving eyes to machines.

59
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,720
It detects wear and tear patterns
in equipment, misaligned packages,

60
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,430
or early failure indicators.

61
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,160
Coupled with predictive maintenance
algorithms, organizations can

62
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,930
schedule fixes before breakdowns can
occur during mind time at Amazon.

63
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,740
The predictive maintenance on
sortation equipment saved us

64
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:56,400
countless hours of downtime and
directly impacted the delivery sles.

65
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,170
Next is reinforcement learning
for response optimization.

66
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:05,270
When incidents do occur, reinforcement
learning ensures the right response.

67
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,320
These systems learn from historical
responses, what worked, what

68
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,710
didn't, and optimize the routing
of alerts to the right teams.

69
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,140
Think of it as a continuously
learning playbook.

70
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,050
At Amazon, we often refined alert
routing logic to reduce the noise

71
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,740
for ops teams ensuring critical
incidents got immediate attention

72
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,345
while also avoiding the alert fatigue.

73
00:04:26,845 --> 00:04:29,305
Next is advanced predictive
escalation systems.

74
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:33,895
These systems don't just like flag
issues, they predict escalation.

75
00:04:33,955 --> 00:04:39,505
For example, models can anticipate when
an incident breach might when you know,

76
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:41,370
like when an incident might breach.

77
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,880
SLA thresholds and trigger
automated migration protocols.

78
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:47,335
Faster than even like human intervention.

79
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:51,355
So this is crucial in high velocity
businesses like Amazon where even

80
00:04:51,355 --> 00:04:55,165
few minutes of delay in addressing
the fulfillment incidents can cascade

81
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:57,750
into thousands of missed deliveries.

82
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,180
Next comes to the federated learning
for collaborative intelligence.

83
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,960
Supply chains aren't also, they're
not isolated, so they are as

84
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,060
they are ecosystems of partners.

85
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,150
Federated learning lets companies
share threat intelligence

86
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,950
without exposing sensitive data.

87
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,820
Imagine multiple partners contributing
insights on disruptions, collectively

88
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,230
strengthening the network.

89
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,530
In finance, we call this as
consortium data in supply chain.

90
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,060
It's basically a collaborative resilience.

91
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,390
Next two comes to the blockchain
integration for audit ID trails blockchain

92
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,910
ensures also the trust and compliance.

93
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,420
It provides immutable audit
trails and also enables the

94
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,110
faster and smarter contracts for
automated compliance reporting.

95
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:42,635
At Amazon, while we didn't use a
blockchain directly for incident

96
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:46,235
management, we heavily invested
in immutable logging for Audible.

97
00:05:46,835 --> 00:05:49,805
So similar in principle to the
blockchain, ensuring the integrity

98
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:51,335
across the large scale systems.

99
00:05:51,835 --> 00:05:54,145
Next is implementation
of strategy framework.

100
00:05:54,415 --> 00:05:57,295
Of course, transformation
requires a structured approach.

101
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,335
We need to start with
assessment around the pilots to

102
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:02,284
validate then scale gradually.

103
00:06:02,735 --> 00:06:06,695
At Amazon, we followed similar playbooks
when deploying the new data science tools.

104
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:11,315
Begin small through the impact
and then expand systematically.

105
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:15,065
Continuous optimization is
also always like vital as new

106
00:06:15,065 --> 00:06:16,775
risks and data patterns emerge.

107
00:06:17,275 --> 00:06:19,805
Next is operational benefits and impact.

108
00:06:20,305 --> 00:06:21,775
The benefits are tangible.

109
00:06:22,054 --> 00:06:24,364
Like they reduced meantime to resolution.

110
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:29,275
Fewer escalations higher C higher
service reliability at Amazon, every

111
00:06:29,275 --> 00:06:33,385
percentage point improvement in uptime
or delivery reliability translates

112
00:06:33,385 --> 00:06:37,164
into usually like millions of dollars
saved and the customer trust gains.

113
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,644
The same benefits extend here.

114
00:06:39,704 --> 00:06:43,334
Proactive systems save
time, money, and reputation.

115
00:06:44,094 --> 00:06:46,554
Finally, the future of
supply chain operations.

116
00:06:46,734 --> 00:06:49,624
The benefits are tangible here as well.

117
00:06:49,774 --> 00:06:53,324
So the future is about like
residence and then adaptability.

118
00:06:53,474 --> 00:06:57,284
AI will transform supply chains from
firefighting to foresight driven.

119
00:06:57,354 --> 00:06:58,254
Orchestration.

120
00:06:58,554 --> 00:07:03,504
Organizations that invest now will thrive
as networks get more global and complex.

121
00:07:03,804 --> 00:07:07,884
My experience at Amazon showed me
that scale and complexity demand

122
00:07:07,884 --> 00:07:10,524
nothing less than AI power solutions.

123
00:07:11,024 --> 00:07:12,644
Next is, thank you for your time.

124
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:16,924
So if you have any questions
feel free to drop an email to me.

125
00:07:16,954 --> 00:07:21,034
So my email is krishna c dot ya@gmail.com.

126
00:07:21,394 --> 00:07:21,604
Thank you.
