1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,840
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:01,590
This is Sand.

3
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:03,930
hope everybody having a good time.

4
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,360
Today I wanna talk about the how
to enhance our payments using ai.

5
00:00:10,209 --> 00:00:13,390
I'm gonna give some important
points here, important notes, and

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:18,070
then I wanna run through, how we
can utilize the ai, and then, how

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,959
to make our life easy, basically.

8
00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:24,580
And then how to make our
payment sector very secure.

9
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:28,695
yeah, after this session, I hope
everybody get, knowledge and then

10
00:00:28,964 --> 00:00:30,364
so that, we can make, All secure.

11
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:35,045
So I wanna start, with, enhancing the
digital payment secure with ai, basically

12
00:00:35,045 --> 00:00:39,805
the global digital, payment, market is
supposed, exponential growth, but that

13
00:00:39,805 --> 00:00:42,445
comes to the i security risk basically.

14
00:00:42,865 --> 00:00:47,575
Um, you can do, with within the,
if with this presentation, I wanna

15
00:00:47,575 --> 00:00:48,865
go ahead and then, basically.

16
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,880
Show what kind of revolution payments,
security that we can run through,

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,420
and then so that we can do the, fraud
detection, productivity, analytics

18
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,130
and adapt to, threat mechanism.

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,590
yeah, I'm going through the, my second
slide so that, we can go further.

20
00:01:03,555 --> 00:01:05,855
The growth challenge of
digital payments, fraud.

21
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:10,345
Nowadays, there are two high risk that
we can do, or, the two components that

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,750
we have to take into consideration.

23
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,220
Number one is rapid growth.

24
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,190
that's what happening in digital world.

25
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,660
And then second thing, rising
in threats whenever you see.

26
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,010
There are a lot of growth that
are happening in any sector.

27
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,880
At the same time, we see the other side
of the coin, there is a rising threat.

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,220
So when it comes to the growth, what
kind of dis payment we, we are seeing,

29
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,100
the growth and then, we are, we're
experience unprecedented, expansion

30
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,630
in the, product search and then.

31
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:42,440
The projected, the surge
behind 15 trillion, by 2027.

32
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,280
This is a huge number.

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,720
And then this is the expensive
growth, basically field, where set

34
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,440
of odd options like, whatever the
contactless payment that we are doing.

35
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,790
And then, mobile wallet pairing,
payments, and then imaging

36
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,110
technologies like blockchain.

37
00:01:55,410 --> 00:02:00,070
Transforming how billions of people
worldwide, conduct in the transaction.

38
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,910
So the rapid growth happening with
all these things, but other side we

39
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,900
have a, a lot of, threats are rising.

40
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,220
The rising threats.

41
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:12,040
However, these, disablement
resolution as, attract sophisticated

42
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,310
cyber, cyber criminals,
basically, and then leading alarm.

43
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,430
rise in a fraud.

44
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:24,070
So experts predicted annual loss, from
payments fraud will be skyrocketed.

45
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:30,480
48 billion, dollars by 2 25 with,
attacking become increasingly complex,

46
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,350
harder, detecting using the traditional
security measure what we have right now.

47
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,670
What do we have to do to get this,
payment secure and then to make the

48
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,470
things better for the human life?

49
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,875
so AI power of, power of fraud
detection, is a, usually a game changer

50
00:02:45,205 --> 00:02:48,355
where we can detect the threats,
with using the AI automatically.

51
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:53,345
So the one, the three things that we
could do, one is a deep learning model.

52
00:02:53,535 --> 00:02:56,655
basically AI power fraud
detection model, leveraging the.

53
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:01,215
Deep learning and behavioral bio
biometrics and having demonstrated

54
00:03:01,245 --> 00:03:06,185
an 80% of improvement in detection,
the suspicious transactions compared

55
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,865
to traditional rule methods.

56
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:11,315
And second thing, what we
can do enhance accuracy.

57
00:03:11,345 --> 00:03:12,575
So machine learning algorithm.

58
00:03:13,075 --> 00:03:17,895
So using the mechanism, machine learning
algorithms, analyzing the, vast data

59
00:03:17,895 --> 00:03:25,475
sets, identifying the MS and unauthorized,
access with the 98% of SIG significantly,

60
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:27,825
reducing false positive basically.

61
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:30,795
So we see nowadays is a lot
of false positive situations.

62
00:03:30,855 --> 00:03:34,125
And then using the, enhancing the
accuracy using the machine learning,

63
00:03:34,405 --> 00:03:36,150
algorithm so we can basically.

64
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,500
detected these things, very easily.

65
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,980
And then the third one we can
think of is productive analytics.

66
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,790
AI driven product analytics
helps financial institution and

67
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,340
anticipated fraud threats, right?

68
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:53,350
So reducing the potential losses
by up to 12 billion annually.

69
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,230
So this is how we can do
the productive analytics.

70
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,954
more to the next slide.

71
00:03:58,454 --> 00:04:03,075
the a, another thing, what we can
achieve is realtime transaction

72
00:04:03,404 --> 00:04:06,135
monitoring and bio metric authentication.

73
00:04:06,135 --> 00:04:07,454
So realtime monitoring.

74
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:12,385
So using the advanced AI power
transaction, monitoring has slashed.

75
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:16,575
Fraud incident by 30% across
the financial network.

76
00:04:16,575 --> 00:04:21,555
So what the ability to analyze
over 20,000 transaction per second.

77
00:04:21,555 --> 00:04:25,695
The flags suspicious
activity within milliseconds.

78
00:04:25,695 --> 00:04:27,525
So that's what we can do
with the realtime monitoring.

79
00:04:27,555 --> 00:04:31,485
And then another stuff we can do,
biometric authentication, next generation,

80
00:04:31,485 --> 00:04:33,135
biometric identification, combine.

81
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,059
AI with the multiple verification
methods, so including, facial

82
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:42,109
recognition and, fingerprint
scanning, and then wise patterns.

83
00:04:42,109 --> 00:04:47,359
So with this, we can achieve 99
points of, 99.9 accuracy with

84
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:51,679
a reducing, authentication time
to under almost two seconds.

85
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:55,450
So this is multimodal approach
that, cut, parental access and

86
00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:00,369
attempt by 85% of while maintaining
the seamless user experience.

87
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,289
let's move on to the next one.

88
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:05,539
the main thing is the
blockchain, a new, frontier.

89
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,449
For securing the digital payments.

90
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:08,949
So there are two things, right?

91
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:12,169
So zero knowledge, proof,
and then, you know, learning.

92
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:16,969
So Revolution AI powered blockchain
security protocol utilizes zero

93
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:21,499
knowledge proof to validate transaction
with a hundred percent accuracy.

94
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:24,524
That's huge number, that's like
a perfect a hundred percent while

95
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:27,030
maintaining the complete data privacy.

96
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,760
This breakthrough is the
technology enabling the financial

97
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,930
institution process over.

98
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:35,034
10,000 transaction per
second, that's fast.

99
00:05:35,484 --> 00:05:38,754
And while ensuring the sensitivity
customers information remain

100
00:05:38,754 --> 00:05:43,104
fully, encrypted and protected, so
using this zero knowledge proof,

101
00:05:43,104 --> 00:05:44,455
you can achieve good things.

102
00:05:44,874 --> 00:05:49,224
Another one, federated learning,
through advanced learning system

103
00:05:49,494 --> 00:05:51,414
bank and payment providers.

104
00:05:51,715 --> 00:05:55,785
Can now collaborate to strengthen their,
collective defense again, against fraud.

105
00:05:56,115 --> 00:06:01,155
So sharing AI model improvement
without explanation customer data,

106
00:06:01,455 --> 00:06:06,075
this distribute approach has helped
and better institution reduce fraud.

107
00:06:06,594 --> 00:06:09,414
65% while maintaining street data.

108
00:06:09,624 --> 00:06:11,364
and regulatory complaints.

109
00:06:11,364 --> 00:06:13,934
So those things we can
achieve, with the blockchain.

110
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:17,094
And then, the, I wanna move on to the
next slide and explain the industry

111
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:20,924
success stories, demonstrating
the AI impact, what we could do,

112
00:06:21,264 --> 00:06:23,154
using the AI and then the industry.

113
00:06:23,654 --> 00:06:24,434
Success stories.

114
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:26,114
number one is reduce charge.

115
00:06:26,164 --> 00:06:29,874
chargeback, leading a financial
institution have, reported

116
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:34,254
dramatically 40% of reduction
in chargeback fraud through,

117
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:36,784
sophisticated, AI driven detect system.

118
00:06:36,784 --> 00:06:37,534
That's a huge number.

119
00:06:37,534 --> 00:06:42,424
So we are now, we're getting the
40% reduction in chargeback fraud,

120
00:06:42,454 --> 00:06:48,034
and the major credit card provides
implementing the solutions save over 2.3.

121
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,219
Billion in fraud climb while
maintain the customer trend

122
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:54,589
satisfaction rates about 95%.

123
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,719
So that's a huge numbers there.

124
00:06:57,109 --> 00:06:59,839
And then second thing is the
enhanced transaction speed.

125
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,149
So the success story,
another success story.

126
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:06,419
We can do enhanced transaction,
by 28% using the AI algorithm.

127
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:10,529
And then if you look at the
crossing time, it is 3.2 seconds.

128
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:11,849
just eight minutes, seconds.

129
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:15,719
A leading 30% increase in
customer, compliance, completion

130
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:18,689
rate and significantly higher
merchant satisfaction score.

131
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:22,409
So yeah, reduce chargebacks and
then, enhanced transaction speed.

132
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:26,309
Those are, big things that, you
know, we can achieve with the ai.

133
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:28,049
And then let monitor next one.

134
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:31,649
And merging AI trends shaping
the future of payment security.

135
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:38,554
So what is a. The trends that we are
seeing right now for the future of secure

136
00:07:38,554 --> 00:07:39,964
the payments, any kind of payments.

137
00:07:39,964 --> 00:07:44,714
So quantum security, encryption, and
then advertiser, ai, defense mechanism.

138
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,824
These two we can use.

139
00:07:45,824 --> 00:07:48,554
And then that's the AI trends
that we are looking right now.

140
00:07:48,854 --> 00:07:53,564
The advent, of quantum computer necessity,
quantum secure encryption algorithm

141
00:07:53,564 --> 00:07:55,754
to protect the IGN potential attacks.

142
00:07:55,994 --> 00:07:58,034
And then AI plays a big role in this.

143
00:07:58,314 --> 00:08:00,774
so dial up and then, use
the encryption method.

144
00:08:00,774 --> 00:08:01,464
Those are things.

145
00:08:01,744 --> 00:08:02,754
And, AI driven.

146
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:07,744
The second one, aal AI defense
mechanism, AI driven defense mechanism

147
00:08:07,804 --> 00:08:14,704
are evolving to proactively combat
arisal attacks, such as defects and

148
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:20,054
knowledge, ensuring, less resilience of
payment system, sophisticated threat.

149
00:08:20,554 --> 00:08:22,404
Okay, let's move on to the
important thing, AI role.

150
00:08:22,904 --> 00:08:25,304
Building a safer digital
financial ecosystem.

151
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:30,734
So what we could do to build a
safer digital financial ecosystem

152
00:08:30,794 --> 00:08:32,654
using the ai, what is the AI role?

153
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:36,284
So the, we can think of
three, three things right now.

154
00:08:36,334 --> 00:08:40,524
the enhanced security, improved
efficiency and has a customer experience.

155
00:08:40,524 --> 00:08:45,094
So by the looking at these things,
With using the ai, the financial

156
00:08:45,304 --> 00:08:49,264
institution pro proactively detect
the payment fraud, and then it'll help

157
00:08:49,264 --> 00:08:53,554
the financial institution and then
consumer and everybody, the customer,

158
00:08:53,554 --> 00:08:55,594
everybody, and then improve efficiency.

159
00:08:55,594 --> 00:09:00,694
So AI driven automation, seamless
process leading to faster transaction,

160
00:09:00,694 --> 00:09:03,604
reduce the cost, and then more
efficient financial ecosystem.

161
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:06,469
And then the third one is
enhance the customer service.

162
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:10,499
So end of the day, the customer,
customer experience is a main priority.

163
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:14,709
So using the AI power solution
improved, you can basically, the

164
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:18,550
customer can feel more secure and
then, we can do like a seamless payment

165
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,749
processing and while minimizing the
friction and enhancing convenience.

166
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,430
The future payment security, how it
is looking in future payment security,

167
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,130
a collaborative, what we could do
to achieve this, and then, what

168
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,840
is our approach we should follow.

169
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,490
Across industry partnership.

170
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,020
Let's establish a dynamic partnership
between the banks and then FinTech

171
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,530
companies and cyber security experts
to create a integral different,

172
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,180
defense security that rapidly
share the, intelligent at best

173
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,310
practice and practices basically.

174
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,470
And second thing is
breakthrough technologies.

175
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,685
Investing a cutting edge in
cutting edge ai, and then

176
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:54,035
machine learning solution that.

177
00:09:54,065 --> 00:09:59,195
Predict the, imaging cybersecurity threats
and while adapting to evolving payment

178
00:09:59,195 --> 00:10:01,225
technologies, and consumer behavior.

179
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:03,325
And third one is smart governance.

180
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:09,235
developing the, flexible yet robust,
regulatory, standards and the

181
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:16,105
balance, innovation with the consumer
protection, ensuring AI system remains.

182
00:10:16,605 --> 00:10:18,405
Transparent, accountable.

183
00:10:18,405 --> 00:10:21,895
And then, it is make sure that the
global compliance requirement met.

184
00:10:22,395 --> 00:10:27,245
So that above all, there, the, what
are the key takeaways from this,

185
00:10:27,245 --> 00:10:30,495
and then what are the next steps
we have to do to make it, this ai,

186
00:10:30,585 --> 00:10:35,255
works good for us and, it's good for
the make it, the cybersecurity safe.

187
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:39,625
The AI revolution in action, the first
thing that we discussed and that AI

188
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:44,655
technologies have demonstrated transform,
result direction of fraud, by cutting up

189
00:10:44,655 --> 00:10:51,020
to 63% while processing the transaction
for faster and making, the account,

190
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,095
the account register payment platform.

191
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:57,735
the second thing is power of,
partnership, success, demand, strategies,

192
00:10:57,735 --> 00:11:01,155
collaboration between the financial
institution like I, like we discussed,

193
00:11:01,155 --> 00:11:06,625
and then expertise, cyber security
expertise, ensure defense, in depth.

194
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:10,775
And then using the AI methods, and
then, partnership between the FinTech

195
00:11:10,775 --> 00:11:12,065
companies, we can achieve this.

196
00:11:12,065 --> 00:11:15,815
And then building tomorrow's
trust by implementing a driven

197
00:11:15,815 --> 00:11:17,615
security solution today.

198
00:11:17,805 --> 00:11:22,695
We are creating a future while digital
payments are not just faster, more

199
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:27,045
efficient, but fundamentally secure,
trustworthy for all participants.

200
00:11:27,545 --> 00:11:31,625
So by coming to the conclusion
towards, the secure and, the future,

201
00:11:31,685 --> 00:11:35,035
all the stuff, what we discussed so
far, what is the conclusion about ai?

202
00:11:35,155 --> 00:11:36,175
How we transformed?

203
00:11:36,365 --> 00:11:39,485
AI has transformed from theoretical
concept to the powerful.

204
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,610
Four, reshaping and then using the
AI technologies and then intelligent,

205
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,130
there are a lot of mechanism
that AI doing right, right now.

206
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,530
like we discussed, fraud
detection, realtime monitoring,

207
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,090
and intelligent authentication.

208
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,520
So these are stuff we can use and then we
can use this AI in good way where it'll

209
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,620
ease our transactions with a secure,
and then basically the future of digital

210
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,680
payments isn't just bright, so it's here.

211
00:12:07,245 --> 00:12:10,355
So digital payments, we wanna
make the digital payments bright.

212
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,295
So it's here, it is being
safeguarded by the unstoppable

213
00:12:13,295 --> 00:12:16,445
combination of human expertise
and, artificial inte intelligence.

214
00:12:17,165 --> 00:12:19,145
So that's conclude my presentation.

215
00:12:19,195 --> 00:12:22,085
hope you know, everybody got
some knowledge and and thanks

216
00:12:22,085 --> 00:12:23,165
for the opportunity here.

217
00:12:23,225 --> 00:12:24,485
And then, have a good day.

218
00:12:24,605 --> 00:12:24,965
Thank you.
