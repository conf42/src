1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,540
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,420
Thanks for joining the session today.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,360
I would like to talk about
predictive maintenance using

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,740
iot and machine learning.

5
00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:14,120
Basically, it involves the sensors, the
realtime data collection the analytics

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,509
using machine learning, and it covers
a bit of future respects as well.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,279
Okay, I have split the
agenda into these categories.

8
00:00:24,165 --> 00:00:28,334
First, the types of maintenance
and what is predictive maintenance?

9
00:00:28,514 --> 00:00:31,694
The sensors, the market, the
challenges and the future direction,

10
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:34,995
and also the machine learning part.

11
00:00:36,194 --> 00:00:36,434
Yeah.

12
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:39,614
When you look at a, an industrial
equipment that's installed in a

13
00:00:39,614 --> 00:00:44,864
factory or a manufacturing unit or
the one that is used, transformers

14
00:00:44,864 --> 00:00:46,874
that are used for power supply.

15
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:50,594
There are multiple types of
maintenance that are available.

16
00:00:51,414 --> 00:00:57,095
Typically the one that is done is
a breakdown maintenance, like where

17
00:00:57,485 --> 00:01:01,625
after we see a failure, we react to
it and start the maintenance process.

18
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:04,434
Like we call the company that
maintains it and the spare

19
00:01:04,434 --> 00:01:06,144
parts that are needed and so on.

20
00:01:06,564 --> 00:01:07,704
So that is breakdown maintenance.

21
00:01:09,324 --> 00:01:11,544
The other one is preventive maintenance.

22
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:15,924
It is like periodic maintenance that
we do, like an oil change for the car.

23
00:01:16,074 --> 00:01:20,164
There's nothing that's broken down,
but still you, you just want to

24
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:23,074
ensure that it runs properly and
you do a preventive maintenance.

25
00:01:23,074 --> 00:01:27,304
This is mostly done on a schedule,
like quarterly or annually

26
00:01:27,764 --> 00:01:28,845
depending on the equipment.

27
00:01:29,865 --> 00:01:36,995
And what we find is one a PC study,
they said they found that more

28
00:01:36,995 --> 00:01:39,095
than 80% of failures are random.

29
00:01:39,465 --> 00:01:42,135
So you can't cover them
in preventive maintenance.

30
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:45,825
And of course, if it breaks down,
you have to do breakdown maintenance.

31
00:01:46,035 --> 00:01:48,925
Here comes the the power
of predictive maintenance.

32
00:01:50,035 --> 00:01:56,685
Now we have IOT sensors, which simple like
a microphone or a proximity switch or a.

33
00:01:57,274 --> 00:02:02,264
A simple vibration sensor, which
can basically monitor or gather the

34
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:08,444
the broad data like a sound or the
vibrations, and which can be intelligently

35
00:02:08,444 --> 00:02:10,124
analyzed using ML algorithms.

36
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,239
And you can predict even before the
equipment goes into breakdown that it's

37
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:21,179
going fail and without any downtime, you
can do a prevent preventative maintenance.

38
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:25,109
That's, that is called us predictive
maintenance sensors have matured greatly.

39
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:27,130
They use less and less of power.

40
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,990
They have a more accuracy has
increased and you can measure

41
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,300
various parameters like sound.

42
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:38,269
The vibration, as I mentioned,
temperature, pressure, humidity,

43
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:40,579
and this is real time, right?

44
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:43,279
Like when the mission is running
or the equipment is running, you

45
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:47,629
collect the data and we are pushing
it into cloud or some data lake where

46
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:48,980
you can gather all the information.

47
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:54,230
And now with the advancements of
ai, we have sophisticated machine

48
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,399
learning algorithms, which can process
these detect anomalies and report

49
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:00,019
as perform predictive maintenance.

50
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,330
The key benefits of IOT based
maintenance are, of course, like we,

51
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,959
we predicted early before it happens.

52
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:12,039
And even though there is a downtime,
you can schedule it like in

53
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:15,304
non-business hours or something
that doesn't have much of an impact.

54
00:03:15,304 --> 00:03:17,795
And to be relatively less.

55
00:03:18,185 --> 00:03:20,320
And to add to that, in case the.

56
00:03:21,844 --> 00:03:23,704
There is a predictive
maintenance part of it.

57
00:03:24,094 --> 00:03:27,785
The technician who comes in comes
with the right part that is needed.

58
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:31,505
So there is no back and forth to
go for, go searching of the parts,

59
00:03:31,505 --> 00:03:32,825
finding out what's gone wrong.

60
00:03:33,064 --> 00:03:38,194
He comes and does a surgical maintenance,
so that reduces the downtime.

61
00:03:39,575 --> 00:03:45,794
Of course, it saves a lot of cost about
25 to 30% and then since it's maintained

62
00:03:45,794 --> 00:03:47,534
even before a breakdown happens.

63
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,279
The equipments lifespan increases greatly.

64
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:57,060
And finally, what our feedback is
gathered by the predictive maintenance

65
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:03,510
can be fed back into the design table
so that the next products that are

66
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,159
iterated by the company can incorporate
all the findings that they have in

67
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,700
real time into their next design,
which basically evolves their product.

68
00:04:12,824 --> 00:04:14,024
PTC is a company.

69
00:04:14,114 --> 00:04:18,654
We just got a, which is very good in
microphone monitor, acoustic monitoring.

70
00:04:18,684 --> 00:04:23,154
Basically they can be deployed
anywhere and it can be retrofit or

71
00:04:23,154 --> 00:04:27,804
it can be deployed on an existing
missionary without disrupting, making

72
00:04:27,804 --> 00:04:29,514
a lot of changes around, around that.

73
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:33,204
You can just go and place it on a
relatively benign spot and you can

74
00:04:33,204 --> 00:04:34,524
start gathering the information.

75
00:04:35,424 --> 00:04:39,614
It's non-invasive and, it basically
continuously sense data, which

76
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:41,294
are compared by the ML algorithms.

77
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:42,474
I will see about it later.

78
00:04:42,534 --> 00:04:47,564
Further broadly it's it's
first data collection.

79
00:04:47,594 --> 00:04:50,874
Getting the operational equipment
footprint, basically the creating the

80
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,494
acoustic footprint of the equipment.

81
00:04:52,894 --> 00:04:55,744
It's like a thermal map or a,
something like that to imagine.

82
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,284
And the data is collected
continuously, so it's real time.

83
00:04:59,854 --> 00:05:01,204
And, it's multimodal, right?

84
00:05:01,204 --> 00:05:05,905
Like it has got the sound profile, it's
got the vibration profile, it's got the

85
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:10,234
temperature profile, so it's multimodal
which can produce a very complex pattern.

86
00:05:10,294 --> 00:05:13,859
Like you can combine all these to
find out precisely what's going on.

87
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:16,159
And what needs to be maintained.

88
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:20,119
And the data can be compared like,
say for example, a company which

89
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,289
is manufacturing the equipment.

90
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:24,889
They can compare it with previous failures
or previous maintenance that they have

91
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:29,469
done, and which can reduce the false
positives and enhancing the credibility

92
00:05:29,469 --> 00:05:31,989
of the the preventative maintenance.

93
00:05:32,989 --> 00:05:33,169
Yeah.

94
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:34,999
Now we have the sensors.

95
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,549
How do we integrate the machine learning?

96
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:42,979
When you see the diagram, it basically,
there is a data acquisition part and

97
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:44,929
there is a signal processing part.

98
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:52,009
And third is the the signal is set
to a machine learning model and.

99
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:55,999
We also have something called
as h computing integration to

100
00:05:55,999 --> 00:06:00,399
reduce the network latency and
feedback for the model refinement.

101
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:05,584
When you see I. Again, it cal collects
all the data that is the first point.

102
00:06:05,944 --> 00:06:10,354
And signal processing is, as an example,
it is converting an amplitude of a

103
00:06:10,354 --> 00:06:14,718
frequency into a time series data,
basically converting the frequency,

104
00:06:14,718 --> 00:06:18,018
converting it into frequency domain so
that the ML model can better analyze that.

105
00:06:18,198 --> 00:06:21,108
So it can look at the
peaks where it is speaking.

106
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:24,013
But for just with, without the
amplitude they can look for

107
00:06:24,013 --> 00:06:25,843
the frequency time series also.

108
00:06:26,593 --> 00:06:26,743
Yeah.

109
00:06:26,983 --> 00:06:30,703
And we can train the machine, learn
models with the different algorithms

110
00:06:31,003 --> 00:06:34,483
like random forest, CNN, to predict
anomalies, and maintenance needs.

111
00:06:34,993 --> 00:06:37,933
Yeah, edge computing is very
interesting because these sensors,

112
00:06:38,293 --> 00:06:39,763
they collect a lot of data.

113
00:06:40,118 --> 00:06:43,628
We can collect every second, and there
are some which collect in milliseconds,

114
00:06:44,018 --> 00:06:48,248
and you can of course configure
them, but you can do a localized

115
00:06:48,248 --> 00:06:51,158
signal processing instead of sending
the raw data directly through the

116
00:06:51,218 --> 00:06:53,048
network and kind of overloading it.

117
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:57,408
So you can reduce you can just
process the signal here and

118
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:00,808
eliminate what is not needed and
transformations that are needed.

119
00:07:01,078 --> 00:07:04,948
And you can reduce the, by
doing this, you can reduce the.

120
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:09,428
The number of data the amount of data
that we transfer over the network

121
00:07:09,788 --> 00:07:11,498
and basically to reduce the latency.

122
00:07:11,658 --> 00:07:14,238
So basically you can find out
what's going on pretty fast,

123
00:07:14,298 --> 00:07:17,058
relatively, and model refinement.

124
00:07:17,098 --> 00:07:20,308
They keep on increasing, it's possible
to keep on increasing the prediction

125
00:07:20,308 --> 00:07:24,718
accuracy through adaptive learning
and supervised learning as well.

126
00:07:25,108 --> 00:07:26,128
So this is how it works.

127
00:07:26,218 --> 00:07:29,458
Basically, we collect the sensor,
we signal process it, and affect

128
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:30,538
the machine learning model.

129
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:33,918
And if needed, we use the most
of it will have an edge computing

130
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:36,228
integration to reduce the network load.

131
00:07:36,528 --> 00:07:40,458
And finally, there is a supervised
component to improve the model security

132
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:45,458
because you start with something that is
a false pass, it keeps on maturing and the

133
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,738
data can be made available on a dashboard.

134
00:07:47,828 --> 00:07:51,578
And there can also be alerts that can
be triggered on a mobile phone, like

135
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,468
for a service engineer as an example.

136
00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:56,508
Yeah, it's got multiple application areas.

137
00:07:56,568 --> 00:07:58,998
I think maybe you already sensed it.

138
00:07:59,558 --> 00:08:02,148
It can be applied in manufacturing.

139
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:08,743
If there is a say a bottling plant or if
there is a emissions that are running.

140
00:08:09,213 --> 00:08:12,933
So in manufacturing basically, and
energy, like where there are the

141
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:17,133
turbines running and you can measure
the transformers frequency, the data

142
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:19,293
image, to find out if it's going to fail.

143
00:08:19,383 --> 00:08:21,783
Using the predictive analytics,
because we have the sophisticated

144
00:08:21,783 --> 00:08:27,014
algorithms to even detect a very
minor anomaly which is real, not of

145
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:29,054
all positive, and you can act on it.

146
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:31,154
And logistics per fleet management?

147
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:33,534
Large trucks, 18 wheelers, they carry.

148
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:38,839
There are so you can monitor it pretty
much because by avoiding failures

149
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,589
in that and maintaining it with
predictions, ML based predictions, you

150
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:47,719
can avoid failures and can ensure that
the SUP supply chain is not impacted.

151
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:51,679
It has got other applications
also like automobile, like there

152
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,939
are, there is a, in cars, they're
used as a vascular health systems.

153
00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:01,518
And oil and gas industry as we discussed,
it could be used in railways basically

154
00:09:01,518 --> 00:09:06,529
where, because that's a public transport
or it could be a good stream which

155
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:10,939
carries goods like, so those things
before they, if they break, they cause

156
00:09:11,238 --> 00:09:14,029
downtime and supply chain issues.

157
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:17,489
We can, it can be predictive,
it can be maintained in using

158
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:20,009
prediction and utilities.

159
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:22,499
Of course, electricity,
we already saw gas.

160
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:26,679
Anything that that comes to us
through internet can be monitored.

161
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:27,889
Yeah.

162
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:36,079
Compared to 2020, the market has
grown or projected to grow 400%.

163
00:09:36,484 --> 00:09:40,834
So it was about $7 billion
in 2020 and it's going to go

164
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:44,014
more than $28 billion in 2026.

165
00:09:44,104 --> 00:09:46,364
'cause there are a lot of
advantages to this approach.

166
00:09:46,704 --> 00:09:50,894
Easy to sensors are easier,
non-invasive can easily implement it.

167
00:09:51,254 --> 00:09:54,164
And integration with the
maturing of machine learning, the

168
00:09:54,164 --> 00:09:55,694
prediction accuracy is pretty high.

169
00:09:55,994 --> 00:09:59,394
So thereby you can,
you can avoid downtime.

170
00:09:59,544 --> 00:10:03,404
So there is a lot of investment going on
and even new equipments that are, that

171
00:10:03,404 --> 00:10:07,914
already come with prebuilt sensors, which
could be used for predictive monitoring.

172
00:10:08,414 --> 00:10:13,704
Some of the studies aggregated show
that there is a 50% downtime reduction

173
00:10:14,254 --> 00:10:15,814
because of predictive mainten.

174
00:10:16,384 --> 00:10:18,574
And of course there's cost savings.

175
00:10:18,874 --> 00:10:20,584
It's more than 30%, but.

176
00:10:21,064 --> 00:10:25,874
Typically it's 30% around
30% and uptime, right?

177
00:10:25,874 --> 00:10:29,024
The mission is available for
manufacturing, which basically caters

178
00:10:29,024 --> 00:10:34,114
to the, or makes the company efficient
trustworthy to deliver on time.

179
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,074
It increases by 60%.

180
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:41,929
So what it means is if there were no
predictive maintenance, then they, there

181
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:43,969
would be a 60% reduction in efficiency.

182
00:10:43,969 --> 00:10:47,419
So because of implementation
of the predictive maintenance

183
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:50,869
using iot, industrial iot, the
company profitable as well.

184
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:53,389
Yeah.

185
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:58,429
Some of the challenges to implement
this is typically these factories or

186
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:03,069
the whole systems have some mindset
of, traditional reactive maintenance.

187
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:07,989
So to, to change the mindset and
come to a concept of predictive

188
00:11:07,989 --> 00:11:12,319
maintenance can be challenging
because my, my system is working fine.

189
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:14,809
Why should I certainly
do it before it happens?

190
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:19,104
So that is the mindset, but we have to
educate them to come up to the speed.

191
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:22,059
And there is a lot of skill gap.

192
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:27,139
In, in terms of people who monitor it in
case like the companies themselves decide

193
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:31,299
to monitor it centrally or so people
who understand iot technologies, data

194
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:35,669
analytics, and even acoustics, like in
case there is a relocation of a mission.

195
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:39,239
So there is a skill gap in
this, and the most important

196
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:40,739
is the cybersecurity concerns.

197
00:11:41,114 --> 00:11:49,934
Like the IOTs devices are highly prone to
cybersecurity attacks because the, there

198
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:54,609
are no frequent updates, like unlike a
desktop or a. System that's maintained.

199
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:57,999
All these iot sensor are just a
fit and forget kind of things.

200
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:02,634
And so they always tend to get old
or not up to speed to the current.

201
00:12:02,714 --> 00:12:04,664
There are no frequent updates to that.

202
00:12:04,664 --> 00:12:06,374
And they make them vulnerable.

203
00:12:06,924 --> 00:12:09,384
The certificates expire
or they become legacy.

204
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:11,274
Yeah.

205
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:14,424
And the data that comes out
of the system is massive.

206
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:18,629
Because these are all sensors
it is it's going to just bombard

207
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:20,249
the system with so much of data.

208
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:24,409
So it requires maybe a data
like solution and sometimes you

209
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:25,519
may not get the data as well.

210
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,469
So it needs that kind of an object
storage system, like an AWS S3,

211
00:12:29,469 --> 00:12:34,189
which can handle large volumes
of data, creating a retrofitting

212
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:36,299
old industrial equipment sensors.

213
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:39,749
Could, because it's a old system, like
we may not have the profile it has

214
00:12:39,749 --> 00:12:41,429
got its own implementation challenges.

215
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:42,079
Challenges.

216
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:46,049
So there's a lot of homework that needs
to be done to successfully integrate a

217
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:49,579
legacy system, which kind of very old to
to this predictive maintenance system.

218
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:56,209
The future looks bright, so you can have
a. Can have a technician come up with

219
00:12:56,209 --> 00:13:00,929
the AR and virtual reality augmented
reality so he can, when he looks at

220
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:06,899
the machine, he can see, he can be
guided by the machine or by a person

221
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:12,189
who's an expert, different geography,
location, to precisely go the things

222
00:13:12,189 --> 00:13:14,004
that he needs to do to fix the system.

223
00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:18,569
And you can have virtual models
that's got a digital twins that's

224
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:22,219
coming up and yeah the models
currently they're supervised, right?

225
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:27,409
So when the models eventually mature more
and more, they'll start to learn itself

226
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,279
like teach itself or to become better.

227
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:33,709
And there are a lot of cloud
platforms that basically companies

228
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:38,849
which are generic and they offer
predictive maintenance for multiple.

229
00:13:38,849 --> 00:13:44,019
So that's a evolving model that's coming
up which will basically an outsourcing

230
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:47,049
sort of the company themselves only it
or the manufacturer of the equipment.

231
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,829
It could be a third party cloud
platform that could take care

232
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,119
of it for different systems.

233
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:53,714
So to conclude the.

234
00:13:55,104 --> 00:13:58,884
Predictive maintenance using iot
delivers unprecedented insights

235
00:13:59,154 --> 00:14:00,834
and operational excellence.

236
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:03,374
And it's going to grow in the future.

237
00:14:03,824 --> 00:14:07,974
And a lot of equipments, even some
that are at home will eventually

238
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:11,334
be having some kind of predictive
maintenance in the future.

239
00:14:12,804 --> 00:14:16,744
And they deliver a actionable,
intelligent intelligent plan.

240
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:22,244
To call to action, to to resolve the
issues which will basically ensure

241
00:14:22,244 --> 00:14:26,804
the overall reliability of most
of the systems, thereby increasing

242
00:14:26,804 --> 00:14:31,444
the the quality of life, making
the company's profitable and so on.

243
00:14:32,344 --> 00:14:35,709
Yeah, I have added some
references which would go through.

244
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:36,459
Hope you like it.

245
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:37,839
Yeah.

246
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:39,069
Thank you very much.
