1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,250
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:02,990
Thanks so much for joining today.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,240
Before we go further, a little bit
about me, I'm Dennis Thema de Ulu.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,760
Welcome to my talk.

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,320
So let's start.

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,600
I'm here to talk about something
that honestly keep me awake at night

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,180
and know it's not DI in products and
code at 3M that also held horrific.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,500
But what keeps me up
thinking that is cloud build.

9
00:00:26,265 --> 00:00:29,805
Especially what's going to happen
to our cloud wells when quantum

10
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:31,755
computing become mainstream.

11
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:37,065
So let me start with a story that
happened to me just last month

12
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:42,194
that made me realize we are heading
for a perfect storm of confusions.

13
00:00:43,035 --> 00:00:47,795
So picture this one day I
hear about a person panicking.

14
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:53,645
She looking at her AWS bill and it
says around $10,000 for last month.

15
00:00:54,145 --> 00:00:57,625
Her startup entirely
was, that is $2,000 only.

16
00:00:58,435 --> 00:01:03,265
So what happened, one tiny mistake
in her auto scaling configurations.

17
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:09,295
Instead of scaling up to five servers,
it is scaled up to 50 and instead of

18
00:01:09,295 --> 00:01:13,495
running for two hours, it runs for
three days before anyone noticed.

19
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:19,585
So we were sitting there looking at
this bill, trying to figure out what

20
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:22,255
net gateway's processing charge means.

21
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:27,535
And why is he paying for CloudWatch
logs data and what the hell is

22
00:01:27,715 --> 00:01:29,785
load balance of capacity unit?

23
00:01:30,285 --> 00:01:32,685
And that's when it hit me.

24
00:01:33,185 --> 00:01:38,705
If we can't predict cost with the regular
computer technologies we have been using

25
00:01:38,705 --> 00:01:43,535
for decades, then what's going to happen
when quantum computers enters the picture?

26
00:01:44,035 --> 00:01:49,015
Let's be honest here, nobody, and I mean
nobody actually understand their bills.

27
00:01:49,515 --> 00:01:54,275
You got computer charges, storage
charges, network egress charges,

28
00:01:54,635 --> 00:01:56,885
network ingress charges and wait.

29
00:01:57,245 --> 00:02:04,265
They charge you for data incoming to, then
there are, there's also cross availability

30
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:07,805
zone transfer and API gateway request.

31
00:02:08,255 --> 00:02:14,255
Lambda called start penalties database,
lead capacity unit, and so on.

32
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,910
I once up lined with I items
for ideal load balancer time.

33
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,750
And my load balancer was not working
hard enough, and they decided to

34
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,820
charge me for its lack of motivation.

35
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,240
But here's the real problem.

36
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,780
Try this experiment right now.

37
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:38,020
Open your cloud dashboard and tell me
exactly not approximately, not around

38
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,040
$800, exactly what you'll spend.

39
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,520
Next month you can't do it.

40
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,600
Nobody can.

41
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,660
And this is what with technology,
we understand pretty well.

42
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,680
We know how CCP works,
we know how memory works.

43
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,840
We have been optimizing
these things for decades now.

44
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,020
Amazing.

45
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:05,085
Adding quantum to this equation,
here's a review of what's

46
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:06,885
coming and why you should care.

47
00:03:06,915 --> 00:03:11,415
Even if you never plan to touch
a quantum computer, your quantum

48
00:03:11,415 --> 00:03:16,095
algorithm might solve your problem
in 30 seconds or even in 30 hours.

49
00:03:16,815 --> 00:03:19,185
There literally no way to no be.

50
00:03:19,685 --> 00:03:21,905
It might do, it might re,

51
00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:26,140
yeah, it might need to run
once to get the perfect answer.

52
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,810
It might need to run 500 times,
become quantum mechanics,

53
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,690
decide to be difficult that day.

54
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:39,100
It might use basic quantum operations
that cost little bit, or it might

55
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,020
need expensive quantum errors.

56
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,450
Correction that cost a hundred times more.

57
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,480
And though all this, the
cloud providers is going to.

58
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,870
For every second of processing time,
for every detra, for every error

59
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,330
correction, and for every failed attempts.

60
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:03,730
The same quantum job could cost you
$500 to $5,000, and you wouldn't

61
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,010
know which until you get the bill.

62
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:12,420
But before we talk about solutions, let me
explain exactly what quantum computing is

63
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,940
and why it create the billing nightmare.

64
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,630
Alright, let's get technical,
but I promise to keep it simple.

65
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,940
Regular computers, your computers,
your phones, your server

66
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,680
running, your applications.

67
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:31,440
They, you, they all use bits, a
bits either zero over, it's like

68
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,795
a switch either on or either off.

69
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,580
Simple, predictable, reliable,
as you can see in this slide.

70
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,930
Quantum computers use bits or qubits.

71
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,080
Now here where it get is interesting.

72
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,630
A qubit can be zero or one and
zero and one at the same time.

73
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,030
Think of it like a coin.

74
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,390
When you flip a coin, it
is spinning in the air.

75
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,400
Is it add or tail?

76
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,970
It actually both until it
lengths and you see the result.

77
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,070
A qubit is like a coin.

78
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:08,495
That can stay spinning until
you need to know the answer.

79
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:15,055
So this is called super position being
in multiple state simultaneously.

80
00:05:15,955 --> 00:05:17,125
Now, why does it matter?

81
00:05:17,605 --> 00:05:22,585
Because while the qubits is in super
position, it can explore multiple

82
00:05:22,585 --> 00:05:24,565
solution to your problem at the same time.

83
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:28,825
It's like having thousands of
computer working in parallel, but

84
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:31,075
they are all same quantum computer.

85
00:05:31,575 --> 00:05:34,275
So let me show you this with a example.

86
00:05:35,145 --> 00:05:40,995
Imagine you are trying to find a exit
in a maze, and the classical computer

87
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:46,845
approach this systematically, it'll
try path one, which leads to dead end.

88
00:05:47,355 --> 00:05:52,695
It will try part two, which also lead
to dead end, and he will try also

89
00:05:52,695 --> 00:05:54,875
part three, part four, and so on.

90
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:57,245
And until he found the exit.

91
00:05:57,745 --> 00:05:57,955
This.

92
00:05:58,135 --> 00:06:01,525
This takes proportional to the
number of paths needs to check,

93
00:06:02,025 --> 00:06:06,105
and at the same time, the quantum
computer can be much smarter.

94
00:06:06,645 --> 00:06:12,195
It puts itself in, put super position
and explore all paths simultaneously.

95
00:06:13,185 --> 00:06:18,705
Quantum State explore Path one and
Path two and part three and so on

96
00:06:19,395 --> 00:06:24,855
at the same time in parallel, then
it collab collapse to the solution.

97
00:06:25,355 --> 00:06:26,915
For certain type of problems.

98
00:06:27,335 --> 00:06:32,255
This give you exponential speed up
problem that would take classical computer

99
00:06:32,255 --> 00:06:35,015
Millions of years can be solved in hours.

100
00:06:36,005 --> 00:06:40,325
But here's the catch, and this is
where our billing nightmares begin.

101
00:06:41,075 --> 00:06:42,785
Quantum computers are fragile.

102
00:06:43,285 --> 00:06:49,495
Before we get to the fragility problem,
let me explain one more quantum concept.

103
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:53,515
That make everything even more
powerful and more unpredictable,

104
00:06:53,905 --> 00:06:55,915
that is quantum entanglement.

105
00:06:56,415 --> 00:07:00,915
When two qubits become entangled,
they become connected in a way

106
00:07:01,305 --> 00:07:04,215
that defies every day experiences.

107
00:07:04,845 --> 00:07:09,885
If you measure one qubit and find
it zero and other, qubit instantly

108
00:07:10,245 --> 00:07:14,975
become one, even if they are
opposite side of the galaxy and.

109
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:21,745
This select quantum computers coordinate
multiple calculations in way that would

110
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:24,145
be impossible with classical computers.

111
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:30,115
It's like having a team of workers
who can telepathically communicate

112
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:32,155
and coordinate their accent perfectly.

113
00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:38,340
So now let me show you what a
Quantum Cloud bill actually look like

114
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,085
because this is already happening.

115
00:07:41,955 --> 00:07:42,165
Here.

116
00:07:42,165 --> 00:07:46,455
You can see in this slide a real
example of what you might see.

117
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:54,405
As you can see, it is too messy and
can't understand too easily, so your

118
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,015
algorithm work perfect for perfectly.

119
00:07:57,645 --> 00:08:01,875
It solved your problem, but the universe
decide to be expensive that day.

120
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:09,430
This is why current Quantum Service,
quantum Cloud Services from IBM.

121
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:15,060
Google, Amazon and Microsoft are
struggling with pricing model.

122
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,910
They're trying to meter the UNM and
unpredic the unpredictable, predictable

123
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,710
insult classic cloud bill, like known
CP, known memory, known storage,

124
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,435
which is leads to predictable cost.

125
00:08:30,935 --> 00:08:37,505
But whereas you can see compute, quantum
cloud bill, billing, like unknown

126
00:08:37,505 --> 00:08:43,055
time, unknown errors, unknown Ries,
and don't know about a cost at the end.

127
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:49,105
So this is where the story get
interesting because there is a company

128
00:08:49,105 --> 00:08:55,165
that looked at this whole mess and said,
what if we just don't meet cumulus?

129
00:08:55,765 --> 00:09:00,325
Instead of trying to measure every quantum
operations and charge you for ease things,

130
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,785
they took completely different approach.

131
00:09:03,595 --> 00:09:07,425
As you can see in this slide, there
is a comparison between traditional

132
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:09,585
cloud approach and a seamless approach.

133
00:09:10,395 --> 00:09:16,335
As you can see, traditional approach,
which is step one, measure everything

134
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:21,885
and then complex calculations, and
that at the end surprises bill.

135
00:09:22,385 --> 00:09:26,455
Whereas the seamless approach,
there is a pretty defined fixed

136
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:32,825
resources, fixed prices, and then
you will sleep well at night.

137
00:09:33,605 --> 00:09:38,405
So Cumulus believes in providing
high performing fixed cost computing

138
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:42,365
power instead of selling every single
service and metering the users.

139
00:09:42,865 --> 00:09:47,125
You can get started with S Cloud
platform for less than just.

140
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,995
Less than just a hundred dollars
monthly, no upfront cost, no long-term

141
00:09:53,055 --> 00:09:55,155
commitments and no surprise bills.

142
00:09:55,635 --> 00:09:59,805
It's just like Netflix for cloud
computing and you pay for monthly fee.

143
00:10:00,285 --> 00:10:03,555
You get access to the platform
and you can use it without

144
00:10:03,555 --> 00:10:04,845
borrow about the meter running.

145
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:08,535
You can get started with Ulus
Cloud platform for less than

146
00:10:08,535 --> 00:10:10,245
just a hundred dollar monthly.

147
00:10:10,755 --> 00:10:15,135
No upfront cost, no long-term
commitments, no surprise bills.

148
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:21,330
Just like Netflix for cloud computing,
you pay for monthly fee and you get the

149
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:26,700
access to the platform and you can use it
without worrying about the meter running.

150
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,700
Now let me explain why this
approach is brilliant for quantum

151
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:38,410
computing because ulus is built on
open stack, which is open source.

152
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:44,155
This means no vendor lock in, and you are
not trapped in anyone's quantum ecosystem.

153
00:10:44,655 --> 00:10:47,805
Let me share a real example
of why this matters.

154
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:53,355
I talked to a startup that
moved from AWS to Ulus here.

155
00:10:53,355 --> 00:10:58,125
What changed before AWS
monthly will somewhere between

156
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,815
eight $800 to the $4,000.

157
00:11:02,315 --> 00:11:08,025
The time is spent off on cost
optimization is 20 20% of engineering

158
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:11,385
time and you can see sleep quality.

159
00:11:11,385 --> 00:11:17,475
Ability to experiment is in the
limit and innovation rate is slow.

160
00:11:18,015 --> 00:11:23,715
And on the other end you can see
at q plus monthly bill is now too

161
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:28,935
low, too less, and time is spent
on cost optimization is zero.

162
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:34,895
You can see sleep quality, actually
good, and ability to experiment

163
00:11:34,955 --> 00:11:36,905
unlimited within the resources.

164
00:11:37,475 --> 00:11:43,595
And other last one is innovation date,
which is three x faster than the AWS.

165
00:11:44,095 --> 00:11:47,905
So the founder told me something
that I'll never forget.

166
00:11:48,505 --> 00:11:51,535
The best fight is not
even the cost saving.

167
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,050
It being able to actually build
things instead of consistently

168
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,000
optimizing for AWS pricing.

169
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,080
When quantum computing become
mainstream, this difference

170
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,700
will be even more dramatic.

171
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,880
Company using traditional paper quantum
operations model is will spend more

172
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,070
time on time optimizing for cost,
then optimizing for the result.

173
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:20,305
Company which is using fixed due pricing
model will be free to experiment,

174
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,675
innovate, and actually solves problem.

175
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:27,435
Look, quantum computing is going
to reconstruct how we solve

176
00:12:27,435 --> 00:12:31,635
problems, but it doesn't, hand
doesn't have to be transformed

177
00:12:31,995 --> 00:12:33,760
your budget in the wrong direction.

178
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,820
The future belongs to the platform that
understand quantum unpredictability

179
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,850
and abstract it away from developers.

180
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,390
So fixed pricing.

181
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,860
It is not just better cloud
economics, it's the foundation that

182
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:53,540
make quantum innovation possible
without quantum sized financial risk.

183
00:12:54,170 --> 00:13:00,170
So you can check ulus on the ulus.io
and see what transparent and fixed

184
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,630
pricing actually means in practice.

185
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:09,430
So the future is quantum and your cloud
bill doesn't have to be quantum chaotic.

186
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,140
So thank you everyone.

187
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:17,020
As this is a prerecorded talk, you
can ask me any questions or anything

188
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,500
related to tech or cloud, anything.

189
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,910
I'm happy to answer any questions
you might have just ping me

190
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,620
up on the LinkedIn or tutor.

191
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,740
And these are my handles you
can see in this light, so

192
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,300
you can follow me also there.

193
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,370
So thank you everyone.

194
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:35,880
Bye bye.
