1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,229
Welcome everyone.

2
00:00:01,729 --> 00:00:08,029
My name is Olanrewaju Edele and today
I will be diving into how AI powered

3
00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:13,269
personalization is revolutionized,
revolutionizing users experience.

4
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:16,879
A quick look at the outline for today.

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:22,750
We will look at why personalization
matters, evolution of personalization

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:28,040
techniques, how AI enhances user
experience and a few other topics.

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,600
Let's jump into it.

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,990
To start, let's define what
we mean by AI personalization.

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:41,950
AI personalization essentially is
the use of machine learning and

10
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:47,979
predictive analytics to understand
and anticipate users preferences.

11
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,059
By processing vast amounts of user
data, things like browsing updates.

12
00:00:53,994 --> 00:00:58,164
previous purchases, and even
interactions across different devices.

13
00:00:58,664 --> 00:01:03,224
AI can predict what the user
might want to see or do next.

14
00:01:03,724 --> 00:01:08,504
What's powerful here is that AI
allows brands to create truly

15
00:01:08,534 --> 00:01:10,594
individualized experiences.

16
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:15,549
Instead of generic recommendations,
we are talking about personalized

17
00:01:15,589 --> 00:01:21,469
content, specific product suggestions,
or even dynamic interfaces that are

18
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:24,299
just based on each user's preferences.

19
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,959
And this isn't just about making
the experience convenient.

20
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:31,949
It's also about creating
a genuine connection.

21
00:01:32,449 --> 00:01:37,699
Uses feel seen and valued when
interactions feels unique to them,

22
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:41,609
which in turn builds trust and loyalty.

23
00:01:42,309 --> 00:01:48,769
So by meeting people's exactly where
they are, AI powered personalization

24
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:54,349
is not just enhancing engagement,
it's strengthening relationships and

25
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:58,029
throughout this presentation, we will
explore how this technology works.

26
00:01:58,604 --> 00:02:02,464
The benefit it brings and how
it can be leveraged to craft

27
00:02:02,464 --> 00:02:04,444
meaningful user experiences.

28
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:08,964
now that we have introduced
what AI personalization is,

29
00:02:09,404 --> 00:02:11,274
let's look at why it matters.

30
00:02:11,774 --> 00:02:17,454
Studies have shown that personalization is
a significant driver of users engagement.

31
00:02:18,214 --> 00:02:24,369
And according to McKinsey's 2023 reports,
personalization Implementing tailored

32
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:31,609
experiences can lead to a remarkable 50
percent increase in users interaction and

33
00:02:31,649 --> 00:02:34,859
a 200 percent boost in conversion rates.

34
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:41,229
That's a clear indication that when we
meet users with content or recommendations

35
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:45,909
that resonates with them, they are far
more likely to engage meaningfully.

36
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:49,484
Personalization does more than
driving short term engagement.

37
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,594
It also fosters long term loyalty.

38
00:02:53,264 --> 00:03:00,324
For example, I switched to Spotify from
another music app due to how highly

39
00:03:00,324 --> 00:03:02,954
relatable the mix I get on Spotify is.

40
00:03:03,564 --> 00:03:09,634
it's so personalized that I get
to listen to the songs that I

41
00:03:09,634 --> 00:03:11,744
will ideally want to listen to.

42
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,894
And I'm going to be honest.

43
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,364
I've switched for more
than three years now.

44
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:22,904
By addressing users unique needs
and preferences, brands can create

45
00:03:22,974 --> 00:03:26,184
connections that make users feel valued.

46
00:03:26,734 --> 00:03:32,144
In fact, users are 60 percent more likely
to return to a brand when they feel

47
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:34,154
their interactions are personalized.

48
00:03:34,654 --> 00:03:39,684
What we see here is that
personalization isn't just a trend.

49
00:03:40,184 --> 00:03:45,724
It's a powerful tool for building
both engagement and loyalty.

50
00:03:46,224 --> 00:03:50,584
To understand the impact of AI
in personalization, let's take a

51
00:03:50,584 --> 00:03:54,534
deeper look at how personalization
techniques have evolved over time.

52
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:58,664
In the past, personalization
was relatively static.

53
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:04,639
Brands segmented their audience into
broad groups based on demographic

54
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:07,169
data or previous interactions.

55
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:13,729
For example, they might target all 20
to 30 year olds with similar interests

56
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:18,409
or they'd rely on a user's purchase
history to suggest similar items.

57
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:24,149
While this can be effective to a
degree, this approach didn't fully

58
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:27,049
account for individuality of each user.

59
00:04:27,549 --> 00:04:32,879
Now, what we are seeing is that AI has
transformed this approach entirely.

60
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:39,379
Today, personalization can happen in
real time, adapting to each user's

61
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:44,509
current behavior, preferences, and
even to the context of their actions.

62
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:49,829
With machine learning algorithms,
we can create dynamic user profiles

63
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:56,139
that continuously update Allowing
experiences to shift as the

64
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:57,729
user interacts with the brand.

65
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:04,149
This shift from the static to
adaptive personalization means

66
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:11,719
that brands can provide experiences
that feel more relevant, up to

67
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:13,499
date and genuinely tailored.

68
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:17,919
And as users, preferences
evolve over time.

69
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:25,029
The personalization evolves with them,
creating a more connected and engaging

70
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:28,069
experience at every touch point.

71
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:34,789
Now, let's explore how AI can
fundamentally enhance the user experience.

72
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:42,269
One of AI's most powerful benefits
is its ability to uncover insights

73
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,919
into user behaviors that would be
impossible to detect otherwise.

74
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:51,949
Through machine learning, we can
analyze vast amount of engagement data,

75
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:58,819
identifying patterns and preferences
that help shape each user's experience.

76
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:05,429
For instance, based on a user's browsing
history, previous interaction, or even

77
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,499
the time of the day they are active,
AI can suggest highly relevant content,

78
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:13,639
services, or product tailored to them.

79
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:18,189
This doesn't just improve engagement,
it also makes the user journey

80
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:19,979
smoother and more intuitive.

81
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,439
Instead of users searching for what
they need, the system proactively

82
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:27,189
delivers options that feels just right.

83
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:32,079
It's as if the platform can
anticipate their next step, reducing

84
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:37,499
any friction in the experience and
making interactions feel seamless.

85
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:38,759
Automating.

86
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:45,489
AI's capability to analyze, predict,
and recommend creates a journey where

87
00:06:45,609 --> 00:06:50,279
each touchpoint feels thoughtfully
designed for that specific user.

88
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:55,779
This level of personalization not
only improves satisfaction, but

89
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:58,995
also increases the likelihood of
users returning, strengthening

90
00:06:58,995 --> 00:07:01,821
their connection with the brand.

91
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:06,909
Now, let's dive into some of the key AI

92
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:07,599
models.

93
00:07:07,904 --> 00:07:10,794
And I'll go with names that
make personalization possible.

94
00:07:11,294 --> 00:07:15,984
AI powered personalization relies on
several core machine learning models.

95
00:07:16,484 --> 00:07:19,364
Two of the most commonly
used are collaborative

96
00:07:19,384 --> 00:07:21,944
filtering and neural networks.

97
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:24,974
Let's look at what
collaborative filtering means.

98
00:07:25,614 --> 00:07:30,254
Collaborative filtering is a powerful
method that suggests content or products

99
00:07:30,304 --> 00:07:33,074
based on similarities across user data.

100
00:07:33,914 --> 00:07:34,694
For example.

101
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,019
If two users have interacted
with similar content in the past,

102
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:43,589
the system might recommend items
that one has liked to the other.

103
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:49,929
This technique leverages both individual
and collective behaviors to make informed

104
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:56,209
decisions, even if a user's direct
activity on that content is limited.

105
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,079
Now, a look at neural networks.

106
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:06,079
Neural networks on the other hand can
process large complex data sets to

107
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,379
find hidden patterns in user behavior.

108
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:15,769
They can analyze a wide variety of
inputs such as clicks, dwell time, and

109
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:19,749
purchase pattern to build a nuanced
profile of each user's preferences.

110
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:24,789
With this insight, neural networks
are particularly effective at

111
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:31,669
predicting what might engage users
in a dynamic and highly accurate way.

112
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:36,319
This algorithm works together to
create a seamless experience for the

113
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:41,339
user by predicting their needs and
offering tailored recommendations.

114
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,239
AI models help users discover
relevant content with minimal

115
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:53,589
effort, making each interaction
more engaging and personalized.

116
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:55,679
Data collection and processing.

117
00:08:56,179 --> 00:09:02,969
Personalization powered by AI depends
solely on gathering, And processing a

118
00:09:02,969 --> 00:09:07,569
wide range of data, and it's essential
to do this ethically and responsibly.

119
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:16,309
AI driven personalization uses data from
various sources, such as web interaction,

120
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:22,609
app usage, purchase history, to
understand users preference and behaviors.

121
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:26,969
This diversity of data enables
us to build a richer, more

122
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,059
accurate profile for our users.

123
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:34,709
Of each user, allowing for a more
tailored and relevant recommendation.

124
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:39,609
However, with this level
of data collection, privacy

125
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:41,579
and ethics are paramount.

126
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:46,409
All data is collected and processed
in compliance with regulatory

127
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:51,719
standards, like the GDPR, which
enforces strict guidelines on how

128
00:09:51,749 --> 00:09:54,389
companies handle personal information.

129
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:59,699
By adhering to these standards, we
ensure that users privacy is protected

130
00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:03,389
and their data is used responsibly.

131
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:07,439
Real time processing is
another crucial aspect.

132
00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:13,029
By analyzing data in real time,
we can provide timely, relevant

133
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:18,099
recommendations that keep up with
users current needs and behaviors.

134
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:24,494
Ultimately, we Ethical data adding
not only enhances user's experience,

135
00:10:24,884 --> 00:10:31,104
but also builds trust, assuring users
that your privacy is valued while

136
00:10:31,104 --> 00:10:34,004
delivering a personalized experience.

137
00:10:34,504 --> 00:10:41,914
Now, let's discuss the importance of
real time personalization at scale.

138
00:10:42,414 --> 00:10:46,514
Scalability is crucial when it
comes to delivering personalized

139
00:10:46,514 --> 00:10:50,544
experience, especially for
companies with millions of users.

140
00:10:51,294 --> 00:10:57,064
Organizations like Netflix and Spotify
exemplify this with their advanced

141
00:10:57,064 --> 00:11:00,474
AI powered recommendation engines.

142
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:06,054
These platforms effectively personalize
content for their vast users by

143
00:11:06,114 --> 00:11:09,134
continuously analyzing real time data.

144
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:14,214
By leveraging machine learning algorithm,
they can adapt recommendations as users

145
00:11:14,244 --> 00:11:19,984
preferences evolve, ensuring that every
interaction feels fresh and relevant.

146
00:11:20,944 --> 00:11:27,224
For example, if a user suddenly starts
exploring a new genre of music or shows

147
00:11:27,224 --> 00:11:32,794
interest in different types of movies,
this platform can quickly adjust their

148
00:11:32,794 --> 00:11:35,484
recommendations to align with the shift.

149
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,539
Keeping users engaged and satisfied.

150
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,599
This capability not only enhances
users experience, but it also

151
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:45,439
increases retention rates.

152
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:49,989
When users receive recommendations that
resonate with their changing tastes,

153
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:56,119
they are more likely to spend time on the
platform and discover even newer content.

154
00:11:56,619 --> 00:11:59,799
In summary, real time
personalization at scale.

155
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:07,469
Allows business to meet users where they
are, ensuring that each individual feels

156
00:12:07,469 --> 00:12:11,729
recognized valued, regardless of our lack.

157
00:12:11,729 --> 00:12:12,869
The user base may be

158
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:18,169
well, AI driven personalization
of a significant benefits.

159
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:23,269
It also comes with his own set of
challenges that we must address.

160
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:25,499
One of the primary concern.

161
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:27,859
is data privacy.

162
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:34,149
As we collect and analyze vast amount
of user data, we must ensure that this

163
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:40,219
is done ethically and in compliance
with regulatory frameworks like the

164
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:44,759
GDPR in Europe and CCPA in California.

165
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:50,069
These regulations dictate how
companies can use personal information

166
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:52,589
and failure to adhere to them.

167
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:55,999
Can lead to severe penalties
and damage to trust.

168
00:12:56,499 --> 00:13:00,819
Ethical concerns also arise from
the way AI algorithms are designed.

169
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:08,079

339
00:26:11,894 --> 00:26:14,524
and stronger customer relationship.

340
00:26:15,024 --> 00:26:18,484
As we wrap up this presentation,
let's highlight the key takeaways.

341
00:26:19,224 --> 00:26:22,674
We've explored how AI powered
personalization can significantly

342
00:26:22,704 --> 00:26:27,494
transform the user's experience by making
interaction more relevant and engaging.

343
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:34,149
By leveraging AI, businesses can tailor
their offerings to meet individual user

344
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:40,999
preferences, ultimately fostering deeper
connection and enhancing satisfaction.

345
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:45,189
However, with great power
comes great responsibility.

346
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:51,239
We emphasize that ethical practices and
transparencies are paramount in building

347
00:26:51,239 --> 00:26:54,139
a trustworthy personalization strategy.

348
00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:54,209
Thank you.

349
00:26:55,184 --> 00:27:01,884
Users need to feel confident that
their data is handled responsibly

350
00:27:02,264 --> 00:27:04,334
and that their privacy is respected.

351
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:08,854
This trust is essential for long
term engagement and loyalty.

352
00:27:09,354 --> 00:27:11,534
Adaptability is another crucial factor.

353
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:16,244
As user preferences shift,
your personalization strategy

354
00:27:16,254 --> 00:27:18,384
must evolve accordingly.

355
00:27:19,254 --> 00:27:23,254
Continuous refinement of algorithms
and regular assessments of user

356
00:27:23,254 --> 00:27:28,044
feedback will ensure that your approach
remains relevant and effective.

357
00:27:28,544 --> 00:27:33,034
With these principles in mind, you
can create a robust personalization

358
00:27:33,034 --> 00:27:38,434
strategy that not only delivers
value to your users, but also

359
00:27:39,104 --> 00:27:40,904
cultivates their trust in your brands.

360
00:27:41,404 --> 00:27:46,704
Thank you for everyone for
attending and if you have any

361
00:27:46,704 --> 00:27:48,754
questions, please let me know.

362
00:27:49,214 --> 00:27:50,137
Thank you all.
