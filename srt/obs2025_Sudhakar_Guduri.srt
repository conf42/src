1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:00,740
Hey.

2
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:00,920
Hi.

3
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:07,055
This is, I like process of experience
into the data housing such as SSIS

4
00:00:07,055 --> 00:00:12,055
tool Informatica Under, and also
having experience in the reporting

5
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:15,505
tools such as SRS Pyramid reporting.

6
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:20,425
Today I'm going to be, discuss our, the
serverless revolution, how the cloud-based

7
00:00:20,425 --> 00:00:23,455
shared data integration is transforming
the enterprise data management.

8
00:00:24,415 --> 00:00:28,315
Cloud-based data integration has image
as a transformative force in enterprise

9
00:00:28,315 --> 00:00:32,665
data management revolutionized how our
nation handles the exceptional growth

10
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:35,815
of our data across the separate sources.

11
00:00:35,815 --> 00:00:40,945
With a global data creation projected
to reach 1 75 gtz by 2025, companies

12
00:00:40,945 --> 00:00:44,815
now struggle with integrating data from
an average of full disparate sources.

13
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,570
Organization implementing cloud
integration solutions reported

14
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,620
30 to 40% direction in the total
cost of ownership and up to 60%.

15
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:53,800
Four.

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,430
So inside competitor traditional
methods, unlike convention on

17
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,880
the six solutions, requiring
eight to 12 months of deployment.

18
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:06,340
Cloud integration for deployment times,
averaging just six to eight weeks while

19
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,245
providing significant uptime improvements.

20
00:01:08,745 --> 00:01:09,885
Let me go to the slide.

21
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:13,335
So the paradigm shift in enterprise
data management, we have a

22
00:01:13,335 --> 00:01:14,865
traditional integration on the cloud.

23
00:01:14,865 --> 00:01:19,645
Integrations on-prem solutions dominated
80 by 88% of the entire enterprise

24
00:01:19,645 --> 00:01:23,965
integration market in 2010 declining
to the approximately that 5% by 2022.

25
00:01:24,465 --> 00:01:28,245
The systems present a significant
limitations with over 70% of organization

26
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:32,365
reporting scalability, constraints and
integration phase during the peak periods.

27
00:01:32,775 --> 00:01:35,835
And coming to the cloud integration, if
you see here, like the cloud platform

28
00:01:35,835 --> 00:01:41,175
supported workload variations of 2200,
300% with the without a performance

29
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:45,285
integration, organizations nowadays,
organizations are opting cloud integration

30
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:49,965
reports 70% direction in their primary
times, and 85% decrease in net related

31
00:01:49,965 --> 00:01:54,475
incidents with the subsequent growth
projected and when coming to the cost

32
00:01:54,475 --> 00:01:57,805
benefits of the cloud integration, if we
see here on the chart, like we have the

33
00:01:57,805 --> 00:01:59,935
cost category on traditional integrations.

34
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,030
And the cloud integration
on the directions.

35
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,679
If you see the the interest
cost, traditional integrations

36
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:06,580
is a hundred percent.

37
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,195
And when it comes to the cloud
integration, it's 55.6 50 to 65,

38
00:02:11,649 --> 00:02:14,519
and reduction is 35 point 35 to 45.

39
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:18,839
And coming to the maintenance in the
duration integration, it's 20 to 25.

40
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:23,519
And the cloud integration, it's
some to 10 and reductions is 62, 65.

41
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:27,359
When come into the development
that in duration integration,

42
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:28,349
it's a hundred percent.

43
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:32,219
Cloud integration for 2
2 16 and ion is 40 to 50.

44
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:35,325
And total cost of the ownership
it's traditional is a hundred,

45
00:02:35,624 --> 00:02:39,339
and the cloud integration is 60
to 70, and election is 30 to 40.

46
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:41,959
Come, let's move to the initial slide.

47
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,290
So if you see here this this
are the evolution of the data

48
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,309
integration technologies.

49
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:49,089
So the first one is the
traditional ETL error.

50
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:54,124
So manually will process request an
average of 40 percent of 40 develop

51
00:02:54,124 --> 00:02:56,734
per hours for integration on premises.

52
00:02:56,734 --> 00:03:00,664
Solution dominated 80% on
integration market in 2010.

53
00:03:01,444 --> 00:03:03,994
So when coming to the second
point, it's a transition period.

54
00:03:04,774 --> 00:03:07,204
And the third point is the
cloud native integration.

55
00:03:07,474 --> 00:03:11,504
And the fourth one is the feature
productions like back 1 25 or 80%

56
00:03:11,504 --> 00:03:13,934
of the operation will add up to the
clause based integration platform

57
00:03:14,474 --> 00:03:15,974
as a primary integration strategy.

58
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:18,629
Okay, so let me show the chart here.

59
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:21,959
If you look into the chart
here, the enterprise application

60
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,069
education market growth.

61
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:28,379
So if you look at like 2022, it's
25% and like 2024, it's like more

62
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:33,384
than near two 35% down 20, 26, et
cetera have grown to around 40%.

63
00:03:33,384 --> 00:03:37,974
Year two and 2028, it's going
to be between 50% and 2030.

64
00:03:38,214 --> 00:03:40,914
Expectations is like around
like more than 65 plus.

65
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:43,039
So let's move to the next slide.

66
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,999
Like if, here in the next slide we have
the leading cloud integration platforms.

67
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:52,189
So we have a different cloud integration
platforms such as a WS Q and the

68
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:57,139
Microsoft Azure Data Factory and the
Google Cloud data of a data flow.

69
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,559
This platform collectively control
over 70% of authentication platforms.

70
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:03,849
Are they continuity, evolving rapidly
with the numerous features releasing,

71
00:04:04,089 --> 00:04:05,499
including emission learning based data.

72
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:08,529
Quality monitoring on the
automated all edge tracking.

73
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:11,529
So let me move on to the next steps slide.

74
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:14,260
So if you move to the next
slide, like here, like we have

75
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,990
the customer satisfaction with
the cloud integration platforms.

76
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:23,090
It see the a Ws view like it's 4.5 or
the five on the other data factories 4.3

77
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:27,000
and the Google cloud data flow is 4.4.

78
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,360
So let me move on to the next slide.

79
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,690
So if you come to the next slide, like
here we have several less architectures.

80
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:37,770
The new para, if you see the diagram
we have a automatics scaling.

81
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:42,330
So which hand the launch volume
regions and within the second cost

82
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,840
optimization development focus management.

83
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,920
And let me move on to the next slide.

84
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,860
If you see here, like we do have like
even driven integration benefits.

85
00:04:51,455 --> 00:04:55,275
If you see here even reduction means
triggers based on the data changes or

86
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:57,345
schedule events on the automated process.

87
00:04:57,395 --> 00:05:00,995
Authentication workflows without the
manual intervention and coming to

88
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:02,855
the real time analytics enables data.

89
00:05:03,015 --> 00:05:04,575
Yeah, insights from the process.

90
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:09,045
Data and data ion upgrades flow through
the head pipeline within the minutes.

91
00:05:09,255 --> 00:05:10,755
Let me move on to the next slide.

92
00:05:11,265 --> 00:05:14,145
So if you see here, like in the
slide, like we have the financial

93
00:05:14,145 --> 00:05:15,465
services sector implementations.

94
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:17,995
What are the integration
challenges on the cloud solution?

95
00:05:17,995 --> 00:05:20,185
Challenges on them results achieved.

96
00:05:20,935 --> 00:05:23,544
So this case demonstrates
the transformation potential

97
00:05:23,544 --> 00:05:26,465
of cloud integration in a
highly regulated environments.

98
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,555
The majority of the financial
institutions implementing similar

99
00:05:29,555 --> 00:05:33,090
solutions report enhanced analytical
capabilities with the dramatically

100
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,604
link decreased time to insight compared
to the previous premises systems.

101
00:05:37,064 --> 00:05:39,134
If you see, if you go to
the next slide, like we have

102
00:05:39,134 --> 00:05:40,694
healthcare sector implementations.

103
00:05:41,369 --> 00:05:44,254
So the initial integration challenges
for the healthcare ethical sector and

104
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:47,949
the cloud integration approach, what they
follow and what are the transformation

105
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:53,159
achieve in this particular healthcare
sector on the ongoing benefits.

106
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,269
As a Highland reports, more than 80%
of healthcare products are implemented,

107
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:01,559
some type of the cloud service, such as
applications, infrastructure, or deferred

108
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:04,509
from services enabling sustainable
improvements in both operational

109
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:05,794
efficiency and quality of care.

110
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,870
Let me move on to the next slide.

111
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,200
We do have the manufacturing
sector implementations, I water

112
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,400
data collections and cloud
integration, predictive analytics,

113
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,050
and the operational improvements.

114
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,410
So like the multinational manufacturing
corporate implemented cloud based

115
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,290
integrations to transform their
operations through comprehensive

116
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,520
data collection analysis.

117
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,980
Let me move to the next slide.

118
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,825
We have the implementation success
factors, like the first one is

119
00:06:29,845 --> 00:06:32,025
the phase migration approach.

120
00:06:32,985 --> 00:06:36,465
And the second one is the hybrid
architecture during the transitions.

121
00:06:36,585 --> 00:06:40,125
And the third one is the designed
data governance and the executive

122
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:44,205
sponsorship and the common success
pattern emerge from the cloud.

123
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:48,285
Integration across industries,
organizations that follow the

124
00:06:48,285 --> 00:06:51,335
best practice of consistently
achieve better outcomes with the

125
00:06:51,335 --> 00:06:51,936
fewer implementation challenges.

126
00:06:51,936 --> 00:06:54,035
Let me move on to the next slide.

127
00:06:54,035 --> 00:06:56,285
Like the feature of the
enterprise data management.

128
00:06:56,525 --> 00:07:00,155
So if you see here, like AI integration,
machine learning algorithms, which

129
00:07:00,155 --> 00:07:03,395
increase the automated data mapping
transformations and the quality

130
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:06,755
management reducing manual effort
while improve the accuracy and

131
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,855
duty change the data structures.

132
00:07:08,855 --> 00:07:11,285
N let me move on to the next slide.

133
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:12,475
Multi-cloud integrations.

134
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:17,120
Organizations will increasingly
adopt to the integration statuses

135
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,070
that span multiple cloud products.

136
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,230
Last one is the real time, everything.

137
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,590
The ship, they the ship toward
the real time data process and

138
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,880
will accelerate for the batch.

139
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,660
Interesting approaches increasing,
replaced by the streaming architectures

140
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,650
that enables ate insights and
action based on current data.

141
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,240
To conclude like the cloud-based
data integrations represents a

142
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,770
fundamental transformation in.

143
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:43,680
How enterprise managers process and
the value of from their data assets.

144
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:47,760
As this technology continue to evolve,
they will increasingly become the

145
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,300
foundation upon the nation, build
their data strategies, enabling them

146
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,540
to harness the full potential of
their information as increasingly

147
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,010
data driven business landscape.

148
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,805
That's all about it.

149
00:07:57,904 --> 00:08:00,889
If you have questions you can
ping me in the LinkedIn or

150
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:02,209
