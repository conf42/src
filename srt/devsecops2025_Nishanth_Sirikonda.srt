1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:02,940
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,990
Uh, this is Nhan nda, senior I
three B, member and, uh, cloud

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,400
architect to be talking about the
building unbreakable systems, the

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,300
risk driven DevSecOps and actions.

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,910
So the practical, the best practices.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,650
Securing a distributed system is
complex, but true resilience comes from.

7
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:26,115
Robust practices, not just tools.

8
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:26,834
Alright.

9
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:30,465
The evolving challenges of
modern enterprise systems.

10
00:00:30,915 --> 00:00:35,175
You know, the dynamic,
interconnected, and rapidly evolving.

11
00:00:35,805 --> 00:00:38,864
Whereas coming to the complex systems,
you know, the modern enterprise

12
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:43,394
systems are complex way above the
cloud infrastructure like, you know,

13
00:00:43,394 --> 00:00:46,965
SaaS, APIs and third party integration.

14
00:00:47,025 --> 00:00:49,695
The forming a, the vast digital fabric.

15
00:00:50,415 --> 00:00:53,325
Hidden vulnerabilities like you
know, vulnerabilities, luck and

16
00:00:54,285 --> 00:01:00,015
misconfigurations, identity sprawl
and supply chain weakness, often

17
00:01:00,015 --> 00:01:02,175
unseen by traditional security.

18
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:03,885
The proactive resilience.

19
00:01:03,885 --> 00:01:09,190
You know, the true resilience requires
shifting from a reactive firefighting to

20
00:01:09,675 --> 00:01:12,585
proactive foresightful security assurance.

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,530
Right.

22
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,190
Why traditional devs SEC
apps is not enough, right?

23
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,679
Limited scope, the pipeline focus.

24
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,289
DevSecOps leaves the critical grabs,
you know, across SaaS platforms,

25
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:31,110
identity and access management
and integration layer that exist

26
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,289
outside traditional ci cd workflows.

27
00:01:34,815 --> 00:01:39,735
Reactive push security becomes a
downstream checkpoint focused on

28
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:46,365
scanning and gating releases rather
than an upstream design principle that

29
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:48,789
prevents issue before they manifest.

30
00:01:49,935 --> 00:01:56,055
Scattered dispute without centralized
risk visibility, organization struggles

31
00:01:56,055 --> 00:02:02,085
to prioritize, uh, remediation efforts
or understand the true security

32
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:04,905
posture across distributed systems.

33
00:02:05,505 --> 00:02:11,985
We must expand dev apps behind
infrastructure and pipelines to

34
00:02:12,135 --> 00:02:17,590
encompass the full ecosystem, the
shift to risk driven dev apps.

35
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,609
The first thing, identify critical assets.

36
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:23,700
You know, understand the
key business value and the

37
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,410
potential impact of the failure.

38
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:29,730
The second, prioritize by impact,
you know, allocate security

39
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,940
resources based on business impact.

40
00:02:33,795 --> 00:02:35,204
Anchor decision and risk.

41
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:41,505
Use risk to guide engineering
priorities, automation and architecture.

42
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:44,565
You know, the risk driven dev sec apps.

43
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:51,105
The build Reside by focusing efforts on
protecting critical systems and data.

44
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,734
Seeing the wild risk landscape.

45
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:57,524
Map the ecosystem, not just the pipeline.

46
00:02:57,584 --> 00:03:02,595
Okay, the cloud misconfiguration
storage buckets, network rules.

47
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,260
Encryption settings and
resource permissions across

48
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,060
multi-cloud environments.

49
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,299
Such third party risk, external
integrations, you know, a PA connections,

50
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:21,990
the vendor access and data sharing
relationships, identity surfaces, user

51
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,740
permissions, service accounts, or the
grants and privilege escalation parts.

52
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,190
The data flows, cross system dependencies.

53
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,020
The data movement patterns
and integrations, touch point,

54
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:42,210
comprehensive visibility across
your entire technology ecosystem

55
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,610
is the foundation of the residence.

56
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,925
You cannot protect what you cannot see.

57
00:03:49,025 --> 00:03:53,215
Continuous monitoring complaints
as a practice detect issues

58
00:03:53,515 --> 00:03:54,855
before they become incidents.

59
00:03:55,515 --> 00:03:55,785
Right.

60
00:03:55,785 --> 00:04:01,095
Rule number one, establish baselines,
define guardrails for common

61
00:04:01,095 --> 00:04:07,485
failure points across cloud SaaS
identity and a PA configurations.

62
00:04:07,785 --> 00:04:10,905
The next thing, continuency
policy checks audit.

63
00:04:10,965 --> 00:04:16,730
Automated validation runs constantly
catching a drift and violations

64
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:22,370
in real time rather than during
periodic audits, always on feedback.

65
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:29,909
Treat compliance as continuous feedback
mechanism that informs engineering

66
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:32,669
decisions and improve system design.

67
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:33,659
Okay.

68
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:33,870
Alright.

69
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,799
What's the key insight?

70
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:40,890
The monitoring is not about deploying
more tools, it's about establishing

71
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:46,380
disciplined continuous validations
as a core operational practice.

72
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,939
I'm reading Zalen in CICD development.

73
00:04:51,735 --> 00:04:55,125
The build systems that
can bend without breaking.

74
00:04:56,205 --> 00:04:57,735
Automate early checks.

75
00:04:57,765 --> 00:04:58,035
Okay.

76
00:04:58,275 --> 00:05:03,560
Integrate security validations
directly into development workflows to

77
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,360
proactively identify and fix issues.

78
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,280
Dependency hygiene.

79
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,920
Ensure supply chain integrity,
buy consistently auditing and

80
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,400
updating all third party components.

81
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,200
Strengthen extension.

82
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:25,680
Fortify the custom scripts and integration
points with strict security standards

83
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,650
to eliminate common vulnerabilities.

84
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,300
You know, the pipelines became
resilience engines when practices

85
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:39,150
enforce consistency and predictability
across every deployment.

86
00:05:41,294 --> 00:05:46,664
Access governance and audit as
a risk controls, reduce exposure

87
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:50,265
through good operational hygiene hub.

88
00:05:50,354 --> 00:05:54,255
The role-based access
control design, RBAC.

89
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:58,304
Roles that map to a real job.

90
00:05:58,304 --> 00:06:01,364
Responsibilities, not generic templates.

91
00:06:02,505 --> 00:06:03,734
Regular reviews.

92
00:06:04,005 --> 00:06:07,245
Ensure permissions remind
aligned permissions.

93
00:06:07,995 --> 00:06:13,545
With current duties and follow least
privileged principles, conditional

94
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:19,605
access standards, implement contextual
access policies as a default

95
00:06:19,965 --> 00:06:26,205
considering device health, location,
risk signals, and user behavior,

96
00:06:26,775 --> 00:06:28,845
not as a special case exceptions.

97
00:06:30,075 --> 00:06:31,515
Reliable audit trials?

98
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:31,934
Yes.

99
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:39,104
Maintaining comprehensive tamper evidence
logs that support both accountability.

100
00:06:39,164 --> 00:06:40,905
Organizational learning.

101
00:06:41,955 --> 00:06:46,815
Audit data becomes a strategic asset
for improving security portion.

102
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:53,054
Governance and identity disciplines are
quite superpowers and resilient systems.

103
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:57,099
Alright, but essential foundations
for security as a scale.

104
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:04,740
Connecting DSEC apps to your business
risk speak the language of impact, right?

105
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,170
Translate technical into business
risks, frame vulnerabilities and

106
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:15,750
exposures into terms of potential
business impact, revenue loss,

107
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:22,355
complaints, violations, reputation
damage, not just the technical T codes

108
00:07:23,205 --> 00:07:25,055
aligned with enterprise frameworks.

109
00:07:25,755 --> 00:07:26,085
Right.

110
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:31,544
Integrate Dev Ssec apps with
existing risk management frameworks.

111
00:07:32,174 --> 00:07:37,215
The board reporting on strategic
planning cycles show progress

112
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:43,125
through risk metrics report using
risk deduction metrics that resonate

113
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:48,765
with executive leadership meantime
to remediate the critical exposures.

114
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,789
Attacks, surface face reduction.

115
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:55,440
Control effectiveness,
making system hard to break.

116
00:07:55,739 --> 00:07:57,000
Actionable resilience.

117
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,390
Resilience is built through
a practice, not tools.

118
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:04,289
Look behind your code
quarterly SA security reviews.

119
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:06,270
FMA, enforce access.

120
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:11,099
Annual API Penetration Test what
new pattern within two weeks

121
00:08:11,895 --> 00:08:13,354
and focus on business impact.

122
00:08:13,965 --> 00:08:16,845
Mag technical issues to business impact.

123
00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:19,845
Remediate critical risk within seven days.

124
00:08:20,385 --> 00:08:21,795
Automate security steps.

125
00:08:22,215 --> 00:08:28,335
Integrate S-C-A-T-S-C-A into
CICD, halt critical flaws.

126
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:33,075
Policy as a code for 98% complaints,
configuration as a code for

127
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:36,255
auto fixes within 24 hours.

128
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:39,620
Connect to company goals,
monthly risky meetings.

129
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:45,930
Leadership dashboards to show
reduction attack, surface shrinkage,

130
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,189
automating, measuring and collaborating.

131
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,944
Build resilient systems,
aligning with business goals.

132
00:08:57,045 --> 00:08:57,675
Thank you.

133
00:08:57,705 --> 00:08:59,115
Thank you for engagement.

134
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:02,025
Um, we appreciate your time and attention.

135
00:09:02,385 --> 00:09:07,185
These presentation aim to
provide a valuable insights into

136
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:11,145
building design system through
a risk driven EC app approach.

137
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:20,220
Building resilient system by prioritizing
business impact, automating security and

138
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:26,850
aligned efforts with company goals before
systems that are truly hard to break this

139
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,410
strategy drives continuous implement,
and a proactive security portion.

140
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,470
Uh, you're welcome to
take any questions now.

141
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,040
We are now engaged to hear your
thoughts and questions and look

142
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,370
forward to simulation discussions
and making system hard to break.
