00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,080
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,610
I'm Anmar Karu.

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,450
I've worked in the identity and access
management domain for more than 10 years.

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,320
In that time, I've led programs
in identity governance, privileged

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,760
access, and cloud security.

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:17,539
What I've learned from my experience is I
am isn't just about passing audits, it's

7
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:20,119
about building trust and enabling agility.

8
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:23,849
With that being said, here
is what I'm gonna cover.

9
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:29,954
As part of this today's presentation,
first I'll talk about the challenges

10
00:00:29,954 --> 00:00:34,845
in modern platforms, then how I'm
gonna talk about how identities

11
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:39,914
have evolved, how zero trust,
automation and self-service can help.

12
00:00:40,414 --> 00:00:42,724
Finally, I'll share
results and future trends.

13
00:00:43,355 --> 00:00:49,655
So you can see not just where I am today,
but where it's going to be in the future.

14
00:00:50,345 --> 00:00:51,525
So let's start with the.

15
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,390
Challenges.

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,610
In, in the current state cloud
platforms bring speed, but

17
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,349
they also introduce new risks.

18
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:06,130
All security models like VPNs and
firewalls they don't work anymore.

19
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,080
Developers won't kick access.

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,700
Security teams want tight control
and auditors want clear evidence.

21
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,140
This often leads.

22
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,570
A patchwork of tools that adds
confusion instead of solving problems.

23
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:25,300
So the question is, how do we keep things
secure without slowing the business down?

24
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,575
The answer is to make identity the
heart of security, because as stated

25
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:38,425
in Gartner's report, identity is the
new security boundary Every login.

26
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:43,155
Every a PA call, every device
check is an access decision.

27
00:01:43,815 --> 00:01:48,075
Most breaches happen because of
weak or unmanaged identities,

28
00:01:48,835 --> 00:01:50,215
strong IAM changes that.

29
00:01:50,935 --> 00:01:55,575
Automated access reviews remove
manual work and stop audit issues.

30
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:57,950
Vaulting protects admin accounts.

31
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,430
Single sign-on makes
life easier for users.

32
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:08,170
That's the key difference between
I am blocking progress and I am

33
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:14,659
driving it to see why I am matters
most or I am matters so much.

34
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:17,859
Let's look at how it
has changed over time.

35
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:20,259
We have more through three phases.

36
00:02:20,964 --> 00:02:24,294
The first one being the traditional
enterprise identity, where there is

37
00:02:24,294 --> 00:02:29,954
a centralized ad and VPNs then happen
the cloud description where hundreds

38
00:02:29,954 --> 00:02:31,934
of microservices with their own rules.

39
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:37,754
Now infrastructure as code, where access
rules change as fast as the code itself.

40
00:02:38,254 --> 00:02:41,885
The result is a need for zero trust
and a P first identity platforms.

41
00:02:42,274 --> 00:02:47,494
And with that shift zero trust IAM
isn't optional, it's essential.

42
00:02:48,404 --> 00:02:53,104
Let's see what it looks
like in Practice Zero Trust.

43
00:02:53,104 --> 00:02:53,764
I am.

44
00:02:54,214 --> 00:02:55,804
Let's talk about what is Zero Trust.

45
00:02:56,374 --> 00:03:01,594
It basically means every request
is checked every single time.

46
00:03:02,494 --> 00:03:05,914
Some examples that I've listed
as part of my presentation

47
00:03:05,914 --> 00:03:07,504
is contractors get temporary.

48
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:11,274
Control access with MFA and
just in time provisioning

49
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:13,944
with an access request system.

50
00:03:14,124 --> 00:03:17,124
If an app is connected,
access is granted right away.

51
00:03:17,304 --> 00:03:20,424
If not, a service is
created automatically.

52
00:03:20,484 --> 00:03:23,784
So it's still tracked in
multi-cloud environments.

53
00:03:24,384 --> 00:03:29,574
Identity platforms like IGA, PAM and
so work together as one control plane.

54
00:03:30,564 --> 00:03:32,394
These use cases reduce risk.

55
00:03:32,784 --> 00:03:35,664
And make access
predictable and controlled.

56
00:03:36,164 --> 00:03:41,435
Now let's look at the tools
and the platform and the

57
00:03:41,435 --> 00:03:42,845
patterns that make them work.

58
00:03:43,345 --> 00:03:47,395
To deliver zero trust in practice,
you need the right tools and patterns.

59
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:52,525
Key results come from automated
access reviews, pom pam vaulting

60
00:03:52,585 --> 00:03:56,725
and SSO integrations in some
environments like Kubernetes.

61
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:02,155
Teams use namespace isolation
or automated policy validation.

62
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:06,535
I focus more on I aim, but the
principle is always the same and

63
00:04:06,535 --> 00:04:12,174
force least privilege and validate
the access before it's granted.

64
00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:17,965
And once you have those patents
in place, the next step is to make

65
00:04:18,054 --> 00:04:22,664
compliance continuous instead of one-off.

66
00:04:23,164 --> 00:04:28,625
In the past, compliance meant big
review cycles and analyst spreadsheets.

67
00:04:29,555 --> 00:04:34,805
Now we can make it continuous by
treating compliance like code, which

68
00:04:34,835 --> 00:04:40,565
means checklists built into workflows,
automated reminders, reports that

69
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:41,825
are audit auditory all the time.

70
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:48,405
This doesn't just cut audit hours, it
builds trust that compliance is always on.

71
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:53,064
Not just checked once or twice
a year, and automation like this

72
00:04:53,244 --> 00:04:55,194
doesn't just help with compliance.

73
00:04:55,584 --> 00:04:58,674
It improves everyday
identity operations too.

74
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:02,924
Here is what an identity
automation can deliver.

75
00:05:03,424 --> 00:05:08,344
Zero audit flags, thanks to automated
reviews, documentation improvements.

76
00:05:08,405 --> 00:05:13,764
And reports that are built, which would
save hundreds of hours of time, identity

77
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:18,204
intelligence, which would, you know
generate the access recommendations

78
00:05:18,924 --> 00:05:23,764
for for the reviewers to make an
effective access review decision before

79
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:26,444
before an access is kept or revoked.

80
00:05:26,944 --> 00:05:31,204
With that being said, this is,
we are at a phase where this

81
00:05:31,204 --> 00:05:35,464
is all data driven, accurate,
efficient, and trusted and better.

82
00:05:35,464 --> 00:05:42,509
Im also makes life easier for
developers because that it's clear that

83
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,179
developers can't wait weeks for access.

84
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:46,829
Self-service solves that.

85
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:48,919
Think about service catalogs.

86
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:53,209
Automated key management or
simple web-based account creation.

87
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:56,629
Developers move faster,
security, stress and control,

88
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,059
and tickets code on that Balance.

89
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:03,754
Speed with safety empowers developers
without compromising on the governance.

90
00:06:04,254 --> 00:06:09,999
Here is an industry case study that
shows what it looks like in action.

91
00:06:10,614 --> 00:06:14,184
In healthcare, the challenge,
the common challenge that we see

92
00:06:14,184 --> 00:06:19,074
is managing access of patient's
data while staying by compliant.

93
00:06:19,554 --> 00:06:24,234
The solution used zero trust, automated
provisioning and self-service patterns.

94
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:28,914
The result provisioning time
dropped from days to under 12 hours.

95
00:06:29,184 --> 00:06:32,609
Incidents went down and audit
preparation got much faster.

96
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:38,649
And whether it's healthcare, finance, or
technology, the lesson is always the same.

97
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:44,519
Automation plus zero trust
equals faster and safer access.

98
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:49,639
Now let's bring these results
into one clear framework.

99
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:57,159
Here is how I measure success
security machines, zero audit flags.

100
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:02,139
Operations means weaker
testing, fewer poisoning errors.

101
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,739
Compliance means the number of reports
that were automated, which would I

102
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:12,119
turn save hundreds of hours per each
business cycle, and the business impact

103
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,899
dozens of new applications that were
onboarded without slowing the delivery.

104
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:21,664
So I am isn't just about audits, it's
about reducing errors, saving time,

105
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:23,549
and enabling the faster delivery.

106
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:29,179
And finally, let's look at
where I am is going next.

107
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:35,249
As we look ahead, in my experience, I'm
noticing three big trends that stand out.

108
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:40,379
The first one being the converged
iam, which means identity governance

109
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:44,699
platforms and privileged access
platforms will no longer be separates.

110
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:49,319
They'll unify into one platform
giving a complete view of

111
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:51,509
human and mission identities.

112
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:54,649
The second one being
automation first governance.

113
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:56,019
Reviews.

114
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,769
Evidence collection and policy
checks will move from manual work

115
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:01,089
to always on automat automation.

116
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:04,199
And the third one being identity in ai.

117
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:09,779
As AI becomes part of our daily
operations, I a must evolve to govern

118
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:12,269
both people and intelligent agents.

119
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:15,014
That's where non-human
identities comes into picture.

120
00:08:15,514 --> 00:08:19,234
Now, NHA governance is equally
critical because there has been a

121
00:08:19,234 --> 00:08:23,284
lot of intelligent agents that have
been spun up on a day-to-day basis.

122
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:28,534
The end goal is, I am, that feels
invisible, always working in the

123
00:08:28,534 --> 00:08:34,734
background, always enforcing trust and
never slowing people down, and that's

124
00:08:34,824 --> 00:08:39,885
the real future of identity security,
not as a barrier, but as an enabler.

125
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:43,150
Once Gartner said, identity
is a new perimeter.

126
00:08:43,265 --> 00:08:45,635
Perimeter and trust is a new currency.

127
00:08:46,135 --> 00:08:50,515
Thank you for your time today and
after more than a decade in I am.

128
00:08:50,545 --> 00:08:54,714
I can say this with confidence, that
identity is no longer just it plumbing.

129
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,295
It's the foundation of
secure and agile platforms.

130
00:08:57,295 --> 00:08:57,474
Thank you.
