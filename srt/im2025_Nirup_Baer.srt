1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,880
Hi, this is Niro.

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,070
Thanks for being here.

3
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:08,090
This talks about one practical idea,
which is to make compliance a built-in

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,060
feature of how we design and run systems.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,800
So in financial services the scale is huge
and trillions of dollars move every day.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,100
So when a system pauses even
for a moment real people feel

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,200
it and the cost cleanse fast.

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,000
So our aim is simple.

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,420
A system that rarely fails and when
they do, they recover quickly and leave

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,700
a clean trail of evidence as they go.

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,810
So that way teams moves faster with
confidence and customers feel safe.

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,565
The proof we need is created
as part of normal work.

13
00:00:42,385 --> 00:00:46,655
So if that's the goal, let's round
it to the world we all live in.

14
00:00:47,155 --> 00:00:48,565
The financial services challenge.

15
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:49,495
So here's the reality.

16
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:54,815
So millions touch real
balances and real trust.

17
00:00:55,205 --> 00:00:59,345
People expect services to be
there whenever they need them.

18
00:00:59,445 --> 00:01:03,075
So threats move fast and patients is shot.

19
00:01:03,385 --> 00:01:08,215
And when something goes wrong the cost
shows up in both money and reputation.

20
00:01:08,725 --> 00:01:12,145
That, that's why instant management
cannot sit on the sidelines.

21
00:01:12,245 --> 00:01:16,835
It sits where reliability,
regulation and brand meet.

22
00:01:17,435 --> 00:01:22,045
That instant is not only technical, it
can also be business and regulatory.

23
00:01:22,855 --> 00:01:27,265
Our methods must respect
all three at once.

24
00:01:27,565 --> 00:01:31,935
So how do we make a safe
path, also an easy path?

25
00:01:32,435 --> 00:01:35,495
So that's where the the
modernization helps.

26
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:42,435
So why cloud modernization now
modernization is not only go faster.

27
00:01:42,915 --> 00:01:45,705
It is set better defaults.

28
00:01:46,195 --> 00:01:51,155
So when the safe path is
also the fast path teams stop

29
00:01:51,155 --> 00:01:53,285
negotiating and start building.

30
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,405
So we use.

31
00:01:54,855 --> 00:02:00,115
Repeatable patterns for networks,
identity storage and compute.

32
00:02:00,574 --> 00:02:04,685
We put clear rules in the
build and release steps.

33
00:02:04,695 --> 00:02:07,034
So risky changes never reach customers.

34
00:02:07,624 --> 00:02:12,659
We keep unchangeable logs so the
system can tell its own story later.

35
00:02:13,104 --> 00:02:16,644
The result is fewer surprises
and calm our operations.

36
00:02:17,144 --> 00:02:18,614
Quick proof from the field.

37
00:02:18,844 --> 00:02:19,889
Then we'll keep moving.

38
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:27,114
So we moved to a fragile service into a
landing zone with strong guard race, same

39
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:31,804
team, same code, the next instant did
not feel like a fire drill gone wrong.

40
00:02:31,804 --> 00:02:34,204
It felt like a drill we
had already practiced.

41
00:02:34,494 --> 00:02:35,664
We knew what changed.

42
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:41,224
When it changed and the safe path back
that's the power of good defaults.

43
00:02:41,254 --> 00:02:45,414
Now let's talk about compliance
as a built in advantage.

44
00:02:46,174 --> 00:02:51,724
So think of compliance like seed
belts designed into a performance car.

45
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:56,919
Now the car still moves fast, but safety
is part of the experience from the start.

46
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:02,029
For us, that means approved reference
designs reusable building blocks

47
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:06,849
and evidence that is created
automatically during day-to-day work.

48
00:03:07,339 --> 00:03:11,629
So reviews get shorter and
then rework drops and releases

49
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:13,249
become more, more predictable.

50
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:18,169
Customers notice our stability
and regulators notice clarity, and

51
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:20,084
then leaders see steady delivery.

52
00:03:20,584 --> 00:03:22,114
And this isn't extra paperwork.

53
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:25,864
It's the system proving
itself while we built it.

54
00:03:26,364 --> 00:03:30,284
If compliance is a feature
what rules are we encoding?

55
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:32,624
Let's let's map the let landscape here.

56
00:03:33,294 --> 00:03:37,849
So rules are a map of
what society cares about.

57
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,179
Some focus on accurate
reporting and fair markets.

58
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:45,069
Someone privacy and proper use of data.

59
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,214
Someone banking safety and open payments.

60
00:03:48,264 --> 00:03:51,594
Newer ones focus on operational
resilience and responsible use

61
00:03:51,594 --> 00:03:54,204
of learning systems like ai.

62
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:57,094
We do not need to memorize
like every chapter return.

63
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:02,149
Each team into code and steps
label and product sensitive data

64
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:08,479
from the staff plan, fail and
practice them and keep records.

65
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:11,959
Person outside the team can
understand in, in minutes.

66
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:18,604
With the clear data let's look at
how the how in our architecture.

67
00:04:19,104 --> 00:04:22,454
So let's take a look at the
hybrid and multi-cloud strategies.

68
00:04:23,414 --> 00:04:27,034
Architecture is where
promises become real, right?

69
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:32,284
So we manage policy and visibility
across the company while keeping

70
00:04:32,284 --> 00:04:37,444
sensitive customer data in the
region where it belongs that respects

71
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,019
data rules without losing control.

72
00:04:39,954 --> 00:04:46,414
We designed for small pla radius
clear boundaries between services and

73
00:04:46,414 --> 00:04:52,399
sensible timeouts and retries and fast
ways to switch off risky features.

74
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,884
So we practice failovers
until they then become boring.

75
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:01,119
For the most critical systems we
run so living more than one place.

76
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:05,039
For others we keep a warm backup
that can take off quickly.

77
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:09,369
So one picture to lock it in, then
we'll deliver it to be like, gonna

78
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:12,759
dive into a, to a two examples, right?

79
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:13,929
So think of a highway.

80
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:19,119
Each service has its own lane with
dividers and and the shoulder.

81
00:05:20,049 --> 00:05:24,239
If a tire blows in one lane,
the road doesn't shut down.

82
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:28,739
Those drivers and shoulders
are your boundaries.

83
00:05:28,739 --> 00:05:29,459
Timeouts.

84
00:05:30,284 --> 00:05:32,474
Retries and feature switches.

85
00:05:33,414 --> 00:05:39,744
Now three short stories that kind
of shows this in action, right?

86
00:05:40,314 --> 00:05:47,634
So regulatory reporting, reporting
move from, or batches to real time

87
00:05:47,634 --> 00:05:52,094
streams instead of finding delays
tomorrow we saw them in minutes.

88
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:53,164
Each step.

89
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:55,474
Wrote an unchangeable record.

90
00:05:55,474 --> 00:05:57,814
So the audit story was already there.

91
00:05:58,244 --> 00:06:02,914
So reports that took like
days random minutes audit prep

92
00:06:02,914 --> 00:06:05,264
that took weeks took days.

93
00:06:05,924 --> 00:06:09,464
So when a delay happened, we
could point to the exact stage

94
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:14,464
that can slow down or show what
was affected and proven recovery.

95
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:15,784
As finished.

96
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:20,124
So the accuracy went up and the
cost went down and the trust.

97
00:06:20,334 --> 00:06:21,054
Trust improved.

98
00:06:21,594 --> 00:06:23,824
Alright, let's take a look
at the next case study.

99
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:28,409
So basically we wanted to
stop bad transactions without

100
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:30,029
bothering good customers.

101
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:34,654
The turning point was managing the
whole model lifecycle not the score.

102
00:06:35,154 --> 00:06:36,804
So the data is data, it uses.

103
00:06:36,804 --> 00:06:41,484
Nicholas stayed fresh, so any
change needed the right approval.

104
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:45,534
So if a new version misbehaved, we
could return to the last version.

105
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:48,399
Just one, one decision.

106
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:51,054
And we could explain what changed and why.

107
00:06:51,864 --> 00:06:57,034
So file alarm dropped, losses dropped,
and investigators chased better signals.

108
00:06:57,934 --> 00:06:58,894
We have another example.

109
00:06:59,124 --> 00:07:00,714
So last example here.

110
00:07:00,764 --> 00:07:02,834
This is like speed and
discipline and trading.

111
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:03,854
So this case study.

112
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:10,259
So surveillance moved from after
the fact to real time and limits

113
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:13,099
were enforced as orders flowed.

114
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:19,399
So unusual patterns were flat as so
the records of this checks traveled

115
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,619
side by side with the with the trades.

116
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:26,289
So in a market search, the
system did not ask for a meeting.

117
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:28,059
It followed a safe playbook.

118
00:07:28,104 --> 00:07:33,984
So incidents were shorter and reviews
were clearer and confidence from the

119
00:07:33,994 --> 00:07:36,854
business and from regulators improved.

120
00:07:37,754 --> 00:07:43,274
So following these three case
studies, so what makes these wins?

121
00:07:43,454 --> 00:07:44,054
Repeatable?

122
00:07:44,624 --> 00:07:49,939
Foundation of all these is on the
on the next slide infrastructure as.

123
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:55,629
Write down how environments must
look and let the platform build

124
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:57,319
them from that description.

125
00:07:57,799 --> 00:08:02,539
So new plat, new environments
run aligned to standards.

126
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:04,329
Identities set correctly.

127
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:07,019
Networks are segmented the right way.

128
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,239
Storage is locked as intended.

129
00:08:10,184 --> 00:08:16,214
Changes happen through a clear
view instead of one-off tweets

130
00:08:16,814 --> 00:08:18,044
if something goes wrong.

131
00:08:18,494 --> 00:08:21,789
Returning to a good known state
is quick because a platform

132
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:23,649
knows what good looks like.

133
00:08:24,429 --> 00:08:28,169
The rules sit next to the
configuration and the application.

134
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,349
What changed and why, and all question.

135
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:33,559
Move faster and auditor.

136
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,089
See the exact history.

137
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,819
Now, let's put safety rules into a daily.

138
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:45,399
Instead of quarterly checklist we place
rules directly into the build and release

139
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,799
steps basically, and into the platform.

140
00:08:48,609 --> 00:08:53,899
If a setting would expose a data or
open a risky path it does not pass.

141
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,019
The system explains which rule
was violated and how, and shows

142
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:00,739
the approved pattern, right?

143
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:06,419
This turns long review meetings
with fast, clear feedback while

144
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:07,829
the work was still in progress.

145
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:10,409
Most issues are minutes.

146
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:16,369
Platform also creates detailed
timestamp record of what's fired and

147
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:18,149
who changed what and how it was fixed.

148
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:21,649
These kind of records is
like goal for audits and for

149
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:23,889
learning after the instance.

150
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:27,389
So let's tackle this in daily habits.

151
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:32,539
So bring six earlier in the
development when fixes and.

152
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,699
Classified data and applied
privacy controls by default.

153
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:41,219
So sensitive information is handled
correctly without traffic, keep logs in

154
00:09:41,219 --> 00:09:43,579
a way that cannot be quietly rewritten.

155
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:48,639
Rehearse resilience like a fire drill
or failover and emergency moves.

156
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,774
Feel familiar and not scared.

157
00:09:51,274 --> 00:09:56,624
Product feels solid to customers and
the platform feels same to operate.

158
00:09:57,094 --> 00:10:02,804
Launches are smoother and incidents
are fewer time spent proving compliance

159
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:04,874
shifts towards improving the customers.

160
00:10:05,374 --> 00:10:07,654
So even things break motion.

161
00:10:07,969 --> 00:10:10,429
So the instant management and compliance.

162
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:12,744
So basically just keep it steady practice.

163
00:10:12,924 --> 00:10:14,119
We practice it all.

164
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:15,049
Let's keep it steady.

165
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,954
Confirm the signal and decide how serious
it's start a clean log right away.

166
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:21,754
Pause.

167
00:10:21,814 --> 00:10:23,254
Risky change paths.

168
00:10:24,064 --> 00:10:27,764
Use free pre-approved moves,
like switching off a feature or

169
00:10:27,764 --> 00:10:31,394
limiting a traffic or failing
failing out to a safe location.

170
00:10:32,219 --> 00:10:34,629
Communicate in plain
language to right people.

171
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:39,129
So while you work let the system
collect facts current settings,

172
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:44,079
recent changes, who had access key
measurements on the trace of what

173
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:46,659
you know, what and who, et cetera.

174
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:52,179
And don't call it fixed until the service
holds steady for a meaningful window.

175
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:57,989
This protects customers and creates
evidence to explain what happened

176
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:05,019
and why the fixed work what does this
bias, what does this actually buy us?

177
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:09,509
So let's talk about the outcomes, the
actual outcome or the business impact.

178
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,039
So when safety and compliance are.

179
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:14,184
Part of the platform.

180
00:11:14,404 --> 00:11:17,074
New environments come online
quickly and predictably.

181
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:19,569
Recovery is faster and less dramatic.

182
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:24,549
Conversations with regulators are
clearer because your evidence is

183
00:11:24,669 --> 00:11:26,409
produced as part of normal work.

184
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:31,909
Customers notice reliability, leaders
see momentum, and every incident becomes

185
00:11:31,969 --> 00:11:34,874
a chance to improve our platform itself.

186
00:11:35,374 --> 00:11:39,124
After the fix works, promoted to
the shared template, so the next

187
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:41,564
team never meets the same problem.

188
00:11:42,074 --> 00:11:46,919
So over time speed, reliability
and audit readiness race together

189
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:48,959
instead of, fighting with each other.

190
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:51,929
So what should you do?

191
00:11:52,349 --> 00:11:54,389
Say next week, right?

192
00:11:54,719 --> 00:11:56,729
Start with one visible win.

193
00:11:57,599 --> 00:12:02,639
Stick a single painful control
that burns time on fiction.

194
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,149
Automate it from end to end.

195
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:09,889
Place it inside a golden path
that teams can use right away.

196
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:16,369
Make the path the fastest way to
production, not just the most compliant

197
00:12:16,374 --> 00:12:20,984
with, give the path and owner at a
short public list of improvements.

198
00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:27,224
Each month measure a few signals of
how often you make your service promise

199
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:31,674
and how long it takes to recover,
how many changes or struggle, and how

200
00:12:31,674 --> 00:12:33,444
many hours you save in audit work.

201
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:38,244
Share the trend so people can
see progress and repeat it.

202
00:12:38,364 --> 00:12:39,914
The next high value control.

203
00:12:40,724 --> 00:12:41,969
It's really that simple.

204
00:12:42,469 --> 00:12:45,799
Okay, that brings us to
the end of a presentation.

205
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:49,459
Remember, reliability and
compliance are not enemies.

206
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:54,909
When we build safety into the path of
production and practice, our response

207
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:58,449
incidents become rarer, shorter and safer.

208
00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:02,999
Story you tell regulators become the
same story you tell engineers because

209
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:05,399
both comes straight from the system.

210
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:09,139
Every time you improve the shared
template, you give a gift to the

211
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:11,299
next team and to the next customer.

212
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:13,904
Let's make trust or advantage and.
