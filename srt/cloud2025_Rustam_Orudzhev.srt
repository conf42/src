1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,010
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,050
I'm Rustam.

3
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,470
I spent my entire career with telecom,
with big tech companies, launching

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,270
products and looking after products.

5
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:12,730
And today I want to share something
very interesting with you.

6
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:17,660
It's a retail evolution and
particularly it's cloud powered aspect.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,920
Story that we will go through today
is basically around what is going

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,920
on currently in retail industry.

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,610
Where is the industry going and how.

10
00:00:28,085 --> 00:00:33,845
Retail with the help of cloud will
be serving future needs of customers.

11
00:00:34,345 --> 00:00:36,445
I will start with a storyline on a page.

12
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:39,695
It's always easier to have a
helicopter view on everything

13
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:40,645
that we will go through.

14
00:00:41,615 --> 00:00:44,375
And the story is very simple and engaging.

15
00:00:44,854 --> 00:00:47,204
First of all, cloud transforms retail.

16
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,675
There is no doubt about that.

17
00:00:49,505 --> 00:00:52,535
And cloud makes it very
personal and very engaging.

18
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:54,835
It's also smart and scalable.

19
00:00:55,335 --> 00:00:58,135
Pandemic, as we remember,
sped up that transformation.

20
00:00:58,135 --> 00:01:03,345
You remember that everything suddenly
stopped and then went online where cloud

21
00:01:03,345 --> 00:01:10,074
essentially helped cloud reinvented
the stores and it's now more, it's,

22
00:01:10,074 --> 00:01:13,664
if it's a physical store, it's more,
experience hop rather than the traditional

23
00:01:13,664 --> 00:01:19,384
store 10 years, 15 years ago, omni
channel is definitely driven by the

24
00:01:19,384 --> 00:01:25,334
cloud and the customer journey, very
dependent on the cloud and the weight.

25
00:01:25,684 --> 00:01:28,324
mixes the online and offline journeys.

26
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:35,294
And finally, future is advanced cloud
technologies with AI, with machine

27
00:01:35,294 --> 00:01:37,854
learning, with the internet of things.

28
00:01:38,454 --> 00:01:43,554
we will be able to see a much better
transformed retail going forward.

29
00:01:43,594 --> 00:01:48,724
And part of that transformation we already
experienced today, but bear with me.

30
00:01:48,754 --> 00:01:51,054
We will get there, in a couple of minutes.

31
00:01:51,554 --> 00:01:54,044
Let's start with the
transformative role of the cloud.

32
00:01:54,544 --> 00:01:55,674
So this is the.

33
00:01:56,204 --> 00:02:00,264
market somewhere in London,
in early 20th century.

34
00:02:00,344 --> 00:02:03,144
And this is also retail, right?

35
00:02:03,144 --> 00:02:08,134
So this is the retail where you see
customers coming and going, picking

36
00:02:08,134 --> 00:02:13,174
up what they want, strolling, going
through different stuff, checking

37
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:16,744
prices, et cetera, et cetera,
all in an offline environment.

38
00:02:16,754 --> 00:02:21,164
That's the retail we had for centuries.

39
00:02:22,124 --> 00:02:28,174
Now, it's rapidly changing quicker
and faster and quicker and faster.

40
00:02:28,674 --> 00:02:34,144
And basically, the question in front
of retail, I think, is how to be

41
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,174
relevant, personal and delightful.

42
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:42,904
And that's a very big question
because now consumers are much more

43
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:49,984
picky and much more demanding versus
a consumer of 10, 15, 20 years ago.

44
00:02:50,484 --> 00:02:53,294
And of course, cloud is
the catalyst for change.

45
00:02:54,064 --> 00:02:58,254
If you look at the role of the cloud
for retail transformation, you will

46
00:02:58,254 --> 00:03:02,894
see that it's innovation with advanced
technologies, such as AI and machine

47
00:03:02,894 --> 00:03:07,924
learning, all those chatbots and,
smart stores, everything is dependent

48
00:03:07,974 --> 00:03:13,164
on the cloud, retail analytic and
personalization is imperative right now.

49
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:18,004
Everything is in the cloud
and basically no one.

50
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:22,694
will be able to deliver top
quality service without a

51
00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:24,954
cloud umbrella, helping them.

52
00:03:25,724 --> 00:03:31,104
Omni channel, again, the way
offline and online are mixed.

53
00:03:31,684 --> 00:03:32,414
Is it seamless?

54
00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:33,224
Yes or no?

55
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:35,404
Everything dependent on the cloud.

56
00:03:36,014 --> 00:03:42,314
Cloud delivers scalability and flexibility
so that retailers can very quickly

57
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:45,794
adjust, to, ever evolving customer needs.

58
00:03:46,324 --> 00:03:49,344
And of course it's cost
efficient and agile.

59
00:03:49,414 --> 00:03:56,544
So Without the cloud, I think retail, will
not be able to transform and to evolve

60
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:59,074
up to the standard of the new customer.

61
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:05,014
Today we will see where all the
world's best companies are going,

62
00:04:05,154 --> 00:04:09,684
because I think it's very important
to just go through the cases and

63
00:04:09,704 --> 00:04:12,154
this will give us, food for thought.

64
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:19,654
Of where does the next retail step
is leading us and let's start with

65
00:04:19,764 --> 00:04:26,174
the Walmart because I think Walmart
is a great example of the company

66
00:04:26,204 --> 00:04:31,414
that understood the importance of
cloud migration like 15 years ago.

67
00:04:31,884 --> 00:04:35,464
So they started as early as in, 2010.

68
00:04:35,964 --> 00:04:40,854
Always step by step evolving in that
process, partnering with, Microsoft

69
00:04:40,854 --> 00:04:45,174
Azure, and we will get to that
platform a little bit, later during the

70
00:04:45,174 --> 00:04:50,744
presentation, they launched different
solutions and even today, this cloud

71
00:04:50,744 --> 00:04:53,194
transformation of Walmart is not done.

72
00:04:53,864 --> 00:04:54,984
So it's ongoing.

73
00:04:55,164 --> 00:05:02,349
And again, this giant, understands
that Without the cloud retail

74
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:03,999
will not exist going forward.

75
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:09,879
And even today it's, it will lose the,
I think the most of its competitiveness.

76
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:15,339
Comparison of pandemic, pre pandemic,
post pandemic, just to remind everyone,

77
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:19,949
so I will not pause on this slide for
long, but just a high level overview.

78
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:24,909
Before COVID, we remember
physical retail was dominated and

79
00:05:24,929 --> 00:05:27,069
online was a supporting channel.

80
00:05:27,854 --> 00:05:28,834
Now it's different.

81
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:34,274
So now everything is, driven by innovation
and physical retail becomes more,

82
00:05:34,324 --> 00:05:37,274
experience up and online become essential.

83
00:05:38,124 --> 00:05:41,874
So that's a massive difference
between what we had back

84
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,074
then and what we have now.

85
00:05:44,074 --> 00:05:45,384
And omni channel.

86
00:05:45,884 --> 00:05:48,314
It was mostly fragmented back then.

87
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:53,534
Now the experience of Omnichannel
become more and more crucial.

88
00:05:54,034 --> 00:05:58,999
And it becomes, I think overall, at
least in the economies, economies

89
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:05,179
like, our economy here in the UK, it
becomes, seamless and really crucial

90
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,629
for, the proper customer experience.

91
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:10,219
And of course, we already mentioned the.

92
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,369
Cloud enabled agility, data analytics.

93
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,089
Now it's a must have.

94
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:19,599
So you can't, develop your retail.

95
00:06:19,609 --> 00:06:21,099
You can't sell stuff.

96
00:06:21,604 --> 00:06:27,534
Without cloud enabled, data analytics
personalization, it's simply not possible.

97
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:31,854
So let's now look at the role
of physical and online stores.

98
00:06:32,314 --> 00:06:37,184
And I think the most important
thing is that now we only go to

99
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:38,994
physical store if we want to.

100
00:06:39,714 --> 00:06:42,264
We never go there because
we have to, right?

101
00:06:42,854 --> 00:06:44,704
We go there because we want to.

102
00:06:44,944 --> 00:06:47,634
Everything can be ordered
online, more or less.

103
00:06:47,634 --> 00:06:52,179
So if we want a special experience,
If we want touch and try only

104
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:57,159
then we choose Deliberately choose
to go to physical retail store

105
00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:05,129
and to give you an example of shops beyond
shopping Let's start with the Nike live

106
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:11,279
stores example first of all, they provide
real time community engagement, which

107
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,959
means that you can come to that store.

108
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:18,649
Just look at this nice picture on your
screen and you can spend your time there.

109
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:21,699
You can discuss new
products with professionals.

110
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:23,399
You can choose your products.

111
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:27,129
If you want to, you can attend
an event hosted by Nike.

112
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:29,199
So it's a great concept.

113
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:30,669
We never had before.

114
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,459
Of course, it's, also data driven
personalization because cloud based

115
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:42,979
analytics tailoring everything to customer
preferences and purchasing behaviors,

116
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:46,459
Nike application, the smartphone one.

117
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,119
This is very important because.

118
00:07:48,494 --> 00:07:52,274
the integration is crucial for
the right experience in the store.

119
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:55,754
And of course, Nike are deeply integrated.

120
00:07:55,754 --> 00:08:01,174
So customers can reserve products,
they can access exclusive offers.

121
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:04,904
And if it's a Nike plus members,
they will get something very

122
00:08:04,904 --> 00:08:06,934
special tailored exactly for them.

123
00:08:07,434 --> 00:08:11,804
in store technology, also cloud
based in, Nike live stores, for

124
00:08:11,804 --> 00:08:17,414
example, every sales person, people,
equipped with cloud connected devices.

125
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:22,154
They know in advance from customer
profiles, what to offer to that customer.

126
00:08:22,684 --> 00:08:27,384
And of course, omni channel
integration is perfect online, offline.

127
00:08:27,394 --> 00:08:33,484
You will not feel the gap there so you
can start your journey in Nike online

128
00:08:33,484 --> 00:08:37,084
store and finish it in Nike offline store.

129
00:08:37,394 --> 00:08:39,234
Everything is in place.

130
00:08:39,734 --> 00:08:45,654
Then let's think for a moment of the,
about the evolution of online stores.

131
00:08:45,964 --> 00:08:50,174
The key thing here, I think that
online shopping takes over offline.

132
00:08:50,274 --> 00:08:55,894
That's definitely a fact, especially after
the pandemic, as we saw, three minutes

133
00:08:55,894 --> 00:09:01,894
ago, if we think about this and I've put
a screenshot of, the, one of the biggest

134
00:09:01,894 --> 00:09:07,424
and the best and most advanced retailers,
online retailers out there at the Amazon.

135
00:09:08,024 --> 00:09:13,394
if we think about this, Evolution is,
first of all, scalability and flexibility.

136
00:09:13,494 --> 00:09:19,424
online stores are easier to scale
operation, versus the physical stores

137
00:09:19,454 --> 00:09:21,494
because of their online nature.

138
00:09:22,034 --> 00:09:25,794
And with the help of cloud
technology, it's even easier.

139
00:09:26,464 --> 00:09:29,394
Personalization, and again, I
already said a few times that

140
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:31,924
personalization is It is a must.

141
00:09:32,134 --> 00:09:36,754
It's imperative now for modern
retail, real time data analytics

142
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:42,784
allow this advanced personalization
to work flawlessly for the customer.

143
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:48,134
everything is integrated,
seamlessly and especially the third

144
00:09:48,214 --> 00:09:52,554
party services we know all the
payments, engines, the inventory

145
00:09:52,554 --> 00:09:54,734
systems that retailers are using.

146
00:09:55,384 --> 00:09:58,364
Everything is based on the
cloud and integrated seamlessly.

147
00:09:59,104 --> 00:10:04,174
Of course, security and compliance,
the GDPR, everything is very

148
00:10:04,174 --> 00:10:06,634
important and also cloud driven.

149
00:10:07,384 --> 00:10:11,504
And of course, the enhanced
omni channel experience where.

150
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:14,744
Cloud technology delivers a
consistent shopping experience

151
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:18,534
across all the websites and
applications and physical store.

152
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:24,394
That's basically in five simple
steps, the key highlights of the

153
00:10:24,434 --> 00:10:27,064
online evolution based on the cloud.

154
00:10:27,564 --> 00:10:29,264
And here is another example.

155
00:10:29,284 --> 00:10:35,674
So I think Shopify, it is a great
example of how empowering business

156
00:10:35,714 --> 00:10:41,924
of all sizes to basically be able to
scale of how important this task is.

157
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:48,719
In case of the Shopify cloud platform,
first of all, it's a global scaling,

158
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:54,929
literally almost in any country out there,
becomes a portlet because Shopify has.

159
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:58,134
infrastructure dispersed across the globe.

160
00:10:58,914 --> 00:11:02,024
Then of course, it's simplified
international expansion.

161
00:11:02,024 --> 00:11:07,194
If you want to launch your store
after launching in the UK, say into,

162
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:13,964
I don't know, Ireland or in the EU,
Shopify will help you with that.

163
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:19,924
of course, that's also integrated,
commercial solutions when the cloud

164
00:11:19,924 --> 00:11:22,214
based tools for inventory payments.

165
00:11:22,674 --> 00:11:23,574
or shipping.

166
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:26,704
Everything is, provided to a retailer.

167
00:11:27,404 --> 00:11:32,244
Customization and innovation also very
important because it enables businesses

168
00:11:32,244 --> 00:11:35,154
to customize stores with apps and APIs.

169
00:11:35,924 --> 00:11:37,844
And it's for all businesses out there.

170
00:11:37,844 --> 00:11:41,024
So for example, you
need a 24 seven support.

171
00:11:41,054 --> 00:11:42,904
You got it from Shopify platform.

172
00:11:43,274 --> 00:11:47,644
You can lowering entry barriers
and, enable global success through

173
00:11:47,644 --> 00:11:49,464
cloud based e commerce that way.

174
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:55,619
So that's an example of empowering
businesses of any sizes to scale

175
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,869
based on the cloud technologies.

176
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:03,629
Netflix, I think they are kings of
advanced real time personalization.

177
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:11,979
And I think that, as a great example,
Netflix can literally in the, in almost in

178
00:12:11,979 --> 00:12:19,854
real time, offer based on your preferences
and the videos you viewed or, even the,

179
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:24,994
pages that you browsed when you were,
when you've been looking for a movie,

180
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:32,564
it can fine tune very personalized, very
you tailored recommendations for you.

181
00:12:33,024 --> 00:12:39,074
And I think that capability of giving
advanced recommendations is very

182
00:12:39,124 --> 00:12:41,244
unique for, for the modern retail.

183
00:12:41,624 --> 00:12:46,244
It's something we've never had, or
even dreamt of 10, 15 years ago.

184
00:12:46,574 --> 00:12:50,764
it's here today within the best
retailers and the best content

185
00:12:50,774 --> 00:12:52,164
providers, such as Netflix.

186
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:56,104
And it's going to be more and
more important going forward.

187
00:12:56,604 --> 00:13:00,404
Of course, they are also masters
of scalable cloud infrastructure

188
00:13:00,564 --> 00:13:02,604
because it's content, right?

189
00:13:02,644 --> 00:13:03,244
And it's.

190
00:13:03,794 --> 00:13:10,644
I have heavy content, especially
if it's a 4k HDR movies, right?

191
00:13:10,644 --> 00:13:14,054
So they can do that based
on their cloud solutions.

192
00:13:14,554 --> 00:13:19,884
Of course, the user interfaces, they
have everything personalized from

193
00:13:19,954 --> 00:13:22,924
artwork to previews and the layouts.

194
00:13:23,424 --> 00:13:27,984
And it's under continuous improvements
because they test and refine and

195
00:13:27,984 --> 00:13:33,544
leveraging AI and machine learning
to make New suggestions even better.

196
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:38,994
So that's the netflix example of real
time personalization Now let's switch

197
00:13:38,994 --> 00:13:44,404
to omni channel and how it's enabled
by cloud I have nordstrom's unified

198
00:13:44,404 --> 00:13:49,934
commerce example here how they sync
Inventory and customer data in online

199
00:13:49,934 --> 00:13:56,664
and offline and basically if we go only
through highlights, of course, it's very

200
00:13:56,664 --> 00:14:02,954
good for consistent customer engagement
because cloud platforms Unify marketing

201
00:14:02,954 --> 00:14:09,184
and support across all the channels like
application online in store ensuring

202
00:14:09,194 --> 00:14:14,574
that the No, some basically can assist
customers whenever and wherever they

203
00:14:14,574 --> 00:14:19,774
need Of course, it's seamless some
seamless omni channel experience and

204
00:14:20,094 --> 00:14:25,076
we already I think know how important
that is Remember the nike example.

205
00:14:25,076 --> 00:14:27,211
It's unified customer profiles.

206
00:14:27,211 --> 00:14:33,024
So All the data, customer data in
the cloud stored securely, but most

207
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:39,284
importantly, it's stored across all
the channels, like in a one storage.

208
00:14:39,284 --> 00:14:42,024
So it's always in sync and it's unified.

209
00:14:43,004 --> 00:14:48,524
of course, as a modern retailer, they
care about real time inventory updates.

210
00:14:49,024 --> 00:14:54,354
And especially it's important for services
like, buy online, pick up and store.

211
00:14:54,854 --> 00:14:59,964
And finally, last but not the
least, optimized order fulfillment.

212
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:05,784
So cloud technology turns stores, into
fulfillment centers, basically determining

213
00:15:05,794 --> 00:15:11,174
the best location to ship, online orders
based on the location of the customer.

214
00:15:11,674 --> 00:15:14,814
Now let's look at evolution
of retail with cloud.

215
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:18,094
I have targets predictive
analytics example here.

216
00:15:18,094 --> 00:15:19,534
I think we all know target.

217
00:15:19,564 --> 00:15:26,044
it's, massive, retailer, and they
really utilizing cloud to anticipate

218
00:15:26,044 --> 00:15:27,964
customer needs and anticipation.

219
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,684
Also, it becomes more and
more important, going forward.

220
00:15:32,314 --> 00:15:35,614
let's start with key highlights,
personalized marketing.

221
00:15:35,654 --> 00:15:36,504
So they target.

222
00:15:37,164 --> 00:15:41,044
target leverages, cloud based
analytics to process customer

223
00:15:41,044 --> 00:15:43,504
data and create talent promotions.

224
00:15:44,214 --> 00:15:47,914
They also, do very precise
product recommendation using

225
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:50,164
cloud algorithm algorithms.

226
00:15:50,174 --> 00:15:53,454
So it's a, let's call it an
advanced personalization.

227
00:15:54,014 --> 00:15:58,334
Of course, inventory is optimized
using the, cloud capabilities.

228
00:15:58,974 --> 00:16:04,324
And cloud analyzes customer behavior,
which is also very important for

229
00:16:04,324 --> 00:16:07,394
tailoring and anticipating the offers.

230
00:16:08,214 --> 00:16:11,244
And of course the dynamic
pricing, because they work in a

231
00:16:11,244 --> 00:16:13,464
very, competitive environment.

232
00:16:13,914 --> 00:16:18,904
And adjusting pricing in real time
based on the cloud analytics is of

233
00:16:18,994 --> 00:16:24,164
paramount importance for them Next
is an example of starbucks rewards.

234
00:16:24,164 --> 00:16:30,204
So they are definitely mobile centric
And they are definitely instant and

235
00:16:30,224 --> 00:16:36,694
so very personal real time updates So
the rewards and offers are instantly

236
00:16:36,694 --> 00:16:42,934
synchronized across all platforms whether
it's In store, app, online, everything

237
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:44,624
is in sync based on your profile.

238
00:16:45,124 --> 00:16:49,034
Personalization based on cloud
analytics deliver tailored promotions

239
00:16:49,064 --> 00:16:51,804
based on your personal preferences.

240
00:16:52,254 --> 00:16:56,364
And of course it drives up
customer satisfaction and loyalty.

241
00:16:56,864 --> 00:17:03,494
Scalability, so millions of transactions
are handled smoothly and resources

242
00:17:03,494 --> 00:17:05,384
scale automatically during peak times.

243
00:17:05,884 --> 00:17:06,984
Omni channel integration.

244
00:17:07,004 --> 00:17:12,434
Again, we will see it today multiple
times, the omni channel integration.

245
00:17:12,904 --> 00:17:18,404
Rewards, seamlessly integrated across
the app, website, stores, and you

246
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,584
can flexibly redeem these rewards.

247
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:22,404
And innovation.

248
00:17:22,414 --> 00:17:28,124
So basically, if you have a new feature to
roll out, you can do that very quickly and

249
00:17:28,224 --> 00:17:31,144
with, protection of customer data in mind.

250
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:34,164
Let's now switch to
cloud integration today.

251
00:17:34,664 --> 00:17:40,874
and I think that Microsoft Azure's retail
solution is a great example of how it's

252
00:17:41,314 --> 00:17:46,184
working and helping, businesses today
because Scalable infrastructure and

253
00:17:46,184 --> 00:17:50,874
advanced analytic tools is something
that retail really needs these

254
00:17:50,874 --> 00:17:55,619
days Scalable cloud infrastructure,
when Azure automatically scales

255
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:57,589
computing resources based on demand.

256
00:17:58,189 --> 00:18:02,259
And again, for retailers, it's
someone else's computer resources.

257
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:05,649
So you don't have to build data
set, a data center yourself

258
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:09,779
to analyze personalization,
run your CRM stuff, et cetera.

259
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:12,879
Advanced analytics and insights.

260
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:16,809
And that's also very important
because it's large data

261
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:20,759
volumes and having a swift.

262
00:18:21,144 --> 00:18:25,724
Access to it, to having insights
on customer behavior, sales trends,

263
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:28,024
forecasts, pricing is very important.

264
00:18:28,944 --> 00:18:34,194
Then personalized customer experience,
because Azure's AI deliver personalized

265
00:18:34,194 --> 00:18:36,194
recommendations and tailored promotions.

266
00:18:36,894 --> 00:18:38,794
Enhanced security and compliance.

267
00:18:39,234 --> 00:18:43,229
Again, GDPR, so everything is
there and very secure with Azure.

268
00:18:43,729 --> 00:18:46,459
and operational efficiency
and cost savings.

269
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:50,219
Infrastructure as a service
migrating to Azure reduces

270
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:52,549
capital expenditure on hardware.

271
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,429
As I said, you don't have to build
all those servers yourself to

272
00:18:58,159 --> 00:18:59,789
improve your customer experience.

273
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:05,729
Then my next example, is related to AI
and cloud powered customer assistance.

274
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:09,549
And I think H& M virtual
assistant is just brilliant here.

275
00:19:10,109 --> 00:19:15,509
So interactive AI customer
supports 24 seven, and it responds

276
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:17,789
to you in a natural language.

277
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:22,459
We all remember, and I guess we all
don't much like those chat bots.

278
00:19:22,469 --> 00:19:26,859
We often hear when we call to
our bank or to our retailer.

279
00:19:26,889 --> 00:19:28,599
So H& M is not the case.

280
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:32,809
Their chatbot is answering
naturally and that's called

281
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:35,439
natural language processing or NLP.

282
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:40,129
So that's a technology A cloud technology
that is very important going forward.

283
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,009
Personalized product recommendation.

284
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:46,809
Analyzing customer behavior and
preference stored in the cloud.

285
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:50,569
Virtual Assistant offers
personalized recommendation with,

286
00:19:50,849 --> 00:19:52,399
aligned with individual style.

287
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:57,179
Efficient product search
with AI interpreting intent

288
00:19:57,219 --> 00:19:58,799
to deliver accurate results.

289
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,629
So that's also very important.

290
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:01,919
AI Assistant based.

291
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:05,299
Scalable and reliable
cloud infrastructure.

292
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,889
Scalability is very important,
especially for the large retailers

293
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:12,709
like H& M and Seamless Omnichannel.

294
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:18,589
So today it's, Omnichannel, we've been
hearing this for multiple times because

295
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:23,239
this is of paramount importance the
way your app, your social media, your

296
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:28,769
assistant, your web, your offline store
is integrated in one seamless experience.

297
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:34,449
Now, let's have a look at the future
of cloud integration, and I think

298
00:20:34,469 --> 00:20:39,039
Stitch Fix, AI recommendations is a
great example here for personalized

299
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:41,039
fashion suggestions from AI.

300
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:45,899
Every time we deal with fashion,
it's, it gets complicated

301
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:47,259
because fashion is personal.

302
00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:48,149
Fashion is something.

303
00:20:48,689 --> 00:20:55,539
Tailored only to you and data driven
personalization that StageFix provides

304
00:20:55,959 --> 00:21:03,189
is really revolutionize this industry in
terms of collecting feedback preferences,

305
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:07,249
processing them in the cloud and then
understanding your personal unique

306
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:12,259
style, giving your, you, giving you
the unique, offers and suggestions.

307
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:19,299
Machine learning and algorithms,
offstage fix predict, basically fashion

308
00:21:19,339 --> 00:21:23,989
items that clients are likely to take
based on your experience in the past.

309
00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:29,679
Hybrid human AI styling, is AI
generated suggestions, basically

310
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:32,619
curated by humans with human judgment.

311
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:37,319
So basically ensuring that a tailored
experience, delivered to you,

312
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:41,239
based on AI plus human suggestions.

313
00:21:41,739 --> 00:21:46,819
Then again, it's scalable cloud
infrastructure because the demand for

314
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:53,749
analytics and for data, became, becomes,
bigger and optimizing the inventory

315
00:21:53,749 --> 00:21:59,059
manage, management, which also helps
drive up, customer satisfaction when.

316
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:04,019
Everything is available, everything
is planned, and the inventory

317
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:06,119
is there when customer needs it.

318
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:11,519
And Macy's example, so how Internet
of Things inventory tracking and

319
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:16,529
targeted advertising based on the
cloud is driving, their retail forward.

320
00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:21,859
So first of all, it's real time inventory
tracking and they basically equip,

321
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:26,909
their shelves with RFIDs, technology
to monitor merchandise in real time.

322
00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:32,069
It's also automated replenishment that
smart shelves that they have detect

323
00:22:32,229 --> 00:22:37,939
low inventory and instantly notify,
store associates, for restocking.

324
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:42,249
Personalized in store marketing
Macy installs Bluetooth beacons.

325
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:46,519
to interact with the shopper's
smartphones via the application.

326
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,849
Of course, everything is with consent.

327
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:54,839
Enhanced customer engagement, because
beacons provide real time information, and

328
00:22:54,869 --> 00:23:01,829
in retail, it's very important to be up
to speed, to be real time, because that

329
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:04,469
provides a much more engaging experience.

330
00:23:05,389 --> 00:23:10,469
And data driven store optimization, data
collected from smart shelves and beacons

331
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:13,379
allow Macy's to analyze shopping patterns.

332
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,359
and product interactions.

333
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:19,909
Alibaba's new retail initiative
example, I think it's, we all know

334
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:22,319
Alibaba, it's a massive retailer.

335
00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:27,859
they are well known for innovations
for blending, online and offline

336
00:23:27,889 --> 00:23:30,259
and for developing online element.

337
00:23:30,879 --> 00:23:36,379
So blending online and offline, commerce
using cloud is what Alibaba is doing as

338
00:23:36,439 --> 00:23:38,459
part of their new retail initiatives.

339
00:23:39,009 --> 00:23:41,799
first of all, it's unified
commerce ecosystem.

340
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:46,359
So they use cloud to integrate e
commerce platform, physical store and

341
00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:48,109
create seamless retail environment.

342
00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:51,819
It's data driven personalization
based on cloud analytics.

343
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:56,079
So all the customer behaviors and
preferences are being collected

344
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:57,619
and carefully understood.

345
00:23:57,999 --> 00:24:02,799
So they get, customers can get
personalized offers, smart stores,

346
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:05,089
and internet of things integration.

347
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:10,199
They now launched what they call a
hammer fresh stores and internet of

348
00:24:10,209 --> 00:24:16,049
things allowed them to in real time,
analyze and manage inventory and

349
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:18,499
provide interactive shopping experience.

350
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,839
Optimize supply chain and logistics.

351
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:22,229
Again, cloud based system.

352
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:25,459
Enable real time inventory
tracking and efficient fulfillment.

353
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:30,999
And enhanced mobile integration, where
mobile apps like Taobao or Alipay are

354
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,069
integrated with the physical retail.

355
00:24:33,569 --> 00:24:35,419
Now, almost there.

356
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:37,059
Thanks for being with me.

357
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:37,869
Almost there.

358
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:39,769
Key takeaways and conclusion.

359
00:24:40,269 --> 00:24:41,309
For me, it's very simple.

360
00:24:41,329 --> 00:24:44,289
Retailer is either in the
cloud or out of business.

361
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,479
There is no other way.

362
00:24:46,669 --> 00:24:53,059
So you either evolve and use all the
goodness, the AI, the cloud computing,

363
00:24:53,089 --> 00:24:54,599
Internet of Things that we have.

364
00:24:55,099 --> 00:25:01,864
Or you just will lose your customer who
will look for the right Cloud experience

365
00:25:01,884 --> 00:25:07,904
somewhere else and key takeaways can
be summarized to five simple things.

366
00:25:07,954 --> 00:25:11,284
First of all, we go to physical
store only if we want to.

367
00:25:11,784 --> 00:25:16,274
Second, retail, retailer only as
good as it's online and mobile.

368
00:25:16,554 --> 00:25:17,734
I think it's very important.

369
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:23,764
So you have to make sure that
your, online, store, your

370
00:25:23,764 --> 00:25:25,414
mobile application is flawless.

371
00:25:26,054 --> 00:25:29,174
Omni channel integration
defines customer experience.

372
00:25:29,174 --> 00:25:31,024
And that's so true for today.

373
00:25:31,524 --> 00:25:36,774
Predictive personalization is
imperative and AI is part of sales from

374
00:25:36,774 --> 00:25:39,754
recommendation to support going forward.

375
00:25:40,254 --> 00:25:41,024
So that's it.

376
00:25:41,324 --> 00:25:43,214
Thanks for, being with me.

377
00:25:43,224 --> 00:25:44,464
Thanks for having me.

378
00:25:44,774 --> 00:25:48,864

presentation and the case studies.
