1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,120
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:05,080
My name is Shubham Gupta,
and I am an analytics and AI

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,140
leader at Noblesoft Solutions.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,770
First of all, I would like to thank
Conf42 for inviting me as a speaker

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,930
for Cloud Native 2025 conference.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,110
I'm very excited to talk about
my topic, which is agentic AI

7
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:25,909
and blockchain autonomous systems
for next generation innovations.

8
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:27,709
So folks, let's dive in.

9
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:37,460
I will begin my presentation by,
referring to some key points from

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,430
Sam Altman's, three observations.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,250
Sam Altman is the CEO of OpenAI, the
company responsible for creating ChatGPT.

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,040
So he says that AI intelligence
scales with resources.

13
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:58,190
So the more computing power, the
more data and the more inference you

14
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,940
provide to AI systems, the smarter
and more intelligent they become.

15
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,950
Another key point.

16
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:12,530
is that the cost of AI drops by a
factor of 10 every year, which means

17
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:19,210
that AI is becoming cheaper and also
getting commoditized and is no longer

18
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:23,840
accessible only to big tech companies
as it was happening a few years ago.

19
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,830
So what this means for
2025 and beyond, right?

20
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:37,495
So AI is no longer playing a passive role
in the decision making process, but it

21
00:01:37,495 --> 00:01:43,945
is slowly becoming a virtual co worker
who can actively collaborate with you.

22
00:01:44,555 --> 00:01:49,365
And we are already seeing this disruption
in software engineering already.

23
00:01:49,865 --> 00:01:52,300
Now, what is agentic AI?

24
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:57,710
agentic AI refers to autonomous
software agents capable of decision

25
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,710
making with minimal human intervention.

26
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:06,120
These agents do not merely react,
but they proactively execute

27
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,160
strategies to solve complex tasks.

28
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,920
what is agentic AI again, right?

29
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,000
agentic AI is the future
of autonomous intelligence.

30
00:02:17,845 --> 00:02:25,405
Now, as you can see in the diagram,
it has six key components, context

31
00:02:25,405 --> 00:02:31,154
awareness, goal setting, processing,
decision making, ethics and

32
00:02:31,155 --> 00:02:33,745
governance, and then autonomous action.

33
00:02:34,115 --> 00:02:37,235
Autonomous action is a very
important word here, right?

34
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:44,355
these AI agents operate on the core
principle of autonomous operation,

35
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:49,355
goal driven behavior, context
awareness, and self improvement.

36
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:56,285
They feature an autonomy engine
that enables self initiated

37
00:02:56,285 --> 00:02:58,645
actions and resource management.

38
00:02:59,225 --> 00:03:03,065
these AI agents use adaptive learning.

39
00:03:03,525 --> 00:03:07,105
to continuously evolve
through reinforcement learning

40
00:03:07,275 --> 00:03:08,715
and pattern recognition.

41
00:03:09,215 --> 00:03:13,995
It incorporates a decision matrix
for real time risk assessment

42
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:15,974
and scenario simulation.

43
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:21,455
It maintains ethical boundaries
through a dedicated governance layer.

44
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:26,935
It integrates with other AI agents,
through a collaborative ecosystem.

45
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,070
It also represents the next
evolution in AI, which is moving from

46
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,780
reactive to proactive intelligence.

47
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,670
here is the day to day
use case of, AI agents.

48
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:46,179
AI agents can proactively
take actions here.

49
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:50,769
They can post, the content on
different social media platforms.

50
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:56,330
They can decide what to post,
when to post, where to post,

51
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:02,989
how to post, so that you can get
maximum engagement on your content.

52
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:09,359
So you can see that, these AI agents
are proactively making decisions.

53
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:15,829
so now let's learn a little
bit about AI agents, right?

54
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,329
So they have six core components.

55
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:22,179
The number one is learning system.

56
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:31,840
so these AI agents build comprehensive
knowledge base and then it adapts

57
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,760
its learning method continuously.

58
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,250
Then comes goal framework.

59
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,920
So the framework sets
very clear objectives.

60
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,770
It takes progress against these.

61
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:51,965
targets or objectives, and it
ensures that alignment happens

62
00:04:52,075 --> 00:04:54,695
with those intended goals.

63
00:04:55,175 --> 00:04:57,195
Then comes reasoning engine.

64
00:04:57,604 --> 00:05:01,454
reasoning engine processes
complex logical operations.

65
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:06,484
Um, it makes decisions
based on available data.

66
00:05:06,754 --> 00:05:09,034
It solves problems through
systematic analysis.

67
00:05:09,714 --> 00:05:11,944
It maintains consistency in logical flows.

68
00:05:12,374 --> 00:05:13,924
Then comes memory system.

69
00:05:14,174 --> 00:05:17,704
So the memory system manages
short term information storage.

70
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:20,474
It maintains long term
knowledge retention.

71
00:05:20,674 --> 00:05:23,424
It handles efficient
information retrieval.

72
00:05:23,804 --> 00:05:26,774
It integrates various
memory types seamlessly.

73
00:05:27,214 --> 00:05:29,374
Then comes interaction layer.

74
00:05:30,114 --> 00:05:33,594
this layer manages
communication interfaces.

75
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,784
It processes API requests.

76
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:38,404
It generates appropriate responses.

77
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:44,399
and then finally, we have
safety protocol, this protocol

78
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:47,349
implements ethical frameworks.

79
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:54,219
It enforces, constraint systems,
validate actions and outputs, and it

80
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:57,219
also ensures safe operation boundaries.

81
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:02,949
Now, let's dive into the
agentic AI architecture.

82
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,029
in this architecture, we
have six key steps again.

83
00:06:08,809 --> 00:06:10,699
Number one is learning.

84
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,919
Then comes adoption.

85
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:14,879
Then comes action.

86
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,009
Then comes anticipation.

87
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:19,979
Then we have efficiency.

88
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:21,369
And then refinement.

89
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:27,669
learning, like we discussed,
it constantly ingests new data.

90
00:06:28,299 --> 00:06:31,239
and it's training itself continuously.

91
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,319
dynamically updating its knowledge base.

92
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:37,779
When it comes to adoption,
the architecture implements

93
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:39,639
continuous feedback loops.

94
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:45,029
When it comes to actions, the system
demonstrates initiative and task

95
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:51,469
execution, generating strategic responses
to the challenges, and capitalizing on

96
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:53,879
the opportunities when detected, right?

97
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:56,369
Then comes anticipation.

98
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:02,799
So through forecasting capabilities, risk
assessment protocols, and trend analysis,

99
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:09,699
The system stays ahead of emerging
patterns and potential challenges.

100
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,829
Then comes efficiency.

101
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:17,719
So the architecture maintains peak
performances through optimization of

102
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:22,849
processes, smart resource allocation,
and continuous performance tuning.

103
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:25,509
And then finally we have refinement.

104
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:30,999
So the system ensures excellence,
operational excellence through

105
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:35,859
continuous improvement cycles,
dynamic adjustment capabilities,

106
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,219
and rigorous quality assurances.

107
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:43,939
Now, let's see how these
AI agents work, right?

108
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:46,839
So it starts with input processing.

109
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:52,179
So the system processes natural
language inputs from users.

110
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:55,619
It also interfaces with
the external system.

111
00:07:56,094 --> 00:08:01,024
through API request, then we
have knowledge based integration,

112
00:08:01,384 --> 00:08:06,824
where these agents step into
comprehensive domain knowledge.

113
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:12,364
it understands user specific
context for personalization.

114
00:08:12,684 --> 00:08:14,584
Then comes task planning.

115
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:18,584
So the agent analyzes
specific goals to achieve.

116
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:21,684
It breaks down complex
tasks into sequential steps.

117
00:08:22,564 --> 00:08:28,994
Is it then efficiently allocates available
resources and then it says task priorities

118
00:08:29,294 --> 00:08:33,334
based on importance and urgency, right?

119
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:36,174
then comes reasoning engine, right?

120
00:08:36,174 --> 00:08:41,314
So the system applies logical
inferences to draw conclusions.

121
00:08:42,024 --> 00:08:45,394
It identifies patterns
and complex data sets.

122
00:08:45,894 --> 00:08:47,914
Then comes tool integration.

123
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:54,234
So the agent connects with
external tools through APIs.

124
00:08:54,754 --> 00:08:58,034
It processes data using
specialized processors.

125
00:08:58,374 --> 00:09:03,424
It leverages external services
for enhanced capabilities.

126
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:06,854
It executes custom functions
for a specific task.

127
00:09:07,474 --> 00:09:10,114
Then comes, execution engine, right?

128
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:16,364
So the, System org, is designed to
handle multiple tasks simultaneously.

129
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:20,804
It handles errors with fallback options.

130
00:09:20,874 --> 00:09:23,454
It maintains state across operations.

131
00:09:23,574 --> 00:09:26,284
It validates results for accuracy.

132
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,904
Then comes response generation.

133
00:09:29,074 --> 00:09:32,994
the agents select
optimal, response formats.

134
00:09:33,064 --> 00:09:34,554
It ensures quality.

135
00:09:34,564 --> 00:09:36,694
It determines the best delivery methods.

136
00:09:37,194 --> 00:09:40,834
And then it incorporates user
feedback for improvements.

137
00:09:41,534 --> 00:09:44,044
Then comes system monitoring.

138
00:09:44,434 --> 00:09:47,924
So the agent takes key
performance metrics.

139
00:09:47,994 --> 00:09:50,544
It monitors for potential errors.

140
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:53,324
It analyzes users usage patterns.

141
00:09:53,824 --> 00:09:56,854
It maintains system health checks.

142
00:09:57,739 --> 00:10:00,989
And then finally, we have security layer.

143
00:10:01,499 --> 00:10:04,449
so here, system verifies
user authentication.

144
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:07,199
It manages authorization levels.

145
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:09,769
It ensures data privacy compliance.

146
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:13,569
And it also maintains detailed audit logs.

147
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:20,119
Now, here is another way to
explain how AI agent works, right?

148
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:21,749
we have input sources.

149
00:10:22,349 --> 00:10:27,469
So the system ingests data
through three primary channels.

150
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:31,649
number one is knowledge based
integration for foundational information.

151
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:35,029
Number two is user queries
for direct interaction.

152
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:39,909
And number three is API calls for
external system communication.

153
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:46,409
So then each input stream feeds into
the central processing pipeline,

154
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:49,189
which is AI processing pipeline.

155
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:56,824
So now In this stage or in this layer,
the agent processes incoming information

156
00:10:56,854 --> 00:10:59,554
through sophisticated analysis systems.

157
00:11:00,074 --> 00:11:05,984
It parses natural language,
structures data formats, and

158
00:11:06,054 --> 00:11:09,334
prepares input for deeper processing.

159
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:11,584
Then comes, reasoning layer.

160
00:11:11,914 --> 00:11:17,054
So the cognitive core applies
advanced reasoning capabilities.

161
00:11:17,499 --> 00:11:18,729
to the analyzed data.

162
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:25,529
It synthesizes information from multiple
sources, identifies patterns, formulates

163
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:31,899
logical pathways to solution, and this
forms the basis for decision making.

164
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:38,959
And then finally, you have,
decision making, which is, The

165
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:43,419
agent evaluates possible actions
based on process information.

166
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:47,639
It weighs alternatives,
consider constraints, and

167
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,619
selects optimal approaches.

168
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:57,819
This ensures that the response aligns with
the user needs and system capabilities.

169
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:00,509
Then comes, task execution.

170
00:12:01,099 --> 00:12:05,809
Here, the system implements chosen
actions through its It's execution

171
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:10,279
engine, it manages resource
allocation, handles concurrent

172
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:15,249
operations, and maintains operational
consistency throughout the process.

173
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,889
Then comes agent collaboration.

174
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:28,279
So multiple AI agent systems work in
concert to achieve, complex goals.

175
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:31,169
They share information,
coordinate actions.

176
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:36,679
and leverage collective capabilities
for enhanced problem solving.

177
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:39,139
Then come response generation.

178
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:44,409
So the final output synthesizes
results from all previous stages.

179
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:51,529
It then formats responses appropriately,
ensures clarity and accuracy, and

180
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:56,159
delivers information to the optimal
channel for user confirmation.

181
00:12:56,659 --> 00:13:00,599
So now let's talk about the
difference between AI automation,

182
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:05,049
AI workflows, and AI agents, right?

183
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:14,189
So AI automation, as we have been seeing
in the past, it just executes predefined

184
00:13:14,189 --> 00:13:17,049
scripts with some fixed rules, right?

185
00:13:17,489 --> 00:13:22,219
So Zapier email integration
could be an example for this.

186
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,919
Then comes AI workflows.

187
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:30,979
These workflows manages complex
processes with defined decision points.

188
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:36,419
So a good example here could be
Netflix recommendation system.

189
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:39,099
And then finally comes AI agents.

190
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:44,489
these agents create autonomous
solutions through intelligent reasoning.

191
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:51,249
One example of this could be
automated inventory management

192
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,069
and supply chain management.

193
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:56,569
And we will go over this,
example a little bit later.

194
00:13:57,409 --> 00:14:03,080
So now, after going over, AI
agents, now let's dive into

195
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:05,289
the blockchain fundamentals.

196
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:10,010
So a blockchain is a distributed
e routable ledger that records

197
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:14,890
transactions across multiple
nodes in a peer to peer network.

198
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:20,010
Now, what is the benefit of
using a blockchain, right?

199
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:24,869
So the main benefits are
decentralization, meaning the

200
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,350
information is not centrally stored.

201
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,100
It is scattered across
several different nodes.

202
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,240
Data, once recorded, cannot be changed.

203
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:42,200
the system is transparent, meaning
everyone, accessing the data.

204
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,130
sees the same information and
it's safe and secure because

205
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:53,020
of, consensus mechanisms, right?

206
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,330
again, why blockchain, right?

207
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,860
it removes single point of failure,
it ensures data integrity and

208
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:06,810
transparency, it enables trustless
environments, and then it facilitates,

209
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,810
secure peer to peer transactions.

210
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:18,520
And the key strengths of blockchain,
namely decentralization and immutable

211
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:27,540
record keeping are very important when
data must be verifiable and tamper proof

212
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,919
across multiple stakeholders, right?

213
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:35,540
so here is a blockchain
architecture, right?

214
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,750
here we can see that there are
different types of blockchains.

215
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,720
We have consortium blockchains,
we have public blockchains, and

216
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,130
then we have private blockchains.

217
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:51,290
These blockchains use
different consensus mechanisms.

218
00:15:52,115 --> 00:15:57,955
when they need to add a new
block in the blockchain, right?

219
00:15:58,355 --> 00:16:03,845
So it can either be proof of work
or it could be proof of a stake.

220
00:16:04,315 --> 00:16:08,905
Now, we have gone through AI agents.

221
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:12,665
We have, understanding about blockchain.

222
00:16:13,385 --> 00:16:19,535
So now let's see why we should combine
AI and blockchain together, right?

223
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:26,990
So AI and blockchain can work
together, very well to achieve

224
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:31,090
autonomous innovation, which is
where the future is heading, right?

225
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,530
first of all, data integration for AI.

226
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,020
So AI models often rely
on very large data sets.

227
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:46,775
So blockchain here ensures
data accuracy, data quality,

228
00:16:46,825 --> 00:16:53,145
authenticity, which actually, make
these AI models more reliable.

229
00:16:53,715 --> 00:16:56,295
Then comes autonomous agent coordination.

230
00:16:56,305 --> 00:17:03,595
So for example, for complex tasks, we
might have many decentralized agents.

231
00:17:04,095 --> 00:17:09,355
that needs to coordinate with each
other, without a central authority.

232
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:16,765
So in this case, combining AI and
blockchain can work very well.

233
00:17:17,515 --> 00:17:21,025
then come smart contracts
for decision enforcement.

234
00:17:21,025 --> 00:17:28,285
So agentic AI decisions can be executed
automatically via smart contracts.

235
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:32,430
Thereby reducing the
chance of fraud, right?

236
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,330
And then come auditability
of AI decisions.

237
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,930
So immutable records of decisions
made by AI agents can be stored on

238
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,710
the blockchain for future auditing.

239
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:54,580
so all these, characteristics make
this combination a really good

240
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,190
combination for autonomous innovation.

241
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:02,430
So here we can see that, AI.

242
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:09,100
is provided with extensively real
world data, which it uses to generate

243
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:16,370
insights, and then it triggers on chain
transactions, through smart contracts.

244
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:21,540
Then these smart contracts, record the
transactions on the blockchain, making

245
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,240
them available to all stakeholders, right?

246
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:29,660
here we can see that once the transactions
are recorded onto the blockchain, all

247
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:37,070
stakeholders access the same information
no matter where they are situated.

248
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:42,690
so now let's see some important
use cases of, AI and blockchain

249
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,880
innovation together, right?

250
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:50,640
So it can very well be used in supply
chain management where AI agents

251
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,090
optimize logistics and blockchain
provides, immutable record keeping.

252
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:02,190
Then we can use AI agents and blockchain
combo and decentralized finance.

253
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:09,090
We can use them in healthcare data
sharing and then energy grid optimization.

254
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:16,500
Now, as I mentioned before, let's
go over the AI and blockchain

255
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,810
and supply chain management.

256
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,670
So enterprise systems and IoT
sensors generate data, which

257
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,110
is then fed into the AI engine.

258
00:19:27,575 --> 00:19:31,335
or AI agents to generate
insights and alerts.

259
00:19:31,675 --> 00:19:37,855
Now, based on these insights, a smart
contract is triggered to record payment on

260
00:19:37,915 --> 00:19:45,065
the blockchain, ensuring all stakeholders
have access to the same real time data.

261
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:49,285
now in this case, you can see we
have manufacturers, suppliers,

262
00:19:49,305 --> 00:19:53,075
retailers, and then we have transport
providers, then we have warehouse.

263
00:19:53,665 --> 00:20:00,055
So all of them are accessing
the same copy of data, which is

264
00:20:00,055 --> 00:20:02,235
coming from blockchain ledger.

265
00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:04,605
and it is the source of
truth for everyone here.

266
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:13,345
Now, when it comes to feature outlook,
we can use, AI and blockchain in

267
00:20:14,075 --> 00:20:18,325
AI use case, where AI competition
happens very close to the.

268
00:20:18,735 --> 00:20:26,515
Source of data, it can help in federated
learning where AI runs on multiple

269
00:20:26,675 --> 00:20:30,615
devices without exposing sensitive data.

270
00:20:31,115 --> 00:20:35,855
Now, AI innovations, what is
the road ahead for us, right?

271
00:20:36,395 --> 00:20:38,585
So by 2035.

272
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:44,650
one person may have access to the
intellectual capacity of an entire 2025.

273
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:45,860
This is crazy, right?

274
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,610
and then new form of work will emerge.

275
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,860
very different from today's job.

276
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:57,140
So it will transition from knowledge based
economy to an allocation based economy.

277
00:20:58,055 --> 00:21:05,555
AI will be integrated into everything and
then smart will become the new default.

278
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:11,405
So with these pointers in mind, I
would like to conclude my session.

279
00:21:11,505 --> 00:21:16,445
I would like to thank all of you
for listening to my presentation

280
00:21:17,145 --> 00:21:19,075
and I wish you a good day.

281
00:21:19,325 --> 00:21:19,835
Thank you.
