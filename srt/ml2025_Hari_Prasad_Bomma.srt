Thanks for joining this session.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,610
I'm here to talk about reshaping the
very foundation of retail artificial

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,700
intelligence for store assistance as a
senior data engineer and architect with

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,185
over 18 years of experience in this field.

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:30,150
I've seen how data algorithms and smart
systems are transforming businesses.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,830
AI doesn't just support backend analytics.

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,810
It becomes a frontline tool for
engaging customers, optimizing

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,775
operations, and driving strategic
decision making decision.

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,870
Today's session is designed
to unpack this transformation.

11
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:55,425
I will guide you through how AI and
machine learning are integrated into

12
00:00:55,425 --> 00:01:01,995
retail environments, both online and
in physical stores, and how these

13
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:07,695
technologies are helping businesses
to meet modern consumer expectations.

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,775
This is not, it's.

15
00:01:14,235 --> 00:01:19,485
It is about using data and intelligence
to craft better, more efficient,

16
00:01:19,634 --> 00:01:22,155
and more personal shopping journeys.

17
00:01:23,205 --> 00:01:28,574
Whether you are a tech guy or a retail
executive, or simply curious to know

18
00:01:28,994 --> 00:01:34,869
about how AI is impacting in retail
stores, this session will help you.

19
00:01:36,089 --> 00:01:38,759
To walk away with some
valuable insights today.

20
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:44,550
Let's dive in and explore what the
future of smart retail really looks like.

21
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,310
Here is what we'll
cover over this session.

22
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,259
First, I'll give a quick
introduction to the state of AI in

23
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,539
retail to provide context to it.

24
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:04,380
Then we'll see some statistics about
growth and investment in the space.

25
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,829
We'll see some specific applications like
virtual try ons, cashier list checkouts,

26
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,040
and AI powered restocking systems.

27
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:20,820
Then we'll dive into future trends,
especially hyper-personalization, dynamic

28
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:26,190
pricing and digitalization of and stores.

29
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,710
From there, we'll go deep into
core applications of AI in.

30
00:02:33,105 --> 00:02:37,575
Inventory management, chat bots,
recommendation systems, and more.

31
00:02:38,415 --> 00:02:43,635
We'll learn about ML models and
tools empowering these applications.

32
00:02:45,105 --> 00:02:49,244
Next, we'll break down the most
important frameworks and technologies.

33
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,625
TensorFlow, PyTorch, Azure, ai, and Maker.

34
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:54,529
Then we.

35
00:03:02,325 --> 00:03:08,924
We'll also cover a real case study to make
things tangible and show how it benefits.

36
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:12,465
Let's begin with the big picture

37
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:19,845
is undergoing a profound transformation
and AI at the heart of it.

38
00:03:20,864 --> 00:03:29,114
In just the past five years, we have seen
become far more digital and automated.

39
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:37,530
AI and retail is projected to
grow from 26.9 billion in 2023

40
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,770
to over 60 billion by 2030.

41
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,329
That's a compound annual
growth rate of 31 percentage.

42
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,280
This is not marginal.

43
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:49,260
It's exceptional growth.

44
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:49,769
Why?

45
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:55,655
Because AI addresses two core challenges
in retail efficiency and personal.

46
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,540
Customers expect more faster service.

47
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,020
Personalized offers, seamless experiences.

48
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:09,480
At the same time, businesses face
pressure to reduce operational cost and

49
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,790
make smarter decisions in real time.

50
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,260
AI is uniquely positioned to
solve both the challenges.

51
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,415
Think about your last shopping experience.

52
00:04:20,035 --> 00:04:20,575
Did you get.

53
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,910
Did HR Port assisted you?

54
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,940
Was your checkout fast and personalized?

55
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,070
If so, there is a good chance AI
played a role behind the scenes.

56
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,940
Retailers are using AI for dynamic
inventory management, ensuring shelves

57
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:47,430
are stocked, not just based on past
data, but on predictive insights.

58
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,105
They using it.

59
00:04:53,414 --> 00:04:59,565
Demand spikes based on weather or
local events, or even to create

60
00:04:59,804 --> 00:05:03,854
hyper-personalized promotions
based on processing behavior.

61
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:10,005
As we continue, I'll show you how
different types of ai, national language

62
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:14,924
processing, computer vision, predictive
analytics, are coming together to

63
00:05:14,924 --> 00:05:20,025
create intelligent, responsive and
customer first retail ecosystems.

64
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:28,035
Many still rely on manual processes, gut
failing or outdated systems, but the raise

65
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:33,645
of cloud AI platforms and pre-trained
models, even small businesses, can

66
00:05:33,645 --> 00:05:39,225
implement chatbots, customer segmentation
models, or pricing optimization tools

67
00:05:39,855 --> 00:05:42,135
with minimal cost and high returns.

68
00:05:44,985 --> 00:05:51,315
The future of AI in retail is incredibly
exciting and can be summarized in three

69
00:05:51,315 --> 00:05:56,565
key trends, hyper-personalization,
real-time dynamic pricing, and

70
00:05:56,985 --> 00:05:59,145
AI optimized physical stores.

71
00:05:59,895 --> 00:06:02,150
Let's start with hyper-personalization.

72
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:08,510
This goes beyond showing how you
products based on your browsing history.

73
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:14,445
It's about using data from multiple
touch points, social media, purchase

74
00:06:14,445 --> 00:06:20,955
history, realtime location, even biometric
signals to create a tailored experience.

75
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:26,145
Imagine walking into your store where
screen welcomes you by name and offers

76
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,400
deals based on your preferences.

77
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,120
That's where we.

78
00:06:31,485 --> 00:06:33,735
Second real time dynamic pricing.

79
00:06:34,605 --> 00:06:39,585
A models can now adjust prices
based on current inventory,

80
00:06:39,885 --> 00:06:45,075
competitive pricing, market demand,
and even better, or even data.

81
00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:48,285
Airlines and hotels have
used this for years.

82
00:06:49,155 --> 00:06:50,775
Now it's coming to retail.

83
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,560
For instance, a grocery store
can rise or lower the prices

84
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:00,300
based on protect expiration
timelines or foot traffic trends.

85
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:03,690
Maximizing profits while minimizing waste.

86
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,940
Third brick and motor
optimization four years.

87
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,870
Physical stores have lacked
behind e-commerce in innovation,

88
00:07:13,245 --> 00:07:14,585
but that's changing fast.

89
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:20,775
We now have AI power systems for
tech prevention, footfall analytics,

90
00:07:20,895 --> 00:07:26,625
and automated checkouts stores can
analyze in-store movement patterns

91
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:31,875
to improve shelf layouts, deploy
virtual mirrors, or use computer

92
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:35,085
vision to track them interactions and.

93
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,469
Takeaway here is that AI is no longer
just enhancing what we do in retail.

94
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,710
It's redefining how we do it.

95
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:51,599
It's creating new standard
where convenience, speed, and

96
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,789
personalization are no longer pers.

97
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,250
They are expectations.

98
00:07:58,049 --> 00:08:04,710
Let's talk about how are
reshaping operations.

99
00:08:06,435 --> 00:08:10,724
And perhaps most impactful
area is inventory management.

100
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:16,604
Traditional stock control is reactive
and manual, but with ai, stores

101
00:08:16,604 --> 00:08:22,755
now predict buying trends weeks in
advance, algorithm analysis, past

102
00:08:22,755 --> 00:08:28,065
sales, seasonal patterns, and even
events like holidays, weather forecast.

103
00:08:28,395 --> 00:08:32,325
This predictive approach not
only awards stock orders, but

104
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:37,515
also minimizes overstock, which
saves money and reduces waste.

105
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:43,215
Next is demand forecasting by
leveraging machine learning models.

106
00:08:43,545 --> 00:08:48,615
Often time series based retailers
can fine tune recruitment

107
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:50,940
schedules, for example, a.

108
00:08:52,995 --> 00:08:58,964
Stock more raincoats in advance of we
season predicted by AI models trained

109
00:08:58,964 --> 00:09:01,665
on historical and meteorological data.

110
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:05,775
Then we have personalized
product recommendations.

111
00:09:06,135 --> 00:09:09,750
This is one of the most visible
AI applications to customers.

112
00:09:10,665 --> 00:09:13,574
Think about streaming our
online video companies.

113
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:16,185
You see solutions tailored just for you.

114
00:09:16,814 --> 00:09:21,555
Retailers are now doing the same, whether
it's suggesting a new skincare product

115
00:09:21,615 --> 00:09:26,564
based on the previous purchase or bundling
offers according to buying behavior.

116
00:09:27,225 --> 00:09:30,944
These algorithms drive both
customer satisfaction and

117
00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:32,685
higher revenue per transaction.

118
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:34,040
One of.

119
00:09:36,435 --> 00:09:39,225
Is chatbots and virtual assistance.

120
00:09:39,735 --> 00:09:43,814
These are not the clunky
boards of early two thousands.

121
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:50,355
Today's AI assistance use NLP
to hold real conversations.

122
00:09:50,505 --> 00:09:56,805
They assist with FAQs, offer style
suggestions, event process returns all 24

123
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:59,505
by seven and often in multiple languages.

124
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:06,314
Let's not forget AI enabled fraud
detection, loyalty, program optimization,

125
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:11,594
and customer sentiment analysis from
online reviews and social media feeds,

126
00:10:11,954 --> 00:10:14,475
AI turns noise, internal knowledge.

127
00:10:16,035 --> 00:10:18,135
What's most powerful here is.

128
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,090
These use cases are interconnected.

129
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:26,699
A chat bot can collect customer
intent data, which fits into demand

130
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:31,829
forecasting, which influences
inventory, restocking the result, a

131
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:38,189
synchronized ecosystem where data flows
intelligently between functions and

132
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,235
reducing silos and maximizing efficiency.

133
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:50,010
Now that we have seen what
AI can do, let's explore core

134
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,290
technologies making it possible.

135
00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:00,180
First up is natural processing,
natural language processing, NLP.

136
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,699
This is the engine behind smart
chat bots and voice assistance.

137
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:11,625
NLP models, analyze customer
queries, understand intent, and

138
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,545
generate human-like responses.

139
00:11:14,265 --> 00:11:15,885
Next is computer vision.

140
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:22,699
This is where AI analyzes visual data,
images, videos, realtime camera feeds.

141
00:11:23,505 --> 00:11:28,335
In retail computer vision powers,
automated checkout systems, virtual try-on

142
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:31,425
apps, and even in-store thrift detection.

143
00:11:31,905 --> 00:11:36,105
For example, cameras can detect
when an item is removed from

144
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:38,145
a shelf and not scanned it.

145
00:11:38,145 --> 00:11:41,055
Checkout instantly
flagging potential loss.

146
00:11:41,805 --> 00:11:43,635
Then comes predictive analytics.

147
00:11:43,814 --> 00:11:47,055
This is where machine learning
meets business strategy.

148
00:11:47,535 --> 00:11:50,505
Predictive models analyze past behavior.

149
00:11:53,325 --> 00:11:58,545
We want to know which customer is
likely to churn or which product

150
00:11:58,545 --> 00:12:00,345
category will spike next week.

151
00:12:00,705 --> 00:12:02,985
Predictive analytics gives the edge.

152
00:12:03,585 --> 00:12:08,505
Another underrated but crucial
technology is recommendation engines.

153
00:12:09,765 --> 00:12:14,355
This systems blend collaborative filtering
with the behavioral data to generate

154
00:12:14,355 --> 00:12:17,025
real time tailored product solutions.

155
00:12:17,385 --> 00:12:22,185
They're constantly learning and
evolving as customer behavior shifts.

156
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:27,465
Each of these technologies is
supported by specific types of data.

157
00:12:28,035 --> 00:12:30,615
NLP uses text and speech.

158
00:12:30,765 --> 00:12:35,295
Computer vision requires image,
video inputs, and predictive

159
00:12:35,415 --> 00:12:40,005
analytics works best with structured
sales and transaction data.

160
00:12:40,905 --> 00:12:43,575
Together, these technologies from.

161
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:50,625
To make all these technologies accessible.

162
00:12:50,714 --> 00:12:56,714
We have AI frameworks and platforms
that development deployment and scaling.

163
00:12:57,525 --> 00:13:01,665
Let's begin by, its flexible.

164
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:09,450
For building deep learning models in
retail, it's often used for time series

165
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:15,360
demand forecasting, image based inventory
tracking, and recommendation engines.

166
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:21,300
Retailers use tensor flow to forecast
food traffic, or detect low stock

167
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,100
products through shelf imagin.

168
00:13:24,015 --> 00:13:24,854
Next is PyTorch.

169
00:13:25,395 --> 00:13:29,925
A framework allowed by researchers
and developers community for its

170
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:32,385
ease of use and dynamic computation.

171
00:13:33,224 --> 00:13:37,545
PyTorch powers, NLP Drive
chatbots, dynamic pricing models

172
00:13:37,814 --> 00:13:39,795
and sentiment analysis engines.

173
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:44,625
A small business can use PyTorch
to create a simple chatbot that

174
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:51,464
lands customer preferences over,
or monitors brand on social media.

175
00:13:53,219 --> 00:13:55,260
Moving on Microsoft Azure ai.

176
00:13:56,069 --> 00:14:02,130
This is a cloud-based suite of tools
that helps to deploy AI models at scale.

177
00:14:02,849 --> 00:14:06,750
Azure supports things like fraud
detection through anomaly detection

178
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:11,699
models wise enabled shopping assistance,
and automated product tagging.

179
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,550
It's fantastic option for businesses
that wanna rapid deployment without

180
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,245
worrying about server infrastructure.

181
00:14:20,505 --> 00:14:25,695
Then we have Amazon SageMaker,
a fully managed ML platform.

182
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:31,485
It's perfect for hyper-personalization,
supply chain optimization, and

183
00:14:31,515 --> 00:14:37,335
even real-time search ranking on
e-commerce site retailers use SageMaker

184
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,545
to fine tune product discovery a
and detect patterns in customer.

185
00:14:45,795 --> 00:14:50,954
Each of these tools support a wide
variety of data types from structured

186
00:14:50,954 --> 00:14:55,785
tables and transactional logs to
image, video, audio, and text.

187
00:14:56,865 --> 00:14:59,985
Choosing the right framework
depends on your goals.

188
00:15:00,255 --> 00:15:02,025
Are you optimizing logistic?

189
00:15:02,385 --> 00:15:04,785
Then go with TensorFlow or SageMaker.

190
00:15:05,265 --> 00:15:07,300
Building an intelligent chatbot.

191
00:15:07,964 --> 00:15:10,995
PyTorch and NLP are the best friends.

192
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:16,530
The key takeaway here is you
don't need to reinvent the wheel.

193
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:20,100
The tools are measured,
scalable, and readily available.

194
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,850
Let's explore the fuel
behind all this AI engines.

195
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:33,120
The data retail AI doesn't work
without large volumes of diverse

196
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,069
high quality data, and it.

197
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,950
It's about having the right kind of data.

198
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,930
Let's break it down by time.

199
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,720
First, we have time series data.

200
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:52,770
This is historical sales records,
foot traffic counts, seasonal trends,

201
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,410
and other metrics measured over time.

202
00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:02,745
A models like LSTM or Arima variance
can forecast demand or identify supply

203
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:04,905
chain in efficiencies using this data.

204
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,860
Then we have transaction data that
records of individual purchases.

205
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,540
This includes SKUs, payment
methods, discounts, store

206
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,060
IDs, customer IDs, and more.

207
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,980
It's the backbone for pricing
strategies, inventory, movement, and

208
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,320
customer lifetime value analysis.

209
00:16:26,925 --> 00:16:31,080
Text data is crucial for
understanding customers reviews.

210
00:16:33,585 --> 00:16:39,675
Descriptions and social media posts all
contain valuable sentiment and intent.

211
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:46,755
NLP models pass this unstructured text
to extract keywords, classify emotions,

212
00:16:46,845 --> 00:16:49,005
or generate response suggestions.

213
00:16:50,355 --> 00:16:52,845
Another measure input is visual data.

214
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:56,115
Images and videos feeds.

215
00:16:56,355 --> 00:17:01,064
Cameras are used in computer vision
models for tasks like object,

216
00:17:01,425 --> 00:17:06,345
ization, theft detection, facial
analysis, and product categorization.

217
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:13,724
Audio data is becoming more common
as voice commerce rises, voice

218
00:17:13,724 --> 00:17:19,155
assistance convert, voice to text
integrated and trigger backend systems.

219
00:17:19,185 --> 00:17:25,784
And finally we have clickstream and
behavioral data, which captures how

220
00:17:25,784 --> 00:17:28,695
users interact with apps or websites.

221
00:17:29,054 --> 00:17:30,375
Every click, scroll, or

222
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:36,284
page record, uh, page exit is recorded.

223
00:17:36,915 --> 00:17:40,215
This data is used to
improve search algorithms,

224
00:17:40,304 --> 00:17:42,554
personalized product, and reduce

225
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,155
collectively.

226
00:17:46,245 --> 00:17:47,865
These data enable.

227
00:17:48,345 --> 00:17:53,385
AI to operate in a truly
only FA omnichannel fashion.

228
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:59,055
Bridging online and instore
experiences that matters most is the

229
00:17:59,055 --> 00:18:04,575
data integration and quality, clean,
well level, and regularly updated

230
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:08,925
data sets, produced better models,
performance and deeper insights.

231
00:18:10,095 --> 00:18:12,495
The right data foundation.

232
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,030
The most powerful AI tools are
not much useful and effective.

233
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:26,159
To make this real, let's look at a
practical case study that uses open source

234
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,330
retail data to drive business decisions.

235
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,500
I worked with the data set that
include store sales history,

236
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,379
customer demographics, and
product transaction details.

237
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,090
Using machine learning, especially
recreation models and clustering,

238
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,740
have identified actionable insights
that could improve both revenue and.

239
00:18:51,554 --> 00:18:57,284
First, I segmented customers based
on demographics and BA behavior.

240
00:18:57,735 --> 00:19:02,264
This allowed for the creation of
targeted marketing campaigns that

241
00:19:02,264 --> 00:19:04,965
significantly increased conversion rates.

242
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:08,960
Second, the recreation analysis
revealed interesting trends.

243
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:14,040
For instance, certain product
categories performed in specific

244
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:16,320
seasons and geographic areas.

245
00:19:17,205 --> 00:19:22,905
This information was used to fine tune
product placement and advertising timing.

246
00:19:23,685 --> 00:19:28,844
Third, I observed inefficiencies
in inventory stocking.

247
00:19:29,355 --> 00:19:34,784
Some stores constantly overstocked
items with low demand using predictive

248
00:19:35,445 --> 00:19:41,534
models have recommended for optimal
stock levels based on forecasted demand,

249
00:19:41,895 --> 00:19:44,929
which resulted in a 12% reduction in.

250
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:52,139
I also applied a sentiment
analysis to customer reviews.

251
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,129
This helped the business to prioritize
quality control in products that

252
00:19:56,129 --> 00:20:00,540
receive frequent negative feedback
while amplifying visibility for

253
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,219
the products with strong reviews.

254
00:20:02,774 --> 00:20:09,149
Lastly, I evaluated promotional impact
using flipped modeling by comparing

255
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:12,330
customer who.

256
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:22,020
Future promotion strategies, ensuring
that discounts were targeted where

257
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,600
they have produced the highest return.

258
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,220
All of these insights came
from analyzing, structured and

259
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,960
unstructured data through ai.

260
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:36,300
What's more powerful is that these
methods are scalable, whether you are

261
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:41,580
a national chain or a small retailer,
these same techniques can be applied

262
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,670
to any business using open tools.

263
00:20:45,405 --> 00:20:48,915
Python and cloud services like Azure ml.

264
00:20:51,195 --> 00:20:55,965
As I conclude, AI is no longer
optional In retail industry.

265
00:20:56,205 --> 00:21:01,395
It's essential, whether it's through
smarter inventory control, highly

266
00:21:01,395 --> 00:21:05,655
targeted marketing, marketing,
or seamless customer experiences.

267
00:21:05,925 --> 00:21:08,025
AI delivers real value.

268
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:12,810
What's most exciting is that
we are still at the beginning.

269
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:20,040
Emerging technologies like reinforcement
learning, generative AI, and H AI are

270
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,680
just started to enter the retail world.

271
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,600
Imagine autonomous stores that
continuously optimize layout

272
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,760
based on live customer behavior or
generative models that create hyper

273
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,760
product descriptions on the fly.

274
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:41,010
We are also seeing more
emphasis on ethical ai, ensuring

275
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:45,030
fairness, transparency, and
accountability in AI systems.

276
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:51,810
This includes preventing a securing
personal data and maintaining customer

277
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,230
trust for developers and engineers.

278
00:21:55,435 --> 00:21:58,290
Focus on interdisciplinary collaboration.

279
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:03,465
Partner with marketing largest
finance team to solve real business

280
00:22:03,465 --> 00:22:05,820
problems using right tools.

281
00:22:07,005 --> 00:22:11,925
AI in retail is here to
stay and it's evolving fast.

282
00:22:12,735 --> 00:22:16,935
Whether you a small startup, a
global enterprise, embracing AI

283
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:19,095
means embracing, continuous, improve.

284
00:22:21,495 --> 00:22:24,585
