1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,110
Hello everyone and good day.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm Srijan Reddy Anugu, a
technology manager with 20 years of

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,980
experience in emerging technologies.

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,129
My expertise spans across SAP,
cloud computing, and integrations,

5
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:15,219
and I currently work for
ADM in the Cincinnati area.

6
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:19,330
Thank you for joining this conference
on cloud based data integration.

7
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,360
Today, I will be sharing the best
practices, discussing the challenges,

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,250
and unveiling innovative strategies
for modern data driven ecosystem.

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,200
Let's dive into the topic.

10
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:34,650
Cloud based data integration
is a game changer for companies

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,660
that work with different kinds
of data in today's digital world.

12
00:00:39,249 --> 00:00:44,300
In this talk, we will cover how these
systems have developed, what benefits

13
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:46,910
they offer, and the best ways to use them.

14
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:53,370
We will also see how cloud platforms
have improved older methods by making

15
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,049
data management more scalable, easier
to access, and more cost effective.

16
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:03,439
So let's talk about the evolution
of the cloud data integration.

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,249
So initially it was a traditional
on prem data integration systems.

18
00:01:08,389 --> 00:01:14,294
In the early days, companies used data
systems installed on their own hardware.

19
00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:19,874
The systems were reliable, but limited
by physical resources, needed a lot

20
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:26,184
of memory money upfront, and couldn't
easily grow with increasing data needs.

21
00:01:26,344 --> 00:01:32,454
So the example for on prem are, the
SAP data services, the Informatica

22
00:01:32,624 --> 00:01:38,044
ETL, the Dell Boomi, StrapLogic,
then, hybrid cloud strategies.

23
00:01:38,674 --> 00:01:43,924
Companies then started using a mix
of on prem and cloud solutions.

24
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:46,374
Today, about 89.

25
00:01:46,434 --> 00:01:53,434
3 percent of fortune 500 companies use
hybrid systems, spending an average of 12.

26
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:55,134
7 million a year.

27
00:01:55,614 --> 00:01:59,184
This approach combines the
security of local systems with

28
00:01:59,184 --> 00:02:00,904
the flexibility of the cloud.

29
00:02:01,674 --> 00:02:06,454
So the examples for that is, again,
a cloud SAP data services system,

30
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:14,214
Informatica ETL, a Dell Boomi, a SnapLogic
ETL system, and Apache NiFi, and AWS

31
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:17,034
Glue also supports the hybrid scenarios.

32
00:02:17,534 --> 00:02:22,434
Then the evolution of the
cloud native solutions.

33
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:28,469
Now the modern cloud native platforms are
best in terms of speed and reliability.

34
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:35,029
They can process data in just
2.3 milliseconds on average, and

35
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:41,989
maintain a 99.997% reliability
rate across different data types.

36
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:46,449
This makes it easier for
companies to handle complex data

37
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:48,879
tasks quickly and accurately.

38
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,834
And again, the example
for this of the AWS glue.

39
00:02:53,314 --> 00:02:59,134
The AWS Data Factory, Google Cloud
Data Flow, SAP Data sphere, and

40
00:02:59,134 --> 00:03:02,924
the application integration tool,
S-A-P-B-D-P integration tool.

41
00:03:03,424 --> 00:03:03,814
Okay.

42
00:03:03,964 --> 00:03:07,894
Now let's talk about the market
dynamics of this cloud platforms.

43
00:03:08,594 --> 00:03:13,664
The cloud integration market is
quickly becoming DOM dominated

44
00:03:13,664 --> 00:03:16,064
by three main platforms.

45
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:24,109
Making up almost 80% of the total market
share AWS leads with a 34.2 market share.

46
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,109
Thanks to its early start
and broad range of services.

47
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:35,659
AWS started in 2005, between 2005
to 2008, and Microsoft Azure is in

48
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:39,319
second place with 27.8 Azure as.

49
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:44,449
Picked up a lot in, last five
years, showing an impressive growth

50
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:46,369
of 42 percent year over year.

51
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:51,289
And Google Cloud Platform holds 16.

52
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:54,819
4 percent of the market,
excelling in the artificial

53
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:57,099
intelligence and machine learning.

54
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:00,529
Together, these platforms
handle a massive 7.

55
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:04,219
84 trillion integration
transactions every day.

56
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:10,339
About the same as processing all the
data in the Library of Congress every 3.

57
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:11,589
2 seconds.

58
00:04:12,089 --> 00:04:16,929
So what are the key, benefits of
using this, cloud based integrations?

59
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:22,019
So the first thing that comes
is, elasticity and scalability.

60
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:26,449
So in a traditional on prem system,
scaling up a system, scaling

61
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,199
out or scaling up is a big task.

62
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:32,019
It's a downtime and it
affects the business.

63
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:35,009
With the cloud systems, it is on the fly.

64
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,689
and, we can.

65
00:04:37,464 --> 00:04:43,374
Set the settings up such that if the load
is more the autoscale scalability happens.

66
00:04:43,874 --> 00:04:46,124
So scalability is one
of the primary factors.

67
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:48,164
And global accessibility.

68
00:04:48,764 --> 00:04:55,644
So there are many data centers for AWS
Azure, Google, Alibaba, and Oracle Cloud.

69
00:04:56,074 --> 00:04:58,924
So they are omnipresent across the globe.

70
00:04:59,594 --> 00:05:03,794
So because of those data
centers, the data accessibility.

71
00:05:04,294 --> 00:05:06,074
is the core component, right?

72
00:05:06,204 --> 00:05:09,034
So the speed increased,
the reliability increased.

73
00:05:09,534 --> 00:05:11,414
And next, the cost optimization.

74
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:15,154
Moving to cloud integration
can significantly cut costs,

75
00:05:15,454 --> 00:05:17,084
especially for security.

76
00:05:17,504 --> 00:05:22,954
Organizations can reduce their security
expenses by nearly 60 percent compared

77
00:05:22,954 --> 00:05:29,226
to traditional on premise solutions, with
average security coming in at only 3.

78
00:05:29,226 --> 00:05:31,714
27 per GB of data processed.

79
00:05:32,214 --> 00:05:38,554
Now, let's talk about What happens by
following the best architectural practices

80
00:05:39,174 --> 00:05:41,234
for cloud native tool integrations?

81
00:05:41,984 --> 00:05:45,424
So it reduces the
deployment failures by 72.

82
00:05:45,484 --> 00:05:52,284
3 percentage Through automated testing
and standardized workflows and it

83
00:05:52,284 --> 00:05:55,254
enhances the resolution speed by 58.

84
00:05:55,304 --> 00:06:01,074
6 with better monitoring and the
automated rollback and enabling

85
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:05,384
in near continuous delivery with
95 percent weekly deployments to

86
00:06:05,384 --> 00:06:07,454
streamline the deployment pipelines.

87
00:06:07,455 --> 00:06:09,284
These tools leverage containerization.

88
00:06:09,784 --> 00:06:15,704
orchestration and automated workflows
to accelerate deployment speed

89
00:06:15,884 --> 00:06:19,914
and maintain high reliability,
allowing teams to respond more

90
00:06:20,384 --> 00:06:23,074
effectively for the business needs.

91
00:06:23,574 --> 00:06:28,334
And the another one, the modern
microservices architectures

92
00:06:28,364 --> 00:06:32,894
transform cloud computing by
dividing monolithic appliances.

93
00:06:33,429 --> 00:06:35,639
into independently scalable services.

94
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,579
This approach significantly
enhances deployment flexibility,

95
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:45,579
system reliability, and operational
efficiency, especially in large

96
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:49,029
scale cloud environments where
traditional architecture faces

97
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:51,889
challenges with complexity and scale.

98
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:54,579
Now, how is the data quality?

99
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:57,804
and governance in cloud
native architecture.

100
00:06:58,304 --> 00:07:02,894
So automated data validation,
smart validation tools have

101
00:07:02,894 --> 00:07:06,454
reduced data issues by 87.

102
00:07:06,455 --> 00:07:09,314
3 percent and boosted
data consistency by 92.

103
00:07:09,364 --> 00:07:15,034
1 percent across various system
parts making operations smoother

104
00:07:15,204 --> 00:07:16,504
and analytics more reliable.

105
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:18,574
Compliance management.

106
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:24,464
Modern cloud systems have streamlined
compliance, cutting audit operation

107
00:07:24,484 --> 00:07:29,984
time by almost 74 percent and
increasing audit success by 41.

108
00:07:30,014 --> 00:07:30,594
2 percent.

109
00:07:31,144 --> 00:07:36,184
This means companies can meet strict
rules while reducing extra paperwork.

110
00:07:36,684 --> 00:07:37,944
Metadata management.

111
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:43,824
Advanced tools for managing metadata
have sped up data discovery by 68.

112
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:49,564
5 percent and improving data tracking
accuracy by nearly 80 percent.

113
00:07:49,574 --> 00:07:55,374
This gives organizations a clear view
of the data flow, helping them make

114
00:07:55,384 --> 00:07:58,439
decisions quickly and with Confidence.

115
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:01,329
Real time processing capabilities.

116
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:04,709
What do we get with this real
time processing capabilities?

117
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,119
So low latency.

118
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:10,989
Our system process data almost
instantly, taking just 8.

119
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:13,749
7 milliseconds for complex events.

120
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:17,429
It reliably delivers messages with a 99.

121
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:19,459
997 success rate.

122
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:22,149
So data loss is nearly eliminated.

123
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:23,149
High throughput.

124
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:25,939
It can handle huge amounts of data.

125
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:27,049
Processing 2.

126
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:32,659
8 million events every second, a 312
percent improvement over old systems.

127
00:08:32,869 --> 00:08:37,909
This boost makes real time analytics
possible on a large scale systems.

128
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:43,569
So that is the reason why OLAP and
OLTP supported systems are built now.

129
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:46,889
Edge computing with edge processing.

130
00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:51,429
We reduce response times by
over 90 percent globally.

131
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:55,609
Our distributed systems maintain
data accuracy with a 99.

132
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:01,359
999 percent consistency rate, ensuring
reliable performance everywhere.

133
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:05,139
Now, let's talk about some
common challenges and the

134
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:07,539
solution for those challenges.

135
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:10,439
So the common challenges are data silos.

136
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:14,189
Performance optimization
and security and compliance.

137
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:19,819
So coming to the data silos, using
schema matching and mapping techniques,

138
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:23,309
improves data integration accuracy by 64.

139
00:09:23,369 --> 00:09:27,909
2 percent and cuts down manual work by 57.

140
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,549
8%. Performance optimization.

141
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:36,369
Query optimization frameworks
reduce data retrieval time by 47.

142
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:40,589
3 percent on average while
keeping data consistency at 99.

143
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,099
95%.

144
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,349
Security and compliance.

145
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:47,779
Multi layer security frameworks
lower security incidents.

146
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,799
By 92.

147
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:54,634
4 percent with only a minimal
increase in data access time, just 3.

148
00:09:54,634 --> 00:10:01,069
7 milliseconds by using this cloud
native data integration solutions.

149
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:06,139
So now let's talk about the future trends
in the cloud based data integration.

150
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,859
So right now we do have
cloud based data integration.

151
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:13,029
What's the future of the
cloud based data integration?

152
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:17,589
First thing we could talk about
is AI argumented integration.

153
00:10:18,514 --> 00:10:19,904
AI is the buzzword now.

154
00:10:20,214 --> 00:10:25,534
So new AI tools can speed up
integration work, cutting development

155
00:10:25,544 --> 00:10:30,274
time by over half, and improving
error detection significantly.

156
00:10:30,604 --> 00:10:34,544
This lets developers spend more
time on important projects instead

157
00:10:34,544 --> 00:10:35,974
of routine troubleshooting.

158
00:10:36,474 --> 00:10:42,294
And second one is, advanced meta
management, metadata management, right?

159
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:45,854
So metadata is the heart of any company.

160
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:51,499
So for that, the modern metadata
systems automatically match data

161
00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:56,849
formats with high accuracy, greatly
reducing the need for manual setup.

162
00:10:57,349 --> 00:11:01,189
Tasks that used to take weeks
can now be done in hours.

163
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:05,579
The third, that I could talk about is
intelligent data quality monitoring.

164
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:11,079
So real time monitoring systems are
now much better at catching and fixing

165
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:16,449
errors quickly, ensuring data stays
reliable and useful across all platforms.

166
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:20,469
So the quicker we fix the
data, the quicker solution.

167
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:23,599
The business gets the data
immediately and the decision is

168
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,319
made immediately based on the data.

169
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,519
To conclude, transformative impact.

170
