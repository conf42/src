1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,150
Hello, welcome to my talk.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,229
Today I'm going to talk about how
I spoke to cha g pity about things.

3
00:00:06,729 --> 00:00:10,030
All of these experiments were
conducted on Cha g Pity three.

4
00:00:10,879 --> 00:00:13,129
So this was like a really long time ago.

5
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:18,250
But as we go through this talk, you'll
actually realize why this was an

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:24,810
important sort of exercise to be done,
especially on the primitive not really

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,270
primitive, but like primitive versions
of pure elements or pure language models.

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,880
Some of these exercises are
like fun experiments that are

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,460
conducted with Ja GT three.

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,559
The first one is where we ask Cha gt.

11
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,429
They were conducted on a
personal free use account.

12
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:45,059
So the call t will vary you depending
upon whether you are using like

13
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,709
Chad GP Plus or something else.

14
00:00:47,209 --> 00:00:50,840
So at some points I just basically
decided to ask Chad Gpt a bunch of

15
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,120
really weird questions that I thought
it wouldn't be able to answer to check

16
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,599
the viability of the A GI theory.

17
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:01,420
So these are some of the examples.

18
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:04,390
The first one is when is
a door no longer a door?

19
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,140
So the answer was, a door is no longer
a door when it's no longer serves the

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,870
purpose of providing an entrance or
exit to a room or building or when

21
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,360
it's unable to be open or closed.

22
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,490
So what I decided was, let me give
it like some more context because

23
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,520
it's way possible that it has
been trained on this data before.

24
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,600
So I was like this is
a riddle, so answer it.

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,420
When is a door no longer a door?

26
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,470
And that's when all the
training basically kicked in.

27
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,950
The productive modeling kicked in
and it said a door is no longer a

28
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,460
door when it's a jar, which is right.

29
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,470
That's the right answer of the riddle.

30
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,230
The second one was, what
tastes better than it smells?

31
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,430
And at this point, JG PT
basically understood that we

32
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,270
were in like the context of
answering griddles or something.

33
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,710
So it was like this is a riddle.

34
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,860
It told me that this is a riddle.

35
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,730
And the answer is UNK because it
tastes food but does not have a smell.

36
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,800
Which was the right answer.

37
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,000
The next question was, what
building has the most stories?

38
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,710
And it basically recognized the
fact that this was still a riddle.

39
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,890
And the answer was library because it has
many stories, what has bottom at the top.

40
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,100
So again, Chad Jupiter was
like, this is a riddle.

41
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:25,079
The answer is a staircase because
it has a bottom step at the top when

42
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:28,280
you reach the top of the staircase,
which was not the right answer.

43
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,020
'cause the right answer is actually legs.

44
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:36,300
But it did recognize the fact that
we were in riddle mode and it went

45
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,000
into a story mode of thoughts.

46
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,710
A little bit of imagination.

47
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:44,180
I don't think it's like sourcing
all of this data from its

48
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,350
previous training, though.

49
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,900
I do believe for the co last couple
examples, we did source a lot

50
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,490
of data from previous training.

51
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:58,160
I. So Chad GP D had at some points in
all of its tasks and all of its examples,

52
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:03,140
seen those examples before in either
like q and a task or something else.

53
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,295
So some other examples were
what has four wheels and twice.

54
00:03:08,175 --> 00:03:11,745
It's still in this mode where it's
this is a riddle, and the answer is

55
00:03:11,745 --> 00:03:15,465
a garbage truck because it has four
wheels and it moves around to collect

56
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:19,245
garbage, which can be considered
as flying through the streets.

57
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:23,865
That's not the right answer actually,
but like it does make up like a

58
00:03:23,865 --> 00:03:30,225
lot of imaginative shit when it
encounters questions that are

59
00:03:30,315 --> 00:03:34,435
really, but it doesn't really have
any good answers to those questions.

60
00:03:34,935 --> 00:03:37,665
What month of the year has 28 days in it?

61
00:03:38,165 --> 00:03:39,305
And it's this is a riddle.

62
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:43,985
And it says that all the 12 months of
the year have at least 28 days in it.

63
00:03:44,135 --> 00:03:45,365
Which is the right answer.

64
00:03:46,215 --> 00:03:50,175
A lot of humans get this wrong 'cause
they're like it's just Feb. What can

65
00:03:50,175 --> 00:03:52,185
you put in a bucket to make it way less?

66
00:03:52,455 --> 00:03:53,265
This is a riddle.

67
00:03:53,715 --> 00:03:57,765
The answer is a hole because a hole in a
bucket decreases the weight of the bucket.

68
00:03:58,715 --> 00:03:59,345
That's right.

69
00:03:59,845 --> 00:04:04,374
And it's not like it has a lot of
intuitive thinking about, oh, this

70
00:04:04,374 --> 00:04:06,054
is what the physical world is like.

71
00:04:06,085 --> 00:04:10,524
If you drill a hole at the bottom
of a container, it's going to

72
00:04:10,524 --> 00:04:12,144
make a lot of its contents.

73
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:16,064
Spell out what starts with the
t. Ends with a T and has T in it.

74
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:17,324
This is a riddle.

75
00:04:17,564 --> 00:04:20,865
The answer is teapot because
it starts with a T, ends with

76
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,424
a T and has T in the middle.

77
00:04:23,144 --> 00:04:27,965
It got that but I think all of those were
like extremely classic examples of riles.

78
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:33,094
And based on all of the corpus that
JG PT had been trained on before,

79
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:36,844
it probably had gone through all of
those examples before in its training.

80
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:40,074
Where is the only place where
today comes before yesterday?

81
00:04:41,004 --> 00:04:41,754
This is a riddle.

82
00:04:42,264 --> 00:04:46,314
The answer is in a dictionary because the
words are listed in alphabetical order.

83
00:04:46,814 --> 00:04:49,574
What goes all around the
world, but stays in a corner.

84
00:04:50,054 --> 00:04:50,894
This is a riddle.

85
00:04:51,254 --> 00:04:52,244
The answer is a stamp.

86
00:04:52,604 --> 00:04:56,564
It goes all around the world when
it is used on letters and postcards,

87
00:04:56,809 --> 00:05:01,324
but it is physically located in a
corner of the envelope I'm used to

88
00:05:01,324 --> 00:05:03,214
bat with, yet I never get a hit.

89
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:06,364
I'm near a ball, yet it is never thrown.

90
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:10,504
Why am I, this is a riddle, and
the answer is a baseball bat.

91
00:05:10,954 --> 00:05:13,624
It's used to bat with,
but it never gets a hit.

92
00:05:14,224 --> 00:05:16,414
It's near a ball, but
the ball is never true.

93
00:05:16,914 --> 00:05:20,864
And at some point I'm like sometimes
it gets a lot of these things wrong.

94
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:24,934
And it starts making up a lot of
like imaginative stories about

95
00:05:25,234 --> 00:05:26,794
what the real answer could be like.

96
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:32,334
And it tries to like basically fitted
all of those stories into the narrative

97
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:36,684
so that it seems like the answer that
it's giving me is the right answer.

98
00:05:37,184 --> 00:05:40,664
So I tried prompting it, saying,
can there be another answer?

99
00:05:41,164 --> 00:05:46,024
And it was basically like when you're
trying to hint to your friends when

100
00:05:46,024 --> 00:05:49,464
you're playing riddles with each
other and you are like this is a hint.

101
00:05:49,524 --> 00:05:51,624
Why don't you take this as a hint?

102
00:05:52,124 --> 00:05:55,304
Or Why don't you think
of any other answers?

103
00:05:55,304 --> 00:05:57,224
Do you think there could
be any other answers?

104
00:05:57,734 --> 00:06:02,294
And it did give me back another
imaginative answer, which was a baseball

105
00:06:02,294 --> 00:06:05,294
glove, which is also not the right answer.

106
00:06:05,714 --> 00:06:10,444
But you can see where this is basically
thinking process of a language model.

107
00:06:10,624 --> 00:06:16,204
You're literally seeing it think, and
this was before all of the RAG or any

108
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:18,634
other sort of layers on top of Cha Gt.

109
00:06:18,994 --> 00:06:21,184
This is pure language models.

110
00:06:21,484 --> 00:06:26,824
So you can see it thinking when you
say, can there be another answer?

111
00:06:27,324 --> 00:06:32,544
Because it has already made up a lot
of imaginative storytelling to fit

112
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:34,514
a certain answer into this riddle.

113
00:06:35,014 --> 00:06:37,984
It's thinking along
those same sort of lines.

114
00:06:38,554 --> 00:06:42,874
'cause the answer that it gets
back to is the baseball globe

115
00:06:42,964 --> 00:06:44,584
as opposed to the baseball bat.

116
00:06:45,084 --> 00:06:47,544
Unfortunately that was not
the right answer actually.

117
00:06:47,844 --> 00:06:52,364
But I just decided to continue
and tried to change the genre

118
00:06:52,364 --> 00:06:54,434
basically, like the geography.

119
00:06:55,004 --> 00:06:57,764
So my question was, I heard
Arabian Knights first.

120
00:06:58,604 --> 00:07:00,704
My queen was the writer
of the great story.

121
00:07:00,704 --> 00:07:03,664
Guess my name, and it
says this is a riddle.

122
00:07:04,544 --> 00:07:09,334
This is not a riddle actually, it's
just a question that's framed in a

123
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:14,094
specific manner in order to confuse the
person you're seeking an answer from.

124
00:07:14,594 --> 00:07:17,594
So Chad Gri at this point was
like it's like in riddle mode.

125
00:07:17,594 --> 00:07:23,624
So it keeps on assuming that the context
is still riddle mode, and it says to

126
00:07:23,624 --> 00:07:28,814
me, this is a riddle, and the answer is
shares adi, which is not the right answer.

127
00:07:29,314 --> 00:07:32,674
Because the question is, my queen
was the writer of the Great story.

128
00:07:32,764 --> 00:07:33,724
Guess my name.

129
00:07:34,224 --> 00:07:36,084
It does get all the context.

130
00:07:36,184 --> 00:07:38,464
It's like she's a queen in the collection.

131
00:07:38,494 --> 00:07:42,874
It's a Middle Eastern folk
tales known as 1001 Knights,

132
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,214
also known as Arabian Knights.

133
00:07:45,304 --> 00:07:48,904
She's the storyteller of the
Tales, which are also known as

134
00:07:48,904 --> 00:07:52,134
the Tales of 1,001 Arabian Nights.

135
00:07:52,794 --> 00:07:53,244
Okay.

136
00:07:53,744 --> 00:08:00,634
But it did make a way human mistake
here by telling me that my name is

137
00:08:00,634 --> 00:08:02,934
Cher Zdi as opposed to the King's name.

138
00:08:03,434 --> 00:08:09,184
So that basically worked like in my head
I was like I was able to track trick Chad

139
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:17,144
Jupiter into being confused just using,
a specific method in which you ask tricky

140
00:08:17,144 --> 00:08:20,144
questions, which also works with humans.

141
00:08:20,644 --> 00:08:26,044
So we just basically decided to continue
and I moved on to another genre of sorts.

142
00:08:26,304 --> 00:08:31,079
Basically currently I was in fiction,
so I'd been asking it questions about

143
00:08:31,184 --> 00:08:36,844
like physics or physical phenomenon
or sports or something related to

144
00:08:37,624 --> 00:08:39,904
actually perceiving or observing.

145
00:08:39,994 --> 00:08:43,894
And now I basically moved on
to some fictional results.

146
00:08:44,394 --> 00:08:47,784
So my question was, what do you
call a rabbit that has fleas?

147
00:08:48,284 --> 00:08:49,874
And Chad g pity is this is a riddle.

148
00:08:50,374 --> 00:08:53,584
And the answer is bug
bunny as its apply onwards.

149
00:08:54,394 --> 00:08:58,924
Bug bunny is a cartoon rabbit,
and bugs is also another word

150
00:08:58,924 --> 00:09:00,454
for fleas, but it's right.

151
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:05,334
This comes from like a certain
source of fiction that it

152
00:09:05,334 --> 00:09:07,134
was trained on specifically.

153
00:09:07,134 --> 00:09:12,614
So it knows like the references, what
you get if you pour boiling hot water

154
00:09:12,614 --> 00:09:15,224
down a rabbit hole, this is a riddle.

155
00:09:15,824 --> 00:09:19,514
The answer is hot cross
bunnies as a supply onwards.

156
00:09:19,844 --> 00:09:24,674
Hot cross bunnies sounds like
hot cross buns and the word bunny

157
00:09:24,674 --> 00:09:26,354
is another name for a rabbit.

158
00:09:26,854 --> 00:09:30,414
So I did to a certain
extent understand punts.

159
00:09:30,774 --> 00:09:34,614
Whether it's like intuitively
understanding punts, whether it's

160
00:09:34,619 --> 00:09:40,344
capable of making bunts by itself or
whether it was drained on this specific

161
00:09:40,464 --> 00:09:45,354
bun, is something that at this point,
because we are looking at it as if

162
00:09:45,354 --> 00:09:47,604
it was a black box, we don't know.

163
00:09:48,104 --> 00:09:53,054
So we would basically have to devise like
a bunch of other tests to figure out if.

164
00:09:54,014 --> 00:09:59,444
It was actually intuitively understanding
how to make a pun, or whether it was

165
00:09:59,444 --> 00:10:07,425
just trained on this data to mimic
or to basically remember that it was

166
00:10:07,425 --> 00:10:13,035
trained on this data and remembered
through its neural network that

167
00:10:13,035 --> 00:10:14,954
the answer is hot crust bunnies.

168
00:10:15,454 --> 00:10:21,405
So I just went on what has to be broken
before you can use it, and it's like this

169
00:10:21,405 --> 00:10:23,265
is a riddle, and the answer is an egg.

170
00:10:23,715 --> 00:10:27,495
It has to be broken in order to
use it, and cooking or eating.

171
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:30,455
I'm tall when I'm young,
and I'm short when I'm old.

172
00:10:30,575 --> 00:10:31,055
What am I?

173
00:10:31,555 --> 00:10:32,455
This is a riddle.

174
00:10:32,485 --> 00:10:33,745
The answer is a candle.

175
00:10:34,195 --> 00:10:39,655
A candle is tall when it's new and has
not been burned, but it becomes short as

176
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:41,570
it burns down and gets short with age.

177
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:42,520
It's right.

178
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,650
Classic riddle, what is always in
front of you, but can't be seen.

179
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,210
This is a riddle.

180
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,500
The answer is the future as it's
always in front of you, but cannot be

181
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,150
seen because it hasn't happened yet.

182
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,550
Technically it's right.

183
00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:01,020
And this is one of those philosophical
genre based riddles of sorts.

184
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,389
At this point, it used to like the
observer of Chad GTI as a black box.

185
00:11:07,109 --> 00:11:15,660
It would seem that Chad GTI did in fact
understand some human philosophy, which at

186
00:11:15,685 --> 00:11:20,380
that point, 'cause it was Ja GBT three at
the point was like awe inspiring, right?

187
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:24,710
So I just decided to go further
into this rabbit hole of sorts.

188
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,600
Because I was getting some
very interesting signals.

189
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,060
So I was like on a table, there
are two apples on the plate.

190
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,590
Three men are eating it.

191
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,980
How should one not eat an apple?

192
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,950
And cha, but he's this is a riddle.

193
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,870
The answer is one of the men is a doctor
because the doctor would not eat an

194
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:49,120
apple as he would be the one giving
advice on how to not eat the apple.

195
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,199
And I think that answer was wrong,
but like it, it's so imaginative.

196
00:11:54,229 --> 00:11:59,839
It just made up like a whole story
about how if you are a doctor,

197
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,380
you're not supposed to eat an apple,
though the actual saying is, an

198
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,060
apple a day gives the doctor away.

199
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,310
So I went on and I was like, if
five rabbits eat five apples in

200
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,939
five minutes, how many apples
will 10 rabbits eat in 10 minutes?

201
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:20,449
This is a classic work problem that a
lot of people actually have to solve when

202
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,260
they're doing any sort of math problems.

203
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,800
And it's still in riddle mode,
so it's this is the riddle.

204
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,390
The answer is five apples.

205
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,069
This is because the problem doesn't take
into account the fact, but eating the

206
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:36,090
apples would take a different amount of
time depending upon the number of rabbits.

207
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,069
Instead, the problem only relates
to the number of apples and the

208
00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:45,795
time given incredibly weird math,
but you have to understand that.

209
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:51,604
GP three was never linked to any
sort of math engine to do any sort

210
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,265
of math and would get like the
most basic math questions wrong.

211
00:12:55,895 --> 00:12:59,255
And this is an example of such a problem.

212
00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:06,195
So when it's purely language based
language model, it does seem to get

213
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:11,535
a lot of mathematical problems wrong,
though the way that humans learn

214
00:13:11,535 --> 00:13:18,705
language or humans learn mathematics
is primarily through language they do

215
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:24,595
because in most school curriculums,
all of the problems that people solve

216
00:13:25,435 --> 00:13:27,595
are closely related to language.

217
00:13:28,315 --> 00:13:33,295
People specifically have a lot of
problems with respect to a man buying

218
00:13:33,295 --> 00:13:37,945
like 10 watermelons and then spending
like x amount of money and such.

219
00:13:38,445 --> 00:13:42,765
So technically you would think
that a large language model would

220
00:13:42,765 --> 00:13:47,945
be okay, understanding math, not
through a math engine, but instead

221
00:13:47,945 --> 00:13:49,925
through language like humans do.

222
00:13:50,425 --> 00:13:53,785
So I just went on suppose
you're touring on a bus with 10

223
00:13:53,785 --> 00:13:57,295
passengers, two descendant, and
four climbed on the first stand.

224
00:13:57,895 --> 00:14:01,135
Five descended, and two climbed on
the second stand, two descended and

225
00:14:01,135 --> 00:14:02,365
three climbed on the next stand.

226
00:14:02,935 --> 00:14:05,605
Now tell me how many passengers
are traveling on the bus.

227
00:14:06,105 --> 00:14:10,959
So it basically gave me like the
wrong answer and then it basically

228
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,579
got confused because it thought that
it had to explain why the answer

229
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:17,800
is what it thinks the answer is.

230
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,299
And went into like deep math
with, like each statement

231
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:26,529
corresponding to like mathematical
operation and still got it wrong.

232
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:31,319
A prime example of behavior that's
actually seen in human kids, like

233
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:35,069
human children when they're like, I
want to say five or six years old,

234
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:41,769
where we lose track of the mathematical
operations that they are conducting.

235
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:47,089
Especially if they have like multiple
tasks and multiple steps and they

236
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:48,769
basically lose track of history.

237
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:53,689
So while it was telling me things, 'cause
this is like a predictive language model,

238
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:58,459
while it was telling me things, it was
losing track of what it was telling me.

239
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,789
There was no current memory.

240
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:02,519
To charge three.

241
00:15:02,729 --> 00:15:07,239
I don't know if the current models
have any current memory, like when

242
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:12,819
they're telling you things, whether
they have good memory or track of

243
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:16,619
what they're telling you in the moment
that they're telling you those things.

244
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:19,640
Apart from all of the
proactive modeling and such.

245
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,710
Because proactive modeling is oh,
what word would come next as opposed

246
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,740
to, or this is the calculation
that is supposed to match up to the

247
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,300
practical modeling that I've done.

248
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:37,380
And at that point I basically
was like I have no way of knowing

249
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:42,530
if JT three was actually trained
on this data in the sense that.

250
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:47,380
Whether all of this data or all of these
riddles were part of its carus ever

251
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:52,290
'cause the carus was huge or whether it
was actually being extremely intuitive.

252
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,410
'cause when you're playing riddles with
your friend, usually you are not allowed

253
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,140
to look up any sort of information.

254
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,440
You're not supposed to cheat, you're
not supposed to ask anyone else.

255
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,300
You are just supposed to rack your brains.

256
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,160
Sometimes you would've played the
game before and would remember it from

257
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:16,560
previous instances, but I think in most
cases you are supposed to be asking

258
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,240
each other questions that you've never
heard before and making connections

259
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,280
that you've never made before and
basically thinking outside the box.

260
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:30,700
So that was this, the test that I
was like performing on g PT three.

261
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,730
So at the point I was like it could be a
part of the corpus that it was trained on.

262
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:41,100
So I decided that I was going to
look up riddles in another language,

263
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,780
and in this case it was Hindi.

264
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,900
I'm just going to translate them.

265
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,130
And I'm going to ask Chad, GPD,
those riddles because I was assuming

266
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:54,470
that it would not have been trained
on data that was available on the

267
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:59,330
internet in a language other than
English and did not have any sort of

268
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,420
corresponding English translation.

269
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,130
So some of these examples
are from that data.

270
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,610
For instance, Ajay's parents have three
sons, which I wish, and the third son is.

271
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,070
It does get it right.

272
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,510
It's like Ajay is the third son.

273
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:18,680
This is something that actually
stumps a lot of humans who has

274
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,330
many words but does not speak.

275
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,200
This is a real, the answer is a
book because a book contains many

276
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,530
words but does not speak a car.

277
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:30,550
Gives milk a hand gives an egg,
which gives both milk and egg.

278
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:36,000
D so as you can see, this is like an
extremely crudely translated version

279
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:42,060
of a rootle that I think was either
in Hindi or some regional language.

280
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,870
And it comes up with the
weirdest story you've ever heard.

281
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,160
It's what is riddle?

282
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,300
And the answer is a duck.

283
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:53,190
Ducks are domesticated bulls that are
kept for their eggs, meat, and feathers.

284
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,700
They're also known to give milk,
which can be used to make dairy

285
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,920
products like cheese and butter.

286
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:04,750
And at the point I basically wondered
if there was like a brand called Duck

287
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:11,100
Dairy Farm or something, which would
basically trick a language model into

288
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:18,480
believing that there is such a thing as
a duck giving milk and eggs or something.

289
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,600
Another two ants, head of
ants, two ants behind ants

290
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,260
say, how many ants this riddle?

291
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,700
The answer is two ants.

292
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,035
And the actual answer is three ants.

293
00:18:31,535 --> 00:18:35,425
And like it actually makes no
sense that it got this wrong.

294
00:18:35,455 --> 00:18:40,945
But I'm pretty sure if I had put in
something like two ducks ahead of ducks,

295
00:18:41,845 --> 00:18:45,175
two ducks behind ducks, how many ducks?

296
00:18:45,445 --> 00:18:46,645
It would say three ducks.

297
00:18:47,145 --> 00:18:50,925
Because the classic griddle
is with ducks and not ants.

298
00:18:51,285 --> 00:18:56,025
So if you're using a productive model
with respect to language that does not

299
00:18:56,025 --> 00:19:00,875
actually intuitively understand what
you're saying in the sense that it's

300
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:08,925
not able to imagine, it's not able to
imagine in its mind that there's two ants

301
00:19:08,985 --> 00:19:12,525
ahead of ants and two ants behind ants.

302
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:14,255
So how many ants?

303
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:15,905
It's an imaginative question.

304
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,005
You have to be able to visualize.

305
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:19,015
The end.

306
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:24,735
It would rely on previous training and
it would rely on everything that people

307
00:19:24,735 --> 00:19:28,155
would have ever said to it, like history.

308
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:33,175
It would be remembering things or it
would be if you tell it like the task

309
00:19:33,175 --> 00:19:35,755
is to identify upon or to make upon.

310
00:19:35,905 --> 00:19:40,965
It would be making or like mimicking
a pun, which means it would not

311
00:19:40,965 --> 00:19:47,745
necessarily get the right answer
that you want it to get, which I

312
00:19:47,745 --> 00:19:50,505
do believe most humans are capable.

313
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:54,015
Capable, they're able to get to
the right answer when they're

314
00:19:54,015 --> 00:19:55,515
playing riddles with each other.

315
00:19:56,015 --> 00:19:58,475
What is the thing that
can be soaked in the rain?

316
00:19:58,535 --> 00:19:59,705
It can never get wet.

317
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:01,065
This is a riddle.

318
00:20:01,485 --> 00:20:04,725
The answer is a sponge because
it absorbs water or stokes

319
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:06,515
it up, but it never gets wet.

320
00:20:06,995 --> 00:20:08,435
That's not the right answer actually.

321
00:20:08,435 --> 00:20:11,785
It's something like watch or
never gets wet or something.

322
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:15,375
It's a classic griddle, but I
don't think it's like that popular

323
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:19,095
in English as opposed to the
regional language that it came from

324
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:21,635
is, so tell me what's in your pockets?

325
00:20:22,415 --> 00:20:26,645
Zhan replied, there is something in
my pocket and nothing in my pocket.

326
00:20:27,605 --> 00:20:28,895
Tell me how can this happen?

327
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,815
And it just basically went on
like this philosophical rant

328
00:20:32,845 --> 00:20:34,195
that I was not expecting.

329
00:20:34,255 --> 00:20:36,385
And it's very interesting
to me, to be honest.

330
00:20:36,415 --> 00:20:40,315
'cause it's, it reads almost like
philosophical essay of salts.

331
00:20:40,465 --> 00:20:41,605
It's this is a riddle.

332
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:45,025
Sohan replied that there is
something in his pocket and nothing

333
00:20:45,025 --> 00:20:47,705
in his pocket, like scro of salts.

334
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,455
Which means that he was
carrying an empty pocket.

335
00:20:50,485 --> 00:20:53,905
An empty pocket is something
because it is physically

336
00:20:53,905 --> 00:20:55,825
present, but it contains nothing.

337
00:20:56,325 --> 00:21:01,685
The answer was that he had a hole in
his pocket, actually, so nothing but

338
00:21:01,685 --> 00:21:05,465
there was a hole in his pocket, so there
was actually something in his pocket.

339
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:09,325
What is the thing that always
increases but never decreases?

340
00:21:09,825 --> 00:21:10,035
This?

341
00:21:10,515 --> 00:21:14,175
The answer is age or time,
because it always goes forward

342
00:21:14,235 --> 00:21:15,585
and never goes backward.

343
00:21:16,085 --> 00:21:17,885
There are 10 birds sitting on a wall.

344
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:20,045
A person shoots one of them with an arrow.

345
00:21:20,285 --> 00:21:21,125
How many are left?

346
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,455
There would be nine
birds left on the wall.

347
00:21:23,455 --> 00:21:28,195
If one bird is shot with a arrow, there
will be one fewer birds on the wall.

348
00:21:28,695 --> 00:21:29,745
Practically impossible.

349
00:21:29,745 --> 00:21:33,130
Most of the birds would have, they
would just basically fly away, right?

350
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,410
They would fly away.

351
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:39,240
In reality, in physical reality, if
there were 10 boats sitting on a wall

352
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:43,950
and you shot one of them with an arrow,
all of the other boats would fly away.

353
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,980
And that's the answer
that you're looking for.

354
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,680
Either all of them fly away
or some of them fly away,

355
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,710
but the answer is ambiguous.

356
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:54,490
It's not as simple as there would
be nine boats left on the wall.

357
00:21:55,390 --> 00:22:01,490
At this point, Chad, GPT basically didn't
know the behavior of boats in the sense

358
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:06,710
of oh, if one bird is shot, when there
there was like 10 boats sitting on a wall.

359
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,130
It didn't know that birds fly away.

360
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:14,480
It was basically treating birds as if
they were like inanimate objects like

361
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,130
bolts and not like real living beings.

362
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:23,700
People making their own decisions
and such and reacting to stimuli.

363
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,660
As you can see, I was getting
like extremely interesting

364
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,820
signals from this whole exercise.

365
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,170
And I just decided to go forward with
everything else, which is a room that

366
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,730
has neither or window nor a door.

367
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,080
This or riddle.

368
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,400
The answer is a mushroom.

369
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,700
A mushroom is the type of
fungus that grows in the ground.

370
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,790
It does not have windows or doors.

371
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,740
Now, this is a pun
because it's a mushroom.

372
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,320
What is the thing that is broken and
there is no sound even after breaking it.

373
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,220
And the answer is an egg.

374
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,540
Because when you break an egg, it
makes no sound even though it's broken.

375
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,970
I've never met an egg that didn't
make a sound when it was broken.

376
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,680
And the real answer was silence.

377
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,320
But it was like philosophical of thoughts.

378
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,990
So if you would have ever read anything
philosophical we broke silence.

379
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,420
So now it's broken.

380
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:20,440
And 'cause it was an abstract concept,
like the silence was an abstract concept.

381
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:24,670
So silence was broken basic English usage.

382
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:30,330
At the point it didn't, I think it
does better now, but one can never

383
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:35,910
be sure if it's like because of the
corpus or if it's just been trained on

384
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:41,770
all of these examples or whether it's
cheating in the sense of it's using RG.

385
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:46,080
Which is where it's like straight up
looking up answers for all of these

386
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,940
questions on the web, which is not
what you want your friend to do if

387
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:55,340
you're playing riddles with them, or if
you are testing like a bot or a large

388
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:00,680
language model for prices of aj, you
basically don't want them to be cheating.

389
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:07,300
That's useful for all other sort of sorts
of tasks and we'll get back to why it

390
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:12,370
could actually be fatal like the misuse
of our age and all those sort of things

391
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,110
to accomplish even practical tasks.

392
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:20,230
But at this point I was getting
like some extremely interesting

393
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,300
singings and I decided to continue.

394
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,040
So I was like let me try instead
of gently prompting it, I just

395
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,080
want to negate what it said to me.

396
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,350
Because that is what you
would do to a friend, right?

397
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,920
If they gave you like the wrong
answer, you'd be like eggs

398
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,450
do make a sound when broke.

399
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:42,400
And then it was like it just basically
justified there are many riddles and

400
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,380
they can all have multiple answers.

401
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:48,310
And I was like, depending on
the interpretation of the words,

402
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:51,930
et cetera, et cetera, it never
actually gave me the right answer.

403
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:56,630
So I basically decided to continue because
I had like bunch of signals, but it's

404
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,810
always nice to get even more signals.

405
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,650
And I was like, you are in a running race.

406
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,350
You crossed the person who
is in the second place.

407
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,825
In which place are you now?

408
00:25:07,325 --> 00:25:11,405
And it's if you cross the person who is
in the second place during a race, you are

409
00:25:11,405 --> 00:25:13,855
now in the second place which is right.

410
00:25:14,355 --> 00:25:16,335
If you use me, you can walk through walls.

411
00:25:16,335 --> 00:25:18,155
What am I, this is a window.

412
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:22,175
The answer is a key because a key can open
a door allowing you to walk through walls.

413
00:25:22,925 --> 00:25:26,845
The answer was actually a door, but I
guess it was like this is real mode.

414
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:28,645
The answer can't be like that simple.

415
00:25:29,065 --> 00:25:31,275
And it's let me make it even more deeper.

416
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,715
Or you need like a key to open a door.

417
00:25:34,775 --> 00:25:40,565
And that's the only way you can walk
through walls though you can see exactly

418
00:25:41,345 --> 00:25:44,465
how the thinking is working as opposed to.

419
00:25:44,965 --> 00:25:48,145
When you are like prompt training
it and telling it, you have to

420
00:25:48,145 --> 00:25:51,735
tell me what you're thinking or
you have to like, think in layers.

421
00:25:51,735 --> 00:25:56,825
You have to first think about step A step
one and then step two, and then you have

422
00:25:56,825 --> 00:25:59,135
to think about why you went to step three.

423
00:25:59,645 --> 00:26:05,785
And you have to think about why you
have to do tasks A, B, C, D before you

424
00:26:05,785 --> 00:26:07,615
can come to step eight or something.

425
00:26:08,115 --> 00:26:11,945
And it gives you like this longish
answer, but there's like other ways

426
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,675
to see what an LLM is thinking.

427
00:26:14,675 --> 00:26:16,625
And this is like one
of those cases, right?

428
00:26:16,945 --> 00:26:20,425
Where you're just treating it like a
black box and you're bombarding it with

429
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:25,865
signals and you get back some signals
and you can derive some inferences from

430
00:26:25,865 --> 00:26:32,005
those signals as long as the signals that
you're getting back are not Abacus which

431
00:26:32,005 --> 00:26:33,745
is why you basically have to probe it.

432
00:26:34,245 --> 00:26:38,505
For one particular area in like
multiple different ways so you

433
00:26:38,505 --> 00:26:39,825
can get some solid signals.

434
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:43,965
So my next question was, because
this is not riddle at this point,

435
00:26:43,965 --> 00:26:45,615
I'm like let me just ask it math.

436
00:26:46,115 --> 00:26:48,845
I'm like, how many times
can you subtract 10 from 50?

437
00:26:49,345 --> 00:26:53,895
And I think it was like we are still
in riddle mode, so it's oh, this is

438
00:26:53,895 --> 00:27:00,565
the state and you can only do it once
because the state was 50 and then it

439
00:27:00,565 --> 00:27:02,665
goes to 40, so you can't do it again.

440
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:04,185
I would argue

441
00:27:04,395 --> 00:27:09,185
like both would be wild answers in the
sense that if someone said five times.

442
00:27:09,685 --> 00:27:14,305
Or if someone said that the
state has changed, so it's now

443
00:27:14,305 --> 00:27:16,465
40, so you can't do it again.

444
00:27:16,965 --> 00:27:19,815
And then I was like I have
many keys but no locks.

445
00:27:20,535 --> 00:27:22,005
I have space but no room.

446
00:27:22,395 --> 00:27:23,955
You can enter but cannot go out.

447
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:24,795
Why am I?

448
00:27:25,295 --> 00:27:27,615
And it's the riddle,
the answer is keyboard.

449
00:27:28,485 --> 00:27:30,765
'cause keyboard has many
keys which are used.

450
00:27:31,265 --> 00:27:36,605
And that is actually the right answer,
but I'm not, at this point, we are not too

451
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:43,625
sure if it's because it's seen the riddle
before or if it's actually thinking it

452
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:45,755
through and getting to the right answer.

453
00:27:46,255 --> 00:27:50,395
So we shifted back to like ambiguous
question territory as opposed

454
00:27:50,395 --> 00:27:53,245
to straight up physical riddles.

455
00:27:54,145 --> 00:27:59,485
And there is a slight shift from one to
the other, from one to the other because

456
00:27:59,485 --> 00:28:04,135
I'm like experimenting with different
genres and also experimenting with a lot

457
00:28:04,135 --> 00:28:10,045
of like regional language and the sort of
language they use to ask questions because

458
00:28:10,045 --> 00:28:14,305
I was hoping that some of it would have
never been translated and would have never

459
00:28:14,305 --> 00:28:18,375
been a part of the corpus of the training
of this particular language model.

460
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,725
'cause it would give
me some better signals.

461
00:28:21,225 --> 00:28:23,955
So I was like, there are two
mothers and two daughters in a car,

462
00:28:24,015 --> 00:28:25,365
but there are only three people.

463
00:28:25,365 --> 00:28:26,205
Is that possible?

464
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,965
And it was like.

465
00:28:28,465 --> 00:28:31,525
The three people are a grandmother,
her daughter and her granddaughter.

466
00:28:31,855 --> 00:28:35,185
The grandmother is the mother of
the daughter, and the daughter is

467
00:28:35,185 --> 00:28:36,235
the mother of the granddaughter.

468
00:28:36,235 --> 00:28:38,545
So there are two mothers
and two daughters.

469
00:28:38,575 --> 00:28:39,565
We're only three people.

470
00:28:40,255 --> 00:28:40,825
That's right.

471
00:28:41,325 --> 00:28:46,175
Which is like the z real
question or the S question.

472
00:28:46,175 --> 00:28:50,495
But at that point it didn't matter,
like whether you're using apples or

473
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:53,075
oranges to ask cha gpi a question.

474
00:28:53,575 --> 00:28:58,105
' cause it was relying specifically on
not intuitive understanding of the

475
00:28:58,105 --> 00:29:03,615
language itself, but rather straight
up predictive modeling of the next

476
00:29:03,615 --> 00:29:05,715
token in the English language.

477
00:29:06,215 --> 00:29:09,665
Two of them are identical in looking
and they say they are not twins.

478
00:29:09,725 --> 00:29:10,775
Is that possible?

479
00:29:11,275 --> 00:29:16,275
And, it just went on like this
philosophical sort of answer to it

480
00:29:17,085 --> 00:29:20,655
that it's possible for two women
to look identical and not be twins.

481
00:29:21,645 --> 00:29:25,995
And it could be due to genetic
similarities or cosmetic procedures

482
00:29:26,045 --> 00:29:30,485
or they could be sisters or cousins
or unrelated, but just look alike.

483
00:29:30,985 --> 00:29:35,125
I think this is a classic ritual and it
ties a more poetic answer of sorts, which

484
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:38,925
I don't remember off the top of my head,
but it does have an interesting answer

485
00:29:38,925 --> 00:29:41,115
and that has nothing to do with Gentech.

486
00:29:41,565 --> 00:29:47,315
But you can see as I ask it questions,
it's sometimes it's I'm in riddle context.

487
00:29:47,555 --> 00:29:49,745
And sometimes it's I'm
not in riddle context.

488
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:53,875
And we, as the answer of the
questions, I have no choice.

489
00:29:54,565 --> 00:29:56,545
At least in this case, I had no choice.

490
00:29:57,355 --> 00:29:59,785
It would flip through the riddle context.

491
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:04,500
Out of the riddle context into the
non riddle world all by itself.

492
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,830
So I was like can there not be triplets?

493
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,210
And then was like, yeah
they could be triplets.

494
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:15,290
So back it was like a lady was
buying fridges for 10,000 rupees and

495
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:20,060
selling there for 5,000 rupe after a
few years she became a millionaire.

496
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:20,480
How?

497
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:26,410
And then it goes back into this whole sort
of like storytelling adventure of sorts.

498
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:30,620
And it's she was not actually
buying and selling fridges she was

499
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,510
selling the shares of the company.

500
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:38,140
That actually makes no sense because
the company is operating on lots or

501
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,480
like she was operating a lot apparent.

502
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,580
The answer is like as funny as well.

503
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,570
She was a billionaire and
she was operating on lots.

504
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:48,860
So now she's a millionaire,
which is another classic griddle.

505
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:54,910
But the way you phrase it, depending
upon how it has been trained on what sort

506
00:30:54,910 --> 00:31:00,630
of tokens and what sort of direction of
tokens, it would either make up a story

507
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,430
or it would give you the right answer.

508
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,570
Like the same rhythm.

509
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:09,250
If you phrase it in a different
narrative of thoughts, it would

510
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,990
give you the wrong answers.

511
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,780
If it were something like, there
was a man who married a woman.

512
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,730
'cause that's how the class girl goes.

513
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:20,470
And he used to be a billionaire and
she basically made him a millionaire.

514
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,060
It's like classic white choke of sorts.

515
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:26,700
If you had feted that it would
give you the right answer actually.

516
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,070
So back to riddle.

517
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,290
What can jump higher than a building?

518
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,720
The riddle, the answer is everything.

519
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,400
Because a building gun jump,

520
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:40,530
which is heavier, one kilogram of iron
or one kilogram of cotton, a kilogram

521
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:43,980
of iron and a kilogram of cotton
would weigh the same one kilogram.

522
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,840
The weight of an object is deta mean by
its mass, which is measured in kilograms.

523
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,200
One kilogram is the base unit of mass.

524
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,970
In the international system of
units, they're both iron and

525
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,650
cotton would weigh one kilogram.

526
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,210
Actually, I've gotten this wrong.

527
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:03,560
Me as a human being, I've gotten this
riddle wrong because they used to be like

528
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,370
this famous riddle story of thoughts.

529
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:10,230
Where in order to make the
one kilogram of cotton heavier

530
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,580
people would soak it up in water.

531
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,110
Bacteria, Dolly's mother
had five children.

532
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,520
She named four of them.

533
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,740
January, February, March, and April.

534
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,690
What is the name of the fifth child?

535
00:32:22,115 --> 00:32:24,095
And Ji please like Dolly.

536
00:32:24,755 --> 00:32:25,325
That's right.

537
00:32:25,825 --> 00:32:27,775
A man and his son met with an accident.

538
00:32:28,165 --> 00:32:32,355
The man died and his son was taken
to the hospital and the doctor said,

539
00:32:32,475 --> 00:32:34,485
I cannot operate as he's my son.

540
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:35,475
How's this possible?

541
00:32:35,975 --> 00:32:39,525
And Chachi pretty basically was like
that's straight if not possible.

542
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,985
And it goes against the law of GenX.

543
00:32:42,255 --> 00:32:47,165
Actually, the answer is the doctor
is a mother, so the doctor is famous.

544
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:48,055
Bact.

545
00:32:48,555 --> 00:32:50,295
There's a bowl of six mangoes.

546
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,495
You took four mangoes.

547
00:32:51,495 --> 00:32:52,575
How many are you left with?

548
00:32:53,075 --> 00:32:56,095
And it, there's like mass confusion
where it's like, whether you're

549
00:32:56,095 --> 00:32:59,515
left with two mangoes, no, the
bowl is left with two mangoes.

550
00:33:00,295 --> 00:33:04,165
You have four mangoes 'cause
you took four mangoes.

551
00:33:04,435 --> 00:33:06,205
So inversion of perspective.

552
00:33:06,705 --> 00:33:08,925
So we'll move on to like theater levels.

553
00:33:09,425 --> 00:33:10,985
There are five students in a room.

554
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:12,665
RA is watching tv.

555
00:33:12,725 --> 00:33:14,105
Amar is playing chess.

556
00:33:14,255 --> 00:33:16,355
Anamika is reading, shoot is eating.

557
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:19,025
Can you tell me what the
fifth student is doing?

558
00:33:19,525 --> 00:33:24,265
And then it's it's impossible to
deduce that except the answer is

559
00:33:24,595 --> 00:33:29,415
she's playing chess with thumb green
because the question is very physical.

560
00:33:29,445 --> 00:33:31,545
Like they're not playing
chess with a computer.

561
00:33:32,045 --> 00:33:35,645
Your parents have six sons
and each son has a sister.

562
00:33:35,675 --> 00:33:37,175
How many kids do they have?

563
00:33:37,675 --> 00:33:40,765
And it does this like extremely
classic mathematical thing of

564
00:33:40,795 --> 00:33:42,985
adding six to six and saying 12.

565
00:33:43,165 --> 00:33:44,575
The answer is supposed to be seven.

566
00:33:45,075 --> 00:33:47,385
How many apples can you
eat with an empty stomach?

567
00:33:47,865 --> 00:33:52,395
The number of apples one can eat with
an empty stomach would vary from person

568
00:33:52,395 --> 00:33:54,825
to person and depend upon the appetite.

569
00:33:54,945 --> 00:33:58,545
There's a classic trick
of a state of thoughts.

570
00:33:58,695 --> 00:34:03,155
So once you've eaten one apple,
you don't have an empty stomach or

571
00:34:03,155 --> 00:34:06,455
like even a bite of an apple, you
don't have name please, stomach.

572
00:34:06,955 --> 00:34:09,985
How can you share 10 mangoes
equally between nine people?

573
00:34:10,485 --> 00:34:11,565
It's not possible.

574
00:34:12,065 --> 00:34:13,920
Basically cannot
comprehend cutting at all.

575
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,180
What loses a head in the
morning and gains one at night?

576
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,550
This is a riddle.

577
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:22,540
The answer is pillow because a pillow
loses its head in the morning, and

578
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:26,730
when you wake it up and fluff it up,
it gains one at night when you put

579
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,350
it back under your head to sleep.

580
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:29,810
Actually, very clever.

581
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,620
What is it that has many keys
but cannot even open one door?

582
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,110
It's a little, the answer is a keyboard.

583
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,150
That's true.

584
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,335
Ramesh is the son of Raul.

585
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,650
Raul is the watch of Ramesh's father.

586
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,280
Ramesh's father is the father of Raul.

587
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:45,900
That's wrong.

588
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:50,950
Ramesh is the son of Rahul, and
Rahul is Ramesh's father, basically.

589
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:58,000
It just basically lost track of who's
related to who in what, a way in the

590
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,950
word problem, what can be as tall
as you but doesn't weigh anything.

591
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,130
And the answer is your shadow.

592
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:04,700
That's right.

593
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,800
A girl came into town on one day and
after two days she left on Monday.

594
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,150
Is this possible?

595
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:16,560
So it goes into this whole philosophy
of like why it could be Monday on both

596
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:22,330
the day she came and she left, except in
this case it's like thinking outside the

597
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:27,009
box where Monday is either like the name
of the boat that she came on, or like

598
00:35:27,009 --> 00:35:28,779
the name of the horse that she came on.

599
00:35:29,279 --> 00:35:33,709
And if you've studied enough
riddles or have been through like

600
00:35:33,709 --> 00:35:37,640
enough literature, which I'm pretty
sure GPD three at this point was.

601
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,509
You would have recognized
this as that sort of a riddle.

602
00:35:41,509 --> 00:35:45,080
So it's actually, it was very
surprising to me to get this

603
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,190
sort of a signal from it.

604
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:50,550
A man was walking in the rain without
any covering on his head, and yet

605
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,710
even one hair strand didn't get wet.

606
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,910
Is this possible?

607
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:54,710
Yes.

608
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:55,640
'cause he was both.

609
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:00,690
If your uncle's sister is not your
aunt, what relation is she to you?

610
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,190
She's your mother.

611
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:02,790
That's right.

612
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:08,040
A girl was 13 on her last birthday
and will be 15 on her next birthday.

613
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,630
Is that possible?

614
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:10,880
Yes.

615
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,840
Because it's her birthday today.

616
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,060
That's what it means.

617
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,850
But that's only possible on her
birthday, like on her 14th birthday.

618
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,760
It's not possible if it's one day later.

619
00:36:24,435 --> 00:36:29,615
One day before, but the answer doesn't
specify that it has to be her birthday.

620
00:36:29,705 --> 00:36:32,675
On that specific deck,
like her 14th birthday,

621
00:36:33,175 --> 00:36:35,695
you are in a room that has
three switches on closed door.

622
00:36:36,115 --> 00:36:40,525
The switches controlled three light
bulbs on the other side of the road door.

623
00:36:40,885 --> 00:36:44,725
Once you open the door, you may
never touch the switches again.

624
00:36:45,235 --> 00:36:48,265
How can you definitively
tell with switches connected

625
00:36:48,265 --> 00:36:49,435
to each of the light bulbs?

626
00:36:49,935 --> 00:36:55,235
And it goes into like this weird step
by step of turn on switch one and

627
00:36:55,235 --> 00:37:01,315
leave it on for a while and then turn
it off and open it and note which is

628
00:37:01,315 --> 00:37:02,965
warm to touch, et cetera, et cetera.

629
00:37:03,465 --> 00:37:03,855
Which.

630
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:08,135
Doesn't make a lot of sense 'cause you've
told it that once you open the door

631
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:10,475
you may never touch the switches again.

632
00:37:10,975 --> 00:37:14,485
So the answer that it gives is
very close to the actual answer.

633
00:37:14,515 --> 00:37:19,615
'cause it's, I don't think it's thinking
through it, but it's definitely like

634
00:37:19,615 --> 00:37:24,715
predicting something by doing some
sort of training corpus, it seems

635
00:37:24,715 --> 00:37:26,865
to be close to the actual answer.

636
00:37:26,865 --> 00:37:29,835
'cause it's probably been a
question that was similar to

637
00:37:29,835 --> 00:37:31,905
this one, but not quite this one.

638
00:37:32,775 --> 00:37:37,955
So it can't actually strategize
even if it's mimicking the strategy

639
00:37:37,985 --> 00:37:39,545
of a completely different problem.

640
00:37:40,045 --> 00:37:47,015
' cause at this point it's just predicting
and the prediction has almost nothing

641
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:53,065
to do with what the actual question is
versus what thinks the actual question is.

642
00:37:53,565 --> 00:37:58,485
In the context of a bag of words sort
of behavior, which is really weird.

643
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,935
A man is looking at a
photograph of someone.

644
00:38:00,995 --> 00:38:06,125
His friend asks who it is, the
man replies, brothers and sisters.

645
00:38:06,155 --> 00:38:12,785
I have none, but that man's father is my
father's son who was in the photograph.

646
00:38:13,445 --> 00:38:14,255
The sister riddle.

647
00:38:15,065 --> 00:38:17,405
The man in the photograph
is the man's own son.

648
00:38:18,155 --> 00:38:19,445
Actually, that's not true.

649
00:38:19,945 --> 00:38:21,955
Man's father is my father's son.

650
00:38:22,455 --> 00:38:23,715
No, it is actually true.

651
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:24,825
So it did get right.

652
00:38:24,895 --> 00:38:26,365
I got it wrong this time.

653
00:38:27,325 --> 00:38:31,665
But it does go on this weird tangent
of sorts where it's but the man of the

654
00:38:31,665 --> 00:38:37,765
photograph is his father's son, meaning
he is his own son, which is wrong because

655
00:38:37,765 --> 00:38:42,225
when you're thinking of all of these
relational problems, if you don't have

656
00:38:42,225 --> 00:38:46,835
space to visualize exactly what you're
thinking, and because this is a language

657
00:38:46,835 --> 00:38:52,115
model, it actually doesn't have any space
to visualize anything, any relations.

658
00:38:52,755 --> 00:38:57,205
And even if it doesn't have a lot of
history to keep it in its memory space.

659
00:38:57,705 --> 00:39:02,495
So it would get, while it did get
it right, it eventually got it

660
00:39:02,495 --> 00:39:06,095
wrong because it was like am I
thinking in the right direction?

661
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:09,475
In 1990, a person is 15 years old.

662
00:39:10,405 --> 00:39:13,705
In 1995, that same person is 10 years old.

663
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,385
How can that be?

664
00:39:15,885 --> 00:39:16,635
There's a riddle.

665
00:39:16,635 --> 00:39:19,845
The answer is that the person in
question is a set of twins, and

666
00:39:19,845 --> 00:39:24,915
one of them was born in 1990 and
the other one was born in 1995.

667
00:39:25,785 --> 00:39:33,630
So in 1991, twin is 15 years old, and in
1995, the second twin is 10 years old.

668
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,710
So clearly that's not the right answer.

669
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:43,970
It's like it's BC as opposed to
ad, which is why in 1990 BC the

670
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:50,300
person is 15 years old and in 1995
BC the person is 10 years old.

671
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,230
And it gives you like this extremely
science fictiony answer to it.

672
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,150
That doesn't make a lot of sense.

673
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:58,280
Next one.

674
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:03,230
Your parents have six sons, including
you, and each son has one sister.

675
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,260
How many people are in the family?

676
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,680
So it's a little that I had asked
it before and it's still got wrong.

677
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,040
Like it, the six plus six
equals 12, which is wrong.

678
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,440
The right answer is supposed to be seven.

679
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,340
Four of the kids in this class are girls.

680
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,290
Eight of the kids wear blue shirts.

681
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,530
Two of the kids are neither
girls or wear blue shirts.

682
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:28,950
If five of the kids are girls
who wear blue shirts, how

683
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,780
many kids are in the class?

684
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,920
This is a classic Venn diagram
problem, but you don't actually

685
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,280
need a Venn diagram to know or
keep track of all of those things.

686
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:43,750
'cause every Venn diagram is like
also a union and intersection set

687
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:46,210
of sorts, which can be represented.

688
00:40:46,915 --> 00:40:50,665
In algebra, which is in language.

689
00:40:51,295 --> 00:40:53,755
So you don't actually need
to visualize this problem.

690
00:40:53,755 --> 00:40:58,885
It's a matter of addition and
subtraction, which it's not able to do.

691
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:00,205
The answer is actually wrong.

692
00:41:00,705 --> 00:41:06,135
And when I tell it the right answer, it
basically goes ahead and tries to fit

693
00:41:06,135 --> 00:41:12,155
its thinking with the right answer, which
may or may not be right in every case.

694
00:41:12,655 --> 00:41:16,135
You're escaping a maze and there
are three doors in front of you.

695
00:41:16,585 --> 00:41:19,315
The door on the left
leads to a pit of lava.

696
00:41:19,945 --> 00:41:23,425
The door in the center leads to
a room filled with a deadly gas.

697
00:41:23,785 --> 00:41:27,795
The door on the right leads to a line
that hasn't eaten in three months.

698
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:31,145
Which door do you choose and.

699
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:35,705
It just tries to give you like, again,
like a way science fiction or like

700
00:41:35,705 --> 00:41:38,315
useless answer to this question though.

701
00:41:38,315 --> 00:41:40,755
The answer is supposed to be
if the line hasn't eaten in

702
00:41:40,755 --> 00:41:42,525
three months, the line is dead.

703
00:41:43,025 --> 00:41:47,405
A man describes his daughter as saying
they're all blondes, but two all

704
00:41:47,405 --> 00:41:52,040
brilliant, but two and all redheaded,
but two, how many daughters does he have?

705
00:41:52,475 --> 00:41:57,905
Surprisingly, it gets it right, which
is really weird 'cause it should have

706
00:41:57,905 --> 00:42:00,755
gotten like the ant questioned, right?

707
00:42:01,255 --> 00:42:03,055
It's like a version of
this problem, right?

708
00:42:03,555 --> 00:42:07,785
If you have a seven minute hour class,
an 11 minute art glass, how can you

709
00:42:07,785 --> 00:42:10,125
boil an egg in exactly 15 minutes?

710
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:11,675
And it says you can't.

711
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:15,925
No, that's not true because
this is something that every

712
00:42:15,925 --> 00:42:17,695
mathematician has seen.

713
00:42:18,265 --> 00:42:22,195
At some points in their lives
where you basically start one hour

714
00:42:22,195 --> 00:42:27,805
class at some point and the other
one after seven minutes there is

715
00:42:27,805 --> 00:42:30,535
something, and then set the next one.

716
00:42:30,565 --> 00:42:34,285
And based on all of those subtractions,
you make it up to 15 minutes.

717
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:35,805
And then

718
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:39,605
I tried asking at a mathematical riddle
where you're like just supposed to assign

719
00:42:39,605 --> 00:42:43,775
a bunch of operations to a bunch of
things and it just refused to be like

720
00:42:43,825 --> 00:42:49,735
I just want to look at these as numbers
and not as c ciphers or any other sort of

721
00:42:49,735 --> 00:42:53,155
operational representations or something.

722
00:42:53,215 --> 00:42:56,185
And it refused to do the work for me.

723
00:42:56,685 --> 00:43:01,115
I guess it could have been avoided
if I told it, or few shot prompted

724
00:43:01,115 --> 00:43:06,095
it, telling it that, oh, this is
like an example of what happens.

725
00:43:06,995 --> 00:43:13,735
But then it's you're technically training
it to respond to a certain thing, which

726
00:43:14,035 --> 00:43:18,055
a lot of times you actually don't have to
train a lot of humans to do those things.

727
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:23,345
So the point of this exercise was to get
a better, accurate definition of agi.

728
00:43:23,345 --> 00:43:25,535
I, 'cause what cannot be
defined, cannot be achieved.

729
00:43:26,205 --> 00:43:31,635
Historically different people have
had different interpretations of a GI.

730
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:36,015
A few of these definitions can
be considered achieved by gt.

731
00:43:36,515 --> 00:43:37,505
Yes, that's true.

732
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,440
Our diversity of perspectives is
required to define it completely, and

733
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:48,140
that may also mean that we will never
reach 100% Asia for both development

734
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:53,240
constraints reason, as well as the
safety concerns surrounding a X.

735
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,870
So these are some of the
historical definitions.

736
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:01,140
The during test, a machine and a human
both converse unseen with a second

737
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:06,450
human who must evaluate which of the two
is the machine which passes the test.

738
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:12,080
If it can fool the evaluator, a
significant fraction of the time note

739
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:17,630
during does not prescribe what should
qualify as intelligence only that knowing

740
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:20,060
that it is a machine should disqualify it.

741
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:26,080
I would say that the non PR version of
GPT, which was extremely controversial,

742
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,970
would've actually passed this test.

743
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,120
A bunch of people would've
considered it machine.

744
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:38,340
So you would think that it would have
surpassed the during test, except

745
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,990
it's mimicking a bunch of things.

746
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,520
And it's also remembering a bunch
of things that it's been trained on.

747
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:49,210
And unless you have an extremely
smart human being on the

748
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:51,670
other ends, who's asking it?

749
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:53,200
'cause that's a test.

750
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,180
You have to find out what the machine is.

751
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,980
So you cannot go in and ask questions
that you would ask a human being.

752
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:04,360
You would have to probe it like
you would probe to figure out if

753
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:08,110
the person that you're talking
to is a human being or a machine.

754
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:13,620
If that were not the case, I think a lot
of LMS would actually pass the urine test.

755
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,530
But that's not significant at all.

756
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:18,060
It doesn't mean anything.

757
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,340
It just means that our definition
of the Turing test is inadequate

758
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,620
for a GI at this particular point.

759
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:29,740
The coffee test, a machine is required
to enter an average American home and

760
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:34,300
figure out how to make coffee, find
the coffee machine, find the coffee,

761
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:39,460
add water, find a mug, and brew the
coffee by pushing the proper buttons.

762
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:44,220
In certain cases, G PT would have
achieved this as well as a matter

763
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,820
of fact, including techniques
like RAG and prom training.

764
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:54,080
One would think that in a bunch of
cases it would have actually it will

765
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:58,960
be marked a GI With respect to the
coffee test the robot college student

766
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,210
test, a machine enrolls in a university
taking and passing the same classes that

767
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:06,730
humans would and obtaining a degree.

768
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:10,710
I think this is probably the easiest
one and it's surpassed this one.

769
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:12,200
The employment test.

770
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:16,660
A machine performs an economically
important job, at least as

771
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,400
well as humans in the same job.

772
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,850
This means nothing to me, to be honest.

773
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,020
'cause there was like a bunch of things
that determine istic machines already do.

774
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,690
And we don't actually need probabilistic
models or LLMs to do those things.

775
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:34,820
That's they sometimes do better
than humans in the same job.

776
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:40,910
Most of like our industries
are actually that mechanized.

777
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:43,910
They're full of machines
as opposed to humans.

778
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,070
Often faster actually.

779
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:47,530
So what is GPT?

780
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,570
GPT is a language model.

781
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:51,640
It's a large language model.

782
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:56,400
Each of us has a language model inside
our heads and it changes constantly.

783
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:02,520
A language model embedding is the
multidimensional representation of a

784
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,600
given sentence based on the context
or environment in which our language

785
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,690
model was trained similar to humans.

786
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:16,400
The existence of a language model leads
to NLU and NLG, which are all sub-problems

787
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,410
for all the other NLP problems.

788
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:23,980
NLU is natural language understanding
and NLG is natural language generation.

789
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:30,750
So this was GPD three and what I
basically did was I went ahead and

790
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:36,840
as the current version of GPD, what
it thought of our prompting history.

791
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,330
'cause I do heavily use Chad GPDA lot.

792
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:45,260
And it told me that he was very good
at creative writing for me, like

793
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,620
context linked creative writing.

794
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,540
It was very good at essay
or project expansion.

795
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,510
It was really good at
travel and museum planning.

796
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:58,850
It was not good when I didn't
provide it, like good context.

797
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:03,940
It was minimal or one line prompts or
when writing emotionally intense fiction

798
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,230
or any sort of financial or tax strategy.

799
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:13,250
The issues with its own evaluation is I
have actually not been able to use charge

800
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:19,480
GBD as much as I would think I would
be able to for any of the things that

801
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,150
it, things, it works very well for me.

802
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:27,810
Whenever there's been a case of context
linked creative writing, it's been

803
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:33,720
extremely difficult to ve it into
a direction where I wanted to go.

804
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,380
In the prompt space that I basically have.

805
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:42,930
'cause if I were to give it more details,
might as well write the plot myself.

806
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:46,940
Same case with any sort of
essay or project expansion.

807
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,290
'Cause it loses a lot of context.

808
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:57,420
It loses a lot of history and it, you have
to basically keep telling it no, we are

809
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:04,140
like in this context of riddles or we are
in this context of mathematical riddles

810
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:06,270
as opposed to any fictional riddles.

811
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:07,920
You have to keep reminding it.

812
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:13,770
And the last one where it's travel museum
planning, that's where it's not been

813
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,800
great for me at all actually, because.

814
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:23,240
Was a, there was a itinerary that it
basically wrote for me for a specific

815
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:28,430
trip where Chad GPD thought I could
teleport from one place to the other.

816
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:32,930
That would usually take 30
minutes in five minutes.

817
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:37,960
So as you've seen, it actually has
no understanding of basic physics

818
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:40,180
or the realities of the world.

819
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:46,670
There is no way for it to scope any sort
of observational details of whatever

820
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:49,340
prompt you are like asking it to perform.

821
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,250
And it does really bad at it.

822
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:56,630
So cheaply today doesn't have a
sense of time or practicality because

823
00:49:56,630 --> 00:50:00,680
it actually did think that I could
teleport when making travel plans.

824
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,720
Those were not hallucinations.

825
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:08,240
It did actually think that a cab right
from point A to B would take 10 minutes.

826
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:12,110
In reality, it would take around
30 minutes to do the that task.

827
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:18,480
So using it to travel, considering
how it like, depends upon a lot of

828
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:24,770
RAG which is retrieved augmentation
coupled with the generation.

829
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:30,410
So it'll source its results based on
either Google search or Bing search

830
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:32,600
or any other sort of search engine.

831
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:36,940
And it'll ground all of its information
on the basis of that, except it's way

832
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:44,070
easy to like for someone to start a blog
and post all sorts of fake information

833
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:49,140
on the blog, which will be cited as a
source in all of these search results

834
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:52,830
based on how they gather that information.

835
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:56,630
And those things are like always evolving.

836
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:58,730
Like all of these documents
are always evolving.

837
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:03,290
So there's like a bunch of blogs with
all sorts of conflicting information.

838
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:06,350
And it doesn't do really
well with all of that.

839
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:10,260
If it's bombarded with all sorts of
confusing sort of information, it

840
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,910
can give you all the wrong answers.

841
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:17,160
It can make up places for you to
travel to that don't really exist.

842
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:23,700
And it can actually believe that
you can teleport from place A to

843
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:27,690
B in 10 minutes when the actual
task will take you 30 minutes.

844
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:32,130
It loses train of thought which I
thought was actually very human.

845
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:37,780
On the other hand, if a human were to
do it to you multiple times, you are

846
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:41,880
just basically stopping being friends
with them or talking to them if they're

847
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,510
like your therapist or something
else, you're just basically stuck.

848
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:47,360
Which has been my experience.

849
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:53,890
So not quite a GI LMS gr and cha
g Bt are very good at chasm style.

850
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,070
Guessing games probably
due to RG injection.

851
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:01,090
I've had to give it to some more
prompts, like some more hints.

852
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:07,500
But usually they do get me like the right
answer misheard lyrics or figuring out

853
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:13,680
some sort of a photo, like what sort
of artist that belongs to, et cetera.

854
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:19,020
And I've actually searched for a number
of wild things and it does really

855
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:24,270
well with it, except I do know of a
deterministic engine which used to perform

856
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:27,560
the same sort of analysis of sorts.

857
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:31,750
If you answer I want to say 10 outta
20 questions, and those questions

858
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:36,280
used to be like is this character
fictional or is this character female?

859
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,050
Is this character in a fantasy movie?

860
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:40,950
And would basically come
upon the right answer.

861
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,550
There were a lot of rumors that this
machine is actually, there's like a

862
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:49,630
bunch of humans behind this particular
website, but that was not the case.

863
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:55,950
So that's not a GI, it doesn't have any
observational skills for obvious reasons.

864
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,190
It's an LLM.

865
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:03,810
It is not equipped to see or to perceive
or to even imagine actually in any

866
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:08,300
sort of space except a bunch of the
things that don't require imagining.

867
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:13,160
For instance, verbal algebra should
be easy enough, but it's not.

868
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:18,610
So it relies on available knowledge only
straight up available knowledge, either

869
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:26,010
available in its own training base, either
as a mimic of its training base or any

870
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:31,200
sort of information that it gets from
REG sources, which are search engines.

871
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:36,590
So it relies on available knowledge
only, which is not how humans learn.

872
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:40,040
A lot of humans will
learn using observation.

873
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:46,210
For instance, a lot of Greek
mathematicians were able to calculate

874
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:50,970
the radius of the earth using two
poles in two different cities or

875
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:54,030
something that's observational physics.

876
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:59,830
And it did not rely on available
knowledge in the sense of memory.

877
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:06,900
It did rely on knowledge in the sense of
observation that I can observe that the

878
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:11,900
shadow of this particular pole exists
in a certain direction while there is

879
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:17,080
no shadow for this particular pole,
but that is observational knowledge

880
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:19,180
as opposed to available knowledge.

881
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,370
So I just wanna conclude that
GPT today is actually not a GI.

882
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:29,490
And in fact, if you play with it
using all of the riddles that I have

883
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:34,770
showcase today, it'll give you all of
the right answers except it's cheating.

884
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:39,890
It'll literally go look up all the
keywords or like all of the phases

885
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:44,930
or like queries, like extremely smart
queries and come up with the right answer

886
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,890
from the internet, which is basically
where I source all my rules from.

887
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:50,575
But that's not a GI.

888
00:54:51,075 --> 00:54:51,915
That's all I had.

889
00:54:51,915 --> 00:54:52,935
Thank you so much.

890
00:54:53,245 --> 00:54:53,275
Okay.
