00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:00,830
Hi.

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:01,760
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,460
Myself, Hamdi.

4
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,570
I'm a senior mobile developer
slash like a mobile architect.

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,080
Today's my topic is securing
healthcare at scale dev DevOps

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,729
for critical patient platforms.

7
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,249
So as a mobile architect overeducated
in health technology have navigated

8
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,499
the complex intersections of security.

9
00:00:22,964 --> 00:00:27,004
Complaints and patient safety while
building platforms that solves like

10
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:31,954
millions of patients across cancer
centers and different organizations,

11
00:00:31,954 --> 00:00:33,545
health organizations nationwide.

12
00:00:34,114 --> 00:00:39,035
This presentation says how we
implemented DevSecOps for my story.

13
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:44,175
So this application is a award-winning
trademark mobile health and cancer.

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,490
Cancer patients like a
symptom tracking application.

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,500
So this platform supporting active
clinical trials at institutions.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,129
So the stakes of healthcare security.

17
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,660
So generally in the health technology,
the stakes are immensely high.

18
00:01:00,245 --> 00:01:03,694
The security failures aren't
merely embarrassing incidents.

19
00:01:03,754 --> 00:01:08,085
So if you take any examples, there
are lot of security failures.

20
00:01:08,595 --> 00:01:12,105
So they are direct threats to
patient lives and public trust.

21
00:01:12,135 --> 00:01:15,375
So whenever there is something
happened in the healthcare industry

22
00:01:15,615 --> 00:01:17,475
that might affect a lot of patients.

23
00:01:17,775 --> 00:01:20,345
So consider this critical
chain a patient's.

24
00:01:20,395 --> 00:01:26,214
Chemotherapy remain relies impact fully
implicitly precise data transmission.

25
00:01:26,725 --> 00:01:31,925
So the integrity of lifesaving clinical
trials results in based on the data,

26
00:01:31,954 --> 00:01:37,294
what we data, what kind of data we
selected, what kind of data we got, and

27
00:01:37,294 --> 00:01:40,975
deeply personal information there in
the healthcare applications as we know.

28
00:01:41,745 --> 00:01:46,665
So in this landscape, very in the
landscape, the very concept of

29
00:01:46,665 --> 00:01:48,905
margin for error is eradicated.

30
00:01:49,115 --> 00:01:53,305
So the small error like affect a
lot of patients information the

31
00:01:53,305 --> 00:01:55,405
PA data leakage, those things.

32
00:01:55,855 --> 00:02:00,195
So we have to take care of all the
security things considerable rely on

33
00:02:00,195 --> 00:02:02,715
that traditional security para paradigms.

34
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,990
Where the safeguards are related to
the final predeployment checkpoint.

35
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,620
It's not just a it is not
just in the intake industry.

36
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:15,020
It's it is dangerously absolute
for a security is not a future.

37
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,530
It's like foundation upon which
digital health solution must be built.

38
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:25,029
Like when we like building the application
we considered all these security concerns.

39
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:27,109
What kind of PI data is there?

40
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:28,399
What kind of information?

41
00:02:28,429 --> 00:02:32,559
We have to be secure while
releasing the stores.

42
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:36,495
DevSecOps represent a paradigm script.

43
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:38,705
So basically it's it's not just a process.

44
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:41,885
It's like a profound culture
and operational transformation.

45
00:02:42,635 --> 00:02:46,715
So strategically integrating
security into every facet of

46
00:02:46,715 --> 00:02:48,155
healthcare technology lifecycle.

47
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:52,925
So this means proactively emit a
robust security measures directly

48
00:02:52,925 --> 00:02:56,740
into the development phase for example
modeling, securing design principles

49
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,300
throughout the con continuous,
static and dynamic code analysis.

50
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,460
With automated CSD pipelines catching
vulnerabilities, long before deployment.

51
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:11,340
So basically when we like deploy the
applications in the DevSecOps, we are

52
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,670
like putting like a security scans
using Soner, Google or some other tools.

53
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,260
So we scan all the application we'll
try to find like a, before releasing

54
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,265
the application, we'll try to find
where are the loopholes, where are the.

55
00:03:23,815 --> 00:03:25,925
Security security gaps are there.

56
00:03:26,015 --> 00:03:31,435
We identify by using these gaps, like
operations are deeply infused in security

57
00:03:31,465 --> 00:03:36,375
places like involving cons, constant
monitoring, automated compliance checks,

58
00:03:36,645 --> 00:03:41,595
proactive vulnerability management, and
redefined incident response strategies.

59
00:03:42,315 --> 00:03:46,074
So ensure all unparalleled
systems readability ultimately.

60
00:03:46,774 --> 00:03:50,764
District Cups cultivates a shared
responsible across all teams.

61
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,604
So generally, like when we develop, like
we have a frontend team, backend team

62
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:59,814
all the other teams are there so we have
to consider like each place where all

63
00:03:59,814 --> 00:04:04,995
the teams are working what are the gaps
what kind of security, what kind of like

64
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,125
sensitive patient data we have to be.

65
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,899
Critical care to be considerable, we
have to take care of all those things.

66
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:17,699
So this day, historical approach ensures
resilience, trust, and is standards

67
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:22,125
of patient safety in a constant
evolving threat landscape generally.

68
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,075
The scammers are there, lot of scammers.

69
00:04:24,075 --> 00:04:25,680
Everybody's trying to steal the data.

70
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:30,335
With the data like whatever data,
like for example, if we use any

71
00:04:30,575 --> 00:04:34,830
patient information those things
like might affect in the industry.

72
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,160
So we have to take care exactly
what data we are collecting.

73
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,560
We have to give security for
the trust purpose for this.

74
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,860
Patients also need to be like very
confident on the application before using.

75
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,530
So this is healthcare security landscape.

76
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,800
So first one is like a
regulatory complexity.

77
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,235
So when we EPA establish the EPA
establishes baseline requirements,

78
00:04:58,505 --> 00:05:01,914
but clinical trade introduce
FDA oversight state level

79
00:05:01,914 --> 00:05:03,984
regulations, add another layer.

80
00:05:04,044 --> 00:05:06,925
So basically on top of hip, we
are adding another layer for

81
00:05:06,925 --> 00:05:08,395
international institutions.

82
00:05:08,445 --> 00:05:12,455
Introduce, gDP are considerations also,
like for the international use, we are

83
00:05:12,455 --> 00:05:14,435
using the other considerations also.

84
00:05:15,155 --> 00:05:19,385
So our attack surface also data is
uniquely vulnerable to attackers.

85
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:24,035
Medical records sell for far more than
credit card numbers because they contain

86
00:05:24,035 --> 00:05:25,715
information that can't be changed.

87
00:05:26,105 --> 00:05:28,745
So because of this we have to be careful.

88
00:05:29,135 --> 00:05:31,265
So the third one is patient safety.

89
00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:32,515
Like when we build anything.

90
00:05:32,545 --> 00:05:35,675
So we have to take care of,
security failures can directly

91
00:05:35,675 --> 00:05:40,125
harm patients incorrect medication
diagnosis missed appointments or

92
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,905
delayed treatment represent security
failures with physical consequences.

93
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:49,680
So these are the three things we have to
be consider while we develop anything.

94
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,210
So this is like a mobile health
expands the attack service.

95
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,760
So data moves between patient
devices and cloud infrastructure.

96
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,680
Generally like a patient
enter the information by

97
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,600
using like a TPS or anything.

98
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,650
We just exchange the data between
that whatever database cloud

99
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:09,200
architecture we use those things
we do generally does, right?

100
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,360
So those things like a patient data should
be like, very we have to like encrypt

101
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,070
all the patient data, whatever we use,
so they connect unru networks that may

102
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,860
have another application with permissions
that could access sensitive data.

103
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,050
So we have to be careful whenever
we access, like Unru networks, the

104
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,290
offline requirements of healthcare
applications add complexity.

105
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,250
Patients need to access their health
information even without connectivity.

106
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,490
Hospitals with poor
representation reception.

107
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,940
During travel or rural areas.

108
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,740
So the mobile offline is
one of the other challenge.

109
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,880
So basically we, for this we
can come up with zero zero trust

110
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,370
architecture t as a parameter.

111
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,590
So first we choose like a multi-pack,
multi-factor authentication.

112
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,390
So in initial patient development
requires MF aide with the verified

113
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:04,490
health system credentials, patient
don't reply simply create accounts.

114
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,820
They have provision through
secure enrollment process.

115
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,480
For example when you create account we.

116
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:14,055
We have all this authentication
to some other things we develop.

117
00:07:14,205 --> 00:07:19,565
So device binding after authentication,
we crypto ly bind patient's identity to

118
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:24,540
their specific device, prevent credentials
trip from immediate compromising access.

119
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:29,245
So this is like device binding is one
of the other security, we can build

120
00:07:29,335 --> 00:07:31,365
on top of multifactor authentication.

121
00:07:31,965 --> 00:07:34,455
And the third one is like
a biometric authentication.

122
00:07:34,485 --> 00:07:39,540
So by using fingerprints or face id by
these two things, we will add another

123
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,330
authentication for the enrolled devices.

124
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,780
Fourth one is like
continuous verification.

125
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,130
So generally by using tokens,
every 15 minutes, 10 minutes,

126
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,420
the token will refresh.

127
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,230
So if the application aid is
ideal, the lifetime of the

128
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,290
application will automatically
kill that particular session.

129
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,240
If they want, again, they have to log in.

130
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,220
So these four things we'll
consider for the security.

131
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,890
So this is end-to-end
encryption architecture.

132
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,840
So the data centric security.

133
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,760
So first one is device encryption.

134
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,350
So as I told device encryption before,
leaving a patient device data encrypted,

135
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:17,940
so that transit protection, encrypted
transmission with certificate pending.

136
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:23,815
So the certificate winning is another
concept for the data data encryption.

137
00:08:24,085 --> 00:08:28,174
So storage, security encrypted address
with the hierarchical key management.

138
00:08:28,635 --> 00:08:30,465
The fourth one is authorized access.

139
00:08:30,505 --> 00:08:32,845
So decryption only
authorized devices can do.

140
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,630
So this way, the before sending
the data this way, this is the

141
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,770
encryption decryption method we use
to secure the patient information.

142
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:46,100
So the key DevSecOps implementation,
so first one is end-to-end encryption.

143
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,910
So the zero trust architecture
with Oracle Key management and

144
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,320
device planning is the first thing.

145
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,810
Second thing is automated
security testing.

146
00:08:54,095 --> 00:08:57,935
So CIDC, CICD pipelines with
static analysis, dependency

147
00:08:57,935 --> 00:08:59,465
scanning, and dynamic testing.

148
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:03,755
So these are three things we can do
and do automative security testing.

149
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:05,165
So offline fast design.

150
00:09:05,215 --> 00:09:10,800
So secure local storage with the conflict
resolution and data integrity controls.

151
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,850
So this is the third step.

152
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,635
The fourth step is compliance as a code.

153
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:19,820
So automated validations of IPA MDA
are other regulatory requirements

154
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,960
that we have to be considered.

155
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,480
So fourth one is real time monitoring.

156
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,900
So continuous security monitoring
with automated instance response

157
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,620
we have to be considered.

158
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,870
So these are the five key
implementations we have d we consider.

159
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,870
So the other one is automate.

160
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,345
So the automating compliance
infrastructure as a code.

161
00:09:37,955 --> 00:09:40,995
So healthcare regulations feel
like immovable constraints,

162
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:43,425
so they dev a cup inwards.

163
00:09:43,425 --> 00:09:47,615
This relationship treating complaints
as a dynamic requirements that

164
00:09:47,825 --> 00:09:49,775
automation can continuously verify.

165
00:09:50,105 --> 00:09:54,995
So the IPA requirements as a IPA requires
a encryption that rest in translate.

166
00:09:55,505 --> 00:09:59,145
Our infrastructure code
enforces this by refusing.

167
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,750
To proven storage of network without
appropriate encryption configurations.

168
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,860
So generally as a policy, as a core
tools validate infrastructure, agonistic

169
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,680
complaints, requirements before the
application deployment, attempting

170
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,440
to deploy database without encryption
triggers immediate rejection with

171
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,500
clear explanation of which complaints
requirement would be violated.

172
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:22,145
So these things we will
do as part of the process.

173
00:10:22,645 --> 00:10:25,345
So this is the layers of the CICD.

174
00:10:26,245 --> 00:10:29,545
So first one is we'll do
like a static analysis.

175
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,675
The static analysis.

176
00:10:30,675 --> 00:10:33,995
We analyze the code the catches,
like a hard coded credentials

177
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:35,694
and also the skill injection.

178
00:10:35,744 --> 00:10:38,824
Any crypto insecure
implementation we will find.

179
00:10:39,124 --> 00:10:40,924
Second one is dependency scanning.

180
00:10:41,134 --> 00:10:44,704
So in the dependency scanning, we
will check like every third party.

181
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:46,534
Library for known vulnerabilities.

182
00:10:46,634 --> 00:10:49,454
If there is any vulnerabilities,
we will block the deployment.

183
00:10:49,754 --> 00:10:51,134
Third one is dynamic testing.

184
00:10:51,164 --> 00:10:54,014
So dynamic testing, stimulus
attacks, organized running

185
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:57,224
applications, so authentication,
bypass, and authentication.

186
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:58,304
Failures will test.

187
00:10:58,694 --> 00:11:00,314
Fourth one is container scanning.

188
00:11:00,314 --> 00:11:02,854
So we'll scan the containers
based on the images.

189
00:11:02,854 --> 00:11:04,219
Verified security best practices.

190
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:06,559
And fifth one is a p security.

191
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:11,949
So part of the backend APIs, we will test
the unauthorized access and rate limit.

192
00:11:11,949 --> 00:11:13,869
So we will check all those things.

193
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:16,259
Offline first, architecture challenges.

194
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,109
So these are the, some challenges
for the offline first mobile

195
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:20,669
development architecture.

196
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:23,389
So secure local storage.

197
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:26,509
So full device encryption as
a base baseline production.

198
00:11:26,989 --> 00:11:28,494
So this is the one, first one.

199
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:31,649
So application level encryption
required for with the keys

200
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,509
derived from patient credentials.

201
00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:38,309
So secure element integration
and hard hardware protected keys.

202
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:42,119
Also, we have to implement, so
biometric authentication, the other one.

203
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:47,479
So conflict resolution vector clocks
track modification history, operational

204
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:50,229
transplant, maintain eventual consistency.

205
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:52,704
Complete audit trails
for all offline changes.

206
00:11:52,704 --> 00:11:55,654
So these are the conflict resolution
things we have to be take care.

207
00:11:56,494 --> 00:11:58,174
So continuous security monitoring.

208
00:11:58,364 --> 00:12:02,204
For the this application, so
we have to be secure comp.

209
00:12:02,294 --> 00:12:02,849
These are the four steps.

210
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:05,219
So application monitoring.

211
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,289
And so we have to be always
monitor the application.

212
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,949
So the second one is
infrastructure monitoring.

213
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:15,539
So observe like a system behavior and
is any potential attacks we have to be.

214
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,819
And also all the authentication
attempts any in the network.

215
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:22,339
Unusual traffic generates any secural.

216
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:23,959
These are the things we have to take care.

217
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:26,549
The other one is audit log analysis.

218
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,239
We have to be.

219
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:32,154
Detailed records of all security relevant
events, automate analysis, identifies

220
00:12:32,254 --> 00:12:36,154
suspicious pattern authentication,
data access and configuration changes.

221
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:39,094
So anything happen, we
have to check this Also.

222
00:12:39,154 --> 00:12:42,154
The other one is behavior
analytics submission, learning

223
00:12:42,154 --> 00:12:45,634
models learn typical patterns for
individual patients and clinicals.

224
00:12:46,534 --> 00:12:50,094
So is any like those kind of things
models or anything he's doing?

225
00:12:50,094 --> 00:12:54,144
So we have to be, take care and
continuous monitoring all this process.

226
00:12:54,644 --> 00:12:56,084
So platform success metrics.

227
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:58,184
So these are the platform success metrics.

228
00:12:58,424 --> 00:13:00,794
So first one is like enhance
the patient engagement.

229
00:13:00,874 --> 00:13:03,284
Second one is a compliance.

230
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:05,024
Third one is the data breaches.

231
00:13:05,024 --> 00:13:07,934
Fourth one is un
uninterrupted availability.

232
00:13:08,324 --> 00:13:12,434
So the platform country
consistently achieves significantly

233
00:13:12,434 --> 00:13:13,664
higher patient engagement.

234
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:16,924
So this is one thing for the
enhance the patient engagement.

235
00:13:17,344 --> 00:13:20,374
Second one is like we have to
check like HIPAA validations,

236
00:13:20,374 --> 00:13:21,774
unwrapping ONM commitment.

237
00:13:21,824 --> 00:13:22,784
Un underwing.

238
00:13:22,784 --> 00:13:26,804
A commitment builds profound trust in
both patients and healthcare providers.

239
00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:29,654
So these things, we have to be
checked, zero data breaches.

240
00:13:29,654 --> 00:13:33,404
So we have to be, take care,
like what kind of data and also

241
00:13:33,404 --> 00:13:38,259
every time we have to be careful
with the patient information.

242
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,809
Fourth one is power, the
continuous monitoring and

243
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:42,279
automated incident response.

244
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:43,959
This is the one thing we have to care for.

245
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:47,719
We have to be, do every 20, 24
hours and seven days a week.

246
00:13:48,219 --> 00:13:49,519
So response framework.

247
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:51,439
So detection analysis is the first thing.

248
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:54,319
So we have to be like,
check any detections.

249
00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:55,719
So this thing we have to check.

250
00:13:55,989 --> 00:13:57,579
The containment is a second thing.

251
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:02,319
So any limit impact, isolate by systems,
revoking, compromise, credentials.

252
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:03,519
So those things we have to check.

253
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,589
So eradication, it's the third thing.

254
00:14:05,739 --> 00:14:09,759
Remote rates from systems by fixing
vulnerabilities, improving security

255
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:11,469
controls and updating configurations.

256
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:14,929
So recovery, the fourth thing,
validate rates are eliminated.

257
00:14:15,169 --> 00:14:18,539
The restore systems can secure
state and gradually store service

258
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:20,099
while monitoring recurrence.

259
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:22,709
So the last one is post instant analysis.

260
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:25,639
So security as a foundation.

261
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:29,139
DevSecOps in healthcare represents
more than implementing security

262
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:30,549
tools for following complaints.

263
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:34,329
At least It reflects a fundamental
philosophy that the security,

264
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:37,619
privacy and patient safety are
the foundational requirements

265
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:39,419
rather than futures to be added.

266
00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:42,899
So the My Story platform
demonstrates that robust security

267
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:46,309
flood practices and excellent user
experience aren't opposing goals.

268
00:14:47,144 --> 00:14:48,944
Success requires cultural change.

269
00:14:48,994 --> 00:14:52,054
Alongside technical
implementation, security becomes

270
00:14:52,054 --> 00:14:53,254
everyone's responsibility.

271
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:56,074
So the patient trust depends on security.

272
00:14:56,074 --> 00:15:00,494
When patients here intimate health
information, so when they rely on

273
00:15:00,494 --> 00:15:05,274
application during vulnerable moments,
when they trust systems with data

274
00:15:05,274 --> 00:15:09,304
that could literally save their
lives, robust security isn't optional.

275
00:15:09,804 --> 00:15:10,224
Thank you.

276
00:15:11,114 --> 00:15:12,584
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

277
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:13,769
Yeah.

278
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:15,779
If you have any questions,
please send an email.
