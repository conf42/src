1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,370
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,780
Thank you for joining.

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:08,709
My name is, and today I will walk you
through the ML ops in healthcare, or

4
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:14,500
simply how we can scale AI models in
hospitals and clinics by using smart

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,780
automation and monitoring frameworks.

6
00:00:17,355 --> 00:00:20,380
Before we dive in, I
have a quick question.

7
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:25,705
How many of you have seen an AI project
in healthcare that worked great in

8
00:00:25,705 --> 00:00:28,104
testing, but struggle to go live?

9
00:00:28,604 --> 00:00:31,034
I'm pretty sure a lot
of y'all have seen that.

10
00:00:31,394 --> 00:00:35,205
Yes, that's exactly the gap
we are addressing today.

11
00:00:35,925 --> 00:00:40,390
Let's move on to the next slide,
the healthcare ML ops challenge.

12
00:00:41,235 --> 00:00:45,165
Healthcare organizations
are excited about ai.

13
00:00:45,464 --> 00:00:51,434
It promises better diagnostics, faster
admin processes, and even cost savings.

14
00:00:51,794 --> 00:00:53,745
But here is the reality.

15
00:00:54,315 --> 00:01:01,215
68% of projects face IES production
failures reduce trust and

16
00:01:01,215 --> 00:01:04,095
compliance slows everything down.

17
00:01:04,515 --> 00:01:09,645
So let me ask you, what do you think
is harder building the AI model?

18
00:01:10,145 --> 00:01:12,485
Or getting it safely into production.

19
00:01:12,985 --> 00:01:14,365
Most of you would agree.

20
00:01:14,605 --> 00:01:17,244
Deployment is where things get tough.

21
00:01:18,085 --> 00:01:22,634
Let's move to slide three,
research backed lops Impact.

22
00:01:23,324 --> 00:01:25,274
Now, here is the good news.

23
00:01:25,695 --> 00:01:30,255
Research shows that structure
lops makes a huge difference.

24
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,190
Projects succeed.

25
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:39,810
73% more often, models stabilize
40% faster errors reduce, and

26
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,300
organizations save millions each year.

27
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:49,199
So if I could summarize, ML Ops isn't
just about better tech, it's about

28
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:51,740
better outcomes, faster and safer.

29
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,960
Let's move on to the next slide.

30
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,900
Healthcare specific ML lops challenges.

31
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,240
But healthcare is different
from other industries.

32
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,210
We face four unique hurdles.

33
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,250
First is regulation, meeting
FDAs and HIPAA standards.

34
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,470
Second is sensitive data.

35
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,020
Patient privacy is very critical.

36
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,510
Third is workflow fit.

37
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,530
Doctors cannot be slowed
down by clunky systems.

38
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,340
For is monitoring at
scale across hospitals.

39
00:02:25,315 --> 00:02:26,665
Not just one system.

40
00:02:27,165 --> 00:02:31,485
Now the question is, do any of
these resonate with challenges you

41
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,345
have seen in your own organization?

42
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:35,865
Something to think about.

43
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,345
Alright, let's move to the next slide.

44
00:02:38,845 --> 00:02:40,585
Comprehensive framework.

45
00:02:41,215 --> 00:02:46,375
To solve this, I use a four
phase framework model assessment,

46
00:02:46,495 --> 00:02:51,385
infrastructure readiness, pipeline
automation, monitoring systems.

47
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,355
Think of it like building a hospital.

48
00:02:54,835 --> 00:02:57,505
First, you can check the
quality of materials.

49
00:02:58,135 --> 00:02:59,725
That is the model assessment.

50
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:04,045
Then you make sure that the
building is safe and compliant.

51
00:03:04,345 --> 00:03:05,665
That is the infrastructure.

52
00:03:06,175 --> 00:03:11,125
Next, you automate daily operations
like elevators and security.

53
00:03:11,695 --> 00:03:13,015
That is the pipelines.

54
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:18,055
Finally, you keep everything
under 24 7 surveillance.

55
00:03:18,355 --> 00:03:19,525
That is the monitor.

56
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:22,655
Let's move to the next slide, phase one.

57
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:24,455
That is the model assessment.

58
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:27,875
Healthcare models can't just be accurate.

59
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:32,765
We need to check, does it work
across different patient groups?

60
00:03:33,365 --> 00:03:35,705
Is it fair and unbiased?

61
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:42,455
Can clinicians understand its decisions
and can we prove this to the regulators

62
00:03:42,905 --> 00:03:45,065
when we follow this process accurate.

63
00:03:45,565 --> 00:03:48,325
Rates go up by 64%.

64
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:51,085
So assessment is our foundation.

65
00:03:51,985 --> 00:03:58,045
Moving to the phase two infrastructure
readiness, imagine trying to

66
00:03:58,045 --> 00:04:00,175
run MRI scans on a laptop.

67
00:04:00,655 --> 00:04:02,215
It just won't work.

68
00:04:02,605 --> 00:04:07,760
Infrastructure readiness means making
sure we have the right compute and

69
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,500
security, ensuring HIPAA compliant flows.

70
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,940
Designing integrations with systems
like EHR, so doctors aren't disrupted,

71
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,340
and planning for scalability when
more hospitals adopt the model.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,590
Doing this right reduces
disruptions by 68%.

73
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:33,275
Let's move to the next slide, the phase
three, which is automated pipelines.

74
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:36,690
This is where we save
time and avoid errors.

75
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,600
Pipelines take care of data,
pre-processing and de-identification.

76
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,420
Moderate training with version control.

77
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:50,600
Safe deployments, using cannery tests
and rollbacks automatic generation

78
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,730
of documents for regulators.

79
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,040
Here is a quick analogy.

80
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,670
It's like setting up an
assembly line in a factory.

81
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,420
Once built, it runs
smoothly and consistently.

82
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,540
Let's move to the next phase.

83
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,510
That is a phase four monitoring framework.

84
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,140
Now, here is the most critical part.

85
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,400
That is monitoring.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,180
We track model accuracy in real time data
drift when patient data starts changing.

87
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,190
Alerts for clinicians.

88
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:28,120
If something looks wrong, this step
improves reliability by 47%, and most

89
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,520
importantly, keeps patients safe.

90
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,370
Let's move to the next slide.

91
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,540
Technical implementation
on ml Lops Architecture.

92
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:43,470
For those of you who like the tech site
here is the stack version Control with

93
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:50,190
Git, CICD, pipelines for approvals,
Dockers and Kubernetes for deployment,

94
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,190
Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.

95
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,750
But remember, technology,
just the enabler.

96
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:03,255
The real goal is trust and
safety in clinical use.

97
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,985
Let's move to the 11 slide.

98
00:06:05,985 --> 00:06:08,295
That is the implementation roadmap.

99
00:06:08,795 --> 00:06:14,315
Rolling this out takes about a
year, but we break it into phases.

100
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:19,235
It starts with month one and
two where we assess and plan.

101
00:06:19,865 --> 00:06:23,135
Month three and four, where
we build the foundation.

102
00:06:23,585 --> 00:06:27,455
Month five to six, we
pilot with one model.

103
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,930
From month seven to 12, we
scale to more hospitals.

104
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:39,530
Question is, if you had to pick, would
you prefer a faster pilot or a more

105
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,720
cautious rollout across the system?

106
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,660
This is something which
we need to think about.

107
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,190
So let's move to the key takeaways.

108
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,610
So to wrap up our session today,
we have some key takeaways.

109
00:06:54,345 --> 00:06:59,085
Structure lops is equal
to higher success rates.

110
00:06:59,715 --> 00:07:03,885
Healthcare has unique challenges,
but they can be sought.

111
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:10,005
The four phase framework gives
us a practical path, and the

112
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:16,215
ROI is clear, safer, faster, and
more cost effective deployments.

113
00:07:16,695 --> 00:07:22,905
The next step, starting by assessing
where your current MLO system starts.

114
00:07:23,405 --> 00:07:26,255
Thank you so much for your
time and your engagement today.

115
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:30,275
I would love to hear your
thoughts about what is the biggest

116
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:31,745
deployment challenge you're facing.
