1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,310
Speaker 14: Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,220
Welcome to com 42.

3
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,640
My name is Simran Kadri and
I'm a senior network lead.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,459
Today I'm presenting infrastructure
as code for Enterprise Network and

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,079
I will be focusing on automating
SD and zero trust architect.

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,419
This session is draw from real
world implementation across

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,339
example site like nuclear, solar,
wind, and enterprise data center.

8
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:28,790
As they are managing
thousands of network devices.

9
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:33,520
Let's start journey for
today's session and I will be

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,230
covering three main area today.

11
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:40,570
First, why additional networking is
broken and costing companies money.

12
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,785
Second, how infrastructure is code
fixes this problem with real example

13
00:00:45,895 --> 00:00:48,625
from production environment and third.

14
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:54,385
I will be giving five practical step
to follow for your infrastructure.

15
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,275
So let's begin.

16
00:00:56,775 --> 00:00:59,025
Let's begin our journey with the problem.

17
00:00:59,114 --> 00:01:02,084
We will be discussing the
problem first, then the solution.

18
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:07,174
The traditional network management is
fundamentally broken at enterprise scale.

19
00:01:07,804 --> 00:01:11,674
Imagine, for example, we
have 500 network devices.

20
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:14,884
And a security page need to
deploy across all of them.

21
00:01:15,844 --> 00:01:19,684
What traditional, across required
as such as into each device,

22
00:01:19,684 --> 00:01:23,704
copy the configuration, paste,
and repeat this 500 times.

23
00:01:24,274 --> 00:01:27,574
This going to take a week
or more than a month?

24
00:01:27,964 --> 00:01:29,014
And one typo.

25
00:01:29,044 --> 00:01:30,304
You have to start it over.

26
00:01:30,804 --> 00:01:33,204
So let me tell you what, what happened.

27
00:01:33,204 --> 00:01:33,774
Reality.

28
00:01:33,834 --> 00:01:39,264
In reality, configuration ship
silently destroy network reliability.

29
00:01:39,684 --> 00:01:43,704
And device dives from their
intended state over time and making

30
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:49,404
troubleshooting nearly impossible for
engineer and changes that should be

31
00:01:49,404 --> 00:01:54,234
taking a minute, actually takes day
due to manual coordination, change

32
00:01:54,234 --> 00:01:56,634
approval, and implementation windows.

33
00:01:57,234 --> 00:02:02,124
And when things break, there is
no quick rollback capability.

34
00:02:02,484 --> 00:02:07,794
You stop undoing these changes and
restoring from outdated backup.

35
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,274
So what industry demand.

36
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:15,614
Meanwhile, business demand
totally opposite business demand,

37
00:02:15,795 --> 00:02:19,124
deploy the network changes
globally in a minute, not day.

38
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:24,494
And maintain the zero security gap
with consistent policy enforcement and

39
00:02:24,494 --> 00:02:28,969
provides seamless connectivity across
on premises and multi-cloud environment.

40
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:33,144
And this gap between the current
capability and business requirement.

41
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,129
It's what we are going
to addressing today.

42
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:37,549
Let's focus on the solution.

43
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:41,649
The infrastructure as code fundamentally
changed the network management.

44
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:46,269
So instead of configuring device
manually, you write a code that

45
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:48,040
define your design network state.

46
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:53,114
And instead of coping change work
correctly, you test them automatically

47
00:02:53,114 --> 00:02:55,179
before the deployment in the production.

48
00:02:55,839 --> 00:03:00,074
And instead of manual fixes when problem
occur, you deploy the correction.

49
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:06,999
With one click and this approach
based on four four core principle,

50
00:03:07,089 --> 00:03:09,339
I will be explaining one by one.

51
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:12,369
The first is declarative configuration.

52
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:18,699
You define what you want network to
look like and the system determine

53
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,079
how to achieve that strength.

54
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,440
Second version, control.

55
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,725
Every change is track in gate.

56
00:03:25,385 --> 00:03:25,605
Why?

57
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:31,035
To provide a complete history and
one common rollback capability.

58
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:37,425
Third, automated validation error code
before the production deployment, not

59
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,465
after customer are getting impacted.

60
00:03:40,185 --> 00:03:42,795
You might be having thousands
of employee at your side.

61
00:03:43,295 --> 00:03:43,805
Four.

62
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:47,735
Continuous deployment from code
Commit to production deployment.

63
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:50,480
It should happen automatically
with zero memory staff.

64
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,940
So in our environment,
managing over 500 side what?

65
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,810
Previously it took three
days, five days a week.

66
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,150
Now it's completing 15 minute
with 95% rate of success rate.

67
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,440
Let's discuss this SD Sdwan architect.

68
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:13,010
Let me explain how this work with
Sdwan using Cisco Web Taylor.

69
00:04:13,015 --> 00:04:14,840
Web Taylor is a vendor I will be taking.

70
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,280
Example of, as an example
for better explanation.

71
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,680
So the architects, this architect
had three main component.

72
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,290
We manage V smart and V router.

73
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,150
We manage serve as a centralized
brain, which is handling the

74
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,940
policy, orchestration and
configuration management.

75
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,530
And what vs.

76
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:40,780
SMART does vs smart act as a control
plane making a routing decision

77
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,740
and managing the overall network.

78
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,980
And V Edge router we deploy
at every site as a data plane.

79
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,200
And V Edge router help executing the
policy and forwarding the traffic.

80
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,550
So the key advantage
here is centralization.

81
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:02,370
What it's mean when you change
a policy once in a, we manage

82
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,080
it's automatically updated.

83
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,340
Thousands of Azure router.

84
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,630
And your engineer don't
need to do a SSS session.

85
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,770
No copy pastes required, no
engineer intervention is required.

86
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,930
And when we are onboarding a new site,
the entire network configuration,

87
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:24,090
including routing security policy and
monitoring, it's deployed automatically

88
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,430
in instead of several layers,

89
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,070
declarative config.

90
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,800
Here the transformation are in
practice, what traditional approach,

91
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:39,820
500 line of CLA command, which can,
which may be error point for GI and

92
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,550
inconsistent and modern process.

93
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:48,285
One YML template, which should be
version control and reusable across

94
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:50,625
all your side and the process.

95
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:54,485
And this process has
three main step, step one.

96
00:05:55,085 --> 00:05:56,075
Define the template.

97
00:05:56,075 --> 00:06:01,355
For East side type, we, let's say we
have a nuclear site, so we should be

98
00:06:01,355 --> 00:06:05,135
having a template for nuclear side
with strict security requirement.

99
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:11,245
And for solar side and solar side, which
have a scda SCADA system, it should

100
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:17,305
be isolation isolated and wind inside
with remote monitoring specification.

101
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:20,550
Step two, store everything in a game.

102
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:26,980
In gate every Modi every modification from
your engineer, you should log, logged in

103
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,890
with the explanation and change required.

104
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,820
Pull request re, which should be
reviewed by your senior management

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,780
or higher level of engineer.

106
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,220
Step three CICD pipeline.

107
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,030
This handled the deployment automatically.

108
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,970
Syntax validation run first.

109
00:06:45,315 --> 00:06:46,485
Security compliant.

110
00:06:46,485 --> 00:06:51,555
Check execute next and if valuation
passes deployment process to the target

111
00:06:51,555 --> 00:06:59,445
devices via API Calls and let's say
if anything failed deployment, this

112
00:06:59,445 --> 00:07:02,595
deployment should stop immediately.

113
00:07:03,045 --> 00:07:03,825
The result.

114
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:06,690
Deployment that took me several days.

115
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,690
Now it's completing in few minutes.

116
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,730
So how GitHub work workflow
implementation work.

117
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,640
So here, how a real network
change flow through the system.

118
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:22,800
And there are several steps I
will be explaining one by one.

119
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,510
Step one, the pool sation.

120
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,680
This should be mandatory and
engineer need to add a new

121
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,810
wheel, for example, at any site.

122
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:38,390
So instead of logging into a router
and they create a, they should create a

123
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:44,150
branching gate, edit the YML configuration
and commit the changes with the, with

124
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,810
descriptive message and an engineer
should be having a open pull request.

125
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,740
Step two pull.

126
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:55,545
Step two is automated testing trigger.

127
00:07:56,535 --> 00:08:02,925
Okay, so why ml? Why ml? Change The
syntax and policy compliance should be

128
00:08:02,925 --> 00:08:09,015
validated by engineer to ensure that
change meet the security standard and SIM

129
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:11,175
simulation testing should be deployed.

130
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,335
We deploy there.

131
00:08:13,115 --> 00:08:17,615
In a virtual environment, we
should mirror exactly same as

132
00:08:17,615 --> 00:08:18,845
your production environment.

133
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,000
And all case result should be posted
as a comment in the poultry class.

134
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,900
Step three, peer review.

135
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,270
Senior engineers should examine the
business justification, security

136
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,340
requirement, implementation approach.

137
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,020
Read.

138
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:41,350
In reality, this validation is catches
the logical and design issue that

139
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,650
automation might be missing in step four.

140
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,085
Can redeployment this be begin this.

141
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:51,925
Begin after the approval
change, deploy to one or two.

142
00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:56,605
Test site first, and the system
monitor for 30 to 60 minute.

143
00:08:56,695 --> 00:09:03,145
And if metrics look good, deployment,
continue, it go by phases, 10%, then

144
00:09:03,145 --> 00:09:06,005
50%, then a hundred percent of that site.

145
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:08,770
And let's say if anything fails.

146
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,870
Rollout, stop and Automated
Rollback restore the previous

147
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,220
state of the configuration.

148
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,530
Step five.

149
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,980
Production deployment with
the continuous monitoring.

150
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,230
Why that?

151
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,420
Let me explain you why first, the real
time dashboard should be there to track

152
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:33,135
the progress and health checks should
run continuously because if any trigger,

153
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:35,620
we should be having immediate alert.

154
00:09:36,344 --> 00:09:41,234
In our home monitoring system and
this workflow really transformer

155
00:09:41,805 --> 00:09:46,545
transform the operation from three
to five days of change cycle with

156
00:09:46,634 --> 00:09:52,514
higher rate to same day automation
deployment with 95% of success rate.

157
00:09:53,014 --> 00:09:56,774
Let's move ahead and move to
interesting topic of this session.

158
00:09:56,924 --> 00:09:57,794
Zero trust.

159
00:09:58,754 --> 00:10:01,754
Zero trust, security represent
a fundamental shift in

160
00:10:01,754 --> 00:10:03,014
network security thinking.

161
00:10:03,514 --> 00:10:04,834
I will be explaining while.

162
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:09,444
So the old model said,
trust but verify zero.

163
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:12,234
Trust says, never trust, always verify.

164
00:10:12,924 --> 00:10:14,994
And this based on three core principle.

165
00:10:15,685 --> 00:10:20,714
Principle one is verify
explicitly what it's mean.

166
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:26,084
Authenticate and authorize every
connection request regardless of source.

167
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:31,204
In practice this mean every
user device application must

168
00:10:31,204 --> 00:10:33,184
be get getting authenticated.

169
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:37,444
Before accessing any resources in
your environment, authentication

170
00:10:37,444 --> 00:10:39,364
required a strong method.

171
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:44,545
The method like multifactor
authentication and certificate and

172
00:10:44,545 --> 00:10:50,419
authorization is continuous not one time
principle to least privilege access.

173
00:10:51,274 --> 00:10:54,994
Grant only the minimum required
network access for each workload.

174
00:10:55,354 --> 00:11:00,604
For example, ice cada system at VIN
side, which only communicate with the

175
00:11:00,604 --> 00:11:06,604
specific control server and it has no
access to cooperate email, HR database and

176
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:12,064
unrelated to the system and 0 0 0 trust.

177
00:11:12,424 --> 00:11:13,024
And four.

178
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:15,959
This through policies principle three.

179
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:17,949
Assume breaches.

180
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:23,559
Design security controller, assuming that
attacker are already inside your network.

181
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:26,169
This mean segment, your network.

182
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:30,699
So compromising one device doesn't
enable literal movement to other

183
00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:36,129
and encrypt all device, including
internal traffic and monitor

184
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,254
continuously and detect the anomaly.

185
00:11:38,794 --> 00:11:39,014
Why?

186
00:11:39,744 --> 00:11:46,674
Because in, in environment, if, let's
say example for wind side, if device got

187
00:11:46,674 --> 00:11:53,114
compromised, the attacker cannot reach
to corporate system at all or other

188
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:59,499
sites of your infrastructure because
each site should exit in own isolated

189
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:02,339
securities zone micro-segmentation.

190
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:07,549
Microsegmentation makes zero trust
operation at a scale level and

191
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:09,559
the four I will be giving four.

192
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:13,339
Real world example from
the production deployment.

193
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,369
First, consider the ADA system.

194
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:19,199
ADA system is isolated.

195
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:23,849
Example, we have a wind turbine, solar.

196
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:27,104
I inventor, which control
are completely isolated.

197
00:12:27,604 --> 00:12:32,494
From your co-op network, SCADA
devices communicate only with the

198
00:12:32,494 --> 00:12:37,234
authorized control server, have no
internal access and cannot reach

199
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:39,544
to cooperate email or file share.

200
00:12:40,144 --> 00:12:45,334
Even if a taker compromise a co
they cannot reach to his ADA system.

201
00:12:45,874 --> 00:12:48,904
Second application segmentation.

202
00:12:49,404 --> 00:12:53,319
Database tires are separated from
application and presentation layer.

203
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:53,409
Web.

204
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:56,699
Web server cannot directly
access the database.

205
00:12:57,199 --> 00:13:00,524
It's only able to access
through approved APIs.

206
00:13:01,024 --> 00:13:06,314
Third user contacts based policy
access change based on user

207
00:13:06,314 --> 00:13:11,029
identity, device compliance,
status, location, and time Also.

208
00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:16,560
Let's say, for example, an engineer
accessing a from cooperate network

209
00:13:16,859 --> 00:13:22,999
during business hour on a managed device,
which are allowed to the network, but

210
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:27,919
when same engineer from the public
wifi at nighttime on a personal laptop,

211
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:33,104
it should get denied and it should
require additional authentication.

212
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,424
Fourth traffic prioritization with.

213
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:41,769
With quality of surveys, the
mission critical is CATA traffic.

214
00:13:41,859 --> 00:13:47,619
Always get a priority even during
attacks and wi voice traffic never

215
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,139
suffer latency or a packet loss.

216
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:55,629
My so microsegmentation deliver both
security and performance together

217
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:57,524
routing protocol automation.

218
00:13:58,024 --> 00:14:02,774
Enterprise network run multiple routing
proco protocols across different domains.

219
00:14:03,334 --> 00:14:08,794
In real world network, you will see
BGP for internal age and service

220
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:15,364
provider connection, E-I-G-R-P or OSPA
for campus and branch routing and the

221
00:14:15,364 --> 00:14:18,424
OSPA for data center fabric routing.

222
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:19,884
The problem.

223
00:14:20,304 --> 00:14:23,784
The problem is each protocol
has different configuration.

224
00:14:24,504 --> 00:14:26,994
Configuration metrics and behavior.

225
00:14:27,354 --> 00:14:28,824
Behavior, right?

226
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:34,644
So managing them manually across thousands
of network devices might be error problem.

227
00:14:35,244 --> 00:14:39,924
So automation solve this through
continuous protocol optimization.

228
00:14:40,424 --> 00:14:44,294
The system adjusts the routing
metric based on real time telemetry.

229
00:14:44,924 --> 00:14:49,364
Let's say if link experience high
latency or a packet loss is, it's

230
00:14:49,424 --> 00:14:51,374
automatically increase the cost.

231
00:14:51,374 --> 00:14:51,829
So the traffic.

232
00:14:52,604 --> 00:14:54,134
Prefer the alternate part.

233
00:14:54,634 --> 00:14:59,044
Redistribution policy are optimized
automatically to prevent the

234
00:14:59,044 --> 00:15:01,474
routing loop and suboptimal part.

235
00:15:01,974 --> 00:15:05,814
The past selection are based on
application requirement, voice

236
00:15:05,814 --> 00:15:10,524
traffic, route over low latency
fiber link both data transfer

237
00:15:10,524 --> 00:15:13,674
use low, lower cost link only.

238
00:15:14,174 --> 00:15:15,524
Let's take a real example.

239
00:15:16,024 --> 00:15:21,714
Example wind side at a wind side,
ru at wind side, running A BGP

240
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:24,324
with ISP and OSP internally.

241
00:15:24,894 --> 00:15:28,164
So automation continuously
monitored this link quality.

242
00:15:28,584 --> 00:15:35,274
When ISP link degraded BGP automatically
fell over to secondary ISP without any

243
00:15:35,694 --> 00:15:37,469
manual intervention of the engineer.

244
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:43,959
And if internal OSPF link fail,
the protocol reverts in a second

245
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,129
and we should be having immediate
alert in a monitoring system.

246
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:52,979
Let's move ahead and see the
network data center networking.

247
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:59,729
A CI fabric, the Cisco A CI represent
a shift in a data center networking,

248
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:02,129
and this based on three key pillar.

249
00:16:02,849 --> 00:16:05,909
The first is application
centric policy model.

250
00:16:06,644 --> 00:16:10,244
Traditional networking
is device centric, right?

251
00:16:10,744 --> 00:16:13,054
But you configured v learn on switches.

252
00:16:13,174 --> 00:16:17,849
You require access list on
fireboard and routing on router.

253
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:21,179
But a CA is application centric.

254
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:26,069
You define the policy based on application
requirement and a CA, translate them

255
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:31,199
into device configuration, which
should be automatically, and you never

256
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,664
configure any individual search code.

257
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:35,849
It should be automated.

258
00:16:36,349 --> 00:16:37,819
Second spine lift.

259
00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:38,749
Fabric architect.

260
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:43,159
Every leaf switch connect to
every spine, switch in full mass.

261
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:49,879
If any leaf can communicate with any
other leaf, it should be to hop maximum.

262
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:54,604
This provides consistency, low
latency, and high bandwidth.

263
00:16:55,104 --> 00:16:56,929
The VXLAN overlay.

264
00:16:57,334 --> 00:17:02,974
Which enable a mess in massive scale
environment with many millions of

265
00:17:02,974 --> 00:17:05,014
endpoint and thousands of VLANs.

266
00:17:05,514 --> 00:17:07,944
Third, API driven management.

267
00:17:08,514 --> 00:17:10,789
Everything in a CI is API driven.

268
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:14,129
The third pillar, API driven management.

269
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:17,339
So everything in a CI is API driven.

270
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:21,014
You can integrate Terraform,
ible, and Python grid.

271
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:26,549
CICD pipeline automatically provision
the network resources as a part of

272
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:31,919
application deployment and you can query
the fabric for real time health metrics,

273
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:34,289
traffic flow, and policy compliance.

274
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:40,164
A CI integrate with S Dwan controller,
and when you deploy an application in a

275
00:17:40,164 --> 00:17:42,484
data center, a CI provision the network.

276
00:17:42,984 --> 00:17:48,954
And as driven policy update automatically
to allow the branch offices to access

277
00:17:48,954 --> 00:17:54,864
the application and security policy
are enforced con consistently from

278
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:57,174
branch router to the data center core.

279
00:17:57,674 --> 00:18:03,519
Let's see how cloud integration work
here in modern enterprise enterprises.

280
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:09,399
Which using AWS Azure Cloud Network and
some of them may be having a private

281
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:15,099
data center and your network automation
must suppose this reality, I will

282
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:20,889
be explaining three key integration
point first, AWS integration.

283
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:26,799
The AWS Transit Gateway Connect
multiple VPCs and on premises

284
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,479
network through a central hub.

285
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:32,709
So instead of managing point to
point VP internal between every VPCs.

286
00:18:33,294 --> 00:18:37,134
And every site, everything
connect to transit gateway.

287
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:42,614
And when deploy a new site with the
Sdwan router, it automatically establish

288
00:18:42,614 --> 00:18:49,964
the VPN channel on AWS transit gateway
and the site instantly have access to

289
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:55,214
cloud hosted monitoring application
without any manual configuration of VPNs.

290
00:18:56,174 --> 00:18:58,484
Second Azure Cloud connectivity.

291
00:18:58,984 --> 00:19:04,944
Azure virtual van provide hub to spoke
architect means connecting multiple

292
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:10,764
region on an on-prem premises site,
and Azure automatically manage the

293
00:19:10,764 --> 00:19:16,614
routing between the spoke via hub
and automation script created and in

294
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:21,894
a virtual van connection, and when
deploying a new site, so policy based

295
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,444
routing directed traffic appropriately.

296
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:25,034
Third.

297
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:28,559
The policy consistent
across all the environment.

298
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:31,619
So this is the most critical benefit.

299
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:37,269
The traditional setup configure on
premises net firewalls, AWS security

300
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:39,189
group, zoom network security group.

301
00:19:39,189 --> 00:19:45,059
Separately, this lead to policy are drift
and security gap and compliance failure.

302
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:49,219
Maybe the solution is define the
policy once in centralized engine.

303
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:55,939
Or automation, translate them into a
platform Specific configuration, for

304
00:19:55,939 --> 00:19:58,309
example, is SCADA system communication.

305
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:02,819
This SCADA communicate only with
the control server on port 5 0

306
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:09,094
2, and it's enforce identically
on premises in AWS and in Azure,

307
00:20:09,594 --> 00:20:11,604
monitoring play a crucial role.

308
00:20:12,594 --> 00:20:15,239
So automation without the monitoring.

309
00:20:15,939 --> 00:20:18,909
It's like we are walking blindfolded.

310
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:23,859
You need a real time visibility
to detect the issue proactively.

311
00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:26,859
And this based on four key metrics.

312
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,959
I will be explaining one by one,
the first interface utilization

313
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:34,389
and the error rate we collect.

314
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:39,754
For example I am taking example
of our side, so we collect the

315
00:20:39,754 --> 00:20:42,604
interface statistic every 60 seconds.

316
00:20:42,979 --> 00:20:49,599
And if utilization exit 80%, the electric,
it should be if error rate spike,

317
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:54,509
incident ticket, open auto automatically
in our engineer support group.

318
00:20:55,229 --> 00:20:58,919
Second application performance
metric, which include

319
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:00,859
latency, packet loss, and gt.

320
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:05,719
We continuously measure the latency
between the site and the I-P-S-L-A

321
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:07,549
probe and the net flow data.

322
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:12,939
And if latency exceed the threshold, we
investigate routing path and the link

323
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:16,379
quality Third security event correlation.

324
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:22,469
Our SIEM ingest log from firewall,
SD event controller and switch

325
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:26,789
machine learning model, detect
the anomaly, like a sudden traffic

326
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:29,369
spike or a normal IP address.

327
00:21:29,744 --> 00:21:32,864
Which should trigger the
alert in monitoring system.

328
00:21:33,364 --> 00:21:35,974
Fourth, policy compliance validation.

329
00:21:36,574 --> 00:21:39,364
We continuously validating the de.

330
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:44,284
The device that run on approved
configuration and security policy are

331
00:21:44,284 --> 00:21:46,954
consist consistently applying alert.

332
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:53,104
If configuration drift occur, the alert
trigger and automated remediation can be

333
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:55,174
reapplied to the correct configuration.

334
00:21:55,674 --> 00:22:00,834
All telemetry fit into our into monitoring
platform, providing end-to-end visibility

335
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:05,634
from application layer to the physical
infrastructure when issuer detected.

336
00:22:05,904 --> 00:22:10,914
Automated alert are trigger in engineer
queue and incident ticket are a

337
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:15,624
automatically with the help of run
book guide, troubleshooting it, get

338
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:18,624
addresses, and if the issue is known.

339
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:23,769
Automated remediation exit execute
without the engineer intervention.

340
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:29,339
Let me give the five takeaway
from the today's session, and by

341
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:34,549
following this, you also can implement
implement the SD in your environment.

342
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:40,589
So five action enable, five actionable
item steps you should follow to implement.

343
00:22:41,324 --> 00:22:42,794
Implement in your environment.

344
00:22:43,064 --> 00:22:43,874
Take away one.

345
00:22:44,444 --> 00:22:45,854
Start the version control.

346
00:22:46,244 --> 00:22:50,144
So before automating anything,
migrate the existing network

347
00:22:50,144 --> 00:22:52,184
configuration into a gate repository.

348
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:56,894
Pick one device type and export
the configuration and commit them

349
00:22:56,894 --> 00:22:59,354
into gate with meaningful folder.

350
00:22:59,354 --> 00:23:04,424
Restructure and establish a
process where any configuration

351
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,524
change must be committed to gate.

352
00:23:06,704 --> 00:23:08,054
And this cause nothing.

353
00:23:08,114 --> 00:23:11,614
To implement, what benefits are I take?

354
00:23:11,794 --> 00:23:17,404
Take away tool, build a validation
framework before deploying any changes.

355
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:22,474
Validate, validate them, automatically
implement pre-deployment testing,

356
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:26,914
including syntax checking policy,
compliance, checking and simulation

357
00:23:27,004 --> 00:23:28,504
testing in virtual environment.

358
00:23:28,864 --> 00:23:33,724
And this validation really catches
80% of the error before going into

359
00:23:33,904 --> 00:23:35,404
production or before going to live.

360
00:23:35,904 --> 00:23:36,774
Take over three.

361
00:23:37,464 --> 00:23:40,464
Adopt gradual rollout
with canary deployment.

362
00:23:41,304 --> 00:23:44,484
Never deploy changes to
all device simultaneously.

363
00:23:44,904 --> 00:23:50,154
Deploy one or two test device first,
and then monitor first 30 to 60 minute,

364
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:56,604
and then roll out to 10%, 50%, and
then a hundred percent at each stage.

365
00:23:56,934 --> 00:24:01,849
Automated health check, which should
be there, which validate the success.

366
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:04,104
Gross gradual rollout.

367
00:24:04,104 --> 00:24:06,444
Limit that blast the radius of failure.

368
00:24:06,944 --> 00:24:07,784
Take away four.

369
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:10,184
Integrate the monitoring earlier.

370
00:24:10,934 --> 00:24:14,084
Deploy com Comprehensive
monitoring before the automation

371
00:24:14,084 --> 00:24:15,704
to establish the baseline matter.

372
00:24:16,244 --> 00:24:19,814
You need to know your network
normal behavior before the

373
00:24:19,814 --> 00:24:21,164
automation changes to it.

374
00:24:21,554 --> 00:24:26,294
And automation is only safe
when you can detect the issue

375
00:24:26,894 --> 00:24:29,144
immediately or in instantly.

376
00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:32,809
Take away five automated
rollback procedure.

377
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:38,359
Ensure automated rollback capability for
rapid recovery from the failed development

378
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:44,599
and maintain the previous configuration in
Git so you can always revert to the last

379
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,789
known good state of that configuration.

380
00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:51,144
And test the rollback procedure
regularly before, before going into

381
00:24:51,144 --> 00:24:55,444
the production production so that we
won't be having any false incident.

382
00:24:55,944 --> 00:25:00,264
I must say start small, pick
one, use case, prove value,

383
00:25:00,384 --> 00:25:06,024
and then only scale this work
across more than 500 side for us.

384
00:25:06,594 --> 00:25:08,184
You also do it too.

385
00:25:08,684 --> 00:25:11,624
So thank you so much for your time today.

386
00:25:12,104 --> 00:25:17,174
To recap, traditional networking is
broken infrastructure as code fixes it.

387
00:25:17,594 --> 00:25:21,929
You can start today with your version
control, the Journey to Automate.

388
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:23,789
Policy driven zero.

389
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,609
Trust network infrastructure
is achievable.

390
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:29,699
So start small and then go for scale.

391
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:34,709
I hope this session provided practical
insight and actionable strategy

392
00:25:34,889 --> 00:25:38,699
for implementing infrastructure as
code in your network environment.

393
00:25:39,089 --> 00:25:39,989
Thank you so much.
