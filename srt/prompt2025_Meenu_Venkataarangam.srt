1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,369
Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:01,519 --> 00:00:02,540
I'm Nina Villa.

3
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,390
I'm a program manager
at three Code Solution.

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,710
Today I will walk you through on
how Enterprise can drive successful

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,210
large scale migration using the
process automation and AI innovation.

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,740
So over the next few minutes, we
will explore how automation transform

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,090
migration from one-time project
into a continuous capabilities

8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,610
that fuel digital transformations.

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:25,640
I.

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,650
So first we will see the
evolution of enterprise migration.

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,750
In the past, migrations were simple lift
and shift activities, just moving the

12
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,640
workloads from one place to another.

13
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:41,200
Today, they have become far more
complex involving multiple teams,

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,890
tools, and compliance framework.

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,650
But the future is different.

16
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,029
It is about treating the migration
as a strategical capacity, so

17
00:00:48,029 --> 00:00:52,650
continuous automated transitions where
system evolved dynamically without

18
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,600
disrupting the business operations.

19
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,160
So in today's world, automation
is no longer an optional.

20
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:01,460
It is a strategical necessity
for any organization.

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,070
So with respect to migration, manual
migration comes with a real pain points,

22
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,780
long project timeline, unpredictable
result, and a high risk of errors.

23
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,820
So automation directly addresses these
issues by shortening the delivery

24
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,740
timelines, improving the predictability.

25
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:24,725
Enhancing the data quality and freezing
the specialized team for innovation

26
00:01:24,725 --> 00:01:26,645
instead of repetitive migration work.

27
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:31,355
So automation is not just about
speed, it's about reliability,

28
00:01:31,385 --> 00:01:33,395
consistency, and governance.

29
00:01:33,895 --> 00:01:39,325
Now we will see how migration can be
done in a scalable and a repeatable way.

30
00:01:39,805 --> 00:01:44,125
So each organization should anchor
them around the below four pillars.

31
00:01:44,425 --> 00:01:46,495
Number one, discovery automation.

32
00:01:46,795 --> 00:01:50,995
Number two is a transformation engine
three is the orchestration platform, and

33
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:52,885
number four is the automated testing.

34
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:56,785
So each pillars complement
the other together.

35
00:01:56,845 --> 00:02:02,455
They ensure every step from analysis to
execution is efficient and auditable.

36
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:05,804
So now we will move on with the
first step, which is nothing but

37
00:02:05,804 --> 00:02:08,024
the discovery automation here.

38
00:02:08,355 --> 00:02:11,925
The process will automatically
discover all the dependencies.

39
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:15,615
Data lineages and also the
system interconnection.

40
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:21,615
So in traditional method, documenting
this relationship to take weeks or months.

41
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:28,154
Now with this automated discovery, we can
visualize the entire ecosystem, understand

42
00:02:28,154 --> 00:02:32,985
how every data source and the services
impact each other, and allowing the team

43
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:35,235
to plan the migration intelligently.

44
00:02:35,735 --> 00:02:39,425
So once we know what to migrate,
automation help us to handle

45
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:40,805
the transformation at scale.

46
00:02:41,405 --> 00:02:45,515
This includes automated schema,
conversion code, refactoring,

47
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:47,255
and bulk data migration.

48
00:02:47,795 --> 00:02:51,935
For instance, tools can now convert
the Oracle schema to Postgres,

49
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:56,105
SQL rewrites store procedures,
and migrate the terabytes of

50
00:02:56,105 --> 00:02:58,325
data with built-in validation.

51
00:02:58,955 --> 00:03:03,185
The goal is accuracy, speed,
and minimal manual touch points.

52
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:06,835
So here we see the three most
common migration pattern.

53
00:03:06,955 --> 00:03:12,835
Number one is the cloud migration, like
moving the workloads to AWS Azure or GCP.

54
00:03:13,285 --> 00:03:17,185
The second one is the big data
modernization, like transitioning

55
00:03:17,185 --> 00:03:19,765
from Hadoop to modern cloud platform.

56
00:03:20,185 --> 00:03:24,775
And third one is the data
warehouse evolution modernizing

57
00:03:24,775 --> 00:03:26,665
to a platform like Snowflake.

58
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:30,085
With automated schemas
and query translation.

59
00:03:30,415 --> 00:03:35,395
So each pattern benefits largely from
automation, reducing the cost and

60
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:38,005
time while improving the confidence.

61
00:03:38,505 --> 00:03:41,595
So now we move on with the
intelligent orchestration.

62
00:03:42,105 --> 00:03:46,545
So even with automation,
orchestration is critical, like how

63
00:03:46,545 --> 00:03:48,855
we sequence and monitor every step.

64
00:03:49,575 --> 00:03:52,125
So intelligent orchestration
defines workflows.

65
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,240
Executes them automatically adapts
to condition in real time and

66
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,640
validate each stage continuously.

67
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:06,300
It's like having an air traffic controller
ensuring every migration activity runs

68
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,030
smoothly without collision or downtime.

69
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,680
So now we have come to the
last pillar, which is nothing

70
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,000
but the automation testing.

71
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,890
So automation testing ensures
quality and reliability across

72
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,660
every stages of migration.

73
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:25,910
It systematically validates each component
against the functional and the performance

74
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,800
benchmark, achieving a coverage that
manual testing can't even match.

75
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,470
So differential testing automatically
the source and the target systems

76
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:41,810
to catch the hidden logic or any
data issues early with real-time

77
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,000
monitoring and automated rollback.

78
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:49,625
Teams gain instant visibility and
can recover rapidly if problem arise.

79
00:04:50,195 --> 00:04:56,585
So making migration faster, safer,
and far more predictable is the main

80
00:04:56,585 --> 00:04:57,995
goal for this automation testing.

81
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:04,585
So now we are moving towards how AI had
exponential values to these migrations.

82
00:05:05,065 --> 00:05:08,875
So mission learnings can
analyze previous migrations to

83
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,275
predict effort, cost, and risk.

84
00:05:11,905 --> 00:05:17,065
And then the AI driven automation
process are just workflows dynamically

85
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:19,495
to resolve issues in real time.

86
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,525
And then the last one is
the predictive analytics.

87
00:05:23,109 --> 00:05:26,349
Forecasting the potential
bottlenecks before they happens.

88
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,359
So these things allow the team to
act proactively rather than reactive.

89
00:05:31,859 --> 00:05:36,090
So zero time migration strategies plays
a key role in all the organizations.

90
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:39,270
Business continuity is non-negotiable.

91
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:43,650
So modern strategies like continuous
replication, intelligent routing, and

92
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:48,539
instant rollback allows us to migrate
system without user even noticing.

93
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,270
This means that no weekend cut over, no
loss, productivity, and all migration

94
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,369
happens while the business keep running.

95
00:05:56,869 --> 00:06:01,009
So the ultimate goal is to move beyond
project-based thinking and to make

96
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:03,229
migration and enterprise capability.

97
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:08,149
That means investing in automation
platform, nourishing skilled teams,

98
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:12,739
building repeatable frameworks, and
making a solid technology foundation

99
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:18,679
enterprise that do this can adapt quickly
to new technology and gain a competitive

100
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:21,379
edge through an agility and speed.

101
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:23,949
So here is a simple roadmap to start.

102
00:06:24,609 --> 00:06:26,889
Assess your current migration process.

103
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:32,889
Define your target automation vision,
then implement gradually beginning

104
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:35,019
with the high impact use cases.

105
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:38,619
Then measure and optimize continuously.

106
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:40,899
It's about building momentum.

107
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:46,689
Start small, learn, and then
expand every success compounds

108
00:06:46,749 --> 00:06:49,029
into a long-term transformation.

109
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:50,939
Thank you all for joining.

110
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:55,139
I hope the session gave you a new
perspective on how automation and AI

111
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,419
are redefining the enterprise migration.

112
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:02,219
So let's go and explore how we can
create more migration excellence

113
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:04,079
within our organizations.

114
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:04,559
Thank you.
