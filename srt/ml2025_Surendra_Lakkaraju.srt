1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:02,820
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,340
I'm Serena Raju, a senior software
development engineer at Amazon.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,710
Today I will be talking about one of
the most critical and rapidly evolving

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:20,310
challenges in e-commerce fraud, and
more importantly, how machine learning

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:26,460
is transforming, how we combat it as
the digital economic grows soon as

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,535
the sophistication of suicide crime.

7
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:36,135
We'll explore how traditional
systems are feeling and why machine

8
00:00:36,135 --> 00:00:39,585
learning is emerging as a more
resilient and scalable solution.

9
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:45,705
So the topic is harnessing machine
learning to combat e-commerce fraud.

10
00:00:47,265 --> 00:00:54,974
By 2026, the global e-commerce is
projected to hit nearly $9 trillion.

11
00:00:55,845 --> 00:00:56,925
The tremendous growth.

12
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,515
It comes with a risk.

13
00:01:03,075 --> 00:01:08,715
Fraud is growing at more than
20% per year for businesses.

14
00:01:09,045 --> 00:01:13,545
This means not only direct revenue
loss, but damage to customer

15
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:16,905
trust and brand reputation.

16
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:19,485
I want you to think about this.

17
00:01:19,575 --> 00:01:25,245
What happens when a genuine customer's
card gets strongly flagged and declined?

18
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:29,774
They don't just lose patience,
they might never return.

19
00:01:31,964 --> 00:01:36,014
How many of you have experienced a
false decline while shopping online?

20
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,205
Probably many

21
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:41,455
traditional rule system worked well.

22
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,335
In a simpler time, you would set through
like block all the transaction over

23
00:01:47,335 --> 00:01:50,244
a thousand dollars from a new device.

24
00:01:50,395 --> 00:01:50,934
But today.

25
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,580
The frauds are faster
and more coordinator.

26
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:02,440
These rules can't adapt the consequences
over 28%, false positive meaning

27
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,390
real customers are turned away.

28
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:10,690
And these false declines cost
over $3.6 billion every year

29
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,970
just from lost transaction.

30
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,890
So if Ruby Systems are updated,
what's the alternative?

31
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:20,829
Machine learning.

32
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:27,100
Machine learning has changed the game
and through static rules we now use

33
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:29,890
systems that can learn and evolve.

34
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,170
Let's take a closer look.

35
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:38,350
ML models can process nearly millions
transaction per second and analyze

36
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,490
thousands of features far beyond
what an analyst can do manually

37
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,300
with over 96% detection accuracy.

38
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,329
And an 81% drop in false positive.

39
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,700
The result speaks for themself.

40
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,529
Customers enjoy smoother
transaction and business stops

41
00:02:56,529 --> 00:02:58,180
more fraud with less friction.

42
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:07,870
In supervised learning, we train
models on historical data where,

43
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:13,329
which, where we already know
which transaction were fraudulent.

44
00:03:15,505 --> 00:03:19,945
The random forest algorithm are
great inter interpretability

45
00:03:20,695 --> 00:03:26,035
and work well when we need to
explain decisions to regulate us.

46
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:31,615
Whereas the gradient boosting shines
with imbalance data like fraud

47
00:03:31,615 --> 00:03:34,465
case, which are rare but critical.

48
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:42,415
The neural network can spot settle complex
pattern even humans can't articulate.

49
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:49,495
And all of them work in real
time under 7,200 milliseconds per

50
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:55,165
transaction, even when handling over
a hundred thousand conference session.

51
00:03:56,755 --> 00:03:59,520
Think of this teaching a spam filter, but

52
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:06,495
only the stakes are high and
it's more real in terms of the

53
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:09,060
customers and the dollar amount.

54
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,769
So model selection depends on the specific
fraud patterns and the data volume

55
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,370
and the explainability requirements.

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,760
Depending on that, we can either use
one of them or the combination of these,

57
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,360
but what about new frauds
that we haven't seen before?

58
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:36,870
That's where the unsupervised
learning comes in.

59
00:04:38,235 --> 00:04:42,375
These model don't need labeled examples.

60
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:44,835
They just look at the anomalies.

61
00:04:45,615 --> 00:04:50,684
Some of them are like isolation
Forest works by separating

62
00:04:50,684 --> 00:04:53,505
out individual behaviors.

63
00:04:54,765 --> 00:04:56,715
Another one is Altman coder.

64
00:04:57,015 --> 00:05:02,025
Try to reconstruct normal behaviors
and flag anything that doesn't fit.

65
00:05:03,015 --> 00:05:04,485
Clustering fine groups.

66
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:06,555
Sorry.

67
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:11,595
Clustering algorithms, buying groups
of suspicious pattern like fraud rings,

68
00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:18,825
these tool detects over 26% of the
novel fraud items, threats that would

69
00:05:18,825 --> 00:05:21,825
have bypassed traditional filters.

70
00:05:23,715 --> 00:05:29,895
So these unsupervised learnings are
critical component as these will identify

71
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:31,815
some of the unknown fraud patterns.

72
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:35,115
And allow us to detect before it happens.

73
00:05:37,815 --> 00:05:39,555
Features are the signals.

74
00:05:39,615 --> 00:05:46,065
Our model learned from raw data, like
transaction time or IP address is useful.

75
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:53,055
But when we combine them creatively,
we unlock powerful indicators.

76
00:05:54,915 --> 00:06:00,885
Temporal features help us to detect
timing anomalies like buying.

77
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,659
500 gift cards in five seconds.

78
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,669
Network features really reveal links
between users, devices, and ips.

79
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:19,460
Behavior features like cursor movement
or timing speed can distinguish bots

80
00:06:19,609 --> 00:06:22,284
from human with over 90% accuracy.

81
00:06:24,104 --> 00:06:29,269
Great models needs great features,
and these must evolve constantly.

82
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:36,439
As the frauds adapt to these feature
engineering transforms raw transactions

83
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:40,489
into the rich and informative
signals that could dramatically

84
00:06:40,489 --> 00:06:42,949
improve the model performance.

85
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:48,019
The most effective feature
often combine data across these

86
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:54,769
multiple domains, creating a
multidimensional risk indicator, and

87
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:57,079
that FoST cannot easily manipulate.

88
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,260
Ion.

89
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,499
Yeah.

90
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:05,299
Evaluation is essential as static
feature sets quickly become targets

91
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,909
for sophisticated fraud techniques.

92
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:10,499
Detecting fraud is one thing.

93
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:13,679
Doing it at scale is another.

94
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,539
Imagine Black Friday, millions
of transaction in minutes.

95
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:22,924
We need system that make fraud decisions.

96
00:07:24,104 --> 00:07:31,244
In under one 50 milliseconds and support
million transaction per minute, and

97
00:07:31,664 --> 00:07:34,874
for sure it needs to be up and running.

98
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,164
It should never go down.

99
00:07:37,754 --> 00:07:43,214
That's why we use distributed fault
tolerant microservice based architectures

100
00:07:43,994 --> 00:07:46,064
with the terabyte scale storage.

101
00:07:47,474 --> 00:07:51,074
This infrastructure enables
us to stop fraud in real time.

102
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:53,384
Without slowing the customers.

103
00:07:54,584 --> 00:07:56,414
So we need high performance processing.

104
00:07:57,314 --> 00:07:59,144
We're using distributed architecture.

105
00:08:00,224 --> 00:08:04,874
We'll use the optimized storage and
we'll have a resilient infrastructure,

106
00:08:05,174 --> 00:08:10,934
the cloud-based infrastructure that
will enable us to make sure if there are

107
00:08:10,934 --> 00:08:15,944
any failures, we have the other set of
infrastructure up and running for us.

108
00:08:16,944 --> 00:08:21,984
Some businesses aren't ready to
go all in on ML, and that's okay.

109
00:08:22,674 --> 00:08:24,894
Hybrid systems are a great bridge.

110
00:08:26,394 --> 00:08:30,354
They combine event driven
rules with ML intelligence.

111
00:08:30,954 --> 00:08:35,904
Think like a pilot using autopilot,
but still able to intervene.

112
00:08:37,374 --> 00:08:42,984
Rules provide guardrails, and
ML finds their nuanced patterns.

113
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:48,939
These hybrid system can push
detection accuracy above 97%.

114
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:56,019
And because they are explainable,
they satisfy the regulatory needs.

115
00:08:57,309 --> 00:08:59,619
So we'll have this adaptive learning.

116
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:04,639
We'll have these business rules or the
guardrail that's encode the business

117
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:07,909
expertise will have the integration layer.

118
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:10,239
That is where decision on these fusion.

119
00:09:11,214 --> 00:09:13,914
And we'll have this feedback
mechanism where we can

120
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:16,314
continuously optimize the system.

121
00:09:17,314 --> 00:09:24,094
Now coming to the manual reviews,
now not all cases can be automated.

122
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:29,284
That's where we need
some smart manual review.

123
00:09:29,284 --> 00:09:34,414
Comes in picture ml, prioritize
which cases to review and

124
00:09:34,414 --> 00:09:36,064
routes him to the right analyst.

125
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:43,279
It highlights suspicious signals and
learns from analyst decisions, feeding

126
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,499
those insight back into the model.

127
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:52,999
This human in the loop system cuts
review time by over 30% and improves

128
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:56,599
the decision accuracy by more than 40%.

129
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,999
It's a win-win for both
security team and the customers.

130
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:03,559
The smart.

131
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:07,839
Manual review systems have improved
the review efficiency as well,

132
00:10:09,189 --> 00:10:13,599
thus reducing the decision time
by a lot from minutes to seconds.

133
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:21,039
The human machine collaboration creates a
powerful feedback loop that continuously

134
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:28,959
improves both automate systems and
the human system for the more complex

135
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,659
cases where the pure automation.

136
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:33,729
It cannot be handled reliably.

137
00:10:34,729 --> 00:10:39,859
Let's talk some of the business values
that we see with the ML four prevention.

138
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:45,209
The companies that uses the
ML fraud preventions reports

139
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:50,579
a 23% drop and fraud ops cost.

140
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:57,959
Nearly 18% increase in approvals of good.

141
00:10:58,349 --> 00:11:06,269
Transactions, over 30% fewer customer
complaints due to false declines.

142
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:12,389
So it's not just stopping fraud,
it's about driving revenue,

143
00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:15,269
customer satisfaction, and loyalty.

144
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:17,079
What's next?

145
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:23,919
Explainable AI will make black
box model easier to audit.

146
00:11:26,064 --> 00:11:31,854
The next generation of fraud models
will provide clear explanation

147
00:11:32,064 --> 00:11:36,804
of decision that could meet their
regulatory requirements while

148
00:11:36,804 --> 00:11:39,204
maintaining the detection performance.

149
00:11:40,914 --> 00:11:46,464
Federated learning will help companies
collaborate on fighting fraud

150
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:49,434
without sharing the sensitive data.

151
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:53,214
These collaborated more
across the organization.

152
00:11:54,684 --> 00:12:00,624
Sharing NONSENSITIVE data will enable
industry-wide PRI fraud protection.

153
00:12:01,794 --> 00:12:03,799
While we do preserve the private privacy

154
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:15,114
and realtime adaption will let morally
wall instantly when fraud patterns change.

155
00:12:16,554 --> 00:12:18,204
So the continuous learning system.

156
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:21,864
That updates within seconds
of new fraud pattern images

157
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,684
will close the adaption gap.

158
00:12:24,714 --> 00:12:32,004
With the fraud leading platforms now
demonstrate model and updating under 30

159
00:12:32,004 --> 00:12:34,434
seconds after detecting the normal attack.

160
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:41,274
The future of fraud detection is
master faster and more collaborative.

161
00:12:42,894 --> 00:12:46,374
So we need to have these fraud prevention.

162
00:12:47,544 --> 00:12:51,504
With more collaboration, adapt
their and explainable system.

163
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:59,094
Organization that invest in advanced
ML capabilities now have been better

164
00:12:59,094 --> 00:13:04,104
positioned to come back to more
sophisticated frauds while maintaining

165
00:13:04,104 --> 00:13:07,134
the frictionless customer experiences.

166
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:11,184
Thank you for listening to the topic.

167
00:13:11,544 --> 00:13:12,839
I hope you enjoyed it.
