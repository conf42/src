1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
My name is Oma and I'm
joined by my colleague Nain.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,450
We're thrilled to be here at the Con 42
lms discussing one of the most exciting

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,340
and transformative topics in our field.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,330
Generative ai.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,540
Data science has always embraced
innovation, but the emergence

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,880
of generative AI presents a
truly transformative shift.

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,790
Before we dive in, we're gonna
quickly introduce ourselves.

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,660
I'm a platform engineer IBM within the
client engineering team, working mainly

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,080
on automation pilots helping clients
achieve their transformation goals.

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:25,620
Nin.

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,720
Hi everyone.

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,140
I'm Nin.

13
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,740
I am data scientist in
IBM Cloud Engineering.

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,670
Same team as O Omar and my daily
does involve trying to understand

15
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,720
client's problem, trying to solve
them with data and ai, and now while

16
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,340
trying to solve them with Ative ai.

17
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:41,180
Thank you.

18
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:41,540
Darin.

19
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,470
Before we dive in, I'm gonna
quickly just walk you through

20
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,490
what we've been covering today.

21
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,285
I'll be.

22
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,300
First talk, walking through the
evolving landscape of data science.

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,030
I'll then pass on to Darin, who
will share her practical experience

24
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,830
with genes and then her the impact
of Genes VI on data scientists.

25
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,470
And I'll then look at the future of data
science with genes and finally share

26
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,450
some actionable next steps at the end.

27
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:05,770
yeah, let's dive in.

28
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,390
Generative AI didn't appear overnight, as
you can see from the chat on the right.

29
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,190
Is market size, has shuttle over
the past few years and will continue

30
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,690
to do so over the next decade.

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,310
However, several key technological
breakthroughs have enabled its rapid rise

32
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,470
in recent years from the introduction
of transformer architecture to the

33
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,330
access of massive data sets, and now
even advances comput computational power

34
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,920
like NVIDIA's, GPUs and TPU have made
large scale AI trading more feasible.

35
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,155
But how exactly is generative AI
different from traditional AI that

36
00:01:40,155 --> 00:01:41,445
we've seen over the past few years?

37
00:01:41,975 --> 00:01:46,595
traditional AI focuses on analyzing
existing data sets while generative

38
00:01:46,595 --> 00:01:50,855
AI is focusing on creating new
content like your images, your

39
00:01:50,855 --> 00:01:53,555
text, even our music and code.

40
00:01:54,055 --> 00:01:57,055
And you are all accustomed this,
accustomed to this with models like

41
00:01:57,055 --> 00:02:01,645
G PT 4.5, that can now even create
synthetic data sets that preserve

42
00:02:01,645 --> 00:02:06,505
static statistical properties
while also protecting pro privacy.

43
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:10,185
And this is something that an army will
touch upon with our experiences later on.

44
00:02:10,685 --> 00:02:15,755
However, to fully grasp the scale of
this transformation, let's explore

45
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:20,375
how AI workflows have shifted from
this prediction to generation.

46
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:20,435
I.

47
00:02:20,935 --> 00:02:26,275
For years, AI and data science primarily
focused on prediction based models.

48
00:02:26,524 --> 00:02:32,434
classifying data, making forecasts
and optimizing processes on based

49
00:02:32,434 --> 00:02:33,934
on historical patterns, right?

50
00:02:34,384 --> 00:02:37,594
However, with generative ai, we're
moving beyond just prediction

51
00:02:37,594 --> 00:02:39,634
creation, like I mentioned before.

52
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:42,314
synthetic data, image,
text, all that good stuff.

53
00:02:42,974 --> 00:02:46,934
This shift, introducing a new way
of thinking about AI workflows.

54
00:02:47,594 --> 00:02:48,314
Let's break it down.

55
00:02:48,854 --> 00:02:52,784
on the left side, we can see the data
science lifecycle before this shift.

56
00:02:53,594 --> 00:02:57,474
And this, showcases the traditional
data science lifecycle, which

57
00:02:57,474 --> 00:03:01,264
involves, your business understanding,
defining the problem to be solved.

58
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,544
Data mining and cleaning,
gathering and pre-processing this

59
00:03:04,544 --> 00:03:08,514
data, feature engineering and
exploration and understanding

60
00:03:08,514 --> 00:03:10,289
these patterns and relationships.

61
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:11,519
Relationships and data.

62
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:14,269
Predictive modeling, your
traditional training machine

63
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:16,459
learning models to make forecasts.

64
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:20,199
And finally the data visualization,
where you're presenting these insights

65
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:23,999
to stakeholders and your clients and
whether they might be, while this

66
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:28,769
workflow is well established and all good,
it's really centered around structured

67
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:31,109
data and predictive ana analysis.

68
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,679
Now, let's see how this is.

69
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:36,199
Com is, Is in comparison with
the right side, which looks

70
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,459
at the generative AI workflow.

71
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:41,949
Generative AI introduces a different
approach focusing on creation.

72
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:44,589
Like we mentioned before,
we still have the business

73
00:03:44,589 --> 00:03:45,969
understanding, which is crucial.

74
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,779
We need to know, how to, forecast
this understanding of the data.

75
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:54,189
But now we frame these problems in terms
of generation, not just prediction.

76
00:03:55,179 --> 00:03:56,559
And prompt engineering.

77
00:03:56,979 --> 00:04:00,279
The new feature engineering, let's
say, crafting prompts effectively

78
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:04,269
to guide these AI models, we also
have to give it relevant context.

79
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:08,659
So instead of your traditional labeled
data sets, gen AI relies on context

80
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:11,539
embeddings and training data relevance.

81
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:13,369
And we also have this.

82
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:19,154
Fine tuning element, which, we fine
tune these AI models, to give outposts

83
00:04:19,544 --> 00:04:21,834
to our domains that we, highlighted.

84
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:24,474
And finally, we do this evaluation.

85
00:04:24,774 --> 00:04:28,614
New ways of assessing AI generated
content, ensuring coherence,

86
00:04:28,764 --> 00:04:31,074
correctness, and ethical consideration.

87
00:04:31,574 --> 00:04:34,924
So just to summarize this, AI
workflows are evolving from predictive

88
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:36,994
analysis to generative capabilities.

89
00:04:37,384 --> 00:04:41,044
And understanding the shift is
the key to leveraging AI's full

90
00:04:41,044 --> 00:04:43,384
potential in real world applications.

91
00:04:43,624 --> 00:04:44,374
More on that later.

92
00:04:44,874 --> 00:04:49,014
However, with every breakthrough
comes concern, let's address some of

93
00:04:49,014 --> 00:04:52,674
these biggest challenges data science
face in this new AI driven world,

94
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:54,354
and even some of these workflows.

95
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:56,804
This slide really addresses
the elephant in the room.

96
00:04:57,524 --> 00:05:01,064
Many data scientists are genuinely
worried about how genes AI

97
00:05:01,274 --> 00:05:02,384
might impact their careers.

98
00:05:02,814 --> 00:05:07,644
how we share, shared that the slide before
on how it's really automated this process.

99
00:05:08,144 --> 00:05:12,314
Some might fear that is doing
everything that, that we're doing

100
00:05:12,314 --> 00:05:14,054
essentially, but that's not the point.

101
00:05:14,474 --> 00:05:18,254
And some of the points that data
scientists have put across is, These

102
00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:21,884
models can analyze complex data sets
and produce insights in minutes that

103
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:25,944
might have taken days previously that,
we used to, without even seeing cases

104
00:05:25,944 --> 00:05:31,074
where companies are using models to,
to replace custom machine learning

105
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:35,314
models that data sets used to work on,
for certain tasks like classification

106
00:05:35,314 --> 00:05:37,054
or sentiment analysis, for example.

107
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:40,824
And, from the slide earlier, once again.

108
00:05:40,859 --> 00:05:46,489
And the routine tasks like, data cleaning
and analysis, and even feature engineering

109
00:05:46,549 --> 00:05:48,499
are increasingly becoming more automated.

110
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:52,579
While some fair AI could
replace data scientists, the

111
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:54,379
reality is quite different.

112
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,189
I'm going to pass onto Nain who will
showcase how generative AI is proving to

113
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:05,769
be an incredibly powerful partner rather
than a competitor over to, Thank you Umer.

114
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:09,569
So there are a lot of concern related
to generative AI and rightly Generative

115
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:13,139
AI is a powerful technology that
can do a lot of tasks we used to do.

116
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:16,919
It can fill in the missing
values in data, find anomalies

117
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,509
in data, and even label the data.

118
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:23,249
But think about it, it can do
all of this mundane tasks, thus

119
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,579
leaving us data scientists time to
focus on actual model development.

120
00:06:27,314 --> 00:06:30,764
And even more, it can help us in
accelerate the model development,

121
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:33,794
for example, by suggesting
us some hyper parameters.

122
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,464
It can help us reach optimization faster.

123
00:06:37,244 --> 00:06:40,304
And let's be honest, how many times
we have been in this scenario where

124
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:44,354
we did not have enough data or the
right data, but now that we have

125
00:06:44,354 --> 00:06:49,814
generative AI was able to generate
data, we can bring ideas to life sooner.

126
00:06:50,174 --> 00:06:54,884
So I'm here to say that data scientists
and JF AI are a powerful dynamic duo.

127
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:58,229
And I'm gonna go through some of the
project where data scientists have used in

128
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:02,969
native AI to accelerate the project build
and open opportunities for our clients.

129
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,409
Let's dive in.

130
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:11,729
Our first project, example is
WA, is was with a finance client.

131
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:15,179
The client had a marketing team
who tested out different marketing

132
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:16,799
strategy with different focus group.

133
00:07:17,549 --> 00:07:20,849
The problem was that finding right
people for a focus group was difficult.

134
00:07:21,464 --> 00:07:24,404
And furthermore, the marketing team
had to test all the strategy, multiple

135
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:28,994
time with different focus group, and
getting those people were hot overall.

136
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:32,534
This was a very time consuming
and resource intensive process.

137
00:07:33,164 --> 00:07:34,784
So how did we help them?

138
00:07:34,964 --> 00:07:39,334
While we use generative AI to, create
customer personas on the writing

139
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,254
side, you can see one of the example.

140
00:07:41,554 --> 00:07:46,534
We have Sandy, who is 28 years old, single
mother, and she's a teacher assistant.

141
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,534
This persona was generated
by generative ai.

142
00:07:49,954 --> 00:07:51,304
And how did we achieve that?

143
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:55,004
we had a team of data scientists,
firstly, who identify appropriate

144
00:07:55,004 --> 00:07:56,204
model for this problem.

145
00:07:56,264 --> 00:07:58,334
We use IBM Grite model for this.

146
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:03,104
Then the team gathered real customer
data and fed it to the model.

147
00:08:03,824 --> 00:08:07,214
The generative AI was able to analyze
the trends in behavior of the customer

148
00:08:07,214 --> 00:08:09,584
data and create the different personas.

149
00:08:09,974 --> 00:08:13,124
And lastly, we had the data team,
again, validate the persona to

150
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:17,114
make sure they represented or they
were near the CU real customers.

151
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:21,764
And now that we had a model able
to generate personas, a client can

152
00:08:21,764 --> 00:08:24,385
simulate multiple, focus group.

153
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:28,525
They can take out, try out their
board and innovative strategy with

154
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:33,115
this simulated focus group and thus
open lot of opportunities for them.

155
00:08:33,615 --> 00:08:37,815
second example is something we all come
across commonly not having enough data.

156
00:08:38,315 --> 00:08:40,895
for this, we had a client who
dealt with heavy machinery on

157
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,695
site and they were ready for,
focus on the hoisting operation.

158
00:08:45,265 --> 00:08:50,945
They had large lift who offload and,
unloaded heavy materials, and they were

159
00:08:50,945 --> 00:08:54,995
concerned that these lifts were not used
efficiently and thus it was costing them.

160
00:08:55,415 --> 00:08:59,315
They was also concern that these, lists
were used by personnel and they wanted

161
00:08:59,315 --> 00:09:01,800
to make sure, safety of these personnels.

162
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,275
And they wanted our help in that.

163
00:09:04,395 --> 00:09:05,865
So how did we do it?

164
00:09:06,315 --> 00:09:10,245
Firstly, they gave us some sensor
data and images of the site.

165
00:09:10,845 --> 00:09:14,595
And when we analyzed the, images, we
realized we don't have enough data.

166
00:09:15,345 --> 00:09:18,705
So what we did, we
augmented the images we use.

167
00:09:18,705 --> 00:09:24,795
IBM Max Visual Expect, max Maximum
Visual Expect is a platform that have

168
00:09:24,795 --> 00:09:28,425
computer vision and deep learning
and it allows you to train label.

169
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:31,245
And deploy models.

170
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:35,235
we had a data team who
augmented these images.

171
00:09:35,295 --> 00:09:38,295
Of course, they choose what
kind of augmentation appropriate

172
00:09:38,295 --> 00:09:43,395
for this project, and then we
were able to create new images.

173
00:09:43,605 --> 00:09:48,615
Now that we had new created images
and sensor data, we were able to

174
00:09:48,615 --> 00:09:53,295
simulate scenarios and identify
future risk and thus have a threat,

175
00:09:53,445 --> 00:09:55,095
threat detection mechanism in place.

176
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,680
And also with these scenarios,
we were able to identify the most

177
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:03,030
optimized way of using this lift,
thus increasing efficiency and

178
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,590
reducing cost for our client.

179
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:10,610
Next example is not related to a project,
but I do it for any project in IBM.

180
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:12,755
We have to work with different domains.

181
00:10:12,755 --> 00:10:14,615
For example, one day we
are working with retail.

182
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,045
One day we are working with
finance, and one day we are

183
00:10:17,045 --> 00:10:20,495
working with telecommunication
and getting my head around the

184
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,685
domain can be very overwhelming.

185
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:26,535
I remember a particular project, it
was for a telecommunication company.

186
00:10:26,535 --> 00:10:30,315
They gave us cell tower data and
they wanted to predict future

187
00:10:30,315 --> 00:10:31,845
congestion, cell tower congestion.

188
00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:36,515
They also give us a large document
and a mathematical formula on how they

189
00:10:36,515 --> 00:10:38,165
manually calculate congestion currently.

190
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:42,335
And for me to understand those,
that document was very difficult.

191
00:10:42,335 --> 00:10:44,885
It had so many terminologies
I never heard of.

192
00:10:45,105 --> 00:10:47,085
what does QOS means?

193
00:10:47,805 --> 00:10:52,395
So over here I use generative AI
to simplify the complex concept.

194
00:10:52,725 --> 00:10:56,685
I also use it to summarize the
mathematical formula and make it more

195
00:10:56,685 --> 00:11:00,945
understandable for me and even give,
do initial analysis of the data.

196
00:11:01,515 --> 00:11:04,785
And because of that, I got my
head around the domain quite fast.

197
00:11:05,715 --> 00:11:10,545
Seeing that generative AI did help give
me basic level of guidance, but I still

198
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,095
had to use my expertise to make decision.

199
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:17,415
For example, when I ask you what are the
KPIs that I should use for cell tower

200
00:11:17,445 --> 00:11:22,335
congestion, it said, one of the kpi, like
successful handshake, but the data in

201
00:11:22,335 --> 00:11:25,005
our, that we received wasn't relevant.

202
00:11:25,335 --> 00:11:28,365
So again, you still, I still had
to use my expertise to make the

203
00:11:28,365 --> 00:11:29,775
right decision for the project.

204
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:34,505
For our next project, and this is
very close to me, it is, was with a

205
00:11:34,505 --> 00:11:36,365
company that dealt with contracts.

206
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:42,125
So they wanted to use generative AI
to generate clauses for the contracts.

207
00:11:42,515 --> 00:11:46,535
The way it happened was the company
had templates for a contract,

208
00:11:46,535 --> 00:11:50,675
for example, it'll have a start
date, end date, termination

209
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:52,505
clause, culpable, and so forth.

210
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:56,425
And based on the different client,
they would alter the contract.

211
00:11:56,455 --> 00:12:00,775
For example, they might have a client
that does not need ANM ity clause, so

212
00:12:00,775 --> 00:12:02,455
they won't need to add it in the contract.

213
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:07,315
So they were, they wanted to use
the native AI to make these changes.

214
00:12:08,035 --> 00:12:09,505
So how did we do it?

215
00:12:09,565 --> 00:12:13,555
We, again, we had a data team who
provided generative AI with the

216
00:12:13,555 --> 00:12:17,695
temp, template of the contracts
and write the appropriate prompt.

217
00:12:18,355 --> 00:12:22,285
What we were analyzing was,
what we observed was that the

218
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:24,205
generative AI was too wordy.

219
00:12:24,805 --> 00:12:27,805
It was adding extra
information that wasn't needed.

220
00:12:28,195 --> 00:12:30,745
And again, over here we need data.

221
00:12:30,795 --> 00:12:34,605
scientists who kept on improving
the result iterated throughout the

222
00:12:34,605 --> 00:12:36,375
project to get the final output.

223
00:12:37,335 --> 00:12:40,665
So we do definitely need data science.

224
00:12:40,665 --> 00:12:41,085
Don't be.

225
00:12:41,585 --> 00:12:45,665
Generative AI is a incredible,
powerful and transformative

226
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:48,575
technology revolution the way we work.

227
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:54,185
But we still need the human
oversight and expertise to get

228
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:55,955
the most out of the generative ai.

229
00:12:56,285 --> 00:13:00,275
And we need the human creativity
and insight to make appropriate

230
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:01,715
decision for a project.

231
00:13:02,045 --> 00:13:05,795
And overall generative AI is here
to elevate us, nor replace it.

232
00:13:06,295 --> 00:13:09,145
And now I will pass it on to
ER, who will talk about the

233
00:13:09,145 --> 00:13:11,185
emerging trend in generative ai.

234
00:13:11,365 --> 00:13:11,815
Thank you, Darin.

235
00:13:12,655 --> 00:13:15,805
Now that we've touched upon some of
the experiences and impact lessons

236
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:20,395
with generative AI as data scientists,
it's to see what the future holds

237
00:13:20,395 --> 00:13:23,290
and what's next with generative
AI and emerging trends within it.

238
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,720
One we're seeing quite often and more
recent is the use of multimodal models,

239
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:34,500
but for specific use cases, for instance,
watsonx, our own data and AI platform

240
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,140
is able to host many AI systems that
can analyze both texts and images.

241
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:46,260
and one example was with a project where
we had to utilize medical reports to

242
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,430
create more comprehensive DI diagnosis,
and we were able to pick out the right.

243
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,770
Multimodal model for that use case.

244
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,410
Another one was the, another one.

245
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,460
Trend is the reinforcement
learning in Geneva.

246
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,790
And this is where, reinforcement
learning acts as a feed feedback

247
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:06,750
mechanism that allows the generative
model to continuously improve this

248
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,600
output by learning from rewards and
through trial and error essentially.

249
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,560
and we're seeing this, for example, in
a lot of these models like deep Seek

250
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:19,030
and Chat GBT, that use reinforcement
learning to improve responses over time.

251
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:24,955
Offering more, a more comprehensive and,
contextually relevant answer to the user.

252
00:14:25,455 --> 00:14:28,245
And finally, the most important
one I think, is open source

253
00:14:28,245 --> 00:14:30,705
ai, the increased availability.

254
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:35,945
And, I. General accessibility and
collaboration to these models is what will

255
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:41,655
create the gap and allow those to really
make use of, the future of generative ai.

256
00:14:42,585 --> 00:14:45,435
and really the future of generative
AI is going to be more interactive,

257
00:14:45,525 --> 00:14:50,715
adaptable, and multimodal, allowing new
possibilities and applications across a

258
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:52,815
variety of industries that we've covered.

259
00:14:53,315 --> 00:14:56,505
Now that we've looked ahead,
the real question is, what

260
00:14:56,505 --> 00:14:57,975
should you do to stay ahead?

261
00:14:58,475 --> 00:15:03,245
As a call to action, I can say
collaborate with ai, not against it,

262
00:15:04,145 --> 00:15:07,775
not compete with it, or rather to
utilize it to invest in your skills,

263
00:15:08,465 --> 00:15:11,975
whether that can be in research or
development, wherever it can be.

264
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:16,175
Invest in your skills in both AI and
utilize it to invest in your skills.

265
00:15:16,675 --> 00:15:18,385
Gene AI continues to evolve.

266
00:15:18,535 --> 00:15:20,875
It's clear that the future
is full of possibilities.

267
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,200
How will you embrace this change?

268
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,510
And with that, thank you very
much and we hope to see you again.
