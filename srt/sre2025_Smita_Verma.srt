00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,900
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:04,210
Good morning, good
afternoon, good evening.

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,390
Depending on where you are when you
are listening to this presentation.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm Smith Verma and I'm thrilled to
discuss how AI powered autonomous systems

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:18,370
are revolutionizing incident response
for site reliability engineering teams,

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:23,110
and how AI is transforming the way
the things are done, and by making a

7
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,750
significant impact on security landscape.

8
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:30,654
My goal for this session is to
explore the challenges of modern

9
00:00:30,654 --> 00:00:35,935
infrastructure, the transformation
role of AI in incident management,

10
00:00:36,205 --> 00:00:40,495
and then provide practical steps to
implement these systems effectively.

11
00:00:41,495 --> 00:00:43,535
So let's dive into the challenge.

12
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:49,685
In today's digital landscape, SRA,
teams are getting overwhelmed with

13
00:00:49,685 --> 00:00:54,120
the volume of alerts, sometimes
numbering in thousands per minute.

14
00:00:54,905 --> 00:01:00,455
Obviously with that many alerts, it's
nearly impossible to manually triage and

15
00:01:00,465 --> 00:01:06,105
respond to these alerts, especially when
mere minutes can mean the difference

16
00:01:06,105 --> 00:01:08,835
between stability and cascading failures.

17
00:01:09,705 --> 00:01:17,024
The complexity is further amplified by
the modern architecture, microservices,

18
00:01:17,175 --> 00:01:19,935
containers, hybrid cloud environments.

19
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,600
These technologies, while they
are powerful, but they introduce

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:31,620
interdependencies, that traditional
human-centric incident response model

21
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,380
struggle to manage even the most skilled
teams find it that challenging to

22
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,290
maintain system reliability at this scale.

23
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,725
Let's try to understand this
with a hypothetical situation.

24
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,580
When a microservice in a contra
containerized environment starts

25
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,470
exhibiting latency, the single issue
can ripple through dependent services

26
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,690
leading to widespread degradation.

27
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,390
If we were to manually identify and
mitigate such an issue between thousands

28
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,770
of alert, we can compare the situation
to finding a needle in a haystack.

29
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,870
So now let's talk about how
we can better the situation.

30
00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:19,515
So enter AI powered autonomous systems,
a paradigm shift in incident management.

31
00:02:20,204 --> 00:02:25,845
These system use advanced pattern
recognition to detect anomalies

32
00:02:25,935 --> 00:02:28,725
across vast and disparate data sets.

33
00:02:29,265 --> 00:02:33,120
Identifying subtle correlation
that is undetectable to

34
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,875
human operators in real time.

35
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,490
Beyond the detection, these systems
excel in intelligent classification,

36
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,640
assessing threats in within the context
to prioritize response effectively,

37
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:53,480
they can execute predefined playbooks
at machine speed, ensuring that there

38
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,315
is rapid mitigation of incidents.

39
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:01,250
Moreover, these con, the continuous
learning capabilities mean they

40
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,990
evolve with each incident, be
becoming more experienced over a time.

41
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,750
So let's take an example.

42
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:16,010
Imagine an AI system that detects unusual
pattern of database queries, which

43
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,890
indicates a potential SQ injection attack.

44
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:25,280
It classifies the threat, it blocks the
malicious IP and alerts the security team.

45
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,010
All within seconds, isn't it?

46
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:28,910
Just awesome.

47
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,950
Now, this doesn't end here.

48
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,910
The implementation of these
AI powered autonomous system,

49
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,785
the yield amazing results.

50
00:03:38,245 --> 00:03:39,625
So let's look at them closely.

51
00:03:40,905 --> 00:03:43,875
Let's talk about meantime
to resolution reduction.

52
00:03:44,505 --> 00:03:49,305
We have seen that organizations
have reported significant decrease

53
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:56,745
in meantime to resolution with
some achieving even 60% over 60%.

54
00:03:57,105 --> 00:04:02,385
This acceleration in resolution
time minimizes downtime and

55
00:04:02,385 --> 00:04:04,214
enhances user satisfaction.

56
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:06,855
Now let's talk about false positive.

57
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,920
These advanced AI systems,
they have achieved a false

58
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,380
positive rate as low as 5%.

59
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,190
Ensuring that alerts are
both accurate and actionable.

60
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,250
These precision reduces alert
fatigue and allows teams to focus

61
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,150
on genuine threats 24 7 coverage.

62
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:32,880
So unlike human operators AI systems,
they can provide continuous around

63
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,250
the clock monitoring without fatigue.

64
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:40,875
Ensuring that these incidents are detected
and addressed promptly at any hour.

65
00:04:41,685 --> 00:04:46,905
And last, but not the least, the return
on investment, the efficiency and accuracy

66
00:04:46,905 --> 00:04:52,344
of these systems, they translate to a
substantial ROI, with some organizations

67
00:04:52,374 --> 00:04:56,994
even witnessing a 95% return within
the first year of implementation.

68
00:04:57,984 --> 00:05:02,724
These metricses underscore the
profound impact of integrating AI

69
00:05:02,724 --> 00:05:05,034
into incident response workflows.

70
00:05:06,145 --> 00:05:11,874
Now imagine a situation where a
financial situa financial institution,

71
00:05:12,174 --> 00:05:17,064
they implement an AI driven incident
response system and observe a 60%

72
00:05:17,064 --> 00:05:26,185
reduction in MTTR, meantime to resolution
reduction and enhancing their service,

73
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:28,614
availability and customer trust.

74
00:05:29,305 --> 00:05:32,034
Wouldn't it be just
great for their business?

75
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:37,234
Modern autonomous systems, they're
equipped with sophisticated response

76
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:42,355
capabilities that were once the domain
of seasons human experts, network

77
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:47,855
segmentation, automatically isolating
Compromise network segments to prevent

78
00:05:47,855 --> 00:05:52,955
lateral movement of threats effectively
containing the potential breaches.

79
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:59,239
Container isis isolation, immediately
quarantine the suspicious containers

80
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:04,729
while maintaining service availability
through redundant in instances,

81
00:06:05,059 --> 00:06:10,339
ensuring that malicious activities
occurred without disrupting operations

82
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:12,919
dynamic resource allocation.

83
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:18,619
Intelligently redistributing compute
resources to maintain critical

84
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:23,509
service performances during incidents,
optimizing resource utilization

85
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:25,699
and ensuring service continuity.

86
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:31,979
Automatic rollbacks, just
instantaneously reverting to known

87
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,199
good configuration when deployment.

88
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,289
Trigger performance
degradation, minimizing the

89
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:40,019
impact of faulty deployments.

90
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:43,409
And the key advantage,
it lies in the speed.

91
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:49,829
These autonomous systems, they operate
at a machine timescales often containing

92
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:51,959
and mitigating threats within seconds.

93
00:06:53,549 --> 00:06:59,179
Example take an event of detected
malware outbreak within a container.

94
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:03,879
The system can automatic
autonomously, isolate the affected

95
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:08,589
container, deploy a clean instance,
and reroute traffic seamlessly.

96
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,409
That's such a great experience.

97
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:16,539
Now let's try to dive
deep into case studies.

98
00:07:18,489 --> 00:07:24,039
Let's examine a real world incident of
preventing cascading database failures.

99
00:07:24,414 --> 00:07:29,674
So in t plus zero seconds an anomalous
query pattern is detected in the primary

100
00:07:29,674 --> 00:07:33,304
database cluster in t plus 1.5 seconds.

101
00:07:33,304 --> 00:07:38,744
The AI system classifies this as a
potential resource exhaustion event.

102
00:07:39,614 --> 00:07:41,205
In t plus three seconds.

103
00:07:41,624 --> 00:07:45,960
An automatic query is throttling,
tottering is activated for

104
00:07:46,004 --> 00:07:51,565
noncritical services to alleviate
load in plus six seconds.

105
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:56,919
The re traffic is rerouted
to secondary replicas to

106
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:58,780
distribute the load effectively.

107
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:04,030
And then in D plus 30 seconds, an alert
is generated for the SRE team with

108
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,700
comprehensive diagnosis diagnostic data.

109
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:12,580
So in this scenario, the autonomous
system identified and mitigated the

110
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:18,849
threat within seconds, preserving the
system's availability and preventing

111
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,460
what could have been a major service.

112
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,519
Outage affecting millions of users.

113
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:30,649
And if you were to think of this in a real
world scenario, consider an e-commerce

114
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:33,169
platform during a peak sale event.

115
00:08:34,069 --> 00:08:38,389
An unexpected surge in database
queries could overwhelm the system.

116
00:08:38,569 --> 00:08:43,264
So an AI driven response can detect
the search, throttle the non-essential

117
00:08:43,504 --> 00:08:45,739
queries, and maintain service continuity.

118
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:50,060
Now let's take another case study.

119
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:52,569
Mitigating a zero day vulnerability.

120
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:58,959
So in another instance, a previously
unknown vulnerability was exploited

121
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,879
in a web application framework.

122
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:03,189
So a couple of things here.

123
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,619
We had behavior anomaly detection.

124
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:13,509
So the AI system, it identified unusual
process behavior across multiple instance

125
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:16,089
indicative of a potential compromise.

126
00:09:17,394 --> 00:09:19,104
Traffic pattern analysis.

127
00:09:19,164 --> 00:09:24,444
So they were able to co correlate
these anomalies with suspicious

128
00:09:24,444 --> 00:09:28,734
network connection, strengthening
the suspicion of malicious activity.

129
00:09:29,604 --> 00:09:34,974
Next, in the containment, the
isolated affected the isolated,

130
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,114
the affected containers.

131
00:09:36,684 --> 00:09:41,484
And implemented traffic filtering
rules to prevent further exploitation.

132
00:09:42,084 --> 00:09:44,304
And then forensic package creation.

133
00:09:44,304 --> 00:09:48,894
They generated comprehensive forensic
data for the security team to

134
00:09:48,894 --> 00:09:50,814
analyze and address the root cause.

135
00:09:51,654 --> 00:09:56,664
The rapid autonomous response that,
that contained the attack before the

136
00:09:56,664 --> 00:10:02,934
sensitive data was exfiltrated showcasing,
showcases the critical advantage of

137
00:10:03,054 --> 00:10:07,464
behavior based detection over the
traditional signature based approaches.

138
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:13,064
Now, if I were to think about this
from a real world example think of a

139
00:10:13,064 --> 00:10:18,555
tech company which has faced a zero day
exploit targeting their web servers.

140
00:10:19,064 --> 00:10:25,214
An AI driven system would be able to
detect irregular server behaviors, isolate

141
00:10:25,214 --> 00:10:31,844
the compromised instance, and provide
detailed logs for forensic anana analysis

142
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,484
effectively neutralizing the threat.

143
00:10:37,155 --> 00:10:41,084
Now let's talk about implementing
challenges, implementation

144
00:10:41,084 --> 00:10:42,555
challenges, and solution.

145
00:10:43,334 --> 00:10:47,415
So implementing AI powered
autonomous incident response.

146
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:54,754
Is not as easy as, plugging in us on a
smart system and forgetting about it.

147
00:10:55,204 --> 00:10:58,684
So it requires thoughtful
planning and problem solving.

148
00:10:59,344 --> 00:11:03,834
So let's just talk through the top
three challenges that we have seen

149
00:11:04,044 --> 00:11:07,924
that businesses face and what are
the strategies to overcome them.

150
00:11:09,124 --> 00:11:11,854
So the first one is algorithm reliability.

151
00:11:12,574 --> 00:11:14,675
So the toughest challenge is trust, right?

152
00:11:15,064 --> 00:11:19,234
These systems, they are making
decisions during high stake incidents.

153
00:11:19,775 --> 00:11:23,370
What happens if the model faces
something it has never seen before?

154
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,720
So we can mitigate this by
introducing confidence scoring.

155
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,520
If a model is uncertain, the system
will es escalate the incident

156
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,320
to a human rather than guessing.

157
00:11:35,355 --> 00:11:40,125
Additionally, we continuously
retrain models with fresh incident

158
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:45,555
data and regularly run adversial
test to make sure that the system

159
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:47,895
is resilient to the edge cases.

160
00:11:49,305 --> 00:11:51,685
Next is integration complexities.

161
00:11:52,195 --> 00:11:56,065
So most companies, they don't have
a single source of monitoring truth.

162
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:01,465
Instead, they use a patchwork of
tools across different environments.

163
00:12:02,485 --> 00:12:08,995
We address this by building
standardized API adapters for all major

164
00:12:09,085 --> 00:12:11,335
observability and logging platforms.

165
00:12:11,995 --> 00:12:17,095
We also roll out integration in
read-only observation mode at first.

166
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:22,405
This gives the team a chance to
evaluate the AI performance without

167
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:27,855
risking the unintended actions and
the third piece is human oversight.

168
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,750
So we don't want to replace SREs.

169
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,770
We want to free them from the noise
so they can focus on what matters.

170
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,230
We apply a tired tiered
au autonomy framework.

171
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:44,090
So systems starts with minimal
authority and gradually earns

172
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,260
trust as they prove themselves.

173
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:52,530
Everything is auditable and the teams
always retain the ability to override

174
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,720
or reverse autonomous decisions.

175
00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:00,150
The challenges are real, but with the
right strategies, they are solvable.

176
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,960
Next, let's talk about maintaining
observability and transparency.

177
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,310
So transparency is the
foundational requirement.

178
00:13:10,075 --> 00:13:14,785
SREs doesn't, don't understand
how a system made a decision.

179
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:19,375
They will never trust it no matter
how accurate it's, so we use three

180
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,265
pillars to maintain the transparency.

181
00:13:21,895 --> 00:13:27,445
The decision tracing, which means that
every automate automated action is

182
00:13:27,445 --> 00:13:31,855
logged in full details, including the
input signals, the confidence scores,

183
00:13:31,855 --> 00:13:33,925
and the logic or the model that is used.

184
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:41,275
This enables SREs to trace any incident
postmortem and understand exactly what

185
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:44,605
the system saw and why it acted that way.

186
00:13:45,745 --> 00:13:47,725
Next is explainable ai.

187
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:53,185
So we have implemented visual tools
that break down complex decisions into

188
00:13:53,185 --> 00:13:55,525
digestible human readable formats.

189
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:01,015
This might include a heat map of
signal anomalies, a decision tree

190
00:14:01,015 --> 00:14:06,535
visualization, or an incident replay
that shows how the event unfolded.

191
00:14:07,255 --> 00:14:12,925
These tools built trust and they also
help identify areas to refine the ai.

192
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,950
And third human AI
collaboration interfaces.

193
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,530
So we don't want AI in a black box.

194
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:25,780
Our dashboard will surface every
autonomous action, explain its

195
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:31,250
relational rational, and allow
one click override or adjustments.

196
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,300
This creates a partnership between
automation and human judgment.

197
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:40,460
The system handles routine noise and the
SREs focus on strategy and edge cases.

198
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:45,320
Ultimately, our goal is to create
AI that's just not powerful, but

199
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,060
understandable and accountable.

200
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,030
Now let's talk about
implementation roadmap.

201
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:56,610
So let's walk through the roadmap of
rolling out autonomous incident response

202
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,200
in a safe and scalable way safe.

203
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,760
So this is a blueprint that
we have successfully used

204
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,960
in enterprise environments.

205
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,750
So the first phase is
the assessment phase.

206
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:13,500
So here we start by cataloging incident
types and current response workflows.

207
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:18,580
So look for patterns where, you
know high volume, low risk events

208
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,860
that could be safely automated.

209
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,070
Next, monitoring enhancements.

210
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,700
So before we automate
anything, we need visibility.

211
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,150
So this phase will focus
on improving telemetry.

212
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:36,550
Adding richer signals, reducing noise,
and tagging data for better context.

213
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,640
Then passive learning mode.

214
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,720
So deploy AI systems in
observation only mode.

215
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,880
They watch incidents, they make
predictions and generate recommendations,

216
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,280
but they don't take any actions yet.

217
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,610
This phase is critical for trust building.

218
00:15:55,180 --> 00:16:00,550
Teams can compare the system's suggested
responses against actual outcomes,

219
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:06,370
and start to validate the value of
the AI supervised AU automation.

220
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:11,710
So once the confidence is high,
begin allowing the system to take

221
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,710
actions, but only with human approval.

222
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,980
This is like supervised driving for ai.

223
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,800
SRA still have a hand on the wheel.

224
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:25,135
And then last step is full autonomy.

225
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:30,255
So as a system earns trust,
expands its expand its au autonomy

226
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:32,655
for, understood incidents.

227
00:16:32,745 --> 00:16:37,365
So the goal is not to automate
everything at once, but to scale

228
00:16:37,365 --> 00:16:40,085
up and safely and progressively.

229
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:47,165
So each phase is designed to manage risk
while building confidence and capability.

230
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:53,245
So let's talk about key takeaways
and next steps and wrap up with that.

231
00:16:53,725 --> 00:16:56,545
So one, speed is critical.

232
00:16:56,605 --> 00:17:01,825
So in complex systems, every second
counts and autonomous systems operate

233
00:17:01,825 --> 00:17:07,135
at machine time scales containing
incidents before human could even react.

234
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:10,705
And that's how we prevent
outages and protect customers.

235
00:17:11,785 --> 00:17:14,485
SM start small and scale fast.

236
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,915
So you need, you don't
need to boil the ocean.

237
00:17:17,405 --> 00:17:19,895
Start with narrow, understood use cases.

238
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:24,365
Maybe just automate responses
to disc space alerts.

239
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:29,675
And as the system proves itself,
expand to broader incident types.

240
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:32,195
And then human AI partnership.

241
00:17:32,675 --> 00:17:36,545
So this isn't, remember, this
isn't about replacing sre,

242
00:17:37,415 --> 00:17:39,005
this is about elevating them.

243
00:17:40,145 --> 00:17:44,255
Removing repetitive firefighting so
that they can focus on architecture,

244
00:17:44,255 --> 00:17:45,845
reliability, and innovation.

245
00:17:46,235 --> 00:17:48,395
And the AI becomes a force multiplier.

246
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:53,525
Measure everything like, from
false positive rates to time to

247
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:59,705
resolution Metrics are essential
for demonstrating that ROI and

248
00:17:59,765 --> 00:18:01,625
guiding continuous improvements.

249
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:05,585
If you can't measure, you can't
trust it, you can't improve it.

250
00:18:05,975 --> 00:18:07,715
So measurement is very important.

251
00:18:08,705 --> 00:18:11,775
Next steps identify high volume incidents.

252
00:18:11,835 --> 00:18:17,685
Deploy AI in observation mode, build
trust before granting autonomy and

253
00:18:17,685 --> 00:18:19,605
focus on transparency and audit.

254
00:18:19,705 --> 00:18:24,055
Auditability autonomous incident
response is in the future.

255
00:18:24,085 --> 00:18:30,325
It's the present and it's how we scale
SRE to meet the complexity of systems.

256
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:31,975
To wrap up.

257
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:37,855
I wanna say autonomous instant response
isn't just a tech upgrade, it's a

258
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:42,505
strategic shift in how we protect,
scale and operate our systems.

259
00:18:42,925 --> 00:18:49,255
It's about moving from reactive
firefighting to proactive resilience.

260
00:18:49,735 --> 00:18:55,765
And with AI on our side, we no longer
are limited by human speed or scale.

261
00:18:56,545 --> 00:18:59,725
So if there's one message
that I want you to take.

262
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,240
With you today.

263
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,980
It is that smart.

264
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,910
Start small, start safely, but start now.

265
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:11,200
The future of SRE is
here and it's autonomous.

266
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,140
Thank you very much for your time.

267
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,580
I'm very happy to take questions or
chat more, so feel free to reach out

268
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,520
to me and once again, thank you a lot.

269
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,870
Thanks a lot for your time today.
