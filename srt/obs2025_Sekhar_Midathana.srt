1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,640
Hi, this is Sheika Ana.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,590
Welcome to conference 42.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,600
Today I'm here to present about
unlocking operational efficiency

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,220
and collaboration in nonprofit
with Salesforce nonprofit cloud.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,480
There are some of the key
non-profit challenges today.

6
00:00:19,034 --> 00:00:25,004
One is like time constraints, data silos,
and communication gap time constraints.

7
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:29,054
Nonprofit often find themselves
to stretch with the limited budget

8
00:00:29,054 --> 00:00:34,035
and the staff and the constant
pressure to do more with the less.

9
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:40,270
Can be overwhelmed, like time, valuable
time, and the resources get consumed

10
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:45,755
in administrative tasks like manual
data entry and some other manual,

11
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:49,865
manual work and leaving like less
times for the mission critical works.

12
00:00:49,865 --> 00:00:54,695
And the program delivery this time
crunches or takes away from the

13
00:00:54,695 --> 00:01:00,155
organization ability to focus on the
core purpose and maximize its impact.

14
00:01:00,635 --> 00:01:07,185
And when it comes to data silos, main,
many nonprofit relies on patchworks to

15
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:12,495
spread the system and the tools to manage
their operations from the donor management

16
00:01:12,495 --> 00:01:15,285
to program tracking to the outreach.

17
00:01:15,705 --> 00:01:20,895
This approach leads to the disjoint of
data, like making it difficult to get

18
00:01:21,105 --> 00:01:25,545
comprehensive view of an organization,
activities and communication gap.

19
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:30,315
The disconnect between various
teams and information sources with

20
00:01:30,315 --> 00:01:35,025
nonprofit can create like a significant
COL collaborative collaboration.

21
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:40,005
Challenges and program staff may
lack of a real time visibility

22
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:41,865
and outcomes and the performance.

23
00:01:42,075 --> 00:01:43,815
While leadership may struggle to.

24
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,800
Coordinate the efforts and the track,
the progress of across the organization.

25
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,730
This lack of transparency and alignment
can be like co cross, cross-functional

26
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,080
collaboration prevents, like sharing
the best practices and make it harder

27
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,640
to demonstrate the organization
collective impact to the stakeholders.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,630
And this.

29
00:02:06,205 --> 00:02:10,045
This affects to the challenges can
be determined to the non-profit

30
00:02:10,074 --> 00:02:12,475
ability to fulfill its mission.

31
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:18,475
Donuts and inefficient use of
resources and critical funding can

32
00:02:18,475 --> 00:02:22,495
be undermined the organization in the
long term sustainability and impact.

33
00:02:22,795 --> 00:02:27,004
So today I want to introduce
a non-profit cloud which was

34
00:02:27,004 --> 00:02:28,534
provided by the Salesforce.

35
00:02:28,804 --> 00:02:30,574
So Salesforce non-profit cloud.

36
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:36,254
Assess these pain points by providing
like undefined cloud-based platform that

37
00:02:36,254 --> 00:02:41,259
breaks down the data silos, automates
the manual processes, and crossed.

38
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,089
Sorry.

39
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:44,879
Cross team collaboration
and real time visibility.

40
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:51,069
This empowerment of a nonprofit free
up the time, resources and improve the

41
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:57,629
donors valuable time and demonstrate a
measurable outcomes, ultimately helping

42
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:02,009
them overcome their unit challenges
and unlock their full potential.

43
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:08,344
Like purpose of a platform built platform
like Salesforce, nonprofit, cloud is

44
00:03:08,344 --> 00:03:13,834
comprehensive and a cloud-based platform
designed specifically to the unique

45
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:16,574
needs of a nonprofit sector sectors.

46
00:03:16,674 --> 00:03:21,674
It goes beyond generic CRM solutions
offered and a set of features and

47
00:03:21,674 --> 00:03:25,664
the functionalities that address
in the common pain point faced by

48
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,274
non-profit organization like this.

49
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:33,284
Purpose of built approach ensures
non-profit Cloud provides the right

50
00:03:33,284 --> 00:03:38,234
tools and capabilities to help
non-profits non-profits streamline

51
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:39,859
their operations and enhance.

52
00:03:40,474 --> 00:03:42,144
The donor consistency.

53
00:03:42,144 --> 00:03:45,534
Engagement, and demonstrate
the measurable impacts.

54
00:03:45,924 --> 00:03:50,634
And the platform is deeply aligned with
the nonprofit missions, empowering them

55
00:03:50,634 --> 00:03:52,944
to work more efficiently and effectively.

56
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:56,904
And this is like cloud-based
solution, like Salesforce.

57
00:03:56,904 --> 00:04:00,744
Nonprofit is a cloud-based
platform, which means it's hosted

58
00:04:00,744 --> 00:04:03,234
and maintained by Salesforce and.

59
00:04:04,074 --> 00:04:08,274
This offers several key advantages
of a non-profit like accessibility.

60
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:12,174
Accessibility, meaning like the
platform can access from anywhere

61
00:04:12,174 --> 00:04:16,104
or any device, and enabling a
remote and mobile collaboration.

62
00:04:16,554 --> 00:04:17,994
Another one is scalability.

63
00:04:18,654 --> 00:04:21,894
The cloud-based infrastructure
can easily accommodate.

64
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:28,169
A growth and changing the needs with
the burden and the hardware of it.

65
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:32,819
Maintenance and reliability, like
Salesforce's industry leading cloud

66
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:37,169
infrastructure ensures the high
availability and secure and disaster

67
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:42,304
recovery, giving a nonprofit peace
of mind and automatic updates.

68
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:47,569
The platform is continuously updated
with the latest features and the security

69
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:52,699
enhancements, keeping nonprofit up
to date with the need for the manual.

70
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:58,339
Manual upgrades and customizable
system like Salesforce, not nonprofit.

71
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:03,919
Cloud is highly customizable
platform, allowing like a non-profit.

72
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:05,899
To its specific requirements.

73
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:10,939
And this flexibility ensures that
the system aligns with organization

74
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:14,809
of a unique workflow, data needs
and reporting requirements.

75
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,869
And nonprofit can configure the platform
to match their branding, streamline

76
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:23,609
and their operational pro processes.

77
00:05:23,609 --> 00:05:23,939
And.

78
00:05:24,284 --> 00:05:26,714
Integrate with other critical systems.

79
00:05:27,044 --> 00:05:31,364
They use this level of customization,
empowers them the maximum value

80
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:36,914
of the platform, and ensure a
seamless fit with their existing

81
00:05:36,914 --> 00:05:39,044
infrastructure way of working.

82
00:05:39,794 --> 00:05:42,944
And by providing the purpose of built.

83
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:49,989
Our cloud-based customizable solution,
Salesforce nonprofit Cloud helps overcome

84
00:05:49,989 --> 00:05:54,399
the challenges and timely constraints
of data silos and communication gaps,

85
00:05:54,399 --> 00:06:00,129
and ultimately enabling them focus
on their mission-driven impacts.

86
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,699
And the next slide, which I'm talking
about streamlining our operations

87
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:10,409
Salesforce nonprofit cloud can
help streamlining operations by.

88
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,269
Automate the task.

89
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:17,309
Automate task means automates many
manual time consuming tasks that

90
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:21,869
often burden a nonprofit organization
like from donor management or

91
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:23,519
fundraising to the volunteer.

92
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:28,094
Coordination and program management
and the platform can streamline

93
00:06:28,094 --> 00:06:32,864
these processes and eliminate
the needs and the data entry.

94
00:06:33,164 --> 00:06:37,454
For example, the platform can
continuously, can automatically

95
00:06:37,454 --> 00:06:42,584
generate the donor donation receipts
and schedule reoccurring donor payments

96
00:06:42,884 --> 00:06:45,554
and send a personalized acknowledgement.

97
00:06:46,334 --> 00:06:51,484
This free of the valuable staff time
to ensure like consistent, efficient,

98
00:06:51,484 --> 00:06:55,774
handle way handling the critical
administrative responsibilities.

99
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:57,454
And the other one is
tracking the progress.

100
00:06:57,454 --> 00:07:01,804
Like nonprofit Cloud provides
centralized hub to tracking the

101
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:06,974
organization progress and perform
across all the programs innovatively.

102
00:07:07,214 --> 00:07:11,594
And this platform offers the real time
dashboards and reporting tools that

103
00:07:11,594 --> 00:07:13,124
can give the stakeholders from the.

104

Program manager to execute leadership
and comprehensive reporting and the

105
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:23,749
key and comprehensive key view of a
key metrics and outcomes like this.

106
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:25,604
Visibility allows the
nonprofit to monitor.

107
00:07:26,104 --> 00:07:30,544
The impact of their program and
identify the areas to improve and

108
00:07:30,544 --> 00:07:34,774
make the data driven decisions
to enhance their effectiveness.

109
00:07:35,014 --> 00:07:39,214
Like tracking the progress also
enables like nonprofit to better

110
00:07:39,214 --> 00:07:44,764
communicate to their impact donor and
grant makers and other stakeholders.

111
00:07:45,155 --> 00:07:49,504
Other one is the find information
with all of the organization data.

112
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:54,829
And the information stored in a single
place like Unified Platform Salesforce

113
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:58,849
nonprofit Cloud can make it easy for
the staff, like to quickly find the

114
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:03,709
information they need, whether the donor
contact details or program outcomes or

115
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:09,199
the volunteer engagement history and
the platform is a powerful like search

Ensure like critical data to.

118
00:08:13,804 --> 00:08:15,274
Do a read only accessible.

119
00:08:15,724 --> 00:08:20,284
And this streamline access of
information empowers like nonprofit

120
00:08:20,284 --> 00:08:26,374
team to collaborate more effectively
and make informed decisions and provide

121
00:08:26,374 --> 00:08:29,014
a better service to their consistents.

122
00:08:29,524 --> 00:08:32,734
Another one is like gendered
reports, like nonprofit cloud.

123
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:38,270
Was robust reporting and analytics
capability allows the organization to

124
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:43,190
generate comprehensive reports that
showcase their impact and performance.

125
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:49,069
And the platform offers a wide range of
prebuilt reports, templates as well, and

126
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:53,690
that ability to create a custom reports to
the organization for the specific needs.

127
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,159
And these reports can be used to
demonstrate organization progress.

128
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:03,185
To the donors or grant makers and
other stakeholders, like helping secure

129
00:09:03,185 --> 00:09:07,264
the critical fundings and support
additional, additionally, and the

130
00:09:07,264 --> 00:09:13,225

identify the trends and track the key

131
00:09:13,435 --> 00:09:17,575

data-driven adjustments to their program.

132
00:09:17,575 --> 00:09:24,055

tasks and tracking pro progress

133
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:26,335

134
00:09:26,905 --> 00:09:29,785
And generates the impactful
reports like Salesforce.

And this provides a more
personalized experience.

153

171
00:12:02,565 --> 00:12:07,305
donor characteristics and given
patterns and the area of interest.

172
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,480
This personalized approach helps
a nonprofit deep dive or the

173
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,470
relation with the donors and loyalty
and increase the likelihood to

174
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,360
repeat the increased donations.

175
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:23,390
The platform also provides the
visibility to the donor and allowing

176
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:28,420
nonprofit to proactively address any
donor concerns or or any given reports.

177
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,710
Like other one is like donor
reporting and analytics.

178
00:12:32,535 --> 00:12:37,115
Nonprofit nonprofit cloud robust
reporting analytics capabilities

179
00:12:37,145 --> 00:12:42,045
empowers the organization to gain the
deeper insight into the donor base.

180
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:47,315
And nonprofit can generate a comprehensive
donor reports track the key metrics such

181
00:12:47,315 --> 00:12:53,385
as donor life and value and accuse the
cost and identifying the trend and the

182
00:12:53,385 --> 00:12:55,305
opportunities of the donor engagement.

183
00:12:56,235 --> 00:13:01,185
These insights help the nonprofit to make
data-driven decisions and optimize their

184
00:13:01,185 --> 00:13:05,745
fundraising strategies and demonstrate
the impact of the donor outreach

185
00:13:05,745 --> 00:13:12,085
efforts to both current and potential
supporters By enhancing this engagement,

186
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:16,225
streamlining donation management,
and cultivating the donor relation,

187
00:13:16,535 --> 00:13:18,725
provide the actionable donor insight.

188
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:25,040
Salesforce nonprofit cloud helps the
nonprofit build stronger, more sustainable

189
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,930
Turner community that supports the
mission and drive the great impact.

190
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,700
And the next slide is about boost.

191
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,870
The team collaborate.

192
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,030
Like the Boost team collaborate is
like centralized data information.

193
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:44,210
Like a nonprofit provides the centralized
platform to store accessing all of an

194
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,670
organization data and the information.

195
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,080
This includes donor records,
program details, volunteering

196
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,970
information, and more.

197
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,100
By having a single unified system,
team member can easily find the data

198
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,510
they need to reduce the time spent
on searching across multiple systems.

199
00:14:02,855 --> 00:14:07,595
And the spreadsheets, like other one is
improve the visibility and transparency,

200
00:14:07,895 --> 00:14:12,485
like platform dashboards and reporting
tools offers the team like greater

201
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:16,985
visibility into the organization,
activities, progress and performance.

202
00:14:17,405 --> 00:14:22,565
This transparency allows for the better
alignment as everyone can see, the same

203
00:14:22,565 --> 00:14:26,525
data information, and understand the
organization priorities and the goals.

204
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:30,965
And other point is like enhanced
communication and coordination.

205
00:14:31,895 --> 00:14:36,795
Like nonprofit cloud collaborates
features such as task assignments and

206
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:41,805
activity feeds and real time updates and
enabling the teams to communicate more

207
00:14:41,805 --> 00:14:44,085
effectively and coordinate their efforts.

208
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:48,390
Team members can stay informed and
share updates and collaborate on the

209
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:51,970
projects and more aligned workforce.

210
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:57,130
And other point is like streamline
workflow process by automating many

211
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:01,820
administrative like by automating
many administrative processes.

212
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:06,095
By automating, standardized the
workflows and non-profit cloud helps

213
00:15:06,095 --> 00:15:08,620
the team to work more ev effectively.

214
00:15:09,215 --> 00:15:14,585
And this frees up the time and the
resource that can redirect it towards

215
00:15:14,585 --> 00:15:19,805
the mission and critical activities, and
further enhance the team, collaborative,

216
00:15:19,805 --> 00:15:22,745
and productivity, and integrate ecosystem.

217
00:15:23,245 --> 00:15:28,005
An integrated ecosystem like non-profit
cloud seamlessly integrates and

218
00:15:28,005 --> 00:15:31,485
by providing the centralized data
hub and improving the visibility

219
00:15:31,785 --> 00:15:36,015
and the transparency, enhance the
communication and coordinating the

220
00:15:36,015 --> 00:15:40,205
streaming workflow and integrate the
other essential tools like Salesforce.

221
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:44,495
Nonprofit Cloud helps the team
collaboratively and more effectively.

222
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:50,750
And ultimately driving the greater impact
and achieving their goals of like the

223
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,225
organization goals in a timely manner.

224
00:15:53,765 --> 00:15:55,465
And and the data.

225
00:15:55,525 --> 00:16:00,935
And the next slide is about the data
driven making organization that utilize

226
00:16:00,935 --> 00:16:05,615
a nonprofit consistently and experience
the significant improvement across

227
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:07,905
the essential performance metrics.

228
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:13,670
And this empowers the strategization
making, maximize the mission impact

229
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:19,120
and through the actionable insight
that donor re retention within an

230
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,390
organization is 45% with without
Salesforce, and 75 per 72% with

231
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:28,150
Salesforce, which is like 60% improvement.

232
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:35,680
And the program efficiency is
52% without Salesforce, and 83%

233
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,390
with Salesforce transforming.

234
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:44,365
Operations and the reporting speed is
38% without Salesforce, and 91% with

235
00:16:44,365 --> 00:16:49,275
Salesforce, which significantly reduce
the preparation time preparation time.

236
00:16:49,605 --> 00:16:56,385
And the other one is staff satisfaction
is 61% without Salesforce, and 85%

237
00:16:56,385 --> 00:17:02,045
with Salesforce enhance the team
moral morals and work in a better way.

238
00:17:02,545 --> 00:17:04,975
And the next slide is
about implementation.

239
00:17:04,975 --> 00:17:11,135
The journey of a Salesforce nonprofit
cloud includes includes so I split

240
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:13,765
this into different parts, like
one is the discovery and planning,

241
00:17:13,765 --> 00:17:18,235
meaning understanding the nonprofit
unique needs, goals, and the pain

242
00:17:18,235 --> 00:17:22,675
points to the deeply discovered
sessions with the key stakeholders.

243
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:26,665
And access the organization, current
technologies and the landscape, and

244
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:31,675
identify the areas of improvement
to integrate with the nonprofit

245
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:36,505
cloud, and develop the comprehensive
implementation plan and align

246
00:17:37,315 --> 00:17:39,025
with the nonprofit strategy.

247
00:17:39,345 --> 00:17:44,565
Objective timelines and define the project
scope, and identify the key milestones

248
00:17:44,835 --> 00:17:49,635
and clear the roles and establish
the clear roles and responsibilities

249
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:50,895
for the implementation team.

250
00:17:51,525 --> 00:17:56,535
And other one is like configuration
and setup, like customize, customize

251
00:17:56,535 --> 00:18:01,065
the nonprofit cloud to match the
organization's specific workflow and

252
00:18:01,065 --> 00:18:03,135
data requirements and reporting needs.

253
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:08,085
And other one is like migrating the
existing data from the legacy system

254
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:12,945
into nonprofit cloud and ensure
the data accuracy and integrity and

255
00:18:12,945 --> 00:18:14,625
integrate the nonprofit cloud with.

256
00:18:15,015 --> 00:18:19,335
Other relational tools systems
used by organizations such as

257
00:18:19,395 --> 00:18:23,745
online donation platform or
voluntary management softwares.

258
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:28,035
Another one is implement the robust,
secure measure, like user access

259
00:18:28,035 --> 00:18:32,325
control and data governance policies
to protect sensitive information.

260
00:18:32,715 --> 00:18:34,785
Another point is like
training and adoption.

261
00:18:35,565 --> 00:18:40,785
Like developing a comprehensive training
program to educate the nonprofit staff

262
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,915
on the Salesforce cloud platform.

263
00:18:43,275 --> 00:18:47,745
It features and the best practices
for utilization and provide ongoing

264
00:18:47,745 --> 00:18:52,695

smooth and transition and increase

265
00:18:52,695 --> 00:18:55,005
the user adoption and the ident.

266
00:18:55,035 --> 00:18:57,225
Identify the Empower super user.

267
00:18:57,615 --> 00:19:03,465
With the organization who can serve as
a champ and mentor of their colleagues

268
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:08,145
and gather the feedback and continuously
refine the training materials, use

269
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:12,825
support resource based on the other needs
and the feedback and ongoing support.

270
00:19:13,725 --> 00:19:17,775
Like establishing the dedicated support
team or a partnership with the Salesforce

271
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:22,605
implementation to provide ongoing
technical assistance and troubleshooting

272
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:28,705
and issue resolution and like continuously
monitoring the platform identify areas

273
00:19:28,705 --> 00:19:34,285
to improve or implement the enhancement
updates as needed, and provide the

274
00:19:34,285 --> 00:19:38,615
regular check-ins and the status
reviews to ensure the nonprofit platform

275
00:19:38,615 --> 00:19:40,925
continues to align with the organization.

276
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:45,170
And evolving goals and the
requirements, and offering the

277
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:49,370
ongoing trainings and the development
opportunities to help nonprofit staff

278
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,470
stay up to date with the platform.

279
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,210
Latest features and capabilities.

280
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:58,730
Like by carefully navigating through
these key stages, the implementation

281
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,310
journey of a nonprofit can ensure.

282
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:08,150

Key performance metrics.

295
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,360
And the next point is about results.

296
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,160

inequality of a consistency information

315
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:29,515
