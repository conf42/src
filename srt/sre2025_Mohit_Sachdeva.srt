00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,250
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:07,260
I'm Mova, and today I'm excited to talk
about how intelligent automation, which

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,909
is known as ia, come in combination with
business process management known as BPM.

4
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:17,589
It's transforming how we operate,
innovate, and deliver the value.

5
00:00:18,049 --> 00:00:20,369
this isn't, just about an automation.

6
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:24,509
It's about enabling strategic,
intelligent business evolution.

7
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:29,710
Coming to the next slide, it talks
about, global momentum and market trends.

8
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,740
so what we have seen in the recent,
Deloitte research, it shows that globally

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:40,140
73% of the organizations are already on
their intelligent automation journey.

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,280
58% are using AI to scale
automation platform.

11
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,080
and this just isn't a
trend, it's a moment.

12
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,600
In fact, we are seeing an ROI in
under a year for many organizations

13
00:00:53,780 --> 00:01:00,080
with 93% are reporting outcome that
meet or exceed their expectations.

14
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,040
also we have seen that 58% of
organization are scaling AI

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,350
enabled automation platform.

16
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,620
And the average, ROI time that
is achieved by most of the

17
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,470
organization is around 11 months.

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,050
coming to the next slide, here, I'll
talk about why intelligent automation

19
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,160
and business process management, is used.

20
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,550
so combining IA with BPM unlocks
real, process transformation.

21
00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:34,150
in terms of, process efficiency,
we are talking about reducing

22
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,640
the cycle time up to 90%.

23
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:43,630
IM improving the compliance, freeing and
it almost free up, 30% of employees, time

24
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,810
spent on normal day-to-day repeated task.

25
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,100
And this isn't just automation,
it's intelligent orchestration.

26
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:58,975
second about data utilization, real time
analytics with 80% faster data retrieval.

27
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,470
so BBPI, which is also
known as business process.

28
00:02:02,785 --> 00:02:09,755
Integration, it enables advance, data
utilization by ensuring consistency

29
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,365
across previously siloed application.

30
00:02:12,614 --> 00:02:16,124
and in terms of customer experience,
we have seen that there is a 20

31
00:02:16,124 --> 00:02:22,179
to 30%, increase in satisfaction
and 40 to 60% faster service.

32
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:26,930
Going to the next slide, which,
talks about the key benefits

33
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:28,910
of, using IEA with BPM.

34
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,230
And, what we have seen is the
impact is multidimensional here.

35
00:02:32,809 --> 00:02:35,250
better decision making,
through machine learning.

36
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:38,070
Improved customer experience
via natural language processing

37
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,250
and continuous optimization.

38
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,529
And it's not about,
replacing humans, right?

39
00:02:44,204 --> 00:02:49,934
but enhancing what they do best while
machines, handle, the day-to-day grant

40
00:02:50,024 --> 00:02:57,004
work, in terms of efficiency, process
cycle time reduces by almost 90%.

41
00:02:57,854 --> 00:03:01,614
second key benefit is,
regarding, decision making.

42
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,354
machine learning is a
real game changer here.

43
00:03:04,964 --> 00:03:08,714
it allows the BPM system
to adapt and optimization.

44
00:03:09,029 --> 00:03:14,169
On the fly, monitoring, analyzing, and
adjusting without manual intervention,

45
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:18,409
but still keeping humans in the loop,
for all the strategic oversight.

46
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:21,629
And that makes the
combination, very deadly.

47
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:25,429
third important benefit of
is the customer experience.

48
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:30,699
when we use IE to streamline
customer journeys, satisfaction

49
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:32,799
increases by up to 30%.

50
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:39,589
and conversational a ai I AI
understand emotional signal and context

51
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:45,069
leading to faster, more personalized
support and better brand loyalty.

52
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:49,089
coming to the next slide, which
shows about, what are the leading

53
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:52,089
tools used for I-N-B-P-M ecosystem.

54
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:56,279
some of the top layers include
UiPath, automation, anywhere,

55
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:58,979
cofaq, and, Pega Systems.

56
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,049
And each of these, tools have their
unique strengths, from document processing

57
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:10,259
to cognitive automation, to process
orchestration, and tool selection,

58
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:15,139
completely depends on your business
needs and the strategy, involved.

59
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:19,564
So UiPath, is a leader in
end-to-end automation with task

60
00:04:19,564 --> 00:04:21,334
process mining capabilities.

61
00:04:22,034 --> 00:04:26,834
coming to Automation Anywhere is a Cloud
Native 360 platform, which is scalable

62
00:04:26,894 --> 00:04:29,004
automation platform, Pega system.

63
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:32,549
They are very strong in orchestration
and case management, with Pega

64
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:37,999
Robotics and also they have, coverage
in mobile solutions, as well.

65
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:43,739
coming to coax, it's specialized
in document intensive process with

66
00:04:43,739 --> 00:04:47,249
RPA, along with very advanced OCR.

67
00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:51,909
coming to the next slide, which,
talks about, how in business process

68
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:54,129
selection and prioritization work.

69
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:58,729
so what we have observed is that
organization that focus on business value.

70
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:01,274
not just the technical ease.

71
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,434
See the most return.

72
00:05:03,574 --> 00:05:07,904
as you can see, that's occupying
the top slab in this pyramid.

73
00:05:08,404 --> 00:05:12,094
It starts with finance,
hr, or tax department.

74
00:05:12,584 --> 00:05:15,654
refer, transfer, transformation, use.

75
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:20,424
It also uses a formal selection
framework to ensure alignment

76
00:05:20,424 --> 00:05:21,894
with their strategic goals.

77
00:05:22,394 --> 00:05:27,744
The next slide, it talks about governance
framework, for i a and BPM integration.

78
00:05:28,374 --> 00:05:32,494
So this particular, slide talks
about a governance is important,

79
00:05:32,544 --> 00:05:36,084
for how the governance is
important for i a and BPM here.

80
00:05:36,114 --> 00:05:37,764
Governance is the key.

81
00:05:38,134 --> 00:05:44,344
69% of high performing organization
have automation centers of excellence.

82
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,954
Success really lies.

83
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:53,554
In balancing central standard with local
execution and defining very clear roles

84
00:05:53,674 --> 00:05:58,204
based on the business and technical
teams in order to excel beyond just the

85
00:05:58,564 --> 00:06:00,394
initial pilot projects that they have.

86
00:06:00,644 --> 00:06:04,244
the next slide, it's about the
change management essentials.

87
00:06:04,274 --> 00:06:05,354
how it is essential.

88
00:06:05,744 --> 00:06:08,534
So change management isn't
optional, it's foundational.

89
00:06:09,194 --> 00:06:11,984
it talks about how
involving your teams early.

90
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:16,829
if you communicate, clearly, share
clear information and be transparent,

91
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,179
communication on role impacts to
invest in reskilling of employees

92
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:24,249
for strategic skill development.

93
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:28,989
58%, which is a very high
number of leading organization

94
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,919
are already, doing this.

95
00:06:31,564 --> 00:06:32,644
And leading companies.

96
00:06:32,734 --> 00:06:38,594
around 42% redesign, workflow for
humans and machines to work together

97
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:42,844
not in isolation, which is covered
in, which is, usually covered in

98
00:06:42,844 --> 00:06:45,064
human machine collaboration framework.

99
00:06:45,314 --> 00:06:50,374
coming to the next slide, it talks about,
the technical architectural, foundation,

100
00:06:51,364 --> 00:06:53,714
a successful, IA and BPM stack.

101
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:58,529
Is modular, which is required
for adaptability with enterprise

102
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:00,749
wide standard for consistency.

103
00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:06,009
performance tracking and continuous
refinement through real time data

104
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,299
are vital for a, success offer.

105
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:15,429
IE and BPM system, with 47%, of
successful organization use process

106
00:07:15,429 --> 00:07:17,469
mining for continuous improvement.

107
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:20,589
coming to the next slide,
which, talks about the future

108
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:22,329
of intelligent automation.

109
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:27,859
so we are heading into a future
where hyper automation, integrating

110
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:32,999
ai, RPM, RPA, BPM, and analytics.

111
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:38,969
As process, as a part of process
intelligence, it uses deep analytics to

112
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:46,199
identify high value automation targets and
self-healing and adaptive workflow forms

113
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,869
part of their auto autonomous process.

114
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,489
with process intelligence in place
and collaboration, we go beyond

115
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:56,019
automation to transformation.

116
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:01,519
And, to conclude and final takeaway,
from this presentation, intelligent

117
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:04,519
automation isn't just a cost cutting tool.

118
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:11,109
It's a strategic capability for new bro,
business model and resilient operation.

119
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:16,099
they focus on end-to-end optimization,
not just the isolation tasks.

120
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:20,920
and usually what being seen
is the winner in this space.

121
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:22,359
Think beyond tasks.

122
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,849
They reimagine entire process
and build a future where machines

123
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:30,219
and human co-create the value.

124
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,799
I. So here I conclude.

125
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:33,959
thank you all for your
attention and listening in.

126
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:39,190
Hope, that you have gained some insights
about I a. Which is intelligent automation

127
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:44,200
combined with the Pro BPM and how it is
transforming and delivering the value.

128
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,000
Happy learning everyone.

129
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:46,600
Thank you.
