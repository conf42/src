through data driven insights.

174
00:11:03,234 --> 00:11:06,864
By improving order fulfillment,
reducing storage costs, and

175
00:11:06,864 --> 00:11:10,344
minimizing downtime, it streamlines
operations across the industry.

176
00:11:10,574 --> 00:11:15,874
The HANA Cloud with Generative AI
has further transformed the sector.

177
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:19,399
Transforming operational
efficiency across upstream,

178
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:21,359
midstream, and downstream segments.

179
00:11:21,859 --> 00:11:25,199
Let's discuss implementation
challenges and mitigation

180
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:26,799
strategies in SAP Cloud Adoption.

181
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:30,679
Transitioning to SAP Cloud
Solution offers transformative

182
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:34,519
benefits, but implementation comes
with its own set of challenges.

183
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:39,619
Let's explore three key hurdles businesses
face and how SAP advanced tools and

184
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,079
strategies effectively mitigate them.

185
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:47,219
First, data migration challenge,
legacy system contain inconsistency

186
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:52,149
data, incompatible format and
potential integrity risk, making

187
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:54,339
migration complex and time consuming.

188
00:11:55,009 --> 00:12:01,339
The mitigation strategy, SAP leverages
SAP Data Intelligence to automate data

189
00:12:01,349 --> 00:12:03,569
validation, cleansing and transformation.

190
00:12:03,969 --> 00:12:11,179
This approach achieves 99 percent data
accuracy, reduces mitigation time by 40%.

191
00:12:11,494 --> 00:12:16,564
ensures zero business disruption
by utilizing AI driven automation

192
00:12:16,574 --> 00:12:20,754
businesses can ensure smooth and
secure transition to SAP cloud

193
00:12:20,934 --> 00:12:23,144
without compromising data integrity.

194
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:25,844
Let's look at customization
needs challenge.

195
00:12:25,924 --> 00:12:29,834
Every organization has specific workflows
and business requirements that standard

196
00:12:29,864 --> 00:12:31,794
SAP functionalities may not fully address.

197
00:12:32,074 --> 00:12:36,134
Over customization can lead to
higher cost, system instability,

198
00:12:36,234 --> 00:12:37,804
and challenges in future upgrades.

199
00:12:38,154 --> 00:12:43,254
The mitigation strategies here, instead
of deep customization, SAP recommends a

200
00:12:43,254 --> 00:12:46,584
modular extension approach using SAP BTP.

201
00:12:46,954 --> 00:12:50,884
This method provides customization
solution without altering the core

202
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:55,964
system, reduces the customization
cost by 35%, ensures future

203
00:12:55,974 --> 00:12:57,904
scalable and system stability.

204
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:02,469
By utilizing the SAP BTP businesses
can extend functionality without

205
00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:06,129
compromising upgradability,
ensuring a future proof system.

206
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:08,529
Let's look at change management challenge.

207
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,299
Adopting SAP Cloud means new process, new
workflows, and user adaptation challenges.

208
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:16,289
Resistance to change
can hinder adaptation.

209
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,219
reduce efficiency and impact
ROI mitigation strategy to

210
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:22,939
drive seamless user adaptation.

211
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:26,859
SAP recommends structured change
management initiatives, including

212
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:30,559
role specific training programs,
digital adaptation platforms with

213
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,209
interactive guidance, continuous
user support to address concerns.

214
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:38,339
This approach has proven to achieve
90 percent user proficiency,

215
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,869
reduce support tickets.

216
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:46,584
By focusing on proactive training and
support, organizations can accelerate

217
00:13:46,864 --> 00:13:50,984
adoption, enhance productivity,
and maximize SAP cloud value.

218
00:13:51,484 --> 00:13:54,804
Let's discuss future directions
in SAP Cloud Computing.

219
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:56,744
AI and machine learning expansion.

220
00:13:56,954 --> 00:14:01,064
SAP's enhanced AI capabilities will
integrate advanced language models.

221
00:14:01,444 --> 00:14:04,574
and learning algorithms directly
into core business processes.

222
00:14:04,904 --> 00:14:09,704
Companies can expect 40 percent faster
data analysis, 60 percent more accurate

223
00:14:09,894 --> 00:14:14,124
demand forecasting, and automated
workflows that reduce manual tasks

224
00:14:14,274 --> 00:14:20,474
by up to 70%, fundamentally changing
how teams work and make decisions.

225
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:22,959
Sustainable and Green Cloud.

226
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:28,099
SAP's Green Cloud initiative targets
100 percent renewable energy usage

227
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:33,319
by 2025 and 80 percent reduction
in data centers energy consumption

228
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:35,149
through AI optimized operations.

229
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:39,519
The platform will provide real time
carbon footprint tracking, automated

230
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:44,049
sustainability reporting, and actionable
recommendations that have helped early

231
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,449
adopters reduce their cloud related
emissions by an average of 45%.

232
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:50,169
Let's look at IoT and edge computing.

00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:54,369
Next generation IoT integration will
bring computing power closer to the data

234
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:57,589
source, reducing latency by up to 90%.

235
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:03,159
Manufacturing plants can process sensor
data locally, enabling real time quality

236
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:09,129
control and predictive maintenance, while
retail locations can instantly analyze

237
00:15:09,229 --> 00:15:12,729
customer behavior and inventory levels
without relying on central servers.

238
00:15:13,229 --> 00:15:15,719
Let's look at hyper personalization.

239
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:20,109
