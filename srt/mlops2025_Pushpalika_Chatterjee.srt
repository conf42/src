00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,219
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:04,959
I'm I senior software engineer
manager in payments, and also

3
00:00:04,959 --> 00:00:06,309
an independent AI searcher.

4
00:00:07,284 --> 00:00:11,049
Over the past several years, I have
worked extensively in the financial

5
00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:15,130
services domain, leading the design
modernization of cloud native system,

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:20,019
realtime transaction platform, and
AI driven risk management solutions.

7
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:25,349
Today I will share how generative
AI is reshaping financial services.

8
00:00:25,994 --> 00:00:30,044
Transforming raw transactions into
personalized financial journeys

9
00:00:30,104 --> 00:00:31,755
and intelligent decision making.

10
00:00:32,254 --> 00:00:36,425
I will go to the, go to my first
slide, which is our agenda.

11
00:00:37,144 --> 00:00:42,194
So we are going to introduce what
generative BI is and how it matters

12
00:00:42,194 --> 00:00:47,724
and FinTech, and then we will
eventually follow the evalu evaluation

13
00:00:47,754 --> 00:00:50,334
of gender financial services and ai.

14
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:55,449
And then generative AI in action,
like narrative personalization

15
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:59,410
risk, then we will address the
challenges and consideration.

16
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:04,375
And then we will move to how do we
overcome those kind of challenges?

17
00:01:04,615 --> 00:01:06,385
And then what is the future?

18
00:01:06,415 --> 00:01:11,065
How do we utilize it to show the
generic pi future in the finances

19
00:01:11,215 --> 00:01:16,505
and then statistical case study
and then take hours and conclusion.

20
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:19,450
With that, I will start
with my first slide.

21
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,395
So finance is a data-driven industry,
so for decades, banks have collected

22
00:01:24,395 --> 00:01:29,045
structured ledges and transactions,
but until now, those transactions

23
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:31,385
were treated as an isolated event.

24
00:01:32,285 --> 00:01:37,685
Generative AI changes that it can
combine structured and unstructured

25
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:41,735
data, like spending history of strict
transaction and even voice data

26
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:44,555
into dynamic contextual insight.

27
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,370
For example, instead of just
recording that I spent $50 at

28
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:56,480
Starbucks generative AI can possibly
mention that it has, spending $50

29
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:02,330
at Starbucks has given 18% right to
rise to my expenditure, minimizing

30
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,250
certain percentage of my savings.

31
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,780
So basically it is a fundamental
shift from transaction to

32
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,010
financial storytelling.

33
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:13,635
So how the evaluation of
AI happened in finance.

34
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:15,005
So it's not new.

35
00:02:15,255 --> 00:02:19,575
It has been there with the
finance industry from 1990, but

36
00:02:20,055 --> 00:02:22,965
obviously at a different scale,
completely at a different scale.

37
00:02:23,565 --> 00:02:29,105
So in 1990 to 2000 if you see the
fraud alert credit scoring, that these

38
00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:34,835
are already part of the financial
industries and that is also some

39
00:02:34,835 --> 00:02:39,295
kind of rule-based system integration
adding a lot of value to it.

40
00:02:39,795 --> 00:02:43,090
It is very rigid, but it has a
lot of false positive outlook.

41
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,550
In 2010, machine learning improved
personalization and risk scoring

42
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,100
better, but still predictive.

43
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,950
In late 2010, deep learning
brought a realtime fraud

44
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,290
detection and LP power chatbot.

45
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,295
This is a serious style banking.

46
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:07,815
So in 2020, genetic ai, it's not just
detecting or predicting the fraud, or

47
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:13,045
it is also creating the new output,
like genetic rewards simulating risks,

48
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:16,165
producing personalized recommendations.

49
00:03:16,675 --> 00:03:21,895
So in short, it is not only about
setting the problem, but also proposing

50
00:03:21,895 --> 00:03:24,535
a solution of how do we minimize it.

51
00:03:25,035 --> 00:03:25,545
So let's see.

52
00:03:25,545 --> 00:03:27,885
What is generative AI in finance industry?

53
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:32,465
It's not just doesn't classify
your credit, it creates

54
00:03:32,465 --> 00:03:33,635
the insight and actions.

55
00:03:33,635 --> 00:03:37,865
Like I just quickly, you briefly
mentioned in my previous slide, it

56
00:03:37,865 --> 00:03:41,720
can write personalized financial
reports directly from broadband data.

57
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,080
It can similar crisis in annual.

58
00:03:45,035 --> 00:03:47,135
Somewhat of what if things, right?

59
00:03:47,255 --> 00:03:51,215
So what if the employment is gets
a spike and interest rate double.

60
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:55,225
It can also propose a custom
loan and investment products

61
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,025
tuned to a customer profile.

62
00:03:57,835 --> 00:04:02,605
This means finance shifts from what
happens to what should we do next.

63
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:06,925
Like I mentioned in my previous
slide, as it's not only predict

64
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:10,885
service, but also proposes a
solution of how do we handle that.

65
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:11,955
Moving on.

66
00:04:12,455 --> 00:04:14,195
So transactions to narratives.

67
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:16,110
So what is narratives?

68
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:21,695
So narratives is as simple what
explanation of what just happened,

69
00:04:22,415 --> 00:04:26,890
especially especially for the younger
generation who doesn't, who never tries

70
00:04:27,075 --> 00:04:28,650
to look at the statement, but probably.

71
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:33,455
If you just tell them that your
expenditure has been increased or

72
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:37,385
this is how you save more, probably
that is something would be very easy

73
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:39,365
and quick to grab their attention.

74
00:04:39,865 --> 00:04:43,495
So every customer leaves
behind a financial data trail

75
00:04:44,275 --> 00:04:46,225
pending saving, investing.

76
00:04:46,315 --> 00:04:49,280
So generative AI teaches
those into storage.

77
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,375
So instead of statistic or
static dashboard you are going

78
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,905
to get contextual narrative.

79
00:04:56,405 --> 00:05:00,815
For example, the first slide or the second
slide I just mentioned that spending

80
00:05:00,815 --> 00:05:07,465
$50 at Starbucks means that 18% higher
expenditure affecting my savings this

81
00:05:07,465 --> 00:05:12,280
month, or based on my investment history,
I might miss out some of the tax saving.

82
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,400
So this is something is a storytelling
function, so it catches more people,

83
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:23,070
it catches attention, and also from the
layman user, like the consumers who are

84
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:28,770
actually using the finals but not into
the financial industry, it is very easy

85
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,720
to grab their attention and help them.

86
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,475
So personalization.

87
00:05:33,195 --> 00:05:36,085
Traditional banking is one size fits all.

88
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:40,255
So they have the limited four, five
categories of the products, and we

89
00:05:40,255 --> 00:05:45,955
just have to customize our need to make
sure which product fits with generative

90
00:05:46,015 --> 00:05:51,345
ai, enable sales to conventional
assistant that answers plain language,

91
00:05:51,915 --> 00:05:56,170
dynamic loan offers interested,
tailored to our realtime profiles.

92
00:05:57,075 --> 00:06:01,095
Adaptive investment advice that
address when market shipped.

93
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:06,375
Our major European bank reported
that AI powered personalization

94
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:10,155
increased cross sell conversion by 35%.

95
00:06:10,655 --> 00:06:14,555
So obviously for individual,
instead of using those five, six

96
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:19,715
predefined categories, it helps
to tailor loan and the percentage

97
00:06:19,775 --> 00:06:21,965
and the usage for everything.

98
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:26,555
So for example, that we have a home
mortgage loan of 500 k generating

99
00:06:26,555 --> 00:06:29,595
an EMI of 30 three K every month.

100
00:06:29,895 --> 00:06:32,055
And that is supposed
to be paid in 20 years.

101
00:06:32,595 --> 00:06:34,935
So what if you pay a thousand
dollars per month extra?

102
00:06:35,235 --> 00:06:37,145
What if you pay a hundred k extra?

103
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:43,080
So what is the duration of the loan that
reduces to what is the EMI that reduces

104
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,230
to, those are the kind of personalization
that is very easy to opt in through this

105
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:54,000
generative ai and give an answer to the
tailored answer to the speak consumer.

106
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,380
Last, but last, but not the list.

107
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,095
Free scan fraud intelligence.

108
00:06:58,595 --> 00:07:00,030
On the different side, fraud.

109
00:07:00,335 --> 00:07:02,555
Fraud are using ai, right?

110
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:08,015
So there are so many fraudulent activity
that is trying to attack our system,

111
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:12,475
and they are all using ai opting for
the smartest way to hack a system.

112
00:07:12,985 --> 00:07:17,575
So if we use the generative
ai, we can defense at the same

113
00:07:17,575 --> 00:07:20,690
scale that we are being hacked
or at least trying to be hacked.

114
00:07:21,595 --> 00:07:26,065
So generative AI helps to create
synthetic fraud patterns, to

115
00:07:26,215 --> 00:07:32,615
train models that are more robust,
similar adversial attacks, like fake

116
00:07:32,615 --> 00:07:34,265
transaction even before they happen.

117
00:07:34,835 --> 00:07:38,045
It builds stress for
liquidity and credit crisis.

118
00:07:38,915 --> 00:07:44,075
This moves banks from being reactive
to a proactive guardian, and we can

119
00:07:44,075 --> 00:07:45,995
just think of it as a digital vaccine.

120
00:07:46,495 --> 00:07:51,095
Instead of the time we are hacked,
how to try to get out of it, making

121
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,505
sure our system doesn't fail.

122
00:07:52,985 --> 00:07:57,095
We are developing tests in, or
test suit in such a way that

123
00:07:57,425 --> 00:07:59,255
we are actually isolating the.

124
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,650
One in a million kind of
possibilities and the age cases.

125
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:09,840
And we are actually and proactively
testing our system against those

126
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,250
kind of attacks, making our system
more prepared to handle those kind

127
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,570
of AI generated attacks, which are
more vulnerable than any other, any

128
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,495
of the previous that used to happen.

129
00:08:20,995 --> 00:08:25,720
Yeah, but nothing is free of course,
obviously any big innovation comes with

130
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,445
a bigger responsibility and definitely
Generative BI is not free of that.

131
00:08:30,505 --> 00:08:33,895
It definitely has some challenges
and consideration to address.

132
00:08:34,395 --> 00:08:38,415
So bias, obviously there are people
who are financially privileged,

133
00:08:38,415 --> 00:08:41,475
there are consumers who are not
that financially privileged.

134
00:08:42,015 --> 00:08:47,505
So we definitely, while using the ai,
we must take into consideration that

135
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:52,095
it should not be the case that we are
implementing security in such a way that

136
00:08:52,425 --> 00:08:58,485
those who are more financially stable are
getting to those security versus those

137
00:08:58,485 --> 00:09:00,405
who are not that financially stable.

138
00:09:00,855 --> 00:09:01,065
If.

139
00:09:01,405 --> 00:09:03,085
Getting reprint from ING there.

140
00:09:03,535 --> 00:09:08,125
So we just have to maintain a balance
and kind of implement in such a way that

141
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:13,910
cost should not be a bias at the consumer
level, making those kind of facilities

142
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,885
available to all level of consumer.

143
00:09:16,385 --> 00:09:21,145
Privacy banking data is amongst
the most sensitive data.

144
00:09:21,445 --> 00:09:23,785
And it has to go through so many laws.

145
00:09:23,845 --> 00:09:28,705
It has G-D-P-R-C-C-P-A, so we
just need to make sure that we

146
00:09:28,705 --> 00:09:30,385
comply with those kind of laws.

147
00:09:30,415 --> 00:09:36,175
Otherwise miss you utilizing of those
kind of PIs can cause bank a lot of mail.

148
00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:42,640
Explainability regulators won't accept
this bag box answer like modern LLS.

149
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,000
Most of the times we just keep
command and things get executed.

150
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,920
So we do have to deal with all
the regulations at the bank admin

151
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,950
level, and we need to make sure
that we have answers to any kind of

152
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,990
justification on any kind of output.

153
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,900
Security model sensor can be attacked,
obviously because that's a system.

154
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,720
There like we used to have in old
time R-D-B-M-S, we used to have

155
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,690
the SQL injection, so like that
we can have a prompt injection.

156
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,920
So we need to make our models
prepared for all this kind of setup.

157
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,920
So success is not about just the accuracy,
but it's also about trust and fairness.

158
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:25,420
So it is not an impossible to
overcome those kind of challenges,

159
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,460
but while designing our system, we
definitely have to make sure that we

160
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,590
take all of this into consideration.

161
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,800
So privacy preserving generative ai.

162
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:39,160
So obviously with that this is
also again, a part of the risk and

163
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,780
especially with the banking data.

164
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:43,795
There are lot of security issues.

165
00:10:43,795 --> 00:10:45,655
There are a lot of privacy related issues.

166
00:10:45,655 --> 00:10:46,675
So how do we do that?

167
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:51,705
We have to implement the federated
learning so we can have, we

168
00:10:51,705 --> 00:10:54,525
can let the bank collaborate
without sharing the raw data.

169
00:10:55,065 --> 00:10:58,965
So we can definitely think through
that direction to protect the privacy.

170
00:10:58,965 --> 00:11:00,345
At the same time, use such a net.

171
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:05,495
B, we can use differential
privacy privacy that ensures

172
00:11:05,555 --> 00:11:07,715
output can't expose individuals.

173
00:11:08,215 --> 00:11:09,175
Explainable ai.

174
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:13,475
So this kind of the, in the previous
slide, this is one of the challenges

175
00:11:13,475 --> 00:11:18,015
that we need explanation for the
regulatory and compliance things.

176
00:11:18,015 --> 00:11:19,755
We cannot accept the black box answers.

177
00:11:19,755 --> 00:11:25,125
So to do that, there is explainable
ai xai that helps regulators and users

178
00:11:25,395 --> 00:11:29,480
understand the decision that this is
what happened, this is what is rejected,

179
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,600
why this has happened or rejected.

180
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:36,265
Without exposing the direct
rules, but also harm some user

181
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:39,415
understand format of the rules.

182
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:43,115
So when these are combined we
would definitely get systems that

183
00:11:43,115 --> 00:11:47,285
are not only powerful, but also
ethical and reor regulatory ready.

184
00:11:47,785 --> 00:11:51,330
So how do we use it in future
like autonomous finance?

185
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,320
Let's imagine where this
technology is heading.

186
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:58,820
We are on the path towards autonomous
finance, but many financial DI

187
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:02,720
decisions are optimized in real
time by intelligent systems.

188
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,510
So here are now three emerging directions
that our finance industry is heading to.

189
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,120
So multi-agent AI systems.

190
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:15,400
So instead of using a single model making
decisions, there are specialized agent

191
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,461
work together, farming and agent TKI.

192
00:12:18,985 --> 00:12:23,465
This Azure system that has one agent
for risk, another for liquidity, another

193
00:12:23,465 --> 00:12:28,475
for compliance, and they can negotiate
balance, trade off, self optimize.

194
00:12:29,105 --> 00:12:33,335
For example, a risk agent might
signal an alert and liquidity

195
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:37,145
agent might automatically relocate
funds to mental stability.

196
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:39,280
So that is fully automated, right?

197
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,040
Without any kind of manual intervention.

198
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,390
So personal finance
copilot, so just as many as.

199
00:12:46,915 --> 00:12:51,715
As many of us uses the GPS today for
any kind of navigation system, even

200
00:12:51,715 --> 00:12:56,485
for searching a gas station, the
same way we can have an AI copilot

201
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,305
to for balancing our finances.

202
00:12:59,025 --> 00:13:02,455
For example, the it can remind us
for the bill pay, it can remind

203
00:13:02,455 --> 00:13:03,715
us of the credit card payment.

204
00:13:03,725 --> 00:13:07,145
It can schedule the payment
for us in a more advanced way.

205
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,020
There is some account that
is running out of balance.

206
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:14,730
It can transfer funds between that
so it can actually start or manage

207
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,920
the finals in an autopilot mode.

208
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:22,180
From optimizing our monthly savings
to choosing the, choosing the

209
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,170
right tax advantage investment
to automatically adjusting the

210
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,270
portfolio to as the market shift.

211
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:33,595
And the third and the biggest one is
the large scale financial and simulation

212
00:13:34,225 --> 00:13:38,635
regulators and central banks could
be AI driven simulations of entire

213
00:13:38,635 --> 00:13:40,765
economics to credit systematic risk.

214
00:13:41,215 --> 00:13:45,955
Imagine being able to stress test,
I release of a new currency, like

215
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:50,010
a digital dollar or a euro of
hundreds of scenario before launch.

216
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:55,910
So this is finance that is resilient
and in process, but again, success

217
00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:00,535
depends on embedding fairness, privacy,
and transparency on every stage.

218
00:14:01,035 --> 00:14:05,830
Moving on to bring this down
from vision to practice, let

219
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,055
me share a concrete case study.

220
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,680
Personalized wealth management
assistant, we piloted.

221
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,280
So we will have an input
process and output.

222
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:20,800
So from the input perspective, it we will,
it would be a system ingested customers,

223
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,870
real world data spending, pattern setting
behavior and investment preferences.

224
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,850
So what do we process in it?

225
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,575
It would be, it would
use the generative bi.

226
00:14:31,075 --> 00:14:35,215
It'll create the customized report
projections and even what if scenarios.

227
00:14:35,425 --> 00:14:41,605
For example, if we increase monthly
savings by 5% maybe we will reach our

228
00:14:41,605 --> 00:14:43,105
retirement three years already again.

229
00:14:43,615 --> 00:14:45,445
So what do we do?

230
00:14:45,445 --> 00:14:47,515
What is our goal and what
do we do to achieve that?

231
00:14:48,015 --> 00:14:52,090
Personalized proposals for
a solutions and output.

232
00:14:52,615 --> 00:14:55,105
Generated tax optimization strategies.

233
00:14:55,255 --> 00:14:59,955
For example that we should have there
was a tax investment scheme, like we

234
00:14:59,955 --> 00:15:02,895
should have invested in four one K more.

235
00:15:03,255 --> 00:15:03,825
We haven't.

236
00:15:04,215 --> 00:15:08,665
So that kind of ended up with this
much of tax tax credit, which we could

237
00:15:08,665 --> 00:15:13,255
have easily avoided by using this, and
we can probably plan that next year.

238
00:15:13,755 --> 00:15:19,115
So what do we input, based on our
real time data, the process is the

239
00:15:19,115 --> 00:15:21,785
what type analysis and output is.

240
00:15:21,785 --> 00:15:25,130
What do we actually do to
avoid what we didn't the same.

241
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,160
So the results were remarkable.

242
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,140
The customer's engagement
increased by 40%.

243
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,820
The financial literacy score improved
significantly because the customer finally

244
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:39,530
understood the money in plain language,
which I say that from non-financial

245
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:43,610
consumers payments were, it is, it
was never more than just a number.

246
00:15:44,255 --> 00:15:47,855
Just the numbers and some balance,
but they never used to understand

247
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:53,135
finance by looking at it statement
over last 30 days or 60 days.

248
00:15:53,525 --> 00:15:58,545
It is probably just random numbers for
them, but with this generative AI and

249
00:15:58,545 --> 00:16:04,255
simplified language and the storytelling,
like financial storytelling, that helps

250
00:16:04,405 --> 00:16:09,535
the name and consumer to understand the
financial language and plan accordingly.

251
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,820
So this demonstrate that the generic
PPI isn't just password, it can

252
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,870
drive business KPI's, customer
satisfaction and regulatory alignment.

253
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,505
Moving on key takeaways.

254
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:24,635
So as we, there are four messages
that I would like to carry forward.

255
00:16:25,145 --> 00:16:29,005
Generative AI is moving finance
from data to experience.

256
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:31,855
We are no longer limited
to raw transactions.

257
00:16:31,945 --> 00:16:34,765
We are building personalized
financial journeys.

258
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:41,155
It enables both customer value and
institutional resilience on the front end.

259
00:16:41,245 --> 00:16:43,525
The hyper-personalization
improves engagement.

260
00:16:44,365 --> 00:16:48,865
On the backend, the synthetic fraud
scenarios and stress, strength, and

261
00:16:48,865 --> 00:16:52,215
defenses responsible AI is non-negotiable.

262
00:16:52,725 --> 00:16:57,390
Privacy, fairness and explainability are
the nice they're not just nice to have.

263
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,360
They're regulatory, ethical,
and strategic requirement.

264
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,300
The future is autonomous finals.

265
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:09,480
Multi-agent system, personal finance,
co-pilot global financial simulations

266
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,580
will transform not just the banks,
but also society, not also how

267
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,620
society interacts with the money.

268
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:22,145
If I had to summarize the winner, sub next
ticket in finance will be those who can

269
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:24,140
balance innovation with responsibility.

270
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,510
So with this note, I just would
like to conclude my presentation.

271
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:34,420
So generality, BI is not just transforming
finances, it is humanizing it, turning

272
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,190
core transaction into meaningful journey.

273
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,120
Thank you.
