1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,580
Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:07,399
it's a pleasure to be here today to
discuss an exciting and transformative

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,830
topic, the growth and potential
of the Internet of Things or IOT.

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:18,850
IOT is shaping industries, creating
new opportunities and fundamentally

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:23,414
changing how we interact with
technology in our daily lives.

6
00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:28,534
But as promising as IOT is,
It's growth is far from simple.

7
00:00:29,034 --> 00:00:35,114
Today, I'll walk you through the
opportunities, challenges, and

8
00:00:35,124 --> 00:00:38,654
strategies that define the IOT landscape.

9
00:00:39,154 --> 00:00:42,364
We'll explore the
importance of user insights.

10
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:44,599
personalization, and collaboration.

11
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:50,319
And I'll share examples that show how IOT
companies are creating meaningful value.

12
00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:53,289
Let's begin by looking at the big picture.

13
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,379
So why IOT growth is complex?

14
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,129
The IOT market.

15
00:00:59,534 --> 00:01:01,104
is expanding rapidly.

16
00:01:01,164 --> 00:01:06,244
By 2030, it's expected to connect 24.

17
00:01:06,245 --> 00:01:08,534
1 billion devices and generate 1.

18
00:01:08,534 --> 00:01:12,104
5 trillion dollars in revenue.

19
00:01:12,424 --> 00:01:16,234
This growth is impressive,
but it also fragmented.

20
00:01:16,804 --> 00:01:20,814
Devices are used in diverse
sectors like media, smart grids,

21
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,934
connected vehicles, and lightning.

22
00:01:23,454 --> 00:01:27,174
Each sector has unique
requirements, making scalability

23
00:01:27,214 --> 00:01:29,064
and integration complex.

24
00:01:29,604 --> 00:01:35,774
Additionally, consumer applications
dominate revenue, but industry Like

25
00:01:35,774 --> 00:01:38,484
healthcare or else is significant.

26
00:01:38,734 --> 00:01:43,734
Interestingly, that 66 percent of IOT
revenue comes from services, but not

27
00:01:43,744 --> 00:01:49,354
hardware showing the need for ongoing
customer engagement, geographically,

28
00:01:49,364 --> 00:01:55,904
China, North America, and Europe lead the
way each with union, unique challenges

29
00:01:56,394 --> 00:02:02,014
like compliance and localization
to navigate these complexities.

30
00:02:02,054 --> 00:02:04,784
Companies must focus on more than numbers.

31
00:02:04,964 --> 00:02:11,134
They must deeply understand user
needs and create long term value.

32
00:02:11,634 --> 00:02:15,544
So what does this focus
on user needs mean?

33
00:02:15,954 --> 00:02:21,904
Success in IOT comes from balancing user
needs, data analytics, and innovation.

34
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:27,704
First, products must solve real problems,
whether it's ensuring security at home

35
00:02:27,754 --> 00:02:29,664
or streamlining business operations.

36
00:02:30,044 --> 00:02:34,064
Second, IOT devices generate
massive amounts of behavioral

37
00:02:34,074 --> 00:02:38,559
data which can uncover unmet
needs and market opportunities.

38
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:44,949
And third, these data drives hyper
personalized solutions, enabling companies

39
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,559
to stand out in competitive markets.

40
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:55,379
In essence, IOT breaches the gap between
data collection and actionable insights,

41
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,869
allowing companies to adapt quickly.

42
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,904
to changing user behaviors.

43
00:03:00,494 --> 00:03:05,244
Personalization doesn't just improve
customer satisfaction, it creates loyalty.

44
00:03:05,744 --> 00:03:09,584
So start with the target audience, really.

45
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:14,724
Let's dive deeper into
understanding your audience.

46
00:03:15,024 --> 00:03:17,824
IoT users fall into three key groups.

47
00:03:17,854 --> 00:03:22,844
Of course, first of all, families who
want simplicity and safety like smart home

48
00:03:22,844 --> 00:03:26,024
devices, for example, for energy savings.

49
00:03:26,614 --> 00:03:27,544
Of course, businesses.

50
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,419
which prioritizes efficiency and
scalability through industrial IOT

51
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:38,479
solution and industries such as
health care, for example, focusing on

52
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:41,369
innovation and workflow integration.

53
00:03:42,059 --> 00:03:48,079
By addressing these groups specific
pain points, IOT products can increase

54
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:50,229
user satisfaction and retention.

55
00:03:50,649 --> 00:03:56,999
This approach not only builds trust, but
also improves return on investment by

56
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:59,949
allying solutions with real world needs.

57
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:07,039
So in this context, of course, behavioral
insights should be a gold mine.

58
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:12,179
Understanding behavior is a
game changer for IOT companies.

59
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:14,979
IOT devices generate detailed insights.

60
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:19,014
like usage patterns and preferences
which can guide innovation.

61
00:04:19,304 --> 00:04:24,154
For example, Smart thermostat
might reveal when user adjusts

62
00:04:24,154 --> 00:04:30,364
temperature, enabling the creation of
productive features that save energy.

63
00:04:30,724 --> 00:04:37,459
Behavioral data also help refine
existing products or Inspired new ones.

64
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:45,189
With IOT adoption expected to exceed
100 billion devices by 2050, staying

65
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:47,659
ahead of evolving demands is critical.

66
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:53,339
Insights ensure that businesses
stay competitive and deliver

67
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:55,839
hyper personalized experiences.

68
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:58,959
This brings us to micro targeting.

69
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:03,599
IOT's superpower for
personalizing user experience.

70
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:06,089
Think of iot user as a pyramid.

71
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:13,649
General users want basic functionality
like a smart home system with easy setup.

72
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:19,819
Segmented groups such as energy
conclusions user benefit from tailored

73
00:05:19,859 --> 00:05:24,069
energy saving features and micro
segments like frequent travelers.

74
00:05:24,994 --> 00:05:28,834
Needs specialized options
like remote device management.

75
00:05:29,714 --> 00:05:34,844
A thermostat company, for example,
could solve general users with basic

76
00:05:34,844 --> 00:05:40,904
features while offering AI drive and
energy saving tools to niche segment

77
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:47,564
personalization builds satisfaction
and retention across all user levels.

78
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:52,984
Let's shift gears to another
critical aspect, turning

79
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:54,569
problems into opportunities.

80
00:05:55,504 --> 00:05:56,934
It's a real great one.

81
00:05:57,454 --> 00:06:01,884
Every frustration users face
is a chance to innovate, is a

82
00:06:01,884 --> 00:06:03,754
chance to create something new.

83
00:06:04,204 --> 00:06:11,004
Listening to complaints helps uncover
gaps and guides impactful solution.

84
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,434
Case study.

85
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:17,694
For example, Nest, Tramastat,
Nest users often found manual

86
00:06:17,734 --> 00:06:19,914
temperature adjustment tedious.

87
00:06:20,624 --> 00:06:27,234
So Nest introduced auto schedule, which
allows user to Preferences and adjust

88
00:06:27,294 --> 00:06:33,734
automatically the result, a seamless
experience and around 12 percent savings

89
00:06:33,754 --> 00:06:36,924
on heating costs by solving pain points.

90
00:06:37,124 --> 00:06:40,944
Nest didn't just fix a problem,
it create lasting of value.

91
00:06:41,804 --> 00:06:47,094
So to create such impactful products,
engaging with your community is essential.

92
00:06:47,484 --> 00:06:51,704
Users aren't just customers,
they are your co creators.

93
00:06:52,234 --> 00:06:55,414
Regular service, beta testing, forums.

94
00:06:55,435 --> 00:07:01,634
allow companies to listen and
involve users in shaping solution.

95
00:07:02,134 --> 00:07:05,964
For example, when users contribute
ideas or test prototypes, they

96
00:07:05,964 --> 00:07:08,664
feel valued, which builds loyalty.

97
00:07:08,934 --> 00:07:14,544
Community collaboration often leads
to fresh, user centered innovations

98
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:17,464
that drive continuous improvement.

99
00:07:17,964 --> 00:07:21,914
The innovation process begins with data.

100
00:07:22,084 --> 00:07:27,564
First, collect user interactions and
identify patterns, then translate

101
00:07:27,604 --> 00:07:32,004
these raw data into insights
that highlight opportunities.

102
00:07:32,044 --> 00:07:36,444
Next, align ideas with these
insights to brainstorm solutions,

103
00:07:36,484 --> 00:07:41,754
and finally, test prototypes with
user and inter aid based on feedback.

104
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:47,064
This build test learn loop ensures
IoT products involve in the line

105
00:07:47,094 --> 00:07:48,454
with users demands and needs.

106
00:07:48,464 --> 00:07:50,974
Stay relevant in dynamic markets.

107
00:07:51,474 --> 00:07:57,924
So I also told about, the behavior
driving innovation from the nest

108
00:07:57,934 --> 00:08:03,874
thermostat, really the result and
the savings, Around 12 percent of

109
00:08:03,904 --> 00:08:07,084
heating cost is a great result.

110
00:08:07,544 --> 00:08:12,954
Behavioral insights allow companies
like Nest to anticipate needs

111
00:08:13,044 --> 00:08:15,274
and deliver meaningful solution.

112
00:08:15,774 --> 00:08:19,104
how do we get from
ideas to market success?

113
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:21,049
Prototyping is a key.

114
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:28,779
Of course, so we should start with a MVP
that address one core problem, just one.

115
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:35,079
Then test it with real users, gather
feedback, and refine based on insights.

116
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:41,829
This agile approach reduces risk and
ensures solutions align with market needs.

117
00:08:42,329 --> 00:08:45,039
IOT isn't limited to a single market.

118
00:08:45,154 --> 00:08:51,304
It creates opportunity in medicine,
agriculture, energy, automotive

119
00:08:51,814 --> 00:08:56,149
industries, and Lots of different others.

120
00:08:56,739 --> 00:09:02,559
For example, Medtronic uses IOD to enable
insulin pumps to improve patient outcomes.

121
00:09:03,249 --> 00:09:08,119
