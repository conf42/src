00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:02,002
As AI technologies continues to scale
globally, data Sovety has emerged

173
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:07,160
as one of the most significant
non-technical challenges, regulations

174
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:14,235
around data privacy and cross border
transfer data complexities that require

175
00:14:14,345 --> 00:14:20,720
careful ion to ensure compliance and
mitigate risks coming to the cross

176
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,550
border data transfer restrictions.

177
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:27,410
Let's talk about this cross
border data transfer restrictions,

178
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,050
different jurisdictions.

179
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:35,840
How, where very varying rules
regarding how and where data can be

180
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,630
stored, processed, and transferred.

181
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:44,930
For example, the European Unions,
GDPR, mandates that personal data must

182
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:50,030
not to be transferred outside the US
unless certain conditions are met.

183
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,580
Creating hurdles of global AI
deployment strategies, the complexity

184
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:00,680
of these regulations across countries
can make it difficult for companies

185
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,740
to build consistent globally.

186
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:10,850
AI models that require large scale
cross border data exchange, GDPR,

187
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:17,245
and similar regulation frameworks,
regulations such as GDPR impose strength.

188
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:24,350
Requirements on how data is handled,
including the need to ensure data

189
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:30,590
is processed securely, has the
appropriate consent, and is stored

190
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,650
within specific geographical boundaries.

191
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,510
Non-compliance with these regulations
can result in hefty fines,

192
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,940
millions of dollars in penalties.

193
00:15:41,285 --> 00:15:47,765
That pose serious financial and
reputational risks to organization using

194
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:54,005
centralized cloud-based data processing
architectures coming to the governance

195
00:15:54,515 --> 00:16:00,485
consistency with the distribution of
edge computing across various locations.

196
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:05,795
Maintaining consistent governance
and security policies become

197
00:16:05,945 --> 00:16:06,965
increasingly challenging.

198
00:16:07,685 --> 00:16:12,665
Ensuring compliance at each edge,
node, or deployment point, which

199
00:16:12,665 --> 00:16:18,425
could span several countries or
even continents, requires a robust

200
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:24,995
framework to enforce uniform policies
and maintaining data integrity data.

201
00:16:24,995 --> 00:16:30,095
Ty challenges are increasingly
complex in a globalized world,

202
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,830
especially for AI driven solutions.

203
00:16:33,485 --> 00:16:38,225
While Edge Computing offers a
potential solution by keeping data

204
00:16:38,225 --> 00:16:44,405
within its jurisdiction of origin,
it introduces new challenges in

205
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:50,070
maintaining consistent governance
across distributed edge environments.

206
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:55,050
Developing a robust governance
model that balance data severity,

207
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,090
compliance, and security across all
edge node is critical for successful.

208
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,790
Scalable AI developments.

209
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:11,639
Coming to the next slide, severe
security in distributed edge, AI

210
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:14,670
edge deployment, grow and evolve.

211
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:18,329
Securing distributed system
become a top priority.

212
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,130
The expanded attack surface in
distributed environments calls for

213
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:29,400
rethink in traditional security
models, focusing on defense in depth.

214
00:17:29,985 --> 00:17:34,514
Strategies and zero trust
approach to safeguard data and

215
00:17:34,784 --> 00:17:36,855
workloads across edge nodes.

216
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:42,105
Let's talk about zero trust
architecture, quantum resistant

217
00:17:42,105 --> 00:17:47,385
encryption, continuous vulnerability
scanning, secure AR hardware enclaves.

218
00:17:47,745 --> 00:17:54,075
Coming to the zero trust architecture,
zero trust architecture, assume

219
00:17:54,075 --> 00:17:58,125
that threats can exist both
inside and outside the network.

220
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:02,475
Requiring identity verification
for every system interaction.

221
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:09,795
Whether it's a user, device or service,
this never trust, always verify ensures

222
00:18:09,795 --> 00:18:14,625
that only authenticated users and
systems can interact with since two

223
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:21,435
data and applications, minimize the
risk of unauthorized access coming

224
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:23,580
to the quantum resistant encryption.

225
00:18:23,715 --> 00:18:28,725
With the rise of quantum computing
on the horizon, traditional

226
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:33,465
encryption methods may no longer be
sufficient to protect sensitive data.

227
00:18:34,275 --> 00:18:39,705
To prepare for forced quantum threat
landscape, forward thinking, organizations

228
00:18:39,705 --> 00:18:45,195
are already implementing quantum
resistance encryption protocols, which

229
00:18:45,195 --> 00:18:50,895
are designed to secure data against the
future capabilities of quantum computers.

230
00:18:51,435 --> 00:18:56,355
Coming to the continuous vulnerability,

00:18:56,565 --> 00:19:01,005
distributed edge environments
necessary states continuous monitoring

232
00:19:01,034 --> 00:19:03,525
and proactive security measure.

233
00:19:03,825 --> 00:19:09,195
Automated vulnerability scanning helps
detect and remediate security flaws

234
00:19:09,195 --> 00:19:11,625
in real time across all edge nos.

235
00:19:12,405 --> 00:19:16,995
This continuous assessment ensure
that vulnerabilities are addressed

236
00:19:17,235 --> 00:19:18,970
before they can be exploited.

237
00:19:19,815 --> 00:19:23,985
Keeping secure posture up to
date and reducing response

238
00:19:23,985 --> 00:19:26,145
times to potential threats.

239
00:19:26,955 --> 00:19:31,325
Coming to the secure Hardware

240
00:19:31,325 --> 00:19:36,545
environments designed especially for
running since two workloads securely.

241
00:19:37,055 --> 00:19:43,265
These enclaves protect the critical data
by preventing unauthorized access or.

242
00:19:44,135 --> 00:19:50,465
Tampering, even if surrounding system
is compromised, ensuring that high stake

243
00:19:50,465 --> 00:19:56,645
operations like AI model training or
financial transactions remains secure.

244
00:19:57,965 --> 00:20:01,655
Coming to the next slide at
autonomous edge infrastructure,

245
00:20:02,655 --> 00:20:07,305
the operational complexities of managing
distributed edge infrastructure.

246
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:13,080
Especially in remote and geographical
environments are driving the

247
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,630
development of autonomous system.

248
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,730
These systems are designed to
optimize, heal, and defend the edge

249
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:26,790
infrastructure without human intervention,
ensuring continuous, efficient and

250
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:32,430
secure operations, self-optimizing,
dynamic workload balancing and

251
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,430
resource allocation, self-optimizing.

252
00:20:35,805 --> 00:20:40,935
Platforms automatically adjust resource
allocation based on the demands of

253
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:46,935
incoming workloads, ensuring that
computational power is used efficiently.

254
00:20:47,835 --> 00:20:53,415
This dynamic workloads balancing optimizes
performances while simultaneously

255
00:20:53,415 --> 00:20:58,455
minimizing energy consumption,
making edge infrastructure both cost

256
00:20:58,455 --> 00:21:01,335
effective and sustainable as workload.

257
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:06,810
These platforms can scale
resource up or down as needed

258
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,240
without manual intervention.

259
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:15,360
Coming to the self-healing, automatic
fault detection and recovery.

260
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:20,190
Self-healing capabilities are crucial
for ensuring the reliability of

261
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,560
distributed edge system where physical
access to hardware may be limited.

262
00:21:26,295 --> 00:21:31,365
These systems can automatically detect
the hardware or software failures and

263
00:21:31,575 --> 00:21:37,935
quickly initiate recovery procedures such
as a rerouting traffic or reconfiguration

264
00:21:37,935 --> 00:21:39,885
nodes to maintain functionality.

265
00:21:40,635 --> 00:21:41,205
This fall.

266
00:21:41,205 --> 00:21:47,505
Detection and recovery reduces downtime
and help ensure high vis availability

267
00:21:47,505 --> 00:21:52,305
in environments where immediate
hormone intervention is not feasible.

268
00:21:53,085 --> 00:21:54,930
Let's talk about self defending.

269
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,250
Prior to threat mitigation without
human intervention, the most advanced

270
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,720
edge systems now incorporate self
defending mission mechanism to

271
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,060
address security threat in real time.

272
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:14,910
These systems continuously monitor for
anomaly and vulnerabilities within the

273
00:22:14,915 --> 00:22:19,380
Edge network and can proactively take
action to mitigate potential threats.

274
00:22:19,754 --> 00:22:24,495
Such as isolating compromise node
or blocking malicious traffic

275
00:22:24,495 --> 00:22:26,385
without human involvement.

276
00:22:26,985 --> 00:22:32,145
This prior to threat mitigation
ensures that edge environments

277
00:22:32,264 --> 00:22:38,085
remain secure even when operating
in remote unmonitored locations.

278
00:22:39,085 --> 00:22:43,135
Coming to the next slide,
implementation strategy framework.

279
00:22:44,305 --> 00:22:51,055

Let's talk about workload assessment.

287
00:23:17,215 --> 00:23:22,555
The first opinion, any IT deployment is
to thoroughly evaluate the application

288
00:23:22,555 --> 00:23:27,835
characteristics to determine if the edge
is right environment for the workloads.

289
00:23:28,135 --> 00:23:29,665
This includes accessing.

290
00:23:30,205 --> 00:23:34,075
Latency requirements, data
volumes, processing needs.

291
00:23:35,275 --> 00:23:39,985
This assessment help prioritize which
application will benefit the most of

292
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:44,965
the edge computing, ensuring optimal
performance and resource allocation.

293
00:23:45,955 --> 00:23:48,235
Let's talk about
infrastructure deployment.

294
00:23:49,285 --> 00:23:54,115
The next phase is the physical deployment
of edge infrastructure with a focus

295
00:23:54,115 --> 00:23:56,605

and performance security protocol must

303
00:24:33,655 --> 00:24:40,255
be implemented to safeguards, data and
operations across distributed edge notes.

304
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,770
Application migration.

305
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,995
Once the infrastructure is in
place, application needs to be

306
00:24:48,025 --> 00:24:50,050
migrated to the edge environments.

307
00:24:50,575 --> 00:24:56,125
This typically involves refactoring
existing application to make them

308
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,345
compatible with edge environments.

309
00:24:58,855 --> 00:25:03,265

00:25:16,945 --> 00:25:20,965
Ensuring that the application
operates consistently across

314
00:25:20,965 --> 00:25:22,255
different environments.

315
00:25:22,705 --> 00:25:27,475
The use of con containerization
and orchestration also enhances

316
00:25:27,475 --> 00:25:33,175
flexibility and portability,
allowing applications to be moved

317
00:25:33,415 --> 00:25:39,895
between different edge environment
with easy, continuous optimization.

318
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:46,570
Finally, after deployment, it is
essential to continuously monitor

319
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:52,780
performance metrics to ensure that
a GA AI system operates optimally.

320
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,990

00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:08,515
to drive efficiency and innovation.

337
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:15,685
This ing of inte at the edge means
that enterprise will not only process

338
00:27:15,685 --> 00:27:21,505
data closer to its source, but will
also see applications evolve into

339
00:27:21,505 --> 00:27:27,115
self aware systems capable of making
real-time decisions without relaying

340
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,335
on centralized cloud infrastructure.

341
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,800
