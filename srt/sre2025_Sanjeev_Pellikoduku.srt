1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,110
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,019
Come 42 site level to Engineer 25.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,990
Today I'm going to talk about AI
driven cloud solutions, overcoming

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,640
challenges, and ensure ethical deployment
and site liability engineering.

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,230
So the convergence of artificial
intelligence and cloud computing is

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,520
revolutionist industries creating
unprecedented opportunities.

7
00:00:22,195 --> 00:00:27,105
While presenting any challenge for site
engineers, as organizations rush to

8
00:00:27,105 --> 00:00:34,065
harness a potential in cloud environments
size, face complex obstacles in security

9
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:37,215
integration and operational efficiency.

10
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:42,705
So this present, this presentation
explodes the rapidly evolving

11
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:47,540
landscape of AI in cloud computing,
examining the critical challenges

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,380
facing SRE and providing.

13
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:52,895
Data backed solutions to address them.

14
00:00:53,395 --> 00:00:58,285
We'll investigate security concerns,
integration complexities, and

15
00:00:58,285 --> 00:01:02,425
ethical consideration that must
be navigated for successful AI

16
00:01:02,425 --> 00:01:04,495
implementation in cloud systems.

17
00:01:04,995 --> 00:01:08,110
So next, so this is the
growing of AI cloud market.

18
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,355
The current AI cloud market evolution
more than 1.2 billion by two three.

19
00:01:13,855 --> 00:01:21,595
So 30 30 upon 6% the growth rate, 68%
reduction rate, 31% de efficiency gain.

20
00:01:22,095 --> 00:01:27,015
Next, security challenges in AI
cloud integration, especially data

21
00:01:27,015 --> 00:01:32,355
privacy concerns, the model production
security instance, the deficiency

22
00:01:32,855 --> 00:01:37,475
represents the foremost challenge for SR
implementing AI in cloud environments.

23
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,185
Our nation struggle with.

24
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:43,685
Production sensitive training data
while maintaining model accuracy.

25
00:01:44,495 --> 00:01:49,055
Simultaneously, a models stem cell
required production from increasingly

26
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:54,155
sophisticated, a adverse attacks
that attempts to manipulate outputs

27
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,590
or extract convention information.

28
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,050
So coming to security solutions
with implementation of homomorphic

29
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,530
encryption enables computation on
encrypted data without decryption.

30
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,409
Preserves privacy through
or the processing pipeline.

31
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,900
Secure and clear, isolated
execution environments, operations,

32
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,670
hardware level production.

33
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,920
For am model inference with
implement is differential privacy.

34
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,260
Mathematical frameworks
to limit individual data.

35
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,600
Exposure balances data utility
with privacy production.

36
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,650
So the measurable results, 92%
Directions in privacy instance, enhance

37
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,750
production against address attacks.

38
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,000
So advanced security technologies
are emerging to address unique

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,460
challenges of AI in cloud environments.

40
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,470
So these solutions enable SRE to
implement robust security measures

41
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,750
while maintaining the performance
and functionality of AI systems.

42
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,610
Next, the integration of operational
challenges, the main technical

43
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,550
ation deployment difficulties,
performance monitoring gaps,

44
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,380
the cost management complexity.

45
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,440
So SR has faced numerous
operational challenges when

46
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,900
integrating AI into cloud systems.

47
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,890
So the challenges can significantly
impact billability performance and cost

48
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,260
effectiveness, if not properly addressed.

49
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,660
So coming to operational solutions
for s. The main, A powered

50
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:22,390
monitoring, the predictive normally
detection and automated limitation.

51
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:28,090
Service missed architecture, enhanced
visibility under control across

52
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:34,000
microservices, so lops frameworks,
streamline model deployment and versioning

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,430
with the dynamic resource optimization.

54
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,690
So a resource allocation for
cost efficiency, so implementing.

55
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,230
Next generation operational solutions
can address the integration challenges

56
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:50,230
SR space or merchants adapting these
approaches has seen 92% improvements

57
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,490
in service discovery and fall a
40% reduction in operational cost.

58
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,670
So these technologies enable
SR to maintain relatability

59
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,850
while accelerating AI adoption.

60
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:04,530
So the adoption of LOP Streambox Ally
has reduced to model deployment time

61
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,750
by 78%, allowing for more frequent
updates and improvements to AI systems.

62
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,280
In production environments.

63
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,300
Next, ethical AI consideration.

64
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,680
So the main four pillars, the
fakeness and mitigation explain

65
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,700
builtin transparency, the regulatory
compliance, the human oversight.

66
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,660
So ethical considerations are
paramount when deployment,

67
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,420
deploying AI in cloud environments.

68
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,640
So SRS must work alongside a
ethics specialist to ensure systems

69
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,830
operate fairly and transparently.

70
00:04:37,655 --> 00:04:41,225
So organization is implementing
beyond system frameworks have improved

71
00:04:41,225 --> 00:04:46,085
fairness metrics by 40%, while those
with robust governance frameworks

72
00:04:46,175 --> 00:04:49,475
achieve 96.8% regulatory complaints.

73
00:04:49,975 --> 00:04:54,895
So the ethical dimensions of AI deployment
extended beyond technical implementations

74
00:04:54,895 --> 00:05:00,150
to encompass organizational values
and social impact required holistic

75
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,990
approach from technical leaders.

76
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,220
So next, implementing
responsible AI frameworks.

77
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,945
So the main model documentation we
detection mitigation explainability tools.

78
00:05:12,335 --> 00:05:12,625
Okay.

79
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,780
So implementing responsible AI frameworks
requires collaboration between SREs data

80
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,250
scientists and business stakeholders.

81
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,140
So automation that they have adopted.

82
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:26,065
Competency frameworks
report 70, 74% higher, 38%.

83
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,910
For regulatory approval for EA systems.

84
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,340
So next, the case study financial
services ca transformation.

85
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,465
So the main challenge identification,
SR lead solution designs.

86
00:05:36,745 --> 00:05:40,105
The implementation on testing
and measurable outcomes.

87
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:44,875
So this case study demonstrates
how SSRE principles when applied to

88
00:05:44,965 --> 00:05:48,775
AI Cloud integration can transform
operational performance while maintaining

89
00:05:48,775 --> 00:05:51,055
security and ethical standards.

90
00:05:51,835 --> 00:05:56,185
So the financial issues that should dis
implements while simultaneously reducing

91
00:05:56,185 --> 00:06:00,945
operational costs by 31% due to their
success was the early involvements of

92
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:03,285
SRE in the AI system and design process.

93
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,530
Ensuring deliverability and
security requirements were addressed

94
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,560
from the being other than ract.

95
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,430
So the next best practices for s the
first one, the ship ship left security.

96
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,935
So integrate security practices
early in the development lifecycle.

97
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,110
So with automated scanning and
verification for AI components.

98
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:27,310
So this approach has shown to reduce
security instance by seven, 6%

99
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,510
compared to traditional methods.

100
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:33,310
So infra code define our cloud
resources on AM model deployments

101
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:38,310
as code enabling portion control
reproducibility, and rapid recovery.

102
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,420
So our nation's using infra code for
AI deployments report at 3% faster, 30

103
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,030
recovery times, so that AIOps integration.

104
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:49,205
So leverage AI to manage ai.

105
00:06:49,835 --> 00:06:53,284
So implementing intelligent
monitoring and automated

106
00:06:53,435 --> 00:06:55,955
remediation based on pattern ations.

107
00:06:56,135 --> 00:07:01,205
So early adapters now reduced
remain time to resolution by 64%.

108
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:07,715
The finally the, so I established
knowledge sharing between data science

109
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,349
and the survey teams with regular
cross plan collaborative instance.

110
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:15,119
So this cultural practice strengths
overall system relativity.

111
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:17,579
So these are best practices form.

112
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:20,849
The foundation of successful AI
integration in cloud environments.

113
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:25,169
So automation that I have adapted
these approaches, support report

114
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:32,189
high reliability, improved security
posture, and more efficient operations.

115
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,090
So the finally the key
takeaways are next step.

116
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,869
So the integration of AI into
cloud computing presence.

117
00:07:39,184 --> 00:07:43,974
Transformative opportunities alongside
significant challenges for SR. So by

118
00:07:43,974 --> 00:07:48,835
implementing advanced security measures
like homomorphic encryption and secure

119
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:53,664
enclaves, Orions can product sense
to data while enabling AI innovation.

120
00:07:54,534 --> 00:07:58,525
So operational excellence requires
adapting AA, power monitoring service

121
00:07:58,525 --> 00:08:00,985
mesh architectures and frameworks.

122
00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:03,204
So must.

123
00:08:04,015 --> 00:08:07,705
Central to AI deployment with
frameworks for beyond objection,

124
00:08:08,065 --> 00:08:10,225
explainability and regulatory complaints.

125
00:08:10,945 --> 00:08:15,595
So our nation that successfully navigate
these challenges push themselves to

126
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:20,845
fully leverage AI potential while
maintaining that label and security

127
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,590
that modern cloud systems demand.

128
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:27,054
So the next step for most automatically
is conducting a comprehensive readiness

129
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:33,380
assessment, identifying gap areas, and
developing a. The security operational,

130
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,900
unethical consideration simultaneously.

131
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:36,730
Thank you.

132
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,110
Thank you very much.
