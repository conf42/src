00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,210
Hello, welcome to Con 42 DevOps 2025.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,070
My name is Ashok John Lagata.

3
00:00:05,189 --> 00:00:09,470
I'm going to discuss revolutionizing
data center operations using

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,180
AI driven optimizations.

5
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:15,800
in this topic, we are going to discover
how AI and ML technologies have

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,399
transformed the data center operations.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,329
And we also explore quantitative results
across our four critical domains.

8
00:00:21,919 --> 00:00:24,319
Let's, without any delay,
let's get into the topic.

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,879
let's start with the
predictive maintenance success.

10
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:32,540
We have 47 percent reduction in critical
failures, using advanced AI and ML

11
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:37,450
technologies, dramatically reduce
unexpected equipment downtime through real

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,740
time monitoring and performance testing.

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,580
Predictive analysis, and then 72 hour
predictive warning time, and then 96

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,770
percent predictive prediction accuracy.

15
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,280
Let's go to the resource
optimization achievements.

16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,180
coming to the utilization post, AI
powered systems, actually a 31 percent

17
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,155
improvement in resource utilization
rates, enabling data center to handle

18
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:01,189
40 percent more workloads, without
additional hardware investment and

19
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:04,759
latency reduction, advanced load balancing
algorithm, delivered 38 percent decrease

20
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:09,089
in Resulting in sub 10 millisecond
response time significantly enhances our

21
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:11,169
user experience across all applications.

22
00:01:11,669 --> 00:01:15,849
Coming to the energy management
breakthroughs, we can say 42% Cooling

23
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:20,369
efficiency gain by deploying smart thermal
management systems, and then optimize

24
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:24,869
airflow patterns in real time, leveraging
AI to maximize cooling effectiveness

25
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:26,179
across the data center floor.

26
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:28,859
and then PUI reduction to less than 1.

27
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,039
25.

28
00:01:29,529 --> 00:01:32,239
The industry leading power
usage, effectiveness,

29
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:32,819
achievement, and performance.

30
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:37,199
through AI driven load balancing and
intelligent resource distribution and

31
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,719
23 percent cooling cost savings, direct
operational cost reduction through

32
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:43,799
intelligence, cooling optimization
powered by deep learning models,

33
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:45,429
analyzing environmental sensors.

34
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:48,849
coming to the security, the
enhanced security framework, by

35
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,669
deploying AI and NMO, we can see 98.

36
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:56,059
5% Threat detection accuracy, our deep
learning security framework achieved

37
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,629
exceptionally precision in identifying
cyber threats, including data, data

38
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,529

and anomalous data patterns across

39
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:06,599
our distributed data center network.

40
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:09,259
And then 45 second response time.

41
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,089
Dramatically reduce, five minutes of
response time to just a 45 seconds,

42
00:02:14,609 --> 00:02:18,199
enabling rapid containment of potential
breaches and maintaining continuous

43
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:21,169
data center operations and 0.

44
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:22,759
08 percent false positives.

45
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:27,569
this is a great breakthrough through
continuous model refinement and

46
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:28,929
advanced pattern recognization.

47
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:33,399
Our AI system maintain an industry leading
low false positive rate while monitoring

48
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:37,069
over 1 million security events daily
across our data center infrastructure.

49
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:39,339
Coming to the innovative
capacity planning.

50
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,619
So there is, there is a four
different steps to approach.

51
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,719
the whole, criteria of step one is the
data collection, the aggregated real

52
00:02:47,749 --> 00:02:51,499
time server metrics, such as workload
patterns and infrastructure utilization

53
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:53,069
data across multiple data centers.

54
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:55,409
The step two is advanced analysis.

55
00:02:55,934 --> 00:03:00,204
Process 500 million plus data points
through our machine learning pipelines to

56
00:03:00,204 --> 00:03:02,054
identify usage pattern and growth trends.

57
00:03:02,564 --> 00:03:04,214
The step three is predictive insights.

58
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:09,694
Generate 12 month capacity forecast
with 96 percent accuracy using neural

59
00:03:09,694 --> 00:03:12,144
networks and time series analysis.

60
00:03:12,214 --> 00:03:13,794
And step four is implementation.

61
00:03:14,224 --> 00:03:18,914
Deploy automated infrastructure
scaling AI driven recommendations.

62
00:03:19,414 --> 00:03:20,664
Coming to the financial impact.

63
00:03:21,104 --> 00:03:21,514
Impactment.

64
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,174
Financial impact, sorry.

65
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:28,064
this 2.4 millions annual savings,
throughout optimized, throughout optimized

66
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:29,564
cooling hardware and maintenance.

67
00:03:29,634 --> 00:03:33,704
and then 2 8 2 80 5%, return
of investment rate within first

68
00:03:33,704 --> 00:03:35,024
18 months of implementation.

69
00:03:35,744 --> 00:03:40,044
and then 3.2 millions, saving
in large facilities, of the

70
00:03:40,164 --> 00:03:42,084
five megawatt plus operations.

71
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:44,944
coming to the, see these topics,
there is explanation for each.

72
00:03:45,494 --> 00:03:48,274
going to the next slide, there is,
definitely there's an integration

73
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:53,074
challenges, from a traditional model to
the AI driven model, but AI driven, the

74
00:03:53,074 --> 00:03:58,669
advantage of AI driven model is, for
example, dealing with legacy systems, For

75
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:02,179
example, if you take a migration, there
is, there's always a challenges, but using

76
00:04:02,179 --> 00:04:07,489
AI technologies, we can reduce 19, the
maintenance time, the maintenance time

77
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:10,229
and then uptime, going to increase to 99.

78
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:10,639
9%.

79
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:14,989
And the data quality, the
implementing rigorous data validation.

80
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:19,849
protocols and standardization of
frameworks to transform desperate

81
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:24,829
data sources into a written farmers
across 50 plus enterprise databases.

82
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:27,249
And then skill gap can be reduced.

83
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:31,399
and then, cultural shift, from
traditional to the AI model is very fast.

84
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:36,469
coming to the case study snapshot,
this models are not only for the.

85
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:41,929
simple or small scale data center, this
is also, this can be easily implemented

86
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:44,309
from small to medium to the large.

87
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:49,189
coming to the future AI adoption
roadmaps, there is, four steps

88
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,169
we can take into the future.

89
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:55,569
Step one is edge computing integration,
implementation of distributed AI.

90
00:04:56,069 --> 00:05:00,489
Processing at facility edges to enable
real time decision making and reduce

91
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:05,439
latency and then quantum AI hybrid
