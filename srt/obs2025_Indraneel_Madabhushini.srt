00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,140
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:03,800
Thank you for joining me today at Con 42.

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:08,680
My name is, and I'm honored to present
on the topic of transforming public

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,690
sector observability using artificial
intelligence and business intelligence

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,300
with over 12 years of experience.

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,170
As I said, the business objects
business warehouse and Power BI

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:26,050
specialist and experience on having on
working on Microsoft Power BI Stack.

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,770
I've led digital transformation
initiatives for major enterprises,

9
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,250
including Nestle, USA, Siemens, and artex.

10
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,900
Currently I serve as a principal
developer and analyst at I Global Tech.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,040
Where I focus on bridging the gap
between the technical data solutions

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,405
and real world public sector needs.

13
00:00:46,905 --> 00:00:51,935
Today's session is designed to equip you
with the understanding and tools needed

14
00:00:51,935 --> 00:00:54,695
to evolve the public sector observability.

15
00:00:55,235 --> 00:01:01,235
We'll explore how to use ai, bi,
and modern data platforms to convert

16
00:01:01,265 --> 00:01:06,845
the fragmented system telemetry into
actionable intelligence that improves

17
00:01:07,055 --> 00:01:08,795
service delivery and public trust.

18
00:01:09,295 --> 00:01:12,505
Observability challenge when we come
up to the observability challenge.

19
00:01:12,565 --> 00:01:16,015
Let's begin by acknowledging
the the core challenges faced

20
00:01:16,015 --> 00:01:18,535
by public sector agencies.

21
00:01:19,215 --> 00:01:20,955
First complexity overload.

22
00:01:21,485 --> 00:01:25,965
Data is being generated across
the multiple disconnected systems,

23
00:01:26,115 --> 00:01:31,020
including mainframes, modern cloud
platforms, and and customer databases.

24
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,550
This fragmented environment makes
it incredibly difficult to gain

25
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,140
a full picture of operations.

26
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,540
Second visibility gaps key insights are
often buried within individual systems.

27
00:01:43,955 --> 00:01:48,060
These silos prevent leaders from
understanding the end-to-end

28
00:01:48,065 --> 00:01:49,785
flow of services and outcomes.

29
00:01:50,475 --> 00:01:53,805
For example, the performance
issues in a backend tax processing

30
00:01:53,805 --> 00:01:59,065
system might go undetected until
constraints begin experiencing delays.

31
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:01,945
And the third one would be
the reactive operations.

32
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,955
Too often most of the enterprises only.

33
00:02:05,345 --> 00:02:08,255
Become aware of issues after
a disruption has occurred.

34
00:02:08,825 --> 00:02:13,935
And this not only reduces the service
quality, but also erodes the customer's

35
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:19,035
trust and and the agency's ability
to fulfill its mission effectively

36
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:21,125
modern observative framework to.

37
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:26,306
To address these challenges, we
introduce a modern observative framework

38
00:02:26,335 --> 00:02:27,535
which is built in four pillars.

39
00:02:28,465 --> 00:02:31,485
First one would be the business
intelligence, where we use the

40
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:36,715
business BI tools like Power bi to
transform the disparate law, raw

41
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:39,805
data into dashboards and score.

42
00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:45,035
And this enables decision makers to
proactively monitor and manage services.

43
00:02:45,725 --> 00:02:48,675
Second one would be the AI
powered artificial intelligence

44
00:02:48,775 --> 00:02:52,385
which plays a critical role in
predicting the system behaviors.

45
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:58,135
Identifying the hidden patterns
or finding out the anomalies, and

46
00:02:58,135 --> 00:02:59,905
recommending the preventative actions.

47
00:02:59,955 --> 00:03:04,245
Machine learning models detect
issues before they escalate.

48
00:03:04,995 --> 00:03:09,465
Third one would be the data integration
where true observability requires merging

49
00:03:09,465 --> 00:03:15,765
data from all systems regardless of vendor
location or format into a single view.

50
00:03:16,425 --> 00:03:20,985
This unified approach of allows for
seamless data analysis across agencies.

51
00:03:21,825 --> 00:03:24,165
And the fourth one would be the
core monitoring where we have the

52
00:03:24,165 --> 00:03:25,935
comprehensive collection of metrics.

53
00:03:26,435 --> 00:03:31,120
Which are very, which are pretty
continuous and and continuous logs, traces

54
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,220
and events without a robust telemetry.

55
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,720
Foundation it is impossible to gain
real visibility into the health and

56
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,350
and the performance of the services.

57
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,300
These frameworks allows the
public sector teams to shift

58
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,890
from reactor to the predictive
Operations Technical Foundation.

59
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,990
So let's, when we explore this
framework, it is, which is technically

60
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:56,850
implemented at the data collection,
where we establish the pipelines.

61
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:02,230
To acquire the telemetry data from
legacy on-prem systems to cloud services,

62
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,173
third party APIs and IOT devices.

63
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,629
This requires the co connectors,
agents, or integration services

64
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:11,409
that that normalize the data.

65
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:19,369
And a centralized analytics engine often
built using star spark Databricks similar

66
00:04:19,369 --> 00:04:21,679
platforms, processing incoming telemetry.

67
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:25,260
It correlates logs with
performance metrics and

68
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,210
generates insights in real time.

69
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,400
The next one would be the storage.

70
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:34,469
For compliance purposes, we store
data in secure cloud-based data lakes.

71
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,349
Or warehouses.

72
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:40,699
Solutions like Azure data Lake or
Snowflake are ideal because they

73
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:44,770
offer the encryption for data and
and which has also have the role

74
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,859
based access and max accountability.

75
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:51,389
Next one would be the visualization
where dashboards are tailored

76
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,249
to specific agency roles.

77
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:56,079
Which includes these agency roles.

78
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,719
When we talk about the agency
roles, it's like the role based

79
00:04:58,809 --> 00:05:02,889
role based, access related dashboard
where it involves executive level,

80
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:04,404
operational level, and technical level.

81
00:05:04,854 --> 00:05:10,604
Power BI and Tableau and SAP
business objects serve these needs by

82
00:05:10,604 --> 00:05:15,794
offering the customizable real time
visual layers that align with KPIs.

83
00:05:16,544 --> 00:05:21,644
This layered architecture ensures that
the data is being trusted, timely,

84
00:05:21,644 --> 00:05:25,104
and actionable based, actionable
insights for the enterprises.

85
00:05:25,604 --> 00:05:27,074
Transformation success stories.

86
00:05:27,154 --> 00:05:30,304
Here are the three real world
examples, which I, based on my

87
00:05:30,304 --> 00:05:33,874
experience, which I would highlight
the effectiveness of this framework.

88
00:05:34,664 --> 00:05:38,084
First one would be the legacy
migration where we revolutionize

89
00:05:38,084 --> 00:05:42,974
the nest USA's outdated monitoring
infrastructure with seamless integration

90
00:05:42,974 --> 00:05:44,604
of modern observability tools.

91
00:05:45,374 --> 00:05:46,155
And also.

92
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:47,224
The aging.

93
00:05:47,224 --> 00:05:51,784
We Nestle used to have the aging
monitoring system that couldn't scale or

94
00:05:52,354 --> 00:05:54,184
provide the cross-functional visibility.

95
00:05:54,184 --> 00:05:57,575
We introduced the modern
observability tools indicated

96
00:05:57,575 --> 00:05:58,994
with their existing landscape.

97
00:05:59,654 --> 00:06:03,304
This resulted in a 40% faster
incident response time and and

98
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:06,394
significantly improved the IT
and business team collaboration.

99
00:06:06,894 --> 00:06:09,544
Next one would be the would be sware.

100
00:06:09,544 --> 00:06:13,664
We created the cross-platform
observability ecosystem that merged 12

101
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,584
plus data streams into a unified view.

102
00:06:16,914 --> 00:06:19,744
And this gave Siemens the
operational leaders the ability

103
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:24,994
to see end-to-end service health,
reducing the system downtime by 35%.

104
00:06:25,494 --> 00:06:30,819
Next one would be the, with Arthrex,
where the company needed a way to identify

105
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,999
the performance degradation before it
affected operations, where we implemented

106
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:39,349
an AI driven no detection system
that flagged early signs of failure.

107
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,719
Then this way a solution prevented
almost 28 major incidents in a year and

108
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:49,089
saved up to $1.5 million in potential
downtime cost, downtime costs, and

109
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:51,009
to, and to avoid the disruptions.

110
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:55,049
These stories show how the
observatory goes beyond the monitoring

111
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:58,919
and it empowers the predictive
operations implementation roadmap.

112
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,109
Where we implementing the observability
in public sector organizations

113
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,079
requires a systematic phased approach.

114
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,209
And and the first one would be the
assessment where we evaluate the current

115
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:14,679
monitoring capabilities, where we begin
conducting the detailed inventory of

116
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:19,669
of your existing monitoring tools, data
sources and workflows, evaluate gaps,

117
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,830
redundancies, and compliance risks.

118
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:22,669
The.

119
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:28,974
Stage should also I mean involve the
cross-functional teams to understand

120
00:07:28,974 --> 00:07:32,374
their their burning issues of the
bottlenecks that they're gonna face

121
00:07:32,374 --> 00:07:35,904
when they're trying to implement
the, implement This, data points

122
00:07:36,404 --> 00:07:39,824
architecture would be the second step
where we design the observability

123
00:07:39,824 --> 00:07:41,684
architecture based on the assessment.

124
00:07:41,974 --> 00:07:44,654
Define which telemetry
signals need to be collected.

125
00:07:45,374 --> 00:07:51,139
The a TL workflows is needed and
ai ml models to be deployed storage

126
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:53,359
schemas and visual interfaces.

127
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,484
Prioritize, prioritizing this
modular and scalable design.

128
00:07:58,264 --> 00:07:59,914
And the third one would be
the implementation where

129
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:01,234
we roll out in phases.

130
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:07,379
Start with the proof of concept in a
high priority service and such as backend

131
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:12,599
and emergency response systems and and
con configuring the alerting rules AI

132
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:16,349
triggers and dashboards where we use
the agile sprints to a iterate quickly.

133
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:20,959
And the adoption would be the fourth
one where we, where the technology alone

134
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:26,019
doesn't guarantee success, where we
trade staff on the observability tools

135
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:31,589
establish documentation and onboard
executive champions create feedback loops

136
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:36,929
and continuous me measure usage, system
performance, and user satisfaction.

137
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:42,129
So by this roadmap, the agencies can
avoid and our enterprises can avoid.

138
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,284
Most of the companies can avoid
the analysis para paralysis and and

139
00:08:46,284 --> 00:08:50,435
achieve the, measurable progress
in three to six months, or the

140
00:08:50,435 --> 00:08:53,905
desired time period, which we, which
during the product planning phase.

141
00:08:54,405 --> 00:09:00,724
The next one would be the technology
stack where this gives you the effective

142
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:04,614
observability on well integrated
technology stack which has a bunch

143
00:09:04,614 --> 00:09:09,849
of tools where which is, describes
the, describes its own importance on

144
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:15,409
performing the front end and and backend
calculations, and also back, and also

145
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:16,999
performing the machine learning stuff.

146
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:20,859
Power bi, which is a leading
visualization platform where it

147
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:26,019
provides the customizable dashboards
that pull in realtime data through APIs

148
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:28,509
and direct query and import models.

149
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:32,949
Power BI also supports the role level
security, which is also added for the

150
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:36,614
sensitive public sector data or and
on and also in private organizations,

151
00:09:37,454 --> 00:09:41,034
SAP business objects, which is, which
remains critical for agencies that

152
00:09:41,034 --> 00:09:43,644
require a governed enterprise reporting.

153
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:48,019
Compliance based scheduling and
complex report logic where where

154
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:51,679
most of the semantic model has been
performed in business objects and

155
00:09:51,729 --> 00:09:53,589
s business objects has disparate.

156
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:58,019
Values, and connecting to disparate
data sources which integrates

157
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:02,349
with the S-A-P-E-C-C-I, which is a
backend business warehouse and other

158
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:06,759
ERP systems, Azure, and Snowflake,
which serves as a infrastructure

159
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,349
and the data warehouse layers.

160
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,989
Azure supports identity management.

161
00:10:11,454 --> 00:10:13,254
Data pipelines and AI services.

162
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:18,054
Snowflake provides a fast, scalable
storage and built-in support for

163
00:10:18,054 --> 00:10:19,884
semi-structured and unstructured data.

164
00:10:20,574 --> 00:10:25,824
So Databricks, which powers advanced
machine learning, it supports time

165
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:32,124
series forecasting, anomaly detection,
and NLP on on logs or customer feedback.

166
00:10:32,784 --> 00:10:33,984
So this Databricks.

167
00:10:34,264 --> 00:10:39,364
Notebooks also allow for the flexible
experimentation by data scientists,

168
00:10:39,364 --> 00:10:42,614
and this stack is chosen, not for
the technical strength, but also

169
00:10:42,614 --> 00:10:46,094
for the compliance, scalability,
and long-term cost effectiveness.

170
00:10:46,594 --> 00:10:47,554
ROA metrics.

171
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:52,184
When agencies invest in observability
and measurable outcomes what can

172
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,914
they expect is what this showcases.

173
00:10:54,914 --> 00:10:58,664
The, our observability solutions
majorly deliver the measurable returns

174
00:10:59,054 --> 00:11:00,429
across key performance indicators.

175
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:04,169
With significant improvements in
operational efficiency and service

176
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:09,599
quality, the fast flow incident re
resolution would be the highest KPI, which

177
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:14,209
would instead of spending the spending
hours diagnosing root causes, teams can

178
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:19,819
ask, isolate issues in minutes using
correlation dashboards and AI alerts.

179
00:11:20,444 --> 00:11:23,774
We have seen resolution
times drop by up to 50%.

180
00:11:24,494 --> 00:11:26,924
So improved uptime
would be the second KPI.

181
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:31,574
With with the productive alerts
and proactive maintenance uptime

182
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:33,344
SLAs improved dramatically.

183
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:36,759
This means the fewer customer
complaints and higher service

184
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:39,549
continuity and better audit readiness.

185
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,689
Increased staff productivity would
be the third one where analysts

186
00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:46,929
and engineers spend less time
annually stitching together data

187
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:51,159
with the centralized dashboards and
they've, they majorly focus on the

188
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,869
improvements rather than firefighting.

189
00:11:53,739 --> 00:11:55,299
Reduce the operational costs.

190
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:59,399
Where, which, in which reduces
the manual interventions contact

191
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,619
escalations and downtime related
penalties in several projects.

192
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:07,789
A total all operational costs
dropped by 20% within a year.

193
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:12,339
So higher customer satisfaction where
the customers, most of the customers

194
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:17,319
don't notice when things go right,
but they do when the systems fail.

195
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,199
Improving the uptime and,
responsiveness, enhances public

196
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,849
trust and stakeholder confidence.

197
00:12:22,929 --> 00:12:27,949
Typically the investment in observability
pays for itself within nine to 12 months.

198
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:32,040
Next one would be the common
implementation challenges where the.

199
00:12:32,469 --> 00:12:36,524
Security complaints where the
public companies public assure

200
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,279
companies must come, must comply
with stringent data regulations.

201
00:12:40,849 --> 00:12:45,113
It's essential to choose tools that
are FedRAMP and FSMA compliant and

202
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:48,749
and implement strict access controls
across your observability stack.

203
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:53,059
And second would be the data integration
complexity where legacy systems often

204
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:55,699
lack APIs or standardized formats.

205
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:01,579
Teams need to build custom ETL
pipelines, use middleware, and

206
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:03,169
sometimes reverse engineer logs.

207
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:08,209
Data integration is the hardest
part, but also the most rewarding.

208
00:13:08,869 --> 00:13:11,429
The next one would be the
cultural resistance or where

209
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:13,309
observability shift the most.

210
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:16,409
Cultural resistance or organizational
adoption where most of the.

211
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:19,609
Observability shifts
the way people work it.

212
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:23,449
It requires transparency,
accountability, and data literacy.

213
00:13:23,849 --> 00:13:28,529
Some teams may resist change, fearing
loss of control and increased scrutiny.

214
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,939
That's why the executive
sponsorship and and cross training

215
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:33,829
is more significant and vital.

216
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:37,849
Next one would be the budget constraints
where where a, where most of the

217
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:42,279
companies often operate within tight
budgets and long procurement cycles.

218
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:48,509
Start with the high ROI pilot and
measure value early and secure.

219
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:50,609
The incremental funding to scale further.

220
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:54,419
Anticipating these challenges allows
for the smoother implementation

221
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:55,789
and higher adoption rates.

222
00:13:56,289 --> 00:13:57,459
Next steps would be.

223
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:01,199
Would be to find out the
observability of your organization.

224
00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:04,139
To bring the observability
to the, your organization.

225
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:08,449
Here are the practical steps where
observability assessment, which evaluates

226
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:13,174
your current monitoring capabilities and
identify the key gaps where we, where

227
00:14:13,234 --> 00:14:17,739
it, where it is needed to run a two to
four week internal review to evaluate

228
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:23,349
what's being monitored and what's
missing, and who owns which data streams.

229
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,784
Map out the telemetry architecture.

230
00:14:26,504 --> 00:14:30,059
And next one would be this would be
the pilot implementation where we

231
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:34,259
select the pilot use case, where we
choose a high visibility service such

232
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:35,999
as the customer portal, performance.

233
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:40,529
Distributor, if there is any distribution,
monitoring, or emergency services

234
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,879
response team or something like that.

235
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:45,859
And demonstrate a tangible
which demonstrate the tangible

236
00:14:45,989 --> 00:14:47,759
results within 30 to 60 days.

237
00:14:48,729 --> 00:14:52,989
And also building the strategic roadmap
where we develop the phased approach to

238
00:14:52,989 --> 00:14:58,059
full observability implementation, where
we define short, midterm, long-term goals,

239
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:03,159
which includes tool standardization, AI
model expansion, and training models.

240
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,749
And, ensure the alignment with
the agency's digital strategy.

241
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:12,399
Investment in training and literacy
would be the, another observability

242
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:15,999
where we, which also comes under
the cap capability building.

243
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:21,179
And this observability is, it's for
the analysts leadership and operations

244
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:24,239
team, and we offering the workshops.

245
00:15:24,494 --> 00:15:28,124
Create document, creating the
documentation and fostering for

246
00:15:28,124 --> 00:15:31,804
the cultural culture of the data
driven decision making would be

247
00:15:31,804 --> 00:15:33,664
the best one under this category.

248
00:15:33,664 --> 00:15:38,774
And also it also if the
internal bandwidth is limited.

249
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:42,909
Then it's considered to be engaging the
experienced partner to accelerate the

250
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:45,789
design, deployment and change management.

251
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:51,039
So transformation doesn't have to
be big bang but start with one one

252
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,149
use case, and then I. Deliver the
success and scale it interactively.

253
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:58,079
Thank you for spending
this time with me today.

254
00:15:58,229 --> 00:16:01,919
I hope you know, have a clear vision
of how AI and business intelligence

255
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,669
can elevate observability across
public sector organizations.

256
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:10,604
Whether you're just a beginning or a
scaling existing efforts, the opportunity

257
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:12,494
is vast and the impact is real.

258
00:16:12,994 --> 00:16:18,069
I welcome your your questions and and
thanks for connecting and let's work

259
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:22,184
together to transform the vis into
the visibility into mission success.

260
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:22,744
Thank you.
