1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,810
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,180
Welcome to Con 42, Chaos
Engineering 2025 Conference.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,120
I am Sandeep Batu, and I bring over a
decade of experience in building and

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,190
securing cloud and hybrid platforms.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,009
I will be discussing about the
cloud security strategies in

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,770
an era of evolving threats.

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,870
Let's talk about how the digital
landscape is rapidly changing with

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,650
the cloud adoption, and, where.

9
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:29,960
Things are, where cyber attacks
are becoming increasingly

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,300
sophisticated as well.

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,010
So traditional parameter based
security is no longer enough to protect

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,440
organizations from these evolving threats.

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,790
Coming to the aspects of the cloud
security, let's talk about how

14
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:49,339
the accelerated cloud adoption is
transforming the industry where

15
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:54,919
94 percent of the enterprises have
embraced these cloud services.

16
00:00:55,425 --> 00:00:59,275
which is an historic shift
in how business operates.

17
00:00:59,655 --> 00:01:06,275
So industry analysts predict that by
2025, over 75 percent of the enterprise

18
00:01:06,294 --> 00:01:11,705
workloads will reside in the cloud,
representing a transformation which

19
00:01:11,745 --> 00:01:17,414
demands an equally dramatic evolution
in the, in how the security approaches.

20
00:01:17,914 --> 00:01:24,455
And how the rising cyber
attacks is changing.

21
00:01:24,815 --> 00:01:25,595
The industry.

22
00:01:25,945 --> 00:01:32,654
So as the rapid cloud adoption
has created and expanded.

23
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:38,649
Attack surface, organizations are
now facing an alarming rate of, huge

24
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:45,640
cyber attacks daily, where we can
say that, there is almost an, every

25
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,359
attack for every 39 seconds, these are
not just simple breaches, but these

26
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:57,529
are like sophisticated multi vector
attacks, which can cost companies, huge

27
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:00,604
millions, for every incident out there.

28
00:02:00,644 --> 00:02:05,434
So making Robo's cloud security
is not just important, but

29
00:02:05,434 --> 00:02:08,064
also it's business critical.

30
00:02:08,844 --> 00:02:14,274
So let's talk about The
shift towards the Zero Trust.

31
00:02:14,684 --> 00:02:15,474
Zero Trust.

32
00:02:15,974 --> 00:02:17,944
What exactly is Zero Trust principle?

33
00:02:17,964 --> 00:02:22,794
implementing continuous verifications
for every user, device, and application

34
00:02:22,794 --> 00:02:24,334
regardless of location, right?

35
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:30,494
So this is almost like never trust
and always verify approach where it

36
00:02:30,494 --> 00:02:35,104
requires multi factor authentication,
real time monitoring, and granular

37
00:02:35,144 --> 00:02:38,064
access control across all the resources.

38
00:02:38,774 --> 00:02:42,964
And the next is the
reduced security incidents.

39
00:02:43,574 --> 00:02:49,494
Organizations are implementing zero
trust organi Organizations implementing

40
00:02:49,494 --> 00:02:55,894
zero trust architectures have witnessed,
dramatic 60 percent reduction in security

41
00:02:55,974 --> 00:03:02,714
incidents, which includes preventing
unauthorized access attempts, detecting

42
00:03:02,764 --> 00:03:08,554
insider threats, and Early, and also
minimizing the impact of PO potential

43
00:03:08,554 --> 00:03:14,324
breaches through some of the micro
segments, strategies by implementing

44
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:17,504
net, network access controls or VPNs.

45
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:24,284
Next, let's talk about how the
identity access management is

46
00:03:24,854 --> 00:03:27,194
helping some of these concerns.

47
00:03:27,649 --> 00:03:33,949
One, by leveraging the advanced IAM
policies, where we deploy granular access

48
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:36,599
control with role based permissions.

49
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:43,759
and also leveraging the just in time
access, and also the automated privilege

50
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:49,129
management to create robust security
parameters around the critical assets.

51
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,239
And the next is the multi
factor authentication.

52
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:57,959
So implementing sophisticated multi
factor authentication, which includes

53
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:03,659
combining of like biometrics or
hardware tokens or time based codes.

54
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:10,859
So organizations using this multi
factor authentication reports that, 99

55
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:13,949
percent of fewer account compromises.

56
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:20,099
And also 67 percent of, reduction in
the breaches, which is pretty huge.

57
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:25,289
Next, let's talk about the leveraging
AI and machine learning for these

58
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:30,379
threat detections, accelerated threat
detection, where we'll talk about

59
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:36,059
how the advanced AI and ML powered
security tools enable organizations

60
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:42,239
to identify and respond to threats
50 times faster than the traditional.

61
00:04:42,494 --> 00:04:43,734
manual methods.

62
00:04:43,904 --> 00:04:48,784
analyzing millions of data points
in real time to spot potential

63
00:04:48,794 --> 00:04:50,514
breaches before they occur.

64
00:04:51,494 --> 00:04:56,714
And, talking about intellect,
intelligent behavior analytics.

65
00:04:57,074 --> 00:05:02,144
some of this sophisticated behavior
analytics and pattern recognition,

66
00:05:02,604 --> 00:05:09,224
helps in achieving, around like 76
percent reduction in false positives.

67
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:15,974
So allowing security teams to
focus on genuine threats while

68
00:05:15,974 --> 00:05:21,034
maintaining the operational
efficiency will help organizations.

69
00:05:21,804 --> 00:05:23,904
focus on the real threats.

70
00:05:24,404 --> 00:05:28,304
Next we can talk about the
quantum resistant encryption

71
00:05:28,304 --> 00:05:30,334
and blockchain technologies.

72
00:05:30,694 --> 00:05:37,824
implementing some of the quantum resistant
encryption, which mostly focus about the

73
00:05:37,914 --> 00:05:43,924
post quantum cryptographic algorithms,
which can withstand attacks from

74
00:05:43,934 --> 00:05:47,444
both classical and quantum computers.

75
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:54,189
So these cryptographic algorithms helps
organizations in securing themselves.

76
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:59,899
So some of the advanced encryption
methods like lattice based or hash

77
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:05,199
based cryptographies, which helps
in ensuring that the data remains

78
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:11,469
secure even as, quantum computing
capability, capabilities evolve.

79
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:13,809
Next, we can also leverage the.

80
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:15,979
Blockchain technology.

81
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:22,079
So leveraging the distributed ledger
technology to create a tamper proof

82
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:28,719
audit trails and smart contracts for
all these automated security protocols,

83
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:36,429
which helps in decentralized approach,
ensuring that 99 percent of the uptime

84
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:41,859
of the resources and also or reduce
a single point of failure and then

85
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:47,959
provides cryptographic proof of data
integrity across the cloud environments.

86
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:52,779
If we are looking at the micro
segmentation, and so all the

87
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:57,509
securities right, so coming to the
micro segmentation, We can transform

88
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:02,709
the network security by creating
granular and isolated segments,

89
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:05,309
which can reduce the attack surface.

90
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:10,169
So this is almost like a zero trust
approach, which contains, breaches

91
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:16,229
and enables, precise access control,
and also cuts lateral movements of

92
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:20,749
the risk by implementing security
policies at the workload level.

93
00:07:21,249 --> 00:07:25,214
And we can also leverage
the serverless security.

94
00:07:25,984 --> 00:07:30,964
So which uses a native security
features in serverless architectures

95
00:07:31,324 --> 00:07:34,514
to achieve both agility and protection.

96
00:07:34,824 --> 00:07:39,944
So the function level isolation,
automated scalings, and also the event

97
00:07:39,944 --> 00:07:46,284
driven security controls, all these
create a dynamic defense systems, which

98
00:07:46,374 --> 00:07:52,184
eliminates most of the traditional
infrastructure vulnerabilities.

99
00:07:52,684 --> 00:07:57,714
And also we can leverage the continuous
compliance automation, right?

100
00:07:58,114 --> 00:08:01,344
We can implement automated
compliance check.

101
00:08:01,874 --> 00:08:07,104
which streamlines the regulatory,
through the continuous monitoring

102
00:08:07,104 --> 00:08:12,204
systems, which can scan, validate,
and document compliance requirements

103
00:08:12,214 --> 00:08:19,224
in real time, and also reducing the
manual audit preparation, almost by

104
00:08:20,144 --> 00:08:23,384
ensuring there is a 99 percent accuracy.

105
00:08:24,264 --> 00:08:30,604
And the second is the real time risk
assessment, Deploy AI powered REST

106
00:08:30,634 --> 00:08:34,744
detection systems, which analyze
compliance patterns across the

107
00:08:34,744 --> 00:08:40,154
regulatory framework, which enables
organizations to identify and address

108
00:08:40,474 --> 00:08:46,384
potential violations, even before,
things happen with these audits.

109
00:08:47,014 --> 00:08:52,484
Next is a cost optimization, achieving
a significant ROI through all this

110
00:08:52,504 --> 00:09:00,444
automated compliance process, which helps
enterprises savings, huge amounts annually

111
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:04,474
through the reduced manual effort,
fewer penalties and also optimized,

112
00:09:04,974 --> 00:09:06,774
optimizing the resource allocation.

113
00:09:07,274 --> 00:09:11,354
And coming to the industry best
practices and case studies, some of

114
00:09:11,354 --> 00:09:17,744
the real world examples which dive
into the detailed case studies from the

115
00:09:17,744 --> 00:09:23,344
fortune 500 companies, which achieved
99 percent security compliance through

116
00:09:24,104 --> 00:09:26,974
cloud native security implementations.

117
00:09:27,324 --> 00:09:32,354
which includes the financial institutions
which, which reduce the breach and

118
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:36,694
also some of the healthcare providers
which enhance the data protection

119
00:09:37,134 --> 00:09:39,724
while improving the access speeds.

120
00:09:40,634 --> 00:09:46,754
And some of the experts in the industry
says with the help of these strategies.

121
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:55,499
A lot of knowledge has been gained
and also security architects at

122
00:09:55,499 --> 00:10:00,139
the leading tech companies have
successfully defended and against these

123
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:02,369
sophisticated cyber attacks as well.

124
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:07,139
And also some of these proven
threat detection models.

125
00:10:07,844 --> 00:10:12,124
Helps in incident response
and also security architecture

126
00:10:12,124 --> 00:10:17,454
which can immediately apply
to most of the organizations.

127
00:10:17,954 --> 00:10:23,634
So some of the key takeaways and
also the actionable insights from

128
00:10:23,674 --> 00:10:29,714
all these cloud security strategies
is one, implement the zero trust.

129
00:10:30,234 --> 00:10:35,744
So transform your security posture by
adopting the zero trust architecture,

130
00:10:36,144 --> 00:10:40,634
which reduces the breach by 60 percent
through continuous verification of

131
00:10:40,694 --> 00:10:42,674
every user device and connection.

132
00:10:43,174 --> 00:10:48,784
Second, how we can modernize the identity
controls, implementing the robust

133
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:55,154
identity access management frameworks with
biometrics, multi factor authentications,

134
00:10:55,504 --> 00:11:04,034
which reduces the unauthorized access
by 99%, and also enhances the user

135
00:11:04,034 --> 00:11:08,404
experience, around the MFA process itself.

136
00:11:08,904 --> 00:11:15,134
And the next is, how we can
accelerate, with leveraging some

137
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:17,594
of the AI and ML algorithms.

138
00:11:17,604 --> 00:11:22,874
So deploying the intelligent threat
detection, which are powered by AI or

139
00:11:22,884 --> 00:11:29,104
ML to identify threats faster and also
reducing the false positive, which

140
00:11:29,174 --> 00:11:32,384
enables the rapid incidence response.

141
00:11:33,304 --> 00:11:34,864
around the real threats.

142
00:11:35,364 --> 00:11:39,094
How we can secure the future using
the collaborative approach, right?

143
00:11:39,534 --> 00:11:46,344
In, building the secure future
together is one of the core

144
00:11:46,384 --> 00:11:48,974
principles for every organization.

145
00:11:49,434 --> 00:11:54,804
So in today's interconnected
digital landscape, collaboration

146
00:11:54,804 --> 00:12:00,679
and information sharing between
the organizations have become the

147
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,839
cornerstone for effective cyber security.

148
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:10,359
So we have to foster these partnerships
between the private enterprises and some

149
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:15,579
of the security researchers and also
we can create more resilient defense

150
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,269
against the sophisticated cyber threats.

151
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:26,134
So through shade intelligence coordinating
the how the incident response should

152
00:12:26,144 --> 00:12:32,024
happen and also the collaborative
innovations we can build more secure

153
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:34,474
digital ecosystem for everyone.

154
00:12:34,974 --> 00:12:35,934
Thanks for your time.
