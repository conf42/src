00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,730
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,030
My name is Sai Chiran, and today I'm
excited to talk about a technology

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:08,340
that is redefining how we connect and
communicate in an increasingly digital

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,360
world, software defined networking.

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,990
We are living in a world where
connectivity is no longer

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,510
a luxury, it's a necessity.

7
00:00:15,874 --> 00:00:20,154
Consider this every second over
127 new devices are connected to

8
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:23,904
this internet from smart homes
and autonomous vehicles to remote

9
00:00:23,904 --> 00:00:25,574
surgeries and industrial automation.

10
00:00:25,844 --> 00:00:28,924
Our world is becoming more connected
and intelligent by the minute.

11
00:00:29,794 --> 00:00:31,625
But with this growth comes a challenge.

12
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:33,925
A traditional networks
are struggling to keep up.

13
00:00:34,165 --> 00:00:39,275
Today, I'll show you how SDN is not just
solving this challenge, but also paving

14
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:41,694
the way for the future of IOT and 5G.

15
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,095
This is more than just a technology.

16
00:00:44,155 --> 00:00:46,254
It's a foundation of our
hyper connected world.

17
00:00:46,754 --> 00:00:49,704
Let's discuss about
the rise of IOT and 5G.

18
00:00:49,704 --> 00:00:55,004
By 2025, the number of connected devices
is expected to exceed 75 billion.

19
00:00:55,434 --> 00:01:00,354
This rapid expansion of IOT ecosystems
presents unprecedented scaling challenges.

20
00:01:00,714 --> 00:01:05,794
Demanding networks that are intelligent
and adaptive 5g further raises the

21
00:01:05,794 --> 00:01:11,374
stakes with ultra low latency under one
milliseconds which enables Real time

22
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:15,974
applications like autonomous driving
and remote surgeries speeds exceeding

23
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:22,009
20 gbps Supporting high definition
streaming and immersive AR VR experiences.

24
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:27,129
Traditional network architecture
are rigid and hardware centric.

25
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:30,849
Unable to meet these dynamic demands,
this is where software defined

26
00:01:30,849 --> 00:01:35,329
networking steps in by decoupling the
control plane from the data plane.

27
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:38,479
SDN enables intelligent
resource allocations.

28
00:01:38,714 --> 00:01:41,584
Centralized control and
unmatched network flexibility.

29
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:46,304
Let's discuss about the
transformative paradigm in SDN.

30
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:50,304
SDN is revolutionary for
three primary reasons.

31
00:01:50,914 --> 00:01:51,874
Centralized control.

32
00:01:52,344 --> 00:01:56,134
SDN centralizes network management
through a single control plane,

33
00:01:56,435 --> 00:02:00,134
allowing real time programmability
and efficient resource utilization.

34
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:04,384
This enhances operational
efficiency and enables rapid

35
00:02:04,384 --> 00:02:06,314
implementation of network policies.

36
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:10,014
Number two, which is
dynamic resource allocation.

37
00:02:10,274 --> 00:02:14,404
It intelligently distributes bandwidth
and computing resources as needed.

38
00:02:14,764 --> 00:02:18,064
Optimizing network performance
even during peak usages.

39
00:02:18,614 --> 00:02:19,834
Enhance flexibility.

40
00:02:20,144 --> 00:02:24,194
SDN eliminates hardware dependencies
through software based network

41
00:02:25,094 --> 00:02:29,984
configurations, allowing networks to
adapt instantly to changing requirements.

42
00:02:30,594 --> 00:02:34,264
These capabilities transform
traditional static networks into

43
00:02:34,294 --> 00:02:39,749
agile, programmable platforms that can
support the complexities of IoT and 5G.

44
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:44,009
Now let's move on to software
defined networking in smart cities.

45
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:48,949
In smart cities, SDN enables
intelligent infrastructure management

46
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:50,519
and operational efficiencies.

rapid response to infrastructure issues,

52
00:03:12,684 --> 00:03:14,584
and minimizing service disruptions.

53
00:03:15,204 --> 00:03:19,564
From adaptive traffic management to
efficient public utilities, software

54
00:03:19,564 --> 00:03:23,884
defined networking plays a crucial
role in making urban environments more

55
00:03:23,884 --> 00:03:26,074
efficient, sustainable, and resilient.

56
00:03:27,004 --> 00:03:32,504
Now, let's move on to software defined
networking in an industrial IoT.

57
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:37,384
SDN is also transforming industrial
IoT by providing dynamic network

Seamless integration.

83
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:10,839
Complex integration with legacy
systems and diverse communication

84
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:15,249
protocols is a significant barrier
and it comes with latency bottlenecks,

85
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:19,019
which where centralized control
architectures can introduce latency

86
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,929
in time sensitive applications.
