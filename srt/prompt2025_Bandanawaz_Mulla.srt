1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,160
Hey guys.

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:02,720
Thanks for joining me.

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:10,520
This is ULA and I have around two
decades of IT experience and most

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:16,450
of my experience is providing
healthcare solutions in cloud and ai.

5
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:22,270
Today I would like to talk about a
solution we recently implemented for a

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,860
federal or CMS mandate where we support.

7
00:00:27,325 --> 00:00:34,255
More than 2 million Medicare member,
and this mandate is about how do

8
00:00:34,255 --> 00:00:39,985
we ensure our Medicare members
utilize their supplemental benefits?

9
00:00:40,075 --> 00:00:46,405
They are entitled, and even though
they have enrolled and entitled,

10
00:00:46,405 --> 00:00:51,235
but most of them, they don't
proactively leverage or utilize them.

11
00:00:51,735 --> 00:00:55,095
The goal of this federal mandate was to.

12
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,800
Ensure organizations or Medicare
organizations reach proactively these

13
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,940
members asking them to understand
what they are entitled for, what are

14
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:15,050
pending supplemental benefits they
can utilize, and what is the duration?

15
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:22,419
So this is a mandate which was supposed
to be implemented in 2024 December.

16
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:24,209
So let's deep dive into it.

17
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:30,559
So this initiative represents a pioneering
case study in leveraging AI within the

18
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:35,269
healthcare compliance setting, a new
benchmark for efficiency and accuracy.

19
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:39,369
Its successful implementation is
POed to deliver transformative

20
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:44,049
impact, reshaping industry standards
and ensuring equitable benefit

21
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:46,929
distributions for millions of members.

22
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:54,469
So the challenge we had is the
unprecedented data demands in 2024,

23
00:01:55,429 --> 00:02:03,209
as this was mandated, where our
organization is supposed to understand

24
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:08,764
more than a hundred supplemental
benefits we support today, but currently.

25
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:14,019
More than 10 different vendors,
source systems are providing the

26
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:15,669
services to the organizations.

27
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:21,069
So how do we ensure that we gather
all the information, we filter through

28
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:24,999
the different benefits as these
are complex benefits to understand

29
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:27,689
they have their own structures.

30
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,539
So the challenge is the data.

31
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,179
How do we play around with the data?

32
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,899
Understand different
structures for these 200 plus.

33
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:38,869
2 million plus members.

34
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:43,179
So this is the highlight of like in
this project, what we have faced,

35
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:47,859
where we had around 102 supplemental
benefit, different benefits.

36
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:54,749
Each has a distinct demand and istic
categorized and standardized, and

37
00:02:54,749 --> 00:02:56,849
there are 10 different source systems.

38
00:02:57,494 --> 00:03:04,324
Integration of these systems and
understanding each system to see what

39
00:03:04,324 --> 00:03:08,194
benefit they provide, how they are
different from other source systems,

40
00:03:08,344 --> 00:03:11,914
maybe overlap between different systems.

41
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:14,464
So that's another challenge we had.

42
00:03:14,554 --> 00:03:22,054
And we had two, two plus million
members were supported using

43
00:03:22,054 --> 00:03:24,034
the Medicare organizations.

44
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:30,435
Who are involved in medical as
well as PDP or pharmacy benefits.

45
00:03:30,935 --> 00:03:36,365
So how the AI prompt help
to solve our project.

46
00:03:36,865 --> 00:03:40,225
So our strategic eruption of
prompt engineering and AI assisted

47
00:03:40,225 --> 00:03:44,395
