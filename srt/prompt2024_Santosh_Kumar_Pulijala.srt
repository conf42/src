00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:19,270
edtech and discuss the ethical
responsibilities that come with them.

6
00:00:20,209 --> 00:00:23,479
In this session, we are going
to look into the introduction

7
00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:24,849
to educational technology.

8
00:00:25,389 --> 00:00:30,809
Key technological innovations, the promise
of edtech, and all the concerns that

9
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:36,289
we have, like ethical concerns, privacy
and data protection concerns, equity and

10
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:41,509
access, transparency and accountability,
digital being and screen time concerns.

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,800
And we are going to dive deep into
responsible implementation strategies.

12
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,029
First, let's look into the
introduction to educational technology.

13
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:56,720
Educational technology, or edtech,
rapidly transforms classrooms and opens

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,440
up opportunities for more accessible,
tailored, and engaging learning.

15
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,970
It has become a powerful
tool in the modern classroom.

00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:09,940
As of 2020, this sector was
valued at nearly 90 billion.

17
00:01:10,285 --> 00:01:18,295
And is protected and is projected
to grow almost 285 billion by 2027.

18
00:01:18,685 --> 00:01:24,134
This significant growth reflects a
global shift towards digital learning

19
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:30,515
driven in part by the COVID 19 pandemic,
which made remote education a necessity.

20
00:01:30,515 --> 00:01:37,794
Over 94 percent of countries implemented
remote learning solutions with About

21
00:01:37,815 --> 00:01:43,255
60 percent adopting online platforms
at various educational levels.

22
00:01:43,615 --> 00:01:47,854
The result is a more accessible
learning experience and a promise

23
00:01:47,854 --> 00:01:50,414
of improved educational outcomes.

24
00:01:50,864 --> 00:01:55,335
However, these advancements
also pose challenges.

25
00:01:55,754 --> 00:02:01,985
Questions about how to protect students

26
00:02:01,994 --> 00:02:03,904
uphold the quality of education.

27
00:02:04,474 --> 00:02:06,835
across diverse communities.

28
00:02:07,224 --> 00:02:12,625
As we advance, establishing ethical
guidelines and governance in edtech

29
00:02:12,975 --> 00:02:17,654
becomes essential to protect the
rights and well being of students,

30
00:02:17,945 --> 00:02:20,175
parents, and educators alike.

31
00:02:20,685 --> 00:02:27,099
With this in mind, let's examine the
key technological innovations in EdTech

32
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,629

5 times increase in students math skills
by tailoring content to individual needs.

39
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:07,699
Virtual and augmented reality, which
is VR and AR, have opened immersive

40
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:13,579
learning avenues, making abstract
concepts tangible, which improves

41
00:03:13,809 --> 00:03:19,669
engagement and retention by as
much as 7 percent data analytics.

42
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,649
Often integrated into learning
management systems, enable real

43
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:28,549
time tracking of student progress,
Allowing educators to respond

44
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:30,709
swiftly to individual learning needs.

45
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:37,109
These advancements are powerful, but
we must implement them thoughtfully

46
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:39,499
to avoid potential pitfalls.

47
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:44,919
For example, AI driven systems
should be transparent and unbiased,

48
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:50,279
while VR tools must be accessible
and not overly intrusive.

49
00:03:50,809 --> 00:03:55,129
Now let's look at the broad
promise EdTech holds for learners.

50
00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:56,599
The promise of EdTech.

51
00:03:57,494 --> 00:04:00,554
The promise of educational
technology is immense.

52
00:04:00,954 --> 00:04:04,284
By leveraging ed tech,
we are moving towards.

53
00:04:04,634 --> 00:04:10,384
More personalized learning where AI
and machine learning tailor lessons to

54
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:16,034
individual student progress, allowing
them to learn at their own pace.

55
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:22,064
Immersive experiences made possible
by virtual reality and artificial

56
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:29,244
reality help bring complex ideas to
life, making learning not only more

57
00:04:29,244 --> 00:04:31,154
engaging, but also more effective.

58
00:04:31,594 --> 00:04:34,644
Data analytics are transforming teaching.

59
00:04:35,384 --> 00:04:40,214
Providing a real time insights that
enable educators to adapt their lessons

60
00:04:40,474 --> 00:04:43,224
and support each student's unique needs.

61
00:04:43,624 --> 00:04:45,544
The statistics back this up.

62
00:04:46,174 --> 00:04:53,474
Adaptive platforms can increase math
skills by almost 250 percent and

63
00:04:54,154 --> 00:05:00,154
immersive VR experiences have been
shown to improve test scores by 7%.

64
00:05:00,554 --> 00:05:04,874
Despite these benefits, the ethical
challenges we face cannot be overlooked.

65
00:05:05,294 --> 00:05:09,944
We must work to ensure this technology
is accessible, safe, and fair.

66
00:05:10,454 --> 00:05:14,744
Let's take a closer look at some
of the ethical concerns, beginning

67
00:05:14,924 --> 00:05:17,174
with privacy and data protection.

68
00:05:17,674 --> 00:05:20,394
Ethical concerns in education technology.

69
00:05:20,894 --> 00:05:24,729
While the benefits of edtech
are clear, We must also address

70
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:26,599
the ethical concerns it brings.

71
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:32,259
First and foremost, privacy and data
protection are significant concerns.

72
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:37,319
As edtech tools collect vast
amounts of data, the risk

73
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,959
associated with unauthorized
data access and breaches grow.

74
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:45,459
Equity and access are
another critical issue.

75
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:50,859
Many students, especially in low
income or rural areas, face a

76
00:05:50,869 --> 00:05:55,669
digital divide that limits their
ability to benefit from these tools.

77
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:01,249
Transparency and accountability
are essential as well, especially

78
00:06:01,249 --> 00:06:05,759
when it comes to AI driven systems
that impact students as well.

79
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:10,759
Especially when it comes to AI driven
systems that impact students evaluations.

80
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:12,229
and learning paths.

81
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:16,869
We also need to consider digital
well being as excessive screen

82
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:21,879
time can have negative effects on
students mental and physical health.

83
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:26,549
As we dive into each of these
topics, we'll discuss ways to

84
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:31,434
address these challenges and create
an edtech environment That is both

85
00:06:31,484 --> 00:06:33,914
innovative and ethically responsible.

86
00:06:34,414 --> 00:06:36,924
Now let's look into privacy
and data protection.

87
00:06:37,444 --> 00:06:41,604
Privacy and data protection are
vital components of ethical ed tech.

88
00:06:42,394 --> 00:06:45,924
Educational institutions must
comply with data protection

89
00:06:45,934 --> 00:06:48,034
regulations, such as FERPA.

90
00:06:48,494 --> 00:06:53,024
Full Form is the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act in the U.

91
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:53,284
S.

92
00:06:53,574 --> 00:06:58,704
and GDPR in Europe, General Data
Protection Regulation, which

93
00:06:58,764 --> 00:07:03,094
outlines standards for managing and
safeguarding student information.

94
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:06,729
However, compliance alone isn't enough.

95
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:11,359
EdTech tools gather a significant
amount of sensitive data, such

96
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:16,259
as academic records, attendance,
and even behavioral information.

97
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:20,449
This creates vulnerabilities,
especially in low income countries

98
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:25,529
where data protection laws may
be insufficient or non existent.

99
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,669
Cyber security threats are on the rise.

100
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:33,389
408 cyber incidents were reported in U.

101
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:33,499
S.

102
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:39,859
schools in 2020 alone, making an 18
percent increase from the previous year.

103
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:45,749
To combat these risks, schools must
invest in robust security measures

104
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:48,909
and provide clear privacy policies.

105
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:52,599
Protecting students data
isn't just about compliance.

106
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,839
It's about creating a safe digital
environment for all students.

107
00:07:56,129 --> 00:08:00,929
Where students parents and educators
can trust the technology they rely

108
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:07,459
on now Let's look into equity and
access Ensuring equitable access to

109
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:09,779
technology is essential in net tech.

110
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:16,599
The digital divide remains significant
challenge with only 25 percent of

111
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:20,989
students in low income countries have
access to digital resources, compared

112
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:23,889
to 96 percent in high income countries.

113
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:28,459
This gap means that millions
of students are left out of

114
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,869
digital learning revolution.

115
00:08:31,739 --> 00:08:35,229
Accessibility extends beyond income level.

116
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:39,949
Students with disabilities also
face barriers when a tech platform

117
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,619
lack necessary accommodations.

118
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:49,579
Furthermore, biases in AI algorithms
can reinforce existing inequalities,

119
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:51,909
necessitating careful oversight.

120
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:53,979
For instance, in the U.

121
00:08:53,979 --> 00:09:00,709
S., around 43 percent of households with
incomes under 30, 000 lack home broadband,

122
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,789
limiting their access to digital learning.

123
00:09:03,489 --> 00:09:07,749
Bridging these gaps requires a
collective effort from policymakers,

124
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:09,609
educators, and developers.

125
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:15,809
We must invest in infrastructure,
develop inclusive technologies and adopt

126
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:20,539
policies that make digital learning
resources available to every student.

127
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:24,999
Now, let's look into
transparency and accountability.

128
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:27,579
Transparency and accountability.

129
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:34,189
In AI systems, as AI systems become more
embedded in education, transparency and

130
00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:36,509
accountability must be top priorities.

131
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:43,149
For AI to be a trusted tool in education,
its decision making process need to be

132
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:47,759
explainable, especially in high stakes
scenarios like student evaluations.

133
00:09:48,729 --> 00:09:53,404
A recent study showed that 63 percent
of parents are concerned about

134
00:09:53,544 --> 00:09:58,534
algorithmic decisions in impacting
their children's academic assessments.

135
00:09:59,334 --> 00:10:05,654
The black box nature of AI, where complex
algorithms make decisions without clear

136
00:10:05,694 --> 00:10:10,504
reasoning can be a problematic leading to
issues with fairness and accountability.

137
00:10:11,434 --> 00:10:14,094
Ensuring human oversight is critical.

138
00:10:14,174 --> 00:10:20,459
In fact, 86 percent of teachers believe
AI systems need a human element to

139
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:23,559
guide decisions and address any biases.

140
00:10:24,469 --> 00:10:30,169
For example, the controversial algorithm
used in the UK for A level grading

141
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:36,219
disproportionately downgraded students
from disadvantaged backgrounds.

142
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:39,749
Establishing clear guidelines
for human oversight.

143
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:44,634
And algorithmic transparency is crucial
to build trust and safeguard the

144
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,334
integrate, integrity of AI in education.

145
00:10:48,884 --> 00:10:52,504
Now, let's look into digital
well being and screen time.

146
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:57,734
Digital being is an often overlooked
yet vital aspect of a tech.

147
00:10:58,254 --> 00:11:03,954
With increased screen time, it's essential
to balance digital and traditional

148
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:09,154
learning to protect students cognitive
development and physical health.

149
00:11:09,814 --> 00:11:15,814
Studies show that children who spend over
two hours a day on screens tend to score

150
00:11:15,914 --> 00:11:18,584
lower on language and thinking tests.

151
00:11:19,064 --> 00:11:24,424
Additionally, prolonged screen use
can lead to issues such as eye strain,

152
00:11:24,894 --> 00:11:28,014
poor posture, and mental fatigue.

153
00:11:28,874 --> 00:11:34,014
Schools that promote digital literacy
and educate students on managing

154
00:11:34,014 --> 00:11:38,434
screen time see tangible results,
including a 40 percent reduction

155
00:11:38,434 --> 00:11:40,044
in cyber bullying incidents.

156
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:45,804
To support students well being, schools
should offer mental health resources,

157
00:11:46,094 --> 00:11:51,764
limit unnecessary screen time, and
incorporate digital citizenship programs.

158
00:11:52,684 --> 00:11:58,844
Ultimately, digital literacy skills
help students navigate online risks and

159
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:04,004
misinformation, promoting a healthier
and more balanced approach to technology

160
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:06,174
use in their educational journey.

161
00:12:07,124 --> 00:12:11,244
And now let's look into responsible
implementation strategies.

162
00:12:11,804 --> 00:12:15,514
A responsible approach to ed
tech implementation involves

163
00:12:15,804 --> 00:12:17,294
several key strategies.

164
00:12:17,624 --> 00:12:19,414
Data governance is fundamental.

165
00:12:20,034 --> 00:12:25,744
Clear data policies, regular audits,
and dedicated privacy staff help

166
00:12:26,104 --> 00:12:28,274
safeguard student information.

167
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:34,324
Equity and inclusivity should guide
every decision, with investments in

168
00:12:34,374 --> 00:12:39,624
infrastructure to close the digital
divide and ensure that digital resources

169
00:12:39,784 --> 00:12:42,144
are accessible to all students.

170
00:12:42,764 --> 00:12:49,844
Transparency in AI is also very crucial,
requiring explainable algorithms and

171
00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:52,984
regular bias audits to uphold fairness.

172
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:58,354
Lastly, promoting digital well being
calls for balanced screen time,

173
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:02,394
mental health support, and digital
literacy training for students.

174
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:05,204
Each stakeholder has a role.

175
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:10,704
Policymakers must prioritize
comprehensive data privacy laws.

176
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:16,579
Educators need ongoing tech training
and an ethical approach to tool

177
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:21,439
evaluation, and developers must
adopt privacy by design principles.

178
00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:26,909
By working together, we can ensure
edtech support students learning while

179
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:28,879
upholding their rights and well being.

180
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:31,109
Okay, let me conclude this topic.

181
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:36,619

technology in education offers

182
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:42,149
incredible possibilities from
personalized learning and immersive

183
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:44,599
experiences to real time data insights.

184
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:51,579
However, that benefits come with ethical
responsibilities that cannot be ignored.

185
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:57,549
Protecting student privacy, bridging
the digital divide, ensuring transparent

186
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:02,889
AI, and promoting digital well being
are all essential steps to create

187
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:05,049
a responsible EdTech environment.

188
00:14:05,924 --> 00:14:11,314
As we continue to innovate, let's commit
to these principles, ensuring that

189
00:14:11,324 --> 00:14:17,764
technology not only enhances learning,
but does so in a way that is fair,

190
00:14:18,044 --> 00:14:21,014
safe, and accessible for all students.

191
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:26,654
By taking a proactive, ethical approach,
we can make a positive, lasting

192
00:14:26,654 --> 00:14:29,054
impact on the educational landscape.

193
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:35,209
Creating a future where technology
and human values work hand in
