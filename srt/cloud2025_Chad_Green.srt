00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,510
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:05,840
I am thrilled you are here as I present my
defense on using microservices in the ever

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,580
evolving world of software architecture.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,570
Microservices have been
both celebrated in question.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,129
In this presentation, I will discuss the
benefits of microservices, address common

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,889
critiques, and explore how they can be
effectively adapted in your organization.

7
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,575
if they even make sense for your needs.

8
00:00:23,285 --> 00:00:28,704
But before we proceed, let's examine how
microservices meteoric rise turned into a

9
00:00:28,705 --> 00:00:30,975
journey through scrutiny and skepticism.

10
00:00:31,475 --> 00:00:35,274
We kick off the journey by diving into
what I like to call the era of hype.

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,730
Spanning from about, 2014 to 2018.

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,210
During this time, microservices
were not just a new architectural

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,339
style, they were a revolution.

14
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,040
The tech world was
buzzing with excitement.

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,800
Microservices were hailed as the
silver bullet that would solve

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,799
all our software development woes.

17
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,890
Every conference agenda was packed
with talks on microservices.

18
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,340
Tech blogs and industry magazines
featured headline after headline.

19
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,619
Things like microservices, the future
of software architecture, why monoliths

20
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:12,349
are a thing of the past, and unlock
unlimited scalability with microservices.

21
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:14,219
The promise was alluring.

22
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:19,209
Break down your bulky, monolithic
applications into small, independent

23
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:23,159
services that could be developed,
deployed, and scaled autonomously.

24
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:28,279
It was like going from steering a
cumbersome cruise ship to piloting

25
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:30,129
a fleet of agile speedboats.

26
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:34,919
Companies like Netflix and Amazon
were poster children of this movement.

27
00:01:35,494 --> 00:01:39,014
They share compelling success stories
about how microservices enable

28
00:01:39,054 --> 00:01:43,594
them to innovate rapidly, deploy
hundreds of times a day, and scale

29
00:01:43,644 --> 00:01:45,384
effortlessly to meet global demand.

30
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:50,324
Developers and architects worldwide
were eager to jump on the bandwagon.

31
00:01:50,774 --> 00:01:54,355
The idea that we could overcome
the limitations of monolithic

32
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,274
architectures was exhilarating.

33
00:01:56,734 --> 00:02:02,294
It felt like we had finally found the
key to unlocking unlimited agility and

34
00:02:02,314 --> 00:02:04,204
efficiency in software development.

35
00:02:04,204 --> 00:02:08,619
Microsoft Mechanics I attended conferences
where speakers passionately declared that

36
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:10,499
microservices were not just an option.

37
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,599
They were a necessity for any organization
that wanted to stay competitive.

38
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:20,159
Phrases like infinitely scalable,
highly resilient, and built for the

39
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,859
cloud era were the mantra of the day.

40
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:26,519
Adopting microservices became
a sort of badge of honor.

41
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:30,319
Organizations proudly announced
their transition plans.

42
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:34,939
Job postings saw engineers
with microservices expertise

43
00:02:35,369 --> 00:02:36,669
as a top requirement.

44
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:42,609
It was as if not embracing microservices
meant being left behind in the

45
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:44,689
annals of outdated technology.

46
00:02:45,554 --> 00:02:49,104
But amidst this excitement,
there was often little discussion

47
00:02:49,104 --> 00:02:52,874
about the challenges that might
come from such a transformation.

48
00:02:53,494 --> 00:02:57,854
The focus was squarely on potential
benefits, with less attention paid

49
00:02:57,854 --> 00:03:01,294
to the complexities of distributed
systems, data management across

50
00:03:01,295 --> 00:03:04,944
services, or the operational overhead.

51
00:03:05,744 --> 00:03:07,834
It was a time of unbridled optimism.

52
00:03:08,164 --> 00:03:12,834
The industry was caught up in a
whirlwind of innovation, eager to

53
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:15,274
discard the old and embrace the new.

54
00:03:15,774 --> 00:03:19,544
Now, before I continue further,
let me confess that I was a skeptic

55
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:21,224
during the first part of this time.

56
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:25,524
I remember 2016, sitting in a
job interview, being asked about

57
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:26,944
my thoughts on microservices.

58
00:03:27,464 --> 00:03:30,834
Now, having extensive experience
with service oriented architecture

59
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:34,884
and large enterprises, I confidently
said, I think they're overhyped and

60
00:03:34,884 --> 00:03:37,244
this enthusiasm will fade very soon.

61
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,604
needless to say, I did not get that job.

62
00:03:40,274 --> 00:03:45,444
Ironically, in my next role, I found
myself implementing microservices because

63
00:03:45,704 --> 00:03:48,464
they were perfect for the project at hand.

64
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:52,724
Since then, I have built several
microservice based solutions.

65
00:03:53,344 --> 00:03:56,984
Through these experiences, I
quickly realized that microservices

66
00:03:56,994 --> 00:03:59,269
hold a incredible promises.

67
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:02,849
But they also introduced
significant complexities.

68
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:04,139
And it wasn't just me.

69
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:07,829
Many organizations began
sharing similar insights.

70
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:10,779
This brings us to the next
chapter of our journey.

71
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:14,689
How the initial excitement
gave way to rising skepticism.

72
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:18,424
As the industry grappled with the
practical realities of microservices.

73
00:04:18,994 --> 00:04:24,114
As the initial excitement around
microservices began to settle, a new

74
00:04:24,124 --> 00:04:27,704
phase emerged, this rising skeptic phase.

75
00:04:28,064 --> 00:04:30,704
Expanding from about 2018 to 2022.

76
00:04:31,695 --> 00:04:34,139
Now here, organizations
had eagerly jumped.

77
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,979
on microservices, on the
microservices bandwagon.

78
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,489
But they started to face
unexpected challenges.

79
00:04:40,869 --> 00:04:46,529
The promise of infinite scalability
and seamless deployments were met

80
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:50,539
with the realities of increased
complexity and operational overhead.

81
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:55,479
Implementing microservices was not as
straightforward as many had thought.

82
00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:00,039
There was issues such as
distributed, distributed systems.

83
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:04,669
Inter service communication issues
and data consistency problems.

84
00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:08,569
Developers found themselves spending
more time on managing infrastructures

85
00:05:09,429 --> 00:05:13,749
and debugging complex issues
rather than building new features.

86
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:19,369
The microservice architecture introduced
a myriad of new components service

87
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:23,929
registers, API gateways, load balancers
that required expertise and maintenance.

88
00:05:24,609 --> 00:05:27,549
Moreover, the operational
cost began to rise.

89
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,889
Running multiple services meant
increased resource consumption, from

90
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:35,089
computing power to monitoring tools.

91
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:40,879
The simplicity of deploying a monolith
gave way to the intricacies of deploying

92
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,779
and orchestrating numerous services.

93
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,839
Organizations started to question
whether the benefits outweighed the cost.

94
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:50,499
Was the shift to microservices
delivering on its promises?

95
00:05:50,974 --> 00:05:55,114
Or had we underestimated the challenges
inherent in such a transformation?

96
00:05:55,614 --> 00:05:58,564
Prominent voices in the tech community
began expressing their concerns.

97
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:03,134
Articles with titles like, the
microservice trade off, monoliths

98
00:06:03,144 --> 00:06:07,514
strike back, and the hidden cost
of microservices started appearing.

99
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:12,144
Renowned software architects
shared their experiences, pointing

100
00:06:12,144 --> 00:06:15,574
out that microservices were not
a one size fits all solution.

101
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:19,594
They emphasized that without proper
planning and deep understanding of

102
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:23,754
the domain, microservices could lead
to more problems than they solve.

103
00:06:24,254 --> 00:06:28,524
Some common critiques include,
breaking down applications into many

104
00:06:28,524 --> 00:06:32,654
services was causing unnecessary
complexities and over engineering.

105
00:06:33,614 --> 00:06:37,734
Increased, network calls leading
to performance bottlenecks.

106
00:06:38,184 --> 00:06:42,394
Ensuring data consistency across services
became a significant challenge and

107
00:06:42,394 --> 00:06:44,864
caused data management difficulties.

108
00:06:45,194 --> 00:06:49,824
And end to end testing was complex
due to numerous independent services.

109
00:06:50,324 --> 00:06:53,574
The initial enthusiasm was
giving way to prudence.

110
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:57,914
Teams realized that microservices
demanded a cultural shift,

111
00:06:58,294 --> 00:06:59,574
not just a technical one.

112
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:05,484
It required cross functional teams,
developed DevOps practices, and a strong

113
00:07:05,544 --> 00:07:07,844
emphasis on automation and monitoring.

114
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:12,114
Many began to ask, was adopting
microservices the right

115
00:07:12,124 --> 00:07:13,354
choice for our organization?

116
00:07:13,854 --> 00:07:17,724
And do we have the necessary
infrastructure and expertise

117
00:07:17,734 --> 00:07:19,604
to manage this complexity?

118
00:07:20,104 --> 00:07:23,354
This period of rising skepticism
wasn't necessarily negative.

119
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:27,894
Instead, it represented a
maturation in the industry's

120
00:07:27,934 --> 00:07:29,494
understanding of microservices.

121
00:07:29,914 --> 00:07:35,634
We moved from seeing them as a silver
bullet to recognizing them as a powerful

122
00:07:35,634 --> 00:07:38,054
tool that requires careful consideration.

123
00:07:38,864 --> 00:07:44,294
It was time for reflection and
recalibration to assess when and how

124
00:07:44,334 --> 00:07:46,124
to use microservices effectively.

125
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:53,154
Continuing our journey, we strive against
the phase that I refer to as losing faith.

126
00:07:54,024 --> 00:07:58,404
Spanning the last couple of years,
during this past, during this period,

127
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:03,234
the skepticism that had been rising
began to solidify into outright

128
00:08:03,244 --> 00:08:05,114
doubt, for many organizations.

129
00:08:05,594 --> 00:08:09,714
The challenges and complexities
encountered led some to question whether

130
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:12,014
microservices were the right path at all.

131
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:17,164
We were hearing about organizations
that had initially invested heavily

132
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:21,104
in microservices began to reassess
their architectural choices.

133
00:08:21,474 --> 00:08:26,084
For some, the operational burdens,
talent shortages, and unrealized

134
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:30,934
benefits led to decisions to scale
back or even abandon microservices

135
00:08:30,984 --> 00:08:32,404
in favor of alternate architecture.

136
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,439
Architectures.

137
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:38,399
Articles and thought piece, pieces
emerged with titles like it's

138
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,089
time to abandon microservices.

139
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,249
The microservice retrospective.

140
00:08:42,249 --> 00:08:43,059
Was it worth it?

141
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,729
And embracing the model
of the modular monolith.

142
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:50,579
Prominent tech leaders voiced
their concerns more openly.

143
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:56,039
They highlighted cases where microservices
had led to project delays, increased

144
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,019
costs, and performance issues.

145
00:08:58,689 --> 00:09:02,489
The complexity of microservices
required specialized expertise

146
00:09:02,749 --> 00:09:03,879
that was hard to find.

147
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:08,009
The industry began to acknowledge
that microservices were not

148
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:09,599
a one size fits all solution.

149
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:15,219
Without the right tools, culture, and
resources, microservices could become

150
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:17,529
more of a hindrance than a help.

151
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:23,509
Common reasons for losing faith
included overwhelming complexity due

152
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:25,499
to sheer number of services being lost.

153
00:09:25,814 --> 00:09:26,524
unmanageable.

154
00:09:27,114 --> 00:09:31,024
Teams lacked the necessary
experience in DevOps, distributed

155
00:09:31,034 --> 00:09:32,774
systems, and cloud infrastructure.

156
00:09:33,254 --> 00:09:37,354
Existing tools did not adequately
support microservice needs, and

157
00:09:37,454 --> 00:09:41,764
organization structures were not
adapted for independent services

158
00:09:41,824 --> 00:09:43,244
development and deployment.

159
00:09:43,744 --> 00:09:47,364
In some cases, organizations made
the difficult decision to revert

160
00:09:47,644 --> 00:09:52,084
to monolithic architecture or
adapt a modular monolith approach.

161
00:09:52,484 --> 00:09:57,014
They sought to regain control over
their systems, reduce complexity, and

162
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,244
focus on delivering business value.

163
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:03,064
This period is marked by a
sense of disillusionment.

164
00:10:03,464 --> 00:10:09,324
The lofty expectations set during the era
of hype had not been met for everyone.

165
00:10:09,774 --> 00:10:12,209
The pendulum has swung
from excitement to fear.

166
00:10:12,469 --> 00:10:13,559
to skepticism.

167
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:16,419
And now for some to abandon it.

168
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:21,859
Now, having traversed the highs of the
hype and the lows of the skepticism and

169
00:10:21,859 --> 00:10:26,569
the challenges that led some to lose
faith, we now stand at the brink of a

170
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:29,539
new era, the era of intelligent maturity.

171
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:35,089
This phase is about leveraging
experiences, embracing best practices,

172
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:38,859
and implementing microservices
where they make the most sense.

173
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:43,249
It is a time to use microservices,
but use them wisely.

174
00:10:43,849 --> 00:10:46,879
And only when they actually make sense.

175
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:51,189
Advancements in tooling, the improved
orchestration platforms, enhanced

176
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:54,789
monitoring solutions, and robust
security practices are contributing

177
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:57,659
to smoother microservice operations.

178
00:10:58,229 --> 00:11:02,509
Importantly, there is a deeper
understanding of when and how to

179
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:04,039
use microservices effectively.

180
00:11:04,469 --> 00:11:08,169
Organizations recognize that
microservices are not a universal

181
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:12,599
solution, but a powerful option
when applied to the right problems.

182
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:17,399
This era represents a time of
mastery and innovation where

183
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:22,239
microservices are unleashing the
power that they have been promising.

184
00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:27,239
But as we move forward, organizations
are poised to harness this full

185
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:31,089
potential microservices, driving
unprecedented innovation and

186
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:32,519
delivering exceptional value.

187
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:37,399
Now that we explored the evolution of
microservices, let's shift our focus on

188
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:42,299
how we can apply these lessons to maximize
their benefits, for our organizations.

189
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,919
Here's what we're going to cover
during the rest of this presentation.

190
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:49,539
We'll begin by comparing various
architectural styles, including

191
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:53,909
monoliths, interior architectures,
modular monoliths, and microservices,

192
00:11:54,349 --> 00:11:57,879
to understand their strengths,
weaknesses, and ideal use cases.

193
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:02,329
With that context, we'll cover the
core benefits of microservices,

194
00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:05,989
and why they are a compelling
choice for modern applications.

195
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:10,914
Following that, we'll candidly discuss
Common critiques and challenges

196
00:12:10,954 --> 00:12:14,604
associated with microservices,
providing a balanced perspective.

197
00:12:15,154 --> 00:12:20,514
Afterward, we'll explore practical
strategies and best practices to

198
00:12:20,534 --> 00:12:25,214
overcome these challenges and ensure you
can adopt microservices successfully.

199
00:12:25,714 --> 00:12:30,104
Then I reflect back on the four primary
architectural styles I introduced in

200
00:12:30,344 --> 00:12:35,904
comparing architectural styles to provide
guidance on, on how to pick the right

201
00:12:36,194 --> 00:12:38,494
architectural style for your next project.

202
00:12:38,964 --> 00:12:43,344
Finally, I will wrap up with key
takeaways and consider how you

203
00:12:43,374 --> 00:12:46,664
can apply these insights to your
own organization moving forward.

204
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:51,679
By the end of this session, you will
not only understand why microservices

205
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:56,539
still matter, but also gain practical
insights on how to leverage them

206
00:12:56,569 --> 00:13:01,649
effectively, alongside other architectural
options in your own organization.

207
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:02,959
Hey, wait a second.

208
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:06,179
We've been chatting all this
chat about microservices, and I

209
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:07,329
still haven't introduced myself.

210
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,799
My name is Chad Green.

211
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:12,509
I'm the Senior System Architect
with 35 years experience in software

212
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:13,749
development and architecture.

213
00:13:14,464 --> 00:13:17,714
throughout my career, I have had
the pleasure of working with a

214
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:22,214
variety of technologies, but my true
passion lie in microservices, event

215
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:26,184
driven architectures, serverless
computing, and API first designs.

216
00:13:26,684 --> 00:13:31,384
I have helped organizations from
nimble startups to global enterprises

217
00:13:31,664 --> 00:13:35,564
navigate the complexities of modern
software architecture, enabling

218
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:39,534
them to build scalable, resilient
systems that drive innovation.

219
00:13:39,974 --> 00:13:43,684
Outside of work, you'll often find
me in my Lego room building intricate

220
00:13:43,684 --> 00:13:45,899
Lego sets or updating my Lego city.

221
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:50,749
I find it gives me a fresh perspective
to my professional life and lets

222
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:54,329
me step away from thinking about
complicated software architectures.

223
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:57,559
Feel free to connect with
me after the presentation.

224
00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:01,269
I would love to hear your thoughts or
answer any questions you might have.

225
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:05,659
Now that you know a little bit about me,
let's jump back into our exploration.

226
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:09,819
And to truly appreciate the advantages
of microservices, it's essential

227
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:13,139
to understand how they compare
to other architectural styles.

228
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,749
So let's begin by comparing
architectural styles.

229
00:14:16,444 --> 00:14:21,184
But before, let's talk about what
we're talking about when we mean

230
00:14:21,554 --> 00:14:24,864
architectural styles in the context
of software architecture development.

231
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:29,174
An architectural style is essentially
a blueprint, a set of principles

232
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:34,344
and patterns that guide how we
structure our software systems.

233
00:14:34,844 --> 00:14:39,584
It shapes how components interact,
how data flows, and how the system

234
00:14:39,594 --> 00:14:41,294
scales and evolves over time.

235
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:45,739
Choosing the right architectural
style is crucial because it

236
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,879
influences several key aspects.

237
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:50,989
How well can the system
handle increased load?

238
00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:54,989
How easily can the system
be updated or modified?

239
00:14:55,469 --> 00:14:59,399
How effectively can your
team develop and deploy code?

240
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:03,769
It impacts everything from
development speed to systems ability

241
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,299
to adapt to future requirements.

242
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:10,269
In our discussions today, we'll be
exploring four prominent architectural

243
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:16,679
styles, monoliths, n tier architectures,
microservices, and modular monoliths.

244
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:21,449
By understanding the strength and
weakness of each, we'll better, we will

245
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:26,969
be better equipped to make informed
decisions about which style aligns best

246
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:28,739
with our organizational needs and goals.

247
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:31,949
First up, we have the classic
monolithic architecture.

248
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:36,239
A monolith is essentially a single
unified application where all the

249
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:40,399
components are interconnected and
interdependent within one code base.

250
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,809
Let's talk about the
advantages with this approach.

251
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:48,339
Monoliths are often simpler to
develop and deploy, especially

252
00:15:48,349 --> 00:15:49,949
for small teams or projects.

253
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:55,599
Internal calls within the application are
faster than calls over a network, server.

254
00:15:56,144 --> 00:15:58,184
over a network between services.

255
00:15:59,104 --> 00:16:03,564
With all the code in one place, it
is straightforward to trace through

256
00:16:03,564 --> 00:16:06,164
the code and find and fix issues.

257
00:16:06,804 --> 00:16:09,584
However, monoliths come
with significant challenges.

258
00:16:10,574 --> 00:16:15,494
Scaling a monolith means replicating
the entire application, even if only

259
00:16:15,504 --> 00:16:17,204
one part needs additional resources.

260
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:22,584
A small change requires reapplying the
entire application, which can slow down

261
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:25,074
the release cycle and increase risk.

262
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:30,884
As code base, as your code base grows,
it becomes more complex and harder for

263
00:16:30,884 --> 00:16:33,354
developers to understand and modify.

264
00:16:34,354 --> 00:16:38,984
And making significant changes
or adapting new technologies can

265
00:16:38,994 --> 00:16:43,084
lead, can be challenging without
affecting the entire system.

266
00:16:43,584 --> 00:16:46,434
Think of a monolith as
a big block of marble.

267
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:51,679
It's solid and sturdy, but if you need to
change, if you need to make a change, you

268
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,619
have to chisel away at the whole block,
which can be time consuming and risky.

269
00:16:57,479 --> 00:17:02,009
Monolithic architectures can work
well for small applications or when

270
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,689
you need to go to market quickly.

271
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,129
However, as your application
and team grows, the monolith

272
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:12,669
can become a bottleneck, slowing
down development and deployment.

273
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:18,209
Understanding the monolith strengths and
weaknesses help us appreciate why other

274
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:22,869
architectural styles, like microservices,
have emerged to address these challenges.

275
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:27,929
Next, let's explore n tier architecture,
also known as layered architecture.

276
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:32,879
In an n tier architecture, the application
is divided into logical layers or tiers,

277
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:35,199
each with distinct responsibilities.

278
00:17:35,739 --> 00:17:39,229
Typically, layers like the presentation
layer handling the user interface.

279
00:17:39,644 --> 00:17:43,214
The business logic layer, where
the core functionality resides.

280
00:17:43,404 --> 00:17:47,444
And the data access layer,
managing transactions, or

281
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,164
interactions, with the database.

282
00:17:49,914 --> 00:17:52,884
This separation brings several advantages.

283
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:56,754
Each layer is focused on a
specific task, making the system

284
00:17:56,754 --> 00:17:59,074
more organized and maintainable.

285
00:17:59,794 --> 00:18:04,644
Layers can be reused across different
applications, saving development

286
00:18:04,674 --> 00:18:06,724
time, saving development time.

287
00:18:07,224 --> 00:18:13,684
Teams can specialize in individual layers,
improving efficiency and expertise.

288
00:18:14,674 --> 00:18:18,814
However, n tier architectures
also present some challenges.

289
00:18:19,624 --> 00:18:24,564
Layers are often closely connected, so
changes in one layer can impact others.

290
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:26,999
Making the system less flexible.

291
00:18:27,769 --> 00:18:32,689
Scalability typically happens
at the application level, not

292
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:34,599
at the individual layer level.

293
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:36,659
Limiting the scalability options.

294
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:41,639
And data likely is passing through
multiple layers, which can introduce

295
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:43,389
latency and affect performance.

296
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:46,799
You can think of NT architecture
like a layered cake.

297
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:50,439
Each layer depends on
one, on the one below it.

298
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:52,849
And together, they create the whole cake.

299
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:53,559
What?

300
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:58,359
If there's an issue within one
layer, it can affect the entire cake.

301
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:04,039
N tier architecture often offers
more structure than a monolith,

302
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:07,189
bringing organization and clarity.

303
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:11,599
However, it can still face challenges
with scalability and agility,

304
00:19:11,979 --> 00:19:15,659
especially in the environments
where requirements change rapidly.

305
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:20,774
Understanding NTR architecture
helps us see how software design

306
00:19:20,844 --> 00:19:26,044
evolved to address the limitations
of monoliths, leading us closer to

307
00:19:26,054 --> 00:19:28,064
architectures like microservices.

308
00:19:28,564 --> 00:19:28,784
Now.

309
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:33,154
Let's dive into microservices,
the architectural style, at

310
00:19:33,154 --> 00:19:34,114
the heart of our discussion.

311
00:19:34,664 --> 00:19:38,664
In a microservice architecture, an
application is composed of a collection

312
00:19:38,664 --> 00:19:40,494
of small, independent services.

313
00:19:41,084 --> 00:19:45,285
Each service focuses on a
specific, business capability

314
00:19:45,544 --> 00:19:46,805
and operates autonomously.

315
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:53,135
These services communicate over well
defined APIs, often using protocols like

316
00:19:53,145 --> 00:19:57,035
HTTP, REST, gRPC, or messaging systems.

317
00:19:57,964 --> 00:20:00,405
Let's explore the
advantages of microservices.

318
00:20:01,185 --> 00:20:03,545
Now, each service can
be scaled independently.

319
00:20:03,895 --> 00:20:09,564
If a particular service experiences high
load, you can allocate more resources to

320
00:20:09,564 --> 00:20:11,814
it without scaling the entire application.

321
00:20:12,815 --> 00:20:16,145
Teams have the freedom to choose
the most scalable technology or

322
00:20:16,145 --> 00:20:18,395
programming language for their language.

323
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:23,245
Services can be updated, deployed,
and rolled back individually,

324
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:27,755
which accelerates development
cycles and reduces risk.

325
00:20:28,065 --> 00:20:31,965
And if one service fails, it doesn't
necessarily bring down the entire system.

326
00:20:32,735 --> 00:20:35,905
This improves overall system resilience.

327
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:38,855
Of course, now, there are some challenges.

328
00:20:39,355 --> 00:20:43,265
To include, managing numerous
services requires a sophisticated

329
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:48,105
infrastructure and robust DevOps
practices, including containerization,

330
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:49,564
orchestration, and monitoring.

331
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:53,564
Dealing with network latency,
load balancing, and service

332
00:20:53,565 --> 00:20:55,085
discovery adds complexity.

333
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:59,265
Inter service communication can fail
due to network issues, requiring

334
00:20:59,265 --> 00:21:02,594
strategies for retries and fallbacks.

335
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,385
Ensuring consistency across networks.

336
00:21:05,885 --> 00:21:07,185
Services is complex.

337
00:21:07,675 --> 00:21:11,335
Transactions that span multiple
services are harder to implement,

338
00:21:11,615 --> 00:21:17,345
often requiring eventual consistency
and compensatory mechanisms.

339
00:21:18,095 --> 00:21:21,945
And testing individual services
is straightforward, but end to end

340
00:21:21,945 --> 00:21:26,695
testing becomes more complicated due
to the interactions between services.

341
00:21:27,195 --> 00:21:29,665
You can think of microservices
as a fleet of small boats

342
00:21:29,685 --> 00:21:31,545
instead of a single large ship.

343
00:21:31,965 --> 00:21:35,635
Each boat operates independently
and can navigate its own path.

344
00:21:36,115 --> 00:21:39,005
This provides greater
flexibility and agility.

345
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:44,355
But coordinating the fleet requires
effort and sophisticated communication.

346
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:48,785
Microservices are powerful for
large, complex applications that

347
00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:50,715
need to scale and evolve rapidly.

348
00:21:51,165 --> 00:21:54,634
They enable organizations
to innovate faster and adapt

349
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:56,285
to changing business needs.

350
00:21:56,925 --> 00:22:00,585
However, they demand a mature
organizational culture and

351
00:22:00,644 --> 00:22:04,965
technical infrastructure, including
automation, continuous integration

352
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:09,555
and deployment, such as CICD,
and comprehensive monitoring.

353
00:22:10,055 --> 00:22:13,845
Understanding both the benefits
and challenges of microservices is

354
00:22:13,845 --> 00:22:18,105
crucial to making informed decisions
about whether the architectural

355
00:22:18,105 --> 00:22:20,165
style fits your organization's needs.

356
00:22:21,135 --> 00:22:25,205
Now finally, let's explore modular
monoliths, an architectural style

357
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:28,315
that offers a middle ground between
monoliths and microservices.

358
00:22:29,135 --> 00:22:33,995
In a monolithic monolith, in a
modular monolith, We have a single

359
00:22:33,995 --> 00:22:37,945
application that is divided into
distinct independent modules.

360
00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:42,315
Each module encapsulates specific
functionality and maintains

361
00:22:42,345 --> 00:22:47,095
strict boundaries, communicating
internally within the application.

362
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:48,864
So advantages?

363
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:52,675
first off, clear module boundaries
make the code base easier

364
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:53,905
to understand and maintain.

365
00:22:54,395 --> 00:22:57,795
Developers can focus on
specific modules without wading

366
00:22:57,795 --> 00:22:59,145
through the entire code base.

367
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:04,110
Since all modules run within
the same application process,

368
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:08,440
intermodular communication is
fast, avoiding the network latency

369
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,990
associated with microservices.

370
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:15,140
You deploy a single application, which
simplifies the deployment process compared

371
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,020
to managing numerous microservices.

372
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:23,340
And a modular monolith can serve as a
stepping stone, towards microservices.

373
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,650
If needed, modules can be
extracted into services over time.

374
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,110
Of course, there are
challenges to consider.

375
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,990
Scaling is still done at
the application level.

376
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,910
If one module requires more resources,
you have to scale the entire application.

377
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:42,560
Changes in one module
necessitate redeploying the whole

378
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,050
application, which can impact
deployment, frequency, and risk.

379
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,630
Without strict discipline, module
boundaries can erode over time, leading

380
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,250
to tight coupling between modules.

381
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:58,120
And a failure in one module can
still affect the entire application,

382
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,180
since all modules share the same
processes, same process space.

383
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,470
So we can think of a module monolith
like a well organized toolbox.

384
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:14,220
Everything, is in one place, but each
tool or module has its own compartment.

385
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,130
it's organized and efficient,
but you have to still, you still

386
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,620
have to carry the entire toolbox.

387
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:24,590
Even if you only need one tool, modular
monoliths offer a balanced approach.

388
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,810
They, They bring structure and
organization to your code base without

389
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,800
the operational overhead of microservices.

390
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,840
For many applications, especially those
not requiring extreme scalability or

391
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,330
independent scaling of components,
a modular monolith can provide the

392
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,850
necessary flexibility and maintainability.

393
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,740
Understanding modular monoliths
helps us see that there's more

394
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,830
than one way to achieve separation
of concerns and scalability.

395
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:58,970
The best architectural choice depends on
your project's specific context and needs.

396
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:03,330
Having explored the spectrum of
architectural styles, from the simplicity

397
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:06,600
of monoliths to the organization
of interior architectures, the

398
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,830
flexibility of microservices, and the
balance of modular monoliths, you've

399
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:16,375
gained a comprehensive understanding
Of their strengths and challenges.

400
00:25:16,785 --> 00:25:22,555
Each style offers a unique advantage,
but as we have seen, they also come

401
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:23,965
with their own set of trade offs.

402
00:25:24,465 --> 00:25:29,464
This begs the question, what makes
microservices stand out as a compelling

403
00:25:29,474 --> 00:25:31,294
choice for modern applications?

404
00:25:31,794 --> 00:25:34,994
Now let's dive into the core
benefits of microservices and

405
00:25:35,024 --> 00:25:39,504
understand why this architectural
style has become a cornerstone

406
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:41,634
for modern scalable applications.

407
00:25:42,184 --> 00:25:45,954
We'll explore how microservices
can transform the way we build,

408
00:25:46,034 --> 00:25:50,764
deploy, and manage software, offering
unparalleled advantages in scalability,

409
00:25:51,004 --> 00:25:52,774
flexibility, and resilience.

410
00:25:53,434 --> 00:25:58,044
By the end of this section, you will see
how microservices address the challenges

411
00:25:58,044 --> 00:26:03,004
we have discussed and why they are a
powerful tool in the Architects Toolkit.

412
00:26:03,504 --> 00:26:07,224
One of the most significant benefits
of microservices is scalability.

413
00:26:08,084 --> 00:26:12,274
In a microservice architecture,
each service is a separate component

414
00:26:12,544 --> 00:26:16,884
that can be scaled independently
based upon its specific demands.

415
00:26:17,594 --> 00:26:22,314
This means if one service experiences
increased load, say, like the payment

416
00:26:22,324 --> 00:26:27,334
processing service during holiday,
shopping rush, we can allocate more

417
00:26:27,334 --> 00:26:31,814
resources to just that service without
scaling the entire application.

418
00:26:32,814 --> 00:26:37,734
This approach optimizes resource
utilization and cost, ensuring that

419
00:26:37,734 --> 00:26:41,424
we're not over provisioning resources
for services that don't need them.

420
00:26:41,924 --> 00:26:44,574
Additionally, microservices
support elasticity.

421
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:48,819
With modern cloud, platforms
and orchestration tools like

422
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:53,319
Kubernetes, Kubernetes services
can be scaled automatically in

423
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,129
response to traffic patterns.

424
00:26:55,729 --> 00:27:00,239
This approach allows applications to
handle varying workloads seamlessly,

425
00:27:00,389 --> 00:27:04,299
scaling up during peak demands,
or scaling up during peak times

426
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:09,379
and down during lulls, which is
both, efficient and cost effective.

427
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:13,679
To illustrate, consider an e commerce
platform during Black Friday.

428
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:19,149
The product catalog and checkout services
can scale out to meet the surge in demand,

429
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:24,759
ensuring smooth user experiences without
overtaxing the other parts of the system.

430
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:29,409
In essence, microservices enable
us to build applications that are

431
00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:34,119
flexible and responsive, capable
of growing with our user base

432
00:27:34,329 --> 00:27:36,489
and adapting to changing demands.

433
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:41,409
Another crucial benefit of
microservices is fault tolerance.

434
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:46,079
With microservices, applications are
composed of multiple independent services.

435
00:27:46,889 --> 00:27:52,199
This service isolation means that if one
service fails, it doesn't necessarily

436
00:27:52,209 --> 00:27:53,809
bring down the entire application.

437
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:59,159
For example, if the recommendation
service on a streaming platform

438
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:03,419
encounters an issue, users can
still browse and watch content.

439
00:28:03,699 --> 00:28:04,899
The failure is contained.

440
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:10,609
This isolation reduces the risk of
systematic failures and enhances

441
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:15,209
overall system scalability, leading
to more resilient applications.

442
00:28:15,979 --> 00:28:20,289
To further strengthen fault tolerance, we
implement various resilience strategies.

443
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:25,379
These include retry policies to handle
transient errors, circuit breakers to

444
00:28:25,379 --> 00:28:30,779
prevent repeated attempts to failing
services, and fallback mechanisms

445
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,939
to provide default responses.

446
00:28:33,784 --> 00:28:39,744
We also use timeouts to prevent services
from waiting indefinitely for a response.

447
00:28:40,104 --> 00:28:42,604
A design for graceful degradation.

448
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:47,474
Ensuring the applications can continue
to function in a limited capacity

449
00:28:48,104 --> 00:28:50,364
if certain services are unavailable.

450
00:28:51,044 --> 00:28:54,314
By incorporating these strategies,
microservices can withstand the

451
00:28:54,314 --> 00:28:58,514
failures and continue to provide
essential functionality to users.

452
00:28:59,224 --> 00:29:02,944
This fault tolerance is essential
for applications where uptime

453
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:04,724
and reliability are critical.

454
00:29:05,224 --> 00:29:10,504
Next, let's explore how microservices
enable Independent deployments, a game

455
00:29:10,504 --> 00:29:12,584
changer for modern development practices.

456
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:17,444
In a microservice architecture, each
service is a separate deployable unit.

457
00:29:17,984 --> 00:29:21,734
This means teams can update and
deploy their services independently

458
00:29:21,874 --> 00:29:26,234
without needing to coordinate with
other teams or wait for a synchronized

459
00:29:26,244 --> 00:29:28,614
release for the entire application.

460
00:29:29,444 --> 00:29:32,624
This capability leads to
faster release cycles, updates.

461
00:29:33,089 --> 00:29:36,929
rather, whether they're for new
features or bug fixes can be

462
00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:41,169
delivered to users more quickly,
providing a comprehensive advantage

463
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:43,439
and improving customer satisfaction.

464
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:47,979
Moreover, reduced deployment
risk is a significant benefit.

465
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:52,749
Deploying smaller incremental
changes lower the likelihood of

466
00:29:52,769 --> 00:29:54,929
introducing system wide issues.

467
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:59,419
If there's a problem with a deployment,
it's easier to roll back and fix.

468
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:03,189
without impacting the entire application.

469
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:06,969
Additionally, microservices
offer flexibility in scheduling.

470
00:30:07,749 --> 00:30:10,039
Teams can deploy when they are ready.

471
00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:15,079
aligning releases with business
priorities and market demands.

472
00:30:15,979 --> 00:30:20,559
Without being tied to lengthy release
cycles or waiting for other teams

473
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,749
to complete their work by enabling
independent deployments, microservices

474
00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:30,039
support more agile and responsive
deployments practices, aligning

475
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:34,079
perfectly with modern day DevOps
and continuous delivery approaches.

476
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:39,629
Another core benefit of microservices is
team autonomy, empowering teams to work

477
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:42,389
effectively, efficiently and innovatively.

478
00:30:42,964 --> 00:30:46,554
In a microservices architecture,
we organize around autonomous

479
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:47,754
cross functional teams.

480
00:30:48,294 --> 00:30:53,334
Each team owns the entire life cycle
of their service, from development

481
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:55,524
and testing to deployment operations.

482
00:30:56,194 --> 00:31:00,394
This ownership encourages
accountability and fosters a strong

483
00:31:00,394 --> 00:31:02,504
sense of pride and responsibility.

484
00:31:03,004 --> 00:31:05,234
This structure enables
parallel development.

485
00:31:05,734 --> 00:31:08,594
Multiple teams can work
on different systems.

486
00:31:09,074 --> 00:31:13,584
or different services at the same time
without stepping on each other's toes.

487
00:31:14,244 --> 00:31:17,594
This concurrency accelerates
development and fosters innovation

488
00:31:17,914 --> 00:31:20,584
as teams can progress independently.

489
00:31:21,244 --> 00:31:24,824
Additionally, microservices can
facilitate faster decision making.

490
00:31:25,449 --> 00:31:30,219
Teams can make techno technology and
implementation choices that best fit

491
00:31:30,249 --> 00:31:35,549
their services need without waiting
for the company wide consensus or being

492
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:38,489
constrained by a single technology stack.

493
00:31:38,989 --> 00:31:43,230
By promoting team autonomy,
microservices reduce dependencies

494
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,690
and bottlenecks between teams,
leading to increased productivity

495
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,110
and a more agile organization.

496
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:56,440
This empowerment not only accelerates
development, but also enhances

497
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,720
team morale and job satisfaction.

498
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,760
Now let's explore how microservices
offer flexibility in technology choices,

499
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:09,709
empowering teams to select the best tools
and technologies for their specific needs.

500
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:13,340
First off, microservices
enable polyglot programming.

501
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,313
Since each microservice is a
separate entity, teams can choose

502
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:23,824
to, the most appropriate technology
stack by pro, by it, be it

503
00:32:23,824 --> 00:32:27,543
programming languages, frameworks,
or databases for their service.

504
00:32:28,183 --> 00:32:32,273
This means that one service might be
written in Java, another in Python,

505
00:32:32,273 --> 00:32:36,893
and js, each optimized for its purpose.

506
00:32:37,353 --> 00:32:40,373
This flexibility allows
teams to leverage strengths.

507
00:32:40,868 --> 00:32:45,558
of different technologies, optimizing
performance and efficiency for

508
00:32:45,598 --> 00:32:48,088
each service's unique requirements.

509
00:32:48,858 --> 00:32:53,328
Second, microservices in, foster
innovation and experimentation.

510
00:32:54,318 --> 00:32:58,568
Teams are encouraged to adapt,
to new and emerging technologies.

511
00:32:59,068 --> 00:33:02,568
Where they make the most sense,
experimenting without risking the

512
00:33:02,568 --> 00:33:04,328
stability of the entire system.

513
00:33:05,078 --> 00:33:10,758
This facilitates continuous innovation
as teams can implement cutting edge

514
00:33:11,018 --> 00:33:16,958
solutions in their services, driving the
overall advancements of the application.

515
00:33:17,838 --> 00:33:22,708
Third, microservices
reduce technology lock in.

516
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:27,038
By avoiding a monolithic technology
stack for the entire application,

517
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:32,568
organizations minimize dependencies on
a single technology vendor or platform.

518
00:33:33,308 --> 00:33:37,558
It is easier to replace or upgrade
individual services as technologies

519
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:41,818
evolve, enhancing the system's
longevity and adaptability.

520
00:33:42,818 --> 00:33:47,498
This means your applications can stay
current with technological advances

521
00:33:47,678 --> 00:33:49,878
without requiring a complete overhaul.

522
00:33:50,693 --> 00:33:54,823
Overall, the flexibility in technology
choices provided by microservices

523
00:33:55,103 --> 00:33:59,843
not only optimizes each services,
each service, but also empowers

524
00:34:00,463 --> 00:34:05,633
teams to innovate and adapt swiftly
in the ever changing tech landscape.

525
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:11,225
Finally, for now, let's, we have
how microservices enable alignment

526
00:34:11,225 --> 00:34:16,235
with business goals, enhancing
organizational agility and effectiveness.

527
00:34:16,735 --> 00:34:22,085
First, microservices support organization,
organizing around business capabilities.

528
00:34:22,805 --> 00:34:27,625
In this model, each microservice
is designed to handle a specific

529
00:34:27,675 --> 00:34:29,375
business function or domain.

530
00:34:29,915 --> 00:34:34,485
For example, in an e commerce
platform, separate services might

531
00:34:34,665 --> 00:34:38,515
handle inventory management, payment
processing, and customer reviews.

532
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:43,440
By structuring services this way,
we can enhance collaboration between

533
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,420
development teams and business units.

534
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:52,290
Teams have a clear understanding of
their, of how their work directly supports

535
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:57,550
business objectives, fostering a more
integrated and purpose driven approach.

536
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,520
Next, we have autonomous
cross functional teams.

537
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:06,670
These teams comprise of the necessary
skills developers, of developers,

538
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:12,870
testers, operations, to develop and
operate their service end to end.

539
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:17,660
This promotes ownership and
accountability, as teams are fully

540
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:23,770
responsible for their services success
from conception to deployment and beyond.

541
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:28,390
This structure improves
responsiveness to business needs.

542
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:35,530
Teams can quickly implement changes or
features in their services, aligning

543
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:39,170
development closely with business
priorities and customer feedback.

544
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:44,520
Finally, microservices
enhances business agility.

545
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:50,160
By aligning organizations and teams
with businesses, Business capabilities.

546
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,820
Organizations can accelerate the
delivery of new features that are

547
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,490
more impactful to the business.

548
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:01,180
Microservices enable rapid
adoption to market changes.

549
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:06,670
If a new organization or new opportunity
arises or a competitor introduces a

550
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:10,390
feature, teams can respond swiftly
without being hindered by the

551
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,600
complexities of a monolithic system.

552
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:18,350
The agility, reduces time to market
for innovations, giving organizations

553
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:23,530
a competitive edge and ability to meet
customer expectations more effectively.

554
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:28,860
In essence, microservice bridge the
gap between technology and businesses.

555
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,380
Encourage ensuring that
the technological efforts.

556
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:38,380
Are directly contributing to business
goals and enabling organizations to

557
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,890
thrive in a dynamic market environment.

558
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:47,620
So as we have explored, the core benefits
of microservices are scalability, fault

559
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:53,120
tolerance, independent deployments,
team autonomy, flexibility in technology

560
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,340
choices and alignment with business goals.

561
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:59,640
We have showcased their
transformative potential.

562
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:05,500
These advantages enable organizations to
build resilient, agile, and innovative

563
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:10,350
systems that can adapt to changing
demands and drive business successes.

564
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:15,100
However, like any architectural
style, microservices come with

565
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,860
their own set of challenges.

566
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:23,030
It's important to acknowledge that while
the rewards can be substantial, the

567
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,900
journey isn't always straightforward.

568
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,640
In this next section, I'm going
to address several of the common

569
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,200
critiques of microservices.

570
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,130
While there are many critiques,
in the interest of time, I'm going

571
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:37,300
to focus on the top five that
most organizations encounter.

572
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,030
As we look into these critiques,
you'll notice common themes that

573
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:45,610
highlight the inherent complexities
of implementing microservices.

574
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:50,650
These critiques resonate strongly with
me because I have seen how overlooking

575
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,090
these challenges can lead to unsuccessful
microservice implementations.

576
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:00,240
By understanding these challenges up
front, you will be better equipped

577
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,740
to determine if microservices
align with your architectural

578
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,810
needs and organizational readiness.

579
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,370
Maybe there's too much
complexity in the implementation.

580
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,590
To make it, feel worth the effort.

581
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,360
Ultimately, by understanding
these challenges, you'll be

582
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,350
better prepared to navigate the
journey and reap the substantial

583
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,870
rewards of Microsoft can offer.

584
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,410
Much like a journey through
uncharted territory.

585
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:30,300
Microservices offer a great reward,
but also present obstacles that

586
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,980
must be navigated carefully.

587
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,730
microservices increases
operational overhead.

588
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,610
There is the added complexity in
deployment, monitoring, and maintenance

589
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,760
compared to monolithic architecture.

590
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,810
first off, the critiques
are very much correct.

591
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,940
Microservices do add
operational complexity.

592
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,715
This complexity stems from the need
to orchestrate Multiple services,

593
00:38:52,105 --> 00:38:56,765
each potentially with his own set of
dependencies and resource requirements.

594
00:38:57,295 --> 00:39:01,425
It requires robust infrastructure
and tooling to handle aspects like

595
00:39:01,635 --> 00:39:05,525
service discovery, load balancing,
scaling and fault tolerance.

596
00:39:05,965 --> 00:39:10,035
To adjust these challenges, various
approaches and tools are available

597
00:39:10,235 --> 00:39:12,145
across different cloud platforms.

598
00:39:13,045 --> 00:39:16,135
For container organization,
Kubernetes is the way to go.

599
00:39:16,635 --> 00:39:21,765
It's a powerful platform that can
handle large scale deployments and

600
00:39:21,795 --> 00:39:23,595
offers extensive customization.

601
00:39:24,235 --> 00:39:28,200
Services like Azure Kubernetes
Service, better known as AKS.

602
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:32,610
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes
Service, better known as EKS.

603
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,360
And Google Kubernetes Service,
sometimes known as GKE, provides managed

604
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,560
Kubernetes clusters in the cloud.

605
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:45,610
These services offer managed Kubernetes
environments for deploying and

606
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:47,670
scaling containerized applications.

607
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:52,710
For monitoring and logging, tools
like Prometheus, which excels at

608
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,260
metrics collection, and the Elk Stack.

609
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:02,790
which includes Elasticsearch,
Logstash, and Kibana are ideal for

610
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:05,320
logging, aggregation, and analysis.

611
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:10,390
They offer robust solutions to tracking
performance metrics and analyzing

612
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:12,600
logs across multiple services.

613
00:40:13,295 --> 00:40:16,815
However, in my experience, especially
when working with organizations

614
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:20,405
that have standardized Microsoft
technologies and Azure services, or

615
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:24,365
the other clouds and their compatible
technologies, I have found that

616
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:29,795
leveraging native tools provided
by the cloud platforms can greatly

617
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:31,915
simplify organizational complexity.

618
00:40:32,415 --> 00:40:36,315
Instead of managing kubernetes
clusters ourselves, we have

619
00:40:36,315 --> 00:40:40,065
utilized Azure Container Apps, a
serverless container hosting service.

620
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:44,875
It abstracts away the underlying
infrastructure, allowing us to deploy and

621
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:49,930
run containerized applications without the
overhead of managing Kubernetes directly.

622
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:55,090
This approach, reduces operational
burden as Azure handles the

623
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:58,910
orchestration, scaling, and maintenance
of the underlying resources.

624
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:03,220
It lets us focus on developing
our services rather than

625
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,400
managing infrastructure.

626
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:10,345
Similarly, services like AWS Fargate
and Google Cloud Run offer serverless

627
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:15,835
container platforms providing similar
benefits on their respective platforms.

628
00:41:16,825 --> 00:41:20,625
Additionally, we have turned to
serverless offerings like Azure

629
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:26,355
Functions, AWS Lambdas, and Google
Cloud Functions to enable us to run

630
00:41:27,345 --> 00:41:32,445
code in response to events without
provisioning or managing servers.

631
00:41:33,245 --> 00:41:37,885
This approach abstracts away much of
the infrastructure management, allowing

632
00:41:37,885 --> 00:41:42,775
development teams to focus on writing
code that delivers business value.

633
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:47,830
Azure Functions allow us to deploy
individual functions that can

634
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:53,190
scale independently and respond to
specific triggers, making them ideal

635
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,240
for event driven architectures.

636
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,630
For monitoring logging, I have found that
Azure Monitor with Application Insights

637
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:05,065
and Log Analytic Workspaces provide
comprehensive insights into the health

638
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,645
and performance of our applications.

639
00:42:07,405 --> 00:42:13,305
This tight integration within the Azure
ecosystem simplifies setup and management.

640
00:42:14,175 --> 00:42:19,615
Other cloud providers offer similar
integration tools, such as AWS CloudWatch

641
00:42:19,615 --> 00:42:22,605
and Google's Cloud Operations Suite.

642
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:26,760
other, I'm sorry, automation
and CD pipelines are essential

643
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:31,910
across all platforms to manage
operational complexity, effectively.

644
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:38,750
Tools like Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions
have been invaluable in automating our

645
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,980
build, test, and deployment processes.

646
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:48,160
Likewise, AWS CodePipeline and Google
Cloud Build provide robust CICD

647
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,240
capabilities on their platforms.

648
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:55,720
By leveraging these serverless
offerings, monitoring tools, and

649
00:42:55,750 --> 00:43:00,490
automation platforms, have been able
to mitigate much of the operational

650
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:02,970
complexity associated with microservices.

651
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:07,060
In conclusion, while microservices
introduce operational complexity,

652
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:12,010
selecting the right tools and platforms
can align with your organizational

653
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:17,726
needs, and, simplify management,
enabling you to fully leverage

654
00:43:17,726 --> 00:43:19,870
the benefits of microservices.

655
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:25,740
So whether you're using Azure, AWS,
GCP, or another platform, it's important

656
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,260
to evaluate the services they offer.

657
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:34,370
Like serverless functions, container
platforms and logging solutions to reduce

658
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,090
overhead and streamline operations.

659
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:41,560
Another significant, critique
of microservices revolve

660
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,790
around the challenges inherent
in distributed systems.

661
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:50,330
Breaking an application into multiple
services introduces complexity

662
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:54,650
in how these services communicate
and maintain data consistency.

663
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:59,360
Firstly, let's discuss network,
the network complexity.

664
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:03,660
Some of the issues we have, have
within microservices include

665
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:09,110
handling network latency and
ensuring reliable communication.

666
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:11,490
between, services can be complex.

667
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:16,110
Inner service communication adds
overhead, and network issues

668
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:18,600
can lead to unexpected failures.

669
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:23,500
We also need to manage load
balancing to distribute requests

670
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,170
effectively across instances.

671
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,460
Secondly, there is the issue
of data consistency to include.

672
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:36,220
Ensuring data integrity across multiple
services is more challenging than with

673
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,064
than with, than within a monolith.

674
00:44:40,854 --> 00:44:45,404
Managing transactions in a distributed
environment can be difficult, as

675
00:44:45,404 --> 00:44:49,704
traditional ACID transactions do
not easily extend across services.

676
00:44:50,244 --> 00:44:54,544
This can lead to data anomalies and
conflicts if not properly handled.

677
00:44:55,324 --> 00:44:59,704
To address these challenges, there
are several strategies we can employ.

678
00:45:00,204 --> 00:45:04,214
One effective approach is to is
using asynchronous communication.

679
00:45:04,794 --> 00:45:08,774
By leveraging messaging queues and
adopting event driven architecture,

680
00:45:09,274 --> 00:45:11,324
we can decouple services.

681
00:45:11,954 --> 00:45:15,344
This reduces dependency on the
immediate availability of other

682
00:45:15,344 --> 00:45:17,354
services, improving resilience.

683
00:45:17,354 --> 00:45:24,784
Services communicate by sending and
receiving messages asynchronously,

684
00:45:25,024 --> 00:45:29,384
which can help us manage network
latency and improve fault tolerance.

685
00:45:29,934 --> 00:45:33,584
In my experience, focusing on
serverless and event driven design,

686
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:38,824
such as Azure Functions and Azure
Service Bus, provide a robust way to

687
00:45:38,864 --> 00:45:40,574
implement asynchronous communication.

688
00:45:41,449 --> 00:45:45,349
These services enable us to build
reactive systems that respond to

689
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:49,929
events that as they occur without
tight coupling between services.

690
00:45:50,429 --> 00:45:53,839
Implementing retry policies and
circuit breakers is also crucial.

691
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:59,279
Retry policies allow services
to handle transient failures by

692
00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:01,599
retrying operations after a delay.

693
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:06,689
Circuit breakers help prevent
cascading failures by stopping,

694
00:46:07,029 --> 00:46:08,239
attempts to communicate.

695
00:46:08,674 --> 00:46:11,744
with a failed service
after repeated failures.

696
00:46:12,534 --> 00:46:15,844
These patterns improve system
scalability and resilience.

697
00:46:16,344 --> 00:46:19,814
Adopting eventual consistency
models is another strategy.

698
00:46:20,314 --> 00:46:24,474
In distributed systems, it is
often acceptable for data to be

699
00:46:24,474 --> 00:46:28,314
temporarily inconsistent to achieve
better scalability performance.

700
00:46:28,814 --> 00:46:33,774
Implementing patterns like event
sourcing and CQRS, or Command Query

701
00:46:33,774 --> 00:46:39,014
Responsibility Segregation, can help you
manage data consistency across services.

702
00:46:39,874 --> 00:46:43,874
These patterns allow services
to update independently and

703
00:46:43,874 --> 00:46:45,844
synchronize changes asynchronously.

704
00:46:46,694 --> 00:46:50,984
However, it's important to recognize
that while these strategies mitigate

705
00:46:50,984 --> 00:46:54,584
certain challenges, they can
introduce additional complexity.

706
00:46:55,084 --> 00:46:58,754
For example, event driven architecture
can make it harder to trace the

707
00:46:58,754 --> 00:47:02,814
flow of data and understand the
system's state at any given time.

708
00:47:03,314 --> 00:47:07,844
Balancing consistency, availability,
and scalability requires careful

709
00:47:07,884 --> 00:47:12,094
architectural consideration and deep
understanding of the trade offs involved.

710
00:47:12,994 --> 00:47:18,424
Some organizations use service meshes
to manage inter service communication,

711
00:47:18,744 --> 00:47:22,844
providing features like traffic management
and, security and observability.

712
00:47:23,564 --> 00:47:27,804
While these services meshes
can be powerful, they also add

713
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:29,244
another layer of complexity.

714
00:47:29,934 --> 00:47:34,844
In my work, I have found that for many
applications, especially those leveraging

715
00:47:34,864 --> 00:47:38,944
serverless and event driven architectures,
a service mesh might not be necessary.

716
00:47:39,444 --> 00:47:44,384
Instead, focusing on designing for
asynchronous communication and using

717
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:47,474
managed services can simplify the system.

718
00:47:47,974 --> 00:47:52,704
Ultimately, addressing distributed
systems Challenges in microservices

719
00:47:53,164 --> 00:47:58,144
requires thoughtful design and the
right set of tools and patterns.

720
00:47:58,984 --> 00:48:03,174
By implementing strategies like
asynchronous communication, retry

721
00:48:03,174 --> 00:48:07,394
policies, and eventual consistency,
we can build systems that are robust,

722
00:48:07,594 --> 00:48:12,234
scalable, and capable of handling the
complexities of a distributed environment.

723
00:48:12,734 --> 00:48:17,574
Next, we'll explore another common
critique, data management and consistency.

724
00:48:18,524 --> 00:48:24,404
Diving deeper into how we manage, how we
handle data across distributed services.

725
00:48:25,154 --> 00:48:30,174
And in microservice based systems, data
is often spread across multiple services,

726
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,584
each with its own database or data store.

727
00:48:34,064 --> 00:48:38,264
This leads to complexities that are
not present in a monolithic system.

728
00:48:39,014 --> 00:48:43,754
First, ensuring the data consistency
across services is more complex.

729
00:48:44,304 --> 00:48:48,344
Managing transactions that span across
multiple services isn't straightforward.

730
00:48:48,914 --> 00:48:53,694
Traditional asset transactions do not
extend easily in a distributed system.

731
00:48:54,454 --> 00:48:58,374
This can lead to difficulties in
maintaining a single source of truth.

732
00:48:59,094 --> 00:49:03,554
Data may reside in multiple
places, and keeping it synchronized

733
00:49:03,724 --> 00:49:05,084
requires careful planning.

734
00:49:05,644 --> 00:49:10,104
Organizations often struggle with the
idea In a microservice architecture,

735
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:15,724
data will be in multiple locations, and
that's okay with the right practices.

736
00:49:16,224 --> 00:49:19,414
Understanding and embracing
this reality is essential.

737
00:49:20,094 --> 00:49:21,784
how do we address these challenges?

738
00:49:22,284 --> 00:49:25,234
One key strategy is embracing
eventual consistency.

739
00:49:26,164 --> 00:49:31,664
Except that data might not be instantly
consistent across all services.

740
00:49:32,509 --> 00:49:36,639
Design systems to handle temporary
inconsistencies gracefully.

741
00:49:37,479 --> 00:49:43,129
Recognize that eventual consistency can be
a strength and not necessarily a weakness.

742
00:49:43,629 --> 00:49:48,899
By accepting that data will become
consistent over time, we can build

743
00:49:48,899 --> 00:49:50,929
more scalable and robust systems.

744
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:55,759
This requires a shift in mindset,
but opens up new possibilities

745
00:49:55,769 --> 00:49:57,569
for performance and resilience.

746
00:49:58,069 --> 00:50:01,939
Next, we can implement specific
patterns to manage distributed

747
00:50:01,989 --> 00:50:04,849
interactions and data consistency.

748
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:07,479
The Saga pattern is one such approach.

749
00:50:08,029 --> 00:50:11,469
It manages distributed transactions
by breaking them into a

750
00:50:11,469 --> 00:50:13,789
series of local transactions.

751
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:19,739
Each service plat, performs its local
transaction and then pushes an event

752
00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:22,259
or message to trigger the next action.

753
00:50:22,759 --> 00:50:27,759
If a failure occurs, compensating
transactions are to undo the

754
00:50:27,969 --> 00:50:30,679
changes made by previous services.

755
00:50:31,179 --> 00:50:36,469
This way, we maintain overall data
consistency as transactions are

756
00:50:36,509 --> 00:50:42,229
executed to undo the challenges or
the changes made by previous service.

757
00:50:42,729 --> 00:50:47,019
This way, we maintain overall
data consistency without relying

758
00:50:47,059 --> 00:50:48,539
on distributed transactions.

759
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:52,769
Another powerful platform, or
pattern, is event sourcing.

760
00:50:53,499 --> 00:50:59,249
Instead of storing just the current state,
we store all changes to the application

761
00:50:59,249 --> 00:51:01,919
state as a sequence of immutable events.

762
00:51:02,649 --> 00:51:06,079
The current state is reconstructed
by replaying these events.

763
00:51:06,769 --> 00:51:13,499
This ensures a single source of truth,
through an authoritative event log.

764
00:51:13,999 --> 00:51:18,049
Event sourcing provides a clear
audit trail and can simplify

765
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:20,169
debugging and compliance efforts.

766
00:51:20,829 --> 00:51:24,349
To implement these patterns
effectively, we can leverage tools

767
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:28,529
and frameworks that support messaging
and event driven architectures.

768
00:51:29,309 --> 00:51:34,709
Apache Kafka is a, is a popular
distributed event streaming platform

769
00:51:34,959 --> 00:51:38,589
that enables building real time
data pipelines and applications.

770
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:43,839
Cloud specific implementations like
Azure Service Bus, Azure Event Hubs, and

771
00:51:44,029 --> 00:51:49,849
AWS Kinesis offer similar capabilities
with seamless cloud integration.

772
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:54,219
These tools allow services
to communicate via events,

773
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:58,699
facilitating data synchronization
and consistency across the system.

774
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:04,169
By adopting these patterns and
leveraging them, appropriate tools, we

775
00:52:04,179 --> 00:52:06,909
can now overcome the data management.

776
00:52:07,289 --> 00:52:11,749
Next, we'll explore another common
critique, testing complexity, and

777
00:52:11,749 --> 00:52:16,539
discuss how to navigate the challenges of
testing in a microservices environment.

778
00:52:17,339 --> 00:52:22,649
With multiple services interacting, end
to end testing becomes more challenging.

779
00:52:22,979 --> 00:52:27,489
Coordinating and verifying the behavior
of numerous components can be complex.

780
00:52:28,344 --> 00:52:32,584
There is also an increased need for
extensive integration and contract

781
00:52:32,594 --> 00:52:38,194
testing to ensure services interact
correctly and adhere to agreed interfaces.

782
00:52:38,834 --> 00:52:40,374
But here is the opportunity.

783
00:52:41,084 --> 00:52:46,774
Because we've, separated everything into
independent services, we can better test

784
00:52:46,944 --> 00:52:48,854
the individual pieces of business logic.

785
00:52:49,384 --> 00:52:54,104
When testing a shipping service, for
example, we do not have to worry about

786
00:52:54,344 --> 00:52:59,074
how the payment service works, at least
not until we get into integration testing.

787
00:52:59,574 --> 00:53:05,454
This separation allows for more focused
and effective unit testing, ensuring each

788
00:53:05,454 --> 00:53:08,144
service functions correctly in isolation.

789
00:53:08,874 --> 00:53:11,784
Integration testing is important
in any architectural style,

790
00:53:11,954 --> 00:53:13,734
but crucial in microservices.

791
00:53:13,974 --> 00:53:18,344
By thoroughly testing the interaction
between services, we can catch

792
00:53:18,384 --> 00:53:22,724
issues early and ensure smooth
collaboration between components.

793
00:53:23,394 --> 00:53:28,324
Moreover, comprehensive testing
is not just about finding bugs.

794
00:53:28,324 --> 00:53:31,604
It is about finding, building
confidence amongst users.

795
00:53:31,804 --> 00:53:36,704
stakeholders, they need assurance
that what we are deploying will

796
00:53:36,704 --> 00:53:38,584
also will work as intended.

797
00:53:39,084 --> 00:53:43,334
In microservices, there's a lot of
happening underneath the covers,

798
00:53:43,604 --> 00:53:47,864
including services that stakeholders
didn't even explicitly ask for, but

799
00:53:47,904 --> 00:53:50,034
are necessary to realize their vision.

800
00:53:50,724 --> 00:53:54,724
Testing gives us the confidence
that these unseen components

801
00:53:55,034 --> 00:53:56,144
are functioning correctly.

802
00:53:56,999 --> 00:54:01,239
To navigate these challenges, we need
a comprehensive testing strategy that

803
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:03,379
includes multiple levels of testing.

804
00:54:04,224 --> 00:54:08,084
Unit testing, testing individual
components in isolation to

805
00:54:08,084 --> 00:54:09,524
verify their correctness.

806
00:54:09,824 --> 00:54:13,854
Next we have integration testing,
verifying that services interact

807
00:54:13,854 --> 00:54:15,354
correctly with each other.

808
00:54:15,674 --> 00:54:18,174
This is a vital in microservices.

809
00:54:18,694 --> 00:54:23,714
Contract testing, where we ensure
services adhere to agreed upon interfaces.

810
00:54:23,984 --> 00:54:27,904
And end to end testing, where
we test complete user flows

811
00:54:27,904 --> 00:54:29,384
using, through the system.

812
00:54:30,024 --> 00:54:31,034
These are essential.

813
00:54:31,259 --> 00:54:34,129
for validating the entire
application behavior.

814
00:54:34,629 --> 00:54:39,349
In terms of tools, PACT facilitates
contract testing by allowing us to

815
00:54:39,689 --> 00:54:42,679
define and verify services and contracts.

816
00:54:43,139 --> 00:54:46,049
It's something I've been
exploring and shows promise in

817
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:47,909
reducing integration issues.

818
00:54:48,349 --> 00:54:51,609
For end to end testing, tools
like Playwright and Selenium

819
00:54:51,869 --> 00:54:55,299
offer modern, automate UI testing.

820
00:54:55,669 --> 00:54:59,059
While these tools can be more
fragile, implementing them

821
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:01,339
correctly ensures they add value.

822
00:55:01,959 --> 00:55:04,469
But remember, they are at
the top of the pyramid.

823
00:55:04,789 --> 00:55:11,389
You've built up to other testing before
depending on end to end testing, giving

824
00:55:11,389 --> 00:55:14,129
it a strong foundation to rely on.

825
00:55:14,629 --> 00:55:17,439
However, this isn't a
presentation about testing tools.

826
00:55:17,769 --> 00:55:24,629
The key takeaway is the importance of
comprehensive testing to ensure we are

827
00:55:24,629 --> 00:55:29,539
deploying reliable software and instilling
the confidence with our stakeholders.

828
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:35,049
By continuously testing our code at every
stage, we catch issues early and reduce

829
00:55:35,049 --> 00:55:38,179
the risk of defects reaching production.

830
00:55:38,859 --> 00:55:43,789
In summary, while testing complexity
is a valid critique of microservices,

831
00:55:43,789 --> 00:55:46,269
it presents an opportunity.

832
00:55:46,659 --> 00:55:50,739
By leveraging comprehensive testing
strategies, we can assure our services

833
00:55:50,759 --> 00:55:54,679
not only work individually, but
also function seamlessly together.

834
00:55:55,624 --> 00:56:01,184
This thorough approach to testing builds
confidence amongst our stakeholders

835
00:56:01,394 --> 00:56:05,754
and helps us deliver robust, reliable
software that meets their needs.

836
00:56:06,254 --> 00:56:10,354
Okay, one last critique I want to
address today is the skills and

837
00:56:10,364 --> 00:56:11,974
expertise requirements they demand.

838
00:56:12,534 --> 00:56:16,724
Now, my first response to people raising
this type of critique is, boo hoo.

839
00:56:17,254 --> 00:56:20,934
If you are afraid of the need to
learn, then software development

840
00:56:20,954 --> 00:56:22,054
might not be right for you.

841
00:56:22,544 --> 00:56:26,294
If your team has a hard time with
this, then you need to work on that.

842
00:56:26,994 --> 00:56:28,474
But let's get back to the point.

843
00:56:28,884 --> 00:56:32,204
Some of the challenges normally
associated with microservices is that

844
00:56:32,434 --> 00:56:37,414
microservices necessitate a higher level
of expertise in DevOps, distributed

845
00:56:37,424 --> 00:56:40,424
systems, and cloud infrastructure.

846
00:56:41,134 --> 00:56:42,304
And they are not wrong.

847
00:56:42,654 --> 00:56:45,814
Teams need to understand complex
architectures, deployment

848
00:56:45,814 --> 00:56:50,284
processes, and the nuances of
managing distributed systems.

849
00:56:50,784 --> 00:56:55,104
Additionally, there is a
steep learning curve for teams

850
00:56:55,104 --> 00:56:56,724
transitioning to microservices.

851
00:56:57,194 --> 00:57:02,044
This transition requires a significant
mindset shift and adapt, adaption

852
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,364
to new practices and tools.

853
00:57:05,094 --> 00:57:09,374
However, this critique, while valid,
should not be seen as a negative.

854
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:14,089
In any architectural style,
continuous learning is essential,

855
00:57:14,659 --> 00:57:16,709
even with legacy systems.

856
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:20,539
New techniques are needed
to solve evolving problems.

857
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:23,769
Encouraging continuous learning
and professional development

858
00:57:23,789 --> 00:57:26,429
within the team is crucial.

859
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:32,009
Your company should foster a
culture of growth and development.

860
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:37,349
And we need to promote the idea that
learning is a key part of being a

861
00:57:37,389 --> 00:57:38,999
professional in software development.

862
00:57:39,769 --> 00:57:40,369
In fact,

863
00:57:40,869 --> 00:57:43,709
software development professionals
who do not want to learn

864
00:57:43,909 --> 00:57:45,609
are truly not professional.

865
00:57:46,109 --> 00:57:49,519
If one doesn't want to learn,
then perhaps software development

866
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,219
isn't right for the right path.

867
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:56,444
To support this continued learning, we
can leverage various external resources.

868
00:57:56,444 --> 00:58:01,564
For example, we can, utilize training
programs, workshops, and certification

869
00:58:01,564 --> 00:58:06,974

individual components in isolation.

1004
01:07:39,469 --> 01:07:43,069
This ensures that each service
functions correctly on its own.

1005
01:07:43,589 --> 01:07:48,299
Then, move to integration testing to
verify interactions between services,

1006
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:50,989
ensuring they work together as expected.

1007
01:07:51,559 --> 01:07:56,669
Contract testing is crucial for ensuring
service interfaces meet expectations.

1008
01:07:57,389 --> 01:08:02,189
Finally, perform end to end testing
using tools like Playwright or

1009
01:08:02,189 --> 01:08:06,489

microservices and create a robust,

1047
01:10:43,934 --> 01:10:46,264
scalable and efficient architecture.

1048
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:52,154
Now, having covered the technical best
practices, let's now focus on process,

1049
01:10:52,654 --> 01:10:56,454
on processes and tooling that can enhance
your microservices implementation.

1050
01:10:57,454 --> 01:11:01,194
In this section, we'll explore
three key strategies, leveraging

1051
01:11:01,194 --> 01:11:04,114
automation and infrastructure as
code, utilizing containerization

1052
01:11:04,114 --> 01:11:08,874
orchestration, and utilizing
appropriate tools and techniques.

1053
01:11:09,544 --> 01:11:15,044
These processes and tools are essential
for streamlining operations, ensuring

1054
01:11:15,074 --> 01:11:19,834
consistency and maximizing the efficiency
of your microservices architecture.

1055
01:11:20,334 --> 01:11:25,064
First, let's discuss leveraging
automation and infrastructure as code.

1056
01:11:25,574 --> 01:11:30,404
Automation and infrastructure as
code, or IAC, are crucial for, for

1057
01:11:30,404 --> 01:11:33,254
ensuring consistent and reliable
microservices environments.

1058
01:11:33,844 --> 01:11:38,484
By automating infrastructure,
provisioning, using tools like Terraform,

1059
01:11:38,984 --> 01:11:45,069
Azure Resource Manager, or ARM, BICEP
templates, or AWS CloudFormation.

1060
01:11:45,339 --> 01:11:48,869
You can define and manage your
infrastructure declaratively.

1061
01:11:49,459 --> 01:11:53,039
This approach ensures that your
infrastructure is consistent

1062
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:57,179
across all environments and reduces
manual configuration errors.

1063
01:11:57,869 --> 01:12:03,089
Next, streamline deployments using
CICD tools like Azure DevOps.

1064
01:12:03,229 --> 01:12:05,129
GitHub actions or Jenkins.

1065
01:12:05,629 --> 01:12:07,019
Automate your deployment processes.

1066
01:12:07,729 --> 01:12:11,509
and this will reduce manual
errors, increase reliability

1067
01:12:11,709 --> 01:12:13,209
and allow for faster iterations.

1068
01:12:13,709 --> 01:12:21,099
Automation and IAC provide consistency and
repeatability across development, testing

1069
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:25,619
and production environments, ensuring
that your microservice operates reliably

1070
01:12:25,619 --> 01:12:27,829
and without configurational drift.

1071
01:12:28,699 --> 01:12:33,649
By leveraging these processes and
tools, you can enhance your efficiency

1072
01:12:33,879 --> 01:12:36,179
and reliability of your microservices.

1073
01:12:36,679 --> 01:12:40,949
Next, let's explore utilizing
containerization and orchestration.

1074
01:12:41,809 --> 01:12:46,339
Containerization ensures
consistency and portability across

1075
01:12:46,339 --> 01:12:47,829
environments, different environments.

1076
01:12:48,409 --> 01:12:53,769
By containerizing services using Docker,
you can package microservices with all

1077
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:58,589
their dependencies, ensuring they run
consistently, regardless of environment.

1078
01:12:59,259 --> 01:13:03,519
For managing and orchestrating these
containers, Kubernetes is a powerful tool.

1079
01:13:03,869 --> 01:13:10,599
Whether you use AKS, EKS, or
GKE, Kubernetes ensures your

1080
01:13:10,609 --> 01:13:15,019
microservices are scalable, highly
available, and efficiently managed.

1081
01:13:15,509 --> 01:13:20,809
Additionally, serverless platforms like
Azure Container Apps, AWS Fargate, or

1082
01:13:20,809 --> 01:13:26,969
Google Cloud Run offer serverless options
that reduce operational overhead while

1083
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:32,989
providing The benefits of containerized
nation and orchestration by utilizing

1084
01:13:33,019 --> 01:13:36,849
containerization orchestration, you can
improve the scalability and portability.

1085
01:13:37,444 --> 01:13:41,164
and manageability of your
microservice architecture.

1086
01:13:41,664 --> 01:13:45,134
Finally, we have the importance
of utilizing appropriate

1087
01:13:45,134 --> 01:13:46,434
tools and technologies.

1088
01:13:46,904 --> 01:13:49,544
Selecting the right stack is essential.

1089
01:13:49,954 --> 01:13:53,954
Choose technologies that align with
your team's expertise and project

1090
01:13:53,954 --> 01:13:59,184
needs, ensuring that they are
compatible and can integrate seamlessly.

1091
01:13:59,914 --> 01:14:03,864
Leveraging cloud services can
significantly reduce operational burdens.

1092
01:14:04,314 --> 01:14:08,704
cloud native services Offer
scalability, reliability, and ease

1093
01:14:08,704 --> 01:14:12,374
of management, allowing your teams
to focus on developing features

1094
01:14:12,654 --> 01:14:15,004
rather than managing infrastructure.

1095
01:14:15,974 --> 01:14:19,364
Implementing observability
tools is crucial for monitoring

1096
01:14:19,374 --> 01:14:20,844
and debugging microservices.

1097
01:14:21,224 --> 01:14:27,214
Tools like open telemetry and, or Jagger
provide distributed tracing capabilities,

1098
01:14:27,494 --> 01:14:29,794
ensuring you gain insights into how.

1099
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:34,689
Request flow through your system
and identify potential bottlenecks.

1100
01:14:35,309 --> 01:14:40,759
By utilizing tools and techniques,
you can create a robust, scalable, and

1101
01:14:40,759 --> 01:14:45,419
efficient microservice architecture
that meets your project's demands and

1102
01:14:45,419 --> 01:14:47,529
aligns with your team's strengths.

1103
01:14:48,029 --> 01:14:52,229
One last thing I want to cover before
wrapping up is a quick synopsis of the

1104
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:56,359
four main architectural styles I brought
up at the beginning, and a quick comment

1105
01:14:56,399 --> 01:14:58,899
about when to use one over the other.

1106
01:14:59,399 --> 01:15:03,119
When considering architectural styles,
it's important to understand the different

1107
01:15:03,139 --> 01:15:04,599
strengths and weaknesses of each.

1108
01:15:05,349 --> 01:15:09,459
let's take a quick look into this
comparison, comparison matrix.

1109
01:15:10,209 --> 01:15:15,489
Monolithic architectures are generally
simpler to and faster for, smaller

1110
01:15:15,519 --> 01:15:19,369
projects, but they have limited
scalability and fault isolation.

1111
01:15:19,959 --> 01:15:23,249
Maintenance becomes complex
as the application grows.

1112
01:15:23,859 --> 01:15:29,599
In tier architectures offer moderate
scalability and fault isolation by

1113
01:15:29,619 --> 01:15:32,159
separating concerns into different layers.

1114
01:15:32,589 --> 01:15:36,879
It's suitable for medium to large
applications with clear ties

1115
01:15:37,049 --> 01:15:39,379
but becomes unnecessary complex.

1116
01:15:39,379 --> 01:15:44,269
Modular monolith architectures
improve scalability and fault

1117
01:15:44,359 --> 01:15:48,359
isolation by organizing the
application into well defined modules.

1118
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:52,419
This approach is faster for
meeting complexity projects

1119
01:15:52,909 --> 01:15:53,969
and easier to maintain.

1120
01:15:54,469 --> 01:16:00,059
And microservices excel in scalability,
fault isolation, and deployment

1121
01:16:00,059 --> 01:16:02,529
speed for large, complex projects.

1122
01:16:02,829 --> 01:16:07,519
However, they require skilled teams
and can be highly complex to manage.

1123
01:16:08,389 --> 01:16:13,079
To provide a clearer perspective, let's
look at real world examples of where each

1124
01:16:13,089 --> 01:16:18,049
architectural style is commonly used and
why it makes sense in those contexts.

1125
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:24,064
Monolithic architectures are often used
by early stage startups due to their

1126
01:16:24,064 --> 01:16:26,724
simplicity and quick development speed.

1127
01:16:27,104 --> 01:16:34,264
For example, a startup developing a basic
e commerce platform might use a monolithic

1128
01:16:34,264 --> 01:16:36,714
approach to get to the market quickly.

1129
01:16:37,214 --> 01:16:42,584
N tier architectures are well suited for
large enterprises with complex business

1130
01:16:42,594 --> 01:16:45,054
logic and multiple user interfaces.

1131
01:16:45,464 --> 01:16:52,094
For instance, a banking scenario our
banking, solution might use a, an

1132
01:16:52,094 --> 01:16:56,714
interior architecture to separate the
user interface, business logic and data

1133
01:16:56,724 --> 01:17:01,104
access layers, insurance, scalability
and maintainability medium sized

1134
01:17:01,124 --> 01:17:06,034
businesses, with growing complexity
and might benefit from a modular.

1135
01:17:06,634 --> 01:17:07,344
architecture.

1136
01:17:07,824 --> 01:17:11,394
An example is an online retail
company with separate modules

1137
01:17:11,394 --> 01:17:14,754
for inventory management, order
processing, and customer service.

1138
01:17:15,424 --> 01:17:19,534
This approach allows them to
maintain a single deployable

1139
01:17:19,544 --> 01:17:21,924
unit while managing complexity.

1140
01:17:22,424 --> 01:17:28,704
Now, large tech companies with complex
scalable systems often use microservices.

1141
01:17:29,094 --> 01:17:34,804
For instance, Netflix uses a microservice
architecture to handle the immense load

1142
01:17:35,044 --> 01:17:40,494
and complexity of delivering streaming
services to millions of users worldwide.

1143
01:17:41,054 --> 01:17:44,704
This approach allows for independent
scalability and fault isolation.

1144
01:17:45,204 --> 01:17:48,764
Now, these real world
examples are just examples.

1145
01:17:49,384 --> 01:17:53,074
They are, there are many
situations where any of these

1146
01:17:53,074 --> 01:17:54,664
architectures might be a good fit.

1147
01:17:55,174 --> 01:17:59,324
The importance is to scrutinize
your organization's needs and

1148
01:17:59,324 --> 01:18:03,554
determine the correct architectural
style for each particular solution.

1149
01:18:04,174 --> 01:18:05,754
Not one's fits all.

1150
01:18:06,024 --> 01:18:10,854
And just because you use one architectural
style for one solution doesn't mean you

1151
01:18:10,914 --> 01:18:16,374
always have to, or should, use the same
architectural style for other projects.
