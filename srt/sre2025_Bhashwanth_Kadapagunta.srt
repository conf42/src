00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:07,180
Hi, welcome everyone to the Reliability
Engineering 2025 conference.

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,830
I'm Bawan Carta.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,780
I'm a specialist leader at Deloitte's
AI and cloud engineering practice.

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,470
Today I will be talking about the
interesting topic of integrating

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:24,520
AI into cloud platforms and
provide a roadmap for enterprises.

6
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,230
Looking to undertake this journey.

7
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,980
So we'll start with a quick
introduction into these topics.

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,670
So the fusion of artificial
intelligence and cloud computing is

9
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:42,040
reshaping the enterprise landscape and
offering unprecedented opportunities

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,020
for innovation efficiency.

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,730
And, competitive advantage.

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,720
So far, businesses this is no longer
just a optional transformation, but

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,280
it's more of a strategic initiative.

14
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,480
However, the journey of integrating
these two technologies is is

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,970
complex and has its own challenges.

16
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,560
So it requires careful
planning robust architectures.

17
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,980
Also a clear understanding
of operational challenges.

18
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,820
So this talk aims to provide a detailed
roadmap for enterprises that are aiming to

19
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,060
integrate AI into their cloud ecosystems.

20
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,215
Next, we'll move on to the next slide.

21
00:01:17,715 --> 00:01:21,204
So why does AI and cloud
integration matter?

22
00:01:21,534 --> 00:01:26,294
The synergy between AI and cloud computing
is a game changer for enterprises.

23
00:01:26,634 --> 00:01:29,814
Cloud platforms provide the
scalable infrastructure needed

24
00:01:30,184 --> 00:01:32,134
to train and deploy AI models.

25
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:37,570
While AI enhances the cloud capabilities
with intelligent automation predictive

26
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,419
analytics, and real time decision making.

27
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,890
So together these two technologies
can enable organizations to accelerate

28
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:51,329
their innovation cycle optimize
operational efficiency as well as gain

29
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:53,959
actionable insights from vast data sets.

30
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:57,829
However this process is
not without its challenges.

31
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:02,579
There are a lot of issues related to data
governance, model management, and talent

32
00:02:02,669 --> 00:02:08,459
shortages that need to be addressed before
we can take advantage of the integration

33
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:09,569
of these two technologies, please.

34
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:14,724
So next we will look into why
building the right architecture.

35
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:18,034
Is key to enabling this integration.

36
00:02:18,814 --> 00:02:25,114
So many organizations operate in hybrid
or multi-cloud environments to avoid

37
00:02:25,164 --> 00:02:27,684
vendor lock-in and to optimize costs.

38
00:02:27,874 --> 00:02:33,244
Integrating AI into these setups requires
a unified architecture that ensures

39
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:35,734
seamless data flow and model deployment.

40
00:02:35,954 --> 00:02:42,274
Using strategies such as, open standards
Kubernetes for interoperability as

41
00:02:42,274 --> 00:02:46,934
well as implementing a data fabric
to enable consistent data access.

42
00:02:47,124 --> 00:02:51,954
And this combined with emerging
technologies such as edge computing,

43
00:02:51,984 --> 00:02:56,289
serverless computing these are
going to enable organizations to

44
00:02:56,289 --> 00:02:59,199
have the foundational framework
and the architecture required

45
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:01,039
to support this integration.

46
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:05,119
Also importantly, AI
integration must align with the

47
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,859
enterprise business objectives.

48
00:03:07,089 --> 00:03:11,989
A use case driven approach ensures
that these AI initiatives are not

49
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:16,604
just technology playbooks, but that
they deliver tangible value as well.

50
00:03:17,104 --> 00:03:21,274
Next we will move on to look
at what are the key challenges.

51
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:25,039
In that we see in this journey
and how to overcome them.

52
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:29,049
So AI models typically
rely on high quality data.

53
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:36,119
So enterprises must establish robust
data governance to ensure data privacy,

54
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:40,299
but also to critical things such
as security, compliance, et cetera.

55
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,269
So key strategies here include
implementing data lineage.

56
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:49,279
And using automated tools for data
cleaning and pre-processing, et cetera.

57
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:53,749
And on top of that it's also
critical to have lifecycle management

58
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:58,549
capabilities for all of the machine
learning operational readiness, right?

59
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:02,979
This includes things such as version
control, CICD pipelines and real

60
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:06,919
time monitoring of the performance
of these models and keeping track

61
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,479
of them to enhance them further.

62
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:11,749
Last, but not the least
is the talent strategy.

63
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:16,149
Enterprises must invest in upskilling
existing employees and attracting

64
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:22,154
specialized talent to support AI and
cloud integration initiatives to bridge

65
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:24,539
the skill gap that currently exists.

66
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:28,099
So now that we spoke about
the foundational components.

67
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,199
Next we'll look at a step-by-step roadmap
for enterprises looking to undertake

68
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,509
the cloud AI integration journey.

69
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:41,404
So this is divided into a logical
phases four phases that will

70
00:04:41,434 --> 00:04:45,969
help organizations reach their
transformation goals in a phased manner.

71
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,329
Phase one here we start with,
building the foundations.

72
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:54,339
These include things such as assessing
the AI maturity and identifying like

73
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,689
the high impact use cases, establishing
data governance that we discussed

74
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:03,209
previously and also, selecting the
cloud platforms and vendors that

75
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:07,159
align with the enterprise goals and
with those foundational capabilities.

76
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:10,279
Next you can move on to the pilot
deployment, which would include,

77
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:15,499
development and deployment of the
pilot AI models for selected use cases.

78
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:20,299
And then on top of that,
implementing the ML ops pipelines

79
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:22,609
and practices for model management.

80
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:26,299
And then also being able to
evaluate the model and fine tune

81
00:05:26,299 --> 00:05:28,094
the model for performance as needed.

82
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:31,844
Once the pilot deployment is
successful, then organizations can

83
00:05:31,844 --> 00:05:33,974
look into scaling and optimization.

84
00:05:34,344 --> 00:05:37,944
This would involve scaling successful
pilots across different line of

85
00:05:37,944 --> 00:05:42,764
businesses within the enterprise,
optimizing the architecture for cost,

86
00:05:42,764 --> 00:05:44,714
performance, scalability, et cetera.

87
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:50,134
And also integrating emerging technologies
like edge computing, serverless and so on.

88
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:53,854
And the last phase would
involve continuous improvement.

89
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:58,004
This is where the scaled model
has to be monitored and all

90
00:05:58,004 --> 00:05:59,864
the KPIs track diligently.

91
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:04,074
So that, any process improvements,
any technology related improvements

92
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:08,914
can be monitored and can be
incorporated facilitating continuous

93
00:06:08,914 --> 00:06:11,314
improvement into the whole framework.

94
00:06:11,814 --> 00:06:16,844
Now that we've looked at how
organizations can take a phase approach

95
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:21,524
to reach their transformation goals
in terms of AI and cloud integration.

96
00:06:21,824 --> 00:06:25,564
Now we'll quickly look at what
the future holds for this area.

97
00:06:26,064 --> 00:06:30,510
So the integration of AI and cloud
integration is very much a evolving

98
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:34,510
field with several emerging trends
that are set to shape its future.

99
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:40,220
Ai cloud cloud management using
AI tools which uses AI to optimize

100
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,660
cloud resource allocation.

101
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,396
Then we have, federated learning which.
