1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,770
Today I'm excited to walk you through
how we used SRE Principles and

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,500
Advanced Mission Learning to solve a
real business pain point fraud in MCC

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,450
reimbursement, the fraudulent activities
within the Michigan Catastrophic

4
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,240
Association reimbursement System.

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:22,470
Industry billions annually with
insurance for 40 billion in

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,050
across all non insurance sector.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,650
The c. C faces increasingly
sophisticated challenges.

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:35,925
The traditional detection on manual review
and rule based system have proven in.

9
00:00:36,425 --> 00:00:40,505
Trans fraud prevention in
MCC reimbursement landscape,

10
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:45,074
so this scale of insurance fraud,
the fraud in insurance is not

11
00:00:45,074 --> 00:00:50,714
new, but it's growing US Insurance
fraud costs over 40 billion a

12
00:00:50,714 --> 00:00:53,175
year, excluding health insurance.

13
00:00:53,675 --> 00:00:57,815
MCCA reimbursements are particularly
vulnerable due to high value

14
00:00:57,815 --> 00:00:59,285
nature of medical claims.

15
00:00:59,785 --> 00:01:03,864
Traditional systems catch
fraud late or not at all.

16
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,804
Imagine catching it after
millions are paid out.

17
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:08,755
That is not sustainable.

18
00:01:09,294 --> 00:01:11,755
We need a real time in
intelligence system.

19
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:12,855
The MCC.

20
00:01:13,355 --> 00:01:16,745
Auto insurance claims that exceed
standard coverage thresholds,

21
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:21,515
making it particularly vulnerable
to high value fraud schemes.

22
00:01:22,055 --> 00:01:25,745
These sophisticated operations
often involve networks of

23
00:01:25,745 --> 00:01:30,515
providers, attorneys, and claimants
working in to exploit the system.

24
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:35,030
The financial impact extended beyond
direct losses affecting premium

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,350
rates for all policyholders and.

26
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,120
The limitation of fraud detection.

27
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,970
A legacy method involves manual
review and rule-based systems.

28
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:50,595
Problems are, rules are outdated and
easy for fraudster to work around.

29
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,510
Manual process do not scale.

30
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,960
We're talking about
thousands of claims per week.

31
00:01:57,529 --> 00:02:02,630
Data silos across systems
and direction limit context.

32
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:08,300
The results, which is most fraud
is detected after the post-payment

33
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,810
and some is not caught at all.

34
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,900
The traditional methods struggles
to emerging fraud patterns.

35
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,020
High value claims present, particular
challenge environment where sophisticated

36
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:26,060
fraud schemes can easily bypass
conventional detection approach.

37
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,720
So advanced mission learning advantages,

38
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:36,720
the mission learning models learn patterns
and it uncover and improves with the data.

39
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:43,400
Flag suspicious claims before payout,
reducing risk and operational burden.

40
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:50,325
The mission learning at speed scale,
consistency, the things which humans

41
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:52,404
alone can't manage effectively.

42
00:02:53,024 --> 00:02:57,364
So advanced mission learning
transforms broad detection by a.

43
00:02:57,864 --> 00:02:59,994
Processing vast amounts of data.

44
00:02:59,994 --> 00:03:05,625
Instant, these systems can identify SubT
connection between seemingly unrelated

45
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:12,255
claims and detect organized frauds
that might otherwise remain hidden.

46
00:03:12,755 --> 00:03:14,124
Key mission learning technologies,

47
00:03:14,624 --> 00:03:21,199
which c. Scan images, data from medical
documents and detect tampering or

48
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:27,589
duplication, which is basically visualize
the data such as medical images, extend

49
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:31,879
photos and scan documents, and then it
can detect manipulated or inconsistency.

50
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,464
Esry often used in the.

51
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:41,264
Excel, identifying suspicious patterns in
claim histories, treatment sequences, and

52
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:44,344
billing that human reviewers might miss.

53
00:03:44,844 --> 00:03:47,664
And the last one is transformer models.

54
00:03:48,164 --> 00:03:52,354
State of natural languages
processing technology that

55
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:57,694
examines narrative descriptions
in the claims for inconsistencies.

56
00:03:58,194 --> 00:04:02,114
Language patterns associated, these
technologies have demonstrated

57
00:04:02,714 --> 00:04:08,894
23% improvement in fraud detection
accuracy compared to early methods,

58
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:14,974
substantially reducing losses while
streamlining the claim process.

59
00:04:15,474 --> 00:04:21,684
Using modern streaming stream
protic processing tools like

60
00:04:22,134 --> 00:04:25,394
Kafka Flink, we are enabled.

61
00:04:25,394 --> 00:04:30,624
Subsequent fraud detection claims are
now screened in real time with the

62
00:04:31,014 --> 00:04:33,474
all generated before once released.

63
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,204
This drastically reduces false.

64
00:04:36,704 --> 00:04:41,379
Focus on focus only on high
risk prioritized cases.

65
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:46,309
With the advanced machine learning
system, it's gonna be enable near

66
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,739
instance fraud detection, and it's
gonna reduce the time between the claim

67
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:53,739
submission and fraud identification.

68
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:59,279
The speed is crucial for high value
MCC claims where early detection can

69
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:02,759
prevent substantial loss and reduce
the complexity of recovery efforts.

70
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:08,389
So the realtime analysis allows insurers
to intervene before payments are issued.

71
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:14,769
Shifting from a reactive to
proactive fraud prevention approach.

72
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:18,689
Feder learning cross
jurisdiction data sharing.

73
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:23,809
So a breakthrough in data
collaboration, federated learning.

74
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:28,434
It allows insurers are agencies
to retain shared models

75
00:05:28,764 --> 00:05:30,594
without sharing sensitive data.

76
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:33,944
Each party trained share raw.

77
00:05:34,444 --> 00:05:36,064
Compliance and privacy.

78
00:05:37,054 --> 00:05:42,114
This help us identify cross fraud
drinks without violating data laws.

79
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:47,684
So the Predator Learning allows
in rare regulators and MCCA

80
00:05:47,684 --> 00:05:51,434
collaboration on fraud detection
while maintaining data privacy and.

81
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:57,064
Approach, 85 to 90% of centralized
detection accuracy while keeping

82
00:05:57,064 --> 00:06:02,644
sensitive data within its original
direction, enabling unprecedented

83
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,714
cross organization collaboration.

84
00:06:05,214 --> 00:06:08,414
So the miserable business impact, and you.

85
00:06:08,914 --> 00:06:14,434
These results are speaking the volume,
50% drop in fraudulent payouts in

86
00:06:14,764 --> 00:06:21,314
pilot areas, reduce manual review by
70% and positive rate drop meaning

87
00:06:21,524 --> 00:06:24,224
fewer delays for genuine claims.

88
00:06:24,944 --> 00:06:28,904
All this leads to better
customer satisfaction, which.

89
00:06:29,404 --> 00:06:34,474
So 50 to 60 reduction in losses
within the first year of deployment,

90
00:06:35,074 --> 00:06:40,344
and additionally, there's a 40 to
50% decrease in manual as AI systems

91
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:47,034
screening, allowing human investigators
to focus on complex cases requiring.

92
00:06:47,534 --> 00:06:53,714
Friction in the claims claim process
and increasing overall satisfaction,

93
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:57,129
emerging technologies and
future predictions directions.

94
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:00,239
So these emerging
technologies, what is next?

95
00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:01,259
Next?

96
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:05,509
The process are evolving and so must we.

97
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,575
So what are the next gen capabilities?

98
00:07:08,075 --> 00:07:12,135
Biometric, which is basically
a multifactor that combines

99
00:07:12,135 --> 00:07:13,215
facial recognitions.

100
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:18,005
Verification, this advanced system
that can authenticate medical records,

101
00:07:18,185 --> 00:07:22,805
police reports, and other documentation
by analyzing the microscopic printing

102
00:07:22,805 --> 00:07:29,075
patterns, signature and constant
consistency, and the predictive modeling.

103
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:35,915
This is next generation algorithm that
identifies potential fraud schemes

104
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:42,094
before by analyzing emerging patterns
and anomalies across the industry.

105
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:48,290
These technologies prevents cutting
edge of fraud prevention, offering the

106
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:53,540
MCC and in unprecedented capabilities
to stay ahead of increasingly

107
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,550
sophisticated fraud schemes.

108
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,710
Each builds up upon the foundation
of current mission learning

109
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,370
language systems while addressing.

110
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,450
So what are

111
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,850
regulatory complaints,
considerations when using the

112
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,690
Sable results?

113
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:14,030
That can be justified to
regulators and policy holders.

114
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:19,310
This includes documentation of training,
data sourcing, and addition factors,

115
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,220
data privacy, compliance, maintaining
compliance with the state and federal

116
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,590
privacy regulations while leveraging
comprehensive data or fraud detection.

117
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,515
This requires robust data.

118
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:37,385
To prevent outcomes in automated
fraud detection systems with

119
00:08:37,805 --> 00:08:42,425
regular audit, potential bias,
human oversight intervention.

120
00:08:43,205 --> 00:08:49,445
So we need to establish protocols
where human experts review algorithm

121
00:08:49,475 --> 00:08:51,485
decision, particularly for.

122
00:08:51,985 --> 00:08:56,335
Implementation, careful attention to
regulatory requirements and ethical

123
00:08:56,335 --> 00:09:01,345
standards by designing system with
the compliance in mind from the

124
00:09:01,435 --> 00:09:06,855
outset insurers, and avoid refall
while maximizing fraud detection.

125
00:09:07,355 --> 00:09:08,860
So the implementation.

126
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,460
First, we need to assess the current
process, which is we need to evaluate the

127
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,630
current vulnerability and data readiness.

128
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:18,910
Started small.

129
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:24,615
We need to start with the pilot
program and start with the

130
00:09:24,615 --> 00:09:28,445
targeted implementation, high
risk areas, trained models.

131
00:09:28,595 --> 00:09:28,655
It.

132
00:09:29,155 --> 00:09:31,405
Bring the staff and develop ai.

133
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:35,775
Human collaboration scale
gradually adding more claim types

134
00:09:36,045 --> 00:09:38,505
and integrating across regions.

135
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:44,805
So the key was cross-functional
collaboration and agile iterations.

136
00:09:45,305 --> 00:09:49,685
Successful implementation of
A-M-L-M-C-C, A fraud prevention

137
00:09:49,685 --> 00:09:51,425
request, a strategic approach.

138
00:09:52,145 --> 00:09:54,095
Begin with the assessment.

139
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:57,715
Current fraud vulnerabilities
and data management capabilities.

140
00:09:58,105 --> 00:10:02,995
Develop a pilot program, target high
risk claims categories to demonstrate

141
00:10:03,495 --> 00:10:05,985
early wins and refine the system.

142
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:12,005
Gradually scale the solution across
all claims types while fostering an

143
00:10:12,065 --> 00:10:16,490
organizational culture that effectively
combines human expertise with the mission.

144
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,210
Mission intelligence.

145
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,370
This balance approach delivers
a great impact while minimizing

146
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:26,300
disruption to operations.

147
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,010
Thank.
