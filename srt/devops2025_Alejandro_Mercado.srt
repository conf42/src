1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,240
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,250
I'm Alex.

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,460
Very honored to be here.

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,959
once again, I can say, so I am
going to talk a little bit about,

5
00:00:11,569 --> 00:00:15,279
AI, you know, AI is everywhere.

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:22,219
Nowadays you can find it in, I can see
in every single aspect of our life.

7
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:23,239
So.

8
00:00:23,909 --> 00:00:25,169
as a DevOps engineer.

9
00:00:25,169 --> 00:00:29,160
I'm going to talk about a little
bit about the impact of artificial

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,370
intelligence in our daily activities.

11
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:39,300
So this is leveraging AI in DevOps, next
generation strategies for enhance and

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,910
efficiency, efficiency and innovation.

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,710
So a little bit about, about me.

14
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,160
I'm Alejandro Mercado
Rice and born in Mexico.

15
00:00:49,205 --> 00:00:56,474
I, I do the bobs as I said,
technical writer and speaker.

16
00:00:57,064 --> 00:00:58,275
Sometimes I speak.

17
00:00:58,775 --> 00:01:02,824
So there is, if you want to reach
me, there is my, you can see my

18
00:01:02,824 --> 00:01:05,174
information right on the slide.

19
00:01:05,854 --> 00:01:06,375
So.

20
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:11,514
Talking about some predictions, I don't,
I don't like to talk about predictions.

21
00:01:11,544 --> 00:01:19,334
I can say, I will rather say perspective
because I mean, I don't have a crystal

22
00:01:19,334 --> 00:01:25,275
ball, but for sure we are going to
see this, this trendings, in this year

23
00:01:25,325 --> 00:01:27,055
and the following a couple of years.

24
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,990
in the following years.

25
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,860
So, so we are going to keep seeing,
of course, a lot of artificial

26
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,160
intelligence, quantum computing,
computing, 5G connections.

27
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:44,900
H computing block, more blockchain,
more blockchains, cyber security is a

28
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,900
major factor in, in all the industry.

29
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,060
The software development industry,
augmented reality, sustainable

30
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,460
technologies, remote work and
collaboration tools, human.

31
00:01:59,155 --> 00:02:02,745
Human computer interaction is
something that we are evolving at.

32
00:02:02,805 --> 00:02:05,375
We, for sure, we are going
to see more about that.

33
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:08,995
More experiments, more
projects, more technologies.

34
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:13,535
And I can say a lot of these
technologies and trending technologies

35
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:15,125
are going to overlap for sure.

36
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:19,335
I mean, you can do human
computer interaction based on AI.

37
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:24,045
and I mean, overlapping is
going to be pretty common.

38
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:31,885
So Why the bobs and why and where
is relevant artificial intelligence

39
00:02:31,905 --> 00:02:36,465
that the bobs, practices, we have
been doing the bobs a lot of time.

40
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:40,185
You know, you can see
this, this, timeline.

41
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:47,185
so right now we can see in the, in the
last, Bullet or milestone that DevOps

42
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:49,635
is like a present or regular practice.

43
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:54,645
I can say right now in a lot of
companies adopted DevOps because

44
00:02:54,665 --> 00:02:57,515
they are seeing the advantages.

45
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:04,005
So what we are doing now is to
increase the maturity and the

46
00:03:04,405 --> 00:03:07,075
productivity while doing DevOps.

47
00:03:07,845 --> 00:03:14,095
So, so, well, this is a, the traditional,
I can say, So you can see each one of the

48
00:03:14,405 --> 00:03:17,975
software development like cycle phases.

49
00:03:18,495 --> 00:03:23,775
So, you know, it's, it's your plan,
code, build, test, release, deploy,

50
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:26,645
operate, monitor, and repeat.

51
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:29,015
And this is like an infinite loop.

52
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:36,445
So I bring this to the
conversation because in each phase.

53
00:03:36,945 --> 00:03:38,955
We can use artificial intelligence.

54
00:03:39,365 --> 00:03:46,465
So of course, as a engineer,
we are doing more with less.

55
00:03:47,015 --> 00:03:49,715
I mean, we can code, we
can test, we can plan.

56
00:03:49,715 --> 00:03:55,905
We can, and have like this secretary
or assistant to help us to, to increase

57
00:03:55,905 --> 00:03:58,815
our productivity and be more efficient.

58
00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:02,835
Spend the better the time.

59
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,925
I mean, you can spend more
time in important things.

60
00:04:06,165 --> 00:04:09,095
So for sure, this is one
of the main advantage.

61
00:04:09,485 --> 00:04:13,905
I am not saying that artificial
for, for, for, for sure.

62
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:16,565
I'm not saying that artificial
intelligence is going to replace

63
00:04:16,565 --> 00:04:23,935
humans, but we need this kind of, AI
to be more efficient and they are here.

64
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:30,840
So the idea is if you take a look of each
one of these phases, there is a tool on

65
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,160
the market, open source or proprietary to
help us to accomplish these activities.

66
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,210
So I just want to, to mention
a couple of these, because we

67
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,910
have, In, in every single aspect.

68
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:48,700
If, if you consider the, the whole
DevOp cycle we have in, in deployment

69
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:54,610
and incident management and, and code
testing and quality analysis, and

70
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:00,250
in the monitoring and observability
field, we have a lot of tools helping

71
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,490
us to improve our, well every aspect.

72
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,060
We, we, at them, we are going
to have more secure software.

73
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:16,570
box, decrease the, the, the time to
repair or even to, to acknowledge the,

74
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,250
the Abu on, on production environments.

75
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:24,700
So definitely because systems are
getting more and more complex.

76
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,240
The landscape are.

77
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,650
Cloud, on premise, hybrid, multi
cloud, different databases.

78
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,530
I mean, there is a lot of
considerations, a lot of components,

79
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,480
microservices, mono, monolithics,
containers, et cetera, et cetera.

80
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,350
So there is no.

81
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:47,110
enough human power to attend all of these
aspects and to take care about everything.

82
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:53,420
So we need this, this, this tools
to, to help us to in our activities.

83
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:53,940
So.

84
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,100
One aspect that we are talking,
the, the last, it is not new.

85
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,980
I, we can say that last couple of
years is, is an operation side.

86
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,670
You know, having this code, this piece
of code on, on production, it means that

87
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:16,540
there is going to be a lot of activity
attending users, request, latency.

88
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,200
So.

89
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,640
We talk now about AI ops.

90
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:26,480
I mean, the operation assisted by, by
artificial intelligence, to detect to

91
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,700
early detect some problem, even, even,

92
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,780
we talk now about observability
versus monitoring, meaning that

93
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,640
we can be proactive in what
is going on with our software.

94
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,770
I mean, we can detect if we
have a pattern that I mean, is.

95
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,850
By correlation, we can know if something
is going to fail, it's going to fail

96
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:53,370
because it's taking a lot of resources
or latency or it's taking a lot of time.

97
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:53,930
I don't know.

98
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,190
It depends on the day.

99
00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:02,070
So we can find a root cause, before even
it fails, even the, the user, notice.

100
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,100
So this is, this is pretty important.

101
00:07:05,095 --> 00:07:08,155
Because of course we can,
we can save a lot of money.

102
00:07:08,655 --> 00:07:11,355
So new frontiers.

103
00:07:11,535 --> 00:07:12,695
Yeah, for sure.

104
00:07:12,695 --> 00:07:17,365
Well, we are seeing new frontiers
in each aspect of the, the, the,

105
00:07:17,365 --> 00:07:21,935
the, the, the, the DevOps cycle,
like in the project management.

106
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:26,685
we can see a lot of open
source or commercial tools.

107
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:34,870
Like I can say, just to name a few,
Jira, Asana, Notion, et cetera.

108
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,110
They are all based on artificial
intelligence, but they are adding some

109
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:47,900
features based on intelligent AI to,
to be so, so we can be more productive.

110
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,190
This is like an experiment, something
that I have been working on.

111
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:58,690
It's, it's, you know, we have these
boys skills assistants, in, at home.

112
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,210
So, so we are going to
see these new frontiers.

113
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,030
And one of these frontier
is the, the boys assistants.

114
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,290
So I started to think, and why, why not?

115
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:15,060
I can handle my daily activities
with, with just my voice because

116
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,120
I can handle some difference.

117
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,650
I don't know, pipelines, clusters,
health, et cetera, et cetera.

118
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,810
Many related activities to DevOps.

119
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:30,950
Well, I want, I am driving or I
don't know, I mean, hands free.

120
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,600
So I started this experiment is, is, is
at this moment is just running on Alexa.

121
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:41,100
Because I, there's no, no other
reason than, than I have an Alexa.

122
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,030
so my experiment is about this
integration of voice control

123
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,090
technology with Kubernetes management.

124
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:56,030
So, so I can same, I can, trigger an Alexa
skill just to manage my cluster so I can

125
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:02,460
monitor, I mean, if, if there is an error
or the systems goes down, I can notice.

126
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:09,770
with, with an alarm in my Alexa, or
I can do some, administrative tasks.

127
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,110
So, well, this is a work in progress,
but it's, it's something like that.

128
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,620
so I can, there is a, an activate
voice command, open Kubernetes manager,

129
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:24,930
so I can create a cluster, destroy
the cluster to ask for the help.

130
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,480
It's some, some, some node is failing.

131
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,870
I just want to know about it.

132
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:37,940
So, well, this is something that, if I
think about it, I can monitor or I can

133
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:43,430
handle manage every aspect of my daily
activities, but of course it's requires

134
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:48,800
a lot of, I mean, instead of using the
regular input, that is the keyboard.

135
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:53,540
Well, maybe some tasks can be
done through the, to the boys.

136
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,190
So, so I think this is.

137
00:09:55,905 --> 00:10:01,035
Like the things that I, I want to see
that we are going to see in, in a couple

138
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:04,005
of years that we are evolving for sure.

139
00:10:04,695 --> 00:10:11,085
So why, because we can have this increases
efficiency, we can reduce error in his

140
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:14,375
collaboration, improve accessibility.

141
00:10:14,435 --> 00:10:19,505
That is a very important aspect of
using voice assistance technologies

142
00:10:19,985 --> 00:10:24,485
so we can have streamline
workflows and contextual awareness.

143
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,765
So yeah, for sure we are going to see
this kind of trending, this kind of new

144
00:10:29,805 --> 00:10:34,705
technology or some not so new technologies
helping us in our daily activities.

145
00:10:35,205 --> 00:10:38,685
Project manager, we already talked
about a little bit of a project

146
00:10:38,735 --> 00:10:41,005
management powered AI tools.

147
00:10:41,505 --> 00:10:47,395
in the side of code generation, I
mean, when I'm writing code, I can

148
00:10:47,395 --> 00:10:51,510
get a lot of help from Any of these
ones, choose your favorite one,

149
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,840
GitHub, Coursera are pretty famous one.

150
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,730
so, so we can be more productive because,
well, this is something that we do a lot.

151
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:04,060
I mean, some, some, sometimes we don't
know about a method or, or a property.

152
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:11,120
So we come to, to Google it or to,
to ask in a stack overflow or other.

153
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,440
other sites to get some help.

154
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,990
And this is something that we do a lot of.

155
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:24,250
So instead of going to through these
portals or forums, we can just write

156
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,380
what we need and it's going to help us.

157
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,490
I mean, it's not going to replace us.

158
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:37,760
We, we, we have the, the, the wheel, but
the steering wheel But definitely it's

159
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,910
going to, it's, it's, it's like having a,
an assistant, like doing pair programming.

160
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:50,390
So this is in the, in the generative
code side, even in the testing, in the

161
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,410
testing side, we have a lot of options.

162
00:11:54,170 --> 00:12:00,170
So we can conduct any, any type of, or
almost any type of, of testing, like

163
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,530
continuous, static units, testing,
code coverage, mutation testing.

164
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:10,845
Using these tools like JetBrains,
Snyk, SonarQube, et cetera, et cetera.

165
00:12:11,345 --> 00:12:17,345
So in general terms, we are going
to find, we currently find a lot

166
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:26,115
of AA based DevOps tools, like for
automated infra provisioning, like,

167
00:12:26,945 --> 00:12:30,615
Ansible or in the other side for.

168
00:12:31,155 --> 00:12:36,095
For incident response like Splunk,
Datadog, ServiceNow, et cetera, et cetera.

169
00:12:36,105 --> 00:12:41,305
There is a, a, a, a huge
explosion of these kind of tools.

170
00:12:41,805 --> 00:12:48,685
So, In the, in the site of infrastructure
of ASCOTE, we are seeing right now a lot

171
00:12:48,705 --> 00:12:55,435
of traditional Tools like Terraform that
they are using now, they are powered

172
00:12:55,435 --> 00:13:01,515
by, AI to help us to create a more
robust code and to, it can detect if

173
00:13:01,555 --> 00:13:07,035
there is not consistency in our, at the
moment of provisioning the resources.

174
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:12,995
So, yeah, of course it's, it's in every,
in every single aspect of our project.

175
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:15,735
So we're developing like sample.

176
00:13:15,805 --> 00:13:22,785
So, so you can take a look of any,
any, so if, if you are more on the site

177
00:13:22,855 --> 00:13:30,725
reliability engineer side, you have
this, service level object at the DNA,

178
00:13:30,725 --> 00:13:36,995
so of course you are going to improve
the, the service level on your teeth.

179
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,280
With this kind of tools.

180
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:45,620
So in summary, server ledged objectives
are essential in DevOps cycle, as

181
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:51,010
they provide clear and measureable
way to define, monitor, and improve

182
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:55,410
the quality of services, ultimately
driving better outcomes for the

183
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,870
business and its customers, for sure.

184
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:58,930
So.

185
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:04,650
Well, I, I would like to quote this,
AI is not the future, it's the present.

186
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:09,690
So take that in, if you, when
I take away, this can be one.

187
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,820
a lot of these, tools, are based on logs.

188
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:19,210
You know, logs can say a lot of things and
we can find through the logs, root cows.

189
00:14:19,745 --> 00:14:25,015
So CloudWatch is one of many, many
of the monitoring and observability

190
00:14:25,015 --> 00:14:26,455
services that we can find.

191
00:14:26,805 --> 00:14:31,475
Well, this is, of course,
running in AWS, but any other

192
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,595
cloud provider have, have logs.

193
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:39,635
So the importance of having logs
is that we can have these AI

194
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,405
power tools to get the root cause.

195
00:14:41,905 --> 00:14:44,695
So, yeah, that's why I bring
it into the conversation.

196
00:14:44,945 --> 00:14:55,405
So I drive in the Bob's causes, besides
the single Presti practice of AIOps is

197
00:14:55,465 --> 00:15:00,655
automated infrastructure provisioning,
predictive maintenance, code quality

198
00:15:00,655 --> 00:15:06,109
analysis, intelligent incident
responses, and automated density.

199
00:15:06,109 --> 00:15:08,349
So you can be.

200
00:15:08,849 --> 00:15:15,559
Way, way more productive with, with these
tools than, I mean, like an attrition

201
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:21,069
now, team that is doing this manual,
it's, it's, it's tough to, to measure the

202
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:27,529
impact of, AI in, in DevOps, because, I
mean, sometimes we don't even notice that

203
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:30,219
the, the, this kind of tools are using.

204
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:35,969
The, the, these technologies, or
we don't have like a metric to say,

205
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:38,859
well, I started to, to use copilot.

206
00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:42,609
So I commit, in shorter time.

207
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:47,019
So, well, I mean, it's difficult,
but according to some studies,

208
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:53,329
some studies by Garner, we, we, the
impact, for instance, in the meantime,

209
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:56,279
to recovery is reduced by 25%.

210
00:15:56,654 --> 00:16:01,664
Well, in terms of, you know,
this is related to money.

211
00:16:01,664 --> 00:16:07,004
So, so we are saving 25%, because
the system is, is, is not down.

212
00:16:07,504 --> 00:16:12,034
deployment frequency, you know,
you are going to have more value

213
00:16:12,064 --> 00:16:17,964
because You are streaming the
value because you are increasing

214
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:21,184
the deployment frequency by 30%.

215
00:16:21,484 --> 00:16:26,864
So, so, well, these are just,
to be honest, I don't know how

216
00:16:26,894 --> 00:16:33,204
these guys, calculate the, these
metrics, but I mean, it's something

217
00:16:33,204 --> 00:16:34,994
that we are going to talk more.

218
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:40,564
And it's, it's going to be in our daily
dialogues and conversations at the office.

219
00:16:41,064 --> 00:16:46,174
So of course there are, challenges,
you know, the whole DevOps theory

220
00:16:46,184 --> 00:16:48,794
is, is more cultural than practices.

221
00:16:49,294 --> 00:16:55,444
It's, it's a long journey and there
is a lot of implementation challenges.

222
00:16:55,444 --> 00:16:56,244
Yes, I can say.

223
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:01,889
So like, you know, the, the hallucination,
sometimes you don't, you don't get

224
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:07,509
the, or the responses or answers
that you get are just misleading.

225
00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:10,569
It's happened a lot at this point,
but that's the idea to train the

226
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:13,159
model to, to get better results.

227
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:17,929
So it's, it's going to, I mean,
under the hood is, is a, is a

228
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:20,049
model that we need to train.

229
00:17:20,504 --> 00:17:25,264
So, so the data quality
is, is, is important.

230
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:29,804
So, so it's, it's, that's where
I say that it's a long journey.

231
00:17:29,864 --> 00:17:33,424
We are going to train these,
these models to get better

232
00:17:33,424 --> 00:17:35,094
information, better insights.

233
00:17:35,594 --> 00:17:38,444
So yeah, the integration
takes, takes time.

234
00:17:38,494 --> 00:17:43,834
So you have to, you know, to, to
play, to experiment and to spend some

235
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:47,494
time to get this, this advantage.

236
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:53,259
But at the end, and this is for
sure, you are going to see the, the,

237
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:59,259
the results of, of these practices
based on, or powered by AI, you know,

238
00:17:59,259 --> 00:18:05,119
like the increased deploy frequency,
reduced mean time to response, customer

239
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:08,039
satisfaction, change failure rate.

240
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:10,489
So, as I said, it's a long journey.

241
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:18,149
The maturity in DevOps, I mean, it's not
like the automation is not the purpose.

242
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:23,449
I mean, it's like a consequence of
implementing DevOps and DevOps with AI,

243
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:27,109
but achieving DevOps maturity is ongoing.

244
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:30,999
It's an ongoing journey that
requires commitment, patience and

245
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:36,269
willingness to adapt to the ever
evolving software delivery landscape.

246
00:18:36,769 --> 00:18:38,619
So be patient.

247
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:40,219
and that's it.

248
00:18:40,629 --> 00:18:42,059
I am going to be around here.

249
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:44,639

you can contact me, there

250
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:46,589
is my LinkedIn information.

251
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:48,329
So yeah.

252
00:18:48,689 --> 00:18:49,679
Thank you very much.

253
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:50,979
Bye.
