1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:00,860
Three.

2
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,730
And by professional, I'm a data
scientist and ai enthusiast, but more

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,459
importantly, a builder by the experience.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,650
For over the last two decades, I have
been deep in the trenches of data

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,960
battling on-prem like the bottlenecks
to navigating the cloud migrations.

6
00:00:19,155 --> 00:00:23,924
Implementing AI systems across
different industries and now exploring

7
00:00:24,074 --> 00:00:27,435
how quantum integr land and photonic.

8
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:33,675
Can unlock the dimensions of
computations we have only dreamed off.

9
00:00:33,735 --> 00:00:38,255
If you have ever struggled to get
faster insights from your data or

10
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:43,325
if you have watched AI models play
to due to compute constraints,

11
00:00:43,325 --> 00:00:45,545
this talk definitely is for you.

12
00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:49,805
I'm going to walk through the real
world quantum algorithm, not just as

13
00:00:49,805 --> 00:00:54,785
a mathematical novelties, but as a
game changer, as a game-changing tool.

14
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:59,475
Of it for a problem solving
optimization and innovations.

15
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:05,300
Will it a technical yes, but
it'll also be human because behind

16
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,610
every algorithm is a decision.

17
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,150
And behind every decision is submission.

18
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,650
Let's equal that together.

19
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,660
And by end of this session you will
definitely walk away with a foundational

20
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,460
understanding of quantum computing
insights into the real world business

21
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,980
cases, and clarity on where this.

22
00:01:24,115 --> 00:01:27,445
Field is headed to, and how
can you be the product of?

23
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:32,445
So now I little bit discuss about myself
and you know a bit about me and let's

24
00:01:32,445 --> 00:01:36,525
talk about what are you going to walk
away with in this next 30 minutes.

25
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:40,785
I'm not here to throw a kind of
like a expertise jargon on you.

26
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:45,395
My goal is to make sure that every
person who is watching this, whether

27
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:49,085
you are a researcher, you're a cloud
architecture product leader, or just

28
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:51,275
a quantum curious walk away with.

29
00:01:51,305 --> 00:01:54,245
Something actionable and understandable.

30
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:59,794
You will grasp how quantum computing
truly differs from the classical systems

31
00:02:00,035 --> 00:02:02,794
and what make quantum logic so powerful.

32
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:06,335
We will break down
Shor's algorithm growers.

33
00:02:06,755 --> 00:02:11,804
Search and near hybrid approaches,
and you will actually see in the

34
00:02:11,804 --> 00:02:15,344
production today, and from drug
discovery to fraud detection.

35
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:20,444
I will share with where quantum
is already being piloted and where

36
00:02:20,504 --> 00:02:23,344
is headed because yes, some of.

37
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:28,230
Or what you hear out there is
hype, but a lot is a real, we will

38
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,390
distinguish fact from the fiction.

39
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,200
So you don't need to be a
quantum expert to get this.

40
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,159
You just need to be curious and
open, and if you are, I promise

41
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,989
that you will leave this session 10
steps ahead of where you started.

42
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:47,639
The greatest enemy of the
knowledge is not ignorance.

43
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:50,339
It is that illusion of knowledge.

44
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:53,189
I love this code from Stephen Hawing.

45
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,799
And Stephen Hawing is now just
about talking about the science.

46
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:00,349
He was talking about human nature.

47
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:06,559
We stop asking questions when we think
we are, already know the answer, and that

48
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:09,799
mindset has held back technology for that.

49
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,100
Okay.

50
00:03:10,339 --> 00:03:16,100
Most of us have grown up believing
that all computers work the same way.

51
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,184
We process ones and zeros.

52
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,869
They follow instructions and
with more speed and memory,

53
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,790
they solve the bigger problems.

54
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:31,390
That model called Non Newman
architecture invented in 1940s has

55
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:35,769
taken us from floppies to the cloud
computing and is the foundation of.

56
00:03:35,779 --> 00:03:41,209
Everything they use today, your
phone, your laptop, even I models.

57
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,480
But there is a cache.

58
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,800
It has limits.

59
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,650
And we have started to
hit those limits now.

60
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,890
And nature doesn't
compute in ones and zeros.

61
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,180
Nature is messy.

62
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,020
Probably stick nonlinear
at the atomic level there.

63
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,820
Things are not just on and off.

64
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,930
They exist in multiple states at once.

65
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,580
They influence each other without
touching, and they behave in

66
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:09,080
ways that seems irrational,
but are deeply mathematical.

67
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:15,110
So that to stimulate the nature to
model a molecule or understanding

68
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,580
quantum physics or solve the
certain optimization problems, we

69
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,550
can't keep using classical logic.

70
00:04:23,205 --> 00:04:26,445
That trying to paint
the ocean with a pencil.

71
00:04:26,535 --> 00:04:32,675
In, in, in 2019, world Quantum processor,
smore performed a computational

72
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:38,265
computation called random circuit
Sampling is not just a useful problem.

73
00:04:38,265 --> 00:04:42,630
It is extremely hard for classic
computers Second, or solve it in.

74
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,020
In a 200 seconds, IBM argued their
classical supercomputer could

75
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,640
have done in two per five days.

76
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,060
But even that is a stack difference,
whether it was 200 seconds or 2,

77
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,910
2, 2 days versus 10,000 years, that
the point is classical computing

78
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,490
is not always the fastest tool.

79
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,950
Sometimes it's not even
the right tool as well.

80
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,240
So its quantum computing does not
replace the classic old computers.

81
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,480
It.

82
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:12,150
It compliments them by solving a
new class of problems that rely

83
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,530
on principles like superposition,
entanglement, and interference.

84
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,500
That's what we will explore today, what
quantum algorithms are, why they matter,

85
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:26,845
where they are being used, and how they
will change everything from crypto.

86
00:05:27,635 --> 00:05:29,675
To the chemistry to ai.

87
00:05:29,855 --> 00:05:35,735
So let's first understand from the ground
up, what makes quantum computing different

88
00:05:36,005 --> 00:05:39,095
and why Everyone from IBM to nasa, I.

89
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,230
To startups like Zendo in
investing in this space.

90
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,330
Let's start with a simple
classical computer, like a phone

91
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:51,470
in your pocket or a server In the
cloud is a built on bits, right?

92
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:56,450
Each bits hold a value, either
zero or one, just two options

93
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,640
just like a live switch.

94
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,410
So it's either on or off.

95
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,120
This is the digital logic.

96
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,560
We have used since every
program, every video.

97
00:06:04,595 --> 00:06:12,275
Every AI model made of billions of those
switches flipping on and off really fast.

98
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:16,360
But the quantum computers use
qubits, which is quantum bit.

99
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:22,590
And these behave very differently instead
of just being zero and one A can be both.

100
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,120
Both at the same time.

101
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,760
And this is called superposition.

102
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,920
It's like a spin point, whether
it's in the air or it's not head.

103
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,570
Not tails, but it's both.

104
00:06:33,755 --> 00:06:37,355
Only when you measure it
does collapse into one.

105
00:06:37,555 --> 00:06:41,095
Now imagine like you had two
spinning points in front of you,

106
00:06:41,185 --> 00:06:43,675
but they are somehow entangled.

107
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:49,425
Meaning whatever outcome you get, no
one will instantly affect the others

108
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:52,005
no matter how far apart they are.

109
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:56,270
Einstein called this spooky
action at a distance, and this

110
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,580
is the magic of entanglement.

111
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:04,220
When you combine superposition and
entanglement, you can represent

112
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,890
and process many states at once.

113
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:12,365
A classical bait gives you one calculation
at a time, but in quantum based.

114
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,780
Cubits can represent
two possibility at once.

115
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:22,870
So that means two cubits, four state,
three cubits, eight and 10 cubits

116
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:28,750
already over 1,300 cubits, more
state at the au atom in the universe.

117
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,705
So now to be clear,
this is not just magic.

118
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,330
You still have to run a smart
algorithm to extract the right answer.

119
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,330
You don't just get all
the answer for free.

120
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:44,185
Quantum computing is not
about doing everything faster.

121
00:07:44,515 --> 00:07:48,205
It's about doing certain
problems differently.

122
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:54,175
Problems like factoring factoring
massive numbers, simulating molecules,

123
00:07:54,235 --> 00:07:57,135
optimizing delivery rules or training.

124
00:07:57,195 --> 00:07:58,905
Quantum enhanced AI models.

125
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:00,515
Where the solution space is.

126
00:08:00,515 --> 00:08:03,455
So vast classical machines hit evolve.

127
00:08:03,485 --> 00:08:08,045
So classical computers is like
walking through every hallway

128
00:08:08,075 --> 00:08:10,805
in a giant means, one at a time.

129
00:08:11,045 --> 00:08:17,525
Quantum computing is like entering all the
hallways at once, but using interference.

130
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:22,320
Veterans to cancel out the wrong
paths and amplify the right ones.

131
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:27,630
The key concepts to remember are here
in this specific slide is superposition.

132
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,360
Abit can be many things at once.

133
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:33,255
In second is ments.

134
00:08:33,255 --> 00:08:36,225
Keywords can build link beyond the space.

135
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:42,775
And number three is interference which
is used to find useful answer from noise.

136
00:08:42,804 --> 00:08:47,755
So with these two quantum computer,
don't just calculate the explore.

137
00:08:47,785 --> 00:08:51,025
Now let's go to the next slide,
which is a quantum advantage.

138
00:08:51,055 --> 00:08:55,344
That, so that, now that we understand
what makes quantum computing different,

139
00:08:55,614 --> 00:09:00,025
the real question is whether or
where does it matter what problems?

140
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:03,199
Actually solve better than
the classical computer.

141
00:09:03,469 --> 00:09:07,519
The term we use is quantum advantage,
which means that quantum computing

142
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,389
solving problem faster or more
efficiently than the best classic

143
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:13,939
com computer supercomputer ever can.

144
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:17,270
So even with the unlimited time
and the memory there is not.

145
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:22,520
Theoretical in 2019, Google claimed that
quantum advantage for the first time

146
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,250
using a random circle sampling task.

147
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,079
While the usefulness of the task
was debated, the milestone was

148
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:31,669
clear for their specific problem.

149
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,829
Google computers simply couldn't keep up.

150
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,319
And let me break it down.

151
00:09:35,319 --> 00:09:38,919
Like simulation of those quantum
systems and nature itself is a quantum.

152
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:43,809
So if we, if you want to simulate
in atoms, molecules, or materials

153
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,249
using plastic computers is like
translating poetry with a calculator.

154
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:52,060
So quantum computers are built
on the same physics, so they can

155
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:56,939
actually naturally simulate chemical
interactions, energy steers, and the

156
00:09:56,939 --> 00:10:01,310
molecule bonding things that require
approximations on classical machines.

157
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,840
This has a huge implications for drug
discovery, material designs, and even

158
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,880
the sustainable energy development.

159
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:13,400
These show up and these shows up
everywhere, logistics, finance, traffic

160
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,330
systems, and even from machine learning,
hyper parameter tuning as well.

161
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,280
Classical servers like linear
programming are logistic are fast,

162
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:27,260
but they often hit the local minimal
or something that will limit not the

163
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,180
best solution, just a nearby one.

164
00:10:29,355 --> 00:10:35,895
So quantum algorithms like the quantum
RO made optimization algorithm, which is

165
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:44,495
qa OA expo exponent exponentially more
options in parallel in offer offering

166
00:10:44,495 --> 00:10:51,064
a global solution ensures algorithm
is developed in 1994 is perhaps one

167
00:10:51,064 --> 00:10:53,735
of the most famous quantum algorithm.

168
00:10:53,795 --> 00:10:55,805
It can factor large numbers at.

169
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,400
Exponentially faster than
the classical matters.

170
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,780
And why does that matter?

171
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:05,310
Because modern encryptions like
RSA is based on the assumption

172
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,530
that a factoring is hard.

173
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,270
If large scale quantum machines becomes
practical, encryption will break.

174
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,339
This is why we now talk about post quantum
cryptography, which is already atop.

175
00:11:17,749 --> 00:11:20,499
Top priority for the
national security as well.

176
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:25,089
And it's very important to clarify that
quantum computer want replace everything.

177
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:29,049
It is not going to run your
Excel spreadsheet faster or

178
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:31,389
replace your phone's processor.

179
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:36,219
It shines very specific domains
problems where the search engines

180
00:11:36,219 --> 00:11:41,509
grows exponentially or where Quantum
Interference gives it is unique.

181
00:11:41,555 --> 00:11:42,905
Computational edge.

182
00:11:42,964 --> 00:11:47,734
Think about searching a for a needle
in a haystack, a classical computer

183
00:11:47,734 --> 00:11:49,834
is checked each straw one by one.

184
00:11:50,015 --> 00:11:55,004
A quantum computer use uses growers
algorithm to search the entire block

185
00:11:55,185 --> 00:11:59,650
or entire haystack in secure route
time which means like problem within

186
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:05,229
million possibilities can be solved in
about 1000 steps instead of million.

187
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,014
That's not just a speed, but that is
about, you can say, a new kind of a like.

188
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:14,119
Formula Quantum A is not universal,
but it iss a profound when applied

189
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:18,439
to the right kinds of problems
As simulation, optimization and

190
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:23,179
cryptography, quantum computer don't
just offer performance boost, they

191
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:26,489
offer is the only feasible path forward.

192
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:28,019
Nowness, I will walk you through.

193
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,719
A compute quantum of computer
in didn't just appear overnight.

194
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:34,409
It's a product of the DA
Deckers of theory Physics.

195
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:35,449
And engineering.

196
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:40,369
Many of them are initially dis
dismissed as impossible or just math.

197
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,599
But here we are.

198
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:45,419
Just a little bit of a history
in 1981, this all started

199
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:47,369
from a physicist, Richard.

200
00:12:47,404 --> 00:12:52,444
Famous man who asked a simple
question in 1981, why can't we

201
00:12:52,444 --> 00:12:54,964
simulate physics on a computer?

202
00:12:55,054 --> 00:12:59,374
His answer, because computers are
not built on the law of physics.

203
00:12:59,374 --> 00:13:04,474
But if we could build a computer
that behaves quantum mechanically,

204
00:13:04,594 --> 00:13:06,799
he could simulate nature itself.

205
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,054
And this was a seed and it
launched a whole new field.

206
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:13,104
Then came the major shockwave in 1994.

207
00:13:13,164 --> 00:13:14,694
Peter Shaw at Dell Labs.

208
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:20,030
Created an algorithm that could factor the
large number of exp expon exponentially

209
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,280
faster than any classical algorithm.

210
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:26,660
And this was not just a math
breakthrough, it was a direct threat

211
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,489
to the security of the internet.

212
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:32,390
Suddenly quantum computing
become not only a curiosity,

213
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,430
but a strategy priority as well.

214
00:13:34,489 --> 00:13:38,540
Then love grower at Bell Labs,
develop an algorithm that will

215
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,520
search and sort databases in.

216
00:13:40,744 --> 00:13:41,764
Scale route time.

217
00:13:41,974 --> 00:13:47,064
This may not sound dramatic but in
the computer science going from ON

218
00:13:47,064 --> 00:13:52,194
to the O scale route and is huge,
especially when n is in the billions.

219
00:13:52,254 --> 00:13:55,794
So truly the early the field
shifted from the theory.

220
00:13:55,994 --> 00:14:00,435
To hardware IBM, Intel and
Startups like D-Wave began

221
00:14:00,435 --> 00:14:02,234
building actual quantum chips.

222
00:14:02,264 --> 00:14:05,214
But they were spec, they were
like a skeptics, like the

223
00:14:05,214 --> 00:14:07,254
main challenge was CIC agile.

224
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:12,085
They decor easily, even a breeze of
temperature or vibration can corrupt them.

225
00:14:12,325 --> 00:14:16,725
So in 2019 will steam, published
a paper claiming that they have

226
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:20,745
achieved quantum supremacy, meaning
that their quantum processor solved

227
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:24,675
a problem that would practically
impossible for a classic computer.

228
00:14:24,735 --> 00:14:28,305
While the use case was narrow,
random circuit sampling

229
00:14:28,425 --> 00:14:30,255
industry milestone was massive.

230
00:14:30,314 --> 00:14:32,775
It, it validated the deckers of the world.

231
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:36,615
So in less than four years, we have
grown from chalkboard theories.

232
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:40,729
Two functional computers processes
and that lightning speed compared to

233
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:42,499
the history of the classic computer.

234
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,840
But remember, we are still early.

235
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:49,720
We are in the NI SQ era where it's
called NOIs Intermediary Scale quantum.

236
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:54,620
The chip exists, but they are error
pro and small and still the pace

237
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,459
is accelerating really fast Now
now that we know about the quantum

238
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,119
computing team from let's look at
the algorithms that are turning this

239
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:04,425
theory into the real world impact.

240
00:15:04,675 --> 00:15:07,225
And let's, okay, a few on algorithms.

241
00:15:07,225 --> 00:15:09,845
The ones so you have
seen how many algorithms?

242
00:15:09,845 --> 00:15:11,435
One is we have already discussed.

243
00:15:11,505 --> 00:15:13,065
One is the hor algorithm.

244
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:17,055
In 1994, this one cracked the word
open Shor algorithm factors the

245
00:15:17,055 --> 00:15:21,285
large intes exponentially faster
than the classical computer.

246
00:15:21,285 --> 00:15:21,915
And why care?

247
00:15:22,245 --> 00:15:24,855
'cause that's how RSA encryption works.

248
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,770
The backbone of the internet security
and if quantum computer, with enough

249
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:34,830
stable qubit sixes, it would break RSA
to 2048 in the days, while classical

250
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,660
computers will take millions of years.

251
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,290
So that's why governments are now
investing in post quantum encryption.

252
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:44,450
And then 1996 of growers algorithms
search a un sort data database.

253
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,320
It's like secure N times
instead of n. That's a quad.

254
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:53,680
Quad speed up there was like quad ready,
speed up and in the fields like machine

255
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,110
learning or bioinformatic, this can
save a number of years in competition.

256
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,030
Quantum approximate optimization
algorithm QA oh eight is a

257
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,200
hybrid algorithm is planned.

258
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,820
The classic classical and quantum
processing rate for the real

259
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,480
world optimization tasks like
the be routing and network.

260
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,900
De balancing and even the
financial financial mining as well.

261
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:21,020
Vibration quantum, which is VQE, is used
in the quantum industry, is estimates the

262
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,570
ground, state or energy of the molecules.

263
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,590
That means faster drug designs,
material innovation, and even

264
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,270
sustainable energy discovery.

265
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,040
So there are not sci-fi ideas.

266
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,870
They are already being tested on
IBM ion q Extendo, and others.

267
00:16:36,885 --> 00:16:37,515
Quantum metal.

268
00:16:37,515 --> 00:16:40,935
We don't want replace classical one
at all, but they will just unlock

269
00:16:40,965 --> 00:16:43,130
what classical core cannot reach.

270
00:16:44,115 --> 00:16:47,205
Use cases that, how is quantum
computing being used right now?

271
00:16:47,265 --> 00:16:51,275
Let's look at some few sectors
that are not just experimenting,

272
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,985
but they're investing as well.

273
00:16:53,015 --> 00:16:56,945
One of the companies like pharmaceutical
company, Roche and AstraZenca,

274
00:16:57,155 --> 00:17:01,625
are partnering with a quantum
startups to simulate molecules and

275
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:05,930
predict protein folding something
classical computer can do at scale.

276
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:10,625
Quantum help identify drug
viable drug candidates faster.

277
00:17:10,695 --> 00:17:15,945
Potential, say billions in r and d and
speed speeding up the time to market.

278
00:17:15,945 --> 00:17:19,815
In finance industry firms like
Goldman SaaS and JP Morgan Chase are

279
00:17:19,815 --> 00:17:25,065
exploring Quantum for optimizing the
answers portfolios and running Monte

280
00:17:25,065 --> 00:17:27,255
Carlo simulation more efficiently.

281
00:17:27,315 --> 00:17:30,675
These problem have expo
exponential complexity.

282
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,140
Quantum algorithms offer a better
way to explore risk scenarios

283
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,850
and logistics and supply chain.

284
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,840
Volkswagen and DHL are testing
quantum systems for traffic flow

285
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,980
optimization and road planning,
especially where classical computer

286
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,260
or classical systems get overwhelmed.

287
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,840
By too many variables.

288
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,590
The even one minute of save time
per vehicle can scale into millions

289
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,420
in the savings in energy sector.

290
00:17:54,450 --> 00:18:00,000
ExxonMobil and BASF exploring the
quantum chemistry to discover better

291
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,460
catalyst for cleaner fuel production
and energy storage can simulate chemical

292
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,440
reactions that will take classical
supercomputers centuries to approximate.

293
00:18:10,745 --> 00:18:15,245
Quantum computing is already
used in narrow high impact tasks.

294
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:19,765
Not to run your website but to reshape
definitely r and d, your supply

295
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,715
chain and your competitive edge.

296
00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:25,975
Most of the quantum computers used
today, superconducting, cubics.

297
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:31,285
The tiny electrical circles cool
to near absolute zero, but there is

298
00:18:31,285 --> 00:18:35,545
another approach gaining traction is
called photo toning quantum computing.

299
00:18:35,755 --> 00:18:39,625
So instead of electrons
or ions, it's use photons.

300
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,800
Practic, there was a kind
of like particles of light

301
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,600
to represent the qubits.

302
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,670
Photons are naturally quantum.

303
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,750
They do not interact with their
environment easily, which means

304
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,320
they are less prone to noise or
any kind of like decoherence.

305
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,550
So one of the biggest challenge in
quantum hardware is like that un

306
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:01,340
unlike superconducting cubs for Tony.

307
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,710
Can operate at room temperature
and use existing fiber optical

308
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,700
infrastructure as well.

309
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,100
And the same tech in our internet cables.

310
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:14,710
So pump is x do in Canada and PSI
Quantum, which is in the US and UK, are

311
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:19,730
building the full scale quantum processor
based on the photo photon photonic.

312
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,685
Nic Alexander's Boreal
system was the first.

313
00:19:23,165 --> 00:19:26,985
Photonic quantum computer to
demonstrate the sampling of the scale.

314
00:19:27,075 --> 00:19:29,715
And this is very specific,
very hard problem.

315
00:19:29,765 --> 00:19:34,555
But it proved that that photonic chip
can are not just theoretical, but

316
00:19:34,555 --> 00:19:36,295
it's extremely practical as well.

317
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:38,475
But it still face some challenges.

318
00:19:38,505 --> 00:19:43,485
Generating and manipulating single
photons reli reliably is really tough.

319
00:19:43,795 --> 00:19:48,065
And building logic gates using
light alone is not as mature

320
00:19:48,065 --> 00:19:50,165
as superconducting tech yet.

321
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:54,965
So if we crack scalable photonic
compute quantum com, we get faster,

322
00:19:54,965 --> 00:19:59,395
cheaper, and most robust quantum
systems, and we can build them using

323
00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:01,050
the same optical com components.

324
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,060
Already mass produced today.

325
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,390
And now let's talk about what
quantum computing can't you yet,

326
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:10,860
because we are still very in early
in any innings of this field.

327
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,780
Cubis are very fragile.

328
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,750
They lose their quantum
state within microseconds.

329
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,730
It is, this is called decoherence.

330
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:22,270
So even the tiniest heat or for
the vibration can throw them off.

331
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,360
This is why Quantum error correction
is one of the biggest bottleneck.

332
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:30,430
To get one reliable, logical curate,
you might need hundreds or even

333
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,500
thousands of the physical curate.

334
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,910
Today, quantum computers are called
some of the devices, which is noise

335
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,290
and power tolerance is missed.

336
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,740
Devices, noisy, intermediate
scale, quantum they work, they

337
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,990
are not fully far tolerance yet.

338
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:48,070
You can run small experiments, but
scaling them is still a hurdle.

339
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,280
Super connecting systems
can need extreme cooling.

340
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,990
Trapped I is needed trapped s lasers.

341
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,610
Photonic chips needs
precise light control.

342
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,050
And all these platforms have
strengths, but no one has

343
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,680
solved the scale challenge yet.

344
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,130
So most fundamental with them
today are still explore theory

345
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,270
but for many real word problems.

346
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:14,659
We haven't yet proven a quantum solution
that is truly better than the classical.

347
00:21:14,665 --> 00:21:17,479
So there are there are,
there is also a high bubble.

348
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:21,049
Some companies make quantum solutions
that are not quantum at all.

349
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:24,919
As researchers and builders we have
to separate the science from the pr.

350
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,669
So yes, the potential is massive,
but we are not there yet.

351
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:31,489
We are not in the charge g PT
moment of quantum computing,

352
00:21:31,489 --> 00:21:33,439
but this is a D tech field.

353
00:21:33,489 --> 00:21:35,889
It's not just a finished
product and that's okay.

354
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:36,689
Is the internet.

355
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:39,869
To doctors as well, to to
come into the production.

356
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:42,209
So now we have to talk where we are today.

357
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:44,059
Now so where exactly are we?

358
00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:44,989
Quantum roadmap?

359
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:48,079
The answer is early,
but accelerating fast.

360
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:52,719
So we are in NISQ era, which is a
noisy, intermediate scale quantum.

361
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:55,479
This means that we have real
machines, but they are noisy,

362
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:57,739
limited in the scale and not hot.

363
00:21:58,334 --> 00:21:59,174
Torrance yet.

364
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:02,564
So not enough for full
cryptographic breakthroughs, but

365
00:22:02,804 --> 00:22:04,574
enough for the experimentation.

366
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:07,934
Hybrid models and early
optimization trials.

367
00:22:08,024 --> 00:22:09,584
There was a commercial pilots alive.

368
00:22:09,584 --> 00:22:14,354
Big pharma like the pharma, finance
and logistics are running parallel or

369
00:22:14,354 --> 00:22:17,394
limited powers to test world viability.

370
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,664
And then we are probably five
to 10 years from full scales

371
00:22:20,694 --> 00:22:22,314
for orange quantum system.

372
00:22:22,344 --> 00:22:27,144
But if you wait until then to start,
you will be too late in this race.

373
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:30,904
Now the quantum hardware landscape,
let's quickly talk about what's

374
00:22:30,904 --> 00:22:34,954
under the hood, because not all the
quantum computers are built the same.

375
00:22:34,984 --> 00:22:37,804
There are four main types of
the quantum hardware platform.

376
00:22:38,104 --> 00:22:42,064
Number one is superconducting
qubits, which is used by IBM, Google.

377
00:22:42,244 --> 00:22:47,584
They are fast but extreme but extreme
cooling for the near term you can say.

378
00:22:47,984 --> 00:22:48,524
Experiment.

379
00:22:48,554 --> 00:22:53,684
Then we have a second tab is a trapped
ion, which is used by Iron Q in Honeywell.

380
00:22:53,744 --> 00:22:56,714
More stable and precise,
but slower GA speed.

381
00:22:56,784 --> 00:23:01,584
Then we have for Tony quantum computers
like X extendo, A PSI, quantum, it's

382
00:23:01,584 --> 00:23:05,694
leveraged the light room temperature,
great long term scalability.

383
00:23:05,814 --> 00:23:09,744
Then we have neutral atoms
and topological qubits.

384
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:12,434
Used by QRL and Microsoft.

385
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:16,034
Still early stage, but
promising for error resistance.

386
00:23:16,034 --> 00:23:20,924
So the race is not just over, we just
don't know which architecture will win,

387
00:23:20,924 --> 00:23:25,244
but the diversity of the approaches
is what make this space so dynamic.

388
00:23:25,624 --> 00:23:28,474
Here is what I will just
a little bit about that.

389
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:30,634
Where is still heading in
the next five to 10 years?

390
00:23:30,664 --> 00:23:31,444
Let's break it down.

391
00:23:31,534 --> 00:23:33,994
So by 25, 22, 28.

392
00:23:33,994 --> 00:23:36,904
And then SQ maturity is that more stable?

393
00:23:36,934 --> 00:23:42,394
Ubes Hybrid quantum classical models
become common in r and d environments.

394
00:23:42,734 --> 00:23:49,544
From 2028 to 2023 to 32 error bracket
quantum computers, we will likely see

395
00:23:49,544 --> 00:23:54,704
the first 1000 plus large cubit system
capable of be beating classical in

396
00:23:54,704 --> 00:24:00,054
real production and post 2032 quantum
integration into cloud ecosystem, which

397
00:24:00,054 --> 00:24:05,634
will be like quantum will become a service
embedded into AI and analytical stats.

398
00:24:05,734 --> 00:24:09,364
And you will call it from an
API or like any other tool.

399
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:14,134
So we are moving from lab experimenting
to infrastructure grade tools like ai.

400
00:24:14,134 --> 00:24:18,304
The winner won't just be like
those who build the tag, but those

401
00:24:18,304 --> 00:24:19,684
who learn how to apply it early.

402
00:24:20,074 --> 00:24:24,274
You don't need a PhD in physics to start
building quantum application today.

403
00:24:24,274 --> 00:24:25,694
There are, these are tools.

404
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:29,224
Many are free and I'll let you experiment
right now in the cloud as well.

405
00:24:29,274 --> 00:24:33,094
One is what I. Personally use as
well is IBM, which is a Python

406
00:24:33,094 --> 00:24:36,734
based open source and back with
a real hardware on the IBM Cloud.

407
00:24:37,584 --> 00:24:41,364
IBM, quantum Cloud, and
then we have a Google CIRQ.

408
00:24:41,424 --> 00:24:45,114
Great for the NS algorithms,
especially the quantum circuits.

409
00:24:45,324 --> 00:24:49,884
Microsoft Q Hash as Azure Quantum,
which is built for the hybrid

410
00:24:49,914 --> 00:24:51,984
quantum classical workflows.

411
00:24:51,984 --> 00:24:54,894
Then we have a Amazon bracket
native is connected to the

412
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:56,424
multiple hardware brackets.

413
00:24:56,424 --> 00:24:58,824
IQ Rage, JT and Fops Ford.

414
00:24:58,854 --> 00:25:02,389
And then we have a x. Spanning lane,
which is focused on the quantum

415
00:25:02,389 --> 00:25:06,739
machine learning, integrates well
with the PyTorch and the tensor flow.

416
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:10,669
And whether the Azure data scientist
developer, or just curious you

417
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:13,519
can access the real quantum
hardware from your act today.

418
00:25:13,569 --> 00:25:18,699
And I will say here's what I want to walk
away with today in three clear takeaways.

419
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:20,229
Quantum is not magic.

420
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:24,699
It's a math plus physics and
engineering and a blend of ai,

421
00:25:24,819 --> 00:25:26,859
but it change what's possible.

422
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:27,899
Problems.

423
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:31,679
We thought unsolved people
are now being modeled.

424
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:34,079
We are still early, but not too early.

425
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:37,139
You don't have to wait for
perfection to get involved.

426
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:39,509
The learning curve has already begun.

427
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:43,979
The future will be hybrid, classical
and quantum AI and physics.

428
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,269
Quote and light.

429
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:48,749
And those who cannot connect,
those words will definitely

430
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,849
need now to start work on that.

431
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:54,539
Because if you connect these all doors
together today, that you will definitely,

432
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:56,639
there will high chances of leading.

433
00:25:56,699 --> 00:26:00,889
And if there is one thing I hope this
talk did is I hope that give, that

434
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:05,449
this give you clarity, not confusion
and curiosity, not kind a fear.

435
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:06,959
And most importantly, a recent.

436
00:26:07,144 --> 00:26:07,954
As well.

437
00:26:08,014 --> 00:26:11,864
Thank you so much for your time and
your patience, and thank you all.

438
00:26:11,924 --> 00:26:12,824
Thank you for being here.

439
00:26:12,824 --> 00:26:13,274
Truly.

440
00:26:13,274 --> 00:26:17,414
I know this is a complex topic, but the
fact that you showed up tells tell me

441
00:26:17,414 --> 00:26:19,334
that you're not afraid of the complexity.

442
00:26:19,574 --> 00:26:22,484
You are here to lead the
future, not just wait for it.

443
00:26:22,754 --> 00:26:26,264
So if to spark any kind of
ideas, a question or even

444
00:26:26,264 --> 00:26:27,924
doubts let's stay connected.

445
00:26:27,984 --> 00:26:30,324
I share a lot on LinkedIn and I love.

446
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:35,599
Stalking shop, whether it's quantum ai,
data architecture, cryptocurrency, or

447
00:26:35,629 --> 00:26:38,149
blockchain or wherever is converging.

448
00:26:38,149 --> 00:26:41,779
So you can find me in the
Sara Chori or directly as well

449
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:43,219
from the LinkedIn messages.

450
00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:45,869
And you can check me on
link Trace slash Sara Chori.

451
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:49,599
Quantum computing is not
just about faster answers.

452
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:52,374
It's not is about asking the
deeper questions and that's

453
00:26:52,374 --> 00:26:54,174
where the transformation begins.

454
00:26:54,204 --> 00:26:55,284
Thank you very much.
