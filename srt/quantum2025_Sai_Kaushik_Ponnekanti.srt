1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
hi everyone.

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,319
I'm Sai.

3
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,450
K. It's a pleasure to be here at the
conference 42 to share what I've learned

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,950
about the quantum computing today.

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,320
So when I first began exploring this
field, I vividly recall reading a paper

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:20,319
that described quantum speedups as almost
magical science, like fiction made real, I

7
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:24,490
felt excitement, mingled with skepticism,
of course, like who won't, right?

8
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:27,955
Could these fragile devices
truly deliver the things that

9
00:00:27,955 --> 00:00:29,634
they're promising over time?

10
00:00:29,634 --> 00:00:32,905
Small experiments convinced me
there is substance beneath the hype.

11
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:38,724
Today we live in a Nisc era where hardware
remains imperfect, but already offers

12
00:00:38,724 --> 00:00:40,974
tangible benefits in scoped problems.

13
00:00:41,485 --> 00:00:44,065
Over the next 20 to 30 minutes,
I'll guide you through where we

14
00:00:44,065 --> 00:00:49,165
stand, why quantum matters, concrete
examples in the industry, and how

15
00:00:49,165 --> 00:00:50,635
to prepare for what lies ahead.

16
00:00:51,074 --> 00:00:55,035
Let's begin by setting the scene and
revisiting how we have arrived here

17
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,705
and why even early experiments matter.

18
00:00:58,514 --> 00:01:00,855
So let's actually move on
to where we stand today.

19
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:02,924
What is the current quantum
computing landscape?

20
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:08,574
So classical computing has driven
incredible advances in smartphones,

21
00:01:08,574 --> 00:01:12,505
cloud services, machine learning, but
certain challenges grow exponentially

22
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:13,794
harder as scale increases.

23
00:01:14,155 --> 00:01:17,414
For example, the traveling salesman
problem, of course, who doesn't

24
00:01:17,414 --> 00:01:18,884
remember the traveling salesman problem?

25
00:01:19,184 --> 00:01:21,164
When you're reading about computer
science, this is one of the

26
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,864
most head scratching problems
that one has read about, right?

27
00:01:24,314 --> 00:01:26,534
So with a few cities,
of course it's trivial.

28
00:01:26,534 --> 00:01:29,834
Let's say take an example of two to
three cities, it's not as hard, but

29
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:31,544
as you add more and more cities.

30
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:36,229
Possibilities, literally explode
our molecular simulations, modeling

31
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:40,459
electron interactions in even
moderately sized molecules can quickly,

32
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:43,639
overall, because of the sheer number
of electrons, and frankly speaking

33
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,420
how they interact with each other.

34
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,470
Quantum computing introduces
superposition and entanglement.

35
00:01:49,785 --> 00:01:54,195
Letting us explore many
possibilities in parallel and capture

36
00:01:54,255 --> 00:01:56,835
correlations beyond classical reach.

37
00:01:57,315 --> 00:01:59,360
So which is exactly where we what we want.

38
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:05,690
And in today's NSC hardware, we have
10 to low hundreds of qubits, noisy

39
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,790
operations, and limited coherence times.

40
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:13,320
Despite these constraints creative
algorithms and hybrid workflows often

41
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,079
yield advantages on scoped problems.

42
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:18,750
Again, as I said, the
problems need to be scoped.

43
00:02:19,404 --> 00:02:23,635
I remember a pilot where a small
team simulated a simple molecule.

44
00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:26,545
Raw hardware results were very noisy.

45
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:30,355
Yet after combining with
classical approximations and error

46
00:02:30,355 --> 00:02:33,894
mitigation, they guided a chemist
away from a costly lab test.

47
00:02:33,894 --> 00:02:37,894
Of course, we cannot afford to
make expensive mistakes these days

48
00:02:37,894 --> 00:02:40,769
with so much technology available,
and as such, these things matter.

49
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:46,084
That success, even though felt modest,
a fraction of a larger pipeline, but it

50
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:47,944
actually built to confidence and skills.

51
00:02:48,454 --> 00:02:51,094
Understanding this context
prevents over hype.

52
00:02:51,574 --> 00:02:57,234
We pursue quantum even because even
small wins now build expertise and

53
00:02:57,234 --> 00:02:59,064
position us for larger breakthroughs.

54
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:02,124
Of course, this is exactly how Industrial
Revolution started as well, right?

55
00:03:02,634 --> 00:03:05,564
So think of it like learning
how you, how you set to sail.

56
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:09,524
You start with a small boat
in a calm, open waters before

57
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:10,844
you tackle the open ocean.

58
00:03:11,484 --> 00:03:16,614
Now let's actually dive deep into the
core quantum principles in practice.

59
00:03:17,094 --> 00:03:21,464
So at the heart of the quantum advantage
lies superposition and entanglement.

60
00:03:22,094 --> 00:03:26,804
So again, like as you can see, basically
there are, there's a lot of jargon.

61
00:03:26,804 --> 00:03:30,364
And frankly speaking it gets overwhelming
when you're trying to learn new stuff.

62
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:31,509
Of course, I can understand.

63
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:33,189
So let's take a simple example.

64
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:36,189
Imagine spinning a coin until it lands.

65
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,499
You don't know whether
it is heads or tails.

66
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:44,879
Similarly, a qubit can hold both
possibilities simultaneously when qubits

67
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,669
entangle their states link, so that
measuring one affects the whole, allowing

68
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:57,179
representation of complex correlations,
classical bits cannot efficiently in code.

69
00:03:57,679 --> 00:04:02,539
So in practice, algorithms like quantum
approximation optimization, world

70
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,809
optimization objective into a circuit.

71
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:11,139
The samples candidate solutions
though current devices are noisy,

72
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:15,369
running shallow circuits and
combining outputs with classical

73
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:20,949
post-processing can reveal better
solutions than classical heuristics.

74
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:22,884
I recall sitting in a meeting like where?

75
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:29,009
Engineers framed a logistics routing
problem on a quantum test, so they took

76
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:33,219
a region with about dozen stops encoded
cost functions into a variational

77
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,650
circuit and ran hardware experiments.

78
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:38,650
Raw outputs were super
noisy and inconsistent.

79
00:04:39,004 --> 00:04:42,934
But after collecting enough samples
and applying mitigation techniques

80
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:47,525
to mitigate the noise, they observed
candidate routes that classical

81
00:04:47,525 --> 00:04:50,075
solvers could not even recognize.

82
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:53,645
So they tested those routes
in a simulation and saw slight

83
00:04:53,645 --> 00:04:55,235
improvements in total travel time.

84
00:04:55,235 --> 00:04:58,905
Again, I don't want to exaggerate
the advantages that we got because

85
00:04:58,905 --> 00:05:01,004
these are small wins that we
are accounting for right now.

86
00:05:01,694 --> 00:05:05,234
It wasn't earth shattering as I was just
saying, but it demonstrated that quantum

87
00:05:05,234 --> 00:05:06,825
could contribute to something new.

88
00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:09,770
So again, it's a well-defined
slice of a problem.

89
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,099
As you can see, the variation, the
variables are defined, the scope is

90
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:14,659
defined, so and so on and so forth.

91
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:19,789
That practical doorway, identifying
a manageable priest that matters is

92
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:24,289
where n era value emerges because
we want to definitely make sure that

93
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,979
we are working with the classical
computing, but again we want to make

94
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:30,509
sure that we do slightly better.

95
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,505
Even if possible.

96
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:36,125
Now let's actually try to see how
do we work with n constraints.

97
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,854
What are the challenges that
we are, do we are finding, and

98
00:05:38,854 --> 00:05:40,114
how do we navigate around it?

99
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:45,635
So real hardware today isn't flawless
noise, corrupt calculations and qubit

100
00:05:45,635 --> 00:05:47,344
counts limit problem problem size.

101
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:51,004
Instead of seeing this purely as
a barrier, let's actually choose.

102
00:05:51,504 --> 00:05:53,604
Problems tailored to NIST machines.

103
00:05:53,964 --> 00:05:57,294
For example, small scale portfolio
optimization, simplified molecular

104
00:05:57,294 --> 00:06:01,684
models or routing sub-problems
in logistics fit within tens

105
00:06:01,684 --> 00:06:03,064
of qubits and shallow circuits.

106
00:06:03,064 --> 00:06:06,274
Again, you don't want to go into hundreds
of qubits because the, these are limited

107
00:06:06,274 --> 00:06:11,404
for no error mitigation techniques such
as zero noise, extrapolation or randomized

108
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:14,239
compiling help extract meaningful results.

109
00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:15,279
Despite noise.

110
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:19,569
I remember a team kind of running
the same circuit at different gate

111
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:25,329
durations to amplify noise and then
extrapolating data back toward a zero.

112
00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:25,959
Nice estimate.

113
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:30,219
Results aligned very close
to the classical benchmarks

114
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:31,509
than raw readings ever did.

115
00:06:32,109 --> 00:06:33,969
These steps require extra circuit trends.

116
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:38,629
Of course, you want to make sure
there are enough samples and basically

117
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,549
and classical computation, but.

118
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:44,039
Transforming noisy outputs
into actionable insights.

119
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,259
Hybrid workflows prove essential because
this is where I think, again, we don't

120
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:54,509
want to directly say either or that, so we
want to use a hybrid approach, classical

121
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,004
pre-assessing narrow candidate sets.

122
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,729
Once you can add narrow, the
candidate said quantum circuits

123
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:01,169
refine or evaluate them.

124
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:05,609
Classical post processing interprets
outputs a short list, a few dozen,

125
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:10,349
and then use quantum subin to
estimate energies more precisely

126
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:12,209
for that specific short list.

127
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:17,309
Guiding experimental decisions in
logistics are global routing problem might

128
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:20,099
be split into several regional slices.

129
00:07:20,344 --> 00:07:22,634
Classical solvers handle the broad layout.

130
00:07:23,174 --> 00:07:27,164
While quantum kind of pilots
refine the specific legs for

131
00:07:27,164 --> 00:07:28,364
each of these constraints.

132
00:07:28,784 --> 00:07:32,384
So embracing constraints creatively
is exactly what we are looking for.

133
00:07:32,924 --> 00:07:35,354
So now let's take a
couple of examples, right?

134
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:39,854
How do we handle quantum quantum computing
in the financial services landscape?

135
00:07:40,404 --> 00:07:45,084
In financial services optimization and
risk assessment draw very early interest

136
00:07:45,084 --> 00:07:47,604
because that is exactly what we look for.

137
00:07:47,664 --> 00:07:51,834
Whenever anybody speaks of financial
services, consider portfolio optimization.

138
00:07:52,334 --> 00:07:55,514
Classical solvers may take hours
or days for large portfolios.

139
00:07:55,904 --> 00:08:01,224
A quantum inspired ran mid-sized
instances faster, and suggested

140
00:08:01,224 --> 00:08:05,604
allocations that improved risk adjusted
returns modestly in pilot tests.

141
00:08:05,604 --> 00:08:07,344
Again, this is like purely pilot tests.

142
00:08:07,764 --> 00:08:11,334
In one case, a wealth management
firm defined a pilot with 30 to

143
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:14,964
40 assets integrating expected
returns and core variance data.

144
00:08:15,624 --> 00:08:19,194
They ran various circuits on
simulators and small hardware to

145
00:08:19,194 --> 00:08:23,734
sample candidate allocations, and then
compared them to classical solutions.

146
00:08:24,064 --> 00:08:28,054
The quantum assisted results sometime
offered slight shifts that went

147
00:08:28,054 --> 00:08:33,184
back tested, showed a few basis
points of improved sharp ratio.

148
00:08:33,904 --> 00:08:38,434
Those gains translate to meaningful
dollar value when assets under management

149
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,904
scale into hundreds of millions.

150
00:08:40,564 --> 00:08:43,234
So another area is a
Monte Carlo risk analysis.

151
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:48,079
Classical Monte Carlo may require millions
of samples to estimate tail risks.

152
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:51,709
Quantum amplitude estimate
promises reduced sampling

153
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:53,929
requirements in ideal conditions.

154
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:59,719
So while full speedups evade more
mature hardware, NSCA hybrid sampling

155
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:03,559
methods have cut simulation time
modestly by integrating short

156
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:07,219
death quantum circuits to estimate
probabilities more efficiently.

157
00:09:07,694 --> 00:09:12,884
A risk team ran a pilot feeding random
paths into quantum subin to assess

158
00:09:12,884 --> 00:09:18,344
extreme loss bilities, while not a full
speed up yet, it sharpened tail risk

159
00:09:18,344 --> 00:09:22,904
estimates in a fraction of classical
only pipeline time fraud detection.

160
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:26,984
Also benefits encoding transaction
at into quantum kernel.

161
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:30,704
Methods can highlight subtle
correlations, classical methods usually.

162
00:09:30,734 --> 00:09:33,564
Miss in A POC, which was done.

163
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:37,914
Analysts coded features of transaction
graphs onto quantum circuits and

164
00:09:37,914 --> 00:09:39,924
used outputs in a classifier.

165
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:44,294
Results card patterns that improve
detection precision slightly.

166
00:09:44,324 --> 00:09:46,124
Again, as I said, small wins matter.

167
00:09:46,694 --> 00:09:50,624
These remains absolutely proof of
concepts, but they teach teams how

168
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,094
to integrate quantum sub routines.

169
00:09:52,154 --> 00:09:56,024
Validate outputs and align experiments
with compliance and security needs

170
00:09:56,654 --> 00:10:01,784
organizations built this know-how now
that they're actually well prepared to

171
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:06,194
where the hardware can scale and how
to make sure we use hybrid approaches.

172
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:08,119
Now, let's take another example.

173
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:10,909
What do we do in a
pharmaceutical r and d case?

174
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:14,859
So drug discovery and molecular
simulation naturally aligned with

175
00:10:14,859 --> 00:10:17,989
quantum comedic because that, that's
where it's supposed to shine, right?

176
00:10:17,989 --> 00:10:21,199
Frankly speaking, chemistry based
quantum mechanics and classical

177
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:25,129
approximation struggle with electron
interactions in complex molecules.

178
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:29,899
Early experiments of small molecules like
hydrogen chains, small organic compounds,

179
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:35,389
demonstrate quantum circuits modeling
electronic structure more faithfully.

180
00:10:36,334 --> 00:10:41,704
In one collaboration, researchers ran
hardware experiments to estimate ground

181
00:10:41,704 --> 00:10:43,684
state energies of a small molecule.

182
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,084
Raw results were very noisy.

183
00:10:46,414 --> 00:10:50,314
Yet after mitigation and combining
with classical methods, they matched

184
00:10:50,314 --> 00:10:54,904
expectations closely enough to
filter out false lead, which is very

185
00:10:55,514 --> 00:10:59,924
important and a huge way, frankly
speaking, that saved weeks of lab

186
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:02,444
synthesis and testing in another exam.

187
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:04,724
In another example,
completely different example.

188
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,699
A virtual screening pipeline
used quantum sub proteins to

189
00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:10,439
define binding energy estimates.

190
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:16,665
For a short list of candidate ligands
targeting a known enzyme, classical

191
00:11:16,665 --> 00:11:21,074
talking, produced 50 candidates,
quantum enhanced evaluation, trimmed

192
00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:26,084
it down to 15 experiment essays,
then prioritize the top five, one

193
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:27,764
of which showed promising activity.

194
00:11:28,364 --> 00:11:30,939
As you can see, there is
the filtering is done.

195
00:11:31,344 --> 00:11:35,454
Very efficiently beyond small
molecules, teams explore protein

196
00:11:35,454 --> 00:11:37,974
folding or binding side computations.

197
00:11:38,424 --> 00:11:41,994
While classical AI tools like
alpha fold excel at predicting

198
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:46,374
structures, quantum methods may offer
complimentary insights into energy

199
00:11:46,374 --> 00:11:48,624
landscapes or dynamic confirmations.

200
00:11:49,124 --> 00:11:51,164
A startup ran hybrid loops.

201
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:56,204
Classical simulations suggested several
confirmations, quantum subro routines,

202
00:11:56,204 --> 00:11:58,454
estimated relative energies under.

203
00:11:58,689 --> 00:11:59,709
Different conditions.

204
00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:04,599
Results informed lab experiments
in lead optimization.

205
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:08,439
Quantum enhanced machine learning,
refines predictions of toxicity

206
00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:14,110
or solubility, encoding molecular
descriptors into quantum kernel models.

207
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:14,290
Some.

208
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:19,494
Some sometimes improved classification
accuracy on historical data sets,

209
00:12:19,854 --> 00:12:21,984
guiding selection of safer scaffolds.

210
00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:26,905
Pharma r and d also considers proper
optimization of clinical trial

211
00:12:26,905 --> 00:12:32,094
designs, defining patient cohorts
based on multiple biomark biomarkers.

212
00:12:32,525 --> 00:12:35,704
Quantum inspired algorithms
helps explore trial parameter

213
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:39,439
spaces to maximize statistical
power under budget constraints.

214
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,920
A biotech firm.

215
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:46,180
Ran a pilot to optimize trial arm
allocations given limited patient

216
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,770
populations and multiple endpoints.

217
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:52,585
Of course, the results while full
scale benefit evades larger machines,

218
00:12:53,035 --> 00:12:56,425
the excise built institutional
understanding of mapping such

219
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:58,855
problems to quantum fend formulations.

220
00:12:59,455 --> 00:13:03,925
These pilots show that investing in
quantum chemistry and optimizational

221
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:07,390
skills today speeds readiness
for larger simulations when

222
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,350
error corrected machines arrive.

223
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,150
Now let's actually see how to
do logistics and supply chain.

224
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,689
Again, we are trying to establish how
quantum computing can actually help

225
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:21,459
in various industries because of which
it's better to go over each and how each

226
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:24,699
of the POCs were done in each of the
industries and how understand better on

227
00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:29,920
how quantum computing can help logistical
problems like vehicle routing, inventory

228
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,840
allocation, and scheduling often become
combinatorial mountains in pilot studies.

229
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,439
Quantum.

230
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:41,334
Inspired solvers explore routing
variance beyond classical heuristics,

231
00:13:41,574 --> 00:13:45,895
uncovering alternate routes that reduce
total distance or delivery time by a

232
00:13:45,895 --> 00:13:48,115
noticeable margin on scoped instances.

233
00:13:48,805 --> 00:13:52,565
For example a delivery company
modeled a region with 15 vehicles

234
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,665
and hundred stops during peak season.

235
00:13:55,175 --> 00:13:58,415
Classical SOLs found
good solutions quickly.

236
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:03,180
But a hybrid quantum test suggested
a slight rerouting for one vehicle

237
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,440
that literally avoided a traffic
bottleneck predicted by recent data

238
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,270
shaving of 5% of the total time, over
hundreds of deliveries that quickly

239
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:16,230
add up over lower labor costs, happier
customers, essentially speaking

240
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,420
inventory management benefits to.

241
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,275
So now.

242
00:14:19,665 --> 00:14:23,565
Optimizing stock across warehouses
under capacity and demand.

243
00:14:24,105 --> 00:14:26,835
Uncertainties can use
quantum enhanced heuristics.

244
00:14:27,285 --> 00:14:32,145
A retailer pilot piloted a hybrid
workflow where classical forecast

245
00:14:32,145 --> 00:14:35,985
predicted demand distributions,
quantum sub proteins, then optimized

246
00:14:35,985 --> 00:14:38,835
inventory allocations the result.

247
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:44,900
Reduce overstock by 10% and out
of stock incidents by 8% compared

248
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,310
to classical only benchmarks.

249
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:51,200
So scheduling maintenance crews across
sites with various skills and time

250
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,150
is another combinatorial challenge.

251
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:58,430
A utility company tested quantum
inspired servers to assign crews

252
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,020
under multiple constraints.

253
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,730
Early results showed 15% better
utilization in simulated scenarios,

254
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,980
prompting deeper investigation.

255
00:15:07,905 --> 00:15:12,015
Even demand forecasting sees
quantum exploration while classical

256
00:15:12,075 --> 00:15:13,605
machine learning dominates.

257
00:15:13,905 --> 00:15:17,805
Some teams test quantum machine
learning prototypes to capture

258
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:19,485
complex feature correlations.

259
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:25,155
In one pilot, a supply chain group,
encoded time series and categorical

260
00:15:25,155 --> 00:15:30,480
features into quantum feature maps
and used, various clash variational

261
00:15:30,485 --> 00:15:32,355
classifiers to predict demand spikes.

262
00:15:32,985 --> 00:15:35,685
Accuracy improvements were
modest, but consistent across

263
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,315
several data scope data sets.

264
00:15:37,945 --> 00:15:42,175
The key is basically isolating manageable
sub-problems, focus initially on critic

265
00:15:42,385 --> 00:15:45,745
critical product line or regional hub
rather than the entire global network.

266
00:15:45,835 --> 00:15:49,255
It's ba It's important for us
to slice the problem down into

267
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:51,415
multiple smaller sub slices.

268
00:15:51,915 --> 00:15:54,345
Now let's actually move
on to how do we assess.

269
00:15:54,345 --> 00:15:56,320
Quantum hardware and simulators.

270
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,780
Just a quick second.

271
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,410
Yeah.

272
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,670
So multiple platforms make quantum
export experiments accessible cloud

273
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:07,260
services provide entry points to super
contracting tab trap Dion, and enabling

274
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:12,720
devices AWS bracket Azure Quantum, IBM
Quantum, Google Quantum ai all offer

275
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,820
simulators with noise models and real
hardware queues when starting prototype

276
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,530
on similars to refined circuits.

277
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,160
Check correctness and
anticipate nice impact.

278
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,680
I recall juggling different SDK versions
one day testing on and then on circ,

279
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,980
then on an ion trap system via AWS.

280
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,880
Each had its own quirks, frankly
speaking, documenting dependencies,

281
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,350
gate sets, connectivity maps, and nice
parameters became part of these workflows.

282
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,085
So that upfront effort pays off.

283
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,000
You already know how to adapt your
certificate certificates to newer

284
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,190
devices, queue times and cost vary.

285
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,580
Of course, running many shots
on real hardware can incur daily

286
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,400
end expenses to manage that plan.

287
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,630
Experiments carefully simulate first and
then only run final circuits on hardware.

288
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,670
Use nice simulators to predict
outcomes and catch major issues early.

289
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:05,619
Keep experiments small.

290
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:11,079
If a problem, max to 60 qubits, but only
device only offers 30 with good fidelity.

291
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:16,300
Identify a reduced instance or partition
the problem into multiple sub problems.

292
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,720
Maintain scripts to log, run metadata.

293
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:23,755
Like date device, calibration metrics,
circuit version, so on and so forth.

294
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:27,895
So you can actually compare results
over time as hardware evolves.

295
00:17:28,405 --> 00:17:33,055
Engaging early with platform communities
like forums, user groups, helps also

296
00:17:33,055 --> 00:17:37,045
learn better practices and avoid pitfalls
because I have, I myself, have been

297
00:17:37,045 --> 00:17:41,695
engaging in user groups for quite some
time and I learned quite a lot than just

298
00:17:41,695 --> 00:17:44,215
using regular documentation over time.

299
00:17:44,215 --> 00:17:47,395
This actually helps build
reliable experimentation pipeline.

300
00:17:48,195 --> 00:17:51,465
So now actually, how do we do
software and algorithmic development?

301
00:17:52,335 --> 00:17:55,455
Developing qu quantum applications
involves more than writing circuits.

302
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:00,610
First translate a business problem
into quantum friendly formulation for

303
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:04,120
optimization, defined cost functions,
and constraints that fit variational

304
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,980
algorithms or icing model mappings.

305
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:11,830
In a finance pilot, a team had to express
expected return risk, co variance as

306
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,240
cost Hamiltonian translating domain
concepts into qubit interactions.

307
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,730
Next, optimize circuits for hardware.

308
00:18:19,135 --> 00:18:22,895
Choose qubit mapping, mappings
respecting connectivity.

309
00:18:22,955 --> 00:18:26,555
Decompose gates into native
operations and limit depth to

310
00:18:26,555 --> 00:18:27,965
stay within coherence times.

311
00:18:28,535 --> 00:18:31,085
It's like customizing a recipe for
available kitchen tools, right?

312
00:18:31,085 --> 00:18:34,265
You might want to swap an ingredient
here and there, and it just a cooking

313
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:37,865
time based on the stove during the
execution, apply error mitigation,

314
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:42,125
run circuits at varied or nice levels,
correct measurement, statistics, and

315
00:18:42,635 --> 00:18:44,345
extrapolate towards ideal results.

316
00:18:45,085 --> 00:18:45,955
I remember the ra.

317
00:18:45,955 --> 00:18:50,395
I remember running the same circuit with
doubled gait durations to amplify noise.

318
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,065
Then using extrapolation to
estimate the zero noise output.

319
00:18:53,455 --> 00:18:55,435
Though imperfect it gave a clearer signal.

320
00:18:56,185 --> 00:18:57,700
Post-processing integrates.

321
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,560
Quantum outputs into
classical decision pipelines.

322
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,530
Feeding refined solution
into larger workflows.

323
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:05,420
It is key.

324
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,060
Basically simulate with
realistic, nice models.

325
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,590
As circuits run hardware tests, analyze
deviations, tweak again, over time.

326
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,550
Teams develop intuition.

327
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,030
You get to know this over time
and version controls matter.

328
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,820
Keep circuits and repository tag versions.

329
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,195
Track trans translation settings.

330
00:19:22,845 --> 00:19:25,115
Avoid simulator tests
to catch regressions.

331
00:19:25,435 --> 00:19:26,395
Automate, sorry, automate.

332
00:19:26,545 --> 00:19:30,715
Simulator test or casual regressions
log results systematically

333
00:19:30,985 --> 00:19:33,475
so that you actually get to
know what is really going on.

334
00:19:33,475 --> 00:19:35,875
You can compare tests over
time, and so on and so forth.

335
00:19:36,415 --> 00:19:40,885
Next, what goes on with the
organizational strategy, a structured

336
00:19:40,885 --> 00:19:42,535
approach, maximizes impact.

337
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:47,005
First, identify use cases with
clear metrics and manageable scope.

338
00:19:47,005 --> 00:19:51,550
Host workshops where domain experts
outline pain points, then assess

339
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,560
which might suit quantum pilots.

340
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,760
For example, a retail team might point
to seasonal inventory imbalances.

341
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,460
A logistic group flags,
dynamic routing challenges.

342
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:05,170
Second, build capability
train staff through online

343
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,550
courses internal hackathons.

344
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,010
Our partnerships with research labs, so
on and so forth, form small Quantums Conor

345
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,195
teams empower to prototype ideas quickly.

346
00:20:14,565 --> 00:20:18,045
Third, execute proof of concept
experiments run on simulators.

347
00:20:18,045 --> 00:20:22,575
Then hardware define success criteria such
as solution quality improvement over time.

348
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,025
S saving simulative to
classical baselines.

349
00:20:26,595 --> 00:20:28,455
In one organization, they set a threshold.

350
00:20:28,485 --> 00:20:32,805
If a quantum pilot could match classical
results within 5% of error, they

351
00:20:32,805 --> 00:20:34,395
considered worthwhile stepping stone.

352
00:20:34,895 --> 00:20:37,445
Even matching performance
builds familiarity.

353
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:41,045
You get to understand the quantum
landscape, so allocate budget

354
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:42,515
for cloud compute over time.

355
00:20:42,785 --> 00:20:46,025
Maintain a roadmap that revisits
use cases as hardware matures.

356
00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:49,535
Avoid ad hoc experiments with
no clear business alignment.

357
00:20:49,925 --> 00:20:52,680
You would definitely want to
focus on measurable outcomes

358
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,720
and learning objectives.

359
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,080
I have seen companies spend months.

360
00:20:57,015 --> 00:21:00,075
Running random circuits without
tying them to specific problems.

361
00:21:00,585 --> 00:21:03,915
They end up with reports full of technical
jargon, but little business insight.

362
00:21:04,215 --> 00:21:08,715
In contrast, teams aligning pilots to
concrete use cases actually do better.

363
00:21:09,215 --> 00:21:10,805
So what is a near time?

364
00:21:10,905 --> 00:21:12,855
What is a future of the
quantum business value?

365
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:17,280
I. Even in NSC teams report modest
but meaningful improvements, faster

366
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,690
optimization on scale, on small to
medium instances, I might save a

367
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,730
few percentage of delivery times.

368
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,460
A chemistry experiment might roll
out of all state early finance.

369
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,140
Test my Titan Risk Securities.

370
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,450
What starts as a pilot on
a reduced small scale model

371
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,710
becomes a full scale application.

372
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:39,630
Later the experience gained understanding
noise mitigation, hybrid design platform,

373
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,470
a platform quirks become priceless
when fault tire and machines arrive.

374
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,305
So by balancing realistic expectations
with curiosity and experimentation.

375
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,970
You actually understand how to harness
quantum breakthrough breakthroughs as soon

376
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,040
as they become practical in my, sorry.

377
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,460
In my experience, teams that
document every pilot success or

378
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,210
failure built a knowledge base that
later accelerated their work when

379
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,940
improving devices re sufficient scale.

380
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,080
What once was a dozen qubit experiment
becomes a stepping stone to hundreds

381
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,370
of qubits with manual faction.

382
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,500
What are the key takeaways right?

383
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:18,435
Quantum computing in today's SQA is not
a magic bullet, but if it, it offers

384
00:22:18,435 --> 00:22:22,785
genuine opportunities when we choose
suitable problems, adopt hybrid methods

385
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:27,525
and building internal capability pace
dividends as hardware improves, I

386
00:22:27,525 --> 00:22:31,695
encourage you to identify one well scope
use case in your domain, perhaps a small

387
00:22:31,695 --> 00:22:35,565
optimization or a simulation that fill
tens of qubits and shallow circuits.

388
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,485
Run a pilot on simulators.

389
00:22:37,485 --> 00:22:39,285
First, refine your formulation.

390
00:22:39,315 --> 00:22:43,275
Test circuit designs, then move
to hardware runs, collecting data.

391
00:22:43,545 --> 00:22:44,985
Document literally every step.

392
00:22:45,135 --> 00:22:47,085
Share all your lessons across teams.

393
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,815
Engage with a wider com quantum community.

394
00:22:50,025 --> 00:22:53,745
Over time, you'll build a repository of
patterns, common ways to map problems,

395
00:22:53,745 --> 00:22:56,355
to variation circuits these patterns.

396
00:22:56,585 --> 00:22:59,285
Reduce friction for future projects.

397
00:22:59,285 --> 00:23:01,625
Allocate a mod and how?

398
00:23:01,775 --> 00:23:05,375
Encourage a culture of exploration
balanced with pragmatism.

399
00:23:05,795 --> 00:23:09,335
Celebrate small wins, which will
definitely help you set the groundwork.

400
00:23:10,025 --> 00:23:13,265
Embrace this explore area
era of exploration with both

401
00:23:13,385 --> 00:23:14,855
enthusiasm and pragmatism.

402
00:23:15,335 --> 00:23:16,115
Thank you for listening.

403
00:23:16,115 --> 00:23:18,215
I look forward to your
questions and your continued.

404
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,230
Conversations about how
quantum can actually create

405
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,790
value in your organizations.

406
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,990
Thank you again for joining Con 42.

407
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,070
Hope you all have a good time.

408
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:26,690
I.
