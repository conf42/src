00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,919
Hi everyone, this is Omar.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,199
I'm a solution architect.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,620
Welcome to the conference, and
today's topic is Powering AI

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,629
Enhanced Cloud Native Integrations.

5
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:18,490
This talks about the performance
statistics of AI enhanced cloud native

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:23,320
integration platforms, and also we
learn about the practical implementation

7
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:26,230
strategies that improve efficiency.

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:31,330
Security and reliability
across your enterprise systems.

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,230
I'll go to this PDF and we'll talk about
each slide in the next few minutes.

10
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,870
First topic would like to cover
is performance advantages,

11
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,445
model memory efficiency.

12
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:48,155
Fast compilation and static typing.

13
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:55,715
In con model, the goal lightweight,
enables the highly efficient parallel

14
00:00:55,715 --> 00:00:58,115
processing with the minimal overhead.

15
00:00:58,615 --> 00:01:04,405
This model effortlessly handles
thousands of simultaneous connections

16
00:01:04,975 --> 00:01:08,785
while maintaining the consistency
of in the performance side.

17
00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:11,445
Then we'll go with the memory efficiency.

18
00:01:11,945 --> 00:01:15,965
This mainly focus on the
garbage collection algorithms

19
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:20,315
where it dramatically minimize,
the memory footprint without

20
00:01:20,315 --> 00:01:22,975
disrupting the operations system.

21
00:01:23,035 --> 00:01:29,125
Resources remain optimally allocated
even on extreme processing loads

22
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:31,305
in case of fast compilation.

23
00:01:31,805 --> 00:01:36,425
It is almost like near in instant
build cycle, significantly

24
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:39,095
accelerate the development process.

25
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:45,395
Engineering teams can rapidly iterate
through complex integration challenges

26
00:01:45,485 --> 00:01:47,076
with the minimal weight timings.

27
00:01:47,576 --> 00:01:54,765
Static typing enables compact time error,
checking sustainably reduce unexpected

28
00:01:54,771 --> 00:01:57,346
runtime values in production systems.

29
00:01:57,766 --> 00:02:01,276
Mission critical enterprise
system maintains exceptionally

30
00:02:01,336 --> 00:02:03,496
uptime and reliability

31
00:02:03,996 --> 00:02:09,806
by having this, what is the real time
impact for your enterprise applications?

32
00:02:10,676 --> 00:02:16,351
It reduces the 25% of the development
deployment period where the

33
00:02:16,356 --> 00:02:18,556
microservices architecture slashed.

34
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:24,276
It deployment cycles by a quarter
percentage compared to, its own legacy

35
00:02:24,276 --> 00:02:31,921
systems just by, and also it helps to
bring faster market of their application

36
00:02:32,421 --> 00:02:34,466
in case of reliability improvements.

37
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:39,106
Our this goal and based approach helps.

38
00:02:39,856 --> 00:02:44,566
30% fewer critical instance
with a significantly reduced

39
00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:46,426
mean time to recovery.

40
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:53,256
It also supports in multi-cloud
and also reduces 23% of its time

41
00:02:54,246 --> 00:02:59,166
for any concurrency model, which
is optimized to reduce resource

42
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:05,491
utilization across different
providers and infrastructure costs.

43
00:03:05,991 --> 00:03:13,491
Okay, now let's go to how this, a enhanced
integration helps in different pages of

44
00:03:13,491 --> 00:03:16,061
your deployment or development periods

45
00:03:16,561 --> 00:03:17,681
even support as well.

46
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:22,291
First topic we call about, like
what is automated data mapping.

47
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:29,031
A go forward AI framework have slashed
manual integration efforts by 25%.

48
00:03:29,421 --> 00:03:33,951
These intelligent systems analyze
complex data structures in real

49
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:38,091
time and generates optimal mapping
without human intervention.

50
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:41,576
How in the background it helps is like it.

51
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:45,381
I identify all the existing
are across the world.

52
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:49,780
Similar kind of patterns
for each data node level.

53
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:57,606
And brings down your entire efforts by 25%
by providing the existing, by leveraging

54
00:03:57,606 --> 00:04:02,555
the existing, mapping structures across
the landscape or your application.

55
00:04:02,555 --> 00:04:05,345
It's going to read the backend.

56
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:06,035
Okay?

57
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:10,011
Each node level identify, okay, this
is close to this one, like that.

58
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:16,005
So this gives you, reduce the time
by 25%, which is a very significant

59
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,046
change when it comes to mapping level.

60
00:04:18,546 --> 00:04:21,505
Okay, let's go to the
intelligent error handling.

61
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:27,765
Advanced day models now anticipates
integration failures before they occur.

62
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:33,070
These proactive systems
automatically implement self-healing

63
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,470
protocols and dynamic adapter.

64
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,460
To changing operational conditions.

65
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,320
Next topic, accuracy improvements.

66
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:48,220
AI driven transformation engines have
delivered a remarkable 30% improvement

67
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,345
in data accuracy, where it has
very various sophisticated patterns

68
00:04:53,475 --> 00:04:58,830
which recogni and also recognize
algorithms identify and prevent.

69
00:04:59,325 --> 00:05:04,755
Potential quality issues
before they impact operations.

70
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,165
Let's go to the next slide.

71
00:05:06,665 --> 00:05:12,625
What are the performance or this
platform benchmark comparison between

72
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:19,066
different, integration applications,
like C-P-I-S-A-P, MuleSoft?

73
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:22,445
Apache Camel and Go based solutions here.

74
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:26,226
Mainly if you see the dark color,
which is the performance score

75
00:05:26,346 --> 00:05:31,356
and light color is the resources
efficiency in all these aspects.

76
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:36,835
Mainly we notice go based solutions
always, dominates our, gives

77
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:39,025
better results in both the metrics.

78
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:41,835
It always like significantly form.

79
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,356
There you have the traditional
integration platforms.

80
00:05:44,856 --> 00:05:50,376
Our enterprise benchmarking also
revealed that our goal-based solutions

81
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:57,006
deliver up to 32% higher performance
scores and 34% better resource

82
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:59,886
efficiency compared to legacy systems.

83
00:06:00,336 --> 00:06:05,636
These impressive guidance translates
directly into reduced infrastructure

84
00:06:05,636 --> 00:06:08,516
cost and improves scalability.

85
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:13,696
Also enhance responsiveness by our
mission critical integration force.

86
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:16,881
Now, another key topic which
I would like to cover today

87
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:19,791
is security only four phases.

88
00:06:20,011 --> 00:06:25,361
One is identifying threat detection,
analyzing the threats, responding

89
00:06:25,361 --> 00:06:27,481
to your threats and the learnings.

90
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:28,371
Okay.

91
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:29,841
Threat detection.

92
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:30,621
Okay.

93
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:33,651
In any security.

94
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:36,591
First, you need to have your
threats to be identified.

95
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:43,090
Our robust security libraries implemented
sophisticated patterns to recognize

96
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,871
the, threats using algorithms.

97
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:49,301
Ous access pattern are
identified and flagged in real

98
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:50,772
time microsecond precision.

99
00:06:51,272 --> 00:06:54,032
Once you identify the
threats, then we analyze.

100
00:06:54,062 --> 00:06:57,122
Okay, we have advanced
mission learning models.

101
00:06:57,212 --> 00:07:00,991
Evaluate that vectors using
contextual intelligence.

102
00:07:01,412 --> 00:07:07,972
This sophisticated approach has
reduced a false po alerts by 23%.

103
00:07:08,392 --> 00:07:12,522
Minimize the security response recession.

104
00:07:12,582 --> 00:07:17,342
Engineered counter measurements,
deploy with subsecond latency.

105
00:07:17,672 --> 00:07:22,952
Compromise Systems automatically
implement isolation protocol to

106
00:07:22,952 --> 00:07:25,202
prevent lateral network traverse.

107
00:07:25,702 --> 00:07:26,867
What other learnings?

108
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:33,617
Every security incident enhances
future edition capabilities by 27%.

109
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:39,737
Through reinforcement learning algorithms,
the system continuously evolves its threat

110
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:42,692
intelligence database that will help.

111
00:07:43,082 --> 00:07:44,972
Next identifier, next threat.

112
00:07:45,472 --> 00:07:46,612
Detection pattern.

113
00:07:47,112 --> 00:07:49,332
Now we go to the edge.

114
00:07:49,332 --> 00:07:50,382
Computer integration.

115
00:07:50,882 --> 00:07:53,942
In this integration world, you
have to have your data to be

116
00:07:53,942 --> 00:07:58,877
collected from various I sensors
in a real time, field data.

117
00:07:59,297 --> 00:08:02,732
Once you have the data
collection in the local itself.

118
00:08:03,227 --> 00:08:08,317
You identify, local, runtime
excludes the optimized data genetics.

119
00:08:08,677 --> 00:08:15,747
Once it has it enriches based on embedded,
machine learning models and understands

120
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:20,117
its contextual understanding, then
we'll go to the cloud synchronization

121
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:22,007
after having a and enrichment.

122
00:08:22,577 --> 00:08:27,287
The filter data transmits security to them
securely into the cloud infrastructure

123
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:32,597
where the insightful distribution
will come, which has actionable

124
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:36,037
intelligence device generates decisions.

125
00:08:36,187 --> 00:08:40,357
Whether how it takes, this
is all microservices based,

126
00:08:40,857 --> 00:08:46,897
communications analysis, processing,
enrichment, syncing with cloud.

127
00:08:46,987 --> 00:08:47,497
Then.

128
00:08:48,352 --> 00:08:52,512
It goes to the distribution,
our lightweight runtime and

129
00:08:52,512 --> 00:08:54,252
concurrent processing capabilities.

130
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:59,682
Revolutionize edge computing integration
with sophisticated AI capabilities.

131
00:09:00,182 --> 00:09:05,012
Implement this implementation has
demonstrated reduced data processing

132
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:09,602
latency by 18% while decreasing
cloud bandwidth consumption

133
00:09:09,692 --> 00:09:12,242
and storage overhead by 15%.

134
00:09:12,872 --> 00:09:13,322
Delivering.

135
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:19,517
Substantial operational cost savings
and performance improvements,

136
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,642
DevOps, tooling improvements
you have mainly.

137
00:09:23,557 --> 00:09:29,527
Automated pipelines we have mainly
with the go in the go, we have power

138
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:34,837
with CICD pipelines, which reduces the
deployment time by 40%, while validating

139
00:09:34,897 --> 00:09:40,677
the integration points with the 99.8%
accuracy, which is, close to a hundred

140
00:09:40,677 --> 00:09:45,297
percent, which has a seamless deployment
occur without human intervention

141
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,967
eliminating, most of the manual errors.

142
00:09:48,897 --> 00:09:52,947
Intelligent testing, machine
learning algorithms identify and

143
00:09:53,007 --> 00:09:58,087
prioritize critical test scenarios
with, 87% greater efficiency.

144
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:05,647
Also, these testings s strategically focus
on high risk integration points, which

145
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:08,437
reduces the overall testing time by 35%.

146
00:10:08,937 --> 00:10:11,757
Once the testing is there in the
production system, you have to have

147
00:10:11,757 --> 00:10:13,557
a product protective monitoring.

148
00:10:14,262 --> 00:10:19,902
This advanced anomaly detection
identifies potential issues 15

149
00:10:19,902 --> 00:10:22,572
minutes before, before their impact.

150
00:10:22,932 --> 00:10:28,842
Our system initiates automated
resolution protocols for 73% of instance

151
00:10:29,082 --> 00:10:31,472
before operational disturbance per,

152
00:10:31,972 --> 00:10:36,772
we have mainly four different type of,
implementation patterns, based on APIs.

153
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:41,947
API Gateway pattern where Go Functions
has a high performance and resource.

154
00:10:41,947 --> 00:10:42,937
Efficien API.

155
00:10:42,937 --> 00:10:48,667
Gateways that intelligently routes
request orchestrate services and

156
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:53,257
implement robust authentication
with minimal computational overhead.

157
00:10:54,217 --> 00:10:55,687
Here, this is the main thing.

158
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:58,382
The next one is event driven architecture.

159
00:10:59,197 --> 00:11:02,857
Go competency model with the
channels, create sophisticated.

160
00:11:03,502 --> 00:11:07,252
Event processing pipelines
enabling seamless communication

161
00:11:07,522 --> 00:11:13,632
where distributed system response
dynamically, that changes the state

162
00:11:14,232 --> 00:11:16,812
across your integration platforms.

163
00:11:17,312 --> 00:11:22,202
And the sidecar pattern is something like,
it's like very close to legacy related

164
00:11:22,202 --> 00:11:27,302
things where, you keep, word services
separate alongside your, Companion

165
00:11:27,302 --> 00:11:33,122
processes and also introduced advanced
a capabilities enhanced functionalities

166
00:11:33,182 --> 00:11:38,252
without requiring modifications to
your legacy data code database where

167
00:11:38,252 --> 00:11:43,272
it keeps, we keep running that one
and parallelly, you go and develop, go

168
00:11:43,272 --> 00:11:46,232
services, waste integration approach.

169
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:50,232
Next one is triangular
feet pattern, in this.

170
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:50,982
Go.

171
00:11:50,982 --> 00:11:53,922
Implementation incrementally
replaces your legacy.

172
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:59,242
So integration components through s
interception points, facilitating non

173
00:11:59,242 --> 00:12:05,122
deceptive migration while maintaining
the system in stability and integrity

174
00:12:05,362 --> 00:12:07,102
throughout the transformation process.

175
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:12,442
Now it has, every pattern has its
own advantages, based on the, our

176
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:17,502
enterprise application integrations,
current, Approach and the best of the

177
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:23,552
best goal and, architecture will find
out which one is going to useful the

178
00:12:23,552 --> 00:12:25,362
imple, while implementing this one.

179
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:25,812
Okay.

180
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:32,592
What are the success metrics, which saw
22% higher success rate in enterprise

181
00:12:32,592 --> 00:12:39,452
integration initiatives that be completed
mostly on time and within the budget?

182
00:12:39,952 --> 00:12:41,662
30% deployment efficiency.

183
00:12:42,622 --> 00:12:48,697
It accelerates continuous delivery
pipelines with, fewer roadblocks, 25%

184
00:12:48,697 --> 00:12:53,902
less manual work intelligence automation
eliminate repetitive integration topics,

185
00:12:54,152 --> 00:12:56,932
that reduces your, manual hour by 25%.

186
00:12:57,802 --> 00:13:03,872
At the same time, 30% improved accuracy,
what we observed, okay, what happens?

187
00:13:04,372 --> 00:13:10,552
When you are doing this less manual
work and automation that improves the,

188
00:13:10,932 --> 00:13:18,242
accuracy to reduce any errors by doing the
APIs across your system boundaries, 18%

189
00:13:18,392 --> 00:13:23,802
reduce latency when it reduces, when it,
all these measurements you have improved

190
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:29,292
accuracy, deployment, efficiency, and
all response automatically it reduces.

191
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:35,432
Communication latency by 18% for all
your, mission critical transactions.

192
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:39,802
Processing our nation's implementing
goal line based integration platform

193
00:13:39,922 --> 00:13:46,332
consistently achieve a measurable
improvements across all key different

194
00:13:46,332 --> 00:13:52,242
indicators resulting in substantial
return on investment and competitive

195
00:13:52,242 --> 00:13:55,137
advantage in their digital transformation.

196
00:13:55,797 --> 00:13:56,757
Initiatives,

197
00:13:57,257 --> 00:14:01,437
how we implement, just to give
you the roadmap first, we assess

198
00:14:02,187 --> 00:14:06,877
that, where we conduct a thorough
analysis of our existing, system

199
00:14:06,997 --> 00:14:09,397
and performance bottlenecks.

200
00:14:09,697 --> 00:14:15,697
Then we map specific business processes
that would benefit go competency model.

201
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:21,202
We may not go to every point needs to be
replaced, but we can definitely suggest

202
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,292
what are the benefits by doing this.

203
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:29,582
Then we can implement pilot project where
we develop a targeted, go microservice

204
00:14:29,582 --> 00:14:32,132
with the clearly defined boundaries.

205
00:14:32,252 --> 00:14:35,462
Select a high visibility
integration pattern challenge,

206
00:14:35,852 --> 00:14:40,022
and to demonstrate measurable
improvements, framework deployment,

207
00:14:40,202 --> 00:14:43,712
development, and deployments in this.

208
00:14:44,702 --> 00:14:48,542
Established standard, go design
patterns and reduced components.

209
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:52,402
We engineer robust connectors
for mission critical enterprise

210
00:14:52,402 --> 00:14:54,082
systems and data sources.

211
00:14:54,582 --> 00:14:58,197
Then we can scale up the
deployment strategically, expand go

212
00:14:58,337 --> 00:15:04,392
implementations across our integration
landscape, implement comprehensive

213
00:15:04,392 --> 00:15:09,462
metrics to quantify performance
gains and written on management.

214
00:15:09,962 --> 00:15:14,852
These four steps, gives confidence to
customers and which is a very targeted,

215
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:20,982
approach where we can eliminate a lot
of, overhead on the customer by using,

216
00:15:21,762 --> 00:15:27,162
the set security measures and approach
of the development, all the things.

217
00:15:27,662 --> 00:15:29,322
Thank you, for your time.

218
00:15:29,922 --> 00:15:31,272
I'm open to all the questions.

219
00:15:31,772 --> 00:15:32,492
Have a nice day.
