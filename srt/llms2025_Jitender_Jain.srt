3
00:00:06,685 --> 00:00:08,905
in financial services and enterprises.

4
00:00:09,405 --> 00:00:15,105
I'm excited to be speaking at Con
42 on large language Models in 2025.

5
00:00:15,794 --> 00:00:21,225
I'm jja a software engineer with
extensive experience in ai, cloud

6
00:00:21,225 --> 00:00:23,175
computing and financial technology.

7
00:00:24,015 --> 00:00:24,825
In this session, I.

8
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:27,784
Particularly in financial services.

9
00:00:28,284 --> 00:00:31,284
Before we dive in, let me
briefly introduce myself.

10
00:00:31,704 --> 00:00:35,724
I have over 17 years of experience
working in financial technology,

11
00:00:36,444 --> 00:00:39,984
specializing in ai, cloud
computing, and software engineering.

12
00:00:40,705 --> 00:00:44,724
Throughout my career, I have worked
in on AI driven transformations

13
00:00:44,724 --> 00:00:49,974
for financial institutions, and I
also hold patents in this space.

14
00:00:50,474 --> 00:00:51,374
A quick disclaimer.

15
00:00:51,874 --> 00:00:55,294
The opinion shared in this
presentation are my own and do

16
00:00:55,294 --> 00:00:57,095
not represent my employer's views.

17
00:00:57,595 --> 00:01:02,695
This talk is intended to share
industry insights, trends, and best

18
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:04,975
practices based on my experience

19
00:01:05,475 --> 00:01:10,375
agenda for the talk, how AI
enables business predictions.

20
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:17,255
Real world industry use cases, application
of AI and financial services, a case

21
00:01:17,255 --> 00:01:24,025
study on AI driven income verification
for loan applications, key strategies for

22
00:01:24,025 --> 00:01:29,645
successful AI implementation, challenges
and considerations in adopting ai.

23
00:01:30,145 --> 00:01:32,845
And finally a look into the future of ai.

24
00:01:33,345 --> 00:01:35,235
Let's start with the fundamental question.

25
00:01:35,865 --> 00:01:37,725
What makes someone intelligent?

26
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:44,935
We recognize patterns, learn from
mistakes and develop gut feelings based

27
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:47,185
on the experiences and the knowledge.

28
00:01:47,685 --> 00:01:50,415
Similarly, AI systems are designed to.

29
00:01:50,915 --> 00:01:57,515
Learn from data experiences, refine their
understanding and improve over time.

30
00:01:58,015 --> 00:02:02,384
This learning ability makes
AI an invaluable tool for

31
00:02:02,384 --> 00:02:03,470
the business and this world.

32
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:08,390
The AI landscape is remarkably
diverse as you can see.

33
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:15,850
It encompasses multiple layers of
technologies from broad artificial

34
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:20,950
intelligence concepts at the top
to machine learning approaches in

35
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:27,120
the middle neural networks below
that, and specialized areas like T

36
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,970
Learning and gen AI at the foundation.

37
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,200
Each layer builds upon the previous one.

38
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:40,470
Creating an ecosystem of technologies
that solve different types of problems.

39
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,540
The possibilities with today's
AI tools are virtually endless.

40
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,490
From GitHub co-pilot assisting
developers to chat GPT conversational

41
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,680
abilities, clause nuanced responses.

42
00:02:55,655 --> 00:02:58,025
Deep seek specialized functions.

43
00:02:58,525 --> 00:03:04,265
Google's Gini for creativity and
growth approach to problem solving.

44
00:03:04,765 --> 00:03:09,355
Each represent different capabilities
that organizations can leverage

45
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,035
for specific business needs.

46
00:03:11,535 --> 00:03:12,375
Business predictions.

47
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:16,720
AI is not just about technology,
it's about vision and.

48
00:03:17,435 --> 00:03:18,334
Strategy.

49
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:23,834
Companies that successfully
implement AI will gain a significant

50
00:03:23,864 --> 00:03:28,294
competitive advantage according
to industry response reports.

51
00:03:29,164 --> 00:03:35,019
AI has the potential to double workforce
productivity with help of AI agents.

52
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,979
Surprisingly, surprisingly, only 20%
of AI models actually get deployed

53
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,659
in production, and that's sad.

54
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:43,759
Why?

55
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:47,929
Because of various technical,
operational, and strategic barriers.

56
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:53,409
Understanding these roadblocks is
crucial for AI and our success.

57
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:55,859
Here's the breakdown of the main reasons.

58
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,289
AI models do not make it to production.

59
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:01,909
More than 30% is because
of decision makers.

60
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:06,820
Resist changes to
existing operations, 35%.

61
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:12,360
Face technical integration Challenges
in the existing system, 25%.

62
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,300
Do not see strong enough
Model performance.

63
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,900
This highlights that leadership
buy-in and seamless integration are

64
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,110
as important as the AI model itself.

65
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,230
Industry use cases, AI driven
object detection is transforming

66
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:33,300
multiple industries in auto IT
auto in autonomous vehicles.

67
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,460
AI enables real time decision
making with help of YOLO models.

68
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,900
You look only once.

69
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,345
A retail object detect
transforms inventory management.

70
00:04:44,845 --> 00:04:51,245
AI systems can automatically identify
products on shelf, detect stockouts,

71
00:04:51,745 --> 00:04:58,135
verify planogram compliance, and
monitor real time inventory levels.

72
00:04:58,635 --> 00:05:00,585
This reduces labor costs.

73
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:06,375
While improving accuracy and
enabling faster restocking decisions

74
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:11,435
in financial services, document processing
represent a massive opportunity.

75
00:05:11,935 --> 00:05:16,645
Applying AI in financial services
document processing is one of the top

76
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:18,895
AI application in financial services.

77
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:24,585
It encompasses loan applications with
complex forms and supporting materials,

78
00:05:25,085 --> 00:05:31,385
invoice and receipt management for
both customers and internal operations.

79
00:05:31,885 --> 00:05:38,455
KYC compliance, document verification
and detailed analysis across multiple

80
00:05:38,455 --> 00:05:40,945
formats and legal frameworks.

81
00:05:41,445 --> 00:05:45,435
Another critical financial application
is fraud detection and prevention.

82
00:05:45,935 --> 00:05:52,385
AI systems Excel at NMU Detection,
identifying unusual patterns

83
00:05:53,105 --> 00:05:54,560
that might indicate fraud.

84
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:00,280
Real time transitions monitoring allows
for immediate verification of suspicious

85
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,790
activities, dramatically improving
security while reducing false positives.

86
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,610
AI is also enhancing customer
service through AI powered bots

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,470
and virtual assistants that
can handle routine inquiries.

88
00:06:15,965 --> 00:06:17,075
And transactions.

89
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:22,405
Automated fraud alerts provide timely
notification to customers about

90
00:06:22,405 --> 00:06:29,064
potential security issues, improving
both protection and customer experience.

91
00:06:29,564 --> 00:06:34,874
Financial institutions are increasingly
leveraging AI for personalization.

92
00:06:35,374 --> 00:06:37,924
This includes dynamic pricing.

93
00:06:38,424 --> 00:06:44,064
As well as customized long terms
based on individual risk profiles.

94
00:06:44,564 --> 00:06:49,874
Apart from that AI powered financial
planning tools that can provide

95
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:55,724
tailored advice based on customer
data and financial behaviors,

96
00:06:56,224 --> 00:06:58,619
investment management is another area.

97
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:04,749
Being transformed by ai, machine
learning algorithms can analyze

98
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:10,609
market trends, optimize portfolio
allocations, and identify investment

99
00:07:10,609 --> 00:07:17,589
opportunities far more rapidly than
human illness while maintaining risk

100
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:20,184
management parameters and conditions.

101
00:07:20,684 --> 00:07:27,044
Now I will walk you through a
case study of how AI transforms

102
00:07:27,974 --> 00:07:32,554
in income verification in
the loan application process.

103
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:36,864
We are focusing on optimizing
loan processing through ai,

104
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:38,814
augmented document handling.

105
00:07:39,314 --> 00:07:45,394
Income verification is a crucial
part of our loan processing.

106
00:07:45,894 --> 00:07:49,074
Let's examine mind why income
verification matters so much.

107
00:07:49,574 --> 00:07:53,204
It's not just about confirming
numbers, it's the foundation

108
00:07:53,234 --> 00:07:54,884
of responsible landing.

109
00:07:55,384 --> 00:08:00,994
For financial institutions, accurate
verification ensures risk management and

110
00:08:00,994 --> 00:08:07,314
compliance for customers, it determines
their boring capability and terms.

111
00:08:07,814 --> 00:08:10,094
Now let's address the pain point.

112
00:08:10,594 --> 00:08:15,244
The traditional manual verification
process creates multiple problems.

113
00:08:15,744 --> 00:08:21,914
Errors when human mystery documents delay
that frustrate customers and increase

114
00:08:22,364 --> 00:08:30,544
abundance rates, inefficiency that cost
financial institutions millions annually.

115
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:35,084
These three problems, errors,
delays, and inefficiencies.

116
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:39,209
Represent significant
business opportunities.

117
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:43,369
Our solution objective is straightforward.

118
00:08:43,869 --> 00:08:49,030
Automate income verification through
ai augmented document processing.

119
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,824
This is not about removing humans
from the equation entirely.

120
00:08:53,324 --> 00:09:01,364
But rather using AI to handle repetitive
tasks while allowing human experts to

121
00:09:01,364 --> 00:09:05,385
focus on exceptions and complex use cases.

122
00:09:05,885 --> 00:09:08,345
This objective addresses
all three problems.

123
00:09:08,345 --> 00:09:09,455
We have identified

124
00:09:09,955 --> 00:09:12,385
the document processing
component more closely.

125
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:14,245
We have six key.

126
00:09:14,745 --> 00:09:20,185
AI pipeline is starting from data capture
document, move through classification,

127
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:26,755
extraction, enrichment of the extracted
data review and validation, and

128
00:09:26,755 --> 00:09:29,395
finally consumption by the downstreams.

129
00:09:29,895 --> 00:09:31,815
Each step plays a crucial role.

130
00:09:32,315 --> 00:09:38,025
Aggregating documents, classifying type
of document, extracting information,

131
00:09:38,525 --> 00:09:44,785
enriching data from that information,
incorporating human validation when

132
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:50,219
and where needed, and sending verified
information downstream for consumption.

133
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:53,719
Implementing AI Strategies for Success.

134
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,900
Some are, some of the
best practices are here.

135
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,170
First one is identifying
key problems AI can solve.

136
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:05,260
The first step in AI implementation
is identifying where AI

137
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,730
can bring the most value.

138
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,579
AI works best for automated
automating repetitive tasks,

139
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,339
improving decision making.

140
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,739
And analyzing large, huge amount of data.

141
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:22,729
Examples include fraud detection
in banking, demand forecasting in

142
00:10:22,729 --> 00:10:29,189
retail, and document processing at
scale Planning, and bolting for AI

143
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:31,664
integration is the second best practice.

144
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:38,284
Implementing AI requires investment
in data tools, infrastructure,

145
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,524
and talent organizations.

146
00:10:40,524 --> 00:10:45,714
Should cons consider the cost
of cloud computing, AI software,

147
00:10:45,984 --> 00:10:48,384
and ongoing model maintenance

148
00:10:48,884 --> 00:10:53,529
planning should also include security,
compliance, and ethical considerations.

149
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:59,789
Best practice best Choosing the right
AI ML model is important and very

150
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:04,139
important to select the right AI ML
model based on the business need.

151
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,109
Some applications work best with
simple models like decision trees.

152
00:11:09,609 --> 00:11:13,769
While others requires deep
learning models, businesses must

153
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:17,189
consider accuracy, scalability.

154
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,624
And ease of implementation
when choosing models.

155
00:11:21,124 --> 00:11:26,074
And the last one is utilizing
ai, ml, SDKs and APIs.

156
00:11:26,574 --> 00:11:31,514
Many AI solutions don't have to be
built from scratch cloud providers

157
00:11:31,514 --> 00:11:38,879
like AWS Google and Microsoft offers
ai ml SDKs and a PS that can be.

158
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:40,459
Speed up the development.

159
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:46,809
These tools help business integrate AI
without extensive in-house expertise.

160
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:50,639
Of course, implementing AI
is not without challenges.

161
00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:56,409
Key considerations include data
privacy, security concerns, specifically

162
00:11:56,739 --> 00:11:58,734
with financial information and data.

163
00:11:59,234 --> 00:12:06,094
Ethical implications, regulatory
compliance requirements, and perhaps the

164
00:12:06,094 --> 00:12:12,134
most important managing organizations
change, which often proves more

165
00:12:12,134 --> 00:12:14,264
challenging than the technology itself.

166
00:12:14,764 --> 00:12:17,764
Looking ahead, the AI
landscape in financial services

167
00:12:17,764 --> 00:12:19,624
continue to evolve rapidly.

168
00:12:20,124 --> 00:12:25,224
Key trend include multi-model
document understanding,

169
00:12:25,724 --> 00:12:28,574
agenting AI document processing.

170
00:12:29,074 --> 00:12:33,234
Increasingly personalized
services and embedded AI.

171
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:37,784
Throughout the customer journey,
organizations should prepare

172
00:12:38,594 --> 00:12:40,274
for continuous innovation.

173
00:12:40,774 --> 00:12:46,534
Than viewing, rather than viewing
implementation as a one time project.

174
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:48,924
Thank you very much.
