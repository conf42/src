00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,680
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:06,600
My name is Alman ti and I am a senior
database administrator at Tech Axel.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,590
Over the years, I have had the
opportunity to work with numerous

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,190
financial clients, helping them
streamline their database environments

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,170
to achieve optimal performance.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,570
Today I am excited to.

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,600
Present on a topic that is crucial to
modern enterprise landscape leveraging

8
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:30,210
AI powered predictive analytics to
optimize enterprise database performance.

9
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:36,080
As many of enterprise databases are the
backbone of critical business operations.

10
00:00:36,544 --> 00:00:43,024
However, they often face performance
bottlenecks that can significantly affect

11
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,485
business continuity and user experience.

12
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:50,074
These issues can lead to downtime,
slow query responses, and

13
00:00:50,074 --> 00:00:52,114
ultimately lost opportunities.

14
00:00:52,714 --> 00:00:58,249
In this presentation, I will introduce
an AI powered framework for predictive

15
00:00:58,249 --> 00:01:02,854
analytics that is designed to tackle
these challenges by utilizing.

16
00:01:03,694 --> 00:01:07,714
Historical pattern analysis and
reinforcement learning techniques.

17
00:01:08,104 --> 00:01:13,265
This framework can predict performance
issues before they occur and provide

18
00:01:13,384 --> 00:01:15,725
real time optimization recommendations.

19
00:01:17,045 --> 00:01:21,515
One of the most powerful aspects
of this framework is its ability to

20
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:27,964
automate routine tasks such as query
indexing and performance monitoring.

21
00:01:28,654 --> 00:01:34,925
This automation allows DBS to
focus on more strategic decisions.

22
00:01:35,074 --> 00:01:39,635
While the AI system handles
RIP two optimization work.

23
00:01:39,994 --> 00:01:46,714
Ultimately, the collaborative potential
between human expertise and artificial

24
00:01:46,714 --> 00:01:52,804
intelligence is what sets this framework
apart by combining the sense of both.

25
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,119
We can maintain optimal database
performance in the face of increasingly

26
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,460
dynamic enterprise environments.

27
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:07,520
Let's dive into how this AI powered
solution can transform the way we approach

28
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,949
database performance optimization,

29
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,430
the challenge of enterprise
database performance.

30
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,020
Let's see about the
complexity of the database.

31
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,060
As enterprises continue to scale,
the complexity of their database

32
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,700
environments grows exponentially.

33
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,900
Enterprise databases are no
longer just a collection of tables

34
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,730
and rows in a single database.

35
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:39,240
Today's databases handle vast
amounts of data that span across

36
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,010
multiple systems and geographical
locations supporting a wide array of.

37
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,590
Business operations.

38
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,500
This includes everything from transaction
processing and data analytics to

39
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,120
customer relationship management
and enterprise resource planning.

40
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,410
The architecture has become more
distributed and multifaceted.

41
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,500
In many cases, organizations rely on
a combination of relational databases

42
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,890
like MySQL and Oracle alongside NoSQL
databases such as MongoDB or Cassandra.

43
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,130
To handle specific use cases.

44
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,960
Additionally, many enterprises are
transitioning to cloud-based solutions.

45
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:29,310
Integrating platforms like AWS
Azure and Google Cloud for better

46
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,780
scalability and efficiency.

47
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:38,610
However, this diverse ecosystem
introduces significant challenges

48
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,140
in managing performance.

49
00:03:40,915 --> 00:03:46,135
The different types of databases,
relational, NoSQL, and cloud databases

50
00:03:46,195 --> 00:03:51,505
have varying characteristics, including
different query optimizers, indexing

51
00:03:51,505 --> 00:03:54,145
methods, and storage architectures.

52
00:03:54,985 --> 00:04:01,675
This heterogene genetically makes
it difficult to apply uniform

53
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:06,235
performance management practices
across the entire environment.

54
00:04:07,105 --> 00:04:10,405
Managing these multiple
layers of databases often.

55
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:16,275
With thousands or even millions of
transactions per second requires not

56
00:04:16,275 --> 00:04:21,405
just expertise, but a more sophisticated
approach than traditional methods offer.

57
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:28,605
These systems must support concurrent
taxes by thousands of users,

58
00:04:28,755 --> 00:04:33,075
handle high velocity transactions,
and ensure real time analytics.

59
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:37,605
All of this must occur while
maintaining high availability,

60
00:04:38,055 --> 00:04:39,525
security, and scalability.

61
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,740
In addition to the technology
complexity, the business

62
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,950
demands are constantly shifting.

63
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,070
Enterprises are increasingly adopting.

64
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:57,240
Digital transformation strategies such
as e-commerce platforms, IOT systems, and

65
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,540
big data analytics, which generate new
types of data at an unprecedented rate.

66
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:09,570
This requires the database infrastructure
to not only scale in size, but also.

67
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:15,105
To adapt in real time to dynamic
workloads, the need for seamless

68
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:21,585
integration across these systems becomes
even more important, ensuring that data

69
00:05:21,585 --> 00:05:27,915
flows efficiently across departments,
regions, and even cloud providers.

70
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:35,625
Therefore, managing these complex systems
requires more than just knowing how

71
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,635
to tune individual database systems.

72
00:05:38,835 --> 00:05:45,465
It demands a holistic, agile approach
that can manage diverse technologies

73
00:05:45,465 --> 00:05:51,075
across multiple layers, keeping
all systems running efficiently and

74
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:55,365
ensuring that performance bottlenecks
don't disrupt business operations.

75
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,995
Limitations of traditional approaches.

76
00:05:59,835 --> 00:06:04,245
Now let's talk about how traditional
database performance management.

77
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:10,230
Approaches have struggled to keep
pace with this increasing complexity.

78
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:15,450
Historically, database administrators
have relied on manual reactive

79
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,380
methods to address performance issues.

80
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,840
Traditional performance
tuning was typically reactive.

81
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,010
Problems were identified
only after they had.

82
00:06:29,385 --> 00:06:30,945
Already impacted the system.

83
00:06:31,635 --> 00:06:37,425
This often meant dealing with performance
degradation, slow queries, or outages

84
00:06:37,425 --> 00:06:39,975
only after the damage was already done.

85
00:06:40,785 --> 00:06:47,415
For example, when query performance
begins to degrade, DBS might manually step

86
00:06:47,415 --> 00:06:53,055
through a diagnostic process, checking
execution plans, running performance

87
00:06:53,055 --> 00:06:57,495
tests, and tweaking settings in an
attempt to identify the root cause.

88
00:06:57,945 --> 00:06:58,545
However.

89
00:06:59,265 --> 00:07:03,675
This process can be time consuming
and error prone, especially when

90
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:07,425
working with complex systems
that span multiple environments.

91
00:07:08,745 --> 00:07:13,935
What might have seemed like a minor issue
can escalate, impacting everything from

92
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:16,305
transaction processing to user experience.

93
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:20,310
The consequences of this reactive
approach are far reaching

94
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,860
downtime becomes inevitable.

95
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,460
Systems may go offline during
troubleshooting, especially

96
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,730
when significant changes are
made to configurations in an

97
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,230
attempt to resolve issues.

98
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,880
Productivity laws is common, particularly
when users experience slow database

99
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,100
response times or application downtime.

100
00:07:41,955 --> 00:07:45,284
Affecting operations such as
order processing, customer

101
00:07:45,284 --> 00:07:47,235
support, and inventory management.

102
00:07:48,795 --> 00:07:53,505
Customer dissatisfaction can result
when critical systems such as e-commerce

103
00:07:53,505 --> 00:08:00,914
platforms like Amazon experience delays
or outages during peak traffic periods.

104
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,565
In summary.

105
00:08:03,285 --> 00:08:07,425
Traditional database performance
management approaches are ill-equipped

106
00:08:07,665 --> 00:08:12,435
to handle the complexity and scale
of modern enterprise environments.

107
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:19,065
They can only respond to issues after
they have already impacted the business,

108
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:24,585
leaving organizations in a perpetual
state of crisis management rather than

109
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:31,635
proactive performance optimization,
traditional database management phases.

110
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:37,530
Several inherent limitations
that contribute to performance

111
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,970
issues and inefficiencies.

112
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:43,740
One of the most significant challenges
is related to configuration issues.

113
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,800
20 per 27% of service disruptions
are cost by misconfigurations,

114
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,350
and 16% of system downtime can be
attributed to errors in configuration.

115
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,840
These problems arise because
the DBS rely on static.

116
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:08,100
Predefined configurations that fail
for adapt to dynamic business needs.

117
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,610
Traditional database management
places a substantial burden on DBS.

118
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,930
On average, 25% of DBS time is
spent on performance tuning,

119
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:20,490
but what's concerning is that.

120
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:26,475
About 67% of that time is spent on
manual trial and error approaches.

121
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:32,505
This trial and error process is time
consuming, inefficient, and often leads

122
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:38,280
to suboptimal outcomes, especially as
database environments grow more complex.

123
00:09:39,975 --> 00:09:42,735
Another major limitation
is static configuration.

124
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:49,305
In many enterprise environments, 87%
of database configuration parameters

125
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:53,985
remain unchanged, even though workloads
fluctuate due to business cycles,

126
00:09:53,985 --> 00:09:55,935
seasonability and other factors.

127
00:09:56,805 --> 00:10:02,115
This inflexibility means that databases
are either over provision leading to

128
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:04,815
unnecessary costs or under provision.

129
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,010
Resulting in performance
bottlenecks during peak periods.

130
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,710
Traditional approaches simply do
not account for the ever-changing

131
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:17,820
nature of enterprise operations,
leaving the system vulnerable to

132
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,740
inefficiencies and disruptions.

133
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,920
In summary, the traditional methods
of database management are react to

134
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,290
manual and rigid, which makes them ill
suited for today's rapidly evolving

135
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,260
and data intensive environments.

136
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,020
Now let's talk about a framework for
AI powered database optimization.

137
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:44,190
At the core of this AI powered
optimization system is a layered

138
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:48,240
architecture that is designed to
tackle the complexity of modern

139
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,800
enterprise database environments.

140
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:55,740
The framework is structured to
include distinct layers, software,

141
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,170
data collection, analysis, decision
making, and implementation by

142
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,819
creating abstraction layers.

143
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,130
This architecture ensures seamless
integration with diverse systems,

144
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:12,450
including relational databases, no
SQL systems and cloud platforms.

145
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:19,740
This modular design allows the
system to scale efficiently and adapt

146
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,665
to evolving business deals needs,
making it suitable for heterogeneous

147
00:11:24,665 --> 00:11:26,700
environments and complex workloads.

148
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,390
Historical.

149
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,940
Let's talk about historical
pattern analysis.

150
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,190
The framework builds comprehensive
knowledge basis for historical

151
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,150
performance data, such as query
execution, statistics, resource

152
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,250
utilization metrics, and system logs.

153
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:51,385
This historical analysis allows the system
to recognize recurring patterns providing.

154
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,930
A solid foundation for
identifying potential performance

155
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,250
issues before they occur.

156
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:03,580
By leveraging this data, the framework
enables proactive optimization,

157
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,470
tailored to the database needs.

158
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:13,300
So reinforcement learning models at
the heart of the system is adapt to

159
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:19,360
intelligence driven by reinforcement
learning this model continuously

160
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,100
learn from past experiences and
refine the predictions as new data

161
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,055
comes in this self-improvement.

162
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:33,235
Ensures that as the system encounters new
patterns or shifts in workload, it becomes

163
00:12:33,235 --> 00:12:38,155
increasingly accurate in its ability to
suggest effective optimizations over time.

164
00:12:40,255 --> 00:12:44,245
The realtime recommendations
framework generates.

165
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:49,719
Actionable optimization suggestions
in real time, allowing database

166
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:53,020
administrators to implement
changes quickly and effectively.

167
00:12:53,469 --> 00:12:57,640
These recommendations span areas such
as query indexing, memory distribution,

168
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,050
and resource allocation, ensuring
that performance is continually

169
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,935
optimized without requiring manual
trial and error adjustments.

170
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,579
In conclusion, the AI powered framework
provides a dynamic and flexible.

171
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:17,905
Solution for enterprise database
optimization using machine learning and

172
00:13:17,905 --> 00:13:22,555
reinforcement learning to continuously
monitor, analyze, and optimize

173
00:13:22,615 --> 00:13:24,445
database performance in real time.

174
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:29,315
So now let's say the performance
improvements for AI power techniques.

175
00:13:30,065 --> 00:13:35,045
So this graph highlights the significant
performance improvements that AI

176
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:39,005
powered techniques specifically
reinforcement learning can bring

177
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:40,565
to the database optimization.

178
00:13:41,135 --> 00:13:46,385
One of the most notable benefits
is query latency reduction, where

179
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:51,065
reinforcement learning approaches
can reduce latency by up to 70 to 80%

180
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:52,445
compared to traditional query optimizers.

181
00:13:54,245 --> 00:13:57,245
This improvement happens
quickly with training.

benefit from AI techniques.

186
00:14:12,444 --> 00:14:20,005
Traditional optimizers can typically
handle join order optimization for

187
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:25,615
queries involving 10 to 15 tables, but
AI models can manage up to 50 tables.

188
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:31,089
Far beyond the capabilities of
traditional methods, AI also excels
