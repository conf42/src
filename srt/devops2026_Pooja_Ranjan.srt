1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:00,890
Speaker 27: Hello.

2
00:00:00,949 --> 00:00:01,640
Hi everyone.

3
00:00:01,999 --> 00:00:03,440
This is Puja Ranjan.

4
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,950
I work in the software cloud providing
industry in the San Francisco Bay.

5
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:15,830
I have been working here for over a
decade and I'm very excited to be here

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,790
at the conference, 42 DevOps of 2026.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,960
What a great way to start the year.

8
00:00:22,335 --> 00:00:24,314
Without further ado, let's get started.

9
00:00:24,314 --> 00:00:27,225
I'll talk a little bit about myself
and then a little bit about the

10
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:30,715
topic I'm trying to cover something
that's very fundamental for DevOps

11
00:00:31,255 --> 00:00:34,754
and and yeah, you can reach out to
me and connect with me for questions.

12
00:00:35,565 --> 00:00:38,985
So let me share my screen
and we will get started.

13
00:00:39,485 --> 00:00:43,024
Okay, yeah, a little bit more
about me on the first slide.

14
00:00:43,034 --> 00:00:46,694
As I've mentioned, I am focusing
on delivering enterprise scale

15
00:00:46,694 --> 00:00:49,484
level SaaS software services.

16
00:00:49,865 --> 00:00:53,615
I have worked across different companies
that provide different kinds of

17
00:00:53,644 --> 00:00:58,035
microservices mostly in the B2B format.

18
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:03,275
My customers have largely been
other businesses educational

19
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:08,395
institutions, organizations, and
and yeah, other B2B businesses.

20
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:14,445
So coming to why am I choosing to
talk about what I'm talking about

21
00:01:14,445 --> 00:01:19,155
today is because of the impact that
it has on software as an industry.

22
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:24,805
So all of us have definitely heard about
like sas, software as a service model

23
00:01:24,855 --> 00:01:32,155
which is a cloud model where any software
that a provider builds is a built,

24
00:01:32,215 --> 00:01:37,015
licensed, delivered, and managed by the
provider or the owner of the software

25
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:39,115
and it's delivered of the internet.

26
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:45,585
It allows the end user to access
applications via a web browser or.

27
00:01:46,455 --> 00:01:51,145
They can have a subscription that
they can use and then install

28
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:53,275
or use that software locally.

29
00:01:54,065 --> 00:01:57,545
What are the benefits of using
the software service model?

30
00:01:57,545 --> 00:01:59,255
Obviously it helps you with costs.

31
00:01:59,255 --> 00:02:03,945
So smaller vendors, businesses
do not need to worry about.

32
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,420
Building, maintaining,
shipping their own software.

33
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,420
Smaller businesses who are trying
to sell smaller items or were

34
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:17,790
trying to run some sort of analysis
or data sciencey algorithms.

35
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,990
They do not need to worry about, building
their own infrastructure, maintaining

36
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,650
that infrastructure from scratch worrying
about security, reliability, all of that.

37
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:28,920
How do we.

38
00:02:29,785 --> 00:02:35,495
How do we provide this, all of these
things to an end user and then how

39
00:02:35,495 --> 00:02:38,105
do we continuously keep providing it?

40
00:02:38,765 --> 00:02:42,885
And then how do we maintain all
regulations and standards that are imposed

41
00:02:42,885 --> 00:02:47,945
by different organizations in different
companies and different countries.

42
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:51,445
So that's the summary
of what we're gonna do.

43
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,870
What we're gonna talk about here.

44
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,360
So why is this topic important?

45
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,500
Question number one.

46
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,020
It's very important
because SaaS is a market.

47
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,980
Hager, a market grabber in terms of.

48
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,420
In terms of revenue all software services
applications, if you look at the numbers

49
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,480
that the companies in the Silicon Valley
gen rate the number is upwards of three

50
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,360
50 billion US dollars in annual revenue.

51
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,700
And this delivery comes at
the cost of promising like

52
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,290
availability, service availability.

53
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,679
So when we are talking about
a small vendor who wants to.

54
00:03:29,929 --> 00:03:38,719
For example, host a small handcraft
website on an already existing platform.

55
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,740
They are agreeing to use that platform
as a service, and then the vendor

56
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,300
will have a contract for them.

57
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:50,820
Okay, we will keep your service
up and running for 99.9% of the

58
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,640
time, and this is the amount that
you will owe us for your usage.

59
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:54,839
Something like that.

60
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:55,619
A rental contract.

61
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:59,470
And also now this is the amount of
time we're saving through automation.

62
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,850
I'm gonna come to this a little later.

63
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:09,620
Before that, let's come to why is this why
is compliance and delivery all of these

64
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,770
important when you are a cloud vendor?

65
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:18,030
Working on the cloud provider
side, something that you will.

66
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:23,310
Deeply notice is that just
like every other software.

67
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,600
Delivery model software as a service
also follows like different different

68
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,130
stages of software delivery.

69
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,180
So if you are delivering SaaS for a, for
any, and any provider or vendor, what

70
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,500
you will see is that you have to follow
your SDLC steps, the software development

71
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,550
lifecycle steps one of the first one of
which could be your feature planning.

72
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,010
It could be followed by
architectural design.

73
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,140
And then we do talk about development.

74
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,930
We talk about automated testing,
we talk about deployment, and

75
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,780
then we talk about monitoring and
improving how the service works.

76
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,730
So here is where I would like to
get into a little bit of depth.

77
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:06,420
So as software in different stages
of software delivery, right?

78
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,835
There are different categories
of things that are important.

79
00:05:09,335 --> 00:05:14,185
And these different and there are
different stakeholders to every specific

80
00:05:14,185 --> 00:05:15,295
category that we're talking about.

81
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,945
For example, when we talk about the
first stage when we are trying to

82
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:23,865
gather requirements, like what is a good
requirement for a cloud vendor to deliver

83
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:29,645
it's usually gathered by a team of product
managers who have the nerve and the pulse

84
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:34,205
for what for what the market actually
wants, what the customer actually wants.

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,130
And these can, and a customer can
either approach them directly or there

86
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:47,250
are, and the current times, there's
so much AI tooling embedded into our

87
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:52,100
systems to determine what's the, what
next feature that the customer wants.

88
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,020
So we can stay ahead of the curve.

89
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,450
SOS data scientists.

90
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,640
Nowadays they use sophisticated tools
like large language data models to

91
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,550
define interesting patterns from
structured and unstructured data,

92
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,820
to predict the list of soon to be
most desirable software features.

93
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,920
And this can be in any industry
finance, healthcare, commerce

94
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,520
journalism, content creation.

95
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,550
Engineering, aviation planning
a travel, all these things.

96
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,170
So based on the data that's collected
in these stages, either through

97
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:27,220
automation or through or through
like direct customer interaction

98
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,630
a project plan is put together.

99
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:32,585
So we try to understand the
requirements that we're trying to build.

100
00:06:32,865 --> 00:06:34,905
What's the target audience
that we're building for?

101
00:06:34,905 --> 00:06:39,294
What's the projected adoption rate
that we think it'll be, and how will

102
00:06:39,294 --> 00:06:41,624
that be accepted in the industry?

103
00:06:41,624 --> 00:06:43,155
And how will we gather feedback basically.

104
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:46,674
So compliance now, if, now about
this rough stage, if we wanna

105
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:49,434
talk about how are we making
sure that compliance is in phase?

106
00:06:49,824 --> 00:06:53,494
So compliance at this stage
usually is a bunch of legalities.

107
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:57,364
So there are contracts that are assigned
between customers and clients that

108
00:06:57,364 --> 00:06:58,684
are some non-disclosure agreements.

109
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:03,444
Maybe it's more to do with the
legal side of things, but these

110
00:07:03,444 --> 00:07:07,189
contracts usually enforce the
SLA that people are looking for.

111
00:07:08,085 --> 00:07:11,474
And SLA is nothing but a
service level agreement.

112
00:07:12,414 --> 00:07:14,604
It's regarding the availability
and scaling requirements

113
00:07:14,604 --> 00:07:15,775
of a feature or service.

114
00:07:16,314 --> 00:07:20,454
For example, a simple contract and
a clause could be like, Hey, I will

115
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:27,915
host my website on your platform if
you guarantee me 99.99% availability.

116
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:31,955
So what is 99.99% availability?

117
00:07:32,225 --> 00:07:37,815
It's the difference between I would
say having a service up and running

118
00:07:37,815 --> 00:07:42,700
like your website, up and running for
less than maybe four hours annually.

119
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,480
So there could be some downtime that could
be due to outages that the vendor could

120
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:54,060
have migrations or just internet blips or
any other performance related bottleneck.

121
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:59,729
But in a nine, 9.95% agreement,
what we would say is that,

122
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:04,320
Hey, we want the service to be
up and running for less than.

123
00:08:04,995 --> 00:08:08,505
For always apart from like under
less than four hours per year.

124
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:12,255
But if you up the service level
contract and say, okay, now we're

125
00:08:12,255 --> 00:08:18,265
gonna talk about 99.99% availability,
what you're saying is that we want

126
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:24,655
the service to be up and running for
less than maybe 50 minutes in a year.

127
00:08:25,074 --> 00:08:26,275
So that's a lot of difference.

128
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:30,834
Although the number looks like pretty
similar, the difference is too much

129
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:36,864
because, for us to promise, and that's
why the most stable cloud providers are

130
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:38,514
able to provide most stable numbers.

131
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:43,564
So talking about, so this kind of
compliance and delivery standards that

132
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:47,675
have to be maintained, these level
contracts are assigned when we are doing

133
00:08:47,675 --> 00:08:51,444
like feature planning in step one, we
are talking about, Hey, can we keep

134
00:08:51,444 --> 00:08:52,795
the feature up and running for so long?

135
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:55,765
And if there is a, if there's a
deviation, then there are like

136
00:08:55,765 --> 00:08:58,824
various clauses in the contract to
make up for the monetary losses.

137
00:08:59,074 --> 00:09:02,375
Coming to the next stage software
architects, and now we're talking

138
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,025
about architectural design and review.

139
00:09:04,025 --> 00:09:07,025
So now we have we have listed it out.

140
00:09:07,025 --> 00:09:08,495
We know what we're trying to build.

141
00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:10,745
We have an agreement with the
customer on what to build.

142
00:09:11,015 --> 00:09:13,270
We have used certain AI and compliance.

143
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,890
Strategies to ensure that
everything is secured.

144
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,980
Now we're talking about what are we gonna
do when there are software architects?

145
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,140
When we are talking to about
designing the actual feature that

146
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,340
we're gonna deliver to a customer.

147
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,880
So software architects and senior
software engineers work to design

148
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,530
components of the feature or service.

149
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,640
There are multiple meetings and
sync ups to determine how are

150
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,080
we gonna do something like this.

151
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,885
You can say that there are, there
are unified modeling, language

152
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:44,845
diagrams and tools, chat bots that
you could use to actually write,

153
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:46,555
to actually draw these diagrams.

154
00:09:46,855 --> 00:09:50,275
What you're trying to see is that,
hey, are we being able to draw a

155
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:55,325
good behavioral diagram, the sequence
of how data is gonna flow between

156
00:09:55,325 --> 00:09:56,765
the different modules of your.

157
00:09:57,155 --> 00:10:03,525
Of your classes how well an object
oriented system and or what kind of code

158
00:10:03,525 --> 00:10:06,915
design patterns are you gonna use be the
builder pattern or the singleton pattern?

159
00:10:07,245 --> 00:10:08,235
Abstract pattern.

160
00:10:08,635 --> 00:10:12,115
There are a lot of tools that could be
used to automate the entire process.

161
00:10:12,115 --> 00:10:14,635
That could be rgo, it could
bevis, it could be Autodesk,

162
00:10:15,295 --> 00:10:17,530
and anything and compliance.

163
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:22,140
Compliance again at this stage would be
ensuring that everything that we are using

164
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:27,510
here is either open source or any third
party software that you're using here.

165
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,990
It's either open source which is
basically crowdsource software

166
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,740
for public consumption, or has
gone through proper licensed.

167
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,100
License, purchase procedures.

168
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,440
Compliance also involves like
doing a full security posture

169
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,880
review of the proposed software.

170
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,170
So we could send it to a
security design team internally.

171
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,550
And most organizations have a full
fledged security team that would do a

172
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,780
full fledged analysis of whatever service
or feature that you're trying to ship.

173
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,820
And they will tell you why.

174
00:10:58,615 --> 00:11:02,545
Should you do or should you not do
what you're doing to make sure that

175
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:06,215
we are not exposing the service or
any of these hosting requirements

176
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:07,565
to any sort of vulnerabilities?

177
00:11:07,965 --> 00:11:10,365
There could be denial of service,
there could be cross side scripting.

178
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:15,235
We do not want any of this to happen,
and that's why full review is conducted.

179
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:18,335
If any leaks are found, then those.

180
00:11:18,365 --> 00:11:22,385
Then the design goes back to the
architecture board, and then all

181
00:11:22,385 --> 00:11:25,895
these features are reviewed again
and ensure that we are complying with

182
00:11:26,495 --> 00:11:31,025
all the security postures within the
provider's organization to ensure that

183
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:34,805
we're not delivering anything that
is vulnerable to security attacks.

184
00:11:35,305 --> 00:11:39,325
So stage three here is largely
where you're actually trying to

185
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:42,055
build it, that this is when the
engineers become a lot more involved.

186
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:44,295
So we're talking about
software development time.

187
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:50,105
These will be people who will come
in, build their specific tool.

188
00:11:50,745 --> 00:11:55,245
They will use programming languages,
Java, Python, c plus, any version

189
00:11:55,245 --> 00:11:58,280
control system maybe GI per force.

190
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,190
Yeah.

191
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,250
Here a list of some tools
that are usually used in this

192
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,320
process that can be seen here.

193
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:09,450
So you're gonna use so SaaS delivery
systems heavily rely on application

194
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:13,800
program interfaces like APIs to enforce
the right bound boundaries of abstraction

195
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,740
between a user and a service interaction.

196
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,910
And companies invest heavily in
building and automating APIs.

197
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,670
So that's one thing.

198
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:29,100
And API specification generation
is also a specific tool set that

199
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,390
most companies have internally.

200
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,320
They have their own
internal versions of it.

201
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,460
So when we are trying to develop the
feature that a customer was asking us, or

202
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,880
something that was driven by the market,
how do you ensure that you are compliant?

203
00:12:43,705 --> 00:12:48,105
To industry standards country level
standards, how do you ensure that

204
00:12:48,105 --> 00:12:51,735
everything's compliant so that
we can uphold the quality level?

205
00:12:52,285 --> 00:12:55,735
It's usually largely depends
on, in the development stage.

206
00:12:55,735 --> 00:12:58,805
It largely depends on using
very good coding pro practices.

207
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,315
So proper data abstraction,
automated generation of.

208
00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:07,845
Maybe unit tests and validating a
smallest functional component in

209
00:13:07,845 --> 00:13:11,625
code like writing tests to validate
every small component, every feature

210
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:16,795
set, every code path in the flow is
important and reiterating to ensure

211
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,775
that the design document is agreed upon.

212
00:13:19,135 --> 00:13:23,185
If you are making a change, if it feels
technically infeasible or feels like

213
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:26,215
it's exposing a vulnerability, it can go
back to the architects or the security

214
00:13:26,215 --> 00:13:29,515
organization for a re review and.

215
00:13:30,195 --> 00:13:34,965
And then the design document is revised,
and then we can go ahead and make the

216
00:13:34,965 --> 00:13:36,975
new changes that developer is proposing.

217
00:13:37,225 --> 00:13:42,625
Then there are code, so CICD is, this
is exactly where CICD actually starts.

218
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:46,655
CICD actually means continuous integration
and continuous delivery ecosystem.

219
00:13:47,085 --> 00:13:48,030
Here is when, so once.

220
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:52,730
Once a developer is ready with
this new feature, or while he's

221
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,550
working on this new feature, he can
continuously keep pushing his code

222
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,450
into the company's remote repositories.

223
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,690
And from there we can
request for code reviews.

224
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,530
Code reviews are done to maintain the.

225
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,120
The standards of compliance.

226
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,580
So if there are, if coding is reducing
something that's, that might cause a

227
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,370
data leak or an, or a security leak.

228
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,030
Then in the modern, the current
times, there are a lot of.

229
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,450
AI code chat review bots that would
prompt and that would fix it, that

230
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,900
would prompt you the changes that
would make suggestions and sometimes

231
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:34,250
even fix like suggest small random
fixes in your, in, in, in your code.

232
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,280
And then it also goes
through another round of.

233
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,655
And then there are like linter tools.

234
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:40,075
Yeah.

235
00:14:40,135 --> 00:14:42,315
There are linter tools that bots look at.

236
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:46,495
It's like a bot that, cleans up
the code cleans up code like spaces

237
00:14:46,495 --> 00:14:49,525
instead of tabs, checks for code
vulnerabilities, like outdated

238
00:14:49,525 --> 00:14:51,505
package versions that could become.

239
00:14:51,755 --> 00:14:52,745
Security threats.

240
00:14:52,955 --> 00:14:56,465
So there are a lot of scanner tools
that run inside the system to make sure

241
00:14:56,465 --> 00:15:02,025
that we don't push either a vulnerable
version or any package dependency

242
00:15:02,025 --> 00:15:04,425
that could cause a security breach.

243
00:15:04,925 --> 00:15:07,205
Peer engineers are also heavily
involved with this process.

244
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:08,465
They hold a code review.

245
00:15:08,465 --> 00:15:15,135
Quality par pull requests are approved
after thoroughly reviewing them, and

246
00:15:15,135 --> 00:15:18,405
then merge into the main after merged
into the main master repository.

247
00:15:18,405 --> 00:15:19,695
After all these checks are complete.

248
00:15:20,195 --> 00:15:27,405
So stage four is where compliance, so
going back to this diagram these steps.

249
00:15:27,405 --> 00:15:30,375
So now what we are saying is
that we are building a code.

250
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,645
We are making sure that we have gathered
our requirements from product teams.

251
00:15:33,645 --> 00:15:36,785
We have had several design meeting rounds.

252
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:37,835
We've done all of that.

253
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,880
We are now into development.

254
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,290
We are almost code complete.

255
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,670
Our product is almost ready to go
out, but that is where we we start

256
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,910
looking at another very critical
phase in this process, which is

257
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,000
called the comp quality deliverable.

258
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,200
So how do we automate and test
everything that we are building?

259
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,430
We need to write comprehensive test suites
to validate functionality, performance,

260
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,875
compliance requirements, and so on.

261
00:16:03,805 --> 00:16:09,415
So in this stage, what we are doing is
that we are shifting our focus on quality.

262
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:15,035
What we are seeing is that now we are
gonna conduct like very rigorous tests,

263
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:18,695
functional tests, integration tests,
regression tests and security tests.

264
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:24,545
We're gonna write test code
using J Unit, moca, JMeter, A

265
00:16:24,545 --> 00:16:25,990
lot of these tools out there.

266
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,970
Some of these auto also auto
generate some amount of code.

267
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:34,180
And then we are gonna run these
tests on the new code that we have

268
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,930
written, and we'll gonna run it on
the code that was existing to make

269
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,645
sure that we haven't introduced a
new bug in this process of building.

270
00:16:41,905 --> 00:16:46,395
We, there are again, and there are
different code coverage tools like Clover.

271
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:50,295
What they ensure is that we
are at least maintaining code

272
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:52,095
coverage in terms of testing.

273
00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:58,755
The lines of code that we have written
at least 95% or above code is it's the

274
00:16:58,755 --> 00:17:00,345
standard industry practice that we do.

275
00:17:00,585 --> 00:17:02,595
We want test coverage
that goes across like.

276
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,710
Always above 95%.

277
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,420
So we know that our the code that
we're shipping out is less buggy.

278
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,450
So I would like to actually,
yeah, let's talk about this

279
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,530
a little more, to understand.

280
00:17:14,425 --> 00:17:15,235
Software testing.

281
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:19,525
I would say there are two broad
categories, so we want to ensure that

282
00:17:19,525 --> 00:17:23,045
because these are paid customers that we
are shipping to as a vendor you want to

283
00:17:23,045 --> 00:17:27,395
ensure that code that you have written
is very thoroughly written and tested.

284
00:17:27,895 --> 00:17:31,785
There are two categories here broadly
black box testing and white box testing.

285
00:17:31,815 --> 00:17:36,375
What you could say black box is where the
component that is being built, whatever

286
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:40,095
feature or service that you're building
is treated as just as a functional unit.

287
00:17:40,395 --> 00:17:44,325
So without any, without worrying about
any internal implementation, your test

288
00:17:44,325 --> 00:17:47,595
cases are purely designed based on the
product documentation that you have,

289
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:51,835
like the end to end user functionality
that the service is supposed to provide.

290
00:17:52,085 --> 00:17:55,715
And then you do some stress tests to
ensure that there are no outliers.

291
00:17:56,165 --> 00:18:02,045
So central organizations cloud providers
these days use orchestration services

292
00:18:02,045 --> 00:18:06,335
like Kubernetes to Containerize and
Alize, the running of functional tests.

293
00:18:07,285 --> 00:18:11,575
And to continuously keep running
it in their production environments

294
00:18:11,885 --> 00:18:13,055
back to back all the time.

295
00:18:13,605 --> 00:18:14,955
And no button click is required.

296
00:18:14,955 --> 00:18:16,065
It's totally touchless.

297
00:18:16,425 --> 00:18:21,425
And, or you can use like Aron job
sequence program, something like Aron

298
00:18:21,425 --> 00:18:25,505
job sequence into your systems to
make sure that tests run against, your

299
00:18:25,515 --> 00:18:26,460
production environments every few minutes.

300
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:29,650
That's what black box testing does.

301
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:35,260
And then when we talk about white box
testing here we are also, yeah, so

302
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:40,140
these are the all the testing dependency
checks, static analysis that we do if

303
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,390
we talk about white box testing now.

304
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:48,590
So white box testing is, more evolved test
plan and focuses on code workflows, and it

305
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:54,470
makes sure that you catch issues like an
finite loop null point or exception, and

306
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,240
you prevent the wastage of crossing time.

307
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,420
Sustainability is a big deal,
so we'll talk about that later.

308
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,935
But we want to write.

309
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:07,015
Code that is optimized and that has
the minimal amount of execution time

310
00:19:07,405 --> 00:19:13,085
to, so for the user can have a faster
processing time and faster reaction time.

311
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,835
And that will mean that we are providing
you with a good user experience.

312
00:19:17,565 --> 00:19:21,015
And we are also optimizing the usage
of the underlying hardware that we are

313
00:19:21,175 --> 00:19:22,465
that we are hosting the service on.

314
00:19:22,965 --> 00:19:27,785
So talking about certain standards
that now when we talk about compliance

315
00:19:27,785 --> 00:19:31,875
and when it comes to, so in us most
of the times there are a bunch of,

316
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:37,235
we spoke quite a few data governance
standards, but there are two specific

317
00:19:37,235 --> 00:19:38,555
standards that I would like to call out.

318
00:19:39,155 --> 00:19:41,795
One is the SOX compliance standard.

319
00:19:41,795 --> 00:19:47,165
It's like a federal regulatory standard
that all SaaS provider companies all

320
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:48,815
cloud provider companies have to stick to.

321
00:19:49,325 --> 00:19:53,605
And this act enforces that robust
testing of software components

322
00:19:53,605 --> 00:19:55,495
with clear defined end results.

323
00:19:55,495 --> 00:20:00,445
And goals have to be documented in your
system, and they have to be available

324
00:20:00,445 --> 00:20:01,705
if and when, and audit it happens.

325
00:20:01,945 --> 00:20:04,405
So every ticket, every feature
that you're building should have a

326
00:20:04,405 --> 00:20:05,845
well-defined acceptance criteria.

327
00:20:06,575 --> 00:20:14,025
On when is this product or the service
declared or acceptably complete, for the

328
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:15,975
end user, that criteria has to be defined.

329
00:20:15,975 --> 00:20:18,285
And then you have to explain
how do you meet that?

330
00:20:18,705 --> 00:20:20,715
And then these, and you have to document.

331
00:20:20,715 --> 00:20:22,155
You can document them in any form.

332
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:25,515
You can have any internal tool for
documentation, or we could use standard

333
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:29,235
tools like Jira where they come in
with these specific fields and you

334
00:20:29,235 --> 00:20:30,675
can document those answers there.

335
00:20:31,455 --> 00:20:34,485
And these results have to be available
all the time for audits if needed.

336
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:38,185
There's another compliance standard
that a lot that's really important,

337
00:20:38,185 --> 00:20:44,375
especially for companies that
provide any sort of federal services.

338
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:48,195
So the United States a lot
of cloud providing companies

339
00:20:48,195 --> 00:20:49,905
or database companies or.

340
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,320
A third party company provide
services to the federal government.

341
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,750
And of course, data there is highly
secure and has to has to be, has to jump

342
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:03,640
through a lot more security loopholes for
anybody to even get access to deploy or

343
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,400
maintain a service for these customers.

344
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,750
But the one standard that they
specifically ask for is a VPA compliance,

345
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,800
which is called a voluntary product
accessibility template Compliance.

346
00:21:15,535 --> 00:21:20,735
What happens, the requirement of
this template is that they want us

347
00:21:20,735 --> 00:21:26,465
to keep any service or any offering
inclusive to people who have any

348
00:21:26,465 --> 00:21:28,805
visual or audio deficiencies.

349
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:34,755
So you are supposed to conduct a
other test of your software system and

350
00:21:34,755 --> 00:21:38,745
you could use tools like the screen
reader, and then you are supposed

351
00:21:38,745 --> 00:21:42,435
to document all your results into
an accessibility conforming report.

352
00:21:43,355 --> 00:21:48,815
And generate generate like screenshots
of all your service endpoints that

353
00:21:48,815 --> 00:21:50,555
are accessible to a customer show.

354
00:21:50,555 --> 00:21:54,545
How, and this applies to the UI bits
of it, so not the API interactions,

355
00:21:54,545 --> 00:21:57,725
but the UI part of whatever you
are delivering to a customer.

356
00:21:58,235 --> 00:21:59,705
All those things have to be access.

357
00:21:59,955 --> 00:22:02,595
So the, these standards have to
be met, and that's why there are

358
00:22:02,595 --> 00:22:06,185
different, again, there are different
tools that companies use to to make

359
00:22:06,185 --> 00:22:07,445
sure that these standards are met.

360
00:22:08,135 --> 00:22:10,955
And again, these can be audited
at any point of time, and you will

361
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:13,095
have to be ready with reports.

362
00:22:13,425 --> 00:22:18,240
And these these compliance certifications
are regenerated every year.

363
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,640
So the evaluation could happen
at random time, but they

364
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,840
definitely happen year after year.

365
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:26,170
So yeah, we spoke about service
reliability bit at the beginning.

366
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,580
What's the difference
between 99.99 versus 99.95?

367
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:36,440
Some what's, why are we trying to
automate these, all these workflows here?

368
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,720
So just to wrap up that last stage,
and then I want to tie this back

369
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,400
into this one, into this stage.

370
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:48,200
So when now that you've built and shipped
your service, you're ready to ship it

371
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,310
out you're using, you, you are gonna go
and do some CICD kind of deployment where

372
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:56,100
you use a deployment tool, GitLab Bamboo.

373
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:00,430
You build it, you use Python bash
strips to provide assert logic, confirm

374
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,110
that all automated tests have passed.

375
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:06,980
You're now pushing it using your,
you may might want to do some

376
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,570
low test using Locust or J Meter.

377
00:23:09,365 --> 00:23:12,815
And then so that you can spawn
like millions of process threads

378
00:23:12,815 --> 00:23:16,055
or user threads per second and
mimic like, how would a real end

379
00:23:16,055 --> 00:23:17,915
user perform in these situations?

380
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:22,515
Once you have, and this is essential
for us to confirm that our SLA

381
00:23:22,995 --> 00:23:25,575
that we are prompting, the customer
will actually be available.

382
00:23:26,075 --> 00:23:30,215
So compliance standards not only apply
to successful availability, but also

383
00:23:30,215 --> 00:23:32,015
to the latency of server requests.

384
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:37,775
So every request response that is expected
to succeed within 500 milliseconds.

385
00:23:38,225 --> 00:23:44,135
So if you're saying that 70% of
calls and address 70% of the API

386
00:23:44,165 --> 00:23:47,885
calls or UI call made by a customer,
a request made by a customer

387
00:23:48,305 --> 00:23:50,465
should take under 500 milliseconds.

388
00:23:50,585 --> 00:23:52,535
And after all these rigorous tests.

389
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:55,385
We are now deploying our software.

390
00:23:55,445 --> 00:24:00,105
Once it passes these tests, we are now
deploying it to every customer region

391
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:04,665
or like a geographical region where our
data centers and warehouses are located.

392
00:24:04,955 --> 00:24:08,135
The final stage where we have now
deployed a service and we are getting

393
00:24:08,135 --> 00:24:11,705
customer feedback, we're trying to
improve again, at any point, the SDLC

394
00:24:11,705 --> 00:24:16,565
lifecycle goes back to stage one to stage.

395
00:24:17,105 --> 00:24:17,435
Here.

396
00:24:17,825 --> 00:24:18,095
Yeah.

397
00:24:18,245 --> 00:24:21,695
So once we have tested production
monitoring is happening now at any

398
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:25,775
point, it can go back to in the loop
for the stages, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 again.

399
00:24:26,075 --> 00:24:31,045
So we continuously keep improving
and optimizing our service while

400
00:24:31,045 --> 00:24:35,125
maintaining our service, like
productively operationally to keep

401
00:24:35,215 --> 00:24:38,635
production, operational usage data and
metrics are the most important thing.

402
00:24:39,115 --> 00:24:40,765
So tracking it is.

403
00:24:41,015 --> 00:24:43,805
Possible by doing, by
using tools like Grafana.

404
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:48,535
You can save your data in for data
warehouses and then you can mine it

405
00:24:49,045 --> 00:24:53,665
for interesting usage patterns that are
tools like CCA that are help, that will

406
00:24:53,665 --> 00:24:57,685
help you pre-process this data and then
feed it to data models and then find

407
00:24:57,685 --> 00:25:01,015
interesting correlations that are several
services out there in the market that

408
00:25:01,015 --> 00:25:03,415
help you run these kind of analysis.

409
00:25:03,985 --> 00:25:04,705
Compliance.

410
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,960
At this stage is largely like data
handling, governance, every possible

411
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,680
access control, isolation between
customer and data, and between

412
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,000
customer data, so it's implemented.

413
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,770
Logging tools are audited for
privacy software upgrades, dependent

414
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:22,820
packages, version upgrades, or
constantly deployed to ensure

415
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,770
latest and best security posture.

416
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:28,015
Horizontal scaling is possible
sometimes because you want

417
00:25:28,015 --> 00:25:30,385
to add more configurations.

418
00:25:30,915 --> 00:25:36,135
Or add more servers to the fleet to deal
with the growing requests of servers.

419
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:37,605
And then vertical scaling is possible.

420
00:25:37,605 --> 00:25:40,605
Sometimes we just add more memory and
more processing to an existing server.

421
00:25:40,905 --> 00:25:44,535
So this, all the scaling of this
is dependent on the predicted load.

422
00:25:44,895 --> 00:25:48,495
We get this load information from
all the AI tools that we run.

423
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:52,795
Tools like Jira, sd, they help us
like set up alarms if something

424
00:25:52,795 --> 00:25:54,025
goes wrong, if our service.

425
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,830
If there's less disk space list on the
left, on the stove, for example, it can

426
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:02,725
alarm us and tell us like, Hey, you just
have 30% memory available on this one.

427
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,685
So these are so data governance.

428
00:26:05,925 --> 00:26:09,765
So once we deal with all these challenges
or we continuously keep dealing with all

429
00:26:09,765 --> 00:26:14,625
these challenges in production monitoring,
why do we deal with all of these now?

430
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:20,345
The point of managing all these
automations and trustworthy delivery is

431
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:23,075
for these three, three strong reasons.

432
00:26:23,105 --> 00:26:24,425
One is trustworthy delivery.

433
00:26:24,425 --> 00:26:28,025
So we are, we want be sure that we
are compliant in every way so that a

434
00:26:28,025 --> 00:26:32,825
customer can place that full trust in
us and position, and we could be one

435
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,145
of the strong players in the market.

436
00:26:34,695 --> 00:26:36,495
The second is to save engineer time.

437
00:26:36,745 --> 00:26:39,685
Because production, because really
production and maintenance is an

438
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:41,575
ongoing effort, it's constant.

439
00:26:41,575 --> 00:26:42,535
It never ends.

440
00:26:42,595 --> 00:26:43,735
It never ever ends.

441
00:26:44,075 --> 00:26:49,535
And in a cloud providing company
like engineers spend over 30% of

442
00:26:49,535 --> 00:26:51,755
the time just maintaining software.

443
00:26:52,655 --> 00:26:55,115
And then there are full DevOps
teams deployed for this.

444
00:26:55,415 --> 00:26:59,465
So we want to save the time, but we
want to keep it very we want to keep

445
00:26:59,465 --> 00:27:03,435
it very streamlined and we want to
keep optimize and we want to keep

446
00:27:03,435 --> 00:27:04,515
automating everything that can be.

447
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,760
Automated.

448
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:10,290
So this, our build to our, the
time that it takes for us to build

449
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,140
something and to ship something
is very minimal and very optimal.

450
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,410
And of course for
scalability in the future.

451
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:19,370
So given that every cloud riding
company is actually just growing and

452
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:24,250
growing, and there are several there
are several different, the data centers

453
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,750
that we are expanding to globally.

454
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:29,510
You want to minimize the amount of
time it takes for you to build in

455
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:32,150
one region and then ship and deploy
to every other region in the world.

456
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:36,170
Yeah, that's the summary of how
things work in a cloud provider

457
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,580
setup for a SaaS company.

458
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,040
The key takeaways usually are that,
yeah, you start working on these

459
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,940
compliance requirements as early as
possible, integrated into every step

460
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,450
of your journey as you are going
through development and shipping.

461
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,710
You put it under monitor, you.

462
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,490
Have quantifiable metrics that
you measure at every point of

463
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,230
time you instrument your code.

464
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,800
You surface out all these all these.

465
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:02,590
Metrics that you need to keep your service
to measure the quality of your service.

466
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:06,340
You automate as much as you can, free
up more engineer time, and have a more

467
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,870
streamlined way of deploying things.

468
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:11,590
And that automatically brings us to the
four point, which is sustainability.

469
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,590
So the less time you spend, the more
optimized your hardware and your

470
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:18,800
software is the smaller your carbon
footprint will be, and you will continue

471
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,190
shipping things to your customers on
time in the most efficient manner.

472
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,920
Yeah, that's pretty much it for me folks.

473
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:27,800
Thank you for your time.

474
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,650
Thank you DevOps, for letting me present.

475
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,460
Talk to y'all in another conference.

476
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,390
Thank you.

477
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:35,160
Bye.
