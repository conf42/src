1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,290
Good morning or good afternoon everyone.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,810
My name is Pravin Kumar.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:14,860
I have over 14 years of experience
in IT industry, and I currently serve

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,960
as vice president of engineering in
the field of financial technology.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,610
Today I'll be talking
about the revolution.

6
00:00:24,045 --> 00:00:31,245
We are witnessing in platform engineering
specifically how AI is reshaping

7
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:36,765
CICD pipelines, developer experience
and infrastructure management.

8
00:00:37,265 --> 00:00:42,965
We are at a moment where manual
reactive processes are giving way to

9
00:00:43,145 --> 00:00:46,355
proactive intelligence automation.

10
00:00:46,855 --> 00:00:50,065
By the end of this
talk, I want you to see.

11
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:56,335
Not only the technical frameworks
making this possible, but also the

12
00:00:56,335 --> 00:01:02,635
cultural and strategic shifts needed
to embrace AI driven platforms.

13
00:01:03,135 --> 00:01:06,825
Traditionally, platform
engineering was about efficiency

14
00:01:07,325 --> 00:01:12,545
and reputability, spinning up
environments, managing orchestration,

15
00:01:13,055 --> 00:01:15,275
providing stable CICD foundations.

16
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:20,085
But systems today are distributed
and they are micro, front and

17
00:01:20,085 --> 00:01:22,244
heavy, and globally scaled.

18
00:01:22,744 --> 00:01:29,645
The shift we are seeing now is
that AI is no longer just a tool

19
00:01:30,274 --> 00:01:31,654
for application development.

20
00:01:32,374 --> 00:01:38,214
It's actually becoming part of the
platform itself with AI platforms.

21
00:01:38,214 --> 00:01:43,924
Stop being a reactive s. And
becoming proactive collaborators and

22
00:01:43,924 --> 00:01:49,444
anticipating needs self-optimizing
and continuously improving.

23
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:53,059
Let's be honest, traditional
platforms struggle at scale.

24
00:01:53,559 --> 00:02:00,394
Too much manual configuration monitoring
that tells you what went wrong, but not.

25
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:02,859
What's about to go wrong?

26
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:09,359
Developers spending more time debugging
infrastructure than writing features.

27
00:02:09,859 --> 00:02:14,509
The real pain point here is
complexity beyond human scale.

28
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:20,259
When you have got hundreds of
microservices interacting, no human

29
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:26,649
operator or team of them can model
those relationships intuitively.

30
00:02:27,149 --> 00:02:27,749
That's where.

31
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:34,889
AI brings incredible value by
detecting unseen patterns and

32
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:36,929
automating routine pain points.

33
00:02:37,429 --> 00:02:45,824
So how AI actually help us think of it
as adding predictive and to intelligence

34
00:02:46,064 --> 00:02:49,114
layers and do it across the stack.

35
00:02:49,614 --> 00:02:51,594
AI observes system data.

36
00:02:52,424 --> 00:02:59,264
In real time learns from historic behavior
and starts making adjustments proactively

37
00:02:59,764 --> 00:03:06,544
scaling before traffic hits, balancing
resources before bottleneck occurs, or

38
00:03:06,544 --> 00:03:09,304
adapting based on business criticality.

39
00:03:09,804 --> 00:03:11,454
This is more than monitoring.

40
00:03:11,954 --> 00:03:13,964
It's like a closed loop optimization.

41
00:03:14,564 --> 00:03:18,014
Every cycle of data makes
the platform smarter.

42
00:03:18,514 --> 00:03:22,324
Feeding a S loop of
performance and adaptability.

43
00:03:22,824 --> 00:03:25,914
So I would like to talk about
these architectural patterns,

44
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,824
federated AI models.

45
00:03:28,214 --> 00:03:32,384
So these federated AI models help
keeping decision making distributed

46
00:03:32,884 --> 00:03:34,234
close to where the action is.

47
00:03:35,165 --> 00:03:37,684
So this helps in avoiding
central bottle line.

48
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:41,004
And the next pattern is the
AI orchestration layers.

49
00:03:41,844 --> 00:03:46,694
These help in serving as the brain
of the platform, seeing the ecosystem

50
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:51,224
globally making optimizations,
no individual service cut.

51
00:03:51,724 --> 00:03:55,984
Coming to even driven intelligence,
these help in responding

52
00:03:55,984 --> 00:03:58,174
to context in real time.

53
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:02,314
Imagine auto healing
triggered not on downtime.

54
00:04:02,764 --> 00:04:04,924
But on predictive anomaly detection.

55
00:04:05,424 --> 00:04:11,394
And the last pattern is the edge based
processing, which help in pushing AI

56
00:04:11,814 --> 00:04:13,974
right to the developer of Workflow Edge.

57
00:04:14,474 --> 00:04:17,834
Faster code reviews faster,
CICD feedback loops.

58
00:04:18,334 --> 00:04:24,309
So all these patterns together enable
a platform that feels about almost

59
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:26,890
alive in how it reacts and disappear.

60
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,319
Let's make this real.

61
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:31,489
In e-commerce, timing is everything.

62
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,979
You don't want to lose customers
because servers crash on a Black Friday.

63
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:41,919
AI driven infrastructure can
autoscale resources preemptive,

64
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:47,559
prioritize critical fixes during
peak time, and even handle rollbacks

65
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:50,679
autonomously when a buggy releases.

66
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,224
Ships through CICD.

67
00:04:53,154 --> 00:04:58,044
That's the difference between downtime,
which costs millions per minute

68
00:04:58,374 --> 00:05:00,624
and seamless customer experience.

69
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:04,094
Financial systems face
a different pain point.

70
00:05:04,814 --> 00:05:05,984
Compliance and security.

71
00:05:06,484 --> 00:05:10,504
AI driven platforms allow
continuous compliance, auditing,

72
00:05:11,164 --> 00:05:14,939
automated secure provisioning
and predictive risk detection.

73
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:22,279
What that means is not just faster
systems, but trustworthy systems.

74
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:26,989
So in finance, intelligence
isn't just about efficiency.

75
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:30,679
It's about avoiding catastrophic mistakes.

76
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:33,519
Now, let's talk about the developer.

77
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:39,569
If you are an enterprise team, reducing
cognitive load on the developer is good.

78
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:46,569
AI can tailor pipelines, recommend
workflow, operations, and even

79
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:49,899
learn from personal coding patterns.

80
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:56,859
It's not about replacing developer
decision making, it's about augmenting

81
00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:01,859
creativity by removing the friction,
the benefit, faster delivery,

82
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:04,114
higher quality, and happier team.

83
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,224
Let's talk about the
implementation strategies.

84
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:10,494
This transition doesn't happen overnight.

85
00:06:11,394 --> 00:06:14,034
The best path is progressive adoption.

86
00:06:14,534 --> 00:06:20,084
Start small with intelligent
service measures that learn

87
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:26,224
anomaly patterns, and then layer on
automated performance tuning applied

88
00:06:26,224 --> 00:06:28,769
gradually rather than aggressively.

89
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:34,819
And finally enhance developer
workflows with EI assistance.

90
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:40,839
The key is building trust, both
in the algorithms and with the

91
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:43,899
engines, engineers who depend on them

92
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,329
technical architecture.

93
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:51,859
A good architecture is what prevents AI
driven systems from becoming black box.

94
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:57,699
That means careful data pipelines,
rigorous model deployment workflows,

95
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:02,889
and the ability to roll back AI
models just like application code.

96
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:07,739
Without these guardrails, AI becomes
a liability instead of an enabler.

97
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:13,189
Security in AI systems is just,
it's not just about infrastructure.

98
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:15,829
It extends to the models themselves.

99
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:20,619
Models are vulnerable to
poisoning and virtual effects.

100
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:24,399
So there's a need for
regulatory considerations

101
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,529
which demand explainability.

102
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:31,989
If your AI engine denies the
transaction or reconfigures

103
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:34,269
resources, you must know why.

104
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:40,434
Audit, explainability and strong privacy
practices are non-negotiable foundations.

105
00:07:41,124 --> 00:07:41,394
It's

106
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:42,764
looking ahead.

107
00:07:43,364 --> 00:07:48,614
We are heading towards autonomous
platforms environment that adjusts

108
00:07:48,614 --> 00:07:50,924
themselves with minimal human touch.

109
00:07:51,424 --> 00:07:57,179
Think of it as a self-driving car, but
for platforms beyond that, the integration

110
00:07:57,179 --> 00:08:02,759
of quantum computing and advanced
neural networks promises optimization

111
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,159
levels we can't even simulate today.

112
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:12,019
In short, the AI driven platform
you adopt now is laying groundwork

113
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:14,809
for a self evolving ecosystem.

114
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:19,349
To sum it up, AI driven platforms
represent a fundamental shift.

115
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:25,699
We move from manual firefighting
to pro proactive optimization, from

116
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:29,749
static environments to self-learning
systems, and from developer burden.

117
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,789
To developer empowerment.

118
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:36,519
The organizations that embrace
this shift are not just

119
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:38,949
modernizing these tool chains.

120
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:43,239
They are building the foundational
autonomous development

121
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:44,679
environments of tomorrow.

122
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:51,749
The future is collaborative where human
creativity and AI performance combined to

123
00:08:51,749 --> 00:08:54,599
deliver results we couldn't achieve alone.

124
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:55,519
Thank you.
