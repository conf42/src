1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,430
Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,840
Thank you for being here today.

3
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,680
My name is Siva Prakash, and it's a
genuine pleasure to speak with you

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,910
about what I believe is the next great
frontier in financial technologies.

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,660
For over two decades, I have had
the privilege of working within

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,139
the IT landscape, witnessing
wave after wave of innovation.

7
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:22,130
In my current role, I see firsthand
the immense computational challenges.

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,050
Point where the limits of
classical computings are becoming

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,650
increasingly apparent just
as a new paradigm is downing.

10
00:00:29,889 --> 00:00:33,489
Today we are going to explore
that paradigm, the integration of

11
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:37,539
quantum computing principles with
real-time financial data processing.

12
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,039
We will be looking at a future
powered by quantum enhanced real-time

13
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:47,019
data shaping and feature stores
are future design for ultra low

14
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:49,870
latency demands of modern finance.

15
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,020
Understand where we are going.

16
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,080
We first need to appreciate where we are.

17
00:00:55,769 --> 00:01:00,320
The world of finance today is
convergence of four powerful forces.

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,620
First, the demand from
financial application.

19
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,920
We are no longer in an era
of end of batch processing.

20
00:01:07,655 --> 00:01:11,105
Finance demands microsecond level
decision, whether in high frequency

21
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:15,625
trading, realtime product preventions,
or dynamic risk assessment.

22
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:19,975
This is fueled by data streaming
technologies, which act as the global

23
00:01:19,975 --> 00:01:25,345
financial system circulatory system,
enabling a continuous realtime flow of

24
00:01:25,345 --> 00:01:27,550
market data, transactions and emails.

25
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:33,070
To make sense of this data, we rely
on feature stores, which centralizes.

26
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,380
The critical data ingredients, the
features that power our machine learning

27
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,050
models consistently and at scale.

28
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:46,440
And now entering this quantum computing,
which promises a fundamentally new

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,600
way to compute, leverage the principle
of quantum mechanics for powerful

30
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,790
exploration.

31
00:01:52,795 --> 00:01:56,325
The reason this conversion is so
critical is because we're hitting a ball.

32
00:01:56,655 --> 00:01:59,025
We call it the classical limitations.

33
00:01:59,355 --> 00:02:04,470
For decades, we have relied on Moore
and advanced parallelization with

34
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,679
GPUs to keep up the data deluge.

35
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,009
But we are now facing
insurmountable BO bottlenecks.

36
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,700
The sheer volume of data from
market feeds news and alternative

37
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,910
sources one challenge, but the
bigger challenge is complexity.

38
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,140
When we analyze financial
data sets with hundreds of

39
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,369
correlating risk across finding.

40
00:02:25,869 --> 00:02:29,169
Pattern across millions of
transaction, the computational

41
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:31,359
complexity through exponentially.

42
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:36,249
This is not a linear problem for a
classical computer doubling the number

43
00:02:36,249 --> 00:02:40,479
of variable cans, square, or even
queue the time needed for a solution.

44
00:02:40,779 --> 00:02:44,559
At a certain point, a realtime processing
becomes practically impossible.

45
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:49,029
We can build bigger data center,
but we can't out architect the map.

46
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:54,339
That is where we need a new tool, a new
approach, and the approach is quantum.

47
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:58,029
So what makes quantum
computing so different?

48
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:00,099
Let's demy and demystify it.

49
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:02,049
Imagine a classical computer bit.

50
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:03,519
It's like a light switch.

51
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:05,289
It can be either on or off.

52
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:06,909
It's binary and definite.

53
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:10,659
A quantum bit or qubit is
fundamentally different.

54
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:14,109
Think of it more like a bimmer switch.

55
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:19,809
It can be on off or crucially in
a state of superposition, a blend

56
00:03:19,809 --> 00:03:21,640
of both on and off simultaneously.

57
00:03:22,029 --> 00:03:28,119
This property of superposition is the
first key to quantum power because Abit

58
00:03:28,119 --> 00:03:30,309
can hold multiple values at once a.

59
00:03:30,809 --> 00:03:33,269
Number of possibilities concurrently.

60
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:37,379
While a classical computer checks
scenarios one by one, a quantum computer

61
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:38,999
checks them all at the same time.

62
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:44,309
This is what we call quantum parallelism
and it's what allows quantum algorithms

63
00:03:44,369 --> 00:03:49,019
to dramatically reduce decision latency
for time sensitive financial transaction.

64
00:03:49,574 --> 00:03:54,374
The second principle is entanglement
instance, famously called it

65
00:03:54,644 --> 00:03:56,564
spooky actions at a distance.

66
00:03:56,834 --> 00:04:00,194
When two qubits are entangled,
their fades are linked.

67
00:04:00,554 --> 00:04:05,144
If you measure one, you instantly
know the state of the other no

68
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,974
matter how far apart they are.

69
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:10,034
For finance, this is a revolutionary.

70
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,254
It means we can use entangle.

71
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:16,684
Across vast financial data
sets without having to manually

72
00:04:16,684 --> 00:04:18,664
sift through every data point.

73
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:23,164
These principles allow quantum computers
to solve certain types of problems,

74
00:04:23,284 --> 00:04:28,444
specifically optimization, simulation,
and complex sampling exponentially

75
00:04:28,444 --> 00:04:31,085
faster than any classical computer ever.

76
00:04:31,085 --> 00:04:31,294
Code.

77
00:04:31,794 --> 00:04:37,164
Now it's crucial to understand that we are
not talking about replacing our existing

78
00:04:37,164 --> 00:04:38,964
data center with quantum computer.

79
00:04:39,324 --> 00:04:42,894
The future, at least for the
foreseeable feature, is hybrid.

80
00:04:43,194 --> 00:04:48,614
We'll use a combination of classical and
quantum system each playing its strengths.

81
00:04:49,114 --> 00:04:50,769
This slide shows a high level of.

82
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:54,119
What the quantum enhanced
streaming architecture looks like.

83
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:58,019
At the bottom, we have our
classical infrastructure.

84
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:01,259
This is your high performance
compute, your network fabric,

85
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,119
your existing databases.

86
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,809
This workhorse layer
handles the 99% of task.

87
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:12,329
It's already good at data storage, basic
processing, and moving data around.

88
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:16,719
Next we have the real time
processing stream processing layer.

89
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:21,069
Using technologies like Apache,
Flink and Kafka, this is where

90
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:22,239
the real time processing happens.

91
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,089
This is a circulatory
system we talked about.

92
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:29,709
We're developing quantum aware
connectors that know when to route

93
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:34,149
a specific computationally intensive
task away from the classical part.

94
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:39,204
This data then feeds our features
storage there, built on platform

95
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:41,204
like Feast or a w SageMaker.

96
00:05:41,754 --> 00:05:47,574
This layer is quantum optimized, meaning
it can store and serve a feature that are

97
00:05:47,574 --> 00:05:52,914
either generated by quantum processes or
designed to be consumed by one, and at

98
00:05:52,914 --> 00:05:58,044
the top, the pinnacle of the architecture
are the quantum processor processing unit.

99
00:05:58,109 --> 00:06:00,139
These are specialized accelerator.

100
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,779
We don't send every transaction to QPU.

101
00:06:03,534 --> 00:06:07,284
We send it the hardest problem,
the complex calculations and

102
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,934
pattern recognition task that
would choke a classical system.

103
00:06:11,174 --> 00:06:16,334
In this model, the classical system
enables a workflow while the QPU acts

104
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:21,044
as a powerful co-processor tackling
the in intractable parts of the

105
00:06:21,044 --> 00:06:24,434
problem before feeding the answer
back into the classical stream.

106
00:06:24,674 --> 00:06:28,724
This is the pragmatic
path to quantum advantage.

107
00:06:29,224 --> 00:06:30,689
Let us look into the use case.

108
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:30,989
One.

109
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:32,189
Quantum powered Trading.

110
00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:33,119
Trading strategies.

111
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:35,859
Let's make this tangible.

112
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,699
How does this architecture apply to the
demanding world of algorithmic trading?

113
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:44,709
The goal in trading is to find a
true signal in a sea of noise and to

114
00:06:44,714 --> 00:06:46,629
act on it faster than anyone else.

115
00:06:46,929 --> 00:06:51,909
Quantum gives us an on both front
signal processing market data

116
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:53,829
is incredibly noisy Quantum.

117
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:55,679
Signal processing.

118
00:06:56,159 --> 00:07:02,719
Leveraging principle from quantum sensing
can filter this noise and identify faint

119
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:05,759
patterns with incredible precision.

120
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:09,239
Often in nanoseconds, this
means getting a cleaner, more

121
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:10,629
accurate picture of the, market.

122
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:12,369
Faster pattern recognition.

123
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:16,284
Many trading strategies
rely on identifying complex.

124
00:07:17,184 --> 00:07:19,494
Multidimensional pattern
and market behavior.

125
00:07:19,644 --> 00:07:23,514
Quantum mission learning algorithm
can perform this pattern recognition

126
00:07:23,994 --> 00:07:27,834
up to a hundred times faster than
classical methods, allowing to

127
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:31,614
identify and act on opportunities
that would otherwise be missed.

128
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:36,824
Simultaneously, scenarios, perhaps
most powerfully used powerfully using

129
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:41,684
super position, a quantum algorithm
can over thousand potential rating

130
00:07:41,684 --> 00:07:44,474
scenarios simultaneously per microsecond.

131
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:45,254
This.

132
00:07:45,684 --> 00:07:49,434
Includes modeling market
impact, running risk checks, and

133
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:51,714
optimizing execution strategy.

134
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:56,304
All concurrently, it represents a
monumental leap from the sequential

135
00:07:56,394 --> 00:07:58,764
analysis of a classical system.

136
00:07:59,264 --> 00:08:02,834
Next comes the ultra low
latency fraud detection.

137
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:04,874
Another critical area is fraud detection.

138
00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:07,184
Every microsecond counts.

139
00:08:07,514 --> 00:08:10,904
The goal is not just to detect
fraud, but to intervene.

140
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:15,749
Before the transaction is finalized and
the money is gone, anomaly detection.

141
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:20,009
Sophisticated fraud often involves
subtle deviation from normal

142
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:22,169
patterns spread across many accounts.

143
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:22,889
And transaction.

144
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:28,149
Quantum algorithms are uniquely suited
to spotting this microscopic pattern

145
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:31,179
deviation with sub microsecond position.

146
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:32,739
The feature extraction.

147
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:36,159
A key part of modern fraud detection
is analyzing the relationship.

148
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,569
Our quantum optimized feature stores
can deliver incredibly complex.

149
00:08:41,069 --> 00:08:45,119
Like the correlation between a
group of new accounts making similar

150
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:48,839
transaction in picosecond, look
at the time it is in picosecond.

151
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:52,859
This is speed at a level,
classical system can't match

152
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:54,839
risk assessment and intervention.

153
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:59,369
Quantum parallelism allows us to
evaluate millions of risk vector

154
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:01,919
simultaneously for single transaction.

155
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:07,889
An instant highly accurate risk score,
which in turn enables ultra low latency

156
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:12,119
response capabilities to neutralize
fraudulent transaction before completion.

157
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:15,419
This is the difference between
foreign analysis after the

158
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:17,789
fact and a realtime prevention.

159
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:22,039
Finally, let's look at an application
focused on the end customer.

160
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:23,339
Personalized.

161
00:09:23,344 --> 00:09:28,564
The dream has always been to provide truly
individual holistic advice that adapts in

162
00:09:28,564 --> 00:09:31,624
real time quantum customer segmentation.

163
00:09:31,684 --> 00:09:36,454
Today's segmentation is often
based on broad demographic data,

164
00:09:36,724 --> 00:09:38,134
quantum clustering algorithm.

165
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:40,804
We can process billions
of behavioral data points.

166
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:45,144
Inquiries life events to create
hyper personalized client segment.

167
00:09:45,504 --> 00:09:48,414
A grouping customer by
subtle shared behavior needs.

168
00:09:48,744 --> 00:09:53,604
Quantum neural networks two
mo model the complex, often

169
00:09:54,534 --> 00:09:56,244
financial behavior of individuals.

170
00:09:56,544 --> 00:09:58,134
We can use quantum neural network.

171
00:09:58,224 --> 00:10:02,179
These models can handle exponentially
more parameters than their classical

172
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:06,624
counterparts, allowing for a much
richer and more accurate understanding

173
00:10:06,624 --> 00:10:08,674
of classical client needs.

174
00:10:09,364 --> 00:10:11,134
Dynamic portfolio optimization.

175
00:10:11,134 --> 00:10:15,324
This is a classic opt classic optimization
problem and a perfect fit for quantum.

176
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:19,944
A quantum system can continuously
recalculate optimal asset allocation for

177
00:10:19,944 --> 00:10:24,774
millions of clients as market condition
and correlations shift in real time.

178
00:10:25,014 --> 00:10:28,519
This is not a nightly reval,
it's a living adaptive p.

179
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:32,319
Personalized recommendation within
microseconds of market events,

180
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:37,130
imagine a client's portfolio being
automatically adjusted to mitigate risk.

181
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,149
The instant relevant geopolitical.

182
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:42,669
This is the future of financial advice.

183
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:45,029
Now it's essential to be realistic.

184
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,299
This incredible power comes with equally
incredible engineering challenges.

185
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,055
This is not easy.

186
00:10:53,054 --> 00:10:56,414
First, the quantum environment
requirements are extreme.

187
00:10:56,685 --> 00:10:57,734
Qubits are fragile.

188
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:03,254
They must be kept in highly isolated
environment at cryogenic temperature,

189
00:11:03,404 --> 00:11:08,384
older than deep space, offered below
20 milli to maintain their quantum

190
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:12,284
state, a property called coherence
that is significant data, trans

191
00:11:12,644 --> 00:11:15,674
translation, moving information from.

192
00:11:16,174 --> 00:11:19,294
Latency costs that must
be meticulously optimized.

193
00:11:19,474 --> 00:11:23,134
Error correction is arguably the
biggest hurdle because qubits are

194
00:11:23,134 --> 00:11:25,054
so fragile, they're prone to error.

195
00:11:25,324 --> 00:11:30,514
We must implement complex, full tolerant
quantum error correction code to preserve

196
00:11:30,514 --> 00:11:32,374
the integrity of our calculation.

197
00:11:32,434 --> 00:11:37,514
And finally, there is immerse
integration complexity in architecting.

198
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:42,639
Seamless high performance
interfaces between quantum, a

199
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:44,859
processor and classical system.

200
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:48,209
This leads to the critical
issue of data quality.

201
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:51,779
Garbage in garbage out is even
more true for quantum system.

202
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:56,344
We need advanced quantum noise
mitigation filters to eliminate signals

203
00:11:56,344 --> 00:11:58,349
interfaced at the quantum level.

204
00:11:59,024 --> 00:12:03,374
We need continuous calibration system
to maintain perfect data synchronization

205
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:07,924
between the quantum and classical
worlds with monitoring protocols that

206
00:12:07,924 --> 00:12:10,384
ensure uncompromised data integrity.

207
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:15,784
And we need fault tolerant design using
techniques like multilayered circuited,

208
00:12:15,784 --> 00:12:20,404
ancy to validate mission critical
finance and financial transaction

209
00:12:20,404 --> 00:12:22,744
with near perfect reliability.

210
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:23,904
Architecting for the future.

211
00:12:23,904 --> 00:12:29,124
The quantum optimized feature store facing
these challenges does not mean we stop.

212
00:12:29,274 --> 00:12:31,014
It means we architect smarter.

213
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:36,114
This slide shows how we are
already re-imagining core

214
00:12:36,114 --> 00:12:37,914
components like the feature store.

215
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,174
For this hybrid feature.

216
00:12:39,234 --> 00:12:41,004
We are optimizing it at every level.

217
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:46,854
Quantum feature of competition, the most
complex feature and financial indicators.

218
00:12:47,274 --> 00:12:52,944
Like derivatives, pricing and or complex
risk metrics are calculate, calculated

219
00:12:52,944 --> 00:12:58,374
using quantum algorithms at unprecedented
speed feature transport optimization.

220
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:03,094
We use quantum inspired routing algorithm
to minimize latency in delivering

221
00:13:03,094 --> 00:13:08,624
these features to the models that need
them, ensuring critical C strategy C.

222
00:13:09,124 --> 00:13:13,534
The optimal placement of features in
the cache dynamically adjusting based

223
00:13:13,534 --> 00:13:18,474
on realtime usage, pattern on demand
feature generation for rarely used,

224
00:13:18,474 --> 00:13:20,784
but computationally heavy features.

225
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:25,464
We just in time computation, balancing
storage cost with performance need

226
00:13:25,824 --> 00:13:30,234
by re-architecting our system with
this principle in mind today, we

227
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:34,644
will, the foundation, need to plug
in quantum processor as they mature.

228
00:13:35,144 --> 00:13:37,754
Quantum feature of financial technology.

229
00:13:37,754 --> 00:13:43,114
So what does the roadmap of
this quantum feature looks like?

230
00:13:43,384 --> 00:13:44,074
Right now?

231
00:13:44,254 --> 00:13:47,014
We are in the era of
early quantum advantage.

232
00:13:47,164 --> 00:13:52,174
Specialized quantum algorithms are being
used to enhance every specific financial

233
00:13:52,174 --> 00:13:57,484
task, demonstrating a clear alphabet,
narrow advantage over classical method.

234
00:13:57,664 --> 00:14:00,724
In the next two, three years, we
will see hybrid system mature.

235
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:06,229
Integrating quantum, classical platform
will become more common capable of

236
00:14:06,229 --> 00:14:10,979
handling complete financial workflows
for specific use cases like portfolio

237
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:13,254
optimization or fraud analysis.

238
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:17,474
Look out for five or more
years, we anticipate the rise

239
00:14:17,474 --> 00:14:19,244
of quantum financial network.

240
00:14:19,544 --> 00:14:24,194
This will be distributed quantum system,
possibly linked by quantum communication

241
00:14:24,194 --> 00:14:28,064
channels that begin to transform the
global financial infrastructure itself.

242
00:14:28,394 --> 00:14:34,034
And in 10 or more years, we can envision
the emergence of quantum native finance.

243
00:14:34,394 --> 00:14:38,504
These will be entirely
new financial markets.

244
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:39,154
Of.

245
00:14:39,654 --> 00:14:43,524
Quantum computing with real-time data
technologies, not science fiction.

246
00:14:43,794 --> 00:14:46,824
It is a next logical step
in the evolution of finance.

247
00:14:47,244 --> 00:14:51,504
Quantum is not a magic bullet that
will replace all classical computing.

248
00:14:51,744 --> 00:14:56,884
It is a highly specialized tool for
new class of computational problems.

249
00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:57,814
The problems of.

250
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:02,444
And complexity that are defining
the future of in our industry.

251
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:06,644
The journey of quantum advantage
is a marathon, not a sprint, and it

252
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:08,864
is fundamentally a hybrid journey.

253
00:15:08,924 --> 00:15:13,184
The financial institution that will lead
in the next decade are the ones that

254
00:15:13,394 --> 00:15:18,344
start preparing now by architecting for
this hybrid reality, investing in the

255
00:15:18,344 --> 00:15:21,164
right skill and beginning to identify.

256
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:25,324
The specific high value problems
where Quantum can deliver a

257
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:26,914
true transformative advantage.

258
00:15:27,154 --> 00:15:30,964
The future of finance will be
faster, smarter, and more secure,

259
00:15:31,024 --> 00:15:33,454
and it'll be in part quantum.

260
00:15:33,604 --> 00:15:35,614
Thank you very much for
your time and attention.

261
00:15:35,884 --> 00:15:40,354
I would be hap happy to answer
any question you may have.
