00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,140
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,790
This is Roja Perman.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,920
I'm currently working as director of
professional services in a population

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,050
health management organization.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,630
I've been in the technology industry.

6
00:00:13,245 --> 00:00:18,475
Since past 16 years playing various
roles in areas like business

7
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:23,395
intelligence, product management,
software delivery, and implementations.

8
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:30,385
Today I would like to focus on how
SMS based solution is revolutionizing

9
00:00:30,385 --> 00:00:32,905
healthcare population management industry.

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,510
We will go through some gaps that
current population healthcare

11
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:43,710
management industry has, and how SMS
based solution is designed to bridge

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,000
these gaps through intelligent message
routing and even driven architecture.

13
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,710
This framework we will also learn
today how it enables healthcare

14
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:59,380
organizations to deliver personalized,
clinical relevant con communications

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,160
that improve the outcomes and
value-based care environments.

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,120
So let's deep dive.

17
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,755
The major gaps in healthcare
population management are.

18
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,715
Our treatment plan, adherence gaps.

19
00:01:14,195 --> 00:01:17,915
This is where healthcare organizations
are struggling with low patient

20
00:01:17,915 --> 00:01:20,485
compliance to prescribed care plans.

21
00:01:21,054 --> 00:01:25,105
Targeted digital communications
have shown a significant boost in

22
00:01:25,195 --> 00:01:29,965
adherence and reduction in missed
opportunities for appointments and

23
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:32,365
decrease in hospital readmissions.

24
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:35,880
Next is patient engagement challenges.

25
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,789
Traditional outreach methods often fail
to maintain consistent patient engagement.

26
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,550
Strategic digital communication approaches
have enabled higher satisfaction

27
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,749
scores and also engagement levels
leading to improved care continuity.

28
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,934
Sometimes the medication
compliance deficits are also

29
00:01:55,934 --> 00:01:58,124
a major gaps in this industry.

30
00:01:58,514 --> 00:02:03,404
Non-adherence to medication regimens
represents a critical gap in effective

31
00:02:03,485 --> 00:02:05,105
population health management.

32
00:02:06,244 --> 00:02:10,384
Structured digital check-ins and
personalized protocols have achieved

33
00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:16,005
major improvement in medication compliance
among previously non-adherent patients.

34
00:02:17,025 --> 00:02:21,015
And the last one is about the
social determinants barriers.

35
00:02:21,165 --> 00:02:25,695
Healthcare systems often lack effective
mechanisms to address non-medical

36
00:02:25,695 --> 00:02:28,755
factors affecting healthcare outcomes.

37
00:02:29,144 --> 00:02:33,345
Digital outreach strategies have
shown a significant improvement

38
00:02:33,345 --> 00:02:37,540
in connecting vulnerable patients
with essential community resources

39
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,980
for food, transportation, and
housing needs almost up to 35%.

40
00:02:44,275 --> 00:02:48,355
There are critical gaps in population
health management today that we

41
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:52,615
just discussed, and how patients
struggle with complex treatment

42
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:56,905
protocols leading to poor outcomes
and increased hospitalizations.

43
00:02:57,805 --> 00:03:01,405
The missed appointments, create
discontinuity of care and

44
00:03:01,405 --> 00:03:03,205
prevent timely interventions.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,649
So the SMS based solutions provide
a healthcare specific technical

46
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:14,749
infrastructure which addresses these
gaps through seamless EHR integrations.

47
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:21,084
This is HIPAA compliant system, and it
also utilizes HL seven fire interfaces

48
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:26,230
to enable automated care gap and
identification and clinical data exchange.

49
00:03:26,615 --> 00:03:32,945
Ensuring that there is an alignment in a
member population and healthcare industry.

50
00:03:34,835 --> 00:03:40,084
Let's try to understand why SMS
is an important framework for

51
00:03:40,084 --> 00:03:41,855
healthcare population management.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,630
I. Today, healthcare population
and healthcare organizations face

53
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,340
significant population health challenges,
including inconsistent treatment,

54
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,780
adherence, and high appointment,
no-show rates, which are preventable.

55
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,755
Hospital hospitable readmissions.

56
00:03:58,465 --> 00:04:02,815
But the delay in care gap closure
is what is the biggest challenge?

57
00:04:03,265 --> 00:04:08,784
Traditional outcome methods reach
only 38% of patients within 24

58
00:04:08,784 --> 00:04:12,445
hours, creating critical delays
in time sensitive interventions.

59
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,000
Population health management faces some
other critical gaps like how we just

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,620
understood, which are communication
delays, fragmented care coordination,

61
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,120
inconsistent patient engagement, and
limited monitoring between visits.

62
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,770
An effective self SMS platform
will address these challenges

63
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,720
through specialized architecture.

64
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,320
Let's look at how this
architecture on a high level is.

65
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:44,389
The healthcare integration layer,
which is comprises of healthcare and

66
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:47,629
FI hhl seven and fire interfaces.

67
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:51,919
We and also qua and also provides
a quality reporting systems.

68
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:58,070
The next layer comes into a clinical
message processing engine, then

69
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:02,090
protected health information database,
and then healthcare compliance layer.

70
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:09,860
This SMS technology and framework also
helps in addressing chronic disease

71
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,080
management among the population health.

72
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:18,770
Population health management currently
is facing continuous monitoring gaps,

73
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,940
medication adherence, and timely
intervention for diabetes management.

74
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:28,720
If you take, for example, the system of
SMS technology implements, structured

75
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,210
pathways aligned with American diabetes
association guidelines, providing blood

76
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,790
glucose monitoring prompts and adherence.

77
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,550
Support to address these critical care
continuity gaps within the patients.

78
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,940
Let's look into some care
transition management opportunities.

79
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,470
The critical gaps in population
health management include inadequate

80
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,700
discharge support, missed follow up
appointments, medication errors, and

81
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:59,370
insufficient post discharge monitoring,
which is especially affecting

82
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,500
patients with limited health literacy.

83
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:08,230
MS technology is helps with discharge
instruction reinforcement by

84
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:12,700
sequencing the messages following
evidence-based transitional care models.

85
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,400
SMS can also be used to send out
follow-up appointment coordination,

86
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,480
which is like an automated reminders
with preparation instructions.

87
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:29,695
SMS can also be Inc utilized in medication
reconciliation support with structured

88
00:06:29,695 --> 00:06:34,525
check-ins to verify understanding and
adherence of medications by the patients.

89
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:41,800
SMS can also be utilized in post discharge
monitoring, where symptoms assessment with

90
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,480
a alert threshold, sending out alerts of
what kind of sub symptoms that a patients

91
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:53,590
are encountering and what should be the
next steps can be monitored and sent out.

92
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,540
The alerts can be sent out with the SMS.

93
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,910
Thus, SMS can also be can play a major
role in preventative care and screening.

94
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:07,550
Let's understand some of the
popular ways and significant areas.

95
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,010
The significant gaps exist in population
healthcare and delivery, which is creating

96
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,685
opportunities for systematic improvement
through structural interventions.

97
00:07:18,215 --> 00:07:21,915
One of the such areas is low
screening completion rates.

98
00:07:22,365 --> 00:07:25,875
Traditional reminder systems
fail to account for individual

99
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:30,285
risk factors resulting in missed
cancer detection opportunities and

100
00:07:30,285 --> 00:07:33,015
preventable late stage diagnosis.

101
00:07:34,485 --> 00:07:39,735
Conventional immunization outreach methods
achieve inadequate populate co population

102
00:07:39,735 --> 00:07:45,235
coverage, leaving vulnerable groups
suspectable to preventable diseases.

103
00:07:46,135 --> 00:07:51,614
Lack of pre-visit preparation leads
to missed care opportunities with

104
00:07:51,614 --> 00:07:55,575
providers struggling to address
multiple preventative needs

105
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,674
during time constraint encounters.

106
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:02,385
The systematic approach of
SMS-based solution addresses these

107
00:08:02,385 --> 00:08:04,335
gaps to targeted interventions.

108
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:09,985
For example, risk stratified cancer
screening, structured immunization

109
00:08:09,985 --> 00:08:14,065
management, and enhanced wellness
visit coordination In all of

110
00:08:14,065 --> 00:08:20,265
such targeted intervention areas,
SMS can play a major role with.

111
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:27,560
How we can align the proactive outreach
with pre visit guidance and also,

112
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,570
which also increases the care gap.

113
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:36,340
Continuancy, let's look into some more
gaps in population health management

114
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:41,740
where SMS technology has addressed
challenges and and also in social

115
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,760
determinants of health effectively,
which has created opportunities

116
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,680
for technology driven solutions.

117
00:08:48,785 --> 00:08:54,485
Today, major portion, almost up until
75% of healthcare organizations report

118
00:08:54,485 --> 00:08:59,465
significant barriers in coordinating care
across multiple providers and community

119
00:08:59,465 --> 00:09:04,445
resources, resulting in duplicate efforts
and missed intervention opportunities.

120
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:10,920
There are access disparities where
vulnerable populations face higher

121
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,450
barriers to accessing preventative
services with transportation limitations

122
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,950
and inflexible appointment systems,
which are disproportionately affecting

123
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,040
rural and low income communities.

124
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:28,760
Communication breakdowns, traditional
communication channels reach only up to.

125
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,360
62% of high risk patients today with
one way messaging, failing to provide

126
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,310
actionable insights into patient
circumstances between clinical encounters.

127
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,439
Clinical decisions are made with
incomplete information and where social

128
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:49,420
determinant factors are impacting
health outcomes remain undocumented

129
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,939
in a traditional EHR systems.

130
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,040
Addressing these gaps requires an
integrated technology approaches

131
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:02,530
and an SMS based technology and
framework is a right way to address

132
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:08,050
these key and gaps and has shown with
significant statistics and improvement.

133
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,735
Let's look at some more healthcare
gaps that SMS technology has addressed.

134
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,949
There are some strategic communication
approaches where the, these gaps have

135
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:21,169
been bridged and let's look at them.

136
00:10:21,739 --> 00:10:23,209
Limited patient engagement.

137
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:27,829
Many patients, particularly those in
underserved communities, does remain

138
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:32,329
disconnected from their care team
between visits, resulting missed

139
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:34,369
opportunities for early intervention.

140
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:37,354
Having that patient or
a member in a rural.

141
00:10:37,584 --> 00:10:42,314
Setting have a continuous
engagement with the patient cares.

142
00:10:42,444 --> 00:10:48,584
The team via an SMS is at least
cost effective yet that which

143
00:10:48,584 --> 00:10:52,545
can bridge these gap that we have
spoken about, the critical gaps.

144
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,614
Inconsistent care protocol adherence.

145
00:10:55,944 --> 00:11:00,505
Without structured communication
systems, care teams actually struggling

146
00:11:00,505 --> 00:11:05,665
to consistently apply evidence-based
protocols across diverse populations.

147
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:12,344
In accessing the access disparities for
the member population, SMS technology

148
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:17,505
has bridged major gaps in barriers for
underserved and rural populations with

149
00:11:17,505 --> 00:11:22,574
limited healthcare access care continuity,
where the structured communication

150
00:11:22,574 --> 00:11:27,045
pathways address fragmentation and
post discharge and chronic condition

151
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:34,115
management that has taken leap and bounds
of improvement and has bridge the gap.

152
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:39,430
Healthcare literacy tailored messaging
frameworks overcome educational

153
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:44,050
and language barriers that impact
health outcomes for implementation

154
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,060
of support and additional resources.

155
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:54,440
These patients can always contact
these care teams of how to improve

156
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:59,820
in their healthcare outcomes and
disparities using SMS technology.

157
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:01,860
Thank you.
