1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,650
All right.

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,140
Thanks for watching my session.

3
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,610
this is culture is still a challenge.

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,370
I am Mandy Walls.

5
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:10,800
I am a developer advocate,
DevOps advocate at PagerDuty.

6
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,859
I'm always happy to chat about stuff.

7
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,129
I'm not going to be talking
about PagerDuty today.

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,619
Always happy to chat if you
want to reach out to me.

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,340
I'm M Walls of PagerDuty.

10
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:19,770
com.

11
00:00:20,205 --> 00:00:24,215
Or, I'm LNXCHK, mostly on Blue Sky.

12
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:26,125
and you can always reach out on LinkedIn.

13
00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:31,514
So, this is a topic that I've been
thinking about for a long time.

14
00:00:31,715 --> 00:00:36,135
I wrote this white paper, Building a
DevOps Culture for O'Reilly in 2012.

15
00:00:36,415 --> 00:00:38,955
So, yeah, we've been
at this a while, right?

16
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:45,325
DevOps being sort of this combination
of tools and people and processes

17
00:00:45,775 --> 00:00:47,815
and how it sometimes gets hung up.

18
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:52,565
And still gets hung up, right, on the
cultural bits because organizational

19
00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:55,105
culture is a challenge, right?

20
00:00:55,115 --> 00:00:55,965
It's hard.

21
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:58,785
It's, it's something that,
it can be different from,

22
00:00:59,335 --> 00:01:00,665
organization to organization.

23
00:01:00,665 --> 00:01:02,055
It's different in different countries.

24
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:04,445
it's different in different
kinds of organizations.

25
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:08,635
so we're going to explore some stuff and
hopefully you'll find it interesting.

26
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:14,825
So the first thing to really get a
grounding on is what is culture, right?

27
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:14,879
Okay.

28
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,760
You think about, if you ask your
friends, like, about the companies

29
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,780
that they work for, right?

30
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,650
What's the culture like over there?

31
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:27,130
What kinds of things do you hope to learn
about when you ask that question, right?

32
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,290
What, what is the culture,
what's the cultural mean to you?

33
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,400
about that organization.

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,070
And how folks respond is
going to vary hugely, right?

35
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,450
sometimes it's going to be
like unequivocally positive.

36
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,030
It's great.

37
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,590
We have A, B, and C.

38
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,330
maybe they mention things like
the PTO policy or the benefits

39
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,100
or the opportunities for learning
and all that great stuff.

40
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,160
Sometimes the answer will be negative.

41
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,620
The hours are long, the projects are
poorly run, the customers want too much,

42
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,960
and the sales team is over promised.

43
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,340
There were no raises, you
know, things like that.

44
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:06,110
And, those are obviously things that are,
are negative and reflect into not only the

45
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,460
organization itself, the value, the things
that your employee friend kind of values.

46
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,680
Sometimes you get these answers like, it
depends, it depends on the department.

47
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,640
It might depend on the
absolute team manager.

48
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,570
Some people might have amazing, wonderful
experiences working for the company,

49
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,700
while others find it absolutely.

50
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,690
demoralizing, right?

51
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:32,390
So the central organizational culture is
so weak or so unsupported that doesn't

52
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,330
reach every team in the company, right?

53
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,780
Often that is because of weak
leadership or overburdened leadership,

54
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,210
just the size of the organization.

55
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,529
We're in an era where some of the
organizations we work for are some of

56
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,210
the biggest that have ever existed.

57
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,470
And there's a limit to how much
people can really keep track of.

58
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,990
And that applies to our executive
leadership as well as You know,

59
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,300
a line manager that has 20
to 30 direct reports, right?

60
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,520
There's just a lot going on.

61
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,470
So things happen and they kind of fall
apart or get frayed around the edges.

62
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:11,080
So culture is felt in what the
organization rewards, what behaviors it

63
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,070
tolerates, what things it punishes, right?

64
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,700
How it enforces customs
or agreements, right?

65
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,530
All these things.

66
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:24,660
Over time, the culture becomes In
addition to that, a framework for

67
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,870
how the organization solves problems.

68
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,900
We, as an organization, value innovation.

69
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,450
So we may over, sort of over
optimize for innovation, versus,

70
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,650
you know, taking a harder look at
maybe revitalizing an older project.

71
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,140
Some of these things happen, right?

72
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,490
It forms the basis of the sort of,
What is, but also why is, right?

73
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,220
It becomes a story of the organization,
of the decisions that have been

74
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,020
made, of some of the people that
have been there a long time.

75
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,300
Like, why is that person still here?

76
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,700
Like, there might be a story there, right?

77
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,580
so when DevOps first emerged, and we're
talking about, what, 15 years ago now?

78
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:06,070
it was in response to dysfunctional
culture and technical organizations.

79
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:12,915
Dev versus Ops, combined with this,
like, pathological disdain for users

80
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:16,025
because what are they doing other
than messing things up for us, right?

81
00:04:16,675 --> 00:04:21,745
DevOps really tried to show a better
way, but it hasn't, I'll say it

82
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:23,435
hasn't panned out for everyone, right?

83
00:04:23,905 --> 00:04:28,425
so folks make changes around the
things they have influence on.

84
00:04:28,945 --> 00:04:32,405
And if you're on a technical
team, that ends up largely being

85
00:04:32,425 --> 00:04:34,025
things like tooling, right?

86
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:41,785
And so unfortunately, Some of those teams
are still struggling to make time for all

87
00:04:41,785 --> 00:04:43,855
the other stuff that has to go into it.

88
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:46,735
So, the culture is really
to be human, right?

89
00:04:46,735 --> 00:04:47,505
It's how we are.

90
00:04:47,505 --> 00:04:48,755
We are a social species.

91
00:04:49,185 --> 00:04:54,194
And as humans join together, they
create norms and patterns and

92
00:04:54,195 --> 00:04:58,145
relationships and this sort of
scaffolding for how things work together.

93
00:04:58,155 --> 00:04:58,704
And that is the culture.

94
00:04:59,335 --> 00:04:59,845
Culture.

95
00:04:59,935 --> 00:05:00,295
Right.

96
00:05:00,535 --> 00:05:03,925
The hard part about actually
investigating it is you don't always

97
00:05:03,925 --> 00:05:06,025
understand like where, where it is.

98
00:05:06,295 --> 00:05:08,995
That's the joke with the, the
fish in the fish bowl, right?

99
00:05:09,495 --> 00:05:12,015
An older fish swimming
by two younger fish.

100
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,865
He says, morning boys, how's the water?

101
00:05:14,865 --> 00:05:17,535
And the younger fish are
like, the hell is water.

102
00:05:17,895 --> 00:05:20,355
You don't even realize
you're in a culture, right?

103
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:24,405
It becomes so ingrained and just
the way things are that it's hard to

104
00:05:24,405 --> 00:05:27,015
like disarticulate, which pieces are.

105
00:05:27,755 --> 00:05:30,475
cultural pieces and where
did that culture come from?

106
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:31,475
Is it organizational?

107
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:32,685
Is it national?

108
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:36,055
Is it something that is, you
know, regional to the place

109
00:05:36,065 --> 00:05:37,435
where you're actually located?

110
00:05:37,765 --> 00:05:40,554
And, and some of those things
can be, super hard to deal with.

111
00:05:40,744 --> 00:05:44,614
But, the good part is, it's
been around for a while, right?

112
00:05:44,874 --> 00:05:50,215
So, going back, and not just back
15 years to the beginning of DevOps,

113
00:05:50,215 --> 00:05:53,085
let's go back to the Hundred Years War.

114
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:57,725
And this is 13th century
France, all right?

115
00:05:58,045 --> 00:06:03,165
And I will admit that because
I am an American and had, U.

116
00:06:03,165 --> 00:06:03,315
S.

117
00:06:03,315 --> 00:06:07,465
high school history, did not learn
anything really about European

118
00:06:07,465 --> 00:06:12,655
history after the fall of Rome until
1492, because obviously the most

119
00:06:12,655 --> 00:06:17,775
important thing the Europeans ever
did was send ships to the New World.

120
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:18,765
Right?

121
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,675
Because why would you care
about what happened in between?

122
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:24,285
so, the Battle of Crecy was
part of the Hundred Years War.

123
00:06:24,535 --> 00:06:28,665
I first heard of it on an episode
of Midsummer Murders, if you're

124
00:06:28,665 --> 00:06:31,115
familiar with that TV show in the UK.

125
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:35,745
and it was all about the, the descendants
of people who had fought in the battle.

126
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:37,045
But we'll get there.

127
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:42,274
So, the Battle of Crecy, was
related to the secession of England.

128
00:06:42,774 --> 00:06:43,674
the kingdom of France.

129
00:06:43,824 --> 00:06:50,424
So the French king died, he didn't have
any sons or nephews from his brothers.

130
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:53,614
He had a nephew from his sister
who happened to be the king

131
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:55,244
of England at the time, right?

132
00:06:55,524 --> 00:07:00,094
And England In the 13th century is
kind of the poor relations, of France.

133
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:05,784
and then you've got the, his cousins,
the dead king's cousins in France,

134
00:07:06,484 --> 00:07:11,314
a whole bunch of them, plus a number
of other, like, dukes and rulers, and

135
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:14,254
for some reason the king of Bohemia
was there because he was bored.

136
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:15,954
You know, it's just kind of crazy.

137
00:07:16,454 --> 00:07:20,934
But, so the English arrive
in northern France, right?

138
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:23,634
They cross the Channel, They land
in northern France, and they're

139
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:24,814
just kind of marching through.

140
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:26,764
They know there's going to be a
battle at some point, it's not like

141
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:28,114
these things are planned, right?

142
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:32,174
It's just kind of like when the armies
merge, there's going to be a fight.

143
00:07:32,654 --> 00:07:37,214
And they're burning and pillaging along
the way, but they come upon Crecy.

144
00:07:37,254 --> 00:07:42,874
And you can see from the picture, there's
this hill in this, in this area, and they

145
00:07:42,974 --> 00:07:44,904
take this up as their defensive position.

146
00:07:44,914 --> 00:07:48,784
They know they're not far
from the amassed French army.

147
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:53,244
And they found this defensive
position, just happens to be here,

148
00:07:53,554 --> 00:07:56,284
and they're like, this is where
we're going to pitch our battle.

149
00:07:56,474 --> 00:07:57,944
This looks like a good place to do it.

150
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:03,544
So, they put up their defensive
positions, they've got, you know, some

151
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:09,784
siege engines of some sort, but like
also, cavalry and their secret weapon.

152
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:13,994
Which, funnily enough, their
secret weapon is the Welsh.

153
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,794
So, you can see from the
picture there in the foreground,

154
00:08:18,294 --> 00:08:20,614
are, dudes with bows, right?

155
00:08:20,754 --> 00:08:22,004
Not just any bow.

156
00:08:22,264 --> 00:08:23,714
This is the Welsh Longbow.

157
00:08:24,044 --> 00:08:27,114
The Welsh Longbow is about two
meters tall, it's about six feet,

158
00:08:27,434 --> 00:08:31,364
and it takes like 85 foot pounds
of pressure to pull the thing.

159
00:08:31,384 --> 00:08:33,994
It really, really requires
a lot of strength.

160
00:08:34,494 --> 00:08:37,974
Out of that weapon, though,
The projectiles are amazing.

161
00:08:38,274 --> 00:08:43,534
legendary, archer could, shoot a man on
horseback, go through his leg, through,

162
00:08:43,694 --> 00:08:45,774
through his saddle, kill his horse, right?

163
00:08:45,784 --> 00:08:47,544
That's how powerful these things were.

164
00:08:48,044 --> 00:08:52,574
The French did not know about the
Welsh Longbow when they marched

165
00:08:52,604 --> 00:08:54,694
into the field to start this battle.

166
00:08:55,094 --> 00:08:56,514
They arrive sort of midday.

167
00:08:56,774 --> 00:09:00,294
The English are expecting them to be
like, Ah, we'll start the battle tomorrow.

168
00:09:00,294 --> 00:09:01,384
It's gonna be dark soon.

169
00:09:01,384 --> 00:09:02,984
You know, you know, it's too late.

170
00:09:03,384 --> 00:09:06,424
We'll start the battle in the morning
when everybody's fresh and had breakfast.

171
00:09:06,734 --> 00:09:09,064
The French are like, No,
we're doing this now.

172
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:11,004
And they just start
marching onto the field.

173
00:09:11,004 --> 00:09:16,694
Um, the Welsh just start pulling
arrows after arrow after arrow.

174
00:09:17,094 --> 00:09:22,265
And, A well trained longbowman
can fire like a dozen or more

175
00:09:22,265 --> 00:09:23,525
of these things a minute, right?

176
00:09:23,525 --> 00:09:25,615
They're just like going straight at it.

177
00:09:25,615 --> 00:09:26,835
It's amazing, right?

178
00:09:27,335 --> 00:09:30,905
And they're just plowing
through the French and the

179
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:32,405
French have no idea what to do.

180
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,095
There's some walkie talkies.

181
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,545
They've got all these like weird leaders.

182
00:09:36,545 --> 00:09:40,985
They're not really allies
of a permanent sort.

183
00:09:40,995 --> 00:09:46,075
They're kind of like temporary alliances
while this battle is being fought

184
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,915
against the English and then they're
going to fight against themselves

185
00:09:49,145 --> 00:09:51,035
later anyway to figure all things out.

186
00:09:51,605 --> 00:09:55,755
So, they're not really an army
the way we think of it, right?

187
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:59,275
There's no one person definitely
in charge of absolutely everything.

188
00:09:59,685 --> 00:10:06,340
There's Philip, who is sort of the
presumptive heir, and he's marginally

189
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,940
in charge, but he's not in the front.

190
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:13,169
So some of his cousins, some of these
other folks, are out in the front, and

191
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:19,260
the French culture at the time, much
like we find other sort of medieval sort

192
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,250
of cultures that, you know, you kind
of think about in sort of an infectual

193
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,960
term, is to die in battle is to die
with honor, and they just go for it.

194
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,330
And they are mowed down
like they are grass.

195
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,970
And Phillip's like, Well,
we should probably retreat.

196
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,000
There's no way to do that.

197
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,339
They don't want to do that anyhow, because
to die in battle is to die with honor.

198
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,629
So, in the end, of
course, the French lose.

199
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:44,259
Right?

200
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,120
They had not expected to lose.

201
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:52,020
They outnumbered the English somewhere
between 7, 000 and 15, 000 militants.

202
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,060
No one really knows how many folks were
there because some of them are just like

203
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,180
farmers who were out for a jaunt and
it was like it was August so it's kind

204
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,380
of slow time on the farm or whatever.

205
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,359
The French had amassed an army of like
20 to 30, 000 men, right, and they

206
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,770
were just decimated during this battle.

207
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,890
They had nowhere to go
with their assumptions.

208
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:19,260
They assumed they were going to
go on to this field of battle and

209
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,970
it would be hand to hand melee.

210
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,420
Because that's what they were doing.

211
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,250
That's what had been the path of
battle for, hundreds of years, right?

212
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,250
Because the French and English have
always been at each other's throats.

213
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,950
Instead, no.

214
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,230
Whole new paradigm.

215
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,530
Whole new paradigm.

216
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:40,530
Changed the format, changed the face
of war in Europe until the introduction

217
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,180
of gunpowder like 150 years later.

218
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,320
These longbows.

219
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,430
So, changed all assumptions.

220
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:53,300
about how you were going to approach the
problem of going into battle with English.

221
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,810
But the French had no prior experience or
prior scaffolding to make new decisions

222
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,740
based on the change of circumstances
when they were met with this new weapon.

223
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,080
So there's a whole
other story, about this.

224
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,570
I found it really interesting.

225
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,520
it was in an episode of a podcast.

226
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,390
I will link to it at the end of
the episode, the end of my talk, so

227
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,780
that, you can listen to it as well.

228
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,950
But it's super interesting, right?

229
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,390
But like As you're thinking about
this, you're thinking, Ah, that's

230
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,630
a, that's a 13th century, man.

231
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,390
That's hundreds of years ago.

232
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:29,310
And, at the time, the biggest
organizations on the planet were probably

233
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,710
the Catholic Church and these armies.

234
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,139
And these armies weren't
permanent standing armies.

235
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,719
They were just kind of like, you grabbed
who you could grab, who was available

236
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,599
on some campaign you decided to run.

237
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:44,109
They weren't drilled armies.

238
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,110
Right?

239
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:49,440
The Longbowmen, the Crossbowmen, the
Cavalry, they'd been trained, but most of

240
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,530
them weren't professional soldiers, right?

241
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,830
They were just kind of a ragtag bunch
of folks that got caught up in it.

242
00:12:55,049 --> 00:13:00,660
So, a lot of things about organizations,
organizational behaviors, even go back

243
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,110
as far as, like I say, the 13th century.

244
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,520
So that makes it hard, right?

245
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:10,350
That gives us a place to sort of
hang our expectations of what we can

246
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,329
learn from organizational behaviors.

247
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,860
So We know there's a lot of things
that end up being super difficult

248
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,000
about culture, and you have probably
lived this, especially if you

249
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,430
are sort of mid career, right?

250
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,399
And we know that McKinsey has looked
at this, and McKinsey, interestingly

251
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,815
enough, Like, whatever you think
about McKinsey, they've been in

252
00:13:29,815 --> 00:13:32,105
everybody's business for over 100 years.

253
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,665
Like, they've been studying all
of this stuff for a very long

254
00:13:34,665 --> 00:13:37,025
time in the modern era, right?

255
00:13:37,365 --> 00:13:42,294
In the era of the emergence of
large corporate structures, right?

256
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:47,715
So, post industrialization, this
corporatization, all these kinds of

257
00:13:47,715 --> 00:13:49,285
things that come into play, right?

258
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:53,185
And there's a lot of different
research, especially mid century,

259
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:58,140
mid 20th century research on how
Different kinds of organizations

260
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,100
and different kinds of management
styles all relate to this, right?

261
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,410
Because you've got, like,
hierarchical structures that

262
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,950
sort of adopt from military and,
like, all kinds of other things.

263
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,360
So there's been a lot of work on this.

264
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:15,379
So, McKinsey, though, really has
found a lot of sort of interesting

265
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:17,999
data on why culture actually matters.

266
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:19,759
And it's not like we're all
going into battle, right?

267
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:23,679
But culture does correlate
with performance.

268
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,170
60 percent higher returns.

269
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,390
For folks that they've found have
better cultures on whatever their

270
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:35,390
scales they're looking at, 200
percent of the bottom quartile.

271
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,830
Like, there's just a lot of things
that lead into better performance

272
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:45,490
of an organization based on how
the culture operates, right?

273
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:49,669
What you reward, what you punish,
how you establish norms, those

274
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:50,970
kinds of things all play into that.

275
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,410
Culture, very hard to copy.

276
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,370
Products and services.

277
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:57,920
Super easy to copy.

278
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,870
I can sell you the same thing, but I might
not be as successful as you are because

279
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,440
the culture of my organization is poor.

280
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,930
And that relates to, it sort of
trickles down into bad employee

281
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,570
experience, bad customer experience.

282
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,170
All those kinds of things are
downstream of that, right?

283
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,830
McKinsey has found that as well.

284
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,870
Healthy culture facilitates adaptability.

285
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,640
You want to be adaptable.

286
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:28,065
When the battle changes, when the
circumstances change, if your culture says

287
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:32,955
we only value the things we have always
done, it's not going to help you, right?

288
00:15:33,455 --> 00:15:35,785
70 percent of change initiatives fail.

289
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:37,035
That's a big number.

290
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:40,945
70 percent of those are
for cultural reasons.

291
00:15:41,495 --> 00:15:44,005
So, You can do the math.

292
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:48,965
70 percent of 70 percent is
half of all change initiatives

293
00:15:48,975 --> 00:15:51,365
fail because of culture.

294
00:15:51,865 --> 00:15:53,655
You may have lived through this, right?

295
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:57,405
Like, I am sure there are people
watching this now who have absolutely

296
00:15:57,405 --> 00:16:01,885
lived through failed changes, failed
transitions, failed initiatives about

297
00:16:01,885 --> 00:16:07,765
whatever because some piece of the culture
was standing in the way, some value.

298
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,120
that was being strongly held
was in opposition to the

299
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,450
change that needed to be made.

300
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,590
Happens all the time, right?

301
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,870
And then unhealthy culture leads
to underperformance or failure.

302
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,490
Happens often enough, right?

303
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,450
Things just kind of fall apart.

304
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,420
So, culture, top of mind.

305
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,530
It is a topic of discussion and research.

306
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,280
There's dozens of articles
published in business journals.

307
00:16:33,885 --> 00:16:35,595
all the time, right?

308
00:16:35,675 --> 00:16:39,295
About impacts of culture, how to
influence culture, how to change

309
00:16:39,295 --> 00:16:40,475
your organization's culture.

310
00:16:40,975 --> 00:16:43,965
There's no magic quadrant
for culture, right?

311
00:16:44,175 --> 00:16:51,635
It just kind of arises from any and all
of your interpersonal relationships.

312
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:56,195
And it can be influenced by things
like where you grew up, your faith

313
00:16:56,195 --> 00:17:00,069
community, your educational background,
foundational experiences that you've had.

314
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,370
You know, influenced your values
and beliefs, and that all plays a

315
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,000
part in how you fit into a culture,
what you bring to a culture, and how

316
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,650
you're able to influence that culture.

317
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,940
And sometimes in tech, we think
about, you know, organizations that

318
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,040
start out as maybe a monoculture.

319
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:18,550
This is all Silicon Valley
kind of organization.

320
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,220
It's half a dozen white guys
who all went to Stanford.

321
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,550
They're bringing in a limited
number of perspectives and a

322
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,720
limited amount of knowledge about
the world at that point, right?

323
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,030
And that influences the culture
and, and things that are there.

324
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,900
but organizations now sort of know
that, you know, it's kind of important.

325
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,390
That's why all these headlines are here.

326
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,290
They're all taken from the
Harvard Business Review.

327
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,070
I think I have more here.

328
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,660
Yep, this one, this one right
here is from July, August 2024.

329
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,770
The headline is Build a Corporate
Culture That Works, right?

330
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,930
One that isn't broken.

331
00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:00,300
and this one is November, December
2024, so only a few months later.

332
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,850
And this one is We're
Still Lonely at Work.

333
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,130
It's Time for Companies to Take a
Different Approach to Culture, right?

334
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:06,930
They're everywhere.

335
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:10,100
Culture is important to
somebody writing papers.

336
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,565
but the hard part is like, noting that
McKinsey's findings That half of all

337
00:18:16,565 --> 00:18:18,835
transitions fail for cultural reasons.

338
00:18:19,585 --> 00:18:22,005
Recognizing that culture
is hard to change.

339
00:18:22,205 --> 00:18:27,635
Like all these articles that have this
promise to help you build a more learning

340
00:18:27,635 --> 00:18:32,815
culture, or build more curiosity into your
culture, or more resilience, or whatever

341
00:18:32,815 --> 00:18:35,115
the vocabulary word of the day is.

342
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,275
It's going to be hard, right?

343
00:18:37,515 --> 00:18:38,555
It's going to be super difficult.

344
00:18:38,855 --> 00:18:40,845
And there's a good chance
that it's not going to work.

345
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:46,335
So, what are some of the Components
when we're thinking about culture, maybe

346
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:50,245
we're thinking about how this culture
isn't working for our goals, right?

347
00:18:50,265 --> 00:18:56,475
What are the things that we're looking
at that are symbols of the culture?

348
00:18:57,425 --> 00:18:59,795
So, this model is from Edgar Sheen.

349
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,755
There is, I will say, dozens
of models about culture.

350
00:19:03,045 --> 00:19:04,125
You can pick your favorite.

351
00:19:04,555 --> 00:19:06,105
I'm going to talk about
another one in a minute.

352
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,095
This is just an interesting one.

353
00:19:08,305 --> 00:19:12,275
Eggersheen was a,
psychologist and, professor.

354
00:19:12,475 --> 00:19:16,855
He did a lot of the foundational
research in what we now refer to

355
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,655
as organizational behavior, right?

356
00:19:18,665 --> 00:19:23,335
So, again, something that kind of
started middle of the 20th century,

357
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:25,055
really got going in the 80s.

358
00:19:25,065 --> 00:19:30,545
You're thinking about, like, the goal
and, Toyota and all those kinds of things.

359
00:19:30,555 --> 00:19:34,625
All that, Deming kind of era
really started to bring a lot of

360
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:38,735
focus in on this and a lot more,
academic attention, we'll say that.

361
00:19:39,085 --> 00:19:43,675
so Sheen organized
culture into three levels.

362
00:19:44,665 --> 00:19:49,745
Basic assumptions make up the foundation
of your organization's culture.

363
00:19:50,145 --> 00:19:55,325
These get formed over time as team
members work together, how they interpret

364
00:19:55,325 --> 00:20:00,730
behaviors when they're interacting,
things like events and activities, they're

365
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,000
deeply embedded, right, to the point
where they're almost taken for granted.

366
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,930
it's a main part of like the water
in the fishbowl, right, the team

367
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,750
members don't even really recognize.

368
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,560
they're going to be things that have
been in the organization a very long time

369
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,880
that most folks don't consciously notice.

370
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,990
They're just, you know, they're there.

371
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:22,300
A new person might recognize them, right?

372
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,740
And maybe comment on them.

373
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,200
So.

374
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,150
Before I joined PagerDuty, I was at Chef.

375
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:35,070
And if you were a part of the sort of
DevOps movement when Chef was around,

376
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,210
you know, Chef was very sweary, right?

377
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:41,600
Adam, Jacob was very sweary, so we
kind of all took lead from that and

378
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,280
kind of, kind of sweary culture.

379
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,130
PagerDuty not so much, right?

380
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,500
Like, it's kind of different.

381
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:51,195
And as someone who does a lot of public
speaking, you want to, you know, I

382
00:20:51,195 --> 00:20:54,625
want to sort of recognize the culture
of the company that I represent.

383
00:20:54,965 --> 00:20:59,765
And so, you know, I was like, oh,
well, we're, do we swear here?

384
00:20:59,815 --> 00:21:00,255
Am I right?

385
00:21:00,475 --> 00:21:01,455
Can I use a swear word?

386
00:21:01,925 --> 00:21:02,885
I don't know.

387
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:03,615
Maybe.

388
00:21:03,855 --> 00:21:04,475
Might be okay.

389
00:21:04,645 --> 00:21:06,815
But not something that they
had consciously recognized

390
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:08,285
when I asked about it, right?

391
00:21:09,175 --> 00:21:10,665
Because it hadn't really
been part of the culture.

392
00:21:11,165 --> 00:21:14,045
Then you've got values,
that middle layer, right?

393
00:21:14,545 --> 00:21:18,065
These are the things the
company says about itself.

394
00:21:18,885 --> 00:21:20,965
Sometimes mission statements,
things like that, right?

395
00:21:21,275 --> 00:21:22,865
But also public statements that they make.

396
00:21:23,335 --> 00:21:25,115
They're visible things, right?

397
00:21:25,465 --> 00:21:27,855
they might be aspirational in some ways.

398
00:21:28,235 --> 00:21:31,985
These are often the part of the
organization that we unconsciously sort

399
00:21:31,985 --> 00:21:34,195
of associate with the word culture.

400
00:21:34,475 --> 00:21:38,415
things like commitment to diversity,
work life balance, commitment to the

401
00:21:38,415 --> 00:21:42,355
environment, maybe they are B Corp
or triple bottom line kind of place.

402
00:21:42,655 --> 00:21:44,475
Like those things are
all part of their values.

403
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,100
And the most visible layer of culture
sort of floats on the top there.

404
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,010
And these are artifacts
that are produced, right?

405
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,140
A lot of them are easily
recognized by people even outside

406
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,540
of the organization, right?

407
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,960
Like commercials or advertisements, right?

408
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,600
But they're also identifiable to
people within the organization.

409
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,250
Not only because they wrote them,
maybe, but because they're part of the

410
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,050
whole feeling of, of things inside.

411
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,800
these can be your mission statements.

412
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,120
They can be formal procedures.

413
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:20,820
They can even be things like the
Walmart cheer or dress codes, right?

414
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:24,290
every now and then a big corporation
kind of pops up with somebody

415
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,100
rebelling against their dress code.

416
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:29,460
it's part of the cultural
artifacts there, right?

417
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:35,760
When we look at culture more generally,
we often find that, It may be easier

418
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,730
to divide cultural characteristics into
what's visible and invisible, right?

419
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,450
So you might get like a dotted
line in between, sort of down

420
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,460
the middle of that values layer.

421
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,710
it's sort of less of a breakdown than what
Sheen has made in this particular, model.

422
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:57,420
We see the visible characteristics
of local culture, like actual

423
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,480
society culture all around us, right?

424
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,590
You're going to get things like
the arts, history, religion,

425
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,440
all have cultural impacts, the
built environment even, right?

426
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,150
If you're like a fan of 99 percent
Invisible Podcast, like there's a lot of

427
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:17,750
good chunks in there about, oh, well, this
park has benches, but there's armrests

428
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,330
there, so nobody can sleep on them.

429
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,530
Like that's a choice based on
culture prioritization, right?

430
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:30,320
You also get invisible things like
work ethic, decision making, social

431
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,500
rules, gender roles, even kinship.

432
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:37,720
Like some places, have closer
relationships with kin that are sort

433
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,830
of further out in their, family tree.

434
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,060
Like that's all part of, of culture
that things are sort of just are.

435
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,950
They've evolved over time, probably with
reason, but they're just kind of there.

436
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,960
But we do have a place where.

437
00:23:51,565 --> 00:23:56,195
You want to think about occupational
versus organizational culture,

438
00:23:56,195 --> 00:23:57,625
and this is super interesting.

439
00:23:57,905 --> 00:24:02,125
the work that Sheen did with
this, he was looking at chemists.

440
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:06,145
So people with the white powders
and the clear liquids and the

441
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:09,905
mixing and the munching and the
spectrometers and all that great stuff.

442
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:16,805
They sort of find that a particular
occupation, might have its own set of

443
00:24:16,805 --> 00:24:22,275
cultural characteristics independent of
the organization any of those particular

444
00:24:22,275 --> 00:24:24,535
practitioners might belong to, right?

445
00:24:24,845 --> 00:24:30,735
So you've got chemists, they are
doing their work in a lab, right?

446
00:24:31,215 --> 00:24:36,195
And a chemist that works for, say,
Eli Lilly versus Merck versus maybe

447
00:24:36,195 --> 00:24:40,235
Johnson Johnson, they probably
have more in common to each other.

448
00:24:40,715 --> 00:24:46,635
than they do to other folks in other
departments of their organization, right?

449
00:24:46,855 --> 00:24:50,125
And you see this when you maybe
attend conferences, right?

450
00:24:50,585 --> 00:24:58,165
Software engineers, other folks in our,
tech industry have our own sort of norms

451
00:24:58,195 --> 00:25:02,945
and things that we find interesting,
tools that we use that have nothing to

452
00:25:02,945 --> 00:25:05,665
do with anyone else in our organization.

453
00:25:05,675 --> 00:25:09,295
And one of the One of the interesting
pieces about having large organizations

454
00:25:09,295 --> 00:25:14,095
is you get a lot of these, right,
sort of micro, occupational cultures.

455
00:25:14,435 --> 00:25:18,635
so it's, it's another place where
things sort of have like a push pull

456
00:25:18,635 --> 00:25:23,615
relationship, like the organizational
culture versus what I actually identify

457
00:25:23,615 --> 00:25:26,205
with as, say, a software engineer, right?

458
00:25:26,885 --> 00:25:29,125
Because even the folks in this
picture here, right, I have no

459
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:29,965
idea what they're working on.

460
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:33,145
This is a stock photo that we
picked up somewhere, right?

461
00:25:33,715 --> 00:25:37,605
And Even though I have no idea what
they're actually working on, like

462
00:25:37,605 --> 00:25:41,255
that dude on the right, he's got his
laptop and he's got two screens up.

463
00:25:41,595 --> 00:25:45,195
On his rightmost screen,
looks like an IDE, right?

464
00:25:45,195 --> 00:25:49,715
So I can have some idea of how he's
actually doing his work, based on

465
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,185
the tools that he's using, right?

466
00:25:51,185 --> 00:25:56,465
Because I can relate to that, as a, as
another professional in that industry.

467
00:25:56,465 --> 00:26:00,815
And you can get pictures in your mind
of, You know, this sort of generic

468
00:26:00,815 --> 00:26:04,225
software engineer, but you can also
do that with nurses or lawyers or

469
00:26:04,245 --> 00:26:07,865
auto mechanics or the folks that work
in your finance department, right?

470
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:11,575
They kind of have this idea
of how they do their work and

471
00:26:11,575 --> 00:26:12,885
what they sort of relate to.

472
00:26:13,235 --> 00:26:17,365
And I think this is part of where sort
of DevOps has gotten hung up, right?

473
00:26:17,905 --> 00:26:21,425
we've been trying to change
sort of occupational cultures

474
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:25,735
in a way that not everyone's
been maybe on board with, right?

475
00:26:25,735 --> 00:26:25,795
Right.

476
00:26:26,175 --> 00:26:30,535
And it takes time, it probably takes
generational shift, like it does

477
00:26:30,535 --> 00:26:32,285
for other things in society, right?

478
00:26:32,285 --> 00:26:38,035
You want to change the cultural norms
around how women are treated, or how,

479
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,315
homosexuals are treated, or anything else.

480
00:26:40,545 --> 00:26:43,165
Like, it takes generational change.

481
00:26:43,675 --> 00:26:49,045
and if you think about what a software
engineer might have expected to be

482
00:26:49,045 --> 00:26:54,035
doing as their job in, say, the late
1980s, versus what it looks like now.

483
00:26:54,415 --> 00:26:56,565
Things are drastically different, right?

484
00:26:56,875 --> 00:27:01,355
We're no longer putting software on CD
ROMs and putting it in a box and shipping

485
00:27:01,355 --> 00:27:03,545
it to the customer and saying, good luck.

486
00:27:03,885 --> 00:27:07,615
And if you have help, if you need help,
there's this consultant over here that

487
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:11,355
you can pay 1, 000 an hour and they
will help you with this thing because

488
00:27:11,355 --> 00:27:12,765
we're not going to do it, right?

489
00:27:13,035 --> 00:27:16,195
And most of us are no longer
shipping that kind of software.

490
00:27:16,515 --> 00:27:19,485
We're now shipping things that are
available sort of as a service that

491
00:27:19,485 --> 00:27:21,165
changes the relationship, right?

492
00:27:21,405 --> 00:27:27,975
Changes how we interact with our users
because they're no longer at the other

493
00:27:27,975 --> 00:27:31,545
end of a shipped box of software, right?

494
00:27:31,605 --> 00:27:34,365
They're at the other end of
a network connection and it's

495
00:27:34,365 --> 00:27:35,805
much more real time, right?

496
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:43,185
And so that has required a lot of change
across the industry for, especially for

497
00:27:43,185 --> 00:27:44,715
us folks who've been here for a while.

498
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:49,405
And hopefully we start to see with
newer generations and younger folks

499
00:27:49,485 --> 00:27:52,935
joining the industry that things are
just done this way because it's the way

500
00:27:52,935 --> 00:27:55,115
we've always, we now do them, right?

501
00:27:55,385 --> 00:27:59,745
We now have SRE teams and we have dev
and ops sort of working together to

502
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:03,995
make better products for our users
because it's just, that's just the

503
00:28:03,995 --> 00:28:05,825
way we've always done it, right?

504
00:28:06,265 --> 00:28:10,455
So, the occupational culture
is super interesting and as

505
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,445
that work sort of continues in
academia, I hope it will continue.

506
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,865
see a lot more, interesting
things out of that.

507
00:28:16,365 --> 00:28:20,385
Another model that I hope you have
heard of, right, because it comes up

508
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:25,810
quite a lot, I like this one because
It, to me, it feels like, again, show my

509
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:28,390
age, the equalizer on a stereo, right?

510
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:31,820
You can pump the treble up and move the
bass here, and like, there's the mids,

511
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:38,200
and you can kind of structure yourself,
what does your team look like based on,

512
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:42,750
all of these, sort of characteristics
on this Western model as well.

513
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:50,090
it's, and I think this one too is
helpful For folks at many levels in an

514
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:56,170
organization, because it, it, it sort
of refocuses you on your actual team

515
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,120
and the things that your team is doing.

516
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:02,100
And for, especially for individual
contributors, I think there's a lot

517
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:07,160
of pieces here that are approachable
for individual contributors.

518
00:29:07,435 --> 00:29:10,105
Versus needing a lot of
executive buy in for things.

519
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:15,665
So if you haven't looked at the Westrom
model before, it's three basic levels,

520
00:29:15,915 --> 00:29:19,555
or three types, categories of, cultures.

521
00:29:19,585 --> 00:29:25,695
And Westrom pulled this out of research
that was done in, medicine, right?

522
00:29:25,695 --> 00:29:27,465
So again, not in tech, right?

523
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:31,735
She was talking about chemists, this
was talking about healthcare, right?

524
00:29:32,205 --> 00:29:35,225
But thinking about, three
different kinds of cultures, he

525
00:29:35,225 --> 00:29:39,085
breaks them down as pathological,
bureaucratic, and generative.

526
00:29:39,495 --> 00:29:43,895
And pathological seems
psychotic, almost, right?

527
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,785
No cooperation.

528
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:48,825
If you've got, you know, bad
news, like it's your fault that

529
00:29:48,825 --> 00:29:50,255
you brought the bad news to them.

530
00:29:50,905 --> 00:29:52,715
Nobody takes responsibility for anything.

531
00:29:52,955 --> 00:29:56,575
Nobody's allowed to talk to anyone else in
their department until they go up to their

532
00:29:56,575 --> 00:29:59,075
manager, and they talk to their manager,
and they talk to their manager, and then

533
00:29:59,075 --> 00:30:00,715
has to go back down the other side, right?

534
00:30:01,295 --> 00:30:02,345
Very dysfunctional.

535
00:30:02,785 --> 00:30:03,835
Super dysfunctional.

536
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:05,465
bureaucratic.

537
00:30:05,865 --> 00:30:06,905
Rule oriented.

538
00:30:06,915 --> 00:30:08,325
Maybe you've worked a place like this.

539
00:30:08,585 --> 00:30:11,315
Maybe it feels that way because you
work in finance or something like that.

540
00:30:11,315 --> 00:30:13,695
It's kind of like more
rigid than other places.

541
00:30:13,975 --> 00:30:16,555
there's a little bit of
coordination sometimes.

542
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:17,805
A little bit of cooperation.

543
00:30:18,345 --> 00:30:19,855
Messengers are kind of ignored.

544
00:30:20,075 --> 00:30:22,345
It's going to be somebody
else's problem or like some

545
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:24,075
executive has to make a decision.

546
00:30:24,075 --> 00:30:25,565
We're not going to even
think about it right now.

547
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:30,200
You have very narrow, well defined
responsibilities, and you're not really

548
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,110
allowed to get out of that box, right?

549
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,130
You're kind of doing your thing.

550
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,030
Bridging may be tolerated.

551
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,420
You can talk to folks on the other
team in service of important things,

552
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,790
but, like, don't get too close, right?

553
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,770
Don't collaborate.

554
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,500
Like, you could maybe talk to them a bit.

555
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:51,040
Failure leads to justice, and
novelty leads to problems.

556
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:54,865
Like, you know, Thinking about
innovation and change and those

557
00:30:54,865 --> 00:30:56,715
kinds of things is like, smack down.

558
00:30:57,155 --> 00:31:01,455
kind of hints to why 50 percent of change
initiatives fail for cultural reasons.

559
00:31:02,105 --> 00:31:05,915
The last one, generative,
performance oriented, right?

560
00:31:06,735 --> 00:31:07,915
High cooperation.

561
00:31:08,265 --> 00:31:10,665
You don't know what you don't
know, but the person in the next

562
00:31:10,665 --> 00:31:12,285
team might know something, right?

563
00:31:12,545 --> 00:31:16,905
So you want to be able to, Freely
associate with anybody who might

564
00:31:16,915 --> 00:31:19,565
have the information that you
want or need for your project.

565
00:31:20,055 --> 00:31:21,075
Messengers get trained.

566
00:31:21,075 --> 00:31:23,855
How do we find information
that needs to be shared?

567
00:31:23,855 --> 00:31:25,345
How do we appropriately share it?

568
00:31:25,355 --> 00:31:28,555
What is the pathway for
things being, put together?

569
00:31:28,885 --> 00:31:29,835
Risks are shared.

570
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:31,195
Bridging is encouraged.

571
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:32,565
Failure leads to inquiry.

572
00:31:32,585 --> 00:31:34,385
Why did this happen?

573
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,510
This is your, learning
organizations, right?

574
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,940
This is where you've got incident
management comes into play.

575
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,020
We wrote a postmortem.

576
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,060
What did we learn about this thing?

577
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:45,990
And novelty gets implemented.

578
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,250
We want to try it, right?

579
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:51,720
We value culture, or value innovation
in our culture, so we're going

580
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,600
to try some things out, right?

581
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,150
So we're working on it that way.

582
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:59,480
As you read through these, you can
kind of get a picture of, yeah, as

583
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,615
an individual contributor, Like, you
can do some of this stuff without,

584
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:08,265
like, an explicit thing kind of
pounded into your head by a director.

585
00:32:08,505 --> 00:32:10,535
You can talk to people in other teams.

586
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:14,805
You can publish the things that you've
learned during a failure, right?

587
00:32:15,055 --> 00:32:16,695
You can put it on the wiki,
you can talk about it, you

588
00:32:16,695 --> 00:32:17,715
can put it in a Slack channel.

589
00:32:18,015 --> 00:32:22,085
Like, all of these things are really
approachable, so if you haven't read

590
00:32:22,085 --> 00:32:25,825
through the Western, paper, the original
paper is only like five or six pages long,

591
00:32:26,055 --> 00:32:27,905
super good to get a handle on that one.

592
00:32:28,145 --> 00:32:31,875
And just kind of Look at it from
the perspective of, yeah, we want

593
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:35,855
to get to generative, recognizing
that we might be pathological or

594
00:32:35,865 --> 00:32:37,465
bureaucratic about different things.

595
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:41,455
You might already be generative about
some things, but it all helps sort

596
00:32:41,455 --> 00:32:47,135
of move things along and get you to
a place where the culture is working

597
00:32:47,135 --> 00:32:52,285
for you and not against you as your
organization continues to grow.

598
00:32:52,285 --> 00:32:53,730
So.

599
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:57,870
Part of the, the, the issues then
that, that sort of come up, I mentioned

600
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:03,020
as, as part of the occupational
culture, but tech in, in most places

601
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:06,120
is really, it's outcome based, right?

602
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:11,580
culture is judged by a lot of
employees based on how they're

603
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,630
able to deliver on their tasks.

604
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,220
Can they get work done?

605
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,960
It's a simple answer, yes or
no, most of the time, right?

606
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:21,820
Are there arbitrary or
capricious blockages?

607
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,460
Is somebody just sitting in your
way for the hell of it, right?

608
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,700
Like, oh, we've got a change review
board, but it only meets once a quarter.

609
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,290
That's useless, right?

610
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,770
Do goals and priorities
change all the time?

611
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:36,490
You're not really sure what you should
be working on and all these million

612
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,620
different things that come at you.

613
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:44,385
We have a lot of resources and tools to
help us diagnose and Get around some of

614
00:33:44,385 --> 00:33:49,195
those stumbling blocks and impediments
we find in a lot of organizations.

615
00:33:49,575 --> 00:33:52,695
But culture is really a
slow moving ship, right?

616
00:33:52,725 --> 00:33:54,875
Like I said, it might
take generational change.

617
00:33:55,115 --> 00:33:58,555
Some places, right, there might need
to be some turnover in some teams.

618
00:33:59,015 --> 00:34:02,684
you find a lot of folks who identify
with, you know, culture version 1.

619
00:34:02,685 --> 00:34:04,065
0.

620
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:04,940
Right?

621
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,850
That you want to deprecate.

622
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,630
the folks who stand in the
way of sort of every decision.

623
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:10,540
Right?

624
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,740
And sometimes that even means
running outdated versions of

625
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,360
software they can't secure anymore.

626
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,380
Or paying a long term contract
to the vendor because you don't

627
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,690
want to get off of something old.

628
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:24,430
and I often refer back to John
Willis CAMS or CALMS model.

629
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:24,770
Right?

630
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,040
It was originally CAMS and he
added lean to it for CALMS.

631
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:33,250
you can still find this post, on
the Chef blog from 2011, right?

632
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:36,120
What DevOps means to me was
the title of that, right?

633
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:41,000
and when we think about where we want
to get to with DevOps, where we want

634
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:48,410
to get to as practitioners, as members
of organizations, as folks who want to

635
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:53,720
facilitate Improvement, innovation, and
resilience, and all these things that we

636
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,090
talk about from the technical side, right?

637
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:02,150
What needs to come along
with us on the cultural side?

638
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,040
That C in that model is
absolutely the hardest one, right?

639
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:11,230
I often find that teams are good
at the other pieces because it's

640
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,230
based around tooling, right?

641
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:17,020
When we don't know what to do,
we can buy a new tool, right?

642
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,850
If we're stuck, we can maybe
try and buy a new tool.

643
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:24,510
Folks can find themselves a
language or platform to focus

644
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,580
their automation efforts into.

645
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,970
There's lots of that stuff now, right?

646
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:33,090
You can follow recommended practices
for metrics and observability.

647
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,030
And it's changed!

648
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:37,520
Like, things are way different
now than they were in 2011 when

649
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,670
the original post was written.

650
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:39,590
Absolutely.

651
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:42,650
But they are, in many
ways, so much better.

652
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:47,805
And there's so much more variety and
things available that you can make use of.

653
00:35:48,305 --> 00:35:49,345
You can also publish.

654
00:35:49,485 --> 00:35:51,895
Like, sharing is much easier now, right?

655
00:35:52,205 --> 00:35:55,005
Everybody's on some kind
of chat tool all the time.

656
00:35:55,865 --> 00:36:00,955
And it may have been HipChat or, or
whatever in 2011, you know, pour one out.

657
00:36:01,275 --> 00:36:03,064
But, you've probably got a wiki.

658
00:36:03,474 --> 00:36:06,844
You probably have some way
to publicly post something.

659
00:36:06,844 --> 00:36:10,064
You might have an internal engineering
blog where you can share things, right?

660
00:36:10,934 --> 00:36:18,584
We want to get do not repeat yourself from
the micro level in code to the macro level

661
00:36:18,854 --> 00:36:20,604
in the things that we're learning, right?

662
00:36:20,964 --> 00:36:24,834
And that all comes from creating
metrics and sharing things.

663
00:36:25,244 --> 00:36:27,134
And that hopefully comes out, right?

664
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:30,534
You can do posts and reviews, you
can do brown bag discussions, you

665
00:36:30,534 --> 00:36:31,974
can create a community of practice.

666
00:36:32,354 --> 00:36:35,544
Even if it's just like half a
dozen folks in a Slack channel like

667
00:36:35,544 --> 00:36:37,284
sharing posts, they're fine, right?

668
00:36:37,334 --> 00:36:39,054
All that good stuff
comes out of it, right?

669
00:36:39,055 --> 00:36:39,764
Yeah.

670
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:44,324
So that challenge sticks there
in that, let's see, that culture.

671
00:36:44,874 --> 00:36:49,314
Especially for small teams and large
organizations, culture kind of feels

672
00:36:49,314 --> 00:36:52,334
like an impetuous barrier that you're
like banging up against all the time.

673
00:36:52,774 --> 00:36:56,784
and fortunately we can use some of these
description models to help us improve

674
00:36:56,804 --> 00:36:58,514
things at maybe a micro cultural level.

675
00:36:58,664 --> 00:37:00,694
Westrom's model.

676
00:37:01,144 --> 00:37:05,314
To figure out what things we can change
and influence to improve our culture.

677
00:37:05,554 --> 00:37:09,374
We can use some of the things from
Sheen's model to say, Okay, here's

678
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,824
what the organization is telling us.

679
00:37:11,824 --> 00:37:13,034
Here's what it's published.

680
00:37:13,034 --> 00:37:16,544
Here's how that fits or doesn't
fit with what we need to do to

681
00:37:16,544 --> 00:37:18,204
make our, make our goals, right?

682
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:22,384
There's also some additional interesting
things, that have come out in the

683
00:37:22,384 --> 00:37:25,254
last, I think, 10 years, dozen years.

684
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:27,204
one of those is microcultures.

685
00:37:27,514 --> 00:37:33,434
And, this is a place where things are sort
of related to occupational cultures, but

686
00:37:33,474 --> 00:37:35,715
in a more, less organized sort of way.

687
00:37:36,065 --> 00:37:40,725
It's, it's super interesting in, in
a couple of ways in that, some of

688
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:43,645
the early research on microcultures
was actually done on Slashdot.

689
00:37:44,015 --> 00:37:48,045
If you're old enough to have been on
Slashdot in the early days, because

690
00:37:48,045 --> 00:37:54,245
it was a large community distributed,
but completely opt in, right?

691
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:58,710
We think about the things that,
that, Influence us the pieces of

692
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,070
culture that we kind of inherit
as, as we live through our lives.

693
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:07,020
A lot of that stuff is sort of
non opt in, non optional, right?

694
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,210
You live in it, right?

695
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,130
You didn't pick where you were born.

696
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,900
You didn't pick what country
you lived in as a child.

697
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,960
You didn't pick what your
faith community was as a kid.

698
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:19,910
All those things sort of like
built up into your sort of

699
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,800
internal representation of culture.

700
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:27,060
When we get to large online communities,
though, which influence a lot of what

701
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:32,150
we do in technology anyway, I think
Reddit or Y Combinator and other things

702
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:38,050
like that, even online, Twitter or Blue
Sky, whatever, that's all opt in, right?

703
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:42,410
Everyone who's there has sort of chosen
to be there for some reason or another.

704
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:48,880
And that sort of twists the way
the cultural norms kind of happen.

705
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,605
And Right?

706
00:38:49,985 --> 00:38:55,255
They're not necessarily there
because they were part of a social

707
00:38:55,255 --> 00:39:00,485
requirement, or it wasn't because
there were food borne illnesses, right?

708
00:39:00,765 --> 00:39:03,755
The culture around food
consumption can change.

709
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:08,125
Any of those kinds of things might
have been like completely set up in

710
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:11,405
opposition to whatever prevailing culture
might have been there at the time.

711
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:12,505
So, super interesting.

712
00:39:12,775 --> 00:39:14,385
There's a lot more work
being done in microcultures.

713
00:39:15,325 --> 00:39:19,785
but they're narrowly focused, right,
on smaller groups of people organizing

714
00:39:20,665 --> 00:39:23,560
around smaller sets of shared interests.

715
00:39:23,885 --> 00:39:29,905
And, a microculture might be easier to
influence and make improvements on, right?

716
00:39:30,295 --> 00:39:33,365
because you've got, like, maybe,
you've got a microculture maybe on

717
00:39:33,365 --> 00:39:37,705
your team, or, maybe your team and,
like, a handful of other teams that

718
00:39:37,705 --> 00:39:39,835
work on the same sort of platform.

719
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:40,800
Right?

720
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:45,290
If you're an application engineering
team working in Python, maybe

721
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:49,410
you've got another half a dozen
teams that also work in Python.

722
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,400
They're just working on
different kinds of applications.

723
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:55,330
There might be a place there to
influence a microculture around

724
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:59,520
behaviors for how you work on Python
and how you deploy those things.

725
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:05,140
And there's a lot of, you know,
Western model components that

726
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,230
can help you there, right?

727
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:10,800
The, the bridging and cooperation
and all that kind of stuff can all

728
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,960
help improve things along the way.

729
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,410
So, it's a lot of work, right?

730
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:21,290
if you're struggling with how your
organizational culture is impacting

731
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:25,490
you, impacting your job, unfortunately,
most of the time, the easiest thing

732
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,140
to do is to find a new place to work.

733
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:31,350
Because changing microculture
in an organization, super,

734
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,450
super difficult, right?

735
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,540
Because it's probably been that
way a very, very long time.

736
00:40:34,985 --> 00:40:39,775
Or you can work to improve your
microculture and your local team and,

737
00:40:39,825 --> 00:40:41,575
be kind of safe and secure there.

738
00:40:41,585 --> 00:40:43,855
So there's, you know,
there's options, right?

739
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:45,685
Hopefully, for you out there.

740
00:40:45,935 --> 00:40:49,135
so, lots of interesting
things to think about.

741
00:40:49,435 --> 00:40:53,124
lots of reasons why we're
still thinking about them.

742
00:40:53,815 --> 00:40:54,065
Right?

743
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:55,165
15 years on.

744
00:40:55,575 --> 00:40:59,905
And, and why, we're still kind
of getting hung up on stuff.

745
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:04,445
And nothing makes me sadder than
reading the DevOps subreddit.

746
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:10,355
And listening, er, reading about some
people's struggles, in, in the practice.

747
00:41:10,395 --> 00:41:14,015
And knowing that, yeah, we've
been at this for a while, but

748
00:41:14,015 --> 00:41:15,145
there's still a lot of work to do.

749
00:41:15,295 --> 00:41:17,305
So, culture.

750
00:41:18,135 --> 00:41:22,055
It's how your organization
connects, right?

751
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:25,555
It's how people connect as humans.

752
00:41:25,765 --> 00:41:27,985
It is in your organization.

753
00:41:28,025 --> 00:41:29,635
It is in your personal life.

754
00:41:29,645 --> 00:41:31,105
It is everywhere, right?

755
00:41:31,835 --> 00:41:35,295
It's built on assumptions,
values, artifacts.

756
00:41:35,795 --> 00:41:40,135
You can improve it, but not always
across the entire organization.

757
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:46,155
So you can make, you know, changes to
your local team culture a lot more easier.

758
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:49,025
And some things about it are just silly.

759
00:41:49,295 --> 00:41:55,985
You know, this screen capture is
a social media post and the top

760
00:41:55,985 --> 00:42:01,235
line is you can gauge a company's
culture by how robust and unhinged

761
00:42:01,315 --> 00:42:03,465
the Slack emoji repertoire is.

762
00:42:03,915 --> 00:42:06,705
And the bottom one is this joke, right?

763
00:42:06,705 --> 00:42:11,275
It's another screen capture from
Slack that is someone posting, Hey

764
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:13,035
team, I have some bittersweet news.

765
00:42:13,345 --> 00:42:16,805
After an incredible one year at
Ramp, this company, I decided

766
00:42:16,815 --> 00:42:18,015
to continue working at Ramp.

767
00:42:18,045 --> 00:42:20,915
Like, you totally, they
had you in the first half.

768
00:42:21,235 --> 00:42:22,575
You thought they were leaving, right?

769
00:42:22,865 --> 00:42:26,735
So, the whole thing is a joke that, I'm
leaving on Friday, I'll be back on Monday.

770
00:42:27,095 --> 00:42:30,315
And, but it's just kind of
framed up as a departure, post.

771
00:42:30,345 --> 00:42:33,105
And then, the emojis are insane, right?

772
00:42:33,105 --> 00:42:33,675
They're everywhere.

773
00:42:33,715 --> 00:42:34,665
It's all kinds of stuff.

774
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:35,425
so.

775
00:42:35,925 --> 00:42:41,945
Lots of ways to sort of gauge culture,
how fun it is, how robust it is, and lots

776
00:42:41,945 --> 00:42:43,635
of ways to influence it down the road.

777
00:42:44,045 --> 00:42:46,835
So some resources for you,
if you'd like some homework.

778
00:42:47,115 --> 00:42:50,465
you've got Cautionary Tales, The
French Knight's Guide to Corporate

779
00:42:50,465 --> 00:42:52,295
Culture, from Tim Harford.

780
00:42:52,555 --> 00:42:56,295
again, this is a great podcast series,
it runs a couple of series a year.

781
00:42:57,125 --> 00:42:59,855
Tim Harford is an
economist based in the UK.

782
00:43:00,115 --> 00:43:02,985
and, very knowledgeable
on a lot of things.

783
00:43:03,545 --> 00:43:07,475
And it was, there was a derivative
of that on a different show.

784
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:09,995
and that one is titled Blood and Gold.

785
00:43:10,315 --> 00:43:12,225
And that's Dan Snow's, podcast.

786
00:43:12,225 --> 00:43:14,355
And I forget what his
show is actually named.

787
00:43:14,745 --> 00:43:19,155
and then you've got a whole
institute from, Professor Sheen.

788
00:43:19,165 --> 00:43:21,175
He sadly passed away in 2023.

789
00:43:21,445 --> 00:43:23,225
But his son keeps this running.

790
00:43:23,485 --> 00:43:26,335
And his, papers and, and
other resources are there.

791
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:26,404
very much.

792
00:43:26,715 --> 00:43:28,295
at sheenocli.

793
00:43:28,335 --> 00:43:28,695
org.

794
00:43:29,195 --> 00:43:31,715
Culture, four keys to why
it matters from McKinsey.

795
00:43:31,725 --> 00:43:33,715
Another interesting one to take a look at.

796
00:43:33,975 --> 00:43:37,475
Sort of a foundational paper
from the folks at McKinsey there.

797
00:43:37,825 --> 00:43:41,685
The, summary paper from, about
Westrom from IT Revolution.

798
00:43:42,005 --> 00:43:47,395
the original paper at NCBI, then
National Library of Medicine at NIH.

799
00:43:47,815 --> 00:43:50,955
And another sort of basic one, right?

800
00:43:50,975 --> 00:43:53,535
What is organizational culture
and why should we care from HBR.

801
00:43:54,205 --> 00:43:58,730
So, Those are sort of some basic
ones that I like to give to people.

802
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:02,400
If you haven't read the
Westrom stuff, start there.

803
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:05,360
That's the easiest one to kind
of grok and get a look at.

804
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:09,090
So, hopefully that was helpful for folks.

805
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:12,610
I'm always happy to chat with folks
who are struggling with things around

806
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:16,880
their culture, especially since I'm
a PagerDuty now, around incident

807
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:22,030
management, automation, post incident
reviews, going on call, you know.

808
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:25,870
Even as a basic sort of assumption,
because lots of folks aren't into that.

809
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,689
So hopefully you enjoy the rest of the
sessions you watch at, Conf42 DevOps,

810
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:32,660
and I'll see you somewhere else.

811
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,420
So, take care.
