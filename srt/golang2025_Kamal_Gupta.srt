1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,750
Hi, my name is Kamel and I
work as software development

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,090
engineer in Amazon, Seattle.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,890
Today I'm going to present
about building high performance

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,750
healthcare ML systems with go.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,610
So this presentation explores how
I am able to leverage GO'S unique

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,390
capabilities to develop machine
learning healthcare solutions with

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,430
remarkable diagnostic accuracy.

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,560
Let's talk about why we use
Go For Healthcare ml. So

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,909
first thing is concurrency.

10
00:00:28,909 --> 00:00:31,400
So goes lightweight, go routines.

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,500
Enable efficient parallel processing of
patient data stream, allowing systems

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,570
to handle thousands of concurrent
analysis with minimal overhead.

13
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,910
Second point was security.

14
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:49,219
So goes, comprehensive security libraries
and memory safe design, create robust

15
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:54,109
protection for patient data, ensuring
hyper compliance while minimizing.

16
00:00:54,514 --> 00:00:57,214
Vulner expose during ML operation.

17
00:00:57,574 --> 00:00:59,314
Third point is performance.

18
00:00:59,314 --> 00:01:04,144
So healthcare application demand
million, millisecond level

19
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:06,514
responsiveness for critical decisions.

20
00:01:06,725 --> 00:01:12,065
So goals compound nature and
compile nature and optimize garbage

21
00:01:12,065 --> 00:01:16,475
collection, deliver exceptional
performance with predictable latency.

22
00:01:16,975 --> 00:01:21,655
So let's talk about the
technical architecture overview.

23
00:01:22,045 --> 00:01:23,185
For our system.

24
00:01:23,185 --> 00:01:29,035
So on right side, I had presented the,
data diagram, like how data was flowing.

25
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:32,214
So high level things was, data ingestion.

26
00:01:32,515 --> 00:01:37,884
So high performance go microservices,
efficient capture and normalized

27
00:01:38,384 --> 00:01:43,184
patient data from click and clinical
devices, EHRs and variables.

28
00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:47,684
So that is like 30 plus
medical data formats.

29
00:01:48,029 --> 00:01:53,219
Which we need to read and we need to do
the result in near, near zero latency.

30
00:01:53,669 --> 00:01:58,769
Second part was ML orchestration, so
custom go wrappers around TensorFlow,

31
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:03,689
coordinate distributed model
execution, enabling parallel feature

32
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,609
extraction and predictive analytic
analytics, which give us the fragmented

33
00:02:08,609 --> 00:02:10,649
healthcare data sets very easily.

34
00:02:11,249 --> 00:02:13,289
And prediction delivery.

35
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:14,279
So real time.

36
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:19,619
Insights are securely transmitted
to clinical work stations and

37
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:23,939
mobile devices via web sockets
with goals, encryption, libraries,

38
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:27,119
ensuring end-to-end hyper compliance.

39
00:02:27,619 --> 00:02:30,449
Now let's look at the
diagnostic accuracy achievement.

40
00:02:30,809 --> 00:02:35,729
So we were able to achieve
94% cardiovascular disease,

41
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:40,539
accuracy, so our algorithms are
able to detect heart diseases.

42
00:02:40,914 --> 00:02:45,384
Markers with unprecedented
accuracy, enabling earlier

43
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:50,874
interventions, and significantly
improving the patient prognosis.

44
00:02:51,324 --> 00:02:53,844
Then second one was the cancer detection.

45
00:02:53,844 --> 00:02:59,214
So we were able to do pretty good
cancer detection and we were able to

46
00:02:59,214 --> 00:03:05,679
identify cancer biomarkers in initial
stages when treatment is most effective,

47
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:08,479
substantially increasing survival rates.

48
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:11,289
Third one is the diagnosis.

49
00:03:11,619 --> 00:03:15,824
We were able to achieve the time
reduction, so it was like we were

50
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:22,299
able to achieve around roughly 68%
of the time reduction, and we are

51
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:28,819
able to reduce pneumonia, diagnosis,
timelines, why 68%, allowing faster

52
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:33,679
clinical decision making and more
timely therapeutic interpretation.

53
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:38,949
Let's talk about the real time
processing in healthcare IO ot.

54
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:43,519
So what we need is, in real
time healthcare iot, we need

55
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,349
the continuous monitoring.

56
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:50,449
So our go microservice process,
10,000 plus vital data points

57
00:03:50,749 --> 00:03:53,654
per second with 99% reliability.

58
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:58,879
The system maintains consistent
sub millisecond response time, even

59
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,159
under peak hospital load conditions.

60
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,799
Second one is the edge processing.

61
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:09,319
So lightweight, optimized go code
runs directly on medical IOT devices,

62
00:04:09,619 --> 00:04:15,259
reducing network bandwidth by 78%
while enforcing end to end data

63
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:21,079
encryption and maintaining hyper
compliance at every processing stage.

64
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,929
Third one is the anomaly detection.

65
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:29,809
So advanced ML algorithms identify
critical patient condition charge changes.

66
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:36,020
Within, two 30 millisecond, which is
like very exceptional and it is an

67
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,059
outperforming traditional monitoring.

68
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:43,369
By 12 times, clinical teams
receive prioritized alerts when

69
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,869
contextual diagnostic recommendation
for immediate intervention.

70
00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:52,854
Let's look at the privacy per
preserving implementations.

71
00:04:52,854 --> 00:04:54,599
So these are differential privacy.

72
00:04:55,269 --> 00:05:01,569
So advanced statistical noise algorithms
protect individual patient records while

73
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:04,269
preserving population level insights.

74
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:07,029
Then second one is the federated learning.

75
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:12,879
So distributed AML training occurs
on device aing raw patient data

76
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,289
transmission across network.

77
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:18,814
Then we were able to do, maintain
the encryption of secure AML

78
00:05:18,869 --> 00:05:23,489
computations, execute directly
on encrypted healthcare data.

79
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:26,064
Without decryption exposure.

80
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:28,524
Then there's a GO Security library.

81
00:05:28,524 --> 00:05:33,684
So cryptographically hardened Go
modules provide the foundational

82
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:38,274
security and infrastructure,
which our team is able to utilize.

83
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,664
Let's talk about the validation framework.

84
00:05:41,694 --> 00:05:45,414
So validation framework is
based on the four stages.

85
00:05:45,414 --> 00:05:49,344
One was the performance testing,
second was the accuracy validation.

86
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:51,264
Third was the clinical integration.

87
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,649
And fourth is the long-term monitoring.

88
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:59,979
So for performance testing, comprehensive
loss testing validates system stability

89
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:05,469
under extreme conditions successfully
processing 10,000 plus concurrent request

90
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:11,019
and accuracy validation, so other models
undergo rigorous validation against

91
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:18,129
gold standard clinical dataset achieving
97% concordance with expert diagnosis.

92
00:06:18,534 --> 00:06:22,404
While continuously improving
through feedback loops, then

93
00:06:22,434 --> 00:06:24,234
for the clinical integration.

94
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:29,604
So clinical workflow studies with
Frontline Healthcare provides,

95
00:06:30,034 --> 00:06:35,914
providers ensure seamless adoption
with 94% of practitioner reporting

96
00:06:35,914 --> 00:06:38,044
enhanced decision making efficiency.

97
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:42,859
And for long-term monitoring, we
have the sophisticated telemetric

98
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:49,099
systems, which track 27 critical
metrics in production environments,

99
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:55,579
providing a statistical confidence
interval of 99.8% for all diagnosis.

100
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:59,199
Passport let looks at the economic impact.

101
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:04,569
So before that, our operating costs
were roughly around a hundred.

102
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:09,179
A hundred, which we were
able to reduce to 75%.

103
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:15,969
Diagnostic time was also
significantly, cut down by 60%.

104
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:22,129
And treatment delays were also,
we are able to reduce by, 50%.

105
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:25,899
Let's track about the
improved patient outcomes.

106
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:29,109
So 76% decrease in the.

107
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:34,359
chronic heart conditions, with our
AML powered predictive care system,

108
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:38,199
enabling patients to proactively
manage their condition at home.

109
00:07:38,619 --> 00:07:40,509
92% complaints.

110
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:46,539
So for medical thing, it is very
important to have the compliance,

111
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:52,209
so medication adherence served with
our AI driven personalized reminder

112
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:58,219
system, representing a dramatic, 39%,
improvement from pre-implementation

113
00:07:58,219 --> 00:08:03,019
baseline, and we were able to redu
increase the compliance to 92%.

114
00:08:03,739 --> 00:08:10,099
And after that we did the patient
satisfaction scores and we had seen

115
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:14,779
it has reached record high as our
ML system delivered faster, more

116
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:18,559
accurate diagnosis and personalized
treatment recommendations.

117
00:08:19,059 --> 00:08:21,129
Let's look at the
implementation challenge.

118
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:24,159
So first thing is the
ML model integration.

119
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:29,979
So integrating TensorFlow models with GO
service required custom binding solutions.

120
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:36,669
We engineered framework specific wrappers
with the optimized memory management to

121
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:40,149
ensure seamless interper interoperability.

122
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,779
Then clinical workflow adapt adaptation.

123
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:49,584
So healthcare prediction required minimal
disruption to established protocols.

124
00:08:49,584 --> 00:08:56,004
We develop intuitive interface that map
directly to existing clinical workflows.

125
00:08:56,394 --> 00:08:59,934
Then third point is
data quality variation.

126
00:09:00,294 --> 00:09:06,504
So data quality can vary
depending upon which system or

127
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,154
how we are processing the data.

128
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:12,744
So clinical data source
from disparate systems.

129
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:18,929
Exhibited, significant format
inconsistency, so goes robust, goes have a

130
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:24,419
robust passing capabilities, which enable
us to implement adaptive normalization,

131
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:30,179
algorithm that standardized inputs while
preserving diagnostic significance.

132
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:32,579
Then regularity compliance.

133
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:37,029
stringent healthcare regulations,
need, comprehensive audit

134
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:38,619
trails and documentation.

135
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:46,069
So our validation framework implemented,
immutable logging of all system divisions,

136
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:51,709
ensuring hyper compliance while supporting
streamlined regularity services.

137
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:55,569
Let's talk about the key
takeaways from this presentation.

138
00:09:55,809 --> 00:10:01,229
So first thing is go excels at, healthcare
ml. So go exceptional performance.

139
00:10:01,544 --> 00:10:08,614
Seamless concurrency and robust security
features help us to utilize, go with the

140
00:10:08,614 --> 00:10:13,834
optimal foundation for critical healthcare
applications requiring unwavering

141
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:17,174
reliability and instantaneous processing.

142
00:10:17,624 --> 00:10:20,264
Second one is the
meaningful clinical impact.

143
00:10:20,264 --> 00:10:26,814
So our system have, quantifiably
enhanced, diagnostic precision by 87%.

144
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:33,279
Isolated treatment delivery by 56% and
substantial, improved patient outcome

145
00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:39,519
across cardiovascular, oncological, and
neurological condition economic benefits.

146
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,459
So healthcare institutions implementing
our go based ML solution have achieved

147
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:51,699
28% operational cost reduction while
simultaneously elevating care quality

148
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:55,344
metrics, translating to a. 3.2 million.

149
00:10:55,344 --> 00:10:59,604
Yeah, that's 3.2 million annual
savings for mid-size hospitals.

150
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:05,214
Future opportunities to go rapidly
expanding ecosystem position, healthcare

151
00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:09,864
organization to leverage increasing
sophisticated ML applications.

152
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:14,540
Paving the way for predictive care model,
personalized medicine protocols and

153
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,970
revolutionary patient engagement system.

154
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,910
Oh, we are at the last slide.

155
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:22,550
So thank you for, listening
to this presentation.

156
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,930
