00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,220
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,315
I'm gr Malu.

3
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,070
I'm a cyber risk consultant.

4
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,780
I'm super excited to be here today
and I will be sharing the strategies

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:14,930
to secure the digital backbone of
our modern world IOT supply chains.

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:21,410
This presentation is made up of my
research and GRC expertise working

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,419
with the highly regulated industries.

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:29,760
Let's move on to the next slides and
learn the practical ex examples and

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,950
the strategies to save IOT systems.

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:38,010
In this slide we talk about the hidden
threat and let me start this slide

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,200
with an example and a quick story.

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,490
A hospital I consulted for a small
four pump from a trusted vendor and

13
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:52,370
the vulnerability hidden tape in the
ware inserted during the manufacturing.

14
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:58,400
Which allowed un authorized taxes and one
component one mistake, and the patient's

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,830
security safety was at risk, right?

16
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,920
This was, this is what makes iot
supply chain attacks so dangerous

17
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,720
and vulnerable attacks don't break
in through the front door anymore.

18
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,280
And the hitch in the right trusted
software updates or embedded component.

19
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:23,110
And because the test is implicit and
no one checks the, and no one even

20
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:28,630
expect that, and the risks, they're
not just limited to one sector.

21
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:34,070
These attacks affect smart homes,
hospitals, schools, airports,

22
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,600
manufacturing floors everywhere.

23
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,825
And let's move on to the next slide.

24
00:01:39,325 --> 00:01:43,365
Here, let's talk about
the AL security gaps.

25
00:01:43,865 --> 00:01:46,565
Unfortunately, we're
still playing a catch up.

26
00:01:46,835 --> 00:01:50,615
Many companies don't have proper
vetting for their suppliers.

27
00:01:50,974 --> 00:01:54,004
Security testing happens
too late, if at all.

28
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:54,390
If at all.

29
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,585
And a lot of networks don't
even have real time monitoring.

30
00:02:00,304 --> 00:02:01,955
But there is a hope.

31
00:02:02,045 --> 00:02:02,945
But we, yes.

32
00:02:03,365 --> 00:02:07,894
Seeing powerful tools emerge
in this modern world, automated

33
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:12,454
vulnerability scams, tamper proof
hardware, behavioral analytics,

34
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,839
that flag anomalies before we occur.

35
00:02:16,684 --> 00:02:23,915
We just have to be willing to adopt these
modern technologies into our environments.

36
00:02:24,575 --> 00:02:26,975
Let's move on to the next slide.

37
00:02:27,475 --> 00:02:31,660
Here we talk about real
world attack examples.

38
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:34,329
You may remember the Mirai botnet.

39
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,399
It is, it used the default passwords
on baby monitors and cameras

40
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:41,529
to create a global DDoS attack.

41
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:42,569
It's not.

42
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:46,019
Thermostat can become a digital grenade.

43
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:51,059
I have also worked with the logistics
organization where smart scanners were

44
00:02:51,059 --> 00:02:53,999
hijacked via compromised firmware.

45
00:02:54,089 --> 00:02:59,219
The attackers gained the foothold into
the backend systems, and it's not a

46
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:04,169
fiction, it's reality, and you can
imagine how huge the impact could be.

47
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:06,469
Let's move on to the next slide.

48
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:10,714
This slide, let's talk about
the complex attack surface.

49
00:03:11,214 --> 00:03:13,604
There are major areas.

50
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:18,404
The vulnerabilities can maintain
things like microcontrollers,

51
00:03:18,904 --> 00:03:23,515
different countries, and often
include hidden and software.

52
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:28,755
Third party code and open source
packages can be out dated or malicious.

53
00:03:29,255 --> 00:03:33,184
Manufacturing contract factors
may not follow security

54
00:03:33,184 --> 00:03:36,065
processes, updates matching.

55
00:03:36,154 --> 00:03:40,834
Imagine if your device update
server gets hacked and suddenly

56
00:03:41,075 --> 00:03:42,935
malware is pushed as in trusted.

57
00:03:42,935 --> 00:03:47,305
Update cloud services if
attackers breach your backend.

58
00:03:47,365 --> 00:03:51,344
The control, they control
every device connected to that.

59
00:03:51,494 --> 00:03:55,244
So let's move on to next slide.

60
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:59,549
Here, let's talk about the
evolving threat landscape.

61
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:02,779
We're not just fighting
solo hackers anymore.

62
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:05,269
Nation states are involved.

63
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:09,299
Ransom gangs, target
hospitals through iot devices.

64
00:04:09,869 --> 00:04:15,799
And these devices are quietly required to,
into encrypted botnets and crypto mining.

65
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:21,679
Botnets and personal data from smart
homes is being sold on the dark webs.

66
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,849
It's our toaster talks.

67
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:30,045
If our toaster talks to our light
hub and they both talk to our

68
00:04:30,045 --> 00:04:33,060
wifi, that's a huge meh of risk.

69
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,370
Let's move on to next slide.

70
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,480
Here we talk about
fortifying our iot ecosystem.

71
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:45,635
And what are the, we had talked about
the challenges and problems, and

72
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:48,065
let's now talk about the solutions.

73
00:04:48,575 --> 00:04:53,615
So we need a design secure
systems from the very beginning.

74
00:04:53,615 --> 00:04:59,615
So that's what secure by design practices,
not patch them after the fact, right?

75
00:04:59,705 --> 00:05:04,375
So think of building earthquake
proof buildings in California.

76
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,450
You don't wait until after the
earthquake to reinforce the structure.

77
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,350
So secure by design practices
testing the vulnerabilities at

78
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,050
each stage would help, really help.

79
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,830
Let's move on to the next slide here.

80
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,345
We talk about secure by design
principles in more detail.

81
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:29,664
Some must have secure
by design principles.

82
00:05:29,965 --> 00:05:33,565
Start with the threat modeling
when designing the new product.

83
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:37,765
Use hardware security
features like Secure Boot.

84
00:05:38,335 --> 00:05:42,955
Assess your suppliers like you
assets your new hires, right?

85
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:48,935
Check their backgrounds and if they
have any secu security breaches history.

86
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,410
So like that and maintain software
will love material, so you always

87
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,110
know what's running on your devices.

88
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:03,159
Let's move on to next slide, which
talks about zero trust architecture.

89
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,280
Assume nothing is safe.

90
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:13,480
Zero trust means every device, every
request, every update must prove

91
00:06:13,635 --> 00:06:16,255
its authenticity and legitimacy.

92
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,630
Each device should have a unique identity.

93
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:25,810
Devices should not talk to
the services they really need.

94
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,040
All communications must be encrypted.

95
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,710
Devices should only get access.

96
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,030
They're absolutely needed.

97
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:39,470
So technically, the role-based access,
and let's move on to the next slide here.

98
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,510
We talk about behavioral
analytics and anomaly detection.

99
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:48,630
We can no longer rely on, only
on signature based detections.

100
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,170
Attackers evolve faster
than signature databases do.

101
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:59,910
Instead, your use behavior modeling, if
your device suddenly sends 10 multiple

102
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,010
multiples of tens, seven hundreds,
it's unusual traffic at 2:00 AM right?

103
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:09,570
And it's worth checking and
keep monitoring that kind

104
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,530
of, the sudden behavior.

105
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,540
Think of it like in Fitness.

106
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:19,150
Tracker knows your usual heart
rate, and so when it spikes without

107
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,880
any explanation, it alerts you.

108
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,680
And let's go to the next slide here.

109
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,280
We talk about the incident
response strategy.

110
00:07:30,045 --> 00:07:35,135
You need, every organization need
a strong incident response plan

111
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:38,270
that works into especially the iot.

112
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:42,285
And so here, let's talk about
the different steps here.

113
00:07:42,585 --> 00:07:46,425
Let's start with the detection
monitor, both digital and physical

114
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:49,580
anomaly anomalies and containment.

115
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,330
Don't shut down the whole network segment.

116
00:07:54,630 --> 00:08:01,670
It's segment it smartly, and investigation
use iot specific forensic tools.

117
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:07,805
Remediation remediate, distribute,
clean will, were securely

118
00:08:08,345 --> 00:08:10,565
and post incidental learn.

119
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:15,875
From the incidents and share the best
practices, what you have learned from

120
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:21,155
the incident, and improve your internal
systems and processes and controls.

121
00:08:21,655 --> 00:08:23,515
Let's move on to the next slide.

122
00:08:24,015 --> 00:08:25,515
Implementation roadmap.

123
00:08:26,085 --> 00:08:30,735
You don't need to solve everything
at single step or overnight.

124
00:08:31,485 --> 00:08:33,435
Start with a maturity assessment.

125
00:08:33,705 --> 00:08:40,735
Then follow the steps, eliminate default
passwords, increase the password policy

126
00:08:40,975 --> 00:08:47,240
change the password policy strengthening
the password and do basic segmentation.

127
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:52,130
Build cross-functional teams across
security, supply chain and product.

128
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:59,120
Track metrics, live metrics, real time
metrics to detect time time to fix them.

129
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,145
And let's move on to the next slide.

130
00:09:03,645 --> 00:09:09,365
So in previous slides we talked about
the implementation roadmap and here.

131
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,420
Let's talk about proven results of
implementing those security standards

132
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,450
and how that roadmap helps you.

133
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:23,690
Organizations that adopt these practices
experience fewer breaches, maintain

134
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:29,860
uptime during, detect issues, early and
significantly reduced tampering incidents.

135
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,770
So these are very helpful.

136
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,470
To detect the issues early,
vulnerabilities early, and to

137
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,930
keep the systems safe and secure.

138
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,440
Let's move on to the next slide,

139
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,050
the path forward.

140
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:50,350
So we have gone through the issues,
real time examples and the roadmaps,

141
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,170
best practices, and the proven results.

142
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,110
Now let's see the what's next?

143
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:03,130
Manufacturers need to prioritize security,
even under pressure to cut costs, right?

144
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:07,350
So the cutting the cost
should not compromise the

145
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,990
quality or security anymore.

146
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,470
Supply chains must
become more transparent.

147
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,715
Organizations must invest in
long term and not cheapest part.

148
00:10:18,215 --> 00:10:22,355
And we need better regulations
and continuous innovation,

149
00:10:22,475 --> 00:10:27,665
especially around lightweight
cryptography for Internet of things.

150
00:10:28,165 --> 00:10:32,995
And let's move on to the next slide
here, securing the connector Future.

151
00:10:33,325 --> 00:10:40,075
Let's talk about how iot security is not
just a checkbox and it's a commitment.

152
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,690
So we need the technical excellence, yes.

153
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,940
But also the collaboration
and cultural shift.

154
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,600
It's, it everyone in the
organization should feel that

155
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,070
it's their responsibility.

156
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,180
It's not just the risk and security
teams to secure the organization.

157
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,850
It's everyone's responsibility.

158
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:03,200
And being aware of the threats
and risks happening in the

159
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,850
industry is very much important.

160
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:10,150
We need technical excellence, but
also the collaboration, the cultural

161
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:14,160
shift, as I discussed the collaboration
with the different teams in the

162
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,080
organization is very much important.

163
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,320
Let's stop waiting for
the next big act to act.

164
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,770
Let's build trust into
our connected future.

165
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,180
And let's move on.

166
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:26,890
And these are.

167
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:32,950
Thank you so much for being here today
and I hope this gave you some practical

168
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:40,240
insights and inspiration towards securing
the IO OT supply chains and I'm happy to

169
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,120
connect and continue the conversation.

170
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:47,020
Please do connect with me on
