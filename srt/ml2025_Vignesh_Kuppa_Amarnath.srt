00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:07,260
Greetings to 100 presenter today in
today's software world, data mapping

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:13,350
and transformation plays a critical
role to illustrate this, imagine

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,990
two servers, one can understand w
English and the other W Spanish.

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,970
For them to communicate successfully,
there need to be a mechanism or

5
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,640
system in place that can translate the
data from one language to the other,

6
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:36,989
ensuring that each server can understand
process and respond appropriately.

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,530
Now, imagine if this mechanism was
cognitive functioning like a digital

8
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,099
human brain, such a system would not.

9
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,960
Just translate.

10
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,620
It would understand contest, intent,
and adapt dynamically, much like

11
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,630
a person would, a conversation.

12
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:04,470
This concept can be extended to
support human with disabilities, such

13
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:10,080
as those with hearing impairments
where the system could convert

14
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,210
speech into text in real time.

15
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,470
Individuals with.

16
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:20,280
Visual impairments where visual data could
be transformed into audio descriptions.

17
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,830
People with colorblindness where
colors can be translated into

18
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:32,729
patterns, labels, or other sensory
cue, a cognitive system, enhance this.

19
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:39,240
Even further by learning users
preferences, recognizing patterns, and

20
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,730
delivering information in a personalized,
accessible, and meaningful way.

21
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,990
Just like the servers that overcome
language barriers, through smart

22
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:58,450
transformation, cognitive systems can
bridge the accessibility gap, making

23
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,540
technology more inclusive for everyone.

24
00:02:03,925 --> 00:02:09,865
