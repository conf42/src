1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,569
Speaker 37: Hi, my name is Cha Calwell.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:07,270
I'm a product manager and co-presenting
here with me on this particular topic

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:13,509
is Smoothie Chand, who is a principal
engineer and we both work at Adobe today.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:19,750
At this hour, we are gonna dive into
the evolution of a really key piece of

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,270
marketing tech called Center Optimization.

6
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:24,460
So let's get going.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:32,099
You know, for many years we as marketers
are totally obsessed with one question,

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,960
and that question is, what is the
absolute best time to send a message?

9
00:00:37,635 --> 00:00:38,565
Why is this important?

10
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:43,394
It's important because marketers
and brands think that there is a

11
00:00:43,394 --> 00:00:49,124
high probability of you opening a
particular message or a notification

12
00:00:49,304 --> 00:00:50,985
at this so-called past time.

13
00:00:51,404 --> 00:01:00,074
But what if I told you that this is not
enough, or this might not be entirely the

14
00:01:00,074 --> 00:01:02,535
right question to ask in today's scenario.

15
00:01:03,075 --> 00:01:03,465
Why?

16
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:09,015
Because we are in a digital era
where there is so much of noise

17
00:01:09,515 --> 00:01:15,005
and that is ever growing and those
important digital signals are just

18
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:17,164
getting lost in this whole noise.

19
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:24,695
So today we are going to dig
into and see how this best time.

20
00:01:25,295 --> 00:01:34,505
Has to turn itself into a decision making
system that can change the game and

21
00:01:34,744 --> 00:01:40,955
you as marketer or brands, how you can
evolve and talk to your bus customers

22
00:01:41,105 --> 00:01:43,655
in a better and a more efficient way.

23
00:01:44,524 --> 00:01:53,054
So for that, we really have to move
out of the shoes of marketer and think.

24
00:01:53,554 --> 00:02:00,505
As a consumer or a customer and understand
the reality and what is that reality?

25
00:02:00,595 --> 00:02:06,565
And the reality is basically there is
a never ending flood of digital noise.

26
00:02:06,895 --> 00:02:09,025
How do we swim through this?

27
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:12,415
And think about it every single.

28
00:02:13,225 --> 00:02:19,585
We as customers or consumers, our
phones, our inboxes are buzzing

29
00:02:19,585 --> 00:02:25,045
with notifications, emails,
text messages, you name it.

30
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:32,665
It's basically a digital battlefield
that companies brands have created

31
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:38,935
and every single brand is fighting
for that tiny slice of attention.

32
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:40,785
And what if I told you that?

33
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,150
This is not enough.

34
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,570
And this particular statement out
here, you know, tells all about that.

35
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,340
And it might sound a little weird, but
this is the fact we have to all face it.

36
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,150
We have amazing tools.

37
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:04,544
Every product, every customer have built
these tools that tell you, Hey, this is

38
00:03:04,544 --> 00:03:07,184
the perfect time to hit the send button.

39
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:13,919
And they have nailed it to the
minute, and yet we see customers or

40
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,519
consumers like us are just tuning out.

41
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:23,449
And this tuning out is
not happening today.

42
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:27,049
It's happening over a period
of time, if you have noticed.

43
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:31,819
So what is really happening and
what are these consequences?

44
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,939
Well, the consequences are
pretty clear, honestly.

45
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,939
As you can see here, right?

46
00:03:36,179 --> 00:03:37,469
We are in a digital era.

47
00:03:37,619 --> 00:03:45,239
We have so much that we have to face in
terms of digital noise, engagement rates.

48
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,489
Things like clicks and
opens have flatlined.

49
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:51,029
Why?

50
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,829
Because there is a wall that we have
created between all of those digital

51
00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:00,239
noise that we only tend to open.

52
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:05,459
Those important messages that we
feel appropriate, and only then the

53
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:08,879
clicks and the opens would go up.

54
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:10,459
Why is it flatlining?

55
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,839
Because of the digital noise and
all of those personalizations.

56
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:23,059
As marketers, as brands we put in those
messages feel very mechanical and robotic.

57
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:23,449
Why?

58
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:28,609
Because we are not even opening those
messages for the most of the time.

59
00:04:29,109 --> 00:04:38,299
So all of those personalizations that has
been implemented, that has been gaining

60
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:42,949
so much of prominence over the years,
all of that is going down the drain.

61
00:04:43,489 --> 00:04:43,789
Why?

62
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:48,739
Because in the first place, we
are missing the real human touch.

63
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:51,699
So we got a focus.

64
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:59,429
On the Who, because typically the focus,
all this while has been on the when and

65
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:04,739
we really forgot about the who and the who
being the CUS customer or the consumer.

66
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:08,219
So how did we get here in the first place?

67
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:15,179
Let's kind of settle back, rewind for
a minute and look at the tool that was

68
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:17,414
supposed to solve all of this for us.

69
00:05:18,104 --> 00:05:24,284
And for a while it really was
a complete game changer, right?

70
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:31,004
We wanted those messages at the time
when I am free, when I am sipping my

71
00:05:31,004 --> 00:05:34,274
coffee, but it has not been working.

72
00:05:34,754 --> 00:05:35,444
So let's see.

73
00:05:35,944 --> 00:05:40,744
The tool that was supposed to solve
all of these problems for us was sent

74
00:05:40,744 --> 00:05:46,264
time optimization, or STO for shot,
and the idea behind it was very simple.

75
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:54,744
The plan was to use machine learning
technology to scan all of our

76
00:05:54,984 --> 00:06:01,104
customer past behavior to predict
the exact moment that we're most

77
00:06:01,104 --> 00:06:06,494
likely to open our next message, and
the process here was very simple.

78
00:06:06,994 --> 00:06:13,084
We would analyze all the engagements,
which is typically the open and the click.

79
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:17,734
You would train a model and feed
this particular data so that it can

80
00:06:18,064 --> 00:06:25,354
spot patterns in your data and can
spit out a personalized best time

81
00:06:25,474 --> 00:06:28,174
for every single person on your list.

82
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,354
The whole goal was here.

83
00:06:31,954 --> 00:06:40,084
Very much laser focused on one thing, and
that one thing was the absolute best time

84
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:43,624
or the highest probability time of a open.

85
00:06:44,124 --> 00:06:50,874
And look, let's be fair, this
worked wonders back in the days and

86
00:06:51,414 --> 00:06:57,534
honestly, even today, some of the
marketing tech has not evolved and

87
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,694
we are following the same old trend.

88
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:02,379
But hey, it worked wonders.

89
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:10,169
Marketing was mostly just about batching
blast email campaigns, weekly newsletters.

90
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:17,179
Well, in these scenarios, STO gave
marketers a massive, massive advantage.

91
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:21,109
But as we all know, the world is changing.

92
00:07:21,109 --> 00:07:22,219
The world has changed.

93
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:27,259
There is so much digital noise, and
the world looks very different now.

94
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:35,839
And this is where it all started
breaking and AI is probably the

95
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:42,679
solution, but if you look back at
the ML that predicted, the send time

96
00:07:42,739 --> 00:07:45,589
optimization sounds so very limited.

97
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:47,939
So the biggest.

98
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:55,539
The massive advantage that we got from ML
suddenly started showing its weakness, and

99
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:59,559
this quote absolutely nails the problem.

100
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:03,959
High probability does
not equal high wisdom.

101
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,399
Let's take an example.

102
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:11,519
Let's say my ML or the
prediction model tells me that.

103
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:18,929
10:30 AM is the most probable time
when I as a customer, sipping my

104
00:08:18,929 --> 00:08:22,799
coffee would be opening my email.

105
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:30,069
But imagine there's so many other emails,
notifications coming in at the same time.

106
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:31,684
So as a brand.

107
00:08:32,184 --> 00:08:33,684
Am I fighting with other brands?

108
00:08:33,684 --> 00:08:34,524
Of course you are.

109
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:39,564
Am I fighting with my own other campaigns?

110
00:08:39,744 --> 00:08:40,824
Yes, of course.

111
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:45,384
In that particular context,
sending a message do you

112
00:08:45,384 --> 00:08:46,734
think is a wise thing to do?

113
00:08:47,544 --> 00:08:50,094
Mull upon it, you will know what it does.

114
00:08:50,594 --> 00:08:54,164
Let me give you a small example here.

115
00:08:54,974 --> 00:08:59,984
This whole predictive model
is kind of a one trick point.

116
00:09:00,484 --> 00:09:08,374
It's really good at just one trick, but it
does not answer the bigger, more important

117
00:09:08,374 --> 00:09:14,224
questions that are very pertinent
in today's agent era of marketing.

118
00:09:14,794 --> 00:09:18,934
Questions like, should we even send
this message in the first place?

119
00:09:19,144 --> 00:09:24,724
Or, Hey, has this person
already heard from us?

120
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:27,199
Multiple times during the day.

121
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:34,819
Does this message even make sense for
where the customer is in their journey?

122
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:38,419
All that crucial context is just gone.

123
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:42,609
Or the prediction model is not
accounting for all of that.

124
00:09:43,109 --> 00:09:46,769
That is where AI comes in the picture.

125
00:09:47,249 --> 00:09:51,659
That is where decisioning
has to happen and.

126
00:09:52,214 --> 00:09:55,895
That is the game changer because why?

127
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:57,874
There's so many scenarios.

128
00:09:58,145 --> 00:10:00,964
The context is lost,
the world has changed.

129
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:09,515
Marketing in this modern era isn't just
about simple linear campaigns anymore.

130
00:10:10,055 --> 00:10:14,704
It's a messy, a real time
cross channel conversation.

131
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,444
And if you're only focused on timing.

132
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:22,010
You are not having a conversation,
you are just shouting into

133
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,410
the void that we have created.

134
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,210
And that brings us to
this massive evolution.

135
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:36,420
We are moving beyond the simple
question of when to a deeper, much

136
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:42,480
more prominent, much more smarter
question, and that big shift from.

137
00:10:42,795 --> 00:10:46,935
Prediction to true AI decisioning is here.

138
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:56,584
If companies and brands do not adopt
it, they are just creating or adding

139
00:10:56,584 --> 00:10:58,385
to that particular digitalize.

140
00:10:58,885 --> 00:11:01,765
Okay, now this slide.

141
00:11:02,265 --> 00:11:07,290
It is everything and it sums it all On
one hand, we have got the old school

142
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,520
STO, it just asks what time is the best.

143
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,610
It's looking at one signal to optimize.

144
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:19,410
One metrics like open rate, but
on the other hand we have AI based

145
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:25,020
decisioning and it's asking a totally
different, but a very smart question.

146
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,020
What is the best action from.

147
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,565
Best time.

148
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:34,935
The best action is the evolution,
and the best action to take right

149
00:11:34,935 --> 00:11:41,415
now is to send or to postpone
or to cancel in the first place.

150
00:11:41,915 --> 00:11:45,335
It's using multiple signals.

151
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:48,335
It is creating of context.

152
00:11:48,845 --> 00:11:53,185
It is becoming more probabilistic.

153
00:11:53,685 --> 00:11:58,575
From deterministic when there
is probability or when there is,

154
00:11:59,075 --> 00:12:03,605
there is decisioning, and when
there is decisioning, there is ai.

155
00:12:04,115 --> 00:12:09,535
And AI we all know does a better
job than the humans or the ml,

156
00:12:10,035 --> 00:12:16,335
and is using this multiple signals
to make a decision that optimizes

157
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,525
the entire customer relationship.

158
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,650
Don't you think this is a game changer
and we are entering into a different

159
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,540
ball together, ball game altogether?

160
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,840
I hope you all acknowledge that today.

161
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,110
So what are these signals?

162
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:39,910
As I said, it is looking at, of
course, your best prediction for the.

163
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,340
Best time.

164
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:47,490
Yes, that is a key ingredient,
no doubt, but it's just one

165
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,100
voice at a very crowded table.

166
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:55,410
The AI is also considering things
like where the customer is in the

167
00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:01,290
journey, how many messages we have
sent to a particular customer.

168
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:06,280
In a given day or in a given
week, what are our business rules?

169
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,810
Are there quite ours?

170
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,180
Are there fatigue rules?

171
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:17,010
It weighs in on all of these factors
and it makes a decision, or it is

172
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,140
giving us as marketers a choice.

173
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:24,650
And that is where human
come into the picture.

174
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,250
Human as a service in ai.

175
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:31,420
This is what exactly it means,
and we have a choice to make.

176
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:38,230
Alright, let's see this in action because
this is where it gets really cool when

177
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,020
I've got one customer say one message.

178
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,630
Let's look at how each system would
handle this exactly in the same scenario.

179
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:51,720
First up, the classic prediction model,
it crunches the numbers from the past.

180
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,290
You know it.

181
00:13:53,055 --> 00:13:58,605
And it says, Hey, probably 10, 10:30
AM that's the time with the highest

182
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,615
probability of an open send it.

183
00:14:00,945 --> 00:14:02,625
It's as simple as it is.

184
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:07,815
It's data-driven and well
completely blind about the

185
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:10,395
context, but it still recommends.

186
00:14:10,895 --> 00:14:11,915
But now what?

187
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:17,585
What the AI decisioning engine
Engine does, it gives that.

188
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,330
Of course the 10:30 AM prediction, as I
said, it is also a key in gradient, but

189
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,790
it is also considering many other factors.

190
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,940
So what are those factors?

191
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,960
We just talked about it.

192
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,750
Are there messages that were already sent?

193
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,130
Are there F rules?

194
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,329
Are there quiet times?

195
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:39,699
So the AI's decision, it says in
this particular scenario, hold.

196
00:14:40,165 --> 00:14:47,125
Don't send a message, and that right
there is where AI starts to feel

197
00:14:47,305 --> 00:14:55,435
like less of a machine and more
like a human with a lot of wisdom.

198
00:14:55,935 --> 00:14:57,724
Does it resonate with you?

199
00:14:58,654 --> 00:14:58,984
Yes.

200
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:00,634
As a consumer, of course.

201
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,905
And that one decision.

202
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:08,055
The decision to not send a message is
an absolute game changer, as I said.

203
00:15:08,504 --> 00:15:16,244
And that is the fundamental shift away
from chasing short-term metrics towards

204
00:15:16,244 --> 00:15:20,025
building long-term customer trust.

205
00:15:20,175 --> 00:15:25,185
That is where the whole business
impact us, and this particular business

206
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:31,694
impact is not just getting you the
engagement that you are wanting for.

207
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:38,099
But for brands, it lasts because
you're not burning out your audiences.

208
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:46,924
You get lower turn rates because you
stop annoying people into unsubscribing.

209
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:54,634
And most importantly, you build real
trust by showing your customers that

210
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:58,114
you respect their time and their inbox.

211
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:06,064
And this is definitely a competitive
edge that no open rate can ever buy.

212
00:16:06,064 --> 00:16:11,664
I, and so when you zoom out, you can
really see the clear evolutionary path.

213
00:16:12,609 --> 00:16:15,789
We started with a very
clunky manual thing.

214
00:16:15,969 --> 00:16:22,529
Then we got smarter with ML based
prediction, and now the smartest

215
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:26,939
brands are moving into the future,
which is AI based decisioning.

216
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:33,899
This isn't just about better tech,
it's the evolution of marketing itself

217
00:16:34,469 --> 00:16:41,489
from just blasting messages to inte
intelligently orchestrating conversations.

218
00:16:42,404 --> 00:16:45,644
So I wanna leave you
with this final thought.

219
00:16:46,244 --> 00:16:50,534
For so long, we have been completely
obsessed with finding the perfect time,

220
00:16:50,924 --> 00:16:57,374
but this shift forces us to ask a better
question and more important question,

221
00:16:57,824 --> 00:17:00,224
are we creating the right movement?

222
00:17:00,404 --> 00:17:06,494
Because as we have just seen, the best
time to send is totally meaningless

223
00:17:06,704 --> 00:17:08,649
if it's the wrong movement to engage.

224
00:17:09,149 --> 00:17:13,050
And with that said, I don't
want to create any more noise.

225
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:21,170
I would turn the mic to my colleague
who the, to dive into the technical

226
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:26,930
details and the nuances on the
technical side of this whole journey.

227
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:28,159
Thank you.

228
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:28,879
From my side.

229
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:29,680
Speaker 38: Thanks ti.

230
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,210
Hello everyone.

231
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,270
I am Ti Pathy, principal
engineer at Adobe.

232
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,180
Let me show you how this
actually works in practice.

233
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,110
I will walk through a live demo,
then explain the architecture.

234
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,640
Let me start with the core problem.

235
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:49,460
Traditional ML system output predictions
like the user has 73% engagement.

236
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,810
Likelihood or campaign
has 0.82 relevant score.

237
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,400
That's a probability.

238
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:00,140
It tells you what might
happen, but here is the issue.

239
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,230
A perfect prediction can
still make the wrong decision.

240
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,910
What if the user is fatigued?

241
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,240
What if they already received
three messages today?

242
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,370
How do we solve this problem?

243
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,530
What you are seeing here is the
AI stationing layer at the center.

244
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:21,070
The system does not just predict, it
decides it considers multiple ML signals.

245
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,555
Business constraints like message
limits, users, state across campaigns

246
00:18:25,895 --> 00:18:32,035
and a real name context then produces an
action like either send, differ or skip.

247
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:37,770
With reasoning, I will run through
five scenarios that show how the

248
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41,810
systems make trade off between
business goals and user experiences.

249
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,655
For this demo, we'll be using email
as the channel to keep it simple.

250
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:53,605
But the ING framework works identical for
push notifications, SM Sapp messaging.

251
00:18:53,815 --> 00:18:55,675
Basically, it's channel agnostic.

252
00:18:56,455 --> 00:18:57,835
Let's see this in action.

253
00:18:57,895 --> 00:19:01,915
Five scenarios showing how
AI agent balances business

254
00:19:01,915 --> 00:19:03,775
goals with user experiences.

255
00:19:04,135 --> 00:19:05,095
Let's dive right in.

256
00:19:05,595 --> 00:19:11,925
So fresh user, user, one fresh user
scenario that we're talking about.

257
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:15,905
User one, flash sale and
high engagement score.

258
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:18,350
Low fatigue or zero fatigue.

259
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:25,219
So our agent made addition to send the
campaign, and the key factors in this

260
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:29,989
station are the high engagement score,
low fatigue and higher urgency override.

261
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:32,570
Let's look at another scenario.

262
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:35,659
Same campaign, higher engagement row.

263
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:40,110
Higher, higher engagement
score, but fatigue is very high.

264
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:47,834
So look at the fatigue score
zero 0.80, and our agent made

265
00:19:47,845 --> 00:19:49,740
agent to defer this campaign.

266
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,410
Here is a classic example of
prediction, or a perfect prediction

267
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,360
is not equal to the right duration.

268
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:00,500
Traditional systems are, are just a
prediction systems, a predictional

269
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,920
prediction system only, prediction
only system would definitely have

270
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,510
sent this or send this message.

271
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,210
AI agent is smart enough to make
aion and give you the reasoning.

272
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,450
The fatigue score is 0.80
is a key factor here.

273
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:16,660
As it indicates that the user might
be overwhelmed with messages, even

274
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:21,840
though engagement and urgency scores
are are favorable, protecting the

275
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,250
user experience is a priority.

276
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,860
This is the classic example
of how our agent works.

277
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,420
Let's go dive into the third
scenario where user three

278
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,160
we're sending a newsletter.

279
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,530
Low urgency, fresh user.

280
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,540
Ation made is to send, and
the high engagement score and

281
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,340
low fatigue levels, overweigh.

282
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,450
The channel preference.

283
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:46,100
The user is preferring a channel email
channel of high, but it overlays.

284
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,810
And then we, the station was made
by our agent to just sign it.

285
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,170
Let's look at the food scenario, which
is a product update where the urgency

286
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,760
is high channel preferences are there.

287
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:03,399
You see the newsletter one to compare this
product update the channel preference, and

288
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:08,359
it actually sends how to send the respect
respected contact email or channel.

289
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:09,984
That preferred channel.

290
00:21:10,194 --> 00:21:12,414
The preferred channel is true for email.

291
00:21:12,414 --> 00:21:15,984
So we're still sending while the user
is within the daily message, remain.

292
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,204
The high engagement and low 50 across.

293
00:21:18,284 --> 00:21:21,674
Scores indicate that sending
this message now would provide

294
00:21:21,884 --> 00:21:23,204
the best user experience.

295
00:21:23,474 --> 00:21:24,314
That's the reasoning.

296
00:21:24,854 --> 00:21:27,014
Let's look at the final scenario.

297
00:21:27,514 --> 00:21:31,324
Here we have our user too, the
fatigue user, returning back again.

298
00:21:31,364 --> 00:21:33,884
And we are gonna send the
product update to him.

299
00:21:33,884 --> 00:21:35,804
So our trying to send the product update.

300
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:40,984
His fatigue score is still high
and the agent actually persisted.

301
00:21:41,044 --> 00:21:43,474
The per state persisted the state.

302
00:21:43,534 --> 00:21:44,704
Across campaigns.

303
00:21:45,064 --> 00:21:48,244
The fatigue score is high, the key
factor, and standing during a high

304
00:21:48,244 --> 00:21:50,134
fatigue score period, risks annoying.

305
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:52,384
The user and the nation is made to differ.

306
00:21:52,884 --> 00:21:59,064
So look at the final statistics
where we see 60% were sand and 40%

307
00:21:59,064 --> 00:22:01,404
were deferred out of this, right?

308
00:22:01,614 --> 00:22:07,734
The system isn't maximizing sand, it's
basically optimizing for relationships.

309
00:22:08,234 --> 00:22:11,594
So what, what we are, what
we are talking about here is.

310
00:22:12,109 --> 00:22:16,909
This is what, when, when, what
we mean by agent ai, right?

311
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:22,689
So it's not only just the scores,
it's also preserving or balancing how

312
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:25,849
audation is made how AI decides this.

313
00:22:26,524 --> 00:22:28,054
How does we do this station flow?

314
00:22:28,054 --> 00:22:28,864
Let's look at that.

315
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:30,364
How did we build this?

316
00:22:30,995 --> 00:22:36,514
This is three layer architecture where the
first layer is the ML prediction layer,

317
00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:41,614
where you can see here, it uses the four
models, producing scores with confidence.

318
00:22:42,064 --> 00:22:43,924
The second layer is the
AI stationing layer.

319
00:22:44,164 --> 00:22:45,479
The agent that you just saw.

320
00:22:46,184 --> 00:22:49,274
Consumes those signals and
reasons over constraints.

321
00:22:49,814 --> 00:22:53,144
And finally, the state manager,
which tracks finally the state

322
00:22:53,144 --> 00:22:56,684
manager, which tracks user
histories and enforceable limits.

323
00:22:57,464 --> 00:23:01,784
So three layers, three jobs,
predict, decide, and protect.

324
00:23:02,284 --> 00:23:04,999
The, the, the three key takeaways here.

325
00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:10,969
The first one, ML output signals
AI makes Ation a perfect score can

326
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:13,159
still be leading to a wrong action.

327
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:18,049
The second takeaway, isation
layer is a first class system.

328
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:19,819
It's not just business rules.

329
00:23:20,464 --> 00:23:24,484
It's an intelligent agent that
reasons over multiple signals

330
00:23:24,484 --> 00:23:28,024
and constraints that we get from
the output of the ML prediction.

331
00:23:29,014 --> 00:23:34,144
The third takeaway here is scale
requires engineering in production.

332
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:40,199
This runs millions of agents per day
with sub a hundred millisecond latency.

333
00:23:40,904 --> 00:23:42,284
It's a distributed system.

334
00:23:42,634 --> 00:23:44,344
It's a distributed system problem.

335
00:23:44,344 --> 00:23:48,634
State management across competing
campaigns, realtime orchestration,

336
00:23:48,935 --> 00:23:51,939
production, good reliability are required.

337
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:55,769
So one challenge we solved
is the state convention.

338
00:23:56,219 --> 00:23:59,969
Multiple campaigns, campaigns were
competing for the same user as we

339
00:23:59,969 --> 00:24:01,499
saw in the demo at the same time.

340
00:24:01,979 --> 00:24:06,839
Addition layer arbitrates in real
time tracks how many messages the

341
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:11,339
user, each user received today enforce
limits and prevents over messaging.

342
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:19,129
So to wrap it up, we shifted from when
should we send to, should we send at all

343
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:21,979
that required a new architecture layer.

344
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:27,349
That reasons not just simply predict,
this is agent AI in production.

345
00:24:28,129 --> 00:24:31,819
The demo code is on GitHub
and the link is here.

346
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:33,349
Happy to connect on LinkedIn.

347
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,689
Thank you for attending our session.

348
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:36,769
Thanks.

349
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:36,829
Bye.
