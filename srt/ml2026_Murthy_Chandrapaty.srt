1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,570
Speaker 15: Hi, my name is Cha Calwell.

2
00:00:02,779 --> 00:00:07,270
I'm a product manager and co-presenting
here with me on this particular topic

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:13,510
is Smoothie Chand, who is a principal
engineer and we both work at Adobe today.

4
00:00:13,915 --> 00:00:19,735
At this hour, we are gonna dive into
the evolution of a really key piece of

5
00:00:19,735 --> 00:00:22,254
marketing tech called Center Optimization.

6
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:24,475
So let's get going.

7
00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:31,245
For many years we as marketers are
totally obsessed with one question,

8
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:36,465
and that question is, what is the
absolute best time to send a message?

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,070
Why is this important?

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,720
It's important because marketers
and brands think that there

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,610
is a high probability of you
opening a particular message or

12
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,910
a notification at this past time.

13
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:59,000
But what if I told you that this is not
enough, or this might not be entirely the

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,460
right question to ask in today's scenario.

15
00:01:01,985 --> 00:01:02,405
Why?

16
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:07,925
Because we are in a digital era
where there is so much of noise

17
00:01:08,425 --> 00:01:13,915
and that is ever growing and those
important digital signals are just

18
00:01:13,915 --> 00:01:16,075
getting lost in this whole noise.

19
00:01:16,855 --> 00:01:23,605
So today we are going to dig
into and see how this best time.

20
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:33,400
Has to turn itself into a decision making
system that can change the game and

21
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,850
you as marketer or brands, how you can
evolve and talk to your best customers

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,580
in a better and a more efficient way.

23
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:51,970
So for that, we really have to move
out of the shoes of marketer and think.

24
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:59,420
As a consumer or a customer and understand
the reality and what is that reality?

25
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:05,480
And the reality is basically there is
a never ending flood of digital noise.

26
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,970
How do we swim through this?

27
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,365
Think about it.

28
00:02:09,975 --> 00:02:10,645
Every single.

29
00:02:11,145 --> 00:02:17,475
We as customers or consumers, our
phones, our inboxes are buzzing

30
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:22,935
with notifications, emails,
text messages, you name it.

31
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:29,985
It's basically a digital battlefield
that companies brands have created

32
00:02:29,985 --> 00:02:36,305
and every single brand is fighting
for that tiny slice of attention.

33
00:02:37,295 --> 00:02:38,645
And what if I told you that?

34
00:02:39,245 --> 00:02:40,025
This is not enough.

35
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:44,365
And this particular statement
out here, tells all about that.

36
00:02:44,545 --> 00:02:49,105
And it might sound a little weird, but
this is the fact we have to all face it.

37
00:02:50,095 --> 00:02:52,915
We have amazing tools.

38
00:02:53,415 --> 00:03:01,334
Every product, every customer have built
these tools that tell you, Hey, this is

39
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:03,975
the perfect time to hit the send button.

40
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:10,709
And they have nailed it to the
minute, and yet we see customers or

41
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:14,309
consumers like us are just tuning out.

42
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:20,209
And this tuning out is
not happening today.

43
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:23,809
It's happening over a period
of time, if you have noticed.

44
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:28,609
So what is really happening and
what are these consequences?

45
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,490
The consequences are
pretty clear, honestly.

46
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,520
As you can see here, right?

47
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,050
We are in a digital era.

48
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:41,820
We have so much that we have to face in
terms of digital noise, engagement rates.

49
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:47,070
Things like clicks and
opens have flatlined.

50
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:47,610
Why?

51
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,380
Because there is a wall that we have
created between all of those digital

52
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,820
noise that we only tend to open.

53
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,040
Those important messages that we
feel appropriate, and only then the

54
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,459
clicks and the opens would go up.

55
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,010
Why is it flatlining?

56
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,420
Because of the digital noise and
all of those personalizations.

57
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:19,640
As marketers, as brands we put in those
messages feel very mechanical and robotic.

58
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,029
Why?

59
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:25,190
Because we are not even opening those
messages for the most of the time.

60
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:34,709
So all of those personalizations that has
been implemented, that has been gaining

61
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:39,359
so much of prominence over the years,
all of that is going down the drain.

62
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:40,199
Why?

63
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,149
Because in the first place, we
are missing the real human touch.

64
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:48,079
So we got a focus.

65
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:55,809
On the Who, because typically the focus,
all this while has been on the when and

66
00:04:55,809 --> 00:05:01,119
we really forgot about the who and the who
being the CUS customer or the consumer.

67
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,599
So how did we get here in the first place?

68
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:10,349
Let's held back, rewind for a
minute and look at the tool that was

69
00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:12,584
supposed to solve all of this for us.

70
00:05:13,244 --> 00:05:19,424
And for a while it really was
a complete game changer, right?

71
00:05:19,604 --> 00:05:26,144
We wanted those messages at the time
when I am free, when I am sipping my

72
00:05:26,144 --> 00:05:29,414
coffee, but it has not been working.

73
00:05:29,894 --> 00:05:30,584
So let's see.

74
00:05:31,084 --> 00:05:35,884
The tool that was supposed to solve
all of these problems for us was sent

75
00:05:35,884 --> 00:05:41,404
time optimization, or STO for shot,
and the idea behind it was very simple.

76
00:05:41,904 --> 00:05:49,914
The plan was to use machine learning
technology to scan all of our

77
00:05:50,154 --> 00:05:56,244
customer past behavior to predict
the exact moment that we're most

78
00:05:56,244 --> 00:06:01,664
likely to open our next message, and
the process here was very simple.

79
00:06:02,164 --> 00:06:07,024
We would analyze all the
engagements, which is typically

80
00:06:07,144 --> 00:06:08,254
the opens and the click.

81
00:06:08,614 --> 00:06:12,904
You would train a model and feed
this particular data so that it can

82
00:06:13,234 --> 00:06:20,524
spot patterns in your data and can
spit out a personalized best time

83
00:06:20,644 --> 00:06:23,344
for every single person on your list.

84
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,554
The whole goal was here.

85
00:06:27,094 --> 00:06:35,284
Very much laser focused on one thing, and
that one thing was the absolute best time

86
00:06:35,404 --> 00:06:38,794
or the highest probability time of a open.

87
00:06:39,294 --> 00:06:46,044
And look, let's be fair, this
worked wonders back in the days and

88
00:06:46,554 --> 00:06:52,704
honestly, even today, some of the
marketing tech has not evolved and

89
00:06:52,884 --> 00:06:54,864
we are following the same old trend.

90
00:06:55,284 --> 00:06:57,564
But hey, it worked wonders.

91
00:06:58,494 --> 00:07:05,384
Marketing was mostly just about batching
blast email campaigns, weekly newsletters.

92
00:07:05,954 --> 00:07:10,724
In these scenarios, STO gave
marketers a massive advantage.

93
00:07:10,724 --> 00:07:14,044
But as we all know, the world is changing.

94
00:07:14,044 --> 00:07:15,184
The world has changed.

95
00:07:15,424 --> 00:07:20,479
There is so much digital noise, and
the world looks very different now.

96
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:29,059
And this is where it all started
breaking and AI is probably the

97
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:35,899
solution, but if you look back at
the ML that predicted, the send time

98
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:38,839
optimization sounds so very limited.

99
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:41,189
So the biggest.

100
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:48,819
The massive advantage that we got from ML
suddenly started showing its weakness, and

101
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:52,839
this quote absolutely nails the problem.

102
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:57,239
High probability does
not equal high wisdom.

103
00:07:57,719 --> 00:07:58,679
Let's take an example.

104
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:04,769
Let's say my ML or the
prediction model tells me that.

105
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:12,209
10:30 AM is the most probable time
when I as a customer, sipping my

106
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:16,079
coffee would be opening my email.

107
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:23,349
But imagine there's so many other emails,
notifications coming in at the same time.

108
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:24,964
So as a brand.

109
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:26,994
Am I fighting with other brands?

110
00:08:26,994 --> 00:08:27,834
Of course you are.

111
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:32,874
Am I fighting with my own other campaigns?

112
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,104
Yes, of course.

113
00:08:34,604 --> 00:08:38,174
In that particular context,
sending a message do you

114
00:08:38,174 --> 00:08:39,524
think is a wise thing to do.

115
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:42,884
Mull upon it, you will know what it does.

116
00:08:43,384 --> 00:08:46,954
Let me give you a small example here.

117
00:08:47,734 --> 00:08:51,774
This whole predictive model
is a one trick pointing.

118
00:08:52,274 --> 00:09:00,164
It's really good at just one trick, but it
does not answer the bigger, more important

119
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:06,014
questions that are very pertinent
in today's agent era of marketing.

120
00:09:06,584 --> 00:09:10,724
Questions like, should we even send
this message in the first place?

121
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:16,514
Or, Hey, has this person
already heard from us?

122
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:18,989
Multiple times during the day.

123
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:26,609
Does this message even make sense for
where the customer is in their journey?

124
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:30,209
All that crucial context is just gone.

125
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:34,399
Or the prediction model is not
accounting for all of that.

126
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:38,464
That is where AI comes into picture.

127
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:43,354
That is where decisioning
has to happen and.

128
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:47,454
That is the game changer because why?

129
00:09:48,114 --> 00:09:49,434
There's so many scenarios.

130
00:09:49,704 --> 00:09:52,524
The context is lost,
the world has changed.

131
00:09:52,854 --> 00:10:01,074
Marketing in this modern era isn't just
about simple linear campaigns anymore.

132
00:10:01,614 --> 00:10:06,264
It's a messy, a real time
cross channel conversation.

133
00:10:06,474 --> 00:10:08,034
And if you're only focused on timing.

134
00:10:08,964 --> 00:10:13,584
You are not having a conversation,
you are just shouting into

135
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:15,984
the void that we have created.

136
00:10:16,484 --> 00:10:19,785
And that brings us to
this massive evolution.

137
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:27,995
We are moving beyond the simple
question of when to a deeper, much

138
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:34,025
more prominent, much more smarter
question, and that big shift from.

139
00:10:34,354 --> 00:10:38,494
Prediction to true AI decisioning is here.

140
00:10:39,394 --> 00:10:48,204
If companies and brands do not adopt
it, they are just creating or adding

141
00:10:48,204 --> 00:10:50,004
to that particular digitalize.

142
00:10:50,504 --> 00:10:53,384
Okay, now this slide.

143
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:58,919
It is everything and it sums it all On
one hand, we have got the old school

144
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:03,119
STO, it just asks what time is the best.

145
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:06,239
It's looking at one signal to optimize.

146
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:11,009
One metrics like open rate, but
on the other hand we have AI based

147
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:16,649
decisioning and it's asking a totally
different, but a very smart question.

148
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:19,649
What is the best action from.

149
00:11:20,234 --> 00:11:21,194
Best time.

150
00:11:21,344 --> 00:11:26,535
The best action is the evolution,
and the best action to take right

151
00:11:26,535 --> 00:11:33,045
now is to send or to postpone
or to cancel in the first place.

152
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:37,484
It's using multiple signals.

153
00:11:37,874 --> 00:11:40,454
It is creating of context.

154
00:11:41,025 --> 00:11:45,155
It is becoming more probabilistic.

155
00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:50,545
From deterministic, when there
is probability or when there is

156
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:56,504
probability, there is decisioning, and
when there is decisioning, there is ai.

157
00:11:56,925 --> 00:12:03,755
And AI we all know does a better
job than the humans or the ml, and

158
00:12:03,755 --> 00:12:09,845
it is using this multiple signals
to make a decision that optimizes

159
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:12,455
the entire customer relationship.

160
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:18,160
Don't you think this is a game changer
and we are entering into a different

161
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,050
ball together, ball game altogether?

162
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,350
I hope you all acknowledge that today.

163
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,590
So what are these signals?

164
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:33,420
As I said, it is looking at, of
course, your best prediction for the.

165
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,850
Best time.

166
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:41,000
Yes, that is a key ingredient,
no doubt, but it's just one

167
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,610
voice at a very crowded table.

168
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:48,890
The AI is also considering things
like where the customer is in the

169
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:54,800
journey, how many messages we have
sent to a particular customer.

170
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,040
In a given day or in a given
week, what are our business rules?

171
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,570
Are there quite ours?

172
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,940
Are there fatigue rules?

173
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:10,800
It weighs in on all of these factors
and it makes a decision, or it is

174
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,835
giving us as marketers a choice.

175
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:18,345
And that is where human
come into the picture.

176
00:13:18,845 --> 00:13:20,944
Human as a service in ai.

177
00:13:21,185 --> 00:13:25,115
This is what exactly it means,
and we have a choice to make.

178
00:13:25,745 --> 00:13:31,925
Alright, let's see this in action because
this is where it gets really cool when

179
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:34,714
I've got one customer say one message.

180
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:40,295
Let's look at how each system would
handle this exactly in the same scenario.

181
00:13:40,795 --> 00:13:45,385
First up, the classic prediction model,
it crunches the numbers from the past.

182
00:13:45,385 --> 00:13:45,820
You know it.

183
00:13:46,735 --> 00:13:52,285
And it says, Hey, probably 10, 10:30
AM that's the time with the highest

184
00:13:52,285 --> 00:13:54,295
probability of an open send it.

185
00:13:54,505 --> 00:13:56,305
It's as simple as it is.

186
00:13:56,305 --> 00:14:02,065
It's data driven, and completely
blind about the context,

187
00:14:02,515 --> 00:14:03,805
but it still recommends.

188
00:14:04,305 --> 00:14:09,505
But now what the AI decisioning
in the engine does, it gives that.

189
00:14:10,005 --> 00:14:14,865
Of course the 10:30 AM prediction, as I
said, it is also a key in gradient, but

190
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:17,355
it is also considering many other factors.

191
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:19,475
So what are those factors?

192
00:14:19,475 --> 00:14:20,495
We just talked about it.

193
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:23,254
Are there messages that were already sent?

194
00:14:23,314 --> 00:14:24,665
Are there fat fatigue rules?

195
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:25,864
Are there quiet times?

196
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:31,234
So the AI's decision, it says in
this particular scenario, hold.

197
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:38,645
Don't send a message, and that right
there is where AI starts to feel

198
00:14:38,854 --> 00:14:46,984
like less of a machine and more
like a human with a lot of wisdom.

199
00:14:47,484 --> 00:14:49,244
Does it resonate with you?

200
00:14:50,145 --> 00:14:50,474
Yes.

201
00:14:50,535 --> 00:14:52,124
As a consumer, of course.

202
00:14:52,624 --> 00:14:54,425
And that one decision.

203
00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:59,545
The decision to not send a message is
an absolute game changer, as I said.

204
00:15:00,055 --> 00:15:07,764
And that is the fundamental shift away
from chasing short-term metrics towards

205
00:15:07,764 --> 00:15:11,545
building long-term customer trust.

206
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:16,254
That is where the whole business
impact us, and this particular

207
00:15:16,254 --> 00:15:21,685
business impact is not just getting
you the engagement that you are.

208
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:27,220
Wanting for, but for brands,
it lasts because you are not

209
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,620
burning out your audiences.

210
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,485
You get.

211
00:15:30,985 --> 00:15:38,245
Lower turn rates because you stop
GNA people into unsubscribing.

212
00:15:38,725 --> 00:15:45,594
And most importantly, you build real
trust by showing your customers that

213
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:49,074
you respect their time and their inbox.

214
00:15:49,374 --> 00:15:57,055
And this is definitely a competitive
edge that no open rate can ever buy.

215
00:15:57,555 --> 00:16:02,494
And when you zoom out, you can really
see the clear evolutionary path.

216
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,974
We started with a very
clunky manual thing.

217
00:16:06,184 --> 00:16:12,774
Then we got smarter with ML based
prediction, and now the smartest

218
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:16,914
brands are moving into the future,
which is AI based destining.

219
00:16:17,414 --> 00:16:19,664
This isn't just about better tech.

220
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:26,984
It's the evolution of marketing itself
from just blasting messages to in

221
00:16:27,644 --> 00:16:31,004
intelligently orchestrating conversations.

222
00:16:31,904 --> 00:16:35,054
So I wanna leave you
with this final thought.

223
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,019
For so long we have been completely
obsessed with finding the perfect time,

224
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:46,889
but this shift forces us to ask a better
question and more important question,

225
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:49,709
are we creating the right movement?

226
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:55,979
Because as we have just seen, the best
time to send is totally meaningless

227
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:58,254
if it's the wrong movement to engage.

228
00:16:58,754 --> 00:17:02,684
And with that said, I don't
want to create any more noise.

229
00:17:02,984 --> 00:17:10,294
I would turn the mic to my colleague,
would be chance by the, to dive into the

230
00:17:10,294 --> 00:17:16,534
technical details and the nuances on the
technical side of this whole journey.

231
00:17:17,464 --> 00:17:17,794
Thank you.

232
00:17:17,794 --> 00:17:18,514
From my side.
