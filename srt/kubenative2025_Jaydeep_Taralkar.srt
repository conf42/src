1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:01,440
Good morning.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,610
Good afternoon, everybody.

3
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:07,210
My name is jd. I'm here to talk about
one of the significant transformation

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,829
happening in the financial industry.

5
00:00:09,329 --> 00:00:10,949
Let's get into the presentation.

6
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:16,180
My screen is visible scaling
AI driven financial services.

7
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,120
So simplifying.

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,379
We are, we will be deep diving how we
use a technology like Kubernetes to

9
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:30,600
build and manage the powerful systems,
those arely driven and at massive scale.

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:37,040
The core challenge we are facing is not
just making AI work, but making it work

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,980
responsibly for everyone everywhere.

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,030
So we are in the midst
of financial revelation.

13
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:48,430
The world, the financial world
is changing at the speed.

14
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,060
And AI is the engine.

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,590
It's a driving factor.

16
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,470
This transformation it's
creating an incredible new

17
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,809
opportunities for first time.

18
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:04,780
We have tools accurately assist
the risk and provide the services

19
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,640
to unbanked population that
has not been historically and.

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,710
Under the governance or was
excluded from the financial system.

21
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:21,260
And the biggest example we have seen
back in India in 2014 when Han accounts

22
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,550
were being opened at the scale.

23
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,539
But this power brings complexity, right?

24
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:30,619
How to scale the fraud detection
systems handle millions of

25
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:32,570
transactions every minute.

26
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:37,744
How to ensure the credit scoring
models are fair across dozens of

27
00:01:37,744 --> 00:01:40,145
countries and cultures, right?

28
00:01:40,744 --> 00:01:43,835
This is where the cloud
native services comes in.

29
00:01:44,195 --> 00:01:50,195
They provide the architecture foundation
we need to build the AI systems on

30
00:01:50,855 --> 00:01:56,945
that are not only powerful, but are
scalable and responsible and ethical.

31
00:01:57,425 --> 00:01:58,504
Today's journey.

32
00:01:58,554 --> 00:02:02,545
When we look at it like first, if we
look at the first challenge that we could

33
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:09,795
define here in the roadmap is scaling,
of course and scaling the AI solutions.

34
00:02:10,545 --> 00:02:14,474
The second we will explore here
the container solutions like

35
00:02:14,504 --> 00:02:18,200
Kubernetes orchestration patterns,
and that forms the backbone of.

36
00:02:18,809 --> 00:02:19,649
The model system.

37
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:25,019
And third, we will focus on ethical
integration, discussing how we

38
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:29,249
embed the governance into our
technology, workflow, et cetera.

39
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:34,599
And finally, it comes to putting this all
together in the real world implementation

40
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:39,699
and see how this concepts bring together
the best practices at the scale.

41
00:02:39,779 --> 00:02:40,979
Let's skip cracking.

42
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:45,289
So the core challenge as
we discussed is scaling.

43
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:48,319
The financial market
is incredible dynamic.

44
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:55,009
All AI system must scale instantly
to handle sudden market volatility

45
00:02:55,069 --> 00:03:00,499
or transaction spikes during
the peak hours while maintaining

46
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:04,914
the response times measurably
in microseconds or milliseconds.

47
00:03:05,414 --> 00:03:06,404
That's a big challenge.

48
00:03:06,904 --> 00:03:11,554
The traditional monolithic system
simply cannot scale or keep on.

49
00:03:12,094 --> 00:03:16,234
Imagine a single, massive application
that is trying to handle fraud

50
00:03:16,234 --> 00:03:21,294
detection at a global sales like
Thanksgiving or Black Friday, right?

51
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:25,524
And while simultaneously running
the credit algorithms for millions

52
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:27,714
of users, it becomes a bottleneck.

53
00:03:27,954 --> 00:03:30,504
Elasticity just isn't there, right?

54
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,964
So what's the solution for that?

55
00:03:33,075 --> 00:03:38,834
The solution to this problem is scaling
scaling, using content orchestration.

56
00:03:38,864 --> 00:03:43,424
With Kubernetes as a leading platform,
it's built on key principle First

57
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:45,984
is microservice architecture.

58
00:03:46,034 --> 00:03:51,554
We here we break down the massive
monolithic systems into a smaller,

59
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:53,954
independent, scalable services.

60
00:03:54,869 --> 00:04:02,630
Think of it like a giant entangled
ball of yarn and set for netting

61
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,339
instead of that, an individual
falls, which can do better, right?

62
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,530
Second is dynamic scaling
Kubernetes can automatically add

63
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,090
or remove resources in real time.

64
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,180
It's like a horizontal scaling,
upscaling and downscaling

65
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,010
possible at the peak hours.

66
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:26,910
Imagine at the start of trading session
in NASDAQ or New York market opens,

67
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,400
it's sudden spike in the market required
massive resources, but then eventually

68
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,065
it goes down and we need to have a system
that withstands all those load and.

69
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,490
Dynamically scales itself and that
all is possible using Kubernetes.

70
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,320
And the third is multi-region
deployment which allows us to distribute

71
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,720
our services across the global.

72
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,000
It's critical because of globalization.

73
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,220
And it is critical for performance,
resilience and meeting the regional

74
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,105
compliance policies, which we will
be deep diving in, in, in a while.

75
00:05:02,605 --> 00:05:04,435
Serving the unbanked.

76
00:05:04,535 --> 00:05:08,705
Now let's connect the technology that
we just discussed back to people, right?

77
00:05:08,765 --> 00:05:13,205
This scalable cloud native is
what makes it possible to serve

78
00:05:13,265 --> 00:05:15,065
previously unreached population.

79
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:20,255
We can build mobile first credit
scoring models for emerging markets.

80
00:05:21,035 --> 00:05:26,375
We can process alternate data like
mobile phone, using utility and payments

81
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:31,445
or user patterns, et cetera, to create
a financial profile for those who

82
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:33,695
traditionally don't have a credit history.

83
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:41,110
And we can use containerized, NLP and
natural language processing models to

84
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:47,320
offer support for dozens of languages and
making it more reachable to the people.

85
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,275
You of a different culture, different
language background, et cetera.

86
00:05:52,205 --> 00:05:58,025
This is a financial inclusion in action,
a power of smart architecture, and

87
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,585
this is exactly what we need, right?

88
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:01,555
Ethical challenges.

89
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:07,425
If we look at it like as our
AI system expands, any small

90
00:06:07,425 --> 00:06:14,175
underlying bias in our model gets
amplified across millions of users.

91
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:19,575
Think of it, a model that
unfairly penalize a certain

92
00:06:19,605 --> 00:06:23,055
demography in one city, could now.

93
00:06:23,835 --> 00:06:29,465
Do it across the entire continent,
countries and this distributed

94
00:06:29,465 --> 00:06:34,375
environment, environments,
ethical government stops being

95
00:06:34,765 --> 00:06:36,985
just a design consideration.

96
00:06:37,165 --> 00:06:38,845
It becomes critical.

97
00:06:39,115 --> 00:06:41,185
It's like now you need it.

98
00:06:41,545 --> 00:06:45,145
You must have it like and think, right?

99
00:06:45,745 --> 00:06:48,850
Infrastructure concerns should be
managed consistently and constantly.

100
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,080
So let's look into that,
how we embed our ethics.

101
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,390
So how do we build the governance
into our infrastructure?

102
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,640
We can use cloud native principles.

103
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,810
What is that like?

104
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:06,600
First is policy as a code, we embed our
ethical rules and fairness guidelines

105
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,940
directly into our deployment PowerPoints.

106
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,950
This means the more that model
doesn't meet, our fairness criteria

107
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,600
can be automatically blocked.

108
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:20,870
Even before reaching the production,
second is automated mon monitoring.

109
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,890
We build continuous bias detection,
fairness, checks directly

110
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,450
into our monitoring checks.

111
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:31,930
It is like having a smoke detector,
which is always on for biases, right?

112
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,700
And third is audit trails.

113
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:37,570
It's very vital to have an
immutable unchangeable logs that

114
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,330
can be for every model decision.

115
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,210
Governance action taken.

116
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:48,660
And this provides a very high level
of transparency and even meets the

117
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,970
regulatory requirements, which are
critical in banking or financial industry

118
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,550
technical implementation.

119
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,400
Plat, and let's get bit
more technical here.

120
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:03,400
These governance principles are
implemented through specific patterns in.

121
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,160
Model lifecycle management.

122
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:12,110
We use CICD pipelines to manage our
models from deployment to production, from

123
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,110
staging to productions and transition.

124
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:22,010
This includes GitHubs Jenkins, like
pipelines to clear versioning of a

125
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:26,690
model to have clear versioning running
automatic fairness test before they.

126
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,960
Testing staging environment
before the reach to production.

127
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:36,500
And we use cannery deployment to roll new
models to small subset of the users to

128
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:43,100
monitor the bias, fairness, and limit the
back to limited people, and then fully

129
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,900
release it into the production, right?

130
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,540
This is tried into observability.

131
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:52,560
We tie this all steps into what is
called as continuous monitoring, right?

132
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,610
And observability.

133
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,050
We don't just track CPU
and memory utilization.

134
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,920
That's a traditional way of doing things.

135
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,780
But we build the custom metrics
that can track the model fairness

136
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,860
and and in real time, and.

137
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,720
We can use distributor tracking to
understand the entire path of decision

138
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:19,350
making as well, and set up an automated
alert if the biasness metrics crosses

139
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,090
certain predefined thresholds.

140
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,800
So

141
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:27,570
multi judiciary compliance as in a
financial, global, financial world, right?

142
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:32,790
You have to deal with the complex
web of international laws.

143
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,970
Kubernetes provides a tool to manage
this for region data re residency.

144
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:45,500
It's one of the very critical, or
very much a strict law of land, right?

145
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,490
We can use the rule to ensure that
the data for specific countries

146
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,860
stays within the specific countries.

147
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,130
Like for example, Germany, Zurich
they want their data to store

148
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,510
geographically on the same servers.

149
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:05,695
Residing on their own land as very
much possible for regulatory reduction.

150
00:10:05,755 --> 00:10:11,915
We can configure our Kubernetes
services that are for regional

151
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:16,715
laws and policies without having to
rebuild the entire stuff from scratch.

152
00:10:17,615 --> 00:10:19,080
That's a massive leap actually.

153
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:19,920
And.

154
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,740
Cross border coordination.

155
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:26,810
Now having a global system, financial
organizations do need some coordination

156
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:31,610
in what do you say, cooperations or
collaboration between two regions.

157
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:38,030
And this technology like service
mesh can manage secure communication

158
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:42,580
between different regions and we can
achieve the coordination of cross

159
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,685
border while abiding to all the
rules and regulations of the country.

160
00:10:47,185 --> 00:10:48,295
Let's see.

161
00:10:48,685 --> 00:10:53,095
Put together all of this and see
the real world case study, a global

162
00:10:53,095 --> 00:10:55,165
financial fraud detection system.

163
00:10:55,465 --> 00:11:02,315
The challenge is massive processing,
say a hundred million transactions a day

164
00:11:02,825 --> 00:11:08,440
across more than 30 countries with with
with response times, which is under.

165
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,750
A hundred milliseconds, all while
ensuring that the models are

166
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,500
fair and not being flagged for
certain user groups of Biasness.

167
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,680
That's a massive challenge.

168
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,330
The solution architecture is exactly
what we have been discussing.

169
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,360
Kuber clusters are deployed
in each major region.

170
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:32,380
The real time model serves the
Easter service like mesh to

171
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,680
have a secure communication
between two different regions.

172
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:43,570
The the model monitoring systems like
Prometheus or Grapha or AppDynamics

173
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:48,900
can handle the biasness and track
the model's, fairness and other

174
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,790
customer metrics in real time.

175
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:57,780
Finally a ops workflow or Jenkins
workflows that automates the

176
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:02,160
deployment with built-in Gates
to check ethical validations.

177
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:05,325
Before the new models are being live

178
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:09,875
performance resilience, of course,
in the financial organizations,

179
00:12:10,265 --> 00:12:12,005
the system must be rock solid.

180
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:17,285
This architecture provides high
availability through multiple zones,

181
00:12:17,285 --> 00:12:19,835
deployments, ensuring near perfect uptime.

182
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:22,595
It delivers elastic scaling.

183
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:27,675
We have discussed that for handling
transactional spikes or without

184
00:12:27,675 --> 00:12:29,595
overspending on infrastructure.

185
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:36,650
And it has security integrated built
in every layer from network policies

186
00:12:36,775 --> 00:12:40,855
to the port security standards to
protect the institute financial

187
00:12:40,855 --> 00:12:43,885
information or financial data,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

188
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:48,790
These are all critical factors that
needs to be considered in performance

189
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:53,730
and re part of your architecture
key implementation strategy.

190
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,050
If you remember just three
things from today, right?

191
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:02,665
Let's let them be like three
keys or three strategies, right?

192
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,105
Start with governance now.

193
00:13:04,605 --> 00:13:09,135
Don't treat ethics as an afterthought,
as we already discussed, how

194
00:13:09,135 --> 00:13:10,545
badly it can impact, right?

195
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:18,135
Build your fairness frameworks before you
scale because the problem can replicate to

196
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:23,450
global population and it can become a very
massive, big problem and amplify itself.

197
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,300
Monitor continuously.

198
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,220
That's the second key, right?

199
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,730
Deploy comprehensive observability for
both technical parameters, fairness, and

200
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:39,790
all of the custom parameters that you find
in must have for the entire framework.

201
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,550
Automate everything.

202
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,365
Think of it as.

203
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:49,650
As using GitHubs or Jenkins and
policy as a code is enforcing

204
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:54,210
governance and consistency across
each and every environment.

205
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,580
It becomes more reproducible
and replicable also.

206
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,980
All of these things will just bring
a lot of efficiency when you want to

207
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,780
deploy these things or this architecture
in different geographical region.

208
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,860
Think about it.

209
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,240
Without automation, it's highly
impossible to achieve all the leaf

210
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,130
that we discussed in a given time.

211
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,820
What's the path forward, right?

212
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,390
So the cloud native technologies like
Banes are no longer just about efficiency.

213
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,460
They are essential infrastructure
for scaling, AI driven

214
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,990
financial services responsible.

215
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:38,480
By integrating ethical governance
directly into our technical workflows

216
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:42,290
we can finally build systems that
serves global population while

217
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:48,220
maintaining the transparency, fairness
that the future of finance demands.

218
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,080
And we have seen them in detail, right?

219
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,625
To leave you with one thought, right?

220
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:59,425
The future of financial inclusion depends
upon the ability of scale AI systems.

221
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,520
There are both technically
robust and equally sound.

222
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,920
With this, I would like to
thank you all for attending

223
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,810
and giving your valuable time.

224
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,270
I am happy to answer all your questions.

225
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:18,140

the screen or with my LinkedIn account.

226
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,430
