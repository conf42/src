00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,720
Hello everyone and thank
you for tuning into Con 42.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,410
I'm sat and I'm today excited to walk
you through how predictive analytics

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,690
and machine learning are not just
enhancing but fundamentally reshaping

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,370
the way we approach population health.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:23,730
In the next few minutes, we
will look at how data, when used

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,470
intelligently and ethically can drive
not only better healthcare outcomes.

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,740
But also more equitable
and cost effective systems.

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,730
We will cover the challenges we
face, the methods we are using,

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,620
and the impact we are already
seeing in real world population.

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,040
The population health challenge.

11
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,530
Let's begin by addressing
the core challenge.

12
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:51,945
Across the healthcare ecosystem,
around 60% of our organization

13
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:57,045
struggle to identify and proactively
manage high risk populations.

14
00:00:57,585 --> 00:00:59,805
This is not due to the lack of will.

15
00:01:00,165 --> 00:01:04,875
It's often due to the data silos,
outdated infrastructure, and

16
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:07,215
limited access to integrated tools.

17
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:13,425
Product two Care enabled by the
right analytics has been shown

18
00:01:13,425 --> 00:01:15,555
to reduce hospitalizations.

19
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,330
By 25% and improve preventive
care enhanced by 30%.

20
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,880
We are talking about a real
shift from episode care to

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,530
continuous personalized support.

22
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:35,175
And these insights come from diverse
healthcare studies conduct across

23
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,680
35 states, leveraging data from the
C-D-C-C-M-S and institution like

24
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,990
Mayo Clinic and Kaiser Permanente.

25
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,460
The 360 degree patient view.

26
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,110
To make predictive care effective,
we must start with a complete

27
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,780
360 degree view of each patient.

28
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,170
We do this by integration, three key
types of data, clinical records from EHRs,

29
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:08,295
utilization and cost data from claims and
social determinants of health, or SDOH.

30
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,120
By combining these, we gain not just a
medical snapshot, but an understanding

31
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,980
of the context behind a patient's
health, their environment, income,

32
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,020
education, even housing stability.

33
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:28,080
With advanced ETL pipelines, secure
API Gateways and HL seven FHI

34
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,270
compliance, we ensure this data
is both producted and accurate.

35
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,320
Validated over 99.7% of accuracy.

36
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,680
The result, A foundation we can trust
for making life impacting decisions,

37
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,730
risk stratification models.

38
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:54,000
Next, we apply risk stratification using
supervised machine learning models.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,660
Train on over 8.5 million patient records.

40
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:03,120
We evaluate over 3000 variables,
including lab results, medication

41
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,980
adherence, utilization patterns.

42
00:03:05,295 --> 00:03:07,425
And even socioeconomic inputs.

43
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:12,735
We use algorithms like random forest
and gradient boosting, which have

44
00:03:13,095 --> 00:03:18,765
outperformed traditional logical
regressions, delivering 87 to 92%

45
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:24,435
prediction accuracy in anticipating
hospitalization within a six month window.

46
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:33,375
This lets us bucket patients into four
tires, high risk, rising risk, low risk.

47
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,420
And healthy each time received a
tailored intervention plan from

48
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,680
intensive care management to
wellness and education initiatives.

49
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,649
This personalization at scale is what
moves the needle in population health.

50
00:03:52,135 --> 00:03:53,519
Predict predictive analytics.

51
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:59,910
The results speak volumes in studies
Over 30,000 patients compare it to

52
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:01,834
predictive models, to traditional core.

53
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,040
Readmission dropped by 20%.

54
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,550
Er, we see visits decreased by 30%.

55
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,060
Overall health cost reduced by 20%.

56
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,870
Perhaps more importantly, patient
engagement increased by 40% with

57
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:23,010
higher appointment attendance and
better follow through of care plans.

58
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,780
All of this was achieved using
statistically significant

59
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,475
method of EAB testing and.

60
00:04:31,155 --> 00:04:37,275
Prosperity score matching, ensuring the
outcomes were in just al. Predictive

61
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:43,995
analytics isn't just about risk scores,
it's about outcome, impact, and equity.

62
00:04:46,664 --> 00:04:51,315
Geo special healthcare analytics, one
of the most powerful and sometimes

63
00:04:51,315 --> 00:04:53,474
overlooked tools in our arsenal.

64
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,544
Geo hospital analytics.

65
00:04:56,985 --> 00:05:02,655
Using GIS technology, we map disease
prevalence, resource usage, and care

66
00:05:03,045 --> 00:05:06,615
access across gaps entire regions.

67
00:05:07,545 --> 00:05:12,675
With this insight, we have helped
organizations identify healthcare deserts,

68
00:05:13,035 --> 00:05:19,575
designing mobile outreach programs, and
even optimize where to place new clinics.

69
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:25,035
For example, you by using catchment
area modeling and ISOP prone maps.

70
00:05:25,635 --> 00:05:32,295
We improved facility placement efficiency
by over 40%, reducing both patient

71
00:05:32,325 --> 00:05:34,125
travel time and operational strain.

72
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:39,135
This brings precision to
population health, right

73
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:40,844
care, right place, right time,

74
00:05:43,215 --> 00:05:44,835
machine learning applications.

75
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:50,750
Let's not drive deeper into how machine
learning fits into this equation.

76
00:05:51,825 --> 00:05:54,615
We aggregate vast data sets from EHRs.

77
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,320
Labs pharmacy records to
socioeconomic indicators.

78
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,219
Our models range from decision
trace to deep neural networks,

79
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,380
the undercover patterns that would
take years to identify manually.

80
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:13,130
For instance, one model flags patients
at risk of readmission based on subtle

81
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:20,300
combinations of medication refill
patterns and prior claims data with What's

82
00:06:20,355 --> 00:06:22,915
key here is not just prediction, but.

83
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,580
Inter interpretability, we ensure
clinics can understand why a

84
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,740
model made a recommendation.

85
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,650
Fostering trust and adoption

86
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,420
case study, chronic disease management.

87
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,230
A example comes from a regional
health system serving 150,000 people,

88
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,620
mostly between the ages of 45 and 75.

89
00:06:49,025 --> 00:06:53,795
With the high diabetics burden,
they implemented our predictive

90
00:06:53,795 --> 00:07:00,185
platform focused on hba one C trends,
medication adherence, and social data.

91
00:07:00,935 --> 00:07:06,470
Over 18 months of diabetic
admissions dropped by 42%, thus

92
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,750
saved 3.2 million annually.

93
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,965
Even more powerful was the feedback loop.

94
00:07:13,745 --> 00:07:17,315
Real-time patients outcome
were fed back into the system.

95
00:07:17,735 --> 00:07:19,745
To continuously adjust care plans.

96
00:07:20,195 --> 00:07:23,945
It's not just a dashboard,
it's living a learning system

97
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:28,295
addressing healthcare disparities.

98
00:07:28,835 --> 00:07:35,675
A core value of this work is health
equity using SDOH and claims data.

99
00:07:36,185 --> 00:07:42,515
We identify undeserved population
based on a zip code, ethnicity,

100
00:07:42,665 --> 00:07:45,455
income, and access of access to care.

101
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:51,680
We partner with LO local organizations
to design culturally sensitive outreach

102
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,480
programs like mobile screening vans
and translated education materials.

103
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:03,260
We also monitor equity KPIs to track the
long term success of these interventions.

104
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:09,320
Analytics isn't just for efficiency,
it's for about fairness and inclusion

105
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,040
implementation roadmap.

106
00:08:13,685 --> 00:08:18,695
Implementing predictive analytics
isn't a plugin and plug and play task.

107
00:08:19,205 --> 00:08:25,475
It requires structured roadmap,
data integration connection, EHR

108
00:08:25,535 --> 00:08:31,985
claims and SDOH sources, securely
and consistency analytics, depart,

109
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:37,715
develop, deployment, test and refine
predictive models, train staff on

110
00:08:37,715 --> 00:08:40,475
BI dashboards, workflow integration.

111
00:08:41,015 --> 00:08:44,855
Embed insights into real world
clinical processes without

112
00:08:44,855 --> 00:08:47,885
disruption, continuous improvement.

113
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:55,925
Use a op plan, do study, act, look
to recalibrate models and expand.

114
00:08:56,464 --> 00:08:56,944
Reach.

115
00:08:57,694 --> 00:08:59,255
Change management is key.

116
00:09:00,065 --> 00:09:05,405
We work closely with stakeholders to
ensure clinicals are supported not over.

117
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:08,990
Key takeaways.

118
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,750
Let's recap the core insights from today.

119
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,230
Integrated data creates
a complete patient view.

120
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,980
Predictive analytics shifts care
from reactive to proactive hospital

121
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,790
analytics, add geographic precision.

122
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,740
Machine learning powers smarter,
faster decision and equity

123
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,660
must remain front and center.

124
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:38,150
We are not just building models, we
are building better healthcare future.

125
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:45,470
Thank you for so much
time on in joining me.

126
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,240
It's an existing exciting time
to be in healthcare technology.

127
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:56,420
With the right tools and frameworks, we
can transform not just systems, but lives.

128
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,690
Let's continue building healthcare system.

129
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,700
That are intelligent,
inclusive, and truly impactful.

130
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:06,319
Thank you very much.

131
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,180
Thanks for joining me at Con 42.

132
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,050
Have a good day.
