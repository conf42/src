1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,349
Good morning everyone, and
thank you for joining me today.

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,000
As global supply chain becomes more
complex and interconnected, the risks we

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,970
face from fraud to equipment failures are
not just increasing, they are compounding.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,090
In fact, recent studies shows that a
single disruption can cascade and impact

5
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,310
nearly half of downstream operations.

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,790
But what if your supply
chain could see this?

7
00:00:26,674 --> 00:00:30,994
These risks coming and fix
them before they cause damage.

8
00:00:31,385 --> 00:00:35,645
Today I will walk you through a
cutting edge, a powered framework

9
00:00:35,705 --> 00:00:38,675
for anomaly detection and
self failing in supply chains.

10
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:43,145
We will explore how advanced
techniques like graph neural networks,

11
00:00:43,385 --> 00:00:45,395
transformers, and blockchain back.

12
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,480
Smart contracts are D driving a
real-time decisions, automating

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,860
responses, and saving millions
both in dollars and downtime.

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,830
Let's dive into the future of resilient
and intelligent supply chains, the

15
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,020
growing complexity of supply chains.

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,780
Let's begin by
understanding the landscape.

17
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:09,085
Fortune 500 companies now work
with over 10,000 suppliers across

18
00:01:09,115 --> 00:01:11,245
more than 10 TH one 30 countries.

19
00:01:11,745 --> 00:01:16,935
This incredible web of connections
introduces vulnerabilities at every level.

20
00:01:17,505 --> 00:01:22,905
As a result, we have seen a two
17% increase in risk exposure, and

21
00:01:23,145 --> 00:01:28,155
when a critical node fails, 43% of
downstream operations are impacted.

22
00:01:29,085 --> 00:01:31,185
How about the financial consequences?

23
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:35,835
An average of one $84 million in
annual losses per organization.

24
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:41,565
This clearly shows a traditional
reactive approaches no longer surface

25
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:44,345
the real time event processing framework.

26
00:01:44,915 --> 00:01:50,975
To address this, we need real time
responsiveness and with the help of Apache

27
00:01:50,975 --> 00:01:56,555
Flink and Kafka streams, these platforms
allow us to process massive volumes

28
00:01:56,555 --> 00:01:58,715
of events with millisecond latencies.

29
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:05,015
For example, Flink handles up to 500
events per second with the latency under

30
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:11,735
8.3 millisecond and Kafka mayonnaise
23.4 milli million events per minute.

31
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:17,705
All this is orchestrated under
Kubernetes with K native, ensuring

32
00:02:17,885 --> 00:02:24,395
99.995% availability and seamless
scaling for event driven systems,

33
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,175
advanced anomaly detection with ai.

34
00:02:27,505 --> 00:02:31,225
Now, how do we find disruptions
before they escalate?

35
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:39,445
GNS are key supply chains naturally
form graphs and GNS help detect

36
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:46,135
anomalies within these complex
networks with 92.7% accuracy and

37
00:02:46,345 --> 00:02:49,615
68.3% reduction in false positives.

38
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:52,975
They fair outperform traditional methods.

39
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:59,140
Transformer based models known for
handling time series data identified

40
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:05,350
76.2% of anomalies at least 14
days before conventional methods.

41
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:14,165
With fine tuning, we achieve 83.7%
accuracy using just 200 labeled anomalies.

42
00:03:14,665 --> 00:03:20,125
Explainable A with powerful
models, explainability is crucial.

43
00:03:20,605 --> 00:03:27,925
We use sharp values to highlight which
features influence predictions with the

44
00:03:27,925 --> 00:03:35,005
top three features, often contributing
64.7% of the outcome, reducing

45
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:36,895
investigation time by nearly half.

46
00:03:37,395 --> 00:03:39,555
Counterfactual explanations.

47
00:03:39,765 --> 00:03:44,925
Let operators test what if scenarios
Improving intervention success by

48
00:03:45,015 --> 00:03:49,275
32.6% and attention visualizations.

49
00:03:49,275 --> 00:03:56,595
Highlight suspicious nodes in the
transaction graph, achieving 86.3%, source

50
00:03:56,595 --> 00:03:59,445
identification in under four minutes.

51
00:03:59,945 --> 00:04:04,129
The self-healing capabilities,
detection is only part of the puzzle.

52
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:07,959
What happens after an anomaly is detected.

53
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,999
Our framework supports full
self feeling, kept full self

54
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:14,759
feeling using Apache airflow.

55
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:21,360
We orchestrate workflows that dynamically
adapt to disruption scenarios.

56
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:30,424
The meantime to resolution has dropped
from 27.3 hours to just 4.8 hours.

57
00:04:30,924 --> 00:04:34,945
82.4% improvement.

58
00:04:35,695 --> 00:04:40,435
We detect, analyze, remediate,
and continuously learn.

59
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:44,395
It is a full lifecycle
of intelligent response.

60
00:04:44,895 --> 00:04:52,669
The automated inventory rebalancing a
helps prevent problems, not just fix them.

61
00:04:53,169 --> 00:05:00,609
Through dynamic rebalancing, the system
reduces stockouts by 64.7% and cuts

62
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:09,939
excess inventory by 37.8%, saving $3.4
million annually for a mid-size company.

63
00:05:10,454 --> 00:05:16,444
All while maintaining a service
level above 98.5%, the smart

64
00:05:16,444 --> 00:05:18,904
contract validation via blockchain.

65
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:24,094
Blockchain technology ensures
trust in a decentralized ecosystem.

66
00:05:24,544 --> 00:05:29,914
Using Hyperledger Fabric, we
validate transactions securely and

67
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:38,014
eliminate 97.4% of disputes with the
settlement times improving by 89.3%.

68
00:05:38,774 --> 00:05:45,374
Smart contracts enforce compliance
automatically removing 73 manual

69
00:05:45,374 --> 00:05:49,784
checks per transaction and
achieving a hundred percent accuracy

70
00:05:49,994 --> 00:05:53,054
across 2 37 transaction types.

71
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:58,804
Human AI collaboration, even with
automation, humans are still critical.

72
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:04,204
We use chart ops bots integrated
with Slack and Microsoft

73
00:06:04,204 --> 00:06:05,974
teams to alert users quickly.

74
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,809
Cutting awareness time from 73
minutes to just 9.3 minutes.

75
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:18,399
Our knowledge base helps operators
to solve normal issues, 41.7%

76
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:23,859
faster, and through continuous
learning loops, the system evolves

77
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:29,864
with each incident, reducing false
positives by nearly 9% every quarter.

78
00:06:30,364 --> 00:06:31,264
Everything is good.

79
00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:35,974
However, the performance and results
metrics, let's wrap up with impact.

80
00:06:36,394 --> 00:06:39,604
87% reduction in undetected fraud.

81
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:49,564
62% decrease in disruption duration, 43%
improvement in inventory metrics, 91% of

82
00:06:49,624 --> 00:06:51,814
anomalous detected within five minutes.

83
00:06:52,314 --> 00:06:59,274
Most organizations saw Voes under
10 months, and clearly nearly

84
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:02,154
90% exceeded their expectations.

85
00:07:03,084 --> 00:07:05,154
These are not marginal gains.

86
00:07:05,214 --> 00:07:06,474
They are transformative.

87
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:13,039
In summary, modern supply chain
demand more than just visibility that

88
00:07:13,044 --> 00:07:15,379
require intelligence and autonomy.

89
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:21,020
With AI at the core, organizations
can detect anomalous in minutes,

90
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:26,599
reduce disruptions significantly, and
optimize operations with confidence.

91
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:32,060
The future of supply chain resilience
is not just automated, is not just

92
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:36,739
only automated, but explainable,
secure and human centered.

93
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:40,369
With this, I close, my presentation.

94
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:42,589
Thank you all for your attention.

95
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:45,349
I look forward to see your
questions and thoughts.
