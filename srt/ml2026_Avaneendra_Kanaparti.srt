00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,140
Speaker 9: Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,290
Welcome to the Con 42
Mission Learning Conference.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,570
I'm Ra Kati, and today I will
present a topic that answers a

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,890
very pertinent question within the
credit card industry and how we can

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:18,210
leverage one of the most trending
technologies to answer that effectively.

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,340
And the topic is maximizing credit card
profitability with mission learning

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,140
driven customer lifetime value.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,160
Before we jump in, by way of introduction.

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,509
I'm the director for data analytics
at American Express, primarily

10
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,989
focusing on small business and
commercial credit card customers.

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,930
In my role, I leverage advanced analytics
and mission learning to design strategies

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:47,450
that drive incremental spend and lend
behaviors among customers while balancing

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,170
the customer value and experience that
we offer through the various products

14
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,290
and managing the business risk prudently.

15
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:58,809
In my career spanning over 15 years,
I have been with major financial

16
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:04,300
institutions like Capital One and discover
across various business units, driving

17
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,889
product strategies, risk and response
modeling to predict customer behaviors

18
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,090
and growing the business profitability
while balancing customer experience.

19
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:18,520
Today, I wish to share the knowledge and
insights that I have gained over the years

20
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,680
through my hands-on experience with you.

21
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,280
Now let's take a quick look at what's
to come First, we'll start with the

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,000
high level overview of the credit card
dynamics, along with the review of the

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,830
various challenges that are plaguing the
companies in the current environment.

24
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,520
We'll also introduce a concept
of customer lifetime value here.

25
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,350
Next, we can explore the role of
mission learning and how we can leverage

26
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,369
it to solve some of the challenges
that the companies are facing today.

27
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:50,979
Following this, we can review the
optimal processes to convert some

28
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:54,759
of these mission learning concepts
into optimal business solutions.

29
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,850
Next, we can review a few real world
applications to see what kind of a

30
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,960
business impact can these mission learning
solutions drive for the companies?

31
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,169
And then we can take it home
with a few key takeaways.

32
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,720
Now let's jump in.

33
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,609
We all know that credit card is
a very powerful tool and very

34
00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:14,140
critical in our day-to-day lives.

35
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,280
We do not think twice before making
a purchase or a transaction with

36
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,660
without credit cards, but what actually
happens behind the scenes and what

37
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,250
happens from a company's perspective?

38
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,950
From a company's perspective, the
overall customer lifecycle can be broadly

39
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,050
divided into two distinctive phases.

40
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,450
The first one is acquisition.

41
00:02:34,095 --> 00:02:38,895
Which ends at the point of approval
or decline of a particular customer.

42
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:44,145
And the second phase is the customer
management, which starts with the point

43
00:02:44,145 --> 00:02:48,975
of approval of a particular customer
and goes all the way as long as the

44
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:50,595
customer stays with that company.

45
00:02:51,095 --> 00:02:55,775
In the first phase of acquisition,
we have a lot of activities starting

46
00:02:55,775 --> 00:03:00,155
with the marketing activity, which
targets a whole lot of customers.

47
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,220
With different marketing materials,
advertising the credit card product,

48
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,260
followed by the generous sign-on
bonuses that the companies give

49
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,920
out to attract customers when
they get approved for a card.

50
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,570
And then there is a whole lot of risk
strategies that evaluate whether a

51
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:22,850
customer is a good customer to be
approved by the company or a risky one.

52
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,910
And then there are some operational
processes which happen on the backend.

53
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,300
As a comp, as a customer
gets approved or declined.

54
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,790
As you can see in all these steps,
they are very cost intensive and they

55
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:41,340
require an upfront investment from the
company to acquire a particular customer.

56
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,400
This is typically called
the acquisition cost.

57
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,815
Then, when does a company make back money?

58
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,445
That is in the second phase
of customer management?

59
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:54,555
Once a customer starts using their card.

60
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:00,240
In making purchase transactions or
revolving by paying the interest

61
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,580
cash to the company on part of their
transaction volume, that is when the

62
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,230
company starts making back money.

63
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,420
In the second phase, the company
earns money, but also incurs some

64
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,860
losses in terms of some negative
behavior from the customers who do

65
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,370
not pay back the money that they owe
to the company, and they charge off.

66
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,080
So there is a potential for both making
money and losing money in the second

67
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,595
phase, but net, this is where the
customer lifetime value comes into effect.

68
00:04:28,095 --> 00:04:32,715
The upfront investment or the cost that
they make during the acquisition phase

69
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:37,695
and the net money that they either
make or lose in the second phase is

70
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:43,815
what makes up the total customer value
over the lifetime of the customer

71
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:45,710
being a member with the company.

72
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,760
And next, let's see why this
customer lifetime value matters.

73
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,100
As you can see, the first use case
is in the acquisition economics.

74
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,290
This is a place where a cus a company
has to decide whether they need to

75
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,450
approve a customer or decline them.

76
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,410
The cost of approving a wrong
customer is that they probably

77
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,495
would result in like heavier losses.

78
00:05:07,995 --> 00:05:10,725
Ultimately turning out to be
a net loss for the company

79
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:11,985
from a business perspective.

80
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:15,555
At the same time, the cost of losing
out a good customer is also pretty

81
00:05:15,555 --> 00:05:19,635
heavy, that they would leave money on
the table for competition and they would

82
00:05:19,635 --> 00:05:24,135
not be able to maximize the value that
they generate for the business and also

83
00:05:24,135 --> 00:05:25,365
that they generate for the customer.

84
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,935
So as you can see, there's a very
fine balance that happens between

85
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:31,575
approving a customer and declining them.

86
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:37,244
And all this is pursuant to what value
do we attribute from a customer lifetime

87
00:05:37,244 --> 00:05:41,984
value perspective to a particular segment
of customers or a particular customer,

88
00:05:42,314 --> 00:05:44,384
and what decision we make at that point.

89
00:05:44,884 --> 00:05:47,044
The second use case is in
the portfolio strategy.

90
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:51,484
Again, once a customer is approved by
a company, it doesn't mean that like

91
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,834
it's hunky and dory for everyone.

92
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:57,409
As you can see, as you can see from the
current environment, there are a lot of

93
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:59,239
changes that happen on a day-to-day basis.

94
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:03,679
Be it in the macro environment, or be
it in the co competitive actions, or be

95
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:09,139
it even in the customer's profile on how
they use their credit lines, not just with

96
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:13,399
this particular company, but with all the
other companies or like other forms of

97
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:19,159
loans that they take as things continue
to change on a very dynamic basis.

98
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:24,184
The company also has to make decisions
on a dynamic basis to make sure that

99
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:30,224
they're not overly exposed in the
case of eventful turns, or they are

100
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:35,444
not leaving money on the table by
not maximizing the customer's usage.

101
00:06:36,404 --> 00:06:40,844
So again, here, as you can see, the
customer lifetime value comes into

102
00:06:40,964 --> 00:06:44,414
play to make sure that the company
is making the right decision at the

103
00:06:44,414 --> 00:06:48,169
right time to ensure that like they're
maximizing the value for all the players.

104
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:51,969
The third point is in the p and
l forecasting, where we quantify

105
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:55,719
the expected revenues that we can
generate from a customer versus the

106
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:59,289
potential losses that can come from
any negative behavior from the customer

107
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:05,859
perspective, and combining those two
to make an informed decision at various

108
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:10,719
points of the customer lifecycle,
and making sure that the decision

109
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:14,649
is in the right sense for both the
customer and also for the company.

110
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:17,819
Now, let's see, like where
mission learning comes into play.

111
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:24,439
Historically, customer lifetime value,
or even the individual values for each

112
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:31,489
decision, were not driven by mission
learning or by multivariate enhances.

113
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:37,779
Things were mostly two dimensional, and
the effect of one variable was typically.

114
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:44,249
Analyzed in isolation and that led to
very skewed decisions, very dependent on

115
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:48,419
a few variables, while the majority of the
other variables which could potentially

116
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:51,389
Im impact the decision were neglected.

117
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,259
Now, this is where the mission
learning becomes a game changer

118
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:57,389
in the decision making process.

119
00:07:57,889 --> 00:07:59,959
Typically, the model.

120
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:05,839
Can analyze multivariate multiple
variables at the same time to come

121
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,879
up with a multivariate impact and
predict the outcome based on the

122
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,519
changes on simultaneous change in these
different variables at the same time.

123
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:22,639
So that's where instead of analyzing
like one particular variable in isolation

124
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,589
and then another variable in isolation,
the model helps combine the impact of

125
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:29,390
those two changes at the same time.

126
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:34,579
And predicting what could be the potential
outcome on the customer's behavior.

127
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:41,080
And these predictive models are very good
at taking in hundreds or thousands of

128
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,740
variables at the same time and deciding
on which are the top most variables and

129
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:50,120
which are the most impactful in terms
of predicting the customer behavior.

130
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,210
And then we can build a specific model.

131
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,240
To U utilize those variables.

132
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:02,260
So what are the main components within
the customer lifetime value modeling?

133
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,480
Can we use machine learning?

134
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,530
So the first one is the future spend
patterns as we were discussing.

135
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,770
Once a customer is approved.

136
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:18,590
The level to which they use the card is
one of the key components in deciding

137
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:22,940
on like when they, when the company
makes back money and breaks even on

138
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,100
that particular customer and the usage.

139
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:31,310
So as you can see, how much would
a customer potentially spend and

140
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,410
getting a good prediction on that will
determine how valuable the customer

141
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,440
is if in the at the point of approval.

142
00:09:40,175 --> 00:09:44,435
For a customer who spends like heavy
amounts, that is where like we, the

143
00:09:44,435 --> 00:09:48,245
company would make back a significant
amount of the overall purchase

144
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:52,775
volume in terms of the interchange
revenue, and that will help the

145
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:54,755
overall economics of the credit card.

146
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:58,105
The second outcome is
the revolving behavior.

147
00:09:58,705 --> 00:10:02,845
Once you make a purchase transaction,
the customer can elect to pay back it

148
00:10:02,845 --> 00:10:07,960
in full, which is typically called a
transacting behavior, or choose to evolve.

149
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,240
And pay an interest charge for
the flexibility to pay back the

150
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,330
purchase amount in installments.

151
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:21,910
So this is typically called a revolving
behavior or a revolver, and this

152
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:26,880
is where the company earns a higher
income based based on the interest

153
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,200
rate that they charge the customer.

154
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,210
So accurately predicting who would
who or like what kind of customers are

155
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,515
more likely to reward and like how much
of an amount that they would reward.

156
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:41,505
Would help in accurate planning of
like how much exposure should they

157
00:10:41,505 --> 00:10:45,855
maintain, how much reserves in capital
should they maintain, and also what

158
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:50,025
are the potential revenue streams that
they can expect from these customers.

159
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,865
The third one is in terms
of the payment reliability.

160
00:10:53,585 --> 00:10:56,440
Not everyone would have the same
efficiency to make back a payment.

161
00:10:57,155 --> 00:10:59,165
And or the willingness to make a payment.

162
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:03,335
So this is where like using machine
learning to predict, like the willingness

163
00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:07,385
of a customer to make a payment, their
ability to make a payment becomes

164
00:11:07,385 --> 00:11:11,675
critical in understanding what kind
of a customer behavior can they expect

165
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:17,605
if you if a customer doesn't have the
willingness or the ability to pay, they

166
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:21,865
are more likely to be a risky customer
and display negative delinquent behavior.

167
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:27,595
Which turns out to be a loss for the
company versus a customer who has

168
00:11:27,595 --> 00:11:32,005
got the means to pay back whatever
they're spending or chooses to spend

169
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:35,545
less than, like what they can pay
back are typically good behaviors.

170
00:11:35,935 --> 00:11:40,385
That would encourage in the
company also meeting out good

171
00:11:41,105 --> 00:11:42,185
treatments to the customer.

172
00:11:42,685 --> 00:11:44,185
The fourth and the.

173
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:49,515
Other cost component that we can
predict using this machine learning

174
00:11:49,515 --> 00:11:51,734
concepts is the default probability.

175
00:11:52,234 --> 00:11:55,685
This is the probability of a
customer actually going bad in the

176
00:11:55,685 --> 00:12:00,184
near future or in a slightly medium
term of say two to three years.

177
00:12:00,684 --> 00:12:06,114
So this is where this is the part
that helps the company to plan for

178
00:12:06,264 --> 00:12:11,944
any potential losses that can come
from these negative actions that

179
00:12:11,944 --> 00:12:13,175
they give out to the customers.

180
00:12:13,864 --> 00:12:17,284
In the spirit of not being too
conservative they have to be some

181
00:12:17,284 --> 00:12:21,214
decisions made by the company where they
give out like preferential treatment

182
00:12:21,214 --> 00:12:22,564
or like they approve customers.

183
00:12:23,114 --> 00:12:25,034
Knowing like what is the potential risk?

184
00:12:25,064 --> 00:12:28,794
So ultimately it boils down to the
risk reward for each customer segment.

185
00:12:29,634 --> 00:12:33,264
So even there, even though there would
not be any customer segments where

186
00:12:33,264 --> 00:12:34,974
there is like absolutely zero risk.

187
00:12:35,514 --> 00:12:39,954
So there is an accessable level of
risk that the customer needs to decide

188
00:12:39,954 --> 00:12:42,324
based on its internal tolerance levels.

189
00:12:42,354 --> 00:12:47,924
It's appetite for taking on risk and like
the required ratio of return that they

190
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:49,484
can generate on the capital employed.

191
00:12:50,174 --> 00:12:54,819
And then make an informed choice on the
relevant customer segments that they can

192
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:59,139
venture into versus like what customer
segments are absolutely out of reach

193
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,749
based on the absolute risk that they pose.

194
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:06,119
Now that we have looked at what outputs
can come from the machine learning models,

195
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:11,859
let's look at what actually goes into
determining these components or like

196
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:13,809
the outcomes that we just discussed.

197
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:18,689
Over here we see some of the primary
categories that we typically use.

198
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:22,400
The first one being on the
spending metrics which translate

199
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,960
into the spending volume.

200
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,940
How frequently they are spending,
are they using it like once a month

201
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,305
or are they using it like pretty
much like twice or twice a day?

202
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:34,900
What are the categories that the
customers are spending the money in?

203
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,940
Because there could be some categories.

204
00:13:37,345 --> 00:13:40,765
Which are like the daily things
like spending at grocery store,

205
00:13:40,765 --> 00:13:44,805
spending on gas, things like that
versus spending at a casino, which

206
00:13:44,805 --> 00:13:47,175
is typically a riskier transaction.

207
00:13:47,675 --> 00:13:49,385
The next is the payment behavior.

208
00:13:49,835 --> 00:13:51,665
How many times is the
customer paying back?

209
00:13:51,725 --> 00:13:54,695
Are they paying back in full or
are they making partial payments

210
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:56,555
and multiple payments a month?

211
00:13:57,095 --> 00:14:00,185
And this could potentially imply.

212
00:14:00,585 --> 00:14:05,725
How the customer's cash flow is and
what kind of a risk do they pose?

213
00:14:06,085 --> 00:14:09,835
If the customers are making full payments,
like early on, then that is typically a

214
00:14:09,835 --> 00:14:14,925
good behavior versus if someone's making
almost towards the end of the payment

215
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:18,824
due date, and if they're making multiple
payments in partial amounts through

216
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:22,484
different sources, that's probably an
impending cash flow issue that could

217
00:14:22,484 --> 00:14:24,525
potentially arise from the customer.

218
00:14:25,025 --> 00:14:28,665
Balance utilization is the
concept where it is more prominent

219
00:14:28,665 --> 00:14:30,105
for the revolving customers.

220
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:33,255
What kind of balance
do the customers carry?

221
00:14:33,435 --> 00:14:35,295
How much of a credit line are they using?

222
00:14:35,295 --> 00:14:38,505
Are they using up all the credit
line, which is typically a risky

223
00:14:38,505 --> 00:14:43,065
behavior versus if they are maintaining
the utilization in a good range,

224
00:14:43,065 --> 00:14:44,835
which is typically below 30%.

225
00:14:45,335 --> 00:14:48,155
Some of the external signals
that we can also feed in are

226
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:49,530
typically the income proxies.

227
00:14:50,245 --> 00:14:54,655
Which are modeled income, and that
also feeds back into understanding like

228
00:14:54,655 --> 00:14:58,105
what is the ability for the customer
to pay back some of their balances.

229
00:14:58,545 --> 00:15:02,265
And some of the credit bureau attributes,
which talk about not just the credit

230
00:15:02,265 --> 00:15:06,835
lines with the current company, but also
with the other external competitors and

231
00:15:06,835 --> 00:15:11,595
also the other types of loans that the
customers can potentially have now that we

232
00:15:11,595 --> 00:15:13,185
have seen like some of these categories.

233
00:15:13,685 --> 00:15:18,665
We understand that like we have a lot
of data that we can use to model these

234
00:15:18,665 --> 00:15:21,455
in birds, but that's not just enough.

235
00:15:21,815 --> 00:15:25,475
So once we identify these different
categories or like the different variables

236
00:15:25,475 --> 00:15:29,435
that we want to feed into the model,
which typically form the raw transactions,

237
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:34,805
then we need to aggregate all these and
enrich the data to make sure that it is

238
00:15:34,805 --> 00:15:37,475
in a easy to digest form for the model.

239
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:41,245
Having a lot of missing
values or having a lot of.

240
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:46,360
Extreme values for a particular variable
could skew the model, and that is

241
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,960
what we need to avoid to ensure that
we get a good output from the model.

242
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:53,710
It is just like adage goes
garbage in, garbage out.

243
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,790
If you feed in like garbage random
data, we do not expect to get

244
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,050
a good output from the model.

245
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:05,130
Once we feed in this clean out data
to the model, it employs different

246
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,265
we employ different techniques,
which we review on the next slide.

247
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:13,270
We can identify different behavioral
patterns from these models and I, and

248
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,659
assign a cause effect relationship.

249
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:22,430
And use, use this linkage to identify
like what patterns within these

250
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:28,609
transactions or the patterns by the
customer would typically lead to the

251
00:16:28,609 --> 00:16:30,109
different outcomes that we discussed.

252
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,890
Be in terms of in terms of the
probability of a default or their

253
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:39,120
willingness to pay, or like their
probability of carrying a balance and

254
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,950
how much balance would they carry.

255
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:46,820
So all these different parameters can be
predicted once a model, a senses, cost

256
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,620
of effect, linkage, and identifies these
patterns to predict the outcome behavior.

257
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,900
Now as we are discussing, there is this
intermediate component of what is that?

258
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:00,030
Machine learning approach that
we can use to help the model

259
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,980
assign these different linkages.

260
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:06,240
And here we have three different
approaches, which are primarily

261
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,040
used in most of the use cases.

262
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,710
And the first one is the
gradient boosting model.

263
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:16,290
The XG boost or the light GBM
are typically the widely adopted.

264
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,030
Methodologies within the
financial industry and they help

265
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:24,480
predict pretty much like all the
outcomes that we were discussing.

266
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,710
A couple of other models are are the
approaches, are the deep learning

267
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:33,690
methodology, which typically uses
neural networks and recurrent

268
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:39,640
networks and transformations to
predict sequence behaviors, and can

269
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,600
be used for dynamic predictions.

270
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,000
The third component.

271
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:46,090
The third most used approach is the
survival models which uses different

272
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:52,990
parameters to predict the time to event,
and is predominantly used for metrics

273
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,425
like attrition and retention models.

274
00:17:55,925 --> 00:18:00,145
Now that we have reviewed the different
approaches that we can employ.

275
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:05,700
To generate predictive outcomes and the
way we can actually use the different

276
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:10,200
inputs and the different variables that
can be fed into it, how do we ensure

277
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,270
that like the model that is being
finalized or that is being used or would

278
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:21,170
potentially be used in the business use
cases be up to the market standards or be

279
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,870
satisfactory and not have any bias in it?

280
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,970
So the first thing that we need
to ensure is to make sure that we.

281
00:18:28,495 --> 00:18:34,195
Use a temporal validation methodology,
which is to train the model on a

282
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:39,355
different time period and validate the
model using a different time period.

283
00:18:40,165 --> 00:18:43,495
So if you have say, three years worth
of historical data that we can train

284
00:18:43,495 --> 00:18:47,725
the model on instead of using all
the three years and then validating

285
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:52,195
the model again within a part of
those three years will likely lead

286
00:18:52,195 --> 00:18:54,595
to overfitting bias instead of that.

287
00:18:55,095 --> 00:18:59,445
We need to use probably two years for
training the model and then like we

288
00:18:59,445 --> 00:19:03,675
validated the model on the remaining
one year to ensure that like the model

289
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:09,045
continues to perform equally well in
both the time periods and it is not over

290
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:11,875
fitting to fit only the training period.

291
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,810
And the next component
is a segment analysis.

292
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:19,665
What kind of, or what's the
composition of the input data?

293
00:19:20,485 --> 00:19:25,435
Is very critical in deciding on
if the model output can be used

294
00:19:25,735 --> 00:19:27,145
across different segments or not.

295
00:19:27,645 --> 00:19:31,635
For example, let's take like the
transac and revolver behaviors, right?

296
00:19:31,915 --> 00:19:36,685
So if you develop a model completely
depending on the transac population

297
00:19:36,685 --> 00:19:42,565
itself, and feed that as a input,
the model designs itself to predict

298
00:19:42,565 --> 00:19:46,465
the transac kind of a behavior,
and that's where the output also

299
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:47,725
would be in the similar way.

300
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,440
But if we continue to use that model or
start or use that model for predicting

301
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,330
the revolver behavior, that's where the
output though we might get some output, it

302
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,370
would be way off from the actual behavior.

303
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:07,120
So the way or the segments that we use
the model in is very critical and we

304
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,650
need to make sure that like the use
case, the business use case that we

305
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:15,810
are employing has a composition of the
customers, which is very similar to.

306
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,320
What the model development
sample looks like.

307
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,430
A couple of other columns that we need
to do is like whenever we roll out the

308
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:29,860
model, it is always a good practice to
have a test control a setup where we

309
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,910
test the model output and the decisions
based on the model output in the test

310
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,760
population, and then hold the control to.

311
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,600
Continue the decision making process
in the traditional approach way before

312
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:47,390
we confirm that the model is driving
incremental value and employ the

313
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,670
model output for a broader use case.

314
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:55,500
And the second one is a continuous
evaluation to determine the stability

315
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:57,325
of the model as we are discussing.

316
00:20:58,005 --> 00:21:01,845
Change is only constant, so the
macro environment could change or the

317
00:21:01,935 --> 00:21:04,815
potential customer behaviors can change.

318
00:21:05,175 --> 00:21:09,765
So we need to continuously evaluate on
a regular basis, preferably quarterly,

319
00:21:10,155 --> 00:21:13,875
to make sure that the model output
continues to perform in a stable

320
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,125
manner for the current population.

321
00:21:16,695 --> 00:21:18,675
If we observe any deviations
over there, that is when like.

322
00:21:19,175 --> 00:21:23,945
We need to refit the model based on an
updated sample to make sure that the more

323
00:21:23,945 --> 00:21:28,115
recent model or the more recent customer
behaviors are being captured by the

324
00:21:28,115 --> 00:21:33,655
model and the output is being accordingly
tailored to accommodate these updates.

325
00:21:34,155 --> 00:21:38,505
One component that we need to
evaluate again is the stress

326
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,095
part, the stress testing part.

327
00:21:40,935 --> 00:21:45,325
So in a normal environment
the model output continues to.

328
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,370
Be as easily applicable in
our decision making process.

329
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:53,720
But there are some scenarios,
especially in economic downturns, which

330
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,520
proudly impact the overall industry.

331
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,730
We need to evaluate by placing
an additional stress on the model

332
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:02,455
output to see what kind of a
decision it generally leads to.

333
00:22:03,205 --> 00:22:06,745
And the general norm within the
industry has been to employ a

334
00:22:06,745 --> 00:22:09,625
factor typically to estimate.

335
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:15,370
The additional stress that we need to
take on in times of like broader economic

336
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:19,840
stress and evaluate if we continue to be
profitable in those kind of scenarios.

337
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:24,550
And this stress test typically helps
determine like if the model can continue

338
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:28,360
to be used or if it practically wipes
out the entire population from being

339
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,840
targeted, then that is when like we
probably need a more stringent model

340
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,570
to account for these stressful times.

341
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:38,880
Now that we have seen like the entire
model development journey and the

342
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,620
application of how it can be leveraged and
like how we can validate it, let's review

343
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,050
a couple of the real world applications.

344
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:51,930
And as we were saying earlier, the real
world applications can come across like

345
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:57,840
the entire customer lifecycle because
they play a role in determining the

346
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,705
value of a customer that the company can.

347
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,610
Take on at different phases.

348
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:07,280
So the first uses that we will evaluate
is related to the acquisition phase.

349
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:11,810
So how can the mission learning
based customer lifetime value help

350
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:16,900
us determine whether we can how we
can optimize the acquisition outcome.

351
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,250
So depending on the customer
lifetime value, if you identify

352
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,730
a segment of customers who
typically tend to be high spenders.

353
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:29,250
Or who typically tend to be like
revolving on like significant amounts

354
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:34,580
of the purchases that they make, then
we can expect that gradually over a

355
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,330
period of time, the money that you
make from, or the revenue that we can

356
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:43,160
generate from the usage patterns of these
customers would be typically very high.

357
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:48,710
In order to attract these customers
and have them open a card with

358
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,940
us, we can potentially afford to
give them higher sign-on bonuses.

359
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,460
And target them in a more aggressive
fashion so that we can generate a

360
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,630
better response rate and also have
higher volume of customers coming in.

361
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,010
So that's where like the segment
targeting can benefit heavily based on

362
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,110
the accurate customer lifetime value.

363
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,790
For the credit card.

364
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,275
The same goes to the credit policy tuning.

365
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:16,410
So we know that like we probably
identify a group of customers that

366
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,020
we can identify that we can approve.

367
00:24:18,605 --> 00:24:22,505
But should we always be satisfied
with just that segment of customers?

368
00:24:22,835 --> 00:24:27,965
Can't we actually go beyond and test
for some of these borderline cases?

369
00:24:28,145 --> 00:24:33,485
Because for all that we know, the
model predicts based on the behavior

370
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:37,245
based on the, based on what it has
learned from the historical behavior.

371
00:24:37,965 --> 00:24:41,115
What if some of the assumptions
that we make for these borderline

372
00:24:41,115 --> 00:24:43,965
customers are not validated?

373
00:24:44,655 --> 00:24:47,355
And is there a merit in actually
approving these customers?

374
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:53,280
So instead of approving like a whole
lot of like unapproachable population,

375
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:57,360
we can identify like those borderline
cases and the marginal segments that we

376
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,310
can potentially ident approve and try
to learn their behaviors and validate

377
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,570
the assumptions that we are making.

378
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,310
This also becomes important in
targeting some of the segments or like

379
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,030
launching new products that we have
that we don't have any history on, and

380
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:16,095
we just use some proxy to understand
or to get a baseline as a mission.

381
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:21,820
And going into this policy tuning
based on this machine learning will

382
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:28,590
help us I optimize for those policy
gaps and the maximum identifying

383
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,530
those maximum boundaries that we
can approve the population into.

384
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,320
Okay.

385
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:37,445
Now let's evaluate another use case, which
is more in the customer management phase.

386
00:25:37,945 --> 00:25:42,275
So once a customer starts spending
with us, we probably originate

387
00:25:42,275 --> 00:25:46,445
them or acquire them with say
average line of say, $20,000.

388
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:52,165
But depending on the customer behavior,
that $20,000 may not be sufficient

389
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:55,315
because they continue to spend a
whole lot and like they are either

390
00:25:55,315 --> 00:25:58,905
making like multiple payments within
the month to make sure that they open

391
00:25:58,905 --> 00:26:01,515
up their line and continue to spend.

392
00:26:02,175 --> 00:26:04,695
So in a way, like we are causing
a friction at that point.

393
00:26:05,055 --> 00:26:09,775
And eventually, like if the customer gets
a higher line or a better experience with

394
00:26:09,775 --> 00:26:13,475
any of our competitors, they would tend to
migrate away from using our card at that

395
00:26:13,475 --> 00:26:16,295
point to avoid those kind of scenarios.

396
00:26:16,805 --> 00:26:22,075
And if you are able to capture or use
this machine learning models to accurately

397
00:26:22,075 --> 00:26:24,895
identify the true need of the customer.

398
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:29,770
Then we can give them a much higher line
than the initial line that we gave them

399
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,330
and continue to build on the engagement
that the customer is displaying.

400
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,300
The similar goes other way as well.

401
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,320
We started off a customer with say,
a $20,000 line and for some reason we

402
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,615
observe like negative behavior or like
a signs of negative behavior from the

403
00:26:45,615 --> 00:26:50,685
customer in terms of them becoming
riskier in servicing their loans.

404
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:55,140
Or having transactions which probably
indicate that they are turning out

405
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,920
to be risky, like spending in risky
categories or not being able to make

406
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:03,395
their full payment over time or like
struggling to to make payments because

407
00:27:03,395 --> 00:27:05,585
of return payments, things like that.

408
00:27:06,095 --> 00:27:10,865
In that case, should we still like
open ourselves to that entire $20,000

409
00:27:10,865 --> 00:27:12,185
line that we gave to the customer?

410
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:17,210
We do have the option of proactively
reducing the line to make sure that like

411
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:23,810
we do not expose the business to heavy
losses and restrict our loss potential in

412
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,820
by which we would be saving on the costs.

413
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,335
So in such a fashion, we can
dynamically manage our exposure.

414
00:27:31,075 --> 00:27:34,345
To maximize the value that we
generate for the customer and also

415
00:27:34,345 --> 00:27:38,205
the potential business value that we
get out from these customer behaviors.

416
00:27:38,705 --> 00:27:42,095
In addition to these, we also
have like multiple retention

417
00:27:42,095 --> 00:27:45,605
strategies or like the fee waivers
that we give out to the customers.

418
00:27:45,845 --> 00:27:51,145
Any reward one-time reward categories or
what accelerators that we give out based

419
00:27:51,145 --> 00:27:55,675
on the overall value that the customer has
generated till now and could potentially

420
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:57,205
generate based on their behavior.

421
00:27:57,595 --> 00:28:01,945
And we can give a very good experience
or a rewarding experience to the customer

422
00:28:01,945 --> 00:28:05,425
back and make sure that like we continue
to develop that engagement with them.

423
00:28:05,925 --> 00:28:09,135
Now that we have seen a couple of
real world applications, let's see,

424
00:28:09,135 --> 00:28:12,885
like how we can actually measure the
profitability or the measure, the

425
00:28:12,885 --> 00:28:14,355
improvement that these machine learning.

426
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:19,730
Solutions are actually helping us generate
as we are discussing in the acquisition,

427
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:25,160
if you target the right customer and we
know that or we have a good, accurate

428
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,880
assessment of what kind of spend and
like the balances that they can carry or

429
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,670
that they use in the future, we would be
able to accelerate the breakeven period.

430
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,795
So as I was saying, like four
to six years is the average.

431
00:28:37,595 --> 00:28:40,925
But if you can identify the group of
customers who actually spend a lot with

432
00:28:40,925 --> 00:28:44,315
us or who actually revolve a lot with
us, we could potentially achieve that

433
00:28:44,315 --> 00:28:46,115
break even in less than four years.

434
00:28:47,045 --> 00:28:50,075
So those are the kind of customers
that we want to essentially target and

435
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:54,805
and spend more on getting those kind
of customers versus still sticking to

436
00:28:54,835 --> 00:28:59,455
the traditional approaches and making
terms on having that average break

437
00:28:59,455 --> 00:29:00,925
given period of four to six years.

438
00:29:01,015 --> 00:29:06,785
Yeah, not just that say the balance is
written is where if you know for sure,

439
00:29:06,785 --> 00:29:10,775
like what is the kind of losses that
we can expect from a set of customers

440
00:29:10,985 --> 00:29:15,565
versus what is the potential benefit
we can make an appropriate risk reward

441
00:29:15,565 --> 00:29:22,585
decision to make sure that we chase higher
returns with acceptable risk instead of

442
00:29:22,585 --> 00:29:27,100
being very conservative and going for
lower returns to maintain the risk flow.

443
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,170
So using machine learning models, we
can have a better accu and accurate

444
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,880
assessment of what that risk reward
ratio would look like for a segment of

445
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:41,400
customers and optimize like a targeting
strategy and be very aggressive in

446
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,060
changing some group of customers versus
being conservative in moving out of

447
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:50,010
some pockets, which may seem like low
risk based on the traditional data,

448
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,810
but they could just be a ticking timer.

449
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:56,180
In the same way not just from the
business decisions perspective.

450
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:00,950
We can also use these assessments
that we get using the machine learning

451
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:06,440
models to have the right optimized
allocation of resources, be it in terms

452
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:12,710
of the human resources or like the
marketing budgets that we can have or

453
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:16,830
the operational budgets that we need
to have to service these customers.

454
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:22,480
We can focus on what would be the
optimal allocation and essentially

455
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,730
assign more resources to target high
customer lifetime value customers

456
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:34,060
versus having a equal approach or equal
allocation to all different segments.

457
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,860
Now that we have reviewed so much
information let's, let me wrap up and,

458
00:30:38,915 --> 00:30:43,485
provide four main key takeaways that
we have from this discussion so far.

459
00:30:44,145 --> 00:30:49,605
The first one and the core concept is the
customer lifetime value and how central

460
00:30:49,605 --> 00:30:51,585
it is to the credit card profitability.

461
00:30:52,085 --> 00:30:56,435
Starting from the upfront acquisition
cost, all the way through a dynamic

462
00:30:56,525 --> 00:31:01,865
customer management phase, that having
an accurate assessment of the overall

463
00:31:01,865 --> 00:31:06,275
customer lifetime value and constantly
adjusting it to the ever changing.

464
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:12,620
Factors is a key input into how, or what
kind of decisions we make and what kind of

465
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,630
treatments we give out to these customers.

466
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:22,120
And this is the most important concept of
optimizing the profitability so that we

467
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:27,730
can continue to have a dynamic allocation
of resources and make sure that.

468
00:31:28,435 --> 00:31:33,055
We are, we maximize the value
for both the company and also

469
00:31:33,055 --> 00:31:34,705
the customer at the same time.

470
00:31:35,205 --> 00:31:38,265
The second one is how mission
learning can actually help us

471
00:31:38,445 --> 00:31:44,715
unlock some of the predictions that
the traditional ma univa kind of

472
00:31:44,715 --> 00:31:47,625
models or analysis wouldn't help us.

473
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:53,145
Behavioral modeling and using machine
learning concepts can help us.

474
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:56,340
Understand the impact of like
multiple variables and multiple

475
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,130
factors on the customer behavior.

476
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,930
And it provides us like multiple
viewers that we can leverage to impact

477
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:08,100
the customer actions and how we can
build a deeper engagement with them.

478
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,970
And as we have seen, the applications
of these machine learning solutions can

479
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:19,190
span across the entire customer lifecycle
starting from the time of acquisition and.

480
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,960
Going all the way through the
retention phase, the customer

481
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,460
management phase, and how they can
actually play together to inform the

482
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,620
overall profit and loss statement.

483
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,989
One word of caution, I would still like
to call out is the rigorous validation

484
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:37,960
as I was saying, building a model.

485
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:44,310
Is fine, but making sure that the business
case stays true and we are taking an

486
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:49,680
unbiased approach along with the rigorous
validation periodically to make sure

487
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:53,940
that the model is still relevant to the
current times is of utmost importance.

488
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,610
If you continue to operate on a model that
doesn't make any more sense based on the

489
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:04,549
customer behaviors or the changed external
environment, we would be making like

490
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,009
very wrong decisions for the business.

491
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:13,400
And that is a huge cost to the business
which we will realize very late and

492
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:18,920
would take a lot of impact to both the
brand and also the customer experience.

493
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:25,179
With that said, thanks a lot for
your engagement and I request you to

494
00:33:25,449 --> 00:33:29,560
please reach out to me on LinkedIn
and I will be very happy to connect

495
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,225
with you and discuss more about.

496
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:36,039
The machine learning applications and the
overall credit card industry in general.

497
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:37,229
Have a good one.

498
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:37,499
Bye.
