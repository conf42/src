1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,830
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,640
I'm Shashank Reddy Pirevelli, currently
working in Walmart as a software engineer.

3
00:00:05,369 --> 00:00:08,520
I'm excited to be here to explore
a topic that has a tremendous value

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,059
for business across industries.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,369
How AI improves data quality
for better business insights.

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,029
In today's data driven world, accurate
and reliable data is the backbone

7
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:19,199
of any successful business decision.

8
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:23,579
However, as we know, data is often
unstructured, incomplete, or inaccurate.

9
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:28,179
These data quality issues can result
in poor decision making, missed

10
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:30,119
opportunities, and inefficiencies.

11
00:00:30,819 --> 00:00:33,779
In this session, we will explore
how artificial intelligence is

12
00:00:33,819 --> 00:00:37,729
transforming data quality management
by offering advanced solutions.

13
00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:41,729
We will also dive into real world
challenges as well as how AI

14
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:45,429
approaches in sectors like financial
services and manufacturing.

15
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:49,049
Today, we are facing a number of
challenges across data quality.

16
00:00:49,294 --> 00:00:51,364
Let me highlight a few key issues.

17
00:00:52,114 --> 00:00:55,574
Data team often spend about 40
percent of their time dealing with

18
00:00:55,574 --> 00:01:00,324
quality issues, which can consume up
to 25 percent of operation budget.

19
00:01:00,404 --> 00:01:02,884
This result in substantial
loss of productivity.

20
00:01:03,714 --> 00:01:06,034
Next, we have the issue
of critical data gaps.

21
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:10,959
Many enterprise systems functions
at only 75 80 percent completeness,

22
00:01:11,559 --> 00:01:15,139
leaving important insights hidden
due to missing or incomplete data.

23
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:18,679
Another challenge is the
issue with duplicate records.

24
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:23,029
Around 25 30 percent of customer and
vendor record contain duplicates,

25
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:27,819
resulting in waste resources and leading
to inconsistent customer interaction.

26
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,299
Lastly, corporate data become outdated
at a rate of approximately 23 percent per

27
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,849
year and B2B data is even more volatile,
degrading by 36 percent annually.

28
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:43,639
This rapid rate of data decay makes
it increasing difficult to rely on

29
00:01:43,989 --> 00:01:46,239
information for accurate decision making.

30
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:50,689
These challenges not only affect
productivity, but also hinder overall

31
00:01:50,699 --> 00:01:52,189
business performance and growth.

32
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:56,629
Now let's talk about how AI
power solutions are transforming

33
00:01:56,629 --> 00:01:57,899
data quality management.

34
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,709
With advanced AI algorithms,
we can automatically detect

35
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:03,289
and fix data inconsistencies.

36
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:08,684
This reduces error rate by an impressive
67 percent and process data 50 times

37
00:02:08,684 --> 00:02:10,874
faster than the traditional methods.

38
00:02:11,514 --> 00:02:15,314
Moreover, natural language processing
models are now being used to

39
00:02:15,314 --> 00:02:19,804
standardize data across multiple
languages, achieving 94 percent

40
00:02:19,804 --> 00:02:24,614
accuracy and ensuring consistent
data quality and on a global scale.

41
00:02:25,114 --> 00:02:28,689
Additionally, using advanced
machine learning models, AI can

42
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:32,769
intelligently fill data gap with
91 percent accuracy, eliminating

43
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:34,659
the need for manual data entry.

44
00:02:35,249 --> 00:02:39,759
In real time, AI validation system
can process up to 850k records per

45
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,409
minute, maintaining an impressive 99.

46
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:44,617
5 percent accuracy.

47
00:02:44,617 --> 00:02:47,284
This ensures errors are detected and
corrected before, after, and after.

48
00:02:47,564 --> 00:02:49,444
The impact critical business decisions.

49
00:02:50,174 --> 00:02:54,784
These AI solutions are drastically
improving both the speed and accurate

50
00:02:54,784 --> 00:03:01,024
of data management, making it easier to
ensure high quality data across the board.

51
00:03:01,524 --> 00:03:05,865
Let's now look at the impact of AI
powered solutions in financial services.

52
00:03:06,674 --> 00:03:08,404
Thanks to machine learning algorithms.

53
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:13,219
We can accelerate transaction validation
and fraud detection by 250 times.

54
00:03:13,749 --> 00:03:17,559
This significantly speeds up the
processing and validation of transactions,

55
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:22,009
allowing business to respond to potential
issues much faster and more effectively.

56
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:25,089
Next, we observe 35
percent reduction in cost.

57
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:29,349
By leveraging smart automation and
predictive maintenance, operational

58
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:31,379
expenses are cut down by 35%.

59
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:34,499
At the same time, service
quality is enhanced.

60
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:37,989
resulting in more efficient
and cost effective operation.

61
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:41,139
Then there is a 92 percent
reduction in errors.

62
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:46,674
Advanced pattern recognition significantly
reduces complaints related data error

63
00:03:46,864 --> 00:03:52,514
by 92 percent, minimizing the risk of
cost, regulatory mistakes, and penalties.

64
00:03:53,014 --> 00:03:54,165
Lastly, we save 6.

65
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:54,905
6 percent of time.

66
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:58,704
Automated data collection
and validation process reduce

67
00:03:58,764 --> 00:04:00,444
regulatory report time by 6.

68
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:05,395
6 percent, allowing staff to focus more
on strategic tasks and significantly

69
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:06,655
boosting overall productivity.

70
00:04:07,155 --> 00:04:10,405

00:04:22,024 --> 00:04:25,564
AI powered validation systems
continuously monitor production data

76
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:29,834
in real time, catching defects before
they can impact product quality.

77
00:04:30,224 --> 00:04:31,588
This ensures we maintain a 99.

78
00:04:31,588 --> 00:04:32,362
7 percent accuracy rate.

79
00:04:32,362 --> 00:04:33,329
