A key JavaScript concept.

83
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:55,429
Variable and function, DOM manipulation,
asynchronous programming, event handling.

84
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,989
Let's talk a little bit more.

85
00:05:58,489 --> 00:06:02,049
Variables stores data value in JavaScript.

86
00:06:02,549 --> 00:06:04,409
You can declare variables using.

87
00:06:05,384 --> 00:06:08,854
where let or const depend on the use case.

88
00:06:09,354 --> 00:06:14,054
Let and const are block scoped,
while where is function scoped.

89
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:18,914
Functions are blocks of code
designed to perform specific tasks.

90
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:22,864
You can pass data to functions
and return values from them.

91
00:06:23,364 --> 00:06:27,954
Function allows you to reuse the code
and keep your applications organized.

92
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:34,794
DOM The document object model represents
the HTML structure of a web page.

93
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:40,834
JavaScript can modify DOM to update
the content dynamically without

94
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,154
needing to reload the entire page.

95
00:06:42,654 --> 00:06:47,144
Asynchronous programming promises
and async await are used to handle

96
00:06:47,144 --> 00:06:52,514
asynchronous operations like fetch data
from API without blocking the main thread.

97
00:06:53,014 --> 00:06:56,814
Using async await makes
the code more readable.

98
00:06:57,314 --> 00:07:03,408
This code awaits for API call to
complete and then process the data.

99
00:07:03,408 --> 00:07:04,574
Event handling.

100
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:09,974
JavaScript can handle various events
triggered by users such as clicking

101
00:07:09,974 --> 00:07:16,044
the buttons, submitting forms, Or
pressing on any keys, you can attach

102
00:07:16,054 --> 00:07:21,744
event listeners to elements to
perform actions when an event occurs.

103
00:07:22,554 --> 00:07:24,784
These are the fundamental concepts.

104
00:07:25,544 --> 00:07:30,214
to build interactive and dynamic
web applications in JavaScript.

105
00:07:30,714 --> 00:07:36,924
Interact, integrate, integration
of SAP HR with SAPUI5 and Java.

106
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:43,104
Java for back end logic, SAPUI5 for
front end, role of OData services.

107
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:47,041
Java is responsible for
managing business logic, data

108
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,568
processing and back end services.

109
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:50,074
SAPUI5?

110
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:55,744
SAP OFI creates a front end user
experience and JavaScript handles

111
00:07:55,744 --> 00:07:57,144
the real time interactions.

112
00:07:58,104 --> 00:08:01,384
OData services facilitates the
communication between SAP HR and

113
00:08:01,384 --> 00:08:06,664
SAP OFI by allowing the real time
data exchange, like retrieving

114
00:08:06,914 --> 00:08:08,959
and updating the employee's data.

115
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,104
JavaScript, real time data updates.

116
00:08:12,604 --> 00:08:17,224
Using Ajax and Ajax is a technique
that allows the web application to

117
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:22,700
update the part of pages dynamically
without requiring a full reload.

118
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:28,654
It is commonly used to make web pages
feel more responsive and interactive,

119
00:08:28,694 --> 00:08:31,054
especially for a real time data updates.

120
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:32,664
Client side request.

121
00:08:32,774 --> 00:08:37,194
So when a user performs an action
like clicking a button or submitting

122
00:08:37,194 --> 00:08:40,764
a form, JavaScript sends and
ejects request to the server.

123
00:08:41,264 --> 00:08:42,154
Asynchronous process.

124
00:08:43,094 --> 00:08:48,233
The page doesn't, so in asynchronous
process, the page doesn't need to refresh.

125
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:50,764
Instead, JavaScript handles
the request in the background.

126
00:08:51,454 --> 00:08:52,734
Server side response.

127
00:08:53,254 --> 00:08:58,614
So the server side response, the request
and, Server, the server process the

128
00:08:58,624 --> 00:09:03,974
request and returns the data often in
the form of JSON or XML, the JavaScript

129
00:09:03,974 --> 00:09:09,324
on the client side return process the
return data and updates a part of web

130
00:09:09,324 --> 00:09:15,184
pages without reloading the entire page
promises async await handling asynchronous

131
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:20,704
data flow between the front end on
the back end here between the SAPUI5

132
00:09:20,704 --> 00:09:24,834
and Java is very crucial to create a
responsive and smooth user experience.

133
00:09:25,654 --> 00:09:30,174
Asynchronous communication ensures
that the UI remains interactive while

134
00:09:30,174 --> 00:09:34,674
in the background in the back end
process requests and sends the response.

135
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:38,434
This approach prevents the UI
from freezing during the long

136
00:09:38,434 --> 00:09:42,664
running operations, enhancing the
overall performance of web pages.

137
00:09:43,164 --> 00:09:48,864
Asynchronous programming executes the
code that doesn't block further execution.

138
00:09:48,874 --> 00:09:51,073
The system continues running
while the UI is active.

139
00:09:51,344 --> 00:09:56,094
The other task waiting for the
data to be fetched or processed.
