00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,220
Hi, this is Sandeep Dhargula.

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,479
I'm a senior software engineer
and welcoming you all who

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,050
have joined in CONF42, CloneA2
2025 conference on my talk.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,990
And here I'm going to present my
topic on AI driven fraud detection.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,779
And I'm going to explain how AI
is transferring the way financial

6
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:20,500
institutions prevent fraud and
financial crime by leveraging predictive

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,880
analytics and behavior based model.

8
00:00:22,259 --> 00:00:25,669
And AI is set to
revolutionizing financial fraud.

9
00:00:26,205 --> 00:00:26,745
detection.

10
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:30,685
So this fraud detection
market is projected to surplus

11
00:00:30,685 --> 00:00:33,065
dollar 190 billion by 2030.

12
00:00:33,065 --> 00:00:34,214
It's a big, huge number.

13
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:38,075
And by the end of this section,
everyone will get all the info how AI

14
00:00:38,075 --> 00:00:42,335
is driving significant reduction in
financial losses and inefficiencies.

15
00:00:42,795 --> 00:00:45,155
Let's dive into predictive analytics.

16
00:00:45,655 --> 00:00:50,199
in predictive analytics, AI algorithm
analyze billions of transactions

17
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:53,570
daily to identify fraud patterns
with unparalleled accuracy.

18
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,169
These advanced models can achieve
detection rates as high as 90%.

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,929
The processing transactions
in milliseconds.

20
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:04,599
So this improvement drastically
reduces false alerts and

21
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,190
enhances operation efficiency
compared to traditional systems.

22
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:13,350
And real time insights, AI
continuously adapts by learning

23
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,789
from new fraud patterns.

24
00:01:15,145 --> 00:01:18,935
So keeping financial institutions
based ahead of emerging threats.

25
00:01:19,294 --> 00:01:23,955
This dynamic learning capabilities
allows organizations to remain

26
00:01:23,955 --> 00:01:25,645
compliant with regulatory standards.

27
00:01:26,455 --> 00:01:31,765
by affecting combating evolving fraud
tactics and reduced false positives.

28
00:01:31,955 --> 00:01:36,134
Unlike traditional system, which
can generate up to 50 percent false

29
00:01:36,134 --> 00:01:41,114
positives, AI powered fraud detection
reduces false positives to under 10%.

30
00:01:41,765 --> 00:01:46,004
So this precision enables security
teams to focus on genuine threats,

31
00:01:46,194 --> 00:01:49,804
streamlining investigations and
enhancing customers satisfactions.

32
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:52,374
Let's drive into behavior based models.

33
00:01:52,874 --> 00:01:57,424
Here in the behavior based model,
AI tracks and analyzes user behavior

34
00:01:57,434 --> 00:02:00,354
in real time, processing thousands
of transactions per second.

35
00:02:00,714 --> 00:02:05,164
By comparing current activity against
historical profiles, AI can quickly flag

36
00:02:05,214 --> 00:02:09,744
anomalies like unusual international
wide transfer, changes in transaction

37
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:14,134
location, or abnormal purchasing
pattern across multiple platforms.

38
00:02:14,454 --> 00:02:17,584
So here, the product to fraud prevention.

39
00:02:17,934 --> 00:02:22,004
So AI systems are designed to identify
and address suspicious behavior

40
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:24,194
pattern before fraud escalates.

41
00:02:24,514 --> 00:02:29,594
Since over 60 percent of fraud originates
from irregular behavior, early detection

42
00:02:29,594 --> 00:02:33,784
is crucial in reducing financial
losses and maintaining customer trust.

43
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:37,754
So in significant loss reduction,
so financial institutions that

44
00:02:37,774 --> 00:02:42,664
implements AI driven behavior
monitoring have seen up to 40 percent

45
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:44,654
reduction in fraud reduction losses.

46
00:02:44,944 --> 00:02:49,314
So in sectors like such as Banking
and e commerce these transactions

47
00:02:49,314 --> 00:02:53,124
in into millions of dollars saved
revenue So while improving the customer

48
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:54,824
experience by minimizing false alert

49
00:02:55,324 --> 00:03:00,114
And financial gains like using AI,
financial institutions like JP Morgan,

50
00:03:00,124 --> 00:03:05,254
MasterCard and Goldman Sachs are deployed
sophisticated AI system to revolutionizing

51
00:03:05,284 --> 00:03:06,834
their fraud detection capabilities.

52
00:03:07,134 --> 00:03:11,184
These organizations are investing
millions of dollars on AI artificial

53
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:15,764
intelligence to protect the trillions
of transactions across the global market

54
00:03:16,104 --> 00:03:18,664
and improve their detection using AI.

55
00:03:19,339 --> 00:03:22,999
And demonstrate 30 to 50 percent increase
in the fraud detection accuracy while

56
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:26,849
processing the transaction 60 percent
faster than the traditional methods.

57
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:29,049
And real time, real world results.

58
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:34,139
So early adoption of AI fraud detection
has reported up to 60 percent reduction

59
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,589
in false positives and 40 percent
decrease in fraud related losses.

60
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:40,469
Let's go into machine learning.

61
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:46,889
And machine learning and data analysis
is a key backbone of AI fraud.

62
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:48,249
Detection systems.

63
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:53,609
So it processing vast data sets and
evolving to handle new fraud tactics.

64
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:59,649
So these system analyze intricate patterns
and correlations that human might miss

65
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:05,679
analyst might miss so it accuracy rate
is more than 95 And enhance the security.

66
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:09,899
So AI iterates, leveraging capabilities
significantly strengthen fraud

67
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:14,499
prevention, ensuring that systems
adaptable to increase complex threats by

68
00:04:14,899 --> 00:04:17,129
continually refining detection methods.

69
00:04:17,309 --> 00:04:21,119
And AI offers more robust security
compared to traditional approaches.

70
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:26,099
And here, the real world impact
was AI powered fraud detection

71
00:04:26,109 --> 00:04:29,389
has demonstrated up to 50 percent
improvement in detection accuracy.

72
00:04:29,714 --> 00:04:33,364
And while processing transactions 60
percent faster than conventional methods.

73
00:04:33,704 --> 00:04:37,694
So financial institutions adopting
AI prevention billions of dollars

74
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:42,974
in potential fraud, which some banks
reported like over 2 billion in

75
00:04:42,974 --> 00:04:44,394
fraud prevention in a single year.

76
00:04:44,424 --> 00:04:45,894
That's a big, huge number.

77
00:04:46,104 --> 00:04:52,264
So let's continue with the anomaly
detection and anomaly detection.

78
00:04:52,764 --> 00:04:57,814
He's AI advanced anomaly detection system
continuously monitoring transactions

79
00:04:57,844 --> 00:05:02,684
and instantly flag suspicious behaviors
that deviate from established patterns.

80
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:07,054
So this real time monitoring allows
for immediate risk assessment, enabling

81
00:05:07,054 --> 00:05:11,034
quick responses to potential threats
and strengthening fraud prevention.

82
00:05:11,364 --> 00:05:15,084
Here are the three categories
of anomaly detection.

83
00:05:15,104 --> 00:05:19,284
The one is baseline establishment and real
time monitoring and alert generations.

84
00:05:19,784 --> 00:05:21,994
Let's drive into real
time risk assessment.

85
00:05:22,494 --> 00:05:26,584
In the real time risk assessment,
AI system assess risk in real time.

86
00:05:26,854 --> 00:05:30,784
offering immediate insights and allowing
financial institutions to take shift.

87
00:05:31,154 --> 00:05:34,964
protective actions when suspicious
activities are detected.

88
00:05:35,074 --> 00:05:39,201
this protective approach ensures
that fraud is mitigated before

89
00:05:39,201 --> 00:05:40,878
it cause significantly harm.

90
00:05:40,878 --> 00:05:42,555
three type of detections.

91
00:05:43,335 --> 00:05:47,495
in risk management, they are
showcasing here in three categories.

92
00:05:47,525 --> 00:05:52,015
One is transaction analysis and
risk scoring and automated action.

93
00:05:52,515 --> 00:05:57,965
And building a robust strategies, building
robust fraud prevention strategies are

94
00:05:58,585 --> 00:06:04,985
By using AI transformation, by using raw
data into actionable insights, enabling

95
00:06:04,985 --> 00:06:09,405
organizations to prevent fraud, detect
threats early, and respond swiftly.

96
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:14,405
By implementing multi layer defense
approach, institutions can reduce

97
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:19,265
financial losses, increase operational
efficiencies, and maintain a secure

98
00:06:19,265 --> 00:06:21,225
environment for legitimate transactions.

99
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:27,125
And the key Importance of three
type of categories have the

100
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:28,935
strategies, DOPA strategies.

101
00:06:29,095 --> 00:06:32,775
One is data governance and second
one is model validation and third

102
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:33,935
one is continuous monitoring.

103
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:38,345
Let's dive into actionable insights
here in the actionable insights that

104
00:06:38,345 --> 00:06:43,185
transform raw data into powerful action
steps through AI powered fraud analysis.

105
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:46,815
Our comprehensive approach helps
organizations not only prevent

106
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:49,895
potential threats, but also
reduce the financial losses.

107
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:55,665
So these are the three actionable
insights, strategies, prevention,

108
00:06:55,765 --> 00:06:57,555
detection and response.

109
00:06:58,055 --> 00:07:02,555
And the project growth as I mentioned
that the detection fraud market is

110
00:07:02,575 --> 00:07:05,465
growing to 190 billion dollars by 2030.

111
00:07:05,905 --> 00:07:10,905
