00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:05,224
Thank you.

20
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:08,934
Let's talk about the evolution
of SAP Enterprise Solutions.

21
00:01:09,164 --> 00:01:12,765
It has been marked by significant
technological advancement and

22
00:01:12,765 --> 00:01:14,285
changing business requirements.

23
00:01:14,754 --> 00:01:20,656
SAP journey from its initial R3 system to
the current S4 HANA platform represents

24
00:01:20,656 --> 00:01:23,324
a fundamental shift in the enterprise
resource planning architecture.

25
00:01:23,635 --> 00:01:28,825
The traditional SAP R3 system introduced
in 1990s established the foundation

26
00:01:28,825 --> 00:01:31,265
for client server enterprise computing.

27
00:01:31,594 --> 00:01:34,710
But it was limited by its
rigid data structures and

28
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,189
batch processing capabilities.

29
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:42,413
With the advent of in memory computing
technology, SAP introduced HANA in

30
00:01:42,413 --> 00:01:47,020
2010, making a pivotal transition
toward real time data processing

31
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:49,239
and analytics capabilities.

32
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:55,539
The subsequent development of S4 HANA
represented a complete reimagining of

33
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:01,460
the core ERP system, optimized for cloud
development and digital operations.

34
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,119
Let's look at SAP S4 HANA architecture.

35
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:08,579
The architecture foundation of SAP
S4 HANA represents a significant

36
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:12,839
evolution in the enterprise software
design, built upon sophisticated

37
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:17,219
in memory database structures that
enable real time data processing and

38
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:18,860
advanced analytical capabilities.

39
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:22,640
The core architectural components
comprise three primary layers,

40
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,149
the database layer, powered by SAP
HANA column storage technology, the

41
00:02:27,149 --> 00:02:30,870
application layer, which hosts the
business logic and processing engines.

42
00:02:31,295 --> 00:02:35,675
and the presentation layer, which
delivers the SAP user experience.

43
00:02:36,214 --> 00:02:40,524
This architecture facilitates the
streamlined data processing by

44
00:02:40,524 --> 00:02:45,194
eliminating the traditional aggregates
and redundant data storages, resulting

45
00:02:45,195 --> 00:02:49,565
in significantly reduced data footprints
and enhanced system performance.

46
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:54,825
The simplified data model reduces the
storage requirements by up to 80%.

47
00:02:55,554 --> 00:02:58,795
With the embedded analytical
seamlessly integrated into

48
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:03,350
operational process, Organizational

49
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,540
decision making, driving operational
efficiency, and business agility.

50
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,800
Let's talk about integration framework.

51
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,950
The integration framework between SAP S4
HANA and BTP established a confidential

52
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,470
connectivity layer that enables
seamless communication between various

53
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,630
enterprise applications and services.

54
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,239
This framework utilizes the cloud
integration suite, API management,

55
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:30,829
and integration advisory to
orchestrate complex business

56
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,660
process across hybrid landscapes.

57
00:03:33,035 --> 00:03:37,725
The integration architecture supports
both synchronous and asynchronous

58
00:03:37,845 --> 00:03:42,285
communication patterns, enabling real
time data exchange while maintaining

59
00:03:42,285 --> 00:03:44,774
the system reliability and scalability.

60
00:03:45,505 --> 00:03:49,345
Key integration patterns include
