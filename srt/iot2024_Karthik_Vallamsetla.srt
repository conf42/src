00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,950
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,910
Thank you for joining me today.

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,640
My name is Karthik Valamsetla and
I'm excited to share how modern

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,559
web APIs can help us create
incredible user experiences.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,559
These APIs like geolocation, web
notifications, and intersection

6
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:22,700
observer are powerful tools that let
us make web applications more dynamic.

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,270
personalized and engaging.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,160
Over the next few minutes, I will
share some real world examples from

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,240
my projects, show how these APIs have
driven user engagement, increased

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,699
satisfaction and even boosted revenue.

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,000
Let's dive in.

12
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:43,780
Before we get into the details,
here's what we will be covering today.

13
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,800
First, I will introduce modern web
APIs, why they are essential for

14
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:53,855
UI development, Then we will look
at how APIs have evolved to become

15
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:56,155
the versatile tools we use today.

16
00:00:56,825 --> 00:01:02,045
Next, I will take you through
three key APIs, the Geolocation

17
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:07,245
API, the Web Notifications API,
and the Intersection Observer API.

18
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:11,944
We will explore how each of
them enhances user experience.

19
00:01:12,755 --> 00:01:14,665
We will also compare their strengths.

20
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,289
Discuss how combining APIs can
create richer experiences and

21
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:24,990
touch on some challenges and best
practices for using them effectively.

22
00:01:25,755 --> 00:01:30,365
Finally, I will wrap up with key
takeaways and a quick look at what's

23
00:01:30,385 --> 00:01:32,725
next in the world of web APIs.

24
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:35,835
So what exactly are modern web APIs?

25
00:01:36,335 --> 00:01:39,375
They are tools that let us
bring dynamic and interactive

26
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,184
features to web applications.

27
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:46,805
Within these APIs, we can create user
interfaces that feel personalized and

28
00:01:46,915 --> 00:01:49,455
responsive, similar to native apps.

29
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:55,820
For example, in one of my e commerce
projects, we used the geolocation API to

30
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:01,520
show customers nearby stores and paired
it with the web notifications API to alert

31
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,460
them about flash sales in their area.

32
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,089
The result, a 30 percent increase in
user engagement during the campaign.

33
00:02:10,779 --> 00:02:15,040
These APIs are a critical part of
today's web development landscape.

34
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,850
Especially as progressive web apps
continue to blur the line between

35
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,580
web and native applications.

36
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,590
Let's take a step back and
look at how APIs have evolved.

37
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,880
Early APIs were simple.

38
00:02:28,619 --> 00:02:32,930
They could do things like update text
or hide an element on a web page.

39
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,290
Useful, but not particularly interactive.

40
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,920
Today's APIs are more powerful.

41
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,109
They let us access device features.

42
00:02:43,465 --> 00:02:48,275
handle real time interactions and
even create offline experiences.

43
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:54,194
For example, in one project we used
modern web APIs to build a progressive

44
00:02:54,195 --> 00:02:56,055
web app for an e commerce site.

45
00:02:56,615 --> 00:03:00,945
Customers could browse products
they have previously viewed even

46
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:02,665
without an internet connection.

47
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:08,234
This feature was a hit especially during
high traffic periods like Black Friday.

48
00:03:09,075 --> 00:03:13,445
Because it made the shopping experience
smoother and less frustrating.

49
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,229
Let's start with the geolocation API.

50
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,010
This API lets us access a user's location,
with their permission, of course.

51
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,240
It's perfect for creating
location aware experiences.

52
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,639
In one project, we used the Geolocation
API for an outdoor gear retailer.

53
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,169
Based on the user's location and
local weather, we recommended hiking

54
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:39,389
gear that suited their environment.

55
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:43,339
This made the experience
feel personal and relevant.

56
00:03:43,779 --> 00:03:46,859
And we saw a 20 percent
increase in conversions.

57
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:49,729
But it's not just about functionality.

58
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:52,969
Privacy and user trust are critical.

59
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:57,759
Always explain why you are
requesting location data and

60
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,939
ensure it's handled securely.

61
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:04,679
In another project, we added
a fallback option for users to

62
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:06,439
manually enter their zip code.

63
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:11,489
This simple addition helped
retain 15 percent of users who

64
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:13,599
initially denied location access.

65
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,929
Next up is the Web Notifications API.

66
00:04:17,384 --> 00:04:20,174
which is all about keeping users engaged.

67
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:25,064
This API lets you send push
notifications to users even

68
00:04:25,074 --> 00:04:26,774
when they are not on your site.

69
00:04:27,274 --> 00:04:31,594
For an e commerce client, we
implemented price drop alerts for

70
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,364
wishlist items using this API.

71
00:04:33,864 --> 00:04:39,464
These personalized notifications drove a
25 percent increase in click through rates

72
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:44,684
and generated over hundreds of thousands
in revenue during the holiday season.

73
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:48,754
That said, you need to be
careful with notifications.

74
00:04:49,334 --> 00:04:52,164
Overusing them can lead to user fatigue.

75
00:04:52,814 --> 00:04:57,534
That's why it's important to let users
customize their notification preferences

76
00:04:58,024 --> 00:05:00,504
and to time your messages strategically.

77
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:06,324
For example, sending reminders during
lunch breaks or evenings doubled

78
00:05:06,394 --> 00:05:08,884
engagement in one of our campaigns.

79
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:14,824
The Intersection Observer API might not
sound glamorous, but it's a powerhouse

80
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:17,174
when it comes to optimizing performance.

81
00:05:17,704 --> 00:05:20,979
It tracks when elements
enter or leave the viewport.

82
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:25,469
making it perfect for lazy
loading and triggering animations.

83
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:31,209
For a fashion retailer, we used this
API to lazy load product images.

84
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:35,789
Instead of loading everything up
front, images were loaded only

85
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:37,569
when the user scrolled to them.

86
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:43,130
This reduced page load times by 35
percent and directly led to a 12

87
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,510
percent boost in mobile conversions.

88
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,550
This API isn't just about speed.

89
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:53,000
It's about creating a smooth,
enjoyable experience that keeps

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
users engaged, especially on mobile
devices when performance is crucial.

91
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,000
Let's take a quick look
at how these APIs compare.

92
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:08,000
The Geolocation API provides
user location, making content

93
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,170
and navigation more personalized.

94
00:06:10,595 --> 00:06:16,645
The Web Notifications API engages users in
real time, driving them back to your site.

95
00:06:16,805 --> 00:06:22,345
The Intersection Observer API optimizes
performance by reducing resource usage.

96
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:26,594
Each API plays a special role,
but together, they create a

97
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:30,125
toolkit for building responsive
and interactive applications.

98
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:34,185
Now, what happens when
you combine these APIs?

99
00:06:34,845 --> 00:06:39,225
You get powerful synergies that take
user experience to the next level.

100
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:45,310
For a home goods retailer, we combined
the geolocation API to identify users

101
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:50,830
near stores, the web notifications
API to send alerts about in store

102
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:56,930
promotions, the intersection observer
API to animate banners as users scrolled.

103
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:04,010
This integration increased food traffic
by 30% and boosted local sales by 20%.

104
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:09,210
It's a great example of how APIs
working together can create a

105
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,540
seamless and engaging experience.

106
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,720
Of course, APIs aren't
without their challenges.

107
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:17,860
Privacy is a big one.

108
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,340
Users need to know how their
data is being used and must

109
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,390
feel confident that it's secure.

110
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:29,210
Always be transparent and comply
with the regulators like GDPR.

111
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,110
Another challenge is avoiding
notification fatigue.

112
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:38,629
Be thoughtful about how often you
send notifications and allow users

113
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:40,340
to control their preferences.

114
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,710
Finally, performance is key,
especially on mobile devices.

115
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:51,620
Using the Intersection Observer API to
manage resource loading has been a game

116
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:57,060
changer in many of my projects, ensuring
speed without sacrificing functionality.

117
00:07:57,535 --> 00:08:03,835
To wrap things up, modern web APIs like
geolocation, web notifications, and

118
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:08,895
intersection observer have revolutionized
how we build web applications.

119
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:13,774
They help us create experiences
that are faster, more engaging,

120
00:08:14,014 --> 00:08:15,494
and deeply personalized.

121
00:08:15,715 --> 00:08:20,875
By combining these tools thoughtfully, we
can deliver applications that rival native

122
00:08:20,885 --> 00:08:23,605
apps in functionality and performance.

123
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,345
And this is just the beginning.

124
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:31,495
Emerging technologies like AR,
VR, and AI powered APIs promise to

125
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:33,765
push user engagement even further.

126
00:08:33,885 --> 00:08:35,485
Thank you for joining me today.

127
00:08:35,945 --> 00:08:39,895
I would love to hear your thoughts
or questions about these APIs and

128
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:43,765
how they can be used to create
even better user experiences.
