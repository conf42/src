1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:00,950
Hello all.

2
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,120
I'm Na Kala.

3
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:08,030
I'm excited to talk to you today about
how Cloud is evolving and also more

4
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:12,320
importantly, how we can bring together
different cloud platforms and make

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,780
them work seamlessly and securely.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,770
We'll be discussing four main key points.

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:23,480
In this presentation the first one is
AI driven, API Management, followed

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,950
by confidential computing, zero
trust and event driven architectures.

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:33,830
These are game changes for any of
the industry that is already into

10
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,670
multiple clouds or that is going
to invest into multiple clouds.

11
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:41,750
Moving on to the very first
slide, multi-cloud reality.

12
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,730
94% of enterprises use
multi-cloud platforms.

13
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:53,900
They'll be using AWS Azure or Google
Cloud to leverage specific capabilities.

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,630
The advantage is that vendor lockin is
totally avoided, but the cons is that,

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,849
integration issues exist because the
by the data communication to and fro

16
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:11,009
between the systems needs some effective
and comprehensive integration strategy.

17
00:01:11,339 --> 00:01:16,229
And mostly will be facing data
synchronization hurdles, which will

18
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,609
lead to implementation delays and also,
which will lead to budget overruns.

19
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:22,789
And also there'll be many issues.

20
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:26,314
With security policies because
each cloud will come with its own

21
00:01:26,314 --> 00:01:31,114
security and we need to create a
unified security policy that can be

22
00:01:31,114 --> 00:01:33,144
used to overcome any of the issues.

23
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:34,089
Okay.

24
00:01:34,589 --> 00:01:35,939
Moving on to the second slide.

25
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,939
Benefits of effective cloud integration.

26
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:44,009
So as long as we have a comprehensive
integration strategy, the deployment

27
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:47,789
rate will be faster and we can
see 30 to 40% of improvement.

28
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:50,249
And also there'll be grade agility.

29
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,619
Agility is directly proportional
to marketer around or business turn

30
00:01:55,249 --> 00:02:00,574
turnaround because we will build and,
deployed things faster, so that will give

31
00:02:00,574 --> 00:02:02,284
a positive impact to the whole business.

32
00:02:02,284 --> 00:02:07,424
And also resilience, especially during
service interruptions will be benefited.

33
00:02:07,924 --> 00:02:11,074
I identified few of the
integration complexity challenges

34
00:02:11,374 --> 00:02:12,874
that will be commonly faced.

35
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:19,524
One thing the main thing is that with each
cloud edition the integration complexity

36
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:22,074
will be increased by at least 70%.

37
00:02:22,464 --> 00:02:26,474
And also each cloud will have
different security models.

38
00:02:26,474 --> 00:02:31,234
AWS will have its own model and
Google Cloud will have its own model.

39
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:35,739
We have to make sure that the
security policies is correctly, are

40
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,839
correctly laid as discussed before.

41
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:41,079
And also there'll be a lot of
inconsistencies with the a p

42
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:43,749
structures and authentication
and authorization mechanisms.

43
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:48,129
And also there'll be differences between
data formats and storage mechanisms.

44
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:51,059
AI driven API management platforms.

45
00:02:51,784 --> 00:02:56,804
There are mainly efficiency gains
and governance benefits, and this

46
00:02:56,804 --> 00:02:58,724
is not a traditional approach.

47
00:02:58,724 --> 00:03:02,474
This is AI driven, so the
bugs will be decreased.

48
00:03:02,504 --> 00:03:07,934
And also the overall, implementation
time will be cut down and there'll be

49
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:12,524
several other benefits for few of the
benefits are identified and written here.

50
00:03:12,884 --> 00:03:19,184
So reduction in API design improvement in
overall API, usability metrics and also

51
00:03:19,184 --> 00:03:21,374
reduction in MA manual documentation.

52
00:03:21,374 --> 00:03:27,044
Efforts and benefits are mostly related
to performance optimizations and also

53
00:03:27,044 --> 00:03:29,024
related to compliance and security.

54
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:33,399
So we can see policy violations
reduction, compliance verification,

55
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:38,569
time improvement, and then latency
through traffic optimization reduction

56
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:40,759
and also resource provisioning.

57
00:03:40,809 --> 00:03:42,399
Costs will get reduced.

58
00:03:42,899 --> 00:03:46,179
And moving on to the next
slide enhanced security through

59
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:48,219
AI driven a BI management.

60
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,324
So there are in this chart.

61
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:56,899
The dark color ones are a traditional
approach, and the lighter color ones the

62
00:03:56,899 --> 00:04:01,919
green the bright green ones belong to
ai, a approach or AI enhanced approach.

63
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:08,139
So have the they will be reduction
in false positive rate and

64
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:10,659
also exploitation reduction.

65
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:15,019
So we'll be able to, du reduce
exploitation by detecting them early and

66
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:20,239
also attack detection will be showing a
positive impact when we go with AI models.

67
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:28,389
So overall on an average 78.3
successful exploitation effort attempt.

68
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:33,109
And then, machine learning models
can detect up to 93% of API

69
00:04:33,109 --> 00:04:37,339
based attacks while maintaining
false positive rates below 4%.

70
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:43,709
So AI driven is more secure and
also it'll mitigate more protection

71
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:48,089
vulnerabilities before even the
exploitation items are occurred.

72
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:52,494
And before even the traditional methods
or traditional strategies kick in,

73
00:04:52,594 --> 00:04:54,294
AI will take care of most of them.

74
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,444
And confidential computing.

75
00:04:56,724 --> 00:05:00,224
So confidential computing
mostly rotates around the

76
00:05:00,224 --> 00:05:03,524
concept of half data is secured.

77
00:05:03,944 --> 00:05:09,604
So data, when data is in use,
AI models will secure it even

78
00:05:09,604 --> 00:05:12,384
more even more in a better way.

79
00:05:12,434 --> 00:05:16,634
When I mean in use, it's nothing but
being in transit, but data at rest.

80
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:21,084
We will be predicting it either based
using traditional or security model.

81
00:05:21,444 --> 00:05:24,494
So traditional or AI based security model.

82
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:29,594
So data addressed, sophisticated
encryption algorithms, protect

83
00:05:29,594 --> 00:05:33,784
store data from unauthorized
access and data in transit.

84
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:34,924
T-L-S-S-S.

85
00:05:35,174 --> 00:05:39,254
S SL protocols and encrypted
channel safeguard data during

86
00:05:39,254 --> 00:05:42,344
transmission and data in use.

87
00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:46,534
Hardware based ttes
create secure enclaves.

88
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:50,974
That product data during computation
and complete protection, comprehensive

89
00:05:50,974 --> 00:05:56,504
security framework ensures data remains
encrypted throughout its entire lifecycle.

90
00:05:57,004 --> 00:06:01,934
These specialized enclaves whatever
we are discussing about, especially

91
00:06:01,934 --> 00:06:07,734
for data in use or for TES maintain
encryption during during active

92
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:12,804
computational process, creating a
secure, isolated environment that.

93
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:15,234
Prevents otherized access.

94
00:06:15,534 --> 00:06:20,214
So even for users or system
administrators or cloud service

95
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,714
themselves will not have access.

96
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:26,954
So this is more secure and confidential
computing performance breakthrough.

97
00:06:27,194 --> 00:06:30,254
So it is 33 times more fast.

98
00:06:30,304 --> 00:06:34,564
Organizations implementing confidential
computing for analytics and their AI

99
00:06:34,564 --> 00:06:36,859
workloads have reported up to 33 x fast.

100
00:06:37,804 --> 00:06:41,974
Processing and hardware enforced security.

101
00:06:42,544 --> 00:06:48,154
The tes Predict application from
attacks with privileged system access,

102
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:54,464
effectively mitigating threats from any
of the administrators, hypervisors BIOS

103
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:57,124
and OS and other operating systems.

104
00:06:57,754 --> 00:07:00,004
Expanded capabilities also exist.

105
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:05,869
So Intel's third SGX implementations
have expanded secure memory capacity

106
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:10,939
from 1 28 MB 2 5 12 gb dramatically
increasing the scope of workloads that

107
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:13,629
benefit from hardware based protection.

108
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:18,419
Industry applications of confidential
computing healthcare, definitely

109
00:07:18,489 --> 00:07:23,349
healthcare organizations can securely
process a PHI in the cloud while

110
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:25,329
maintaining HIPAA con compliance.

111
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:31,149
Enabling advanced analytics on patient
data by disclosing all the sensitive

112
00:07:31,154 --> 00:07:34,309
in information and financial services.

113
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:37,519
Like financial institutions
can perform complex analytics.

114
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:39,769
And research collaboration.

115
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:44,569
Federated learning frameworks allow
multiple organizations to collectively

116
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:49,399
train AI models on their combined data
sets while mathematically guaranteeing

117
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:54,109
that no party can access the original
data from other participants.

118
00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:56,019
Zero trust architecture.

119
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,179
So never trust, always verify.

120
00:07:58,429 --> 00:08:01,424
Zero trust architecture
principle is that it will.

121
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:06,829
Require a continuous authentication and
authorization of all entities regardless

122
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:09,859
of their location or network connection.

123
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:13,719
So least privilege access
will be enforced here.

124
00:08:13,929 --> 00:08:18,279
So minimum necessary permissions and
then isolated network zones by workload.

125
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:22,449
And also it'll calculate all the
real time behavior analytics.

126
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:27,719
And then we, it'll have lot of
identity verification principles, like

127
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:31,319
advanced authentication frameworks
and also custom authentication

128
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,599
frameworks that can be used.

129
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:38,579
So this approach replaces all
the traditional security with a

130
00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:44,429
model that is Zooms breach and
verifies each request as though it

131
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:46,379
originates from untrusted network.

132
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,599
It continuously keeps pinging us
and verifying us which is great.

133
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:53,804
This is definitely having a lot of impact.

134
00:08:54,464 --> 00:08:57,704
And pros on every everybody's business.

135
00:08:57,754 --> 00:09:04,314
Organization implementations experience
of frameworks, experience 43% reduction

136
00:09:04,314 --> 00:09:09,114
in successful network introductions,
37% reduction in security incident

137
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:13,824
response costs, and 29% decrease in
overall security management overhead.

138
00:09:14,349 --> 00:09:19,839
And also advanced authentication
frameworks reported a 92% success rate in

139
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,519
pre preventing credential based attacks.

140
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:27,529
While organizations employing real
time behavior analytics detected

141
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:33,354
suspicious activities, 73% faster
than those using periodic security

142
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:37,764
scanning approaches, event driven
architectures for real time integrations.

143
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:43,774
So event driven architectures mostly,
or rotate around using system bus and

144
00:09:43,774 --> 00:09:48,334
using subscribers, publishers, and making
the tasks even more fast and easier.

145
00:09:48,814 --> 00:09:54,784
So even generation system changes trigger
events and routes them to subscribers

146
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:56,914
and subscribers React to the events.

147
00:09:57,274 --> 00:10:00,184
Also there'll be state synchronization
where system will maintain

148
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:05,424
consistency across all the services
and keep updating the right data

149
00:10:05,424 --> 00:10:06,924
and also getting the right data.

150
00:10:07,264 --> 00:10:10,074
Even architecture is loosely coupled.

151
00:10:10,704 --> 00:10:14,544
It supports real time data synchronization
across drivers cloud environments.

152
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:19,164
So whenever there is a change,
immediately through through the

153
00:10:19,194 --> 00:10:22,014
bus, you can kick off the change.

154
00:10:22,944 --> 00:10:27,564
Organizations imple implementing
EDA frameworks experience a 58%

155
00:10:27,564 --> 00:10:32,234
reduction in data integr integrated
latency compared to traditional

156
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:34,454
scheduled batch processing approaches.

157
00:10:34,954 --> 00:10:35,614
Just a second.

158
00:10:36,114 --> 00:10:36,334
Yep.

159
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:41,274
And the performance metrics I gave few
of the performance metrics in the slide.

160
00:10:41,964 --> 00:10:47,684
So what is the latency reduction and
how many events will we processed per

161
00:10:47,684 --> 00:10:52,334
second message delivery guarantee,
responsiveness increase, incident

162
00:10:52,664 --> 00:10:54,714
reduction maintenance cost reduction.

163
00:10:55,214 --> 00:10:59,504
So this architectural approach allows
organizations to build responsive

164
00:10:59,504 --> 00:11:03,884
systems that immediately react
to business events as they occur.

165
00:11:04,214 --> 00:11:09,284
I would say this is more proactive in
nature and it'll be very much helpful for

166
00:11:09,284 --> 00:11:14,244
industries to use them as their real time
or near near real time most of the time.

167
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:20,109
Financial services industrial, IOD
and global Enterprises are heavily

168
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:21,984
using all the EDI architectures.

169
00:11:22,704 --> 00:11:26,244
And then for financial
services, 63% faster.

170
00:11:26,814 --> 00:11:30,574
An anomaly detection for
production for potential fraud

171
00:11:31,054 --> 00:11:33,484
scenarios and industrial iot.

172
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:39,824
There is a 88% improvement in real time
processing capability, enabling monitoring

173
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:46,664
systems to process data from over 25,000
sensors with a sub-second response time.

174
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:51,664
And also for the Global Enterprises,
there is a 71% reduction in

175
00:11:51,704 --> 00:11:56,414
cross-regional data inconsistencies
while using EDA, which is really great.

176
00:11:56,914 --> 00:12:03,394
And overall the future of the secure
platform integration is all the four

177
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:05,494
aspects that we have discussed right now.

178
00:12:05,744 --> 00:12:11,734
We have to create a framework in such
a way that all of these, at all of

179
00:12:11,734 --> 00:12:16,144
these key points that we have covered
are balanced in each and every strategy

180
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,844
that we come up for the organization.

181
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:22,184
So as organization continues their
digital transformational journeys

182
00:12:22,494 --> 00:12:26,724
these approaches will become
increasingly essential components of

183
00:12:26,724 --> 00:12:29,064
a strategic technology foundation.

184
00:12:29,314 --> 00:12:29,944
Thank you all.

185
00:12:30,444 --> 00:12:32,304
That's my take.
