00:00:46,205 --> 00:00:49,445
Let's dive in and explore
exciting transformation.

14
00:00:49,945 --> 00:00:54,415
Traditional claims processing involves
extensive paperwork, manual data entry,

15
00:00:54,505 --> 00:00:59,005
and human decision making, leading to
inefficiencies and inconsistencies,

16
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:05,515
errors and delays, not only frustrate
patients and providers, but also increase

17
00:01:05,575 --> 00:01:07,405
administrative costs for insurers.

00:01:13,705 --> 00:01:16,255
AI achieves this through
four key functions.

21
00:01:16,675 --> 00:01:17,605
Rule ENC coding.

22
00:01:18,085 --> 00:01:22,135
It converts complex policies into
structured machine learning, readable

23
00:01:22,135 --> 00:01:27,535
rules, ensuring compliance and insurance
regulations, pattern recognition.

24
00:01:27,774 --> 00:01:32,304
AI can analyze past claim data to
detect common trends and improve

25
00:01:32,304 --> 00:01:34,135
the accuracy of claims assessment.

26
00:01:34,885 --> 00:01:39,265
Consistency, like human assessors,
AI applies the same decision

27
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:44,095
criteria to every claim,
eliminating bias and variability.

28
00:01:44,965 --> 00:01:45,595
Adaptability.

29
00:01:45,865 --> 00:01:46,765
Adaptability.

30
00:01:47,035 --> 00:01:51,685
As policies and regulations change, AI
driven systems can update their rule sets

31
00:01:51,895 --> 00:01:54,234
dynamically without major disruptions.

32
00:01:54,745 --> 00:01:58,195
These capabilities collectively
streamline claims processing, reduce

33
00:01:58,195 --> 00:02:02,035
costs, and enhance the overall
efficiency of dental insurance workflows.

34
00:02:02,535 --> 00:02:06,540
For AI to function effectively in
dental insurance claims processing,

35
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,320
it relies on three essential
components, a policy driven rule

36
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,990
engine, a multi-stage claims validator,
and an advanced analytics engine.

37
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,420
These components work together to ensure
accuracy, efficiency, and compliance.

38
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,790
the policy driven rule engine transform.

39
00:02:25,494 --> 00:02:29,005
Insurance policies into
structured algorithmic rules.

40
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:34,584
It codifies eligibility criteria,
current limitation and reimbursement

41
00:02:34,584 --> 00:02:39,894
policies, ensuring that every claim is
processed based on predefined guidelines.

42
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:44,454
This minimizes discrepancies and
ensures fairness in decision making.

43
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:49,644
The multi-stage claim validator
automates the validation process,

44
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:54,984
checking each claim against multiple
criteria such as patient eligibility,

45
00:02:55,045 --> 00:02:56,904
treatment history, and policy terms.

46
00:02:57,424 --> 00:03:02,795
Meanwhile, the advanced analytics engine
leverages AI and machine learning to

47
00:03:02,795 --> 00:03:08,165

Together these components create
a seamless, highly efficient

49
00:03:12,755 --> 00:03:16,404
claims management system, and we
understand the core components.

50
00:03:16,885 --> 00:03:20,185
Let's break down how rule-based
AI actually processes claims.

51
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,380
The workflow can be divided into four
main stages, each improving efficiency

52
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,000
and reducing manual interventions.

53
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,280
The first step is claim submission and
initial processing where AI validates

54
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,500
patient and provided details, ensuring
eligibility before proceeding next.

55
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:41,745
The system applies predefined
rule, application and validation,

56
00:03:42,105 --> 00:03:45,645
analyzing treatment codes and
checking benefit calculations,

57
00:03:46,155 --> 00:03:48,375
and verifying clinical necessity.

58
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:51,435
This eliminates the need of
manual cross-referencing.

59
00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:56,915
In the cross-checking against previous
treatment stage, AI ensures that

60
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:01,475
claim aligns with the patient dental
history and treatment patterns.

61
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:07,924
Finally, frequency limitation processing,
which enforces policy restrictions such as

62
00:04:07,924 --> 00:04:10,505
annual visits, cap, or lifetime maximums.

63
00:04:11,255 --> 00:04:17,704
The structured approach ensure that claims
are handled quickly, accurately, and

64
00:04:17,704 --> 00:04:19,894
in compliance with insurance policies.
