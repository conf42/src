1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,970
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,679
My name is Neetu Gangwani.

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,830
Today, I'm going to represent
energy efficient, cost optimized

4
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:10,830
serverless computing strategies,
challenges and future directions.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,039
Serverless computing has transformed
cloud computing, offering remarkable

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,529
cost saving and operational simplicity.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,509
However, the growing adoption
of serverless workloads raises

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,620
concern about energy footprints.

9
00:00:26,265 --> 00:00:30,145
This presentation explores the
intersection of energy efficiency

10
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:35,225
and cost effectiveness in serverless
computing, highlighting innovative

11
00:00:35,275 --> 00:00:37,575
strategies and addressing key challenges.

12
00:00:38,015 --> 00:00:43,325
Join us as we delve into the future
of sustainable cloud computing.

13
00:00:43,764 --> 00:00:47,105
Now let's see why the serverless
computing is in trend.

14
00:00:47,675 --> 00:00:52,855
The main reason serverless computing is
in trend is because scaling on demand.

15
00:00:52,855 --> 00:00:57,904
Serverless platforms dynamically
adjusts computing resources within

16
00:00:58,755 --> 00:01:01,824
milliseconds, automatically scaling
from handling a few requests to

17
00:01:01,844 --> 00:01:04,465
the millions without intervention.

18
00:01:05,175 --> 00:01:11,305
This intelligence scaling ensures optimal
performance while preventing both resource

19
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:14,404
wastages and the application's bottleneck.

20
00:01:14,785 --> 00:01:17,674
Another one is pay per use pricing.

21
00:01:18,134 --> 00:01:23,014
With a revolutionary pricing model,
organizations only pay for precise

22
00:01:23,055 --> 00:01:25,614
computation time in milliseconds.

23
00:01:26,074 --> 00:01:31,344
This granular approach can reduce cloud
costs by 40 80 percent compared to

24
00:01:31,344 --> 00:01:37,334
traditional servers, making enterprise
grade computing accessible to all.

25
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:42,884
Another one is Simplified Operations
By abstracting away infrastructure

26
00:01:42,924 --> 00:01:47,524
complexity, serverless enables
developers to deploy 4x faster.

27
00:01:48,214 --> 00:01:53,664
Teams can focus on innovation and business
logic rather than managing servers,

28
00:01:53,674 --> 00:02:00,068
security patches, scaling, configurations,
dramatically accelerating time to market.

29
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:04,664
Next, Addressing the Energy
Footprints of Serverless

30
00:02:05,164 --> 00:02:07,784
So first one is energy aware auto scaling.

31
00:02:07,884 --> 00:02:12,194
Advanced machine learning algorithm
analyze historical workload patterns

32
00:02:12,224 --> 00:02:18,114
in real time metrics to dynamically
optimize resource allocation, reducing

33
00:02:18,134 --> 00:02:24,364
energy waste by up to 30 percent while
maintaining sub millisecond response time.

34
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:27,814
Another one is hardware
software co design.

35
00:02:28,194 --> 00:02:34,214
Integration of ARM based processor and
simply specialized hardware escalator.

36
00:02:34,714 --> 00:02:39,894
delivers up to 40 percent power
saving compared to traditional x86

37
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:45,244
architecture while custom firmware
optimization further energy efficiency.

38
00:02:45,744 --> 00:02:49,904
Third one is function chaining
optimization intelligent function

39
00:02:49,924 --> 00:02:55,834
orchestration reduces inter function
communication overhead by 50 percent

40
00:02:55,834 --> 00:03:01,954
through strategic co location and
data caching while automated workflow

41
00:03:01,984 --> 00:03:07,134
analysis eliminates redundant
compute cycle and memory operations.

42
00:03:07,634 --> 00:03:10,244
Emerging Energy Aware Pricing Model.

43
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:15,134
So what is 40 percent is a reduction,
whereas 25 percent is the cost saving.

44
00:03:15,794 --> 00:03:21,534
Advanced Carbon Aware Pricing Model
factor in real time energy cost and

45
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:26,304
environmental impact driving up to 40
percent reduction in data center power.

46
00:03:26,724 --> 00:03:31,964
consumption through smart workload
scheduling and resource optimization

47
00:03:32,454 --> 00:03:36,464
and 25 percent in the cost saving
implementation of AI driven

48
00:03:36,464 --> 00:03:41,584
resources allocations and energy
monitoring tools results in 25

49
00:03:41,584 --> 00:03:44,334
percent average cost saving enabling.

50
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:49,319

shift workloads to time and reason

51
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,679
with optimal energy efficiency.

52
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:56,529
