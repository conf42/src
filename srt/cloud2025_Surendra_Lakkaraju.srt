00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,159
Hey everyone, this is Srinidhar
Lakkaraju and I'm going to present

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,490
AI powered dynamic risk scoring
for e commerce transaction.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,420
This presentation introduces an
innovative framework for dynamic

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,009
risk assessment in e commerce fraud.

5
00:00:16,509 --> 00:00:21,809
detecting, using machine learning and
advanced machine learning techniques.

6
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:27,939
We will also explore how combining
reinforcement learning, Bayesian network,

7
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,769
and real time processing architecture
addresses the modern fraud detection

8
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:38,919
challenges and significantly improves
the accuracy of detection while

9
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:41,189
enhancing the customer experiences.

10
00:00:41,689 --> 00:00:45,009
As e commerce reaches
unprecedented scale, close to 5.

11
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:51,649
7 trillion dollars in e commerce
volume globally in 2024.

12
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:55,349
The fraudsters have been
deploying increasingly

13
00:00:55,349 --> 00:00:57,239
sophisticated attack strategies.

14
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,789
The fraud attempts have
been increased to 1.

15
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,529
8 percent of overall online revenue.

16
00:01:04,029 --> 00:01:09,179
The Redistone Static Square scoring
systems have become dangerously

17
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:15,814
inadequate, particularly In the face
of a staggering 307 percent surge

18
00:01:15,894 --> 00:01:21,274
in account takeover attacks, while
businesses invest heavily in fraud

19
00:01:21,294 --> 00:01:28,634
prevention, allocating close to 15
20 per customer, they face a critical

20
00:01:28,634 --> 00:01:31,844
challenge maintaining robust security.

21
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:38,889
without compromising the seamless shopping
experience that modern customers demand.

22
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:42,089
And also we have seen close to 6.

23
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:49,649
4 billion losses in card not present
fraud across the major online platforms.

24
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:56,781
So our approach is the dynamic
approach to the e commerce security.

25
00:01:56,781 --> 00:02:00,999
So we want to have four
different phases of it.

26
00:02:01,394 --> 00:02:07,154
The first being the multi layer
validation in which each transaction

27
00:02:07,154 --> 00:02:12,494
is passed through interconnected
AI validation gates, which combines

28
00:02:12,814 --> 00:02:16,765
with the rule based checks along
with the machine learning analysis.

29
00:02:17,265 --> 00:02:25,984
We use the advanced ML models where we are
processing the 3, 700 data signals in real

30
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:29,745
time, which includes transaction patterns.

31
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,100
It's user behavior.

32
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,780
and merchant risk profiles.

33
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,530
We want to do real time behavior analysis
where we want to see the advanced

34
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:45,150
device fingerprinting and network
analysis to detect suspicious patterns.

35
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,870
VPN usage and the bot
activities within milliseconds.

36
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,870
And we want to continuously, evolve.

37
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,630
So we want to have a self optimized
models that automatically adapt

38
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,479
to the new frauds tactics.

39
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,850
while learning from the transaction
outcomes and emerging threat patterns.

40
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:11,060
Our cutting edge architecture delivers
enterprise grade fraud prevention

41
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,330
through three synchronized layers.

42
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,590
Each component is engineered
for maximum performance.

43
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:24,620
seamlessly processing massive
transaction volumes while maintaining

44
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,460
strict latency requirements.

45
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:34,090
This robust foundation enables real
time risk assessment while automatically

46
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:39,870
adapting new to new threats, setting up
new standards for e commerce security.

47
00:03:40,619 --> 00:03:43,549
So these three layers are
the data ingestion layer.

48
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:49,240
In this layer, we process over
42, 000 transactions per second.

49
00:03:49,585 --> 00:03:55,335
with sub 200 milliseconds, ensuring
a real time fraud detection at scale.

50
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:59,754
The AI ML processing
engine, which powers 1.

51
00:03:59,835 --> 00:04:05,365
7 simultaneously user session
through intelligent load balancing

52
00:04:05,665 --> 00:04:08,094
and automated resource optimization.

53
00:04:08,594 --> 00:04:10,945
And the third one is a
dynamic threshold management.

54
00:04:11,705 --> 00:04:18,525
We execute 872 smart threshold
adjustments hourly, which allows us

55
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,205
to continuously adapt to the emerging.

56
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,820
Fraud patterns.

57
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,330
The reinforcement learning
implementation is network aware.

58
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:34,679
It has a network of strategies which
is distributed system of 200, sorry,

59
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:42,200
2847 nodes which can process close
to 47, 000 transactions per second.

60
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,040
The sophisticated architecture
has dramatically improved There is

61
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,800
detection accuracy by 42 percent.

62
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,270
The advanced feature engineering
can go through a deep analysis

63
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:01,470
of 3847 unique transaction
characteristics or features which

64
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:05,280
allow us to detect the fraud with 99.

65
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:12,359
4 percent accuracy Our system analyzes
the monitoring pattern across 847

66
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:18,699
distinct feature to identify suspicious
activity with unprecedented precision.

67
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,939
The optimized risk reward function.

68
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:28,839
Our holistic reward system
balances multiple critical metrics

69
00:05:29,489 --> 00:05:31,109
including the false positive.

70
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:36,079
The fraud detection, customer
satisfaction, and network performance.

71
00:05:36,809 --> 00:05:41,359
This balanced approach has driven
us a greater percent of improvement

72
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:43,419
in our overall system effectiveness.

73
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,969
The combination of vision
network architecture.

74
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:52,429
delivers industry leading fraud
detection by combining massive

75
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:56,569
scale real time processing with a
sophisticated probabilistic model.

76
00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:02,179
The system not only processes transactions
at unprecedented speed, but also

77
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:08,539
continuously adapts to new fraud patterns,
maintaining sub millisecond latency

78
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:18,229
while achieving a very good So the real
time processing is able to handle 47,

79
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:20,889
000 concurrent transactions per second.

80
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:29,009
With being up, using the 10847 distributed
nodes, we try to utilize the project

81
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:34,269
interference, which kind of leverages
these, interconnect decision nodes.

82
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,189
managing the 12, 647 dynamic
probabilistic relationships.

83
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:43,089
We have the feature processing
where we are able to analyze the

84
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:49,029
847 risk indicators in millisecond
to achieve to a fraud detection.

85
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:52,259
This allows us to have real time
updates as well where we are

86
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,359
adjusting all this 847k risk,
indicators, and the probabilities.

87
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:06,029
per second to have an understanding or
create a base for emerging patterns.

88
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:11,959
And then, the way we process these
risk variables transactions using the

89
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:17,759
advanced entropy reduction, we are able
to identify the emerging patterns as well.

90
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:23,109
The implementation of our AI powered
dynamic risk score system has delivered

91
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:27,869
exceptional improvements across
all critical performance metrics.

92
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:33,994
Most notable, we achieved a dramatic
33 percent reduction in false

93
00:07:33,994 --> 00:07:37,684
positive rates, dropping from 2.

94
00:07:37,684 --> 00:07:40,054
4 percent to 1.

95
00:07:40,364 --> 00:07:44,534
42%, while simultaneously increasing
our fraud detection rate by

96
00:07:44,554 --> 00:07:50,015
33 percent to reach industry
leading 99 percent accuracy.

97
00:07:50,515 --> 00:07:55,095
Customer experience has been
remarkable enhancements as well.

98
00:07:55,835 --> 00:08:00,025
The satisfaction score surging
from 30 percent to 75 percent

99
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:06,495
the improvement in the partial Attribute
or this improvement is partially because

100
00:08:06,515 --> 00:08:11,900
of the processing time Where we have
reduced our processing average time to

101
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:20,739
27 Close to now 600 milliseconds and
Also have the reliability or the system

102
00:08:20,989 --> 00:08:27,229
validity to be close to four nines
Ensuring that our service is active for

103
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,569
our customers and it's not going down

104
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:34,889
We have seen a challenge with
our data imbalance since these

105
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,239
fraudulence data are very or have
an extreme balance where only 0.

106
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:41,869
12 to 0.

107
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:44,779
27 transactions are fraudulent.

108
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:51,019
So making it much more difficult to
inherently identify or detect any action.

109
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,159
To solve that, we implemented a
sophisticated broad line smooth algorithm

110
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:01,559
combined with adaptive synthetic
sampling to balance data representation.

111
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:04,919
So we intelligently re sample the 3.

112
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:11,269
8 million transaction hourly to achieve
a near perfect balance instead of

113
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:20,179
having a data imbalanced where we
have 51 percent legitimate cases and

114
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:22,629
we have 48 percent fraudulent cases.

115
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:27,679
While doing this allows us to
increase our fraud detection accuracy.

116
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:34,124
By 48 percent for the minority
cases while Maintaining the

117
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:35,964
exception low false positive rate 2.

118
00:09:35,964 --> 00:09:37,084
3 percent.

119
00:09:37,584 --> 00:09:41,714
The real time processing architecture
enables us to do high speed processing

120
00:09:42,484 --> 00:09:47,744
Able to have massive data handling
provide real time updates and also

121
00:09:47,744 --> 00:09:50,894
increase the overall performance
of the system we are able to now

122
00:09:50,894 --> 00:09:57,074
process close to 2, 000 concurrent
transactions per second with industry

123
00:09:57,074 --> 00:10:02,919
leading Sub to 20 millisecond response
time, ensuring the seamless customer

124
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:06,029
experience, able to efficiently manage 4.

125
00:10:06,229 --> 00:10:13,349
2 terabytes of transaction data per
hour across distributed nodes while

126
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:15,519
maintaining the enterprise grade 4.

127
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:17,759
9 system reliability.

128
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:20,489
The advanced materialized
view architecture.

129
00:10:20,884 --> 00:10:25,494
Refreshes every, 200 milliseconds
or close to 200 milliseconds,

130
00:10:25,894 --> 00:10:30,924
delivering an 84% reduction in query
latency for instant fraud detection.

131
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:35,024
This allows us to have the real
time updates and allows us to real

132
00:10:35,024 --> 00:10:38,204
time call, call the fraud data.

133
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:45,609
We have able to have, receive, or
cut the processing time by 67%.

134
00:10:46,109 --> 00:10:49,859
While delivering a boost in the
transaction and throughput capacity.

135
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,809
So that's a major improvement
in our performance

136
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:54,769
The model drift management.

137
00:10:54,909 --> 00:11:01,029
We continuously monitor all
the features across these 847

138
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,989
model parameters Crossing 2.

139
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,399
8 million predictions per hour.

140
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:11,304
We do a real time evaluation which
allows us to achieve 99 accuracy in

141
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:15,834
the drift detection with immediate
response to the performance regression.

142
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:19,449
We process these distributions across
different sliding window anywhere

143
00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:27,259
from one hour to 90 days which allows
us to have more defined path or more

144
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:32,804
defined way to identify and define
the accuracy and also detect the

145
00:11:32,804 --> 00:11:35,354
false positive or the fraudulent data.

146
00:11:35,854 --> 00:11:40,104
We also do A B testing, where we
utilize the 12 parallel valuation

147
00:11:40,114 --> 00:11:42,304
groups, each of them processing 2.

148
00:11:42,304 --> 00:11:47,004
7 million transactions daily, which
allows us to come up with the newer

149
00:11:47,224 --> 00:11:52,774
detection and enable us to do the
deployments in both A B fashion.

150
00:11:53,274 --> 00:11:57,594
In conclusion, our revolutionary
AI powered risk scoring system

151
00:11:57,664 --> 00:12:01,884
has transformed the e commerce
detection by processing 4.

152
00:12:01,885 --> 00:12:03,309
2 terabytes of transaction data.

153
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:07,909
hourly with 99 percent
accuracy in drift detection.

154
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:12,859
By combining reinforcement learning
with Bayesian network, we have created

155
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:19,599
a solution that not only detects frauds
at a very unprecedented precision,

156
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:25,009
but also scales dynamically to handle
growing transaction volumes while

157
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:28,719
maintaining a superior performance matrix.

158
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:34,299
We're able to do an adaptive security,
where we are able to advanced Risk

159
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:37,849
assessment system in which you can
automatically calibrate the security

160
00:12:37,849 --> 00:12:42,139
levels keeping the system up and
also reducing the customer friction

161
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,739
We have improved the accuracy.

162
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:48,349
So we have achieved 47 increase
in the fraud detection precision

163
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:50,359
while maintaining a low 0.

164
00:12:50,989 --> 00:12:57,029
3 percent false positive rate Which
protects both the merchants and

165
00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:02,179
the customers We have enhanced the
transaction processing time to sub 220

166
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:10,809
milliseconds response time and handled
1, 892 concurrent transactions with

167
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:13,139
close to zero degradation in the system.

168
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:19,059
And our system is future ready
in the sense where we are able to

169
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:21,999
self optimize the system monitors.

170
00:13:22,774 --> 00:13:30,824
monitor the 3847 features across
these 87847 model parameters, ensuring

171
00:13:30,824 --> 00:13:36,354
us to continuously adapt to the new
emerging fraud patterns, allowing us

172
00:13:36,394 --> 00:13:41,204
to keep in sync with the newer fraud
patterns that have been emerging

173
00:13:41,374 --> 00:13:43,344
and able to take action accordingly.

174
00:13:43,844 --> 00:13:44,504
Thank you all.

175
00:13:45,154 --> 00:13:46,664
Hope you like the presentation.
