1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,820
Hey everyone and welcome and thanks
a lot for being here with me.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:08,480
so I'm Amanda Hunter and I'm a
digital marketer with a real love for

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,100
blending technology and creativity.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,749
And I especially love building
web experiences for IOT products.

5
00:00:16,114 --> 00:00:21,555
Now, I know IOT can feel like a buzzword
that we just really throw around, but at

6
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:26,484
its core, it's all about making our lives
easier and connecting everything from

7
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,854
the thermostats to our coffee makers.

8
00:00:29,144 --> 00:00:30,235
but let's be real.

9
00:00:30,344 --> 00:00:32,855
These products can also be intimidating.

10
00:00:33,174 --> 00:00:36,809
So if you've ever opened a box and
stared at the manual and thought,

11
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:38,660
Oh, this is really annoying.

12
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,260
I don't want to deal with this today.

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,839
Then So my goal today is to show you
how we can take that annoying note

14
00:00:44,849 --> 00:00:48,769
moment and turn it into something
more wow, this is really easy.

15
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,639
And spoiler alert, it all
starts with a great website.

16
00:00:53,139 --> 00:00:55,909
So let's kick things off with a question.

17
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:00,319
Why is web such a game
changer for IOT adoption?

18
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:03,859
And here's the thing, IOT is incredible.

19
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:06,329
It's like magic in the form of tech.

20
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:09,024
Your thermostat learns your
habits, your light comes on.

21
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:12,964
sync with your mood, and your fridge
tells you when you're out of oat milk.

22
00:01:13,234 --> 00:01:17,024
But let's be honest, in
all its brilliance, IoT can

23
00:01:17,024 --> 00:01:19,084
also be really complicated.

24
00:01:19,564 --> 00:01:23,794
And it's not just about getting your
devices to talk to each other, it's about

25
00:01:23,794 --> 00:01:26,334
making them a seamless part of your life.

26
00:01:26,604 --> 00:01:28,144
And it's not always easy.

27
00:01:28,394 --> 00:01:33,214
Devices sometimes don't connect,
settings that don't always save, and

28
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:36,974
that apps that almost feel like they're
written in another language can make

29
00:01:36,974 --> 00:01:41,489
us Give up before you've even really
started with this amazing technology.

30
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,639
So this is where web comes in.

31
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:48,569
It's the first stop on a user's journey,
whether they're researching a product,

32
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:53,029
trying to set it up, or figuring out
why their smart speaker won't just

33
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:58,369
stop saying, Hi, sorry, I didn't
quite get that, but let's face it.

34
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:03,274
When something isn't working, no one
pulls out that instruction manual anymore.

35
00:02:03,284 --> 00:02:04,824
It's probably already in the bin.

36
00:02:05,254 --> 00:02:06,794
They go straight to Google.

37
00:02:06,984 --> 00:02:11,074
So your website needs to be more
than just a pretty landing page.

38
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,349
It has to be an ultimate
guide where it's a place where

39
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:17,439
users can find clear answers.

40
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:22,919
They're easy to follow instructions there
and their confidence and to keep going.

41
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:26,749
And that's why web is such
a game changer for IOT.

42
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:31,039
It's where the relationship between
users and their devices can begin.

43
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,919
And if we get it right with that
great web experience, we can turn

44
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:37,659
curious visitors into confident users.

45
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:40,229
So let's explore in the
next couple of slides.

46
00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:41,774
How we can make that happen.

47
00:02:42,274 --> 00:02:42,904
All right.

48
00:02:42,984 --> 00:02:47,784
So let's talk about what makes
a web experience truly magical.

49
00:02:48,024 --> 00:02:50,474
And it all comes down to three things.

50
00:02:50,484 --> 00:02:52,214
First, it has to educate.

51
00:02:52,594 --> 00:02:57,454
It also has to be simple, and it also
has to build trust, and if we can nail

52
00:02:57,464 --> 00:03:01,354
down these three things, you're not
just creating a website, you're creating

53
00:03:01,354 --> 00:03:05,674
a space that feels like a supportive
and helpful friend to your users.

54
00:03:05,914 --> 00:03:10,384
So if we break that down a bit
further, we can look at So before

55
00:03:10,484 --> 00:03:14,984
anyone can love or even use your
IOT product, they need to understand

56
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,144
what it does and why it matters.

57
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:21,474
And this is where having simple,
digestible content comes in.

58
00:03:21,764 --> 00:03:24,504
Think bite sized, not brain surgery.

59
00:03:24,584 --> 00:03:25,524
Short videos?

60
00:03:25,724 --> 00:03:26,744
Yes, please.

61
00:03:26,984 --> 00:03:30,744
Show people that what your product
can do in 60 seconds or less.

62
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:31,854
FAQs?

63
00:03:32,054 --> 00:03:33,794
They can become your best friend.

64
00:03:34,044 --> 00:03:38,294
And make them clear, Concise and
make sure that they're covering

65
00:03:38,304 --> 00:03:42,194
users real concerns and not just
fill it up with marketing fluff.

66
00:03:42,194 --> 00:03:43,684
We have enough of that these days.

67
00:03:44,034 --> 00:03:49,204
Also, step by step guides can be an
absolute yes, and make them interactive,

68
00:03:49,414 --> 00:03:51,904
visual, or even gamified if possible.

69
00:03:51,924 --> 00:03:55,764
No one just wants to scroll through
a boring wall of text anymore.

70
00:03:56,064 --> 00:04:00,074
And I think the key here is
really to anticipate questions

71
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:01,294
before they're even asked.

72
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:06,859
So if your website truly answers those
questions effortlessly, users will feel

73
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:09,549
smart and more confident from the get go.

74
00:04:09,809 --> 00:04:12,049
Next, let's look at simplification.

75
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,629
So in your onboarding process
should feel easy that users barely

76
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:17,959
notice that they're learning.

77
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:21,974
If they're scratching their heads on
your website, or googling what this

78
00:04:21,984 --> 00:04:25,954
button is even for on a different
website, then we've already lost them.

79
00:04:25,984 --> 00:04:26,804
Not good.

80
00:04:27,074 --> 00:04:32,234
So two web experiences that I really like
to add to websites is having interactive

81
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:35,494
tutorials and also having virtual demos.

82
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:40,244
So interactive tutorials are like having
that friendly coach or that friendly

83
00:04:40,254 --> 00:04:45,114
best friend, or even the therapist
guiding you through a step how a

84
00:04:45,114 --> 00:04:49,729
guide on how to use your IOT product
and making sure Everything is simple.

85
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:54,789
And then virtual demos let you
try products you risk free.

86
00:04:55,324 --> 00:04:58,734
So they're like testing out a
smart gadget before it becomes

87
00:04:58,764 --> 00:05:00,304
even part of someone's life.

88
00:05:00,394 --> 00:05:01,324
Pretty cool, right?

89
00:05:01,644 --> 00:05:04,844
so when you simplify, you're not
just removing barriers, you're

90
00:05:04,844 --> 00:05:06,394
creating moments of delight.

91
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:12,594
And those aha moments when users feel like
everything clicks are what people keep

92
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,044
people engaged and coming back for more.

93
00:05:15,384 --> 00:05:17,534
so finally, let's talk about trust.

94
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:22,114
And I think this is where a lot of
IOT products trip up, to be honest.

95
00:05:22,944 --> 00:05:27,054
People love the idea of a smart
connected device, but they don't love

96
00:05:27,064 --> 00:05:31,834
the idea of their data being misused
or their privacy being compromised.

97
00:05:32,154 --> 00:05:37,524
And this is where transparency really
becomes a non negotiable on your website.

98
00:05:37,764 --> 00:05:41,224
So make sure that you're clear
and you're upfront about it.

99
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:44,344
Make sure you're clear about
what data you're collecting

100
00:05:44,354 --> 00:05:45,744
and why you're collecting it.

101
00:05:45,974 --> 00:05:47,964
Also, how you're protecting it.

102
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:52,274
So when users, know how to do this,
and also know how they can manage

103
00:05:52,314 --> 00:05:54,084
their privacy settings as well.

104
00:05:54,324 --> 00:05:56,204
And it's all about being consistent.

105
00:05:56,434 --> 00:06:01,594
So if your web experience is polished,
professional, easy to use, users will

106
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,444
assume that about your product too.

107
00:06:03,644 --> 00:06:08,074
On the flip side, if your site
feels clunky or outdated, it

108
00:06:08,074 --> 00:06:09,844
can clearly be a red flag.

109
00:06:10,064 --> 00:06:14,614
So when you build trust, you're not just
earning users, you're earning advocates.

110
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:18,324
And that's where people will not
only stick with your products, but

111
00:06:18,324 --> 00:06:20,374
recommend it to others as well.

112
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:21,564
All right.

113
00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:26,744
So let's talk about the secret
sauce to an amazing web experience.

114
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,984
And it includes three key ingredients.

115
00:06:30,214 --> 00:06:34,284
Personalization, interactivity,
and localization.

116
00:06:34,504 --> 00:06:38,714
When these three come together,
your website doesn't just inform,

117
00:06:38,824 --> 00:06:40,984
it connects and it engages.

118
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:43,344
So first is personalization.

119
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:46,554
And this is what, helps make
users feel like you're psyched.

120
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:48,079
was built just for them.

121
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:50,139
It's not just showing their name.

122
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:54,329
It's about serving up content and
recommendations that match their

123
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:56,599
specific needs and their preferences.

124
00:06:56,799 --> 00:07:01,759
So imagine landing on a site and thinking,
wow, this company totally gets me.

125
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:02,939
I really like it.

126
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:05,319
and that's the power of personalization.

127
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:07,939
It makes users feel seen and value.

128
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:10,959
The next ingredient we
have is interactivity.

129
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:16,919
Let's be honest, a static site can
be boring, but tools like live demo,

130
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:22,169
product configurations, quizzes can
make the experience dynamic and fun.

131
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,259
An example could be, being able
to visualize a product in your

132
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:30,709
own space through a virtual demo
or customize it before buying.

133
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:33,039
and it doesn't just
inform, it really expands.

134
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:36,654
sites and makes the product
feel real and quite magical.

135
00:07:36,904 --> 00:07:41,614
and interactivity keeps users engaged
and encourages them to explore your

136
00:07:41,614 --> 00:07:43,654
product and your product suites further.

137
00:07:43,874 --> 00:07:46,274
And then finally, we
have the localization.

138
00:07:46,564 --> 00:07:49,584
If your audience is global,
your site needs to feel it.

139
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,590
and it needs to feel local in all
your different markets and this isn't

140
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:58,670
just about translating the language
It's about adopting to the cultural

141
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:03,850
nuances imagery and even tone of the
website to match your different regions

142
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:08,880
So a site that's designed for spain
should feel distinctly spanish and not

143
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,080
just like it was that american site
Copy paste it into Google Translate.

144
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:18,020
And when you get personalization,
interactivity, and localization your

145
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,140
website becomes more than a platform.

146
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,480
It becomes a memorable experience
that resonates with every visitor.

147
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,480
Great.

148
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:32,020
So let's talk about the onboarding process
after someone buys your IoT product.

149
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:37,110
Because that's where we know the
magic or the disaster can happen.

150
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,600
So a smooth onboarding process can
be the difference between someone

151
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,075
saying this is the best product I ever
bought Or tossing your IOT product in

152
00:08:47,075 --> 00:08:49,505
the drawer and never seeing it again.

153
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:51,105
I really hope that doesn't happen.

154
00:08:51,335 --> 00:08:54,205
so how do we make the
onboarding process on the web?

155
00:08:54,515 --> 00:08:56,955
Not just functional, but fantastic.

156
00:08:57,145 --> 00:09:02,705
And it comes down to, again, some magic
ingredients of support tools, reducing

157
00:09:02,705 --> 00:09:05,235
that complexity, and boosting engagement.

158
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:07,995
So let's break these
things down a bit further.

159
00:09:08,195 --> 00:09:12,435
So first up, as I mentioned earlier,
guides and tutorials are amazing.

160
00:09:12,655 --> 00:09:17,215
And I'm not just talking about boring
50 page PDFs that no one wants to read.

161
00:09:17,485 --> 00:09:21,335
Think bite sized, step by step
instructions that feel like your

162
00:09:21,335 --> 00:09:26,145
helpful friend, or that therapist, or a
coach walking you through the process.

163
00:09:26,395 --> 00:09:31,470
Video guides are amazing,
interactive tutorials even better.

164
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,960
And the goal here is to make setups
so straightforward that users barely

165
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,350
realize that they're learning.

166
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,030
They click, they follow along, boom!

167
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,580
They're up and running, and without
ever having to Google, why won't my

168
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,830
smart fridge connect to my Wi Fi?

169
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:46,680
Then, they're done.

170
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:53,190
We also have AI, hello AI, we love AI,
AI chatbots, for personalized support.

171
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,290
let's talk about AI chatbots.

172
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,080
They're like the superheroes
of support nowadays.

173
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,290
I absolutely love them.

174
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:03,720
They're available 24 7 and they
don't get tired or frustrated.

175
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,500
And they're shockingly good at
answering user specific questions fast.

176
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,010
picture this, a user is stuck
setting up their smart thermostat.

177
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,380
At 11 p.

178
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:14,660
m.

179
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,130
Instead of throwing in the towel
they hop on your site and ask the

180
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:23,560
chatbot Why isn't this working and
they get instant personalized help?

181
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:30,390
It's like having tech export experts on
speed dial and it not only solves problems

182
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:35,310
quickly It also builds confidence in your
users So they feel supported and they're

183
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,480
more likely to stick with your product.

184
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,790
And then finally, let's
look at reducing complexity.

185
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,840
So let's be real.

186
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,630
IoT products can be intimidating.

187
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,930
And if your onboarding process looks
like it requires an engineering degree,

188
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,790
people are just going to bounce.

189
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,710
No, they're not going to be interested.

190
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,520
So reducing complexity is everything.

191
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,930
Simplifying the setup process
so it feels intuitive.

192
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,000
Make sure that you're
using clear language.

193
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,210
and also remove any fluff
or any unnecessary steps.

194
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,740
And, also anticipate where
users might be getting stuck.

195
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,170
So it's all about minimizing
that frustration on your, and

196
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,690
making that information clear.

197
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:18,210
So you're maximizing those
aha, woohoo, great moments that

198
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,620
just click with your users.

199
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,170
and then, yeah, sorry, I thought that
was the last point, but let's look

200
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,130
into boosting engagement as well.

201
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,640
Sorry, one more in there.

202
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,730
bit of a, Bit of a boost as well.

203
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,810
So now there were things that,
this is where I think things

204
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,130
are really getting exciting.

205
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,670
When you nail onboarding, you're not
just solving for an immediate problem,

206
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,160
you're laying down the foundation
for long term engagement and loyalty.

207
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,330
And when users feel like they bastard
the setup process, they're way more

208
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:52,570
likely to keep exploring your products
and recommending it to others.

209
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,440
And they're not just using
it, they're loving it.

210
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,580
And that's the ultimate goal, right?

211
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,270
An onboarding experience that
doesn't just encourage adoption,

212
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,930
it creates lifelong fans.

213
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,760
so to sum it up, onboarding isn't
just about getting users through the

214
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,890
door or even looking at your website.

215
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,770
It's about making their first
experience on your site and with your

216
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,300
product enjoyable and empowering.

217
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,970
And these are, with the right
tools, focus on simplicity.

218
00:12:20,325 --> 00:12:22,175
And an emphasis on engagement.

219
00:12:22,205 --> 00:12:24,945
You can turn your head,
even the most hesitant users

220
00:12:25,185 --> 00:12:26,875
into your biggest advocates.

221
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:31,805
Okay, so that was a lot of theory and
I feel like now it's a good time to

222
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:36,885
go into some real world examples of
brands that I feel can get it right.

223
00:12:37,165 --> 00:12:39,190
So let's take a look at Nest.

224
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:43,410
So we've all heard of Nest, love
Nest, and, they've really redefined

225
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,830
their onboarding experience,
for their smart thermostats.

226
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,780
one of the biggest hurdles
with IoT is the setup process.

227
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,050
I think we all know that.

228
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,810
and it can feel intimidating, even
for, the most tech savvy users.

229
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:01,110
So Nest solves this by offering
interactive tools on their websites.

230
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,500
Love a good website.

231
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,340
And this guide users.

232
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:08,065
This, provides users with
step by step thorough, guides

233
00:13:08,075 --> 00:13:09,545
for thorough installation.

234
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:14,035
And these tools aren't just about
showing what you do, they actively help

235
00:13:14,075 --> 00:13:16,495
their users understand how to do it.

236
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:20,820
For example, their app walks
through how to identify a user.

237
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,980
existing thermostat wiring and
connecting their new Nest device

238
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,240
and how to set it up on your Wi Fi.

239
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,800
And it's hands on and intuitive,
meaning users don't need the experts

240
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,340
to feel confident in the process.

241
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,850
And what's even better is Nest goes beyond
by just helping you install their device.

242
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,840
Their tools also show you how to
optimize the thermostat for energy

243
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,230
efficiency and sustainability and this
might explain, they also explain how

244
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,050
you can use things like eco mode or
suggest schedules based on your habits.

245
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,460
And it isn't just about functionality.

246
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,760
It's about really empowering the users
to get the most out of the device.

247
00:14:02,055 --> 00:14:05,985
Day one looking at their website
being able to figure it out And the

248
00:14:06,005 --> 00:14:11,065
result is a setup process that feels
approachable Not overwhelming and a

249
00:14:11,065 --> 00:14:14,005
product that delivers immediate value.

250
00:14:14,055 --> 00:14:18,505
I love nest as I just said so nest
Has this approach that shows us that

251
00:14:18,505 --> 00:14:24,485
simplifying complexity is not just helpful
It's a it's essential to driving adoption

252
00:14:24,505 --> 00:14:31,405
and user satisfaction And another great
example we have is philips hue and I

253
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:35,255
think this is awesome these lights now,
especially when it gets dark at 4 p.

254
00:14:35,255 --> 00:14:35,405
m.

255
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:38,105
It's great to have some
colorful mood lighting here

256
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:39,645
it's just been amazing as well.

257
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:45,605
So really like this product as well So if
we just talk about philip You for a minute

258
00:14:45,645 --> 00:14:50,975
and how they've added a seriously cool,
immersive twist to choosing lighting.

259
00:14:50,985 --> 00:14:56,145
So instead of just showing you pictures
and throwing technical specs at you, they

260
00:14:56,145 --> 00:15:00,445
let you visualize how on their website,
how their lights will look in your home.

261
00:15:00,705 --> 00:15:03,625
Even before you buy it's
an amazing virtual demo.

262
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:07,615
I suggest you go and try it it feels like
trying clothes in a fitting room, but

263
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:12,895
it's with living room lights you want to
see how that cozy warm glow feels in your

264
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:17,085
space or you know What bright daylight
can do to your productivity corner?

265
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:20,815
You can just really go on their site
and experiment and play around until

266
00:15:20,815 --> 00:15:25,040
you get the really Just the right
ambiance for your mood as well.

267
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,390
and this just isn't just about
selling a product to them It's about

268
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:33,200
removing all the guesswork and making
the experience feel personal and fun

269
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,410
And here's the genius part about it.

270
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,080
Philips hue doesn't just
stop at functionality.

271
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:46,210
They support making users feel supported
Confident and genuinely excited about

272
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,350
their product and their in their choices.

273
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,080
I genuinely excited about it Now I want
to go and buy some of these lights And

274
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:58,960
I think it's a perfect example of how to
A great onboarding isn't just practical.

275
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:02,700
It's emotional and when you
empower users to create something

276
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,670
that feels uniquely Theirs is not
just about offering a product.

277
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:12,430
You're offering a great awesome
experience as well Okay So now let's

278
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,740
geek out for a second and talk about what
makes all of this IOT magic possible.

279
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,600
And there are three big
players here behind the scenes.

280
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:27,480
We have, of course, AI, then we
also have AR and VR, and then,

281
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,780
of course, cloud infrastructure.

282
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:35,210
And together, they create web experiences
that feel seamless and almost magical.

283
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:39,670
So first we have AI, and this
is the brains of the operation.

284
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:44,860
AI personalizes the user experience by
learning what people like, what they

285
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:50,160
click on, and what they ignore, and even
how they interact With the iot products

286
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:54,710
and also with your website So it's really
like having a mind reader built into

287
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,930
the website and serving up exactly what
your users want From their information

288
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:04,870
and their onboarding Even before they
know what they want and also we have

289
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:10,890
ar and vr and these technologies create
an immersive Interactive demos that let

290
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:16,065
users try before they buy So imagine
being able to you know You we talked

291
00:17:16,075 --> 00:17:19,025
about it with the hue lights But you
could also do this with having a piece

292
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:22,895
of furniture and how you'd like it to
look in your living room Or house, the

293
00:17:22,895 --> 00:17:27,525
smart light can really change the mood of
your space from all these screens while

294
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:31,305
you're just like hanging out at home
and again, it's engaging it's fun and

295
00:17:31,305 --> 00:17:36,010
it really removes that uncertainty about
buying a new and quite expensive product.

296
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,770
and finally, there's cloud infrastructure.

297
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:43,060
And this is the unsung hero that keeps
everything up and running smoothly.

298
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:47,530
And it ensures that even if millions
of users are on your platform

299
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,150
at the same time, there are no
slowdowns, there's no crashes,

300
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,530
and no frustrating loading scenes.

301
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:58,045
And these things, when these three
a technology aspects work together.

302
00:17:58,195 --> 00:18:02,275
The result is a web experience
and an IOT product that feels

303
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:04,285
effortless and intuitive.

304
00:18:04,435 --> 00:18:08,095
Like everything, it's just
working exactly how it should.

305
00:18:08,475 --> 00:18:12,640
and it isn't just about what kind
of experience we want as users.

306
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:13,750
Isn't this what we want?

307
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,310
and of course, finally.

308
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,830
It's not all rainbows and sunshine.

309
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,560
There are real challenges
in these experiences.

310
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:28,100
First, handling user data
is a big responsibility.

311
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,570
and it's huge because trust can
be built or completely broken.

312
00:18:32,715 --> 00:18:36,645
based on how you manage privacy
and second, unfortunately, there

313
00:18:36,645 --> 00:18:39,775
are a lot of development costs
when it comes to IOT products.

314
00:18:39,775 --> 00:18:44,205
So building amazing experiences
isn't cheap and it takes

315
00:18:44,265 --> 00:18:46,105
a significant investment.

316
00:18:46,345 --> 00:18:49,515
And then finally, of course,
there's that level of scalability.

317
00:18:49,715 --> 00:18:53,345
So what works perfect for 10 users
might collapse when you have it

318
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:57,185
for 10, 000, millions, or maybe
even billions at some point.

319
00:18:57,475 --> 00:19:00,660
here's the thing, like with
everything, And These are challenges.

320
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,870
They're not excuses not to get started.

321
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,760
They are opportunities.

322
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,280
And if you're really motivated and
excited, you can make it happen.

323
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,990
So just make sure that
you're tackling them head on.

324
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,310
And you're not just solving problems.

325
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,950
You're setting yourselves up as
a confident leader in your space.

326
00:19:17,475 --> 00:19:23,015
I'm at the end, and let's just wrap up
with a few best practices to keep in mind

327
00:19:23,335 --> 00:19:28,175
when creating exceptional user experiences
for your IoT products on the web.

328
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:32,395
So first, I'd say, listen and iterate.

329
00:19:32,665 --> 00:19:35,755
So your user is your
best source of insight.

330
00:19:36,115 --> 00:19:39,895
Pay attention to their feedback
and keep improving based on

331
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:40,985
what they're telling you.

332
00:19:41,215 --> 00:19:45,395
The best experiences are built
over time, not all at once.

333
00:19:45,465 --> 00:19:47,205
Second, let's keep it clear.

334
00:19:47,435 --> 00:19:50,425
Simplicity is your
superpower, so avoid it.

335
00:19:50,585 --> 00:19:53,025
jargon, and complicated explanations.

336
00:19:53,305 --> 00:19:57,135
The goal is to make everything as
easy to understand as possible.

337
00:19:57,425 --> 00:20:00,325
No one should need a manual
just to navigate your site.

338
00:20:00,555 --> 00:20:03,195
And third, accessibility is key.

339
00:20:03,515 --> 00:20:05,755
It's a great experience.

340
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:09,035
we need that great experience
to work for everyone.

341
00:20:09,435 --> 00:20:14,445
And this means designing for different
abilities, devices, and needs.

342
00:20:14,485 --> 00:20:17,045
So no one feels left out or frustrated.

343
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:21,625
And the truth is, it's not just about
launching something perfect right away.

344
00:20:21,865 --> 00:20:25,445
It's about building something
that can grow, it can adapt,

345
00:20:25,495 --> 00:20:27,185
and it can evolve over time.

346
00:20:27,395 --> 00:20:30,735
And when you focus on these best
practices, you're setting yourself

347
00:20:30,735 --> 00:20:33,445
up for definitely long term success.

348
00:20:33,995 --> 00:20:38,615
In conclusion, just to wrap everything
up, the future of IoT isn't just

349
00:20:38,645 --> 00:20:43,475
about cool gadgets, it's about the
experiences we build around them.

350
00:20:43,655 --> 00:20:48,415
an amazing web experience that's user
friendly, engaging, and intuitive

351
00:20:48,445 --> 00:20:52,725
can really take IoT from, do I
really need this product, to yes,

352
00:20:52,765 --> 00:20:54,955
I can't imagine my life without it.

353
00:20:55,235 --> 00:20:58,245
And the IoT revolution
is already happening.

354
00:20:58,515 --> 00:21:03,675
And it's on us to make these technologies
accessible, seamless, and why not?

355
00:21:03,685 --> 00:21:05,315
Try and make it a little fun too.

356
00:21:05,605 --> 00:21:09,145
And when users feel empowered
and excited, adoption isn't

357
00:21:09,145 --> 00:21:10,995
just easier, it's inevitable.

358
00:21:11,235 --> 00:21:12,805
so that sums it up for today.

359
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:16,445
I hope you enjoyed the talk
and learned a little bit.

360
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:21,735
And I'd love to connect and speak
more about web experiences and IoT.

361
00:21:21,755 --> 00:21:23,725
So thank you so much,
and speak to you soon.

362
00:21:23,735 --> 00:21:24,185
Bye bye.
