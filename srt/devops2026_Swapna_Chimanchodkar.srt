1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,430
Speaker 43: Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:03,040
My name is Ker.

3
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:08,980
I am an alumni of Usman City and
currently A-I-E-E-E Senior member.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:16,200
The topic that I have today is about
DevOps pipelines for clinical AI that

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,870
is deploying real-time sepsis detection.

6
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:27,110
Now, why is sepsis a challenge and why
are we looking at the DevOps solution?

7
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:33,340
Sepsis, as you may be aware,
is a global healthcare crisis.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,290
It claims approximately 11
million lives, which is, 20% of

9
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,270
all the mortality that we have.

10
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,330
What more, with every hour that's
gone, the chances of mortality

11
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,250
increases by approximately 8%.

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,280
So with the impact and the time
criticality, the question here would be,

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,460
can technology help in reducing these?

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,500
The answer pretty positive, yes.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,210
When combined with process
and digital transformation,

16
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,190
it can, AI can improve the.

17
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:15,450
Clinical outcomes when embedded into the
redesigned care workflows and supported

18
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,700
by reliable, always on platform.

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,160
In these high risk settings,
we are talking about lives.

20
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:31,510
Modern dev ops and ML ops capabilities
can ensure speed, reliability,

21
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,840
observability, and zero downtime.

22
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:41,030
These are strategic enablers that
ensure insights reach clinicals.

23
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,790
At the moment, decisions have to
be taken this translating analytics

24
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,630
into measurable reduction and
preventable harm from sepsis.

25
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:56,530
So with this context, again, we are
seeing sepsis, a major healthcare crisis,

26
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,680
time criticality, really important.

27
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,150
If you don't have data, if
it's in buckets, if it's in

28
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,690
different ways, different sources,
it's going to cause problems.

29
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,300
And if there is downtime,
you're losing time.

30
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,220
And what is the impact here?

31
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,610
You're talking about lives
and every hour is impactful.

32
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,690
So it's very important that you
give this data at the right time.

33
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,730
Now coming to the phase wherein we
are trying to get everything done.

34
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,255
But does this is it easy in terms
of implementing of course not.

35
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:30,345
It comes with its own complexities.

36
00:02:31,095 --> 00:02:35,535
So what are some of the
complexities you're talking about?

37
00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:38,265
You're talking about
distributed healthcare systems.

38
00:02:38,765 --> 00:02:45,935
You may have vendor systems, you may have
legacy electronic healthcare records, and

39
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:49,835
you also need real time streaming of data.

40
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:54,655
And that is through the data pipelines
that we have spoken about and.

41
00:02:55,465 --> 00:02:57,835
This, of course, has to be very reliable.

42
00:02:57,835 --> 00:03:02,045
You cannot have errors, so it should be
able to get data from all the pipelines.

43
00:03:02,045 --> 00:03:07,755
And then what it needs to do is get into
a model, which should be, which you should

44
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:09,585
be, there should be validation for it.

45
00:03:09,585 --> 00:03:11,835
And of course, compliance
is the key thing, right?

46
00:03:11,835 --> 00:03:14,745
And while you're doing all this, it's
very critical that you maintain audit

47
00:03:14,745 --> 00:03:16,395
history from regulatory perspective.

48
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:18,815
Now, coming again to the concept of.

49
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,750
You also have to have a
process in place, right?

50
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,600
You may have the data, but it
should also be embedded into

51
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,940
clinical and operational frameworks.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,260
So you have the data, but then,
if you're not taking the data,

53
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,300
if there is no process and
actions are not taken at the at.

54
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,050
Based on all of this, then it's of no use.

55
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,220
So it should be used.

56
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:45,850
And the workflow should be embedded with
this aligned real time data that comes to

57
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,925
the pipeline and helps in decision making.

58
00:03:48,425 --> 00:03:53,115
So with that challenges in mind,
are there any things that can any

59
00:03:53,215 --> 00:03:56,865
you know, platform engineering
patterns to address these challenges?

60
00:03:57,345 --> 00:04:01,645
This slide talks to that some of
the things that could be done is

61
00:04:01,695 --> 00:04:07,685
the Kubernetes orchestration, which
will help in autoscaling and health

62
00:04:07,685 --> 00:04:12,695
checks for distributed hospital
networks to t prediction services.

63
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:18,085
Then you have CICD with clinical gates,
which is basically continuous integration

64
00:04:18,085 --> 00:04:24,275
and continuous deployment because you
want to have validations, you want to

65
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:27,905
see how the performance is, and if there
is any bias, you want to detect that.

66
00:04:27,905 --> 00:04:30,755
So there is always a need for
continuous integration and

67
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:32,945
continuous deployment of of.

68
00:04:33,245 --> 00:04:36,695
Data will basically automated
pipelines, again, coming to the

69
00:04:36,695 --> 00:04:38,405
pipelines, why it's so important.

70
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:44,385
Observability framework so that
you monitor prediction, accuracy,

71
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:48,885
latency, data quality, real time
alerting for model drift or issues.

72
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:55,275
Infrastructure as a code, which enables
to provision, manage and recover

73
00:04:55,365 --> 00:05:00,525
secure, compliant and highly reliable
IT infrastructure through automated

74
00:05:00,525 --> 00:05:05,055
version control code, directly supporting
patient safety and clinical operations.

75
00:05:05,985 --> 00:05:10,555
And the last important thing
is basically SRE, which is site

76
00:05:10,705 --> 00:05:12,865
reliability engineering for healthcare.

77
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,315
And it's.

78
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:19,535
It's really critical to ensure
highly reliable, safe, compliant,

79
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:25,655
and continuous availability when
there are downtime also or errors

80
00:05:25,655 --> 00:05:28,355
can directly impact the patients.

81
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:31,025
So it's very important
from that perspective.

82
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:36,660
So we again looked at the sepsis
as a impact, how important

83
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,235
it is to have timely data.

84
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:42,505
We looked at how technology can
help ensure the downtime is not

85
00:05:42,565 --> 00:05:44,875
there and get you everything.

86
00:05:45,755 --> 00:05:46,625
It'll be accurate.

87
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,095
Now, how do you do that?

88
00:05:48,095 --> 00:05:49,865
You need to have pipelines.

89
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:53,855
And we saw some of the challenges
that you, it's not just the

90
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:57,065
hospital, but you may have vendor
systems like labs, et cetera.

91
00:05:57,455 --> 00:05:59,765
You might have some
data on legacy systems.

92
00:05:59,765 --> 00:06:03,665
You may also need to integrate
data from various sources.

93
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:07,625
And then as we went through all
those challenges, we needed to

94
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,245
have models which required to be.

95
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:11,935
Continuously validated.

96
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:15,955
And then we looked at some of
these tools which can help address

97
00:06:15,955 --> 00:06:22,445
the challenges which includes the
Kubernetes orchestration, CICD, which

98
00:06:22,445 --> 00:06:25,715
is again, continuous integration
and deployment with clinical Gates

99
00:06:26,215 --> 00:06:29,415
Observability framework, infrastructure
as a code and SRE for healthcare.

100
00:06:29,685 --> 00:06:32,385
And we'll go through some of
these in the following topics as

101
00:06:32,385 --> 00:06:33,795
we go through the slides as well.

102
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:35,375
Coming back now.

103
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:39,185
So to be able to have that kind
of CLI cloud infrastructure for

104
00:06:39,185 --> 00:06:40,805
realtime patient monitoring, right?

105
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,485
Real time is what we want to do.

106
00:06:43,055 --> 00:06:47,885
We needed to have a processing timeline,
which is basic pipeline, sorry, I'm sorry.

107
00:06:47,885 --> 00:06:49,115
Processing pipeline.

108
00:06:49,145 --> 00:06:53,395
Which, which was a key thing
that we discussed so far as well.

109
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:57,995
And what that means is that there
should be cloud native architecture.

110
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,640
Process that processes real time
vitals of the patient, things like

111
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:09,680
heart rate, blood pressure lab
values, even driven microservices.

112
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:16,790
These ensure sub-second latency for
clinical critical clinical interventions.

113
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,260
And then when you're talking
about integration, again, we

114
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,340
looked at it slightly previously.

115
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,790
We are talking about automated clinical
workflows are triggered for clinical

116
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:33,370
events like sepsis alerting care teams and
suggesting diagnostic protocols, right?

117
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,430
You want them to be given
some kind of instructions and

118
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,690
whatever could help we do it.

119
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,300
And then comprehensive audit
trials is another thing that

120
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,489
we spoke about previously also.

121
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:48,039
Coming back to streamlining data
pipelines and processing patient vitals.

122
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:53,159
Now some of the things that will help in
streamlining data, archite architectures

123
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:59,729
that process, continuous page patient
vital science with minimal latency.

124
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:05,179
How some technologies like Apache Kafka
and cloud services es data from monitors,

125
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:07,069
lab systems and nursing platforms.

126
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:11,769
What more these platforms can
perform future feature engineering.

127
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,739
Aggregation and data enrichment
from the EHR integration.

128
00:08:16,739 --> 00:08:19,589
Before AI models even interface.

129
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:25,849
They are designed to handle variable
patterns, internet and network

130
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:27,994
connectivity, and ensure data accuracy.

131
00:08:28,494 --> 00:08:29,544
Very critical, right?

132
00:08:29,544 --> 00:08:32,574
Because again, when you're consolidating
data, these are all real time

133
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:33,895
issues that you're talking about.

134
00:08:33,895 --> 00:08:37,824
You could have data coming from different
sources with different data patterns.

135
00:08:37,824 --> 00:08:40,645
There could be network issues
there, and we have to ensure that

136
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,984
there is data accuracy because
we are talking about lives.

137
00:08:43,484 --> 00:08:48,044
Robust mechanisms like back pressure
management, product downstream services,

138
00:08:48,044 --> 00:08:53,515
and maintain responsiveness during peak
time and peak demands and critical events.

139
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:54,745
That's super critical.

140
00:08:55,245 --> 00:09:02,285
Then we spoke about EHR integration,
which is electronic health record to

141
00:09:02,285 --> 00:09:06,810
be able to diagnose and cure a patient
if you don't have the health record.

142
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,030
It's going to lose a lot of time
because firstly, you wouldn't be

143
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,439
able to take the right decision
about the patient's health condition.

144
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:19,420
And then second thing would be
that it would be also you would

145
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,300
lose out a lot of time, which is
again, major challenge about sepsis.

146
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,310
We have already covered that before.

147
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:31,790
So electronic health record integration
is, as foundational for clinical ai

148
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,709
navigating diverse platforms with
proprietary data model and vari standards.

149
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:37,415
So what are we talking about?

150
00:09:37,415 --> 00:09:39,015
We are talking about data extraction.

151
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:41,685
That's critical from all these systems.

152
00:09:42,175 --> 00:09:47,814
It could be done via HHL seven
FH IR APIs or custom interfaces.

153
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:50,064
Then you need to
normalize the data, right?

154
00:09:50,064 --> 00:09:53,744
You could have things which
are basically just not

155
00:09:53,744 --> 00:09:55,214
representative of the right thing.

156
00:09:55,664 --> 00:09:59,174
So transforming all this
heterogeneous data into standard

157
00:09:59,174 --> 00:10:01,454
formats, handing terminology.

158
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:07,819
And missing values because what if,
you had say one day when somebody's

159
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:13,800
BP was 300 and usually his BP or her
BP is only 80, then you don't want

160
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,930
it to consider just one day, right?

161
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,110
You want to consider, but you don't
want to say average it out or something.

162
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,970
So you would still have the
data point, but you would.

163
00:10:21,035 --> 00:10:26,195
Try to normalize the data to be a two
representation, and then you would have

164
00:10:26,195 --> 00:10:30,535
quality validation which is basically
you would implement quality checks and

165
00:10:30,535 --> 00:10:33,245
monitoring for accurate model interface.

166
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:35,080
Now, we spoke about.

167
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,965
Again, sepsis as a concept of
some of the technology challenges,

168
00:10:39,965 --> 00:10:41,525
some things that will help us.

169
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:45,935
We spoke about, again, with respect
to pipelines, all of this that we

170
00:10:45,935 --> 00:10:50,945
covered is, it's very critical in
terms of the data and in terms of

171
00:10:50,945 --> 00:10:53,875
getting everything integrated properly.

172
00:10:53,935 --> 00:11:00,165
And now what are the different phases
that we have in implementing these, right?

173
00:11:00,235 --> 00:11:00,405
The first.

174
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:05,050
Phase would be the algorithm
development where models are

175
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,830
trained with retrospective data
optimized for sepsis detection.

176
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,750
So you would do the algorithm development.

177
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:15,580
Then based on the algorithm you would
also do a retrospective validation.

178
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,050
So you would do things like
rigorous validation of handout data

179
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,060
set across patient demographics.

180
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:26,260
And then you would do a shadow deployment
because you wanted to go slow and be

181
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:31,030
cautious, so you would do a shadow
development in terms of running the.

182
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:35,280
Shadow mode and then, generating
predictions without actu, without

183
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,500
actually doing the full scale deployment.

184
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,760
And then you would do clinical reviews in
terms of how the results are coming out.

185
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:46,620
You would do a canary release, which is
basically gradual release to small cohorts

186
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,070
with continuous adverse event monitoring
because you want to see how it's going.

187
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,670
And then you would go into full
production, which is basically

188
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:58,020
deployment across networks with ongoing
performance and drift detection.

189
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,785
So these would be the
phases that you would have.

190
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:04,515
As we do this, observability is
the most important thing, right?

191
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:10,115
You want to see how the data is
also performing in production.

192
00:12:10,615 --> 00:12:12,385
So you would, how would you do that?

193
00:12:12,595 --> 00:12:14,870
You would do that through things like.

194
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:19,930
You would do that through various things
like, prediction, performance metrics.

195
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:24,160
You would continuously assist
sensitivity, specificity, and alert rates.

196
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,780
You would have dashboards segment
performance to identify thrift across

197
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,430
demographics and clinical units.

198
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:35,200
You would have system latency
tracking which is basically monitoring

199
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,640
end-to-end latency from data
ingestion to client alert delivery.

200
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,640
And then you would define that would
also define acceptable thresholds

201
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,350
aligned with intervention windows.

202
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,710
So if you have some kind of
a threshold breach, then you

203
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,780
know how quickly it should be.

204
00:12:51,885 --> 00:12:52,485
Escalated.

205
00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:56,055
All that is what, and then the data
quality, you're talking about data,

206
00:12:56,055 --> 00:13:00,135
you're talking about pipelines, data,
qualities of paramount importance,

207
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:04,545
so automated detection of missing
values and data completeness issues.

208
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:08,655
Alerts trigger when the data quality
falls below the threshold is super key.

209
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:12,335
Now model drift detection
and continuous validation.

210
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:16,325
So you looked at observability
and then model drift detection

211
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:17,525
and continuous validation.

212
00:13:18,035 --> 00:13:23,075
Clinical AI models drift due to
evolving patient populations,

213
00:13:23,285 --> 00:13:25,475
practice change and seasonal shifts.

214
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:28,965
Continuous validations compels life.

215
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:34,170
Prediction distribution against baseline
training data using statistical tests

216
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,420
if drift breaches the threshold.

217
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,430
Automated retraining or data science
team investigation is triggered

218
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,410
feedback loop with actual clinical
outcomes enabled, supervised model

219
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:52,750
updates, improving prediction accuracy,
and ensuring regulatory compliance.

220
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:58,075
So we spoke about model detection, drift
detection, and continuous validation,

221
00:13:58,075 --> 00:14:03,625
and now we move into SRE practices
for life critical healthcare systems.

222
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:10,005
So what are some of the SRE practices
as error budgets for clinical ai

223
00:14:10,095 --> 00:14:15,705
That is defining acceptable failure
rates, aligning with clinical impacts,

224
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:21,585
sepsis detection as you can imagine
will have a higher detection system

225
00:14:21,585 --> 00:14:24,615
and the target is about 99.95.

226
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:28,905
Uptime with strict latency
percentiles balancing innovation.

227
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:36,170
Velocity against reliability requirements,
incident response protocols, structured

228
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:42,290
on-call procedures with escalation path
to DevOps engineers, data scientists

229
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:46,480
and clinical informatics team run
book's, document common failure

230
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,430
scenarios and remediation steps.

231
00:14:49,165 --> 00:14:51,055
And then blameless postmortem.

232
00:14:51,745 --> 00:14:56,305
Learning from incidents through
detailed root cause analysis focuses

233
00:14:56,305 --> 00:15:01,615
on focusing on system improvements
rather than individual faults.

234
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:07,340
Documentation feeds continuous improvement
of infrastructure and processes.

235
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,690
Yeah, that's the last phase and it's
super critical because whenever there's

236
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,880
something that goes wrong, we don't blame.

237
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,260
We sit down, we think about it, what
the root cause was, and we try to

238
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,360
improve continuously because that's how.

239
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,040
Things get better.

240
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:27,440
Having said that, once you have done all
the deployment, you have been thorough,

241
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,900
you have continuously validated.

242
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,870
It's definitely going to help save
time and take decisions quickly, but

243
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,760
we just don't stop at where we are.

244
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,145
So we would just continue
with the blameless postmortem

245
00:15:40,185 --> 00:15:41,980
and will continuously evolve.

246
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,700
Now, as you can see, we are moving from
a reactive to a proactive clinical care.

247
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,880
We are not doing things where.

248
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,060
Things have gone extremely
wrong, thankfully.

249
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,430
And we are trying to be as
proactive as possible, right?

250
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,560
And the criticality is immense.

251
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:03,200
So as you can see, modern DevOp
practices are transforming healthcare

252
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,935
from reactive treatment to proactive
care, enabling earlier intervention with

253
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:13,695
real time predictive analytics in areas
in the area, in various areas, right?

254
00:16:13,715 --> 00:16:15,695
And here we're talking
about sepsis detection.

255
00:16:16,195 --> 00:16:22,945
This approach prevents severe outcomes and
is crucial for any mission critical domain

256
00:16:23,695 --> 00:16:27,265
where reliability impacts human outcomes.

257
00:16:27,765 --> 00:16:31,515
Including fraud detection,
predictive maintenance, and

258
00:16:32,235 --> 00:16:33,885
auto autonomous vehicle systems.

259
00:16:34,635 --> 00:16:40,755
By applying cloud narrative architectures
and rigorous reliability, engineering

260
00:16:40,785 --> 00:16:46,570
DevOps teams deliver practical clinical
impact at scale here because we are

261
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,130
not talking about just one patient.

262
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,150
It's the whole system.

263
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,785
And, if it's positive, how
many people it can help.

264
00:16:52,285 --> 00:16:56,455
So that brings us towards
the end of the presentation.

265
00:16:56,455 --> 00:17:04,255
Some of the key takeaways that we had of
is you have infrastructure as foundation.

266
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:07,945
You, we spoke about Kubernetes
streamlining and infrastructure

267
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:09,775
as a code, ensuring reliable.

268
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:14,565
Reproducible deployments
across healthcare networks.

269
00:17:15,065 --> 00:17:18,545
We said validation gates really do matter.

270
00:17:18,545 --> 00:17:21,995
Clinical validation, shadow
deployment, and canary releases.

271
00:17:21,995 --> 00:17:24,185
Pro protest, sorry, not protest.

272
00:17:24,185 --> 00:17:25,355
Pro protects us, right?

273
00:17:25,355 --> 00:17:29,360
It protects us against regressions,
enabling continuous improvement of

274
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,535
clinical algorithm observability
beyond uptime monitoring.

275
00:17:34,935 --> 00:17:39,825
Predictions, accuracy, latency
and data quality ensures clinical

276
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,715
utility and protects drift.

277
00:17:42,585 --> 00:17:44,475
Model drift before patient impact.

278
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:45,890
Very key.

279
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,820
And then reliability engineering, which
is the last topic that we touched upon.

280
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:55,530
Then sari practices like error,
budget, and incident response ensure

281
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:00,540
operational excellence protecting
patients from system failures.

282
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,540
That brings us to the
end of the presentation.

283
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,620
Thank you again.

284
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,050
Just to iterate my name again
is, and we can go ahead with

285
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,940
any questions from here on.

286
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:12,570
Thanks.
