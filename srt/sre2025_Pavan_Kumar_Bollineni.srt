1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,010
Hey.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,000
Hi everyone.

3
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:02,559
Welcome.

4
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,090
Thank you for joining me today.

5
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,750
In today's session we'll discuss how
SRE approach has transformed financial

6
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,190
operations by addressing system
latency, global access disparities,

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,350
and also reliability concerns.

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,930
Let's explore the key
strategies and results achieved

9
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,700
through this transformation.

10
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,880
So moving on the next one, what we
are looking at is the challenge.

11
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,280
So what are the challenges which
are, we are currently facing?

12
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,580
As part of the financial
systems which needed SRE.

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,270
So the first one, what we see
is unpredictable performance

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,740
during the financial close.

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,360
The system response time increases
drastically from an average of two

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,030
seconds to 30 seconds per transactions.

17
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:48,575
This latency caused delays in the
consolidation, financial statements

18
00:00:48,575 --> 00:00:52,235
leading to missing deadlines and
the increase in manual intervention.

19
00:00:52,715 --> 00:00:56,455
For instance, a finance team had
to wait for extended periods to

20
00:00:56,455 --> 00:01:00,864
complete each transaction, which
not only slowed down the entire

21
00:01:00,864 --> 00:01:06,209
process, but also led to overtime
work and increased operational costs.

22
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:10,769
So the second challenge, what we
see is global availability issues.

23
00:01:11,345 --> 00:01:15,035
Teams located in different regions
such as Asia and Europe, faced

24
00:01:15,035 --> 00:01:17,464
inconsistent access to financial systems.

25
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:22,265
For example, during the peak hours, users
in Asia frequently experienced a timeout,

26
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:26,884
some slowdown responses while users in
Europe did not face any such issues.

27
00:01:27,244 --> 00:01:31,994
This disparity in system availability,
the availability of the global

28
00:01:31,994 --> 00:01:36,434
teams to collaborate effectively and
maintain the continuous operation.

29
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:41,349
As a result critical financial processes
were delayed and overall efficiency

30
00:01:41,349 --> 00:01:43,299
of the organization was compromised.

31
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,589
So the next issue, what we
see is reliability concerns.

32
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:52,309
So the financial system experienced
unexpected outages particularly during the

33
00:01:52,309 --> 00:01:54,709
critical periods such as month end close.

34
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:58,669
These outages led to incomplete
data entries and disrupted

35
00:01:58,669 --> 00:02:02,660
financial workflows requiring ex
extensive manual reconciliation.

36
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:04,209
To correct errors.

37
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:07,719
For instance, a certain system
crash during the final stages of

38
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:12,099
financial reporting, causes data
loss and also inconsistencies.

39
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,279
Which took several days to resolve.

40
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,999
So the result in increasing in the
operational risk and reduce the

41
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:22,249
confidence among the stakeholders
and potential financial losses due to

42
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:24,349
delayed in reporting condition making.

43
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:29,804
So as an example, like in British Airways
in 2020 the the SAP outage was disrupted.

44
00:02:29,804 --> 00:02:33,734
The payroll and invoicing
cascading into 80 million losses.

45
00:02:34,234 --> 00:02:34,525
Okay.

46
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:35,239
Moving on.

47
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:39,729
The next one, what we are looking at is
Ari approach to finance transformation.

48
00:02:40,149 --> 00:02:43,979
So here here we are looking at
three different approaches how the

49
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:46,229
finance can transform this SRE.

50
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:51,149
So the first one, what we are looking is
reframe financial systems as services.

51
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:54,954
So the financial transactions and
reporting processes were treated as

52
00:02:54,954 --> 00:02:57,104
services with the defined reliability on.

53
00:02:57,249 --> 00:03:01,029
Performance targets and similar
to how how we customer facing

54
00:03:01,029 --> 00:03:02,139
applications are managed.

55
00:03:02,619 --> 00:03:07,999
So this swift in perspective ensures
that the financial system receive the

56
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:11,749
same level of attention and resources
as the other critical business

57
00:03:11,749 --> 00:03:16,039
services leading to improve the
reliability and also the performance.

58
00:03:16,814 --> 00:03:20,984
So the second approach, what we see
is a defined clear reliability target.

59
00:03:21,644 --> 00:03:24,284
Okay, let's say the, a certain example.

60
00:03:24,314 --> 00:03:26,744
Certain example, the set
service level object to.

61
00:03:26,744 --> 00:03:32,594
So of 99.99% of time for the financial
system, meaning it could only be down

62
00:03:32,594 --> 00:03:34,184
for approximately four minutes per month.

63
00:03:34,684 --> 00:03:38,194
This high standard insurance, that
system was almost always reliable,

64
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:39,664
reducing the risk of downtime.

65
00:03:40,164 --> 00:03:43,914
During the critical periods and
improving the overall user satisfaction.

66
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:52,404
So Visa sets their at 99.999% to align
it with the business critical operations,

67
00:03:52,674 --> 00:03:56,054
which will reduce overall system downtime.

68
00:03:56,624 --> 00:03:58,004
And reduce the latencies.

69
00:03:58,664 --> 00:04:02,124
So the next one, what next
approach, what we see is implement

70
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:03,474
a continuous measurement.

71
00:04:03,574 --> 00:04:07,114
Integrate real time monitoring tools,
so to track the system performance

72
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:11,854
and also user experience and
enable proactive issues protection.

73
00:04:12,004 --> 00:04:14,914
Enable proactive issue detection
through prevent a predictive

74
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:17,164
analysis and an anomaly detection.

75
00:04:17,714 --> 00:04:22,074
So continuous monitor monitoring
flags will increase in a PA response

76
00:04:22,074 --> 00:04:25,884
time prompting the system to
automatically scale up resources before,

77
00:04:26,274 --> 00:04:28,014
before user experience any delay.

78
00:04:28,524 --> 00:04:31,794
So proactive scaling maintains
performance standards and also

79
00:04:31,794 --> 00:04:33,824
prevent potential slowdowns.

80
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:38,124
So the next one, what we are looking
at is establishing financials, LO.

81
00:04:38,124 --> 00:04:41,094
So again, we are having four
different approaches here.

82
00:04:41,124 --> 00:04:43,974
The first one, what we see
is availability metrics.

83
00:04:44,604 --> 00:04:46,914
Ensure that critical functions just speak.

84
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:50,439
The lecturer updates or financial
reporting were almost always

85
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:53,109
available with the downtime,
less than four minutes per month.

86
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:57,259
This high availability targets
minimize the disruptions and ensures

87
00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:02,269
that finance teams could rely on the
system to complete their tasks on time.

88
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,899
Our next one, what we see is performances.

89
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:09,949
So set a performances where 95%
of the financial transactions

90
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:11,929
should complete within two seconds.

91
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,659
Ensuring quick and efficient
processing this target helps

92
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:19,079
maintaining a smooth workflow and
reduce the time finance teams.

93
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:22,039
Spent waiting for the
transactions to complete.

94
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:27,189
So the Coca-Cola mandated this two, two
second sub-process times for any S-A-P-F-I

95
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:29,799
transaction during the quarter closures.

96
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:34,679
So the next one, the third one, what we
are looking at is continuous refinement.

97
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:38,084
Every quarter the team should
review system performance data and

98
00:05:38,084 --> 00:05:41,729
not just the based on the observed
trends and also the business needs.

99
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:43,169
So ensuring that.

100
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:45,649
Continuous alignment with
the operational goals.

101
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:50,839
This regular review process allows
the teams to adapt and change

102
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:54,529
in requirements continuously
improve the system reliability.

103
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:57,929
The fourth one, what we look at
is business aligned Excel goals.

104
00:05:58,499 --> 00:06:02,099
So during month and close, the
Excel was for the availability

105
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:05,089
was increased to 99.999.

106
00:06:05,414 --> 00:06:11,024
5% allowing for only two minutes
of downtime to ensure smooth and

107
00:06:11,024 --> 00:06:13,164
uninterrupted financial operations.

108
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:18,314
So this higher target ensures that
system remained highly reliable during

109
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:21,939
the most critical periods reducing
the risk of delays and errors.

110
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:22,729
Okay.

111
00:06:22,784 --> 00:06:27,034
So the next one, what we are looking at
is automated monitoring and alerting.

112
00:06:27,314 --> 00:06:32,544
So the first one, what we we have three
different approaches how the system alert.

113
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:36,099
New alerts will be sent to
the financial processes.

114
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:39,399
So the first one, what we are
looking at is intelligent alerting.

115
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:44,539
So alerts for issues affecting month
and close processes, or prioritized over

116
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:49,279
less critical functions ensuring rapid
response and also high impact problems.

117
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:54,779
So this prioritization helps the teams
to focus on most critical issues first

118
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:56,969
that minimizes the business disruption.

119
00:06:57,689 --> 00:06:59,339
So the second one, what we see is.

120
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:00,564
Proactive detection.

121
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:05,414
So monitoring the tools monitoring tools
that detect detected increases the latency

122
00:07:05,814 --> 00:07:09,744
in transaction processing and alerts
the system before it affect the user.

123
00:07:09,744 --> 00:07:12,264
So following for primitive actions.

124
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:16,034
So this proactive approach helps
prevent issues from cascading and

125
00:07:16,034 --> 00:07:18,014
ensures a smooth user experience.

126
00:07:18,014 --> 00:07:21,974
So the next one, what we see is a
comprehensive coverage so monitored,

127
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:26,624
not just the system uptime and also
the performance, but also completion

128
00:07:26,624 --> 00:07:31,424
rates of the financial processes like
reconciliations and reporting generations.

129
00:07:31,964 --> 00:07:35,684
This comprehensive monitoring
approach provides a holistic view

130
00:07:35,684 --> 00:07:37,399
of system health and performance.

131
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:38,769
Okay, moving on.

132
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,099
The next one, what we are looking
at is incident response time.

133
00:07:42,489 --> 00:07:47,200
So in order to provide the response time,
so for the incidents to try to take care

134
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:48,829
we defined the three different topics.

135
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:49,555
Approaches.

136
00:07:49,705 --> 00:07:52,255
The first one is finance
specific playbooks.

137
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:56,345
So develop playbooks for common
issues like transaction failures

138
00:07:56,525 --> 00:08:00,935
and data inconsistencies, detailing
step by step resolution procedures,

139
00:08:01,445 --> 00:08:03,975
and escalating escalation parts.

140
00:08:04,185 --> 00:08:08,455
These playbooks provides clear
guidance for teams and ensures quick

141
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:10,015
and effective incident resolution.

142
00:08:10,515 --> 00:08:14,265
So the second one, what we see is
cross-functional response teams.

143
00:08:14,805 --> 00:08:19,185
So form form teams with both IT and
finance experts who could quickly

144
00:08:19,185 --> 00:08:23,585
diagnose and resolve the issues such as
finance experts identifying the impacts

145
00:08:23,585 --> 00:08:25,625
of system error on financial reporting.

146
00:08:25,735 --> 00:08:29,075
So this cross cross-functional
approach ensure that incidents

147
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:32,705
were addressed from both the
technical and business perspective.

148
00:08:32,955 --> 00:08:36,735
Then third important one
is blameless postmortems.

149
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:41,510
So after a system outage conducted a
postmortem to analyze and analyze root

150
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:46,455
causes and identify the improvements
focusing on process and system outages

151
00:08:46,455 --> 00:08:48,255
rather than blaming individuals.

152
00:08:48,855 --> 00:08:52,835
So this approach fostered a culture
of continuous improvement and also

153
00:08:52,835 --> 00:08:55,505
helps prevent similar issues in future.

154
00:08:56,005 --> 00:08:59,485
So the next one, what we are
looking at is a technical results.

155
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,045
So again, the number speaks.

156
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,525
So the first one the system availability.

157
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:08,625
So achieved near perfect uptime,
significantly reducing the downtime,

158
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,835
onur, continuous availability
of the financial system.

159
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:16,655
So this improvement enhance the
user confidence and also reduce

160
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:18,515
the risk of business disruption.

161
00:09:18,565 --> 00:09:23,820
Ana, an example, as SAP PS Fourna
Cloud achieved 99.99% of time for

162
00:09:24,055 --> 00:09:28,265
Luhan after migrating from ECC ECC 6.0.

163
00:09:28,925 --> 00:09:31,255
So previously it was at 97%.

164
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:36,295
The second one, what we see as a technical
results is the incident resolution.

165
00:09:36,685 --> 00:09:40,555
Reduce the average time to resolve the
incidents from four hours to one hour.

166
00:09:40,585 --> 00:09:42,415
Minimizing the business disruption.

167
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:47,835
This faster resolution time
include overall system reliability

168
00:09:47,925 --> 00:09:49,965
and also the user satisfaction.

169
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:54,275
So third point what we are
looking at as automation.

170
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:59,235
So within 90% of recovery process
procedures, were automated, human

171
00:09:59,235 --> 00:10:02,655
intervention is minimized, reducing the
error and also speed up the recovery.

172
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,470
So automation ensures consistency
and reliability, which is essential

173
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:12,400
for maintaining the critical business
operations without any interruption.

174
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,330
The next one, what we
see is business impact.

175
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:20,410
So again, how it is impacting the
business, how businesses using this SRE.

176
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,320
So the first one, what we see is
a predictable month-end close.

177
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:29,360
So achieve a predictable month-end close
process with the financial statements

178
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,800
consistently completed on time and
improving the stakeholder conference.

179
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,690
This predictability, reduce the
stress and finance teams and

180
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,670
also ensure timely reporting.

181
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:43,510
Some of the companies after using this SRE
approach, they reduce it from 10 days to

182
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,120
five days during the financial closing.

183
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,320
The second one, what we
see is reliable reporting.

184
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,290
So eliminated the system errors
in financial reports ensuring the

185
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,890
accurate and reliable financial
data for decision making.

186
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:02,360
This improvement enhanced the
credibility of the financial reports

187
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,360
and supported better business decisions.

188
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,990
So the third business impact, what
we see is really real time analytics.

189
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:15,430
System provided real time access
to financial data, enabling timely

190
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,260
and informed business decisions.

191
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:21,990
So this real time access supported
agile decision making and improved

192
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,580
overall business performance.

193
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:28,810
As an example, like ma users SA PS 400
plus power BA for realtime container cost

194
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,370
tracking cutting reporting errors by 90%.

195
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:37,050
That is a big achievement for the ma.
So the next one, what as part of this

196
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,270
is next one is cultural transformation.

197
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,920
So again, we have three different
approaches how it transformed.

198
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,490
So the first one, what we
see is shared ownership.

199
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,850
So both IT and finance teams
participated in the regular,

200
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:54,795
reliability reviews jointly prioritize
the system improvements fostering

201
00:11:54,795 --> 00:11:57,505
a culture of shared responsibility.

202
00:11:57,805 --> 00:12:02,005
So this collaboration ensures that both
technical and business perspectives

203
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:04,205
were considered in the decision making.

204
00:12:04,705 --> 00:12:07,015
The next one is data driven decisions.

205
00:12:07,095 --> 00:12:13,165
So use the data from monitoring tools to
identify areas needed needing investment

206
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:16,795
such as upgrading infrastructure,
opt or optimizing the processes.

207
00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:19,595
Ensuring the resources
were allocated effectively.

208
00:12:20,195 --> 00:12:24,545
So this data driven approach supported,
informed the decision making and

209
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:26,495
optimized the resources used.

210
00:12:27,315 --> 00:12:31,365
So the third transformation, what
we see is continuous improvement.

211
00:12:31,415 --> 00:12:37,055
So conducting monthly reviews of incidents
and near misses to identify trends and

212
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:41,825
implement improvements and continuously
enhancing the system reliability.

213
00:12:42,205 --> 00:12:47,665
So this regular review process ensures
that lessons learned were applied and

214
00:12:47,665 --> 00:12:50,275
that system was continuously optimized.

215
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:53,405
So that is one of the major
major improvement or the

216
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,085
transformation we need to consider.

217
00:12:55,355 --> 00:12:59,465
So we need to keep on keep on adding
the continuous improvement so that

218
00:12:59,515 --> 00:13:03,475
whatever the issues we have faced earlier
should not be receiving in near future.

219
00:13:03,725 --> 00:13:07,715
Moving on the next one, what we have
is a key implementation lessons.

220
00:13:08,295 --> 00:13:11,925
We have we have four different no four
different approaches, what we see,

221
00:13:12,195 --> 00:13:13,995
so the start with business metrics.

222
00:13:13,995 --> 00:13:19,455
So focus on metrics like a transaction,
complete time on financial closer.

223
00:13:19,505 --> 00:13:22,925
Close duration, which directly
impacts the business operations.

224
00:13:22,925 --> 00:13:26,375
So this focus ensures that
reliability improvements were

225
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,995
aligned with business goals.

226
00:13:28,045 --> 00:13:28,345
Okay.

227
00:13:28,345 --> 00:13:32,155
The next one is balance feature
velocity and reliability.

228
00:13:32,435 --> 00:13:35,405
It allows, so for certain
number of errors on the issues.

229
00:13:35,405 --> 00:13:39,795
So LY is balancing the need
of need for new features with

230
00:13:39,795 --> 00:13:41,535
maintaining system reliability.

231
00:13:42,075 --> 00:13:46,695
So this balance ensures that innovation
did not compromise system stability.

232
00:13:47,185 --> 00:13:51,745
We can have a couple of issues which will
come as part of that particular month end.

233
00:13:51,795 --> 00:13:52,005
Okay.

234
00:13:52,035 --> 00:13:55,715
And the next one, what we see is
investing cross trans training.

235
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:59,535
Conduct training sessions
where SR engineers learned

236
00:13:59,535 --> 00:14:01,005
about the financial process.

237
00:14:01,005 --> 00:14:04,815
And similarly, the finance teams were
educated on relatability principles.

238
00:14:04,865 --> 00:14:08,470
This cross training issues that
both the teams understand each

239
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,555
other, the priorities and could
work together effectively.

240
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:16,515
The final one, what we see is measured
business outcomes monitored not just

241
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:20,775
the system uptime on performance,
but also impact on the financial

242
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:25,685
operations such as time timeliness
and accuracy of financial reporting.

243
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:30,695
This comprehension measurement approach
ensures that the technical improvements

244
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:32,855
are translated into business benefits.

245
00:14:32,855 --> 00:14:38,005
So the next one, what we are looking at
is expanding SRE across business systems.

246
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:42,155
So the first one, what we are
looking is procurement systems.

247
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,980
So implementing reliability targets
and monitoring for the procurement

248
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,250
processes to ensure timely
and accurate order processing.

249
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,900
This expansion would improve the
efficiency and also the reliability

250
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,310
of supply chain operations.

251
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:02,045
So Boeing applies SRE to SAP Ariba
Slashing, PVO processes latency by 50%.

252
00:15:02,145 --> 00:15:04,855
So the next one is
manufacturing operations.

253
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:10,735
So applying SRE practices to manufacturing
systems to minimize downtime and also

254
00:15:10,735 --> 00:15:13,105
ensures consistent production output.

255
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:15,825
So this approach would enhance
production reliability.

256
00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:18,525
And also reduce the
operational disruptions.

257
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,835
The third one, implementing
SRE at HR platforms.

258
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:27,975
So ensuring high availability and
performance of HR systems such as payroll

259
00:15:27,975 --> 00:15:29,775
and employee self-service platforms.

260
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:33,975
So this implementation would
improve employee satisfaction

261
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,075
and also operational efficiency.

262
00:15:36,575 --> 00:15:41,195
So the final one, what we are looking at
is where we can apply customer service.

263
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:45,085
So improving the reliability of customer
service platforms and e-commerce

264
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:49,125
systems to enhance customer satisfaction
and reduce the service disruptions.

265
00:15:49,205 --> 00:15:52,705
So this focus would support
a better customer experiences

266
00:15:52,705 --> 00:15:54,995
and also business growth.

267
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:57,825
So this concludes our presentation.

268
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,305
Thank you so much for joining here today.

269
00:16:00,695 --> 00:16:05,315
By addressing the system latency
and global access disparities and

270
00:16:05,315 --> 00:16:09,775
reliability concerns we have significantly
improved our financial operations.

271
00:16:10,205 --> 00:16:15,305
Our SRE approach has enhanced system
availability and reduce the incident

272
00:16:15,305 --> 00:16:19,295
resolution times, and fostered a
culture of continuous improvement.

273
00:16:20,115 --> 00:16:23,775
So we look forward to expanding
these principles in across all

274
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:27,285
other business systems for greater
efficiency and reliability.

275
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,475
I appreciate your
attention and engagement.
