00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,780
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,690
Thank you for joining me today.

3
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:07,260
I'm Aditya Singh, and I'm excited to
present a framework that's transforming

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:13,180
how we evaluate search and recommendation
systems in the next 15 to 20 minutes.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,150
I'll show you why traditional
metrics are failing us, how we can do

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,059
better and the dramatic improvements
that we achieved in practice.

7
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:23,309
The challenge.

8
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:25,889
So let's start with the
fundamental question.

9
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:29,909
Why do we need to evolve
beyond traditional metrics?

10
00:00:30,409 --> 00:00:35,059
Traditional metrics, engagement
metrics like CTR, conversion rate,

11
00:00:35,089 --> 00:00:40,509
while valuable, fail to capture three
critical aspects of modern user behavior.

12
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:46,199
First, the position bias significantly
distorts our understanding.

13
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:49,519
Research shows that it can inflate CTR.

14
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:55,569
think about it, an item placed at the top
of page usually gets more attention, but

15
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:58,269
does that truly reflect its relevance?

16
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:03,769
Second, the users interact with
content in increasingly complex ways,

17
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:09,209
scrolling, hovering, partial views,
scrolling past and then coming back.

18
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:13,599
and these things are simply
missed by click measurements.

19
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:18,609
Third, with the rise of multimodal
content, videos, interactive elements,

20
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:23,659
rich media, we need metrics that
understand how different types of content

21
00:01:24,309 --> 00:01:26,799
influence user attention and engagement.

22
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,089
Let's move next.

23
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,269
so let's look at why
traditional metrics fall short.

24
00:01:32,769 --> 00:01:37,139
Take CTR as an example, while it provides
a baseline engagement metric, it fails to

25
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:40,689
account for three crucial context factors.

26
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,349
First, Algorithmic Ranking
Bias, where our own system's

27
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:47,289
decisions influence user behavior.

28
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:53,299
Second, Complex Interaction Patterns, how
users naturally navigate through content.

29
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:58,039
And third, the interplay between item
positioning and user selection behavior.

30
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:02,729
Our data shows these distortion
factors have significant impact.

31
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,139
Position based attention
decays varies by up to 30%.

32
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,139
Context item influence affects
engagement by 25 to 40%.

33
00:02:13,004 --> 00:02:17,664
Temporal patterns cause metric
fluctuations by up to 42%,

34
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:22,074
and device context requires
adjustments of approximately 25%.

35
00:02:22,074 --> 00:02:24,304
And these are just academic concerns.

36
00:02:24,304 --> 00:02:27,844
they directly affect our ability
to optimize for user experience.

37
00:02:28,344 --> 00:02:33,714
to address these challenges, We have,
developed three core mathematical models.

38
00:02:34,344 --> 00:02:36,804
don't worry if you're not a math
person, I'll break this down to you

39
00:02:36,804 --> 00:02:38,684
in, mathematical to practical terms.

40
00:02:38,684 --> 00:02:42,684
But before we go there, traditional
metrics, as I was talking about,

41
00:02:42,874 --> 00:02:48,294
if you just look at raw CTR, just
because something is in top position,

42
00:02:48,324 --> 00:02:50,684
it will have a higher raw CTR.

43
00:02:51,684 --> 00:02:53,824
But when used and conversion, actually.

44
00:02:54,584 --> 00:02:59,214
But when you normalize that conversion,
given the fact that this thing was

45
00:02:59,214 --> 00:03:04,854
shown at the top position, you find
out that the click through rates,

46
00:03:05,404 --> 00:03:11,244
or engagement rates rather, aren't
too different from the baseline.

47
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:16,239
You can see the blue bar here,
the red bar being the raw CTR.

48
00:03:16,249 --> 00:03:20,419
If of something on the left most
histogram, a bunch, you can see that the

49
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:24,209
red bar is basically the raw CTR observed
for something in the top position.

50
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:29,184
And because that thing was at the top
position, it's expected it will get some

51
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:34,074
engagement, but is that engagement coming
because it's a really engaging content or

52
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:35,674
because it was placed in that position?

53
00:03:36,444 --> 00:03:42,604
So this type of, gap, which
exists in, the engagement metrics.

54
00:03:43,044 --> 00:03:48,594
That we collect on our platforms can
lead us, can lead to skewed behavior

55
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:51,074
and also feedback loops in our system.

56
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:56,884
if something just directly shows up on
position one, it directly gets a boost.

57
00:03:57,024 --> 00:04:02,484
And because of that boost, the model or
the systems or the feedback mechanism

58
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:06,904
that has been built, a learned mechanism
or a mind mechanism, whatever it is,

59
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:14,329
It can be confused as though why was
this popular and these systems help

60
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:19,419
us identify that the popularity or the
engagement is coming either from position

61
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,109
or from the context or due to the type
of content that we have, whether it

62
00:04:26,109 --> 00:04:27,749
is because of the platform and so on.

63
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:31,029
So this is what we are dealing with.

64
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:35,369
As I said, we do have mathematical
models, that we can talk about.

65
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:39,729
and these, models basically
handle three different things,

66
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:43,719
three different independent
dimensions that we have identified.

67
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,439
first of all, it's our
position bias model.

68
00:04:47,034 --> 00:04:54,294
And, it can be described as a very simple,
what do you call it, a probability model

69
00:04:54,314 --> 00:05:00,744
in which we define the probability of a
click given at position i is defined as

70
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:06,744
by this relation where you can think of
beta i as an attention discount factor.

71
00:05:07,244 --> 00:05:10,954
It tells how much we need to
adjust for an item's position.

72
00:05:11,254 --> 00:05:16,964
So if something is in the top and if
it is relevant, then, give whatever

73
00:05:16,964 --> 00:05:22,484
its relevance be, we discount its,
relevance by an attention discount

74
00:05:22,484 --> 00:05:26,064
factor to truly know how relevant,
how engaging that content will be.

75
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:30,689
For instance, we found that position
five needs about 3x adjustment to

76
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:32,509
reflect the true engagement rate.

77
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:35,089
Second, the temporal decay function.

78
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:41,209
In this, we, in this formulation, we
capture how users attention diminishes

79
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:44,139
over time, but with an interesting twist.

80
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:46,619
Attention doesn't decay linearly.

81
00:05:47,049 --> 00:05:50,459
We found that users have bursts of
renewed interest, especially when they

82
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:53,119
encounter highly relevant content.

83
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:57,179
then third, we come to our
cross item influence model.

84
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:01,909
this relation gives us or helps
us rather understand how an items

85
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:03,789
affect each other's performance.

86
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:07,369
For example, a compelling video
can boost engagement with related

87
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:09,639
text content by up to 40%.

88
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:15,459
But if that text didn't was not
accompanied by a video, an engaging video,

89
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:17,999
then it would hardly get any attention.

90
00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:22,699
here we can look at the, user
attention decay analysis, something

91
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:26,049
that we have modeled and something
that is actually observed in data.

92
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:32,689
And you can see a lot of idiosyncrasies
or peculiarities rather that are observed

93
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:35,559
or that exists rather in a platform.

94
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:42,029
For example, if it's a mobile device and,
There are only, when it loads up, there

95
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:47,449
are only, three content views or three
things that you can display to the user.

96
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:53,259
the engagement rates or the impression
rates, rather impression count and

97
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,429
engagement rates further on for the
fourth item will be very different

98
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,739
from the engagement rates and metrics
observed for the first three items.

99
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:06,049
this is one sub system where the
fourth position was a little bit

100
00:07:06,049 --> 00:07:09,669
different compared to the first three,
and you can see it repeats again

101
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:11,979
when it you go to position eight.

102
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:17,279
So these, idiosyncrasies or
peculiarities differ within a platform.

103
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:22,259
So for example, you can prick show
the same content on web in which

104
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:23,989
you have a larger real estate.

105
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:27,649
So you can show multiple
pieces of content.

106
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:30,619
on mobile device, the
real estate is limited.

107
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:32,249
You only show a few.

108
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:36,299
So even these presentation
differences, UI differences or

109
00:07:36,299 --> 00:07:41,849
platform differences can affect how
the user interacts with your content.

110
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:47,109
Here, just to give a overview, the
relative attention score that you

111
00:07:47,109 --> 00:07:51,429
see on the y axis is a normalized
measure, and it's combined by using the

112
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:57,159
viewport timing, that is how long was
the item visible, active engagements,

113
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:01,759
that is how many clicks and hovers
did the user do, and then, scroll

114
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,669
velocity near the time, near the item.

115
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:10,934
you can see, that the attention is
higher in the top three positions.

116
00:08:11,604 --> 00:08:16,774
then there is some variance after that,
and then it stabilizes at some rate.

117
00:08:17,324 --> 00:08:21,744
and you can see that it, if we
just predicted by our theoretical

118
00:08:21,774 --> 00:08:26,104
model, there is some differences
in actual observed user behavior.

119
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:29,174
And this is what, essentially,
what we want to measure.

120
00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:32,274
Ahem.

121
00:08:32,774 --> 00:08:36,644
as we talked about, again, going, and
talking about a more comprehensive

122
00:08:36,644 --> 00:08:38,844
framework for contextualized evaluation.

123
00:08:39,194 --> 00:08:41,244
position bias needs to be corrected.

124
00:08:41,274 --> 00:08:42,984
There are multiple ways of correcting it.

125
00:08:43,574 --> 00:08:45,094
these are correction mechanisms.

126
00:08:45,094 --> 00:08:47,214
The other one were modeling, mechanisms.

127
00:08:47,854 --> 00:08:51,104
One more important thing that I would
like to talk about that we didn't cover

128
00:08:51,104 --> 00:08:53,554
earlier was the viewport tracking method.

129
00:08:54,254 --> 00:08:59,414
So things like, scrolled, depth
tracking, time for which the content

130
00:08:59,434 --> 00:09:03,824
was visible and the attention score are
some things which are very crucial in

131
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:09,464
figuring out how users and are, spending
their attention currency, I would say.

132
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:14,439
for example, scroll depth tracking,
we measure just depth of how deep

133
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:19,629
the user engaged by just figuring
out, the viewport bottom and then

134
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:22,119
normalizing it by the page height.

135
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,719
Similarly, for visibility time,
we figured that time out just

136
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:28,529
by summing up the start time.

137
00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:31,039
the difference in the end and
start time, and then summing up

138
00:09:31,229 --> 00:09:32,889
over all the pieces of content.

139
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:37,119
And then the attention score is just
simply, active time, viewed time in

140
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,869
active time divided by the total time.

141
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:45,439
usual stuff, but these, go a long way,
for, measuring, what we are looking for.

142
00:09:45,989 --> 00:09:48,249
the, what do you call it?

143
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:50,169
User attention analysis.

144
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:53,624
the, That's a good question.

145
00:09:53,624 --> 00:09:58,894
So now let's dive into what we have
learned about user attention patterns and

146
00:09:58,954 --> 00:10:06,254
the image that you see, displays how, and
what is this fascinating phenomena and

147
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:08,054
which challenges the conventional wisdom.

148
00:10:08,054 --> 00:10:11,324
So for example, you would
expect something to be on.

149
00:10:11,824 --> 00:10:16,114
that is ranked fourth to be more
engaging by default than rank five.

150
00:10:16,134 --> 00:10:21,264
But if you have a presentation, a matrix,
like a tile like presentation, and if the

151
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:24,774
fourth item that you recommended, which
you think is more relevant than compared

152
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:29,184
to the fifth item, shows up all the way
to the right and to the top, compared

153
00:10:29,234 --> 00:10:34,414
to the fifth item, which shows up just
below, the top ranked, content, you'll

154
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:38,784
see that the, in default engagement
rate, just because of the position

155
00:10:38,784 --> 00:10:44,334
is higher for content, which is on
position five compared to, position four.

156
00:10:45,224 --> 00:10:48,024
So observations are pretty evident.

157
00:10:48,134 --> 00:10:51,184
the top positions receive three
to five times more attention.

158
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:54,909
there exists a left side
bias in horizontal layout.

159
00:10:55,139 --> 00:11:01,319
Maybe it differs in places where content
or the language is read, or the script

160
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:03,419
is rather read from right to left.

161
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:06,579
In cases where the script is
read from left to right, there

162
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:08,069
might exist a left side bias.

163
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:10,999
If in the other cases, there
might be a right side bias.

164
00:11:11,044 --> 00:11:17,694
then there is a significant drop in,
engagement, a drop off points in the UI.

165
00:11:17,724 --> 00:11:23,944
So elements where, there are folds or
changes, then we see significant drop.

166
00:11:24,644 --> 00:11:28,754
And also, there is huge difference
as I have talked earlier between,

167
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:35,414
attention patterns, for users,
using, mobile devices or desktops.

168
00:11:35,514 --> 00:11:37,804
Desktops have a larger real estate.

169
00:11:38,374 --> 00:11:42,904
mobile devices on the hand have
completely different interface and so on.

170
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:49,974
um, again, content quality and user
intent act as powerful moderating factors.

171
00:11:50,664 --> 00:11:54,414
but still, position
bias can overpower them.

172
00:11:55,364 --> 00:11:58,884
we, then there exists something called
a tension cliff where you can see, as

173
00:11:58,894 --> 00:12:03,634
we have noted earlier, there is a drop
in, Attention or engagement at certain

174
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:08,184
positions, which is very peculiar to how
the content was presented to the users.

175
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:13,054
and also there exists some sort
of psychological threshold after

176
00:12:13,054 --> 00:12:17,674
which users switch from, systematic
to an exploratory browsing mode.

177
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:21,934
that psychological threshold can
show up in something where a user

178
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:23,564
says, I've scrolled enough pages.

179
00:12:23,964 --> 00:12:29,684
So that page itself becomes a unit of
attention, unit that got an attention, but

180
00:12:29,714 --> 00:12:32,414
the other sub, subsequent pages do not.

181
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:38,724
For example, you might have seen that
the, Google searches also, they usually

182
00:12:38,854 --> 00:12:41,464
almost no one navigates to position two.

183
00:12:41,555 --> 00:12:44,232
if the content is getting engaged
on second page, and almost no one

184
00:12:44,322 --> 00:12:47,382
definitely goes to page 3 or page
4, unless they're really looking

185
00:12:47,382 --> 00:12:48,562
for something very specific.

186
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:54,792
that page, the Google result page 1, is
one such, or switching from one page to

187
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:57,472
another, can be one such attention cliff.

188
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:02,832
if the content is getting engaged on
second page, That attention or that

189
00:13:02,892 --> 00:13:06,832
engagement could have, the rate could have
been much higher had that content been

190
00:13:06,832 --> 00:13:08,892
shown at a relevant position in page one.

191
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:14,382
So there, there are these things that,
very peculiar to how the whole system is

192
00:13:14,382 --> 00:13:18,192
orchestrated, how the platform exists,
why and how do users interact with it.

193
00:13:18,752 --> 00:13:21,232
And it also depends between each user.

194
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:25,500
different users, different, interact
with things very differently.

195
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,340
different generations, interact
with content differently.

196
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,130
Min and deal generation, Gen
Z and all those, there are

197
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,940
very, significant differences.

198
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:34,960
Sounds good.

199
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:40,620
then, before we go, I just want to
figure, say that, you know, all this

200
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,760
starts with a data collection layer.

201
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,230
And it's our foundation.

202
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,480
All of these observations are founded
by an excellent data collection

203
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,250
layer, which is able to give us
things like, the viewport tracking.

204
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,960
A lot of people don't have it.

205
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,640
I would highly suggest that you have
very sophisticated viewport tracking

206
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,710
and you capture as many events as
possible within on your platform.

207
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:10,905
viewport tracking for precise
visibility measurement, interaction

208
00:14:10,905 --> 00:14:15,125
events that show how users engage,
capture as many events as possible.

209
00:14:15,675 --> 00:14:18,335
user data for contextual understanding.

210
00:14:18,335 --> 00:14:23,325
So are we, saving the user journey, as
they are interacting with the content,

211
00:14:23,725 --> 00:14:28,635
as they logged in their session, what
happened in their session, and so on.

212
00:14:29,185 --> 00:14:32,405
And then content data to classify
different types of formats.

213
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:33,985
So for example, they logged in.

214
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,910
Your platform provides different types of
content that the user can interact with.

215
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:44,710
Let's say they interacted with, a video
content and then after that, two positions

216
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,950
after that, there is a text content.

217
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:53,740
So there are correlations, that
is, or rather observations that the

218
00:14:54,090 --> 00:15:01,530
Engagement rates after an engaging
content has been shown, they can change

219
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,020
the engagement rates on subsequent
content, which gets shown to the

220
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,990
user depending on what format it is.

221
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,530
that's one thing.

222
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:15,280
then, I would say, let's dive deep
into, user attention analysis.

223
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,850
so we already talked about it.

224
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,220
but.

225
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,900
Before we go to format level
analysis, let me also talk about

226
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,690
how do we mitigate position bias.

227
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,220
There are multiple ways to do it.

228
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,635
We have already talked about
some models and metrics to

229
00:15:32,675 --> 00:15:34,295
figure out the position bias.

230
00:15:34,905 --> 00:15:39,285
now some other ones are, viewport
visibility patterns are analyzed, to

231
00:15:39,285 --> 00:15:40,985
identify area of high user attention.

232
00:15:40,985 --> 00:15:42,225
We already talked about it.

233
00:15:42,305 --> 00:15:45,535
It requires, sophisticated,
what do you call it?

234
00:15:45,615 --> 00:15:50,119
The logging, of all the
events happening on the UI.

235
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:54,229
Then scroll, rep, distribution
data is used to adjust item scores

236
00:15:54,229 --> 00:15:55,529
based on relative likelihood.

237
00:15:55,579 --> 00:16:00,899
these can be done, up, away from what
your traditional ranking does, or this

238
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,939
can be built into your ranking model.

239
00:16:03,469 --> 00:16:09,594
that is how deep did the user interact
with your content or your platform and

240
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:14,064
all these models we have seen were done
when they can be done in very different

241
00:16:14,184 --> 00:16:18,824
approaches, but when they are applied in
whatever format they are applied, they

242
00:16:18,824 --> 00:16:22,284
do reduce position bias up to, up to 30%.

243
00:16:22,624 --> 00:16:24,104
It can even be higher.

244
00:16:24,104 --> 00:16:28,624
At least we have seen 30 percent and,
this can lead to an accurate measurement

245
00:16:28,794 --> 00:16:30,484
of item relevance and performance.

246
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:32,414
removing the position bias.

247
00:16:32,914 --> 00:16:36,444
let's go to, the next, type of
interaction, which can happen.

248
00:16:37,154 --> 00:16:40,184
this interaction is
cross format interaction.

249
00:16:40,704 --> 00:16:44,854
So moving to content format interactions,
our format interaction matrix

250
00:16:44,864 --> 00:16:46,534
reveals some surprising patterns.

251
00:16:46,534 --> 00:16:51,474
On the left hand side, you have, the
content which was shown first and on the

252
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:56,094
on the top most is the content that was
subsequently shown to the user and the

253
00:16:56,094 --> 00:17:01,484
numbers aren't exactly what we have, what
I mean, I have seen on different platforms

254
00:17:01,494 --> 00:17:05,664
because I, some things cannot be exactly
shared, but it looks something like this.

255
00:17:06,164 --> 00:17:12,434
where, the, format of an item that has
been, shown to the user affects how the

256
00:17:12,434 --> 00:17:14,234
user interacts with subsequent content.

257
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:17,824
videos emerge as the strongest
influence drivers, actually.

258
00:17:18,054 --> 00:17:22,264
And now we have observed that the
video length, if it's a short form

259
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:27,224
video, Reels and TikTok and all
that stuff, that, creates, what

260
00:17:27,224 --> 00:17:28,754
we call a tension halo effect.

261
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:33,289
They boost engagement with
neighboring content by 70 to 80

262
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:34,989
percent, but the timing is crucial.

263
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:38,829
the effect decays by about,
three or four positions.

264
00:17:38,969 --> 00:17:43,809
So, people can use this sort of
information to build models in which,

265
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:49,999
we are, repeatedly, spiking the,
engagement that we get out of the user.

266
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:54,249
So interactive elements now,
elements in which user can

267
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:56,449
click, tap, zoom in or whatever.

268
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,894
these things, create what
we call engagement momentum.

269
00:18:01,354 --> 00:18:05,904
So users who interact with one
interactive element are 75 percent

270
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:07,484
more likely to engage with others.

271
00:18:07,484 --> 00:18:10,574
And this creates opportunity
for strategic content placement.

272
00:18:11,074 --> 00:18:12,254
So think about it.

273
00:18:12,264 --> 00:18:18,044
So if you're coming up with an ad
creative, then, strategically placed

274
00:18:18,044 --> 00:18:22,284
and intelligently made, interactive
elements can just do wonders.

275
00:18:22,784 --> 00:18:25,864
And perhaps the most surprisingly,
we discovered that complementary

276
00:18:25,864 --> 00:18:29,544
format players like an infographic
showed by detailed text can boost

277
00:18:29,584 --> 00:18:31,674
mutual engagement rate by up to 40%.

278
00:18:32,224 --> 00:18:33,814
this isn't about just variety.

279
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:37,714
It's about creative, cognitive
synergies, by figuring out what

280
00:18:37,974 --> 00:18:40,594
the user behavior, is doing.

281
00:18:41,094 --> 00:18:43,799
let's look at the
implementation guidelines.

282
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,799
let's look at, concrete results.

283
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:50,719
our viewport aware scoring system has
transformed how we measure engagement

284
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:53,349
and delivered three CRE improvements.

285
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:58,249
First, precision in Attention measurement
are tracking systems capture micro second

286
00:18:58,249 --> 00:19:03,219
level visibility data, revealing users
making crucial engagement decisions

287
00:19:03,249 --> 00:19:05,859
as in as little as 300 milliseconds.

288
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:10,209
Second, we also account for what we
call engagement windows, optimal periods

289
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:14,179
when the users are most repetitive
to create, to certain content types.

290
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:18,819
For example, video content performs
35 percent better when presented

291
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:20,729
after text based engagement.

292
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,119
And third, by combining these insights
into our mathematical models, we have,

293
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:30,189
achieved a 28 percent increase in
optimization success, in optimizing

294
00:19:30,219 --> 00:19:33,069
for success rates across different
platforms and content types.

295
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:40,189
The, I mean, the accounting for
creative formats, the cross format

296
00:19:40,189 --> 00:19:41,949
interaction strength is really strong.

297
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:45,749
repeating what I just said earlier, but
the framework that we have estimates

298
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:50,899
how would the strength, what is the
actual strength and then based on that,

299
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:56,159
we can optimize of how to use that
strength and create these synergies

300
00:19:56,179 --> 00:19:57,609
that I was referring to earlier.

301
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:01,919
temporal retention decay is modeled
to capture diminishing effects of user

302
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,849
attention over time, particularly in the
long term, and these insights inform the

303
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:10,289
evaluation process leading to significant
improvement in optimization decisions.

304
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:10,359
Thank you.

305
00:20:10,664 --> 00:20:14,754
As I just, defined, and this is also
something that we, I just covered.

306
00:20:15,184 --> 00:20:19,264
we need viewport tracking and precise
tracking, session level dynamics

307
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:24,374
of how users are interacting with
the platform within each session.

308
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:30,374
And then, we, the metric that we figure
out that, we are measuring how accurate

309
00:20:30,434 --> 00:20:32,944
is that measurement and where is that
measurement actually coming from.

310
00:20:33,444 --> 00:20:35,734
all of this depends on
good data collection.

311
00:20:35,994 --> 00:20:40,624
as I said, capturing real world viewport
visibility data, spatial temporal

312
00:20:40,624 --> 00:20:45,124
interaction mapping, and finally
controlled experiments in which users

313
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:53,639
are exposed to certain combinations,
certain UI elements or, certain, content,

314
00:20:53,709 --> 00:20:59,559
types or pairs or combinations are some
things, how through which we can learn

315
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,619
more and then optimize our system better.

316
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:04,579
real world impact of this
framework has been substantial.

317
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:07,049
Let me share three key metrics
that demonstrate its value.

318
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:08,929
The prediction reliability
has now improved.

319
00:21:08,989 --> 00:21:10,449
By 35%.

320
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:14,719
In practical terms, this means we are
significantly better at forecasting which

321
00:21:14,729 --> 00:21:16,239
content will resonate with the user.

322
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:20,569
For content team, it translates to
more efficient resource allocation

323
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:22,129
and better editorial decisions.

324
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:25,829
Our optimization success
rate has increased by 28%.

325
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:30,599
Teams using this framework are more
informed, at decision making about

326
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:32,329
content placement and format selection.

327
00:21:32,349 --> 00:21:36,239
One team introduced A B testing, reduced
their A B testing cycle time by 40

328
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:37,714
percent by achieving better results.

329
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:41,064
More importantly, these aren't
just metric improvements.

330
00:21:41,104 --> 00:21:45,754
We are seeing tangible user experience
enhancements and with 15 percent increase

331
00:21:45,754 --> 00:21:50,044
in session depth and a 23 percent
improvement in content discovery.

332
00:21:50,094 --> 00:21:51,284
let's go to the next slide.

333
00:21:51,994 --> 00:21:55,704
So looking ahead, we are exploring
four exciting directions that we'll

334
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,704
be, further enhance this framework.

335
00:21:58,034 --> 00:22:01,814
I see I have only listed three
here, but, let me go through them.

336
00:22:01,844 --> 00:22:06,794
First is, we use advanced ML models.

337
00:22:06,844 --> 00:22:12,664
then, so that sort of works for us
by doing personalized normalization,

338
00:22:13,564 --> 00:22:17,304
because we are going to learn a user
profile and how that user particularly

339
00:22:17,314 --> 00:22:19,344
interacts with our, platform.

340
00:22:20,084 --> 00:22:22,264
Then we do multi modal evaluation.

341
00:22:22,444 --> 00:22:26,974
We are expanding our framework to handle
emerging formats like in augmented

342
00:22:26,974 --> 00:22:29,244
reality and interactive visualizations.

343
00:22:29,744 --> 00:22:32,304
this includes development of
new metrics specifically for

344
00:22:32,304 --> 00:22:33,654
immersive content experiences.

345
00:22:34,154 --> 00:22:37,984
And, the other thing is a real
time adaptation of framework

346
00:22:38,014 --> 00:22:39,224
by evolving user behavior.

347
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:45,454
And this, is, done by the next generation
of models, which will adjust by it with

348
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:50,384
online training that is happening all
the time, based on how the users are

349
00:22:50,614 --> 00:22:52,274
now interacting with the, platform.

350
00:22:53,034 --> 00:22:55,374
And think of it as adaptive
normalization system.

351
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,994
I think, there can be another
thing in which we are doing

352
00:22:58,994 --> 00:23:00,454
privacy first analytics.

353
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:04,054
whatever we are learning, we, can
do it in a federated way such that

354
00:23:04,074 --> 00:23:06,564
the user privacy is preserved.

355
00:23:06,964 --> 00:23:09,814
we do learn how the user
interacts, but we do it in a way

356
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:11,114
that is very privacy preserving.

357
00:23:11,114 --> 00:23:12,014
key takeaways.

358
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:12,554
Okay.

359
00:23:12,604 --> 00:23:14,884
as we conclude, I want to
emphasize three critical points.

360
00:23:15,874 --> 00:23:17,694
First, the context matters more than ever.

361
00:23:17,904 --> 00:23:20,864
Traditional metrics alone
cannot capture the complexity

362
00:23:20,864 --> 00:23:22,404
of modern user interactions.

363
00:23:22,904 --> 00:23:27,254
Our frameworks provide necessary context
to make meaningful optimization decisions.

364
00:23:27,664 --> 00:23:31,934
Second, normalization and correction
aren't just technical necessities.

365
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:35,384
They are fundamental to understanding
true content performance in today's

366
00:23:35,394 --> 00:23:37,384
multi format, multi device world.

367
00:23:38,254 --> 00:23:40,554
Finally, data driven insights,
when properly contextualized,

368
00:23:41,284 --> 00:23:44,114
lead to significantly better
optimization decisions.

369
00:23:44,144 --> 00:23:46,724
We have seen this across
different platforms, content

370
00:23:46,734 --> 00:23:47,924
types, and user segments.

371
00:23:48,424 --> 00:23:52,424
So these three takeaways, these are
some advanced metric components.

372
00:23:52,424 --> 00:23:53,424
You guys can take a look.

373
00:23:53,504 --> 00:23:55,074
I have added them to the slides.

374
00:23:55,174 --> 00:23:55,894
feel free.

375
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:57,714
ping me with any questions.

376
00:23:58,274 --> 00:24:00,024
This is the implementation architecture.

377
00:24:00,084 --> 00:24:01,034
pretty standard.

378
00:24:01,034 --> 00:24:06,014
you guys can go through it and,
it, it's, it has everything

379
00:24:06,014 --> 00:24:07,244
that I've already talked about.

380
00:24:07,784 --> 00:24:13,604
Um, The slide is attached in the
future ML directions, I would say, the

381
00:24:13,604 --> 00:24:15,864
future direction is advanced ML models.

382
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:19,874
As I said, we went through real time
adaptation, multimodal enhancement,

383
00:24:19,874 --> 00:24:21,434
and privacy first analytics.

384
00:24:21,984 --> 00:24:23,584
with this, I would say thank you.

385
00:24:24,284 --> 00:24:25,224
Thank you for your attention.

386
00:24:25,354 --> 00:24:28,244
I look forward to your questions and
discussing how these approaches might

387
00:24:28,264 --> 00:24:31,614
benefit you in your specific use cases.

388
00:24:32,374 --> 00:24:32,794
Thank you.
