1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,040
Good morning.

2
00:00:01,339 --> 00:00:06,229
I'm Kendra Prakash Rojo Senior
software engineer at C and

3
00:00:06,229 --> 00:00:07,790
Property Insurance Corporation.

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:14,600
Today I'll walk you through how AI edge
computing and serverless architectures

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,810
are reshaping insurance incident response.

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,060
The world is changing rapidly.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,490
Customers expect faster service.

8
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:27,215
Regulators demand more compliance
and risks like cyber attacks and

9
00:00:27,215 --> 00:00:29,165
climate change events are rising.

10
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:34,025
This presentation is about how
modern cloud native technologies

11
00:00:34,025 --> 00:00:39,395
can help insurers respond faster,
scale better, and serve customers

12
00:00:39,455 --> 00:00:41,525
with more trust and transparency,

13
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:43,405
traditional challenges.

14
00:00:43,705 --> 00:00:47,305
Let's begin with the pain
points most insurers face today.

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,540
Slow incident detection.

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,760
For example, many incidents remain
unnoticed for hours or even days.

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,190
Delaying recovery and adding costs.

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:02,710
Manual claim processes like adjusters
are overloaded, creating frustrating

19
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,599
backlogs for policy holders.

20
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:10,180
Lack of realtime insights, so
without Im Lee, data insurers still

21
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,900
reactive instead of preventing
losses, scalability, bottlenecks.

22
00:01:14,545 --> 00:01:19,135
During disasters, like hurricanes,
systems often collapse,

23
00:01:19,435 --> 00:01:20,995
which are under heavy demand.

24
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,795
They're not small issues.

25
00:01:22,855 --> 00:01:27,025
They directly affect customer
trust, operational cost, and

26
00:01:27,445 --> 00:01:28,795
long-term competitiveness.

27
00:01:29,295 --> 00:01:30,980
AI powered performance.

28
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,240
AI has already started
transforming insurance operations.

29
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,850
In underwriting AI models.

30
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:42,800
Analyze IO OT sensors, driving
behavior property data to provide

31
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,690
more accurate risk assessments.

32
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,090
This reduces errors and improves pricing.

33
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:53,530
Claims AI automation speeds up
resolution like chat bots, gather

34
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,440
information, algorithms try out severity.

35
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,090
Thereby human justice can only
handle exceptions in fraud.

36
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:07,345
Detections AI identifies patterns that
humans might miss catching fraudulent

37
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,310
claims before payouts are made.

38
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,170
These results are very clear that it
provides better accuracy, faster service.

39
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,400
Reduced fraud and improved profitability.

40
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,890
Edge computing.

41
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,230
Edge computing means processing data
where it's created rather than sending

42
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,540
everything back to central service.

43
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,760
For insurers, this is crucial.

44
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,350
Take a flood sensor in a home With
edge computing, this sensor can

45
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,970
trigger an alert immediately, even if
connectivity to the cloud is delayed.

46
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,940
Or think about telematics in cars.

47
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,230
Like accident data can be
analyzed locally, so insurers

48
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,030
can take actions immediately.

49
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:54,320
This reduces latency, saves bandwidth,
and ensures faster responses that directly

50
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,840
protects customers and minimize claims.

51
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,810
Serverless benefits.

52
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:01,900
Serverless architecture
is like electricity.

53
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,179
You don't worry about the power plant.

54
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,950
You just use what you need.

55
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:12,760
For insurers, this means always on
scalability, like claim portals won't

56
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,429
crash during the search In disasters,
faster deployments, new tools like

57
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:20,679
claim apps can be launched in days.

58
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,750
Customer first service.

59
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,880
Serverless systems handle traffic
smoothly, providing instant responses.

60
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,590
Serverless architecture combines
flexibility and reliability, ensuring

61
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:38,650
insurers can innovate you quickly while
staying prepared for high pressure events,

62
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,560
intelligent incident detection.

63
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,820
Here is where AI shines
in incident response.

64
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,530
Like real-time monitoring.

65
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:52,260
AI continuously scans underwriting
and claims data for unusual patterns.

66
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,700
Pattern recognitions like
machine learning detects fraud or

67
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,490
risks early automated alerting.

68
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,845
Once something is identified, the
system notifies the right team with

69
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:06,485
CVR levels and recommended actions.

70
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:11,795
This approach shifts ensures
from slow manual reactions to

71
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:14,195
fast data-driven decision making,

72
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:18,055
edge driven real-time intelligence.

73
00:04:18,415 --> 00:04:22,105
This slide shows how edge
and cloud work together.

74
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:26,755
Like connected sensors
capture, react data, raw data.

75
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:30,445
Each processing provides
instant and local insights.

76
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,500
Cloud intelligence analyzes large
patterns across multiple sources.

77
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,870
Informed actions allows insurers
to optimize decisions from claim

78
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,610
approvals to fraud preventions.

79
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:48,365
This layered model delivers both speed
at the source and deep insights at scale.

80
00:04:48,865 --> 00:04:53,215
Automated root cause analysis when
incidents happen, understanding

81
00:04:53,215 --> 00:04:55,375
the root cause quickly is critical.

82
00:04:55,735 --> 00:05:00,565
AI gathers data from multiple
systems, analyze patterns, and

83
00:05:00,805 --> 00:05:06,445
identifies the true root cause,
whether it's weather related or damage

84
00:05:07,075 --> 00:05:09,145
equipment failure or human error.

85
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,700
It then generates
recommendations for remediations.

86
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:17,710
This means insurers not only fix
today's problems faster, but also

87
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,630
learn how to prevent them tomorrow.

88
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:25,560
Large scale disruptions, major disasters,
put systems under extreme pressure.

89
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,270
Here is how modern systems handle
them, like auto-scaling, which

90
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,865
expands resources instantly.

91
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,290
Dynamic allocations, which shifts
workloads from across regions,

92
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,440
failover and backups that keep critical
operations running load balancer, load

93
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,650
balancing, which smooths traffic spikes.

94
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,060
For insurers, this means
uninterrupted service, even during

95
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,140
catastrophic events, protecting
both operations and customer trust.

96
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,500
Blockchain for reinsurance.

97
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,720
Blockchain has strong use cases in
reinsurance, like smart contracts,

98
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,670
which automate settlements transparency,
which provides immutable audit trials

99
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:13,550
efficiency that reduces manual steps
and speeds up payouts trust, which

100
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,740
grows between insurers and reinsurers.

101
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,430
By combining automation and
transparency, blockchain simplifies

102
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,990
that, which has traditionally
been a slow, complex process.

103
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,450
Hybrid cloud.

104
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,850
Hybrid Cloud provides a balance.

105
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,130
Insurers need sensitivity.

106
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:37,520
Regulated data can stay in private or
on-prem systems while scalable workloads

107
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,890
like analytics run in the public cloud.

108
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,150
This ensures.

109
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:48,320
Compliance with regulations like GDPR
and H-I-P-A-A while still unlocking

110
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,720
the benefits of cloud scale and speed.

111
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,670
It's a practical way forward
for insurers modernizing without

112
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,710
risks, risking compliance.

113
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,950
Compliance and elig agility Compliance
is a cornerstone of insurance.

114
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:08,801
Modern platforms embed compliance with
frameworks like G-D-P-R-H-I-P-A-A.

115
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,360
Logging and monitoring.

116
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,970
Simplify audits while automated
governance ensure sensitivity data is

117
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,310
protected across multiple environments.

118
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,620
This lets insurers maintain
both agility and compliance.

119
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,160
A combination that used
to be seen as impossible

120
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,010
implementation roadmap.

121
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,350
How do insurers get started?

122
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:34,800
Access the current state, understand
where systems stand today.

123
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,510
Design a strategy.

124
00:07:36,975 --> 00:07:41,385
Decide how AI edge and
serverless fit into operations.

125
00:07:41,715 --> 00:07:45,375
Pilot programs test in small
controlled environments.

126
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:47,055
Scale and optimize.

127
00:07:47,325 --> 00:07:49,905
Expand what works continuously improve.

128
00:07:50,325 --> 00:07:56,205
This phased approach ensures
transformation without overwhelming teams.

129
00:07:56,705 --> 00:07:57,695
Key takeaways.

130
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,045
Three things to remember.

131
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:04,955
Measurable impact AI and cloud
improve accuracy, speed, and

132
00:08:04,955 --> 00:08:07,325
cost integrated approach.

133
00:08:07,385 --> 00:08:12,725
Combining AI and EDGE and serverless
architecture drives transformation.

134
00:08:12,995 --> 00:08:18,215
Strategic rollout hybrid cloud ensures
compliance while enabling innovation.

135
00:08:19,094 --> 00:08:21,555
This is not about adopting one tool.

136
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:25,635
It's about building an
ecosystem that's future ready,

137
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:27,244
ready to transform.

138
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:30,025
The question is, are
we ready to transform?

139
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:34,974
Insurers who act now will set
the standard in customer service,

140
00:08:35,035 --> 00:08:37,075
compliance, and resilience.

141
00:08:37,405 --> 00:08:43,645
Those who wait will struggle to catch up
with AI edge and serverless architecture.

142
00:08:43,885 --> 00:08:47,545
The tools exist today to
revolutionize insurance response.

143
00:08:47,785 --> 00:08:51,175
The opportunity is to
lead, not just adapt.

144
00:08:51,675 --> 00:08:54,015
Thanking you for joining today.

145
00:08:54,375 --> 00:09:00,675
I hope you this gave you a clear
picture of how ai, h computing, and

146
00:09:00,675 --> 00:09:05,115
serverless architecture can transform
incident response to insurance.

147
00:09:05,655 --> 00:09:09,705
