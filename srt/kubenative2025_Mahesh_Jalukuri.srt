00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,720
Hi, welcome to Automation for Equitable
and Resilient Digital Public Services.

2
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:07,310
I am Mahi Kuri.

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,549
I'm accepted to be part of CNET 2 20 25.

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,630
In this talk, I will walk you through
how Kubernetes need to automation

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,350
is changing the way the government's
deliver the digital services.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,660
My goal is to show you not just the
technology, but the social impact, how

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,520
this transformation can make services
more accessible, more reliable, more

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,890
equitable for citizens everywhere.

9
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,770
The digital public service RESO
revolution, governments across the

10
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,139
are rapidly digitizing citizens.

11
00:00:38,169 --> 00:00:42,370
Expect 24 by seven service
availability, quick updates.

12
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:46,690
And inclusive experiences,
regardless of language or geography.

13
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:50,890
Traditional IT systems are not
designed for the scale or speed.

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,390
Kubernetes native automation enables
government to meet these demands.

15
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:00,160
For example, think about applying for
benefits online at midnight or during

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,790
a national emergency where millions
of people log in simultaneously.

17
00:01:04,389 --> 00:01:07,920
With modern automation the
experience doesn't collapse.

18
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,779
It scales up seamlessly.

19
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:13,534
Why Kubernetes Native Automation matters.

20
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:14,764
So why does it matter?

21
00:01:15,214 --> 00:01:20,134
Scalability ensures governments can
handle certain spikes like tax filing

22
00:01:20,134 --> 00:01:22,174
deadlines or vaccine registrations.

23
00:01:22,594 --> 00:01:26,014
Reliability ensures services
stay up during the movement,

24
00:01:26,014 --> 00:01:27,604
citizen need them the most.

25
00:01:27,964 --> 00:01:29,974
Equity is about fairness.

26
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:33,484
Everyone should get the same
quality of service whether they're

27
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:35,854
in major city or a remote village.

28
00:01:36,845 --> 00:01:40,835
And efficiency matters because
governments must do more with less

29
00:01:40,925 --> 00:01:43,024
optimizing taxpayers resources.

30
00:01:43,684 --> 00:01:48,994
Taken together all these four pillars make
Kubernetes native automation, not just

31
00:01:48,994 --> 00:01:56,604
technical solution but pub, but for public
good 37% system availability increase.

32
00:01:57,054 --> 00:01:58,749
Our research showed that public sector.

33
00:01:59,395 --> 00:02:04,314
Organizations used Kubernetes
Automation achieved a 37% increase

34
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:05,934
in the system's availability.

35
00:02:06,654 --> 00:02:11,964
That means fewer disruptions of fewer
disruptions and more trust from citizens.

36
00:02:12,235 --> 00:02:17,575
Imagine healthcare portals, emergency
response apps, or welfare systems staying

37
00:02:17,575 --> 00:02:20,125
up consistently during the critical times.

38
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,854
This improvement is more than a number.

39
00:02:23,454 --> 00:02:27,940
It's about ensuring the citizens rely
their government when it matters the most.

40
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,990
Cross sector impact analysis.

41
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,450
We studied the impact across healthcare,
legal services, and public utilities.

42
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,100
The three domains highlight how
broad and deep the changes can be.

43
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:47,160
Healthcare benefited from telemedicine,
scaling legal services, improved access

44
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,005
and reduced backlogs and utilities,
improved resilience in rural areas.

45
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,895
The theme here is simple
automation transforms not only

46
00:02:55,895 --> 00:03:01,144
how efficiently systems run, but
also fair how fairly services are

47
00:03:01,144 --> 00:03:03,364
delivered to diverse citizens.

48
00:03:03,864 --> 00:03:06,654
Healthcare transformation
results in healthcare.

49
00:03:06,804 --> 00:03:08,304
The results were dramatic.

50
00:03:08,604 --> 00:03:12,324
Telemedicine consultations grew by 430%.

51
00:03:13,314 --> 00:03:15,114
That's not just a statistic.

52
00:03:15,144 --> 00:03:19,074
It means patients who couldn't
get an appointment in person had

53
00:03:19,134 --> 00:03:20,904
new options to access the care.

54
00:03:21,474 --> 00:03:27,154
Few rollout times dropped from, future
rollout times dropped from 45 days to just

55
00:03:27,154 --> 00:03:32,014
seven in public health, those weeks can
mean the difference between controlling

56
00:03:32,014 --> 00:03:34,114
an outbreak and letting it spread.

57
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:39,279
Kubernetes automation gave
systems the agility they needed.

58
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:45,479
Legal system, digital equity gains
in legal system, digital automation,

59
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:48,209
reduced code backlog by 23%.

60
00:03:48,749 --> 00:03:50,819
That means cases got resolved faster.

61
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:54,869
He's pressure on courts and
providing justice more quickly.

62
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,549
Equally important, multilingual
automation, improved access for

63
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:02,159
non-English speaking by 52%.

64
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:03,899
That's a huge step.

65
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:07,649
Ensuring equity, everyone,
regardless of language, can

66
00:04:07,649 --> 00:04:09,899
navigate the legal system digitally.

67
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:12,949
Infrastructure, resilience, ments.

68
00:04:13,339 --> 00:04:19,249
Emergency services achieved
99.999% uptime thanks to air

69
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:21,109
driven self-healing infrastructure.

70
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:25,279
The level of reliability is
crucial when lives are on the line.

71
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,739
In rural areas, it deployments
reduced outages by 76%.

72
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:34,999
Imagine a small community
relying on consistent power or

73
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:39,439
water automation ensures these
essential services don't fail.

74
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:45,879
This demonstrates how resilience is not
just a technical but deeply human in

75
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:50,039
its impact, financial impact, and ROI.

76
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:54,929
Automation also delivered financial
value organizations reduced cost by up

77
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:58,799
to 34% within the two years and 42%.

78
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:01,869
By the year three, these savings.

79
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,999
Aren't about cutting corners.

80
00:05:04,059 --> 00:05:07,599
They result from systems running
more efficiently, scaling

81
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,519
smartly, and reducing downtime.

82
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:11,709
This creates sustainability.

83
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:15,759
Governments can invest those
resources into new initiatives while

84
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,559
maintaining high service quality

85
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:19,864
staff innovation capacity growth.

86
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:21,569
More automation.

87
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:25,129
Only 23% of staff was
available for innovation.

88
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:29,569
Most time was spent on
firefighting and manual processes.

89
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:32,959
After automation, that number grew to 58%.

90
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,839
Think about that means what that means.

91
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,739
Staff can now focus on creating
better citizen experiences,

92
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:43,639
designing new programs, and
thinking strategically instead of

93
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,274
trouble troubleshooting servers.

94
00:05:46,024 --> 00:05:50,614
This shift is where technology
directly improves human potential

95
00:05:51,114 --> 00:05:52,554
implementation challenges.

96
00:05:52,674 --> 00:05:55,314
Of course, no transformation
is without challenges.

97
00:05:55,824 --> 00:05:57,654
The first is a skill gap.

98
00:05:57,954 --> 00:06:02,244
Kubernetes expertise is limited
in many public sectors requiring

99
00:06:02,744 --> 00:06:04,784
targeted training and partnerships.

100
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:07,034
The second is legacy.

101
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:08,234
Integration.

102
00:06:08,564 --> 00:06:12,464
All systems don't disappear
overnight, so careful migration

103
00:06:12,494 --> 00:06:14,264
planning is very essential.

104
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:17,474
And the third is risk of a digital divide.

105
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:22,064
We must ensure that automation
includes vulnerable populations

106
00:06:22,064 --> 00:06:23,984
rather than excluding them.

107
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:25,714
Policy recommendations.

108
00:06:25,924 --> 00:06:29,464
To address these challenges,
we recommend four key actions.

109
00:06:29,464 --> 00:06:29,584
First.

110
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:34,584
Establish cross agency standards
to align security and operations.

111
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:40,344
Second, invest in workforce development
with structured training programs.

112
00:06:40,854 --> 00:06:43,614
Third practice inclusive design.

113
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:46,734
So accessibility built into every project.

114
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:53,484
And finally, foster private partnership
that brings in expertise, but keep

115
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:56,634
public control over essential services.

116
00:06:57,354 --> 00:06:58,374
These are practical.

117
00:06:58,809 --> 00:07:01,569
Actionable steps
governments can take today.

118
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:03,509
Implementation framework.

119
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:07,669
Our implementation framework breaks
the journey into four phases.

120
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:12,409
The first three months, assess
infrastructure and establish baseline

121
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:15,259
metrics in months four to eight.

122
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:19,099
Pilot Kubernetes in
low list risk services.

123
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:23,929
In months nine to 18, scale
up the critical services

124
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:26,059
with citizens feedback loops.

125
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:32,569
Finally, continuous optimization ensures
system adapt with AI and evolving needs.

126
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:38,209
This phased approach reduces the risk
and builds confidence at every step.

127
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,124
Building institutional
trust through technology.

128
00:07:41,574 --> 00:07:45,144
Successful automation does
more than improve uptime.

129
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:49,554
It strengthens the relationship
between governments and citizens.

130
00:07:49,974 --> 00:07:55,524
Transparency in service status
con, consistent quality, proactive

131
00:07:55,554 --> 00:07:58,254
communication, and accessible design.

132
00:07:58,524 --> 00:07:59,754
All of these build trust.

133
00:08:00,549 --> 00:08:06,099
Andrus in institutions is vital
for Democrat democratic engagement.

134
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:12,309
When citizens see reliability, unfairness,
and digital services, they engage more

135
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:15,339
and believe more in the institutions.

136
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,919
The next steps.

137
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:22,909
So should organizations do next,
start by assessing your infrastructure

138
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:24,979
and mapping the citizen's journey.

139
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:26,650
Then build your team.

140
00:08:27,055 --> 00:08:30,774
Invest in Kubernetes training
and cross-functional groups.

141
00:08:31,315 --> 00:08:37,485
Finally, start small, but scale
smart pilots in low risk areas,

142
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:42,255
build momentum and confidence before
tackling mission critical systems.

143
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:48,315
The important thing is to begin
transformation doesn't have to be massive.

144
00:08:48,315 --> 00:08:53,595
One day, small wins accumulate
into systematic change.

145
00:08:54,095 --> 00:08:58,505
And thank you for joining this session
on Kubernetes Native Automation

146
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,245
for Digital Public Services.

147
00:09:00,485 --> 00:09:06,965
I hope these insights inspire you to
think about where automation can make the

148
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:11,795
biggest impact In your next context, I
would like to continue the conversation.

149
00:09:12,295 --> 00:09:15,595
If you'd like to continue the
conversation, I'd be glad to connect

150
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:20,935
on LinkedIn or during q and a. Together
we can build more resilient, equitable,

151
00:09:21,205 --> 00:09:23,995
citizen focused services for the future.

152
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:25,285
Thank you again.

153
00:09:25,785 --> 00:09:26,005
Bye.
