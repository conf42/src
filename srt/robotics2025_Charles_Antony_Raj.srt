1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,590
Everyone, good morning, good
afternoon, or good evening,

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,110
whatever time it is where you are.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,990
Allow me to introduce myself.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,120
My name is Charles Anthony Raj.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,410
I currently serve as a senior manager
for systems and software engineering

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,025
at Collins Aerospace and RTX Company.

7
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:21,395
In my current role within the
Electric Systems Business Unit, I lead

8
00:00:21,395 --> 00:00:25,715
engineering efforts focused on advancing
cutting edge aerospace technologies.

9
00:00:26,215 --> 00:00:29,875
With about two decades of experience
in the aerospace industry, I've had

10
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:34,135
the opportunity to work across a
wide range of aircraft subsystems,

11
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:38,125
contributing to several major
platforms throughout my career.

12
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:44,054
Today I will be talking to you all
about DL 1 78 C in Multicore avionics.

13
00:00:44,894 --> 00:00:49,684
Certification paths for electric aircraft,
the multi-core revolution in aviation.

14
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:53,785
The aviation industry is entering
the multi-core revolution after

15
00:00:53,785 --> 00:00:58,105
having lived on the single core
processes for a very long time, and

16
00:00:58,105 --> 00:01:01,944
it is driven by demand for higher
performance, efficiency, and autonomy.

17
00:01:02,444 --> 00:01:06,345
Multi core processors are transforming
how next generation and electric

18
00:01:06,345 --> 00:01:07,870
aircrafts are designed and certified.

19
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,720
Just look at the adoption rate.

20
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,150
Multi-core processors are now widely
deployed in multiple modern platforms.

21
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,330
From electric propulsion
systems to advanced avionics.

22
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,760
They enable greater computing power
and system integration essential for

23
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,950
the next wave of intelligent aircraft.

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,429
It does come with the baggage.

25
00:01:26,929 --> 00:01:31,910
Certification delays many programs,
first face certification delays.

26
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,949
Due to the complexity of multi-core
timing and interference analysis,

27
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:41,149
these challenges highlight the
need for early planning and

28
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:42,979
robust verification strategies.

29
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:48,489
Teams are using proven partitioning,
measurement based timing analysis,

30
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:51,509
and early certification engagement.

31
00:01:52,094 --> 00:01:53,864
To see significant time savings.

32
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:58,054
These best practices shorten compliance
cycles and help bring advanced

33
00:01:58,054 --> 00:01:59,945
aircraft to the market much faster.

34
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:01,914
The multi-core revolution is here.

35
00:02:02,215 --> 00:02:07,074
Success depends on pairing innovation
with disciplined proven certification

36
00:02:07,074 --> 00:02:12,615
methods, why multi-core for air
electric aircraft demand faster,

37
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:15,195
smarter, and more efficient computing.

38
00:02:15,695 --> 00:02:18,245
Multi-core processors provide
the foundation for this

39
00:02:18,245 --> 00:02:19,955
generation of flight systems.

40
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:25,015
There are these three major advantages,
performance, integration, and efficiency.

41
00:02:25,515 --> 00:02:29,895
Multi-core processors deliver enhanced
computational power needed for complex

42
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:33,015
robotic control and autonomous operations.

43
00:02:33,515 --> 00:02:39,155
It enables an advanced flight
management sensor fusion and

44
00:02:39,155 --> 00:02:41,645
onboard AI to operate in real time.

45
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:45,365
Multicore processor architecture
allows multiple avionics

46
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:50,615
functions to run on fewer hardware
platforms, which is a great boon.

47
00:02:51,425 --> 00:02:57,395
This reduces weight wiring and system
complexity, all absolutely critical

48
00:02:57,395 --> 00:02:59,075
for electric aircraft efficiency.

49
00:02:59,575 --> 00:03:03,085
Multicore architectures enable
optimized power consumption.

50
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:06,945
Maximize maximizing energy
available for propulsion.

51
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:11,865
This balance of performance and efficiency
is essential in electric aircraft.

52
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:20,255
In short, multi-core computing powers the
Electric Aviation Revolution, delivering

53
00:03:20,255 --> 00:03:25,385
performance, integration and energy
efficiency for the aircraft of the future.

54
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:27,595
The certification challenge.

55
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:29,235
Address the elephant in the room.

56
00:03:29,735 --> 00:03:34,265
Multi-core architectures are transforming
avionics, but they also fundamentally

57
00:03:34,265 --> 00:03:39,635
change how we certify safety critical
software under DO 1 7 8 C. Especially

58
00:03:39,665 --> 00:03:44,005
for design assurance levels A through
C, the challenge lies in maintaining

59
00:03:44,005 --> 00:03:48,355
predictability and determinism
across multiple processing cores.

60
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:51,345
Multiple core share cashes.

61
00:03:51,705 --> 00:03:53,775
Memory buses and IO channels.

62
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:57,575
This competition introduces
unpredictable timing behavior,

63
00:03:57,755 --> 00:03:59,885
which complicates safety validation.

64
00:04:00,385 --> 00:04:05,815
Cross core interference can disrupt
deterministic execution, must for

65
00:04:05,815 --> 00:04:08,125
flight critical control functions.

66
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:13,140
Ensuring isolation and predictable
scheduling becomes a key design focus.

67
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,439
Then we gotta talk
about wicked validation.

68
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:16,760
Wicked AKA.

69
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:22,450
Worst case execution time grows
exponentially harder to verify.

70
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,940
In a multi-core system, traditional
single core analysis no longer applies,

71
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,280
which means we need or require new
tools and measurement based approaches.

72
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,369
The certification challenge isn't
just technical, it's procedural.

73
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:42,469
Success means combining innovative
analysis methods with early

74
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,830
continuous collaboration with
certification authorities.

75
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:51,590
Let's talk about the frameworks to
certify multi-core avionic software.

76
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:57,710
We rely on two key frameworks, do 1 7,
8 C that we all know of and so used to,

77
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,819
and C 32 a. Together, they define the
foundation and the specialized guidance

78
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:06,009
needed for modern multi-core systems.

79
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:07,799
What is D 1 7 8 C?

80
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:12,799
That's the foundation D one seven eight C
software consideration in airborne systems

81
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:17,959
and equipment certification that set the
baseline for air airborne software safety.

82
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:23,929
It defines desu design assurance
levels A to E, guiding the rigor

83
00:05:23,929 --> 00:05:25,429
of development and verification.

84
00:05:25,929 --> 00:05:29,770
It also establishes expectations
for verification and validation,

85
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:35,140
configuration management and quality
assurance, ensuring traceability

86
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,239
and integrity throughout the cycle.

87
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:38,489
CAS 32.

88
00:05:38,489 --> 00:05:42,359
A guidance issued by the
certification authorities focuses

89
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:44,335
on multi-course specific challenges.

90
00:05:44,835 --> 00:05:48,494
It addresses interference,
mitigation, timing analysis,

91
00:05:48,645 --> 00:05:50,804
and resource usage validation.

92
00:05:51,304 --> 00:05:55,474
It also outlines documentation
expectations to demonstrate control and

93
00:05:55,474 --> 00:05:57,544
predictability in multi-core environments.

94
00:05:58,044 --> 00:06:01,400
In short, D 1 7 8 C provides the what?

95
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:06,744
The foundation for certification
and C 32 A provides The how

96
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:08,364
for multi-core compliance.

97
00:06:09,265 --> 00:06:14,424
Applying both ensures safe,
certifiable, and high performance

98
00:06:14,424 --> 00:06:16,074
multi-core avionic systems.

99
00:06:16,574 --> 00:06:20,264
So the C 32 A, which is the position
paper, defines the objectives

100
00:06:20,264 --> 00:06:23,264
and mitigation expectations
for multi-core processors.

101
00:06:24,194 --> 00:06:28,454
And then e aa, which is the European
jurisdiction, they issued something called

102
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:32,924
the A MC 20 dash 1 93, which is acceptable
means of compliance for multi-core.

103
00:06:33,614 --> 00:06:37,424
It supersedes the C 30 A for
applicants in the ESR jurisdiction.

104
00:06:38,384 --> 00:06:40,064
FAA also.

105
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:47,999
Sent out an advisory circular AC 20 dash
1 93 back in 2024, which is fas acceptable

106
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:52,644
means of compliance, which aligns
with the AMC 20 dash 1 21 93 though.

107
00:06:53,144 --> 00:06:54,964
All right, certification
objective summary.

108
00:06:55,734 --> 00:07:01,374
Let's talk more about these early
multicore processing, pro multicore

109
00:07:01,374 --> 00:07:04,934
processor planning and hardware
characterization is very important.

110
00:07:05,434 --> 00:07:09,204
Resource usage, budgeting and
partitioning, demonstrating

111
00:07:09,204 --> 00:07:15,954
wicked bounds under interference,
error detection, handling for MCP

112
00:07:15,954 --> 00:07:21,284
specific falls and producing an MA
multi-core processor accomplishment

113
00:07:21,284 --> 00:07:22,544
Summary for this CER authority.

114
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:27,304
In safety, critical avionics
partitioning is essential to protect

115
00:07:27,304 --> 00:07:32,434
critical robotic control processes
from lower criticality functions.

116
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:38,705
The goal prevent failures from crossing,
design assurance levels, boundaries, and

117
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:40,955
maintain predictable system behavior.

118
00:07:41,455 --> 00:07:42,955
Spatial partitioning.

119
00:07:43,205 --> 00:07:47,614
This assigns dedicated memory regions
to each functions prevents unauthorized

120
00:07:47,614 --> 00:07:51,754
access or data corruption between
partitions, which are crucial.

121
00:07:52,744 --> 00:07:54,604
Then comes temporal partitioning.

122
00:07:55,295 --> 00:08:00,905
This uses time sliced execution to ensure
every critical task gets guaranteed.

123
00:08:00,905 --> 00:08:01,474
CPU access.

124
00:08:01,974 --> 00:08:05,004
This maintains deterministic
performance even under high load.

125
00:08:05,504 --> 00:08:07,004
And then comes resource allocation.

126
00:08:07,504 --> 00:08:13,234
Careful core and cash allocation reduces
interference between partitions, optimizes

127
00:08:13,234 --> 00:08:15,364
performance while maintaining isolation.

128
00:08:15,864 --> 00:08:19,945
Then comes the validation, testing,
robustness and stress testing.

129
00:08:19,945 --> 00:08:25,075
Verify that partitions remain secure
and stable under all conditions.

130
00:08:25,945 --> 00:08:29,785
Confirms the integrity of safety
boundaries before certification.

131
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:33,045
Effective partitioning, underpins
both safety and reliability.

132
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,760
It's the foundation for certifiable,
multi-core robotic avionic systems.

133
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,880
Let's talk about interference channels.

134
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,020
Multi-core architectures introduce
interference channels that can

135
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,560
impact timing and pre predictability
of safety critical systems.

136
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,940
Understanding these channels
is essential for certification

137
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,710
and robust systems design.

138
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,830
Then comes cash interference.

139
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,670
Shared L two or L three
caches can EV affect data

140
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,190
unexpectedly affecting execution.

141
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:06,160
Timing of critical task, multiple core
accessing memories simultaneously can

142
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,650
create weight states delaying execution.

143
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,410
Peripheral access, right?

144
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:14,319
Shared IO controllers and DMA
channels may slow down critical

145
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:16,360
operations, if not managed carefully.

146
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,030
So core to core.

147
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:22,755
Communications across the interconnect
fabric adds unpredictable latency

148
00:09:22,755 --> 00:09:27,035
to distributed functions, mitigating
these interference channels through

149
00:09:27,035 --> 00:09:32,635
partitioning the right scheduling,
and the measurement based analysis

150
00:09:32,695 --> 00:09:36,375
is key to ensuring deterministic
behavior in multi-core avionics.

151
00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:42,885
We also need the right set of tools, the
right operating system and vendor support.

152
00:09:43,385 --> 00:09:46,625
Successful multi-core avionics
development relies on a combination

153
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,315
of all of those RTAs, okay?

154
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:52,135
A real-time operating system
with multi-core partitioning.

155
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:57,525
Example, like the integrity 1 78
UMP proven in early multi-core

156
00:09:57,525 --> 00:10:01,365
certification programs provides strong
spatial and temporal partitioning.

157
00:10:01,865 --> 00:10:05,605
Essential for safety critical
applications, timing analysis, and

158
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:10,885
measurement suites like tools like
rapida, LDRA, vendor Tool chains and

159
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:15,865
vendor specific profilers help analyze
execution time, and verify worst

160
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,285
case execution times test harnesses.

161
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:22,635
Similar to TTC N'S support
structured repeatable test campaigns.

162
00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:29,730
Hardware assisted tracing and
monitoring is a must have ETM or PTM

163
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:35,490
based tracing platform configuration
managements and QOS monitors enable deep

164
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,020
visibility into multi-cloud behavior.

165
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,145
These tools help detect interference,
validate timing, and ensure predictable

166
00:10:42,145 --> 00:10:44,655
operation combining partition artis.

167
00:10:45,155 --> 00:10:50,045
Measurement tools and hardware
tracing ensures multi-core avionics

168
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:55,085
can really meet both performance
and certification requirements.

169
00:10:55,585 --> 00:10:57,925
Let's talk about the certification
strategy for electric

170
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:00,285
aircraft phase one, right?

171
00:11:00,615 --> 00:11:03,855
Electric aircraft programs or
adopting proven certification method.

172
00:11:04,395 --> 00:11:06,705
To safely deploy multicore
while staying compliant?

173
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:10,435
The phase one part of it is
defining partitioning strategies

174
00:11:10,435 --> 00:11:11,995
to isolate critical functions.

175
00:11:12,495 --> 00:11:18,045
Selecting a certified OSH with multicore
support to ensure a strong foundation

176
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:19,545
for creative critical software.

177
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:25,890
Phase two, you get into the analysis part,
perform performing interference analysis

178
00:11:26,255 --> 00:11:29,015
to understand shared resource effects.

179
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:31,295
Start interference characterization.

180
00:11:31,295 --> 00:11:34,315
In parallel with software
development ed work streams basically

181
00:11:35,245 --> 00:11:38,365
automate instrumentation and
regression under stress harnesses.

182
00:11:39,235 --> 00:11:44,465
Establish timing budgets following
cast 32 a. Guidance phase

183
00:11:44,465 --> 00:11:46,065
three is our integration phase.

184
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:50,640
Use measurement based validation to
verify worst case execution times

185
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,410
ensure comprehensive test coverage
across platform and test scenarios.

186
00:11:56,265 --> 00:11:57,795
Test stress scenarios.

187
00:11:58,295 --> 00:12:02,315
Phase four is certification
compiler, evidence packages,

188
00:12:02,315 --> 00:12:04,235
demonstrating compile compliance.

189
00:12:04,445 --> 00:12:08,495
This is no different to what we
do on the D 1 7 8 C route that

190
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:12,515
we are doing on all the other
avionics platforms these days com.

191
00:12:12,725 --> 00:12:17,165
Having the right amount of evidence
packaged together is very important.

192
00:12:17,465 --> 00:12:20,405
In some cases use using
vendor provided certification.

193
00:12:20,405 --> 00:12:25,325
PA packages again, when available
can help shorten evidence gathering

194
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:31,094
or generation engaging certification
authorities early and continuously

195
00:12:31,425 --> 00:12:33,074
will help streamline the approval.

196
00:12:33,074 --> 00:12:33,165
One.

197
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:38,189
Following these four phases accelerates
multiple multi-core adoption.

198
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:43,870
While ensuring safety, predictability,
and regulatory compliance, robotic

199
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,189
control system integration.

200
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,920
There's the critical considerations here.

201
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,379
Robotic control systems rely on precise
timing and deterministic execution.

202
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:57,569
Every control loop must behave
predictably, especially in

203
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:01,949
safety critical domains like
drones or autonomous vehicles.

204
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:06,529
On modern multicore platforms,
maintaining those realtime guarantees

205
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:08,810
becomes both essential and challenging.

206
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:15,099
Sensor data from imus cameras and
lighter must be processed in real time.

207
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:18,704
Assigning sensor fusion to
dedicated course prevent timing

208
00:13:18,704 --> 00:13:20,640
jitter cost by other processes.

209
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:24,959
This ensures consistent data
availability for control loops.

210
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:29,479
Flight control laws with
guaranteed response times core

211
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:34,430
flight control algorithms demand
fixed low latency response.

212
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:39,739
Realtime scheduling and task
prioritization are vital to ensure

213
00:13:39,739 --> 00:13:43,699
control commands are computed and
applied within strict deadlines.

214
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,630
Even microsecond delays
can affect stability.

215
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,010
Autonomous decision making
with temporal isolation.

216
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:56,040
High level autonomy, like path
planning, obstacle avoidance, things

217
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,860
like that should not interfere
with low level control loops.

218
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:04,170
Temporal and spatial isolation
ensures that computationally have

219
00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:06,480
we AI tasks don't delay a time.

220
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,800
Critical control.

221
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,110
Threats fail.

222
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,030
Safe monitoring without interference.

223
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,200
Safety monitors and watch docs must
continuously check system health,

224
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:21,010
but without introducing any extra
latency, use separate cores or realtime

225
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:25,480
partitions to guarantee independence
and quick recovery in fault condition.

226
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,760
In short, successful integration of
robotic control systems and multiple

227
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:36,060
multi-core platforms depends on real time
determinism, isolation and fault decision.

228
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,799
Balancing performance and
predictability is the key to achieving

229
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:42,229
reliable, safe robotics behavior.

230
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:46,099
We gotta talk about documentation
and evidence For multi-core

231
00:14:46,099 --> 00:14:50,979
safety certification, authorities
require clear defensible evidence.

232
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,910
That multi-core systems meet safety
and determinism requirements.

233
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,790
No different to the other ones
that we've needed all along,

234
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,350
even with a single core system.

235
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,930
But this just means more.

236
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:08,380
The goal is to show not just performance,
but predictable behavior under all

237
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,260
operating condition becomes a major point.

238
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,490
We gotta talk about interference analysis.

239
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,970
Start with the comprehensive
interference assessment.

240
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:17,480
Assessment.

241
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,600
Across shared resources, cash,
memory, buses, memory buses, and io.

242
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,080
Identify all potential
interference channels and describe

243
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,950
mitigation strategies such as
partitioning or bandwidth control.

244
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:33,210
This forms the foundation for
demonstrating multi-course safety.

245
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:38,580
Timing reports provide wicked validation
with confidence levels and margins.

246
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,880
The reports should show consistent
timing under load and justify that

247
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,570
real-time deadlines remain intact
even during contention in and test

248
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:54,320
results include robustness and stress
testing resulting results to prove that

249
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,270
partitioning mechanisms are effecti.

250
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:02,500
Show that once one course heavy workload
does not degrade another's timing or

251
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,860
safety performance, these results are
key to demonstrating practical isolation.

252
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,620
Finally, the compliance matrix and
certification artifacts present

253
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,824
a compliance matrix mapping
each cast 32, a objective to

254
00:16:16,824 --> 00:16:18,384
corresponding verification evidence.

255
00:16:18,884 --> 00:16:21,884
Include tool qualification
data for any automated tools

256
00:16:21,884 --> 00:16:23,414
used in analysis of testing.

257
00:16:23,914 --> 00:16:27,574
Summarize all evidence in the
multi-core certification plan.

258
00:16:27,574 --> 00:16:33,604
Accomplishment summary, ensuring full
traceability to DO 1 78 C. Objectives,

259
00:16:34,104 --> 00:16:39,119
strong documentation and traceability
are vital as the technical design itself.

260
00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:43,309
A well structured evidence package
gives certification authorities

261
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:48,079
confidence in the system's safety,
determinism and compliance.

262
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:51,789
Let's talk about some of the common
pitfalls and how to avoid them.

263
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:54,629
Let working with multi-core
avionics, certain assumptions

264
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:56,099
can lead to costly setbacks.

265
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:59,879
Let's highlight a few common
pitfalls and how I provide them.

266
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:02,149
Single core versus multi-core OTs.

267
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:08,479
Don't ever again, don't ever assume single
core wickeds or worst case execution

268
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:10,159
Time applies to multi-core systems.

269
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:12,049
Shared resources.

270
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:16,149
Cost interferences, meaning multi-core
timing can be very different.

271
00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:19,319
Second one is late platform selection.

272
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:24,135
Choosing your hardware platform
too late can cause major rework.

273
00:17:24,635 --> 00:17:29,225
Early platform decisions enable realistic
testing and timing validation sooner.

274
00:17:29,725 --> 00:17:32,635
Thirdly, incomplete interference testing.

275
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:38,345
Insufficient stress testing, leaves
hidden timing conflicts, uses

276
00:17:38,345 --> 00:17:41,975
stress metrics that covers all
combinations of shared resources,

277
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:43,805
and ensure that you have enough.

278
00:17:44,305 --> 00:17:46,060
So what is the solution?

279
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,530
Introduce hardware in the loop
testing as early as possible.

280
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:55,410
Use interference generators to
expose timing issues, leverage tools,

281
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,340
support or trace analysis for deeper
visibility into system behavior.

282
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,330
By addressing these pitfalls, early teams
can reduce rework, improve predictability,

283
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,940
and accelerate certification readiness.

284
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,925
I just wanted to show you guys a case
study here, the P 3000 Multi-Core

285
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:15,185
Certification success Story.

286
00:18:15,685 --> 00:18:21,295
The P 3000 from CMC electronics
represents a major milestone in avionics.

287
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:27,295
It's one of the very first platforms to
achieve civil multi-core certification to

288
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:33,045
D 1 78 C dll level A. This certification
demonstrate that multi-core processors

289
00:18:33,105 --> 00:18:38,145
can certainly meet the highest level
of safety assurance in civil aviation.

290
00:18:38,645 --> 00:18:42,465
The key points here are, the P
3000 integrates the integrity one

291
00:18:42,465 --> 00:18:45,730
70 A-T-U-M-P realtime operating
system from Greenhill software.

292
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,440
That the R task provides temporal
and spatial partitioning,

293
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,950
ensuring predictable deterministic
performance across multiple core.

294
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:57,830
The project provided real certification
evidence addressing CAST 32 a. Objectives

295
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,820
such as interference analysis, timing
validation, and core isolation.

296
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,400
It demonstrated that D 1 7 8 C DA a
compliance is achievable on multi-core

297
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:12,740
hardware and supported by rigorous
design verification and documentation.

298
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,980
So this P 3000 certification sets
a practical precedence for future

299
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,420
multi-core avionics programs.

300
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,960
It proves that with the right
architecture, verification strategy,

301
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:27,220
safety, critical multi-core
systems can certainly achieve full

302
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:31,150
certification without compromising
performance of predictability.

303
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,880
So what's the path forward?

304
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,110
Multicore Avionics are the
foundation of next generation

305
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,690
robotics driven aerospace system.

306
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,190
They deliver the processing power
needed for autonomy, AI if need

307
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,770
be, and complex mission functions,
balancing innovation and safety, right?

308
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,310
Innovation must be matched with
rigorous safety and certification

309
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,595
discipline, which is a must for.

310
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,260
Aircraft systems, we must integrate
new technologies without ever

311
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,840
compromising reliability or compliance.

312
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,790
Use trusted partitioning methods
to isolate critical functions.

313
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:07,930
This ensures false or contained and safety
critical task remain protected with them.

314
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:11,820
Apply measurement based timing
analysis to validate a real time

315
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:16,085
performance paired with comprehensive
test coverage to ensure predictable

316
00:20:16,285 --> 00:20:17,605
behavior and under all conditions.

317
00:20:17,905 --> 00:20:23,215
The most important part, early and
continuous engagement with certification

318
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:27,115
Authorities involve certification
bodies early in the development phase.

319
00:20:27,615 --> 00:20:31,815
Maintain an open continuous dialogue
through streamline approval and

320
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:34,085
reduce rework the path forward.

321
00:20:34,085 --> 00:20:37,655
Combines innovation, safety,
and collaboration by following

322
00:20:37,655 --> 00:20:39,725
these three principles.

323
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:45,560
We can confidently advance toward an
intelligent autonomous aerospace future.

324
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,480
I would like to leave you all with
an example certification plan.

325
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,360
Basically, it's a recap of everything
that we've talked about so far.

326
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:57,580
The first phase is the selection
of the right platform, the R task,

327
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,460
making sure that you have the
multi-core risk assessment completed.

328
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,970
Platform characterization
and interference map.

329
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,930
Partitioning and resource
budgets are defined, which

330
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,640
includes time, memory, and io.

331
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:14,990
First case execution time analysis, under
interference testing, integration test

332
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:20,810
metrics, error handling verifications,
and finally, the multi-core processor

333
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,270
accomplishment, summary and submission.

334
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:27,940
If you have any questions or would like
to discuss anything on this topic, please.

335
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,800
Feel free to reach out to me.

336
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:30,790
Thank you all.
