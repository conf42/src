00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
Hello everyone, and thank
you for joining today.

2
00:00:03,195 --> 00:00:06,375
Today we'll explore how government
agencies are embracing cloud

3
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:11,445
technologies to digitally transform
their operation, improve citizen

4
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:16,425
engagement, and also how to optimize
internal efficiency, especially

5
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:18,375
using Salesforce government Cloud.

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,179
So this session is filled with real
data points that we have collected, so

7
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:28,339
far with success Metrices and a forward
looking view into what's next for the

8
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:30,319
public sector digital transformation.

9
00:00:30,819 --> 00:00:35,169
So why there is a need for
transformation in public agencies.

10
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:39,489
So currently, as public agencies
are under increasing pressure to

11
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:44,739
modernize their tech stack and,
also to modernize their outdated.

12
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:52,239
Systems and to meet rising citizens
expectations and also to deliver services

13
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,369
with greater transparency and speed.

14
00:00:54,849 --> 00:01:00,519
So from 2020 to 2023, cloud adoption
in the public sector grows by 72%.

15
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:07,619
You know how much demand there
is for GCP or AWS or even, Azure.

16
00:01:08,199 --> 00:01:12,429
so there is almost a 72% increase in.

17
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:19,240
From 2020 to 2023, signaling a strong,
digitalization driving the shift,

18
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,010
our demands for, better service,
accessibility, strong efficiency

19
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,810
and crisis responsiveness, legacy
systems are no longer sustainable.

20
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:34,905
And those have high costs in maintenance
and also digital push platforms like

21
00:01:34,905 --> 00:01:37,750
Salesforce are helping to bridge the gaps.

22
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,370
So why Salesforce?

23
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,180
Government cloud.

24
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,740
So Salesforce Government Cloud is
built to meet the unique security

25
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,540
compliances and scalability
needs of public sector entities.

26
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,700
So it has federal and compliant
infrastructure to ensure strict adherence

27
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,190
to federal cybersecurity standards.

28
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:04,020
And also 99 per 99.95% security compliance
rate demonstrate high reliability,

29
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,650
and it also has a S 2 56 encryption.

30
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:12,560
For data addressed and TLS
1.3 for data in transit.

31
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,760
So role based access controls
and a multi-tenant architecture,

32
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,160
improve resource utilization by
70 per 71% and also virtually ate,

33
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,860
crossed and data leakage by 99%.

34
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,070
So what are the, real world,
impacts metrics using, Salesforce?

35
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,560
agencies are seeing major improvement.

36
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,580
That have already been using, Salesforce.

37
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,200
So one, one is the permit processing
time has dropped from 15 days to

38
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,930
just three point, 3, 2, 2 0.3 days.

39
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,520
by using Salesforce AI and also
administrative overhead costs

40
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,805
have been slashed by 67% due to
digitalization and automation.

41
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,590
So now agencies can also handle
three times more, service request

42
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,250
without increasing headcount
and still maintain a 91.

43
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,940
Percent, service accuracy

44
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,250
and also the omnichannel communications,
the emergency notifications

45
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,050
and AI powered self service.

46
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,690
All these will be, adhering, to
lower the time for self resolution

47
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,660
of cases, and also will, reduce.

48
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:26,100
The, low hanging cases when a citizen
opens a case, using Salesforce, when the

49
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,870
agencies are using the government cloud.

50
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,860
And also the operation Excellence,
has also been improved, a lot, by

51
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,870
automation, and also by using, internal
workflows and flows within Salesforce.

52
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,690
So every day, 18,500 transactions
are processed to automated approval

53
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,920
chain, so there is no manual.

54
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,430
Intervention of people or the
government employees, to, manually,

55
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,830
approve, or reject the data.

56
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,070
So by this, the number of cases
handled every day by the agencies

57
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,560
has improved a lot and the citizens
are also pretty happy on, on looking

58
00:04:03,565 --> 00:04:08,570
at the results and also the smart
routing, powered by machine learning,

59
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,365
reduced, misdirect, requests are also.

60
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,010
Improved.

61
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:17,420
And, the SLM monitoring with automated
escalations, results, potential

62
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,430
violation within required timeframes.

63
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,210
intelligent resource, management,
resource allocation is now, data driven.

64
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:28,760
so staff utilization has improved by 52%.

65
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:33,639
and also AI forecasting achieves
88.5% accuracy, helping agents.

66
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:37,870
This, anticipate and, balance the
workload and also hire efficiently.

67
00:04:38,859 --> 00:04:42,034
So service select bottles and
bottle service delivery bottlenecks

68
00:04:42,034 --> 00:04:44,020
are also reduced by 42.5%.

69
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,054
So predictive maintenance saves
medium sized departments, 1.8

70
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:53,200
million annually, thanks to a 75.3
reduction in unplanned downtime.

71
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,519
So the crisis management,
readiness during emerging.

72
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,929
Salesforce provide a
coordinated, scalable response.

73
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:05,599
A unified crisis dashboard cut
average response time by 55, 54 0.2%.

74
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:10,569
system, managed 12,000 plus concurrent
incident report without data loss.

75
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:17,009
And the 81.7% improvement in resource
allocation, ensures help reaches where

76
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:20,969
it's needed the most improved message,
delivery success across vulnerable

77
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,059
population from 76 to 94.5 percentage.

78
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:25,409
So data driven.

79
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,279
Decision making.

80
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:29,879
Salesforce enables smarter
governments through analytics.

81
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:33,809
Also, advanced algorithms
and realtime data.

82
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,549
realtime data dashboards improve
operational efficiencies while, for

83
00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:43,039
2.7 percentage departments report
average annual saying of 22.1 million.

84
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,559
agencies now predict citizen and
demand are ate anomaly early and

85
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:48,909
are just purchased proactively.

86
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:50,369
So how does.

87
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,229
All this happened.

88
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:56,389
So Salesforce have seamless
integrations, and advanced security

89
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:58,729
integration and interability.

90
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:02,579
these are pretty, critical, when you
are using advanced infrastructure.

91
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:08,359
So APIs, through APIs, there is decre,
the request latency is decreased,

92
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:12,919
and also the response variation
is also reduced by 43 point 42.3

93
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:15,919
percentage data migration is accurate.

94
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:17,279
so that no data is.

95
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:20,264
Is lost, during the transitions
from old system to new system.

96
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:24,809
And also mobile infrastructure
supports eight 50 K request, per day

97
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:27,449
at 0.9 seconds average response time.

98
00:06:28,049 --> 00:06:34,049
So multilayered security data detects
99.8% of data breaches across 1.2 million

99
00:06:34,049 --> 00:06:36,419
transactions daily per each, agency.

100
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:42,249
So what is, what does the, future,
outlook, capabilities, look like?

101
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,379
So ai, all AI models.

102
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:48,099
Now deliver 92.7 accurately in
platform recognition and prediction.

103
00:06:48,294 --> 00:06:54,699
Blockchain and IOT configurations have
improvement data by 94.1 percentage and

104
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:59,599
advanced analytics improved, resource
allocation efficiency by 51.8 percentage.

105
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,869
And enhanced security now prevents 99.97
percentage of unauthorized systems.

106
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:11,879
So not only does every agency, can
use, AI powered, service agents.

107
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:17,839
so that whenever, a citizen or anybody
using a service, by the government

108
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:22,309
agencies, they can, when once they
create a case, or any kind of request,

109
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,449
the AI agents, will automatically,
solve the low hanging foods.

110
00:07:27,859 --> 00:07:33,460
once this happens, the number of cases,
created, as the number of cases, creation

111
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,600
increases more, the response time.

112
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,280
Will also be decreased because
of even of AI powered services.

113
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,975
so once these AI powered services are
introduced, into the government cloud

114
00:07:43,975 --> 00:07:47,570
by the agencies, the low hanging cases
will be resolved and the regular,

115
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,395
regularly, created cases by different
citizens, will be automatically

116
00:07:52,395 --> 00:07:53,835
resolved by looking at the history.

117
00:07:54,335 --> 00:07:59,085
So overall, the next generation
government cloud, will have more

118
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:00,795
security enhancements and more.

119
00:08:00,945 --> 00:08:05,975
AI capabilities, so that even, with
many cases, created many backlog

120
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:07,205
cases that are already there.

121
00:08:07,525 --> 00:08:12,735
there is a significantly, less,
turnaround time and also the resolution

122
00:08:12,795 --> 00:08:19,185
is within, minutes and it does not take
days, for the already, created cases.

123
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:20,355
Thank you.
