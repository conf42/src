1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,690
Hello everyone and thank
you for joining me today.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,160
My name is Heh Bja and I'm a software
engineering leader creating enterprise

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,290
software solution from the last 15 years.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,870
Currently my work is focused on HCM and
FinTech space, creating solution that

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,880
provide small and the medium business
workers, which are SMBs the backbone

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:25,099
for US economy with the tools they
need to focus on their jobs without.

7
00:00:25,549 --> 00:00:27,619
Taking the burden for
the financial stress.

8
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:33,349
The topic for our session is how
to architect Scalable platform for

9
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:38,269
financial wellness for employees through
the HCM and the FinTech integration.

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,080
This is just not a technical
problem to solve or a challenge.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,269
This is a growing financial stress
into the ecosystem industry.

12
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:49,769
For employees and they're directly
impacting their productivity

13
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:55,349
engagement and also impacting
employer for the employer retention.

14
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,359
Traditionally, HCM system
often operates in the isolation

15
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,429
from financial wellness tools.

16
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:03,589
What are we going to explore today?

17
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:05,149
How to bridge that gap?

18
00:01:05,539 --> 00:01:09,945
Build a unique opportunity to
reimagine how workforce data and the

19
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,989
financial insight can work together.

20
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:14,599
To create a meaningful
employee experience.

21
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:19,519
So let's spend some time, maybe 15,
20 minutes with deep dive into the

22
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,959
business use cases for this integration,
the technical architecture required

23
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:29,119
to build our scalable and the secure
platform, the core principles, and

24
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:30,799
some of the business use cases.

25
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:35,669
Let's start with the business use case,
the impact for the financial asset.

26
00:01:36,169 --> 00:01:39,679
The impact for the financial stresses
are very much well documented.

27
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:45,539
Employees who are experiences financial
difficulties demonstrate decreased

28
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:50,070
focus, increase healthcare utilization,
and the higher turnover rates.

29
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,719
The core issue of the problem
is the missed opportunities.

30
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:59,240
Here, most enterprise architecture treat
workforce management and the financial

31
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,059
wellness as a completely separate domain.

32
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:07,129
They work in isolation, meaning the missed
critical chances to provide intervention

33
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:12,110
and support when needed the most to
the workers on the technical front.

34
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:16,784
All modernized enterprise must
navigate complex requirement,

35
00:02:17,144 --> 00:02:21,854
maintain strict privacy standards,
and ensure a seamless user experience

36
00:02:21,885 --> 00:02:26,894
across a variety of different and
often cross-functional use cases.

37
00:02:27,394 --> 00:02:31,679
To build our effective platform, we
need a strong technical foundation.

38
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:37,629
There are few core pillars for the
architecture that we have to follow.

39
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:42,939
Whenever actually we are thinking about to
moving any data, we need a sophisticated

40
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:48,129
data orchestration layer, which just goes
beyond the traditional ETL processes.

41
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:53,159
A key part of this is privacy
design as we deal with the employee

42
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,170
data, which is more sensitive.

43
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,239
We want to make sure that all our platform
are deal with the privacy and security in

44
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,700
the mind from the day one central of this
is the event driven communication pattern.

45
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:11,040
All the modernized platform
need real data for the workforce

46
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,170
event, like when employee salary
changes new benefit enrollments.

47
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,220
They move, that means their
effective dating are changing their

48
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:23,149
performance reviews, which can trigger
the relevant financial wellness

49
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,489
intervention or an opportunity.

50
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:31,160
Our communication layer must handle
both synchronous and the asynchronous

51
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,570
pattern effectively, and we can achieve
this using even streaming platform

52
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,950
like Kafka, which is widely used
across the industries as the backbone

53
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,720
for our hybrid communication model.

54
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,630
When we architect the system, we can
leverage a number of proven design

55
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,269
pattern to address specific challenges.

56
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,470
These are not unique.

57
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:53,859
This has been used in the multiple
industries, so we can learn from there.

58
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,850
Number one is architecture,
which allow us.

59
00:03:58,345 --> 00:04:02,874
That how are core business logic to
remain independent of the integrations

60
00:04:03,264 --> 00:04:07,975
providing the clear interfaces for
the external system for integration.

61
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:12,715
This is vital for a system that connect
with the various different providers.

62
00:04:13,585 --> 00:04:17,755
Second is the API Gateway pattern,
which provides a single entry

63
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:22,375
point for all of our integration
offering unified authentication,

64
00:04:22,735 --> 00:04:24,090
how to throttle the request rail.

65
00:04:24,745 --> 00:04:26,184
And monitor and tracking.

66
00:04:26,964 --> 00:04:30,714
The lastly is circuit brick
or circuit breaker pattern,

67
00:04:30,714 --> 00:04:32,125
which is crucial for stability.

68
00:04:32,544 --> 00:04:37,885
It's prevent cascading failures and ensure
graceful degradation of functionality.

69
00:04:38,214 --> 00:04:40,854
When a connected system
experiences any issue.

70
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:44,324
In case of any failure, we can
look into more advanced topic

71
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:48,829
like data mesh architecture for
organization with complex data needs.

72
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:53,889
Privacy and the security consolidation,
as I said in the past, these are

73
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:57,789
the must consolidation we should
take Whenever we're talking about

74
00:04:58,179 --> 00:05:00,189
the HCM and the financial system.

75
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,349
Whenever we're dealing with the
employee financial data, privacy

76
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:05,879
and security are paramount.

77
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:07,489
We should adopt.

78
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:11,719
In fact, we must adopt a zero
trust architecture, authenticating

79
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:13,640
authorization, each and every request.

80
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:15,979
We should know regardless of.

81
00:05:16,354 --> 00:05:17,374
What is the source?

82
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:18,844
Who is trying to accept the data?

83
00:05:19,264 --> 00:05:22,984
This provides the gran control, which
is essential for the financial data.

84
00:05:23,554 --> 00:05:26,434
We should also implement
multi-layer encryption.

85
00:05:26,854 --> 00:05:30,034
We should encrypt data
at all stages and rest.

86
00:05:30,994 --> 00:05:35,944
While in transit, even while in use
through the advanced encryption techniques

87
00:05:36,424 --> 00:05:41,614
token piece authentication, which also
allows to support custom roles find

88
00:05:41,614 --> 00:05:46,534
grade and access control, and with
token scope to the specific data types.

89
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:51,034
And finally, we must
practice data minimization.

90
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:56,314
We should actively minimize data exchange
to only what is absolutely necessary

91
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,054
for the specific business functions.

92
00:05:58,554 --> 00:06:01,194
Let's talk about what AI.

93
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,804
Can play a role here.

94
00:06:03,254 --> 00:06:06,884
AI can make those systems more proactive.

95
00:06:07,094 --> 00:06:10,994
It can transform our reactive
financial wellness program into

96
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:12,944
our proactive intervention systems.

97
00:06:13,275 --> 00:06:18,254
By analyzing the pattern, by looking
into the workforce data and the financial

98
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:23,874
behavior, AI model can definitely
identify employees who are at risk for

99
00:06:23,874 --> 00:06:28,824
financial stress before it become a
crisis for them and impact their home.

100
00:06:29,324 --> 00:06:30,194
Capabilities.

101
00:06:30,554 --> 00:06:33,854
We can also do this without
centralized sensitive data by using

102
00:06:34,304 --> 00:06:36,254
federating learning approaches.

103
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:41,924
AI can also leverage NLP techniques
to analyze communication pattern for

104
00:06:41,954 --> 00:06:46,604
stress indicator and a behavioral
analytics to extent beyond direct

105
00:06:46,604 --> 00:06:51,984
financial data to include metrics
like productivity sick leave.

106
00:06:52,374 --> 00:06:55,254
These are, these are the scoring
and the metrics we should.

107
00:06:55,809 --> 00:06:58,869
Aligned to each and every
worker in their workforce.

108
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:03,279
The goal is to use realtime scoring
system to enable the immediate

109
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:05,829
response to identified risk factor.

110
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,919
The feedback loop is
very much critical here.

111
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:11,499
In fact, that's that's a key for the ai.

112
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:16,289
We learn from our system and continuously
refine the accuracy and effectiveness

113
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:17,909
for our AI models over time.

114
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:22,189
Another one of the important applications
for HCM FinTech integration is.

115
00:07:22,714 --> 00:07:23,824
Personalized nudging.

116
00:07:24,334 --> 00:07:29,164
We can leverage the combination of
workforce context and the financial

117
00:07:29,164 --> 00:07:33,754
data to deliver precise, timely,
and the very relevant information.

118
00:07:34,084 --> 00:07:38,854
For example, if I imply situation
changes, take example, they can

119
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:42,639
promote, then they need, immediate
changes to their retirement

120
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,299
contribution or some other financial
decision they have to take care of.

121
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:50,709
Or if something happened in their family
or there's a time for enrolled for the

122
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:55,254
new benefit or a new deadline, which
could change their personalized decisions.

123
00:07:55,704 --> 00:08:00,264
So these kind of situations we should
handle with the right kind of nudges.

124
00:08:00,684 --> 00:08:04,374
We should also look into the
behavioral economics also, and

125
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:08,784
also for the effective delivery, we
should use multi-channel approach.

126
00:08:08,844 --> 00:08:12,384
It can be SMS, it can be the mobile apps.

127
00:08:12,414 --> 00:08:17,124
It can be through the notification
also, so we can nudges worker

128
00:08:17,454 --> 00:08:20,169
with the right information at the
right time for all the workflows.

129
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:25,319
Moving beyond traditional batch processing
and even, even architecture enable

130
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:30,210
immediate response to the employee life
event as financial stress indicator

131
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,920
that we spoke about in the last site.

132
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,089
The key component of these architecture
includes event sourcing pattern that

133
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:40,809
captured the complete history of an
employee financial wellness journey.

134
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,029
Stream processing for real time analysis
of the workforce even as they occur.

135
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:51,069
And carefully design event schema that
support the evolution over the time.

136
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:55,359
By building a system with
massive durability, we ensure

137
00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:57,519
critical events are never lost.

138
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:01,419
This approach allows for the
powerful cross system correlation

139
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:04,779
connecting workforce, even with
the financial behavior pattern

140
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:06,549
to provide real time analysis.

141
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:09,179
Let's look into the microservice design.

142
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:14,279
The microservice design is the perfect for
this kind of platform because it's allowed

143
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:18,719
them to evolve rapidly while maintaining
the system reliability and scalability.

144
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:21,989
This is a particularly valuable
when we are integrating with.

145
00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:26,699
Diverse and complex set of and
the financial service provider.

146
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:30,839
We designed our service boundaries to
align with the business capabilities

147
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:33,089
rather than the technical consideration.

148
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:38,429
We have to find a balance between
performance and the reliability in

149
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:42,119
our interservice communication model.

150
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:46,199
Our API design should abstract
implementation details while

151
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:49,259
providing flexibility for
different integration scenarios.

152
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:54,999
For data consistency, we should
consider eventual consistency pattern

153
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:59,319
for appropriate data types and for our
surface discovery to enable dynamic

154
00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:04,059
scaling and the deployment pattern
that will handle the variable demands.

155
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,424
Our reality for our many enterprises
that the core system are legacy.

156
00:10:09,924 --> 00:10:15,174
We hardly change the system and upgrade
the system sometime as, as pricey,

157
00:10:15,174 --> 00:10:20,034
sometime as need more, more investment or
they're, they, they're hard to upgrade.

158
00:10:20,364 --> 00:10:23,274
This system often lacks
the modern API capability.

159
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:27,084
They are still using the old
data format and very limited

160
00:10:27,414 --> 00:10:29,034
real time integration option.

161
00:10:29,184 --> 00:10:30,924
So what are the solution approaches?

162
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:36,249
We can modernize our ETL with the
change data capture techniques and

163
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:40,209
build data transformation layer to
map between legacy format and the

164
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:43,149
modern API and use adapter pattern.

165
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:45,669
To isolate the legacy integration logic.

166
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:51,749
We must also accommodate batch processing
windows with catching strategies,

167
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:56,279
time to live and build a comprehensive
error handling and the retrial logic.

168
00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:00,199
Let's touch base a little bit
of compliance and regulatory

169
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:01,279
architecture, consolidation.

170
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,699
Also, compliance is not a side project.

171
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:05,539
It's it required.

172
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:09,169
It's a core architectural
consolidation, and we should adopt

173
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,269
it from the day one, like security.

174
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:16,429
We need a robust data governance
framework, and a consent management

175
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:19,429
is critical because we are talking
about the employee person leader.

176
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:20,329
We should.

177
00:11:21,109 --> 00:11:24,049
Take their consent to use their
data for the different purposes.

178
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:26,749
We need clear data retention policies.

179
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:31,669
Also that balance regulatory requirement
with operational needs using automated

180
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:36,829
management of prevent compliance
gap and also audit trails must that

181
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:41,659
must be in detail, inimitable to
support regulatory examiner and

182
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,159
the legal discovery processes.

183
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:47,839
We should build these capabilities into
our platform from start to reduce the

184
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,089
compliance burden and improve accuracy.

185
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:54,489
Whenever we serving the large
employee population, performance

186
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:56,799
optimization is a constant challenge.

187
00:11:57,219 --> 00:12:01,299
Our architecture decision
must anticipate peak uses.

188
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:06,009
When is the time where we have like the
high load, maybe the year end, maybe

189
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:10,349
the quarter trend, or maybe whenever
there payroll runs to talk about the

190
00:12:10,349 --> 00:12:14,219
peak while maintaining the responsive
performance during the normal operations?

191
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,229
Our scalability strategies include.

192
00:12:16,844 --> 00:12:20,594
Multi-tiered caching architecture
optimized for different users patterns,

193
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,914
database charting strategies that
account for the diverse access patterns,

194
00:12:25,214 --> 00:12:29,414
using CDNs for financial execution
materials and the load balancing

195
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:33,644
that considers the stateful nature
of financial wellness interactions.

196
00:12:34,064 --> 00:12:37,724
We must also ensure our performance
monitoring extent beyond simple

197
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:41,209
infrastructure metrics to include
business relevant measurements.

198
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:44,559
Let's look at a few examples
of this pattern in action.

199
00:12:45,369 --> 00:12:48,339
Let's talk about a healthcare
organization, a healthcare organization

200
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:52,749
that started small by connecting emergency
saving program to their payroll system.

201
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:57,249
This focus approach, established core
integration pattern and demonstrated

202
00:12:57,249 --> 00:13:01,389
value before they expanded to the more
complex feature resulting in significant

203
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:05,469
improvement in the employee financial
resilience, a technology company.

204
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:08,929
Leverage a microservice architecture
to create personalized financial

205
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:10,854
education program that adopted.

206
00:13:11,274 --> 00:13:16,254
To the employee career trajectories,
their event driven approach enable real

207
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:20,574
time responses to promotions and the
equity investing events, which improved

208
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:24,714
retirement saving participation, a
manufacturing organization that adopted

209
00:13:24,744 --> 00:13:29,244
adapted pattern to integrate modern
financial wellness capabilities without

210
00:13:29,244 --> 00:13:31,854
disturbing their established HR processes.

211
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:36,534
This shows how architecture pattern
can enable innovation even without

212
00:13:37,224 --> 00:13:38,664
within a constrained technical.

213
00:13:39,164 --> 00:13:43,694
Environment and a financial services
company face unique compliance challenges.

214
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,504
They use sophisticated consent
management and the data governance

215
00:13:47,504 --> 00:13:51,734
pattern to provide valuable
employee benefit while maintaining

216
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:53,624
the strict regulatory compliance.

217
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:59,184
I. As we look into the future, we'll
see separate ER emerging technologies

218
00:13:59,184 --> 00:14:03,594
that continue to shape this space,
including the advanced AI capabilities

219
00:14:03,624 --> 00:14:07,914
beyond simple pattern equalization,
blockchain for trust, transparency

220
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:09,774
in the quantum resistant encryption.

221
00:14:10,164 --> 00:14:13,584
We also anticipate greater API
standardization across the HM

222
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:15,054
and the FinTech industries.

223
00:14:15,594 --> 00:14:18,594
To build truly sustainable
platform, we need to follow

224
00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:20,064
some key success principles.

225
00:14:20,704 --> 00:14:25,144
Start with the career use case and the
success metrics designed for privacy

226
00:14:25,144 --> 00:14:27,034
and security from the beginning.

227
00:14:27,454 --> 00:14:31,894
Leverage event driven pattern for
responsiveness and maintain marginalized

228
00:14:31,894 --> 00:14:34,374
architecture that can support evolution.

229
00:14:34,764 --> 00:14:38,214
Ultimately, this integration is
more than just a technical project.

230
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:43,044
It isn't app opport to reimagine how
technology supports human potential.

231
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:45,234
Does take us to the end.

232
00:14:45,764 --> 00:14:46,694
Thank you so much.

233
00:14:46,694 --> 00:14:50,054
I appreciate you all
taking some time to listen.

234
00:14:50,294 --> 00:14:51,104
Thank you so much.
