00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:00,790
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:05,819
welcome to the talk on optimizing
retail forecasting through advanced AI

3
00:00:05,829 --> 00:00:09,000
models, the role of prompt engineering.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,829
in this talk, I'll be talking about
how the generative AI has had an impact

5
00:00:14,989 --> 00:00:20,765
in such a traditional field, such
as forecasting, where it was always

6
00:00:20,765 --> 00:00:24,375
thought about using statistical machine
learning and deep learning models.

7
00:00:24,794 --> 00:00:30,544
And now how these generative AI
applications can impact and enhance

8
00:00:30,574 --> 00:00:33,075
the development of these models.

9
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,225
Before getting into it, I'd
like to introduce myself.

10
00:00:36,635 --> 00:00:38,315
I'm Sijo Valek at Money Content.

11
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,495
I'm a data scientist with over
seven years of experience.

12
00:00:41,505 --> 00:00:46,249
Thank you And, I have experience
in, traditional ML, natural

13
00:00:46,249 --> 00:00:50,959
language processing and other,
areas within data science.

14
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:56,579
but, my primary focus and interest in
the past couple of years has been at

15
00:00:56,619 --> 00:01:02,909
forecasting at scale and how to use these
different areas to enhance forecasting

16
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:05,799
in the retail, QSR and other spaces.

17
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:12,799
I'm actively involved in research,
In bringing these multidisciplinary

18
00:01:13,169 --> 00:01:17,699
developments in AI and machine
learning into other fields.

19
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:22,079
and I've been a mentor to a few data
scientists, junior data scientists,

20
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:28,209
and I'm also part of several startup
accelerator programs on how to use AI,

21
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:33,799
to improve their businesses and also to
develop intelligent automation systems.

22
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:37,604
I have a Master of Science
from the University of Texas at

23
00:01:37,604 --> 00:01:40,324
Austin, and I am an engineer.

24
00:01:41,314 --> 00:01:47,324
yeah, so let's look into what
we are going to talk today.

25
00:01:47,824 --> 00:01:52,104
This is a quick overview of what
we'll be covering in today's talk.

26
00:01:52,564 --> 00:01:55,464
the first, I'll talk
about why do we forecast.

27
00:01:55,964 --> 00:02:02,104
We'll start by discussing the fundamental
reasons for forecasting in retail, such

28
00:02:02,104 --> 00:02:07,474
as predicting demand, optimizing inventory
and improving customer experience.

29
00:02:08,444 --> 00:02:13,384
Then I will go into the forecasting
challenges and then I will get to

30
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:18,364
the specific soft prompt engineering
and how prompt engineering can help.

31
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:19,999
forecasting.

32
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:25,209
So we will dive into how prop engineering
specifically applies to forecasting

33
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:29,279
covering techniques like chain of
thought, tree of thought, self refined

34
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:35,029
prompting, that can improve model
performance and forecasting accuracy.

35
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:41,019
finally, we'll explore emerging trends
and future possibilities in retail

36
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,539
forecasting, including integration
of external data, AI driven supply

37
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:52,284
chain, And fully automated forecasting
systems by the end You will have

38
00:02:52,354 --> 00:02:57,324
a comprehensive understanding of
how prompt engineering can ai Can

39
00:02:57,324 --> 00:02:59,714
enhance ai driven retail forecasting?

40
00:03:00,384 --> 00:03:05,924
and the exciting potential of these
advancements in retail industry,

41
00:03:06,424 --> 00:03:09,184
first Why do we forecast right?

42
00:03:09,744 --> 00:03:16,864
so we know that the retail value
chain is You Made up of flow of

43
00:03:16,894 --> 00:03:19,894
goods from manufacturers to consumer.

44
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:27,944
So if you take any goods let's say
for instance, let's take a t shirt It

45
00:03:27,944 --> 00:03:33,234
is being manufactured in a different
part usually Than then you buy a

46
00:03:33,234 --> 00:03:35,474
store right then you buy from store.

47
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:42,824
So this product flows from manufacturer
to the store through various channels,

48
00:03:42,854 --> 00:03:46,414
like there is a lot of transportation
involved, there's distribution

49
00:03:46,414 --> 00:03:51,444
involved, and then different modes of
transportation involved, or it could

50
00:03:51,444 --> 00:03:53,174
be in different order as well, right?

51
00:03:53,174 --> 00:03:58,374
I have shown a very simplified diagram
here with a few, one distribution

52
00:03:58,374 --> 00:04:04,754
center and a store, but it can get
extremely complicated with hundreds

53
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:06,864
of Intermediate steps, right?

54
00:04:06,864 --> 00:04:11,234
It could be, let's say, as complex
as to given one example, it could be

55
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:16,554
like a manufacturing plant somewhere
in China, and then the manufacturer

56
00:04:16,554 --> 00:04:21,054
ships the product, it goes through
road into a port, and then from the

57
00:04:21,064 --> 00:04:24,804
port, it could go into a ship, and
then from the ship, it could come to

58
00:04:24,884 --> 00:04:27,274
somewhere in, let's say, a port in China.

59
00:04:27,624 --> 00:04:32,384
europe or something right so then from
the port it's again traveling Via a

60
00:04:32,384 --> 00:04:35,884
truck or something to a distribution
center and then from the distribution

61
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:39,114
center It would go to another warehouse
sometimes and then from the warehouse.

62
00:04:39,114 --> 00:04:44,639
It will come to your Doorstep or it could
go to a store so it can get extremely

63
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:52,424
complex with respect to how a Good or
a product travels to consumers, right?

64
00:04:52,894 --> 00:05:00,434
so and this is one, so now That
we know like the value chain

65
00:05:00,964 --> 00:05:05,504
even there are other factors that
affects the retail landscape, right?

66
00:05:05,504 --> 00:05:11,984
You There are, we saw how there are
different components and when you have

67
00:05:12,074 --> 00:05:19,074
a lot of components, any uncertainty in
each of those components can affect, how

68
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:24,714
the consumers receive the product, like
imagine ordering something on, let's say,

69
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:27,404
e commerce website, like Amazon and, Okay.

70
00:05:27,904 --> 00:05:32,594
Amazon tells you the product
will reach you in, let's say,

71
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:34,254
one day or a two day, right?

72
00:05:34,264 --> 00:05:38,254
so you have the expectation, but
there's a lot of things going

73
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:44,014
on behind the scenes to get the
product on time to the consumers.

74
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:49,674
So it's extremely important to
forecast when it's going to reach and

75
00:05:49,674 --> 00:05:56,274
when So that the customers know when
it'll reach you and it is it leads

76
00:05:56,274 --> 00:06:01,164
to a lot of customer experience and
consumer satisfaction and developing

77
00:06:01,164 --> 00:06:03,174
a relationship with the customers.

78
00:06:03,674 --> 00:06:09,134
So one of the key challenges that
here is like we need to start

79
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:14,894
producing products way before the
anticipated demands in a lot of cases.

80
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:18,724
Let's say if you're talking about
a t shirt, it takes a while for

81
00:06:18,724 --> 00:06:20,574
the t shirts to get manufactured.

82
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:24,244
And even before manufacturing,
there's a product design involved.

83
00:06:24,254 --> 00:06:29,254
So the retailers want to,
predict the demand in advance.

84
00:06:29,754 --> 00:06:32,914
So that they could get
a head start, right?

85
00:06:33,294 --> 00:06:36,804
And another thing is, these
product designs and things like

86
00:06:36,804 --> 00:06:39,514
those are customer driven, right?

87
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:43,764
Like the, Maybe, I don't know, a gray
shirt might be trending with some

88
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:47,954
abstract design might be trending now,
but what is going to be trending, let's

89
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:52,234
say, one year from now, it's hard to
predict, but you can get census and

90
00:06:52,574 --> 00:06:57,994
fence from, the consumer behaviors and
also with respect to Omnichannel, like

91
00:06:57,994 --> 00:07:00,244
a lot of people are shopping online.

92
00:07:00,684 --> 00:07:05,094
in store, sometimes they go in store,
and look at the products, try it

93
00:07:05,094 --> 00:07:07,984
out, but they don't want to carry it
in the store and they order online.

94
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:13,584
So over the years, the retail
landscape has become extremely

95
00:07:13,614 --> 00:07:20,344
complex and forecasting is a
critical component to identify these

96
00:07:20,354 --> 00:07:22,964
signals in consumer preferences.

97
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:28,429
Right and also there is a say
various components when it comes to

98
00:07:28,429 --> 00:07:32,239
forecasting Let's look at some of the
challenges i'm going to touch upon.

99
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:38,359
the extremely critical ones with
respect to forecasting like one

100
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:40,089
of the things is horizon, right?

101
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:44,949
Like even if you are forecasting, let's
say something like a demand from consumer

102
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:52,299
it looks simple it looks like it's
the same thing but forecasting demand

103
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:58,159
Is Different when you are looking at
different horizons like greater than 24

104
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:03,019
months from now We are making decisions
on product design contracts strategy

105
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,399
planning and other things, right?

106
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,909
But let's say if you are looking
at something like between three to

107
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:15,779
24 months We are looking at Okay,
assortment planning, space optimization,

108
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:17,559
sales and operations planning.

109
00:08:17,989 --> 00:08:21,269
But when you get into a three to
12 week period, we are looking at

110
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:22,709
a completely different use cases.

111
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:26,709
Workforce optimization, capacity
management, inventory allocation,

112
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:29,929
distribution center replenishments,
and other aspects, right?

113
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:35,729
And one to three weeks, we are extremely
operational, like inventory allocation,

114
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,639
clear outs, discounts, and other things.

115
00:08:39,134 --> 00:08:45,694
So that's horizon is a very important,
concept, because that adds a lot of

116
00:08:45,714 --> 00:08:51,234
complexity, like how, for instance, can
you predict something five years from now?

117
00:08:51,284 --> 00:08:52,094
It's extremely hard.

118
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,224
Nobody predicted COVID.

119
00:08:53,254 --> 00:08:54,684
Nobody predicted a pandemic.

120
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:58,364
but at least it's good to
know there are always errors.

121
00:08:58,594 --> 00:08:59,764
Nobody can predict the future.

122
00:08:59,794 --> 00:09:04,164
But like you having forecasting
systems give a direction, a

123
00:09:04,164 --> 00:09:05,364
corporation has to move forward.

124
00:09:05,694 --> 00:09:10,844
In order to gain customers in
order to increase revenue, right?

125
00:09:10,844 --> 00:09:15,924
There are other challenges like for
instance, granularity with respect

126
00:09:15,924 --> 00:09:20,184
to forecasting You could forecast
at different granular scales.

127
00:09:20,224 --> 00:09:25,404
You can look at a individual product
and say It's the demand of this

128
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:30,724
product is going to be five units or
something like that versus You can

129
00:09:30,724 --> 00:09:35,384
look at it at a store or like a region
or a channel level as well, right?

130
00:09:35,994 --> 00:09:41,679
So Generally, predicting at a
high granular scales are extremely

131
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,679
easier compared to forecasting
at a lower granular level, just

132
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,549
because of the volatility, right?

133
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:53,859
and then we have, as we discussed,
short term versus long term

134
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:58,789
forecasting, and then, the other
biggest challenge is data fragmentation.

135
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:01,579
the data is, collected.

136
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:03,869
if you have an e commerce
website, it's easier.

137
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:09,219
to capture data like, okay, everything
is online and the data capture systems

138
00:10:09,219 --> 00:10:10,739
go into different systems online.

139
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:14,469
But let's say when there is IOT
devices, like you have your payment

140
00:10:14,469 --> 00:10:19,149
devices on this, stores and, there
are tracking devices on the store.

141
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:23,999
In that case, it gets complex,
with respect to the data and

142
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,259
that will add a lot of noise.

143
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:28,789
Sometimes then the data
goes missing and so on.

144
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:34,049
And of course the demand volatility
consumers change their preferences

145
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:39,979
and we need to handle the fluctuations
in customer behavior Another thing

146
00:10:39,979 --> 00:10:43,559
is one of the biggest challenge
was like the covert 19, right?

147
00:10:43,619 --> 00:10:48,679
There has been a drastic shift in
consumer behaviors due to lockdown and

148
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:53,379
economic uncertainty And that's when there
was a lot of supply chain disruptions

149
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,419
that affected inventory management.

150
00:10:55,979 --> 00:10:59,299
this has been, eye opening
moments for the retailers.

151
00:10:59,349 --> 00:11:05,619
And this has, created, understanding
in the importance of real time

152
00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:09,169
forecasting and adaptability
in the supply chain systems.

153
00:11:09,489 --> 00:11:13,579
So now there is an accelerated
adoption for AI ML models to

154
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:15,439
handle this unpredictability.

155
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:19,459
So now let's look into,
prompt engineering.

156
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:24,699
and then I'll first introduce what
prompt engineering is and how it's.

157
00:11:25,214 --> 00:11:30,374
different, and how it's going to
help forecasting and how we can use

158
00:11:30,404 --> 00:11:37,354
prompt engineering to build and help,
developing these AI forecasting systems.

159
00:11:37,854 --> 00:11:42,334
Let's start with an understanding of
what prompt engineering is and why

160
00:11:42,344 --> 00:11:44,904
it's so vital in retail forecasting.

161
00:11:45,444 --> 00:11:51,024
so prompt engineering is the process
of guiding generative AI models.

162
00:11:51,524 --> 00:11:55,234
to produce high quality targeted outputs.

163
00:11:56,129 --> 00:12:01,389
This involves carefully choosing the
right format, phrases, and structures that

164
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:05,019
shape the AI system's response, right?

165
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:08,839
So when we talk about prompt engineering,
we know that there has been a lot of

166
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,929
generative AI applications like ChatGPT,
Cloud, Anthropic, and every, every,

167
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:18,199
and every tech company is building
their own LLM models and, generative

168
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:20,909
AI solutions and so on, right?

169
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:25,359
And this has boosted the productivity
of developers, data scientists,

170
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:27,659
data analysts, and so on, right?

171
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:32,689
prompt engineering allows us to build
a library of prompts that can be reused

172
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:35,009
across different forecasting scenarios.

173
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:41,129
And this scalability is extremely
important because it enables us to

174
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:48,309
tailor AI models to various retail
forecasting needs efficiently without

175
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,631
starting from scratch every time, right?

176
00:12:51,631 --> 00:12:59,224
So, yeah, so that, that has improved a
lot of, saved a lot of developer hours and

177
00:12:59,224 --> 00:13:05,714
like I personally have used it to create
a few systems and we will get into some

178
00:13:05,714 --> 00:13:11,704
of the key techniques and how we can use
those, to quickly develop these systems.

179
00:13:12,034 --> 00:13:16,124
So there are three key techniques,
in Prompt Engineering, right?

180
00:13:17,114 --> 00:13:19,224
One is the chain of thought prompting.

181
00:13:19,484 --> 00:13:24,974
this technique is particularly useful
for breaking down complex forecasting

182
00:13:24,974 --> 00:13:28,034
questions into series of logical steps.

183
00:13:28,594 --> 00:13:30,744
For example, if you want to forecast.

184
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:36,149
seasonal sales trends, the model can
first analyze historical data patterns,

185
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,689
then consider external factors like
holidays, and finally produce a forecast.

186
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:48,309
By prompting the AI to tackle each
component sequentially, we get a well

187
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:51,189
reasoned and comprehensive forecast.

188
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:54,589
The next one is tree of thought prompting.

189
00:13:54,989 --> 00:13:58,969
With this technique, the model
explores multiple solutions.

190
00:13:59,594 --> 00:14:05,464
Or ideas before reaching a final
conclusion in retail forecasting context

191
00:14:05,464 --> 00:14:09,784
This could mean evaluating several
forecasting methods such as arima

192
00:14:09,894 --> 00:14:14,424
seasonal lives arima and different
machine learning models and then

193
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:21,674
comparing their suitability based on the
Retail requirements volatility demand

194
00:14:21,684 --> 00:14:25,914
fluctuations Seasonality and so on right?

195
00:14:26,244 --> 00:14:31,954
So this approach, allows the AI to
consider different paths and select

196
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,804
the most optimal forecasting approach.

197
00:14:35,304 --> 00:14:37,554
The third one is self refined prompting.

198
00:14:37,824 --> 00:14:43,134
This method encourages the AI to refine
its answers through an iterative process.

199
00:14:43,564 --> 00:14:47,854
For instance, after generating the
initial forecast, the AI can critique

200
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:53,084
the results, identify where it may
have underestimated the demand spikes,

201
00:14:53,354 --> 00:14:55,464
and adjust the models accordingly.

202
00:14:56,354 --> 00:15:00,264
This iterative refinement ensures
that the forecast improves with

203
00:15:00,324 --> 00:15:04,324
each pass and leading to more
accurate predictions over time.

204
00:15:05,074 --> 00:15:08,204
Each of these techniques brings
unique strengths to forecasting

205
00:15:08,204 --> 00:15:14,434
and retail, helping us harness
generative AI to produce reliable data

206
00:15:14,454 --> 00:15:20,234
driven insights tailored to complex
and dynamic retail environments.

207
00:15:20,734 --> 00:15:25,314
Next, we will look at each of these
examples and I will give you like one

208
00:15:25,314 --> 00:15:31,384
or two examples on each of these on how
you can use in your forecasting task.

209
00:15:31,884 --> 00:15:34,644
The first one is chain
of thought prompting.

210
00:15:35,594 --> 00:15:40,714
so as we mentioned, the purpose is to
break down the forecasting task into

211
00:15:41,134 --> 00:15:43,694
logical and step by step components.

212
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:46,994
So this is an example
prompt that I've generated.

213
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:53,904
so for instance, develop a retail
sales forecasting model by breaking

214
00:15:53,904 --> 00:15:56,814
down the process into key steps.

215
00:15:57,434 --> 00:16:01,144
Start by preparing the data, then
explore and evaluate different

216
00:16:01,154 --> 00:16:05,354
forecasting models and conclude with
an evaluation on the test dataset.

217
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:09,144
Outline each step and
include key consideration.

218
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:16,419
In here, I'm telling the model
each, individual step that, that

219
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:22,599
the generative model has to perform
and then, outline the each step

220
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,539
and then include key consideration.

221
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:29,369
Depending on your AI model, you can expect
different results, but this is a sample

222
00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:31,929
result that AI could come up with, right?

223
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:35,439
So first, it'll start with data
preparation, as I mentioned.

224
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:39,789
It could convert dates into daytime
formats, such as index, check for missing

225
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:44,859
values, and fill them using interpolation,
aggregating the data, and so on.

226
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:50,459
Then it'll start doing the exploration of
model tuning, and then model evaluation.

227
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:57,029
So, I'm not saying the models are perfect
or anything, but currently the generative

228
00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:04,509
AI models can do a lot of, task by itself
by generating codes and it will save a

229
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:08,729
lot of time, for instance, converting
day to day time format or, Checking

230
00:17:08,729 --> 00:17:10,659
for missing values and so on, right?

231
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,619
you get the scripts.

232
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:16,169
You get the inputs from
these models quickly.

233
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:19,239
sometimes you may also miss
out on certain things, right?

234
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:25,089
the benefit is, with this chain of
thought prompting is it guides the AI

235
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:31,339
system to systematically approach each
component of the task ensuring that all

236
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:33,519
the critical tasks are covered logically.

237
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,979
Then we have the three of the prompting.

238
00:17:37,699 --> 00:17:42,609
This is one of my favorite approaches
because it explores multiple approaches

239
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:47,389
to solving the forecasting problem
before selecting a final model, right?

240
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:52,099
one of the example here is consider three
different approaches for forecasting

241
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:55,829
retail sales, a traditional one, a
machine learning one, and a hybrid one.

242
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:00,779
And then for each approach
provide baselink outline of steps

243
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:04,939
advantages limitations finally
recommend the most suitable one.

244
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,499
So the model could, first start with
the traditional, and then we have

245
00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:12,479
the machine learning models, such
as XGBoost, random forest, and then

246
00:18:12,989 --> 00:18:17,399
a hybrid one, which is to combine
the ARIMA with XGBoost here, right?

247
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:22,699
and then it would also suggest, okay,
for large seasonal data, the hybrid model

248
00:18:22,729 --> 00:18:24,789
may offer the best performance and so on.

249
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,659
So it actually gives.

250
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:33,049
a lot for even just this one is more
about what you can do okay These are

251
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:36,659
the steps that you could take gives a
structured approach in project management

252
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:41,099
itself you can also next go ahead and
ask the next level question right is

253
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:46,539
to generate codes for these and then so
that you can keep adding to your thought

254
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:51,599
process the next one is self refined
prompting, the purpose of This is to

255
00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:57,329
guide the AI systems to iteratively
refine the forecasting model by critiquing

256
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,349
its performance and making adjustments.

257
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:06,519
An example is create a retail sales
forecasting model using Sarima

258
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:10,369
model and then critique the model
based on its test performance.

259
00:19:10,489 --> 00:19:15,619
Identify issues such as under estimating
seasonal peaks, refining the model to

260
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:20,489
improve accuracy, and finally evaluate the
refined model and report the improvements.

261
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:25,539
So the AI system can go build an initial
model such as Sarima to capture the

262
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:30,149
seasonality, and then it could evaluate
the model on the test data with metrics

263
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:33,329
such as MAPE, and then it can critique.

264
00:19:33,949 --> 00:19:37,589
It can say Sarima model captures
seasonality, but underestimates

265
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,579
peaks during holiday season,
leading to higher errors.

266
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:45,419
The refinement could be adjusting the
seasonal parameters to account for

267
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:49,299
sharper peaks and introduce exogenous
variable to improve peak forecast.

268
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,389
And final evaluation.

269
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:56,729
So this approach allows the AI to assess
and refine its forecast iteratively

270
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:01,179
leading to more accurate tailored
model of for retail forecast, right?

271
00:20:01,189 --> 00:20:05,279
So this is the approach that as
data scientists, we use, in our

272
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:06,619
day to day lives as well, right?

273
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:11,179
We start with a baseline model and
then, we iterate again, conduct

274
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:17,389
experiments, evaluate to finally come
up with our, final solution, right?

275
00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:24,079
So we are prompting the AI systems to
do the same, to select the best model.

276
00:20:24,579 --> 00:20:28,559
What are the applications of prompt
engineering and forecasting and

277
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,059
how can we actually use them?

278
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:36,509
It's a very unique question because
people still think about prompt

279
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:42,639
engineering as something that helps
with NLP tasks and they see it as

280
00:20:42,689 --> 00:20:47,119
used in chatbots and like different
websites or product recommendation

281
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,149
or in generative AI application.

282
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:54,469
How can we use this in a traditional
field such as forecasting, right?

283
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:59,789
There are so many, people are getting
creative with so many, new applications,

284
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:07,359
but there are a few areas where we can use
greatly enhance the forecasting process.

285
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,989
The first one is proof
of concept development.

286
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:13,969
When building a new forecasting
model, prompt engineering can help

287
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:15,869
quickly generate a proof of concept.

288
00:21:16,424 --> 00:21:22,234
This allows to test ideas, validate
model feasibility, and demonstrate

289
00:21:22,234 --> 00:21:25,844
initial forecasting capabilities
before this full implementation.

290
00:21:26,344 --> 00:21:32,164
Next is generating scripts, writing
scripts to pre process data or evaluate

291
00:21:32,194 --> 00:21:34,404
models can be extremely time consuming.

292
00:21:34,874 --> 00:21:39,944
But with prompt engineering, we can
guide AI to generate clean, efficient

293
00:21:39,974 --> 00:21:44,264
codes for tasks such as data cleaning,
feature engineering, and model evaluation.

294
00:21:44,844 --> 00:21:48,414
This accelerates development
and reduces manual effort.

295
00:21:48,914 --> 00:21:51,964
One of my favorites is
exploratory data analysis.

296
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:56,514
For forecasting, understanding
the data patterns is critical.

297
00:21:57,014 --> 00:22:01,784
and prompting the AI to perform
EDA helps visualize trends,

298
00:22:01,794 --> 00:22:04,304
seasonality, anomalies, and etc.

299
00:22:04,774 --> 00:22:07,444
The visualization scripts
are particularly complex.

300
00:22:07,454 --> 00:22:11,154
It's not complex with respect to
the conceptual understanding, but

301
00:22:11,154 --> 00:22:16,384
it can get cumbersome with respect
to the, different libraries and

302
00:22:16,384 --> 00:22:19,494
different, data types and so on.

303
00:22:19,494 --> 00:22:24,449
but AI is good at just extracting
the, logical data, right?

304
00:22:24,449 --> 00:22:25,939
So it saves a lot of time.

305
00:22:25,939 --> 00:22:29,969
It has personally saved me a lot
of time, in developing scripts and

306
00:22:29,969 --> 00:22:32,349
visualizations to identify patterns.

307
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:35,069
Then we can, use AI to debug.

308
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,399
I saw a stat that, okay,
the stack overflows.

309
00:22:39,449 --> 00:22:43,429
Traffic has been going down a
lot since chatgpd was introduced.

310
00:22:43,489 --> 00:22:44,849
And there's a reason for that.

311
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:52,889
you can easily ask, these systems to
debug your script and with the right

312
00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:55,829
prompt engineering, it gets better, right?

313
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:00,049
Like it can show you things that you
have missed out personally, and it also

314
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:06,119
increases The data science productivity
and one of the other interesting and

315
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:11,289
the new area is to get signals from
textual data Detail forecasting can

316
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:16,669
benefit from external textual data like
news headlines social media sentiment

317
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:21,639
and so on And with the right proms we
can extract key signals from textual

318
00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:26,544
data Text such as sentiment trends that
correlates with sales performance and

319
00:23:26,544 --> 00:23:32,814
this data can be Incorporated into our
forecast to capture the impact of market

320
00:23:32,814 --> 00:23:36,144
sentiment or economic events on retail

321
00:23:36,644 --> 00:23:41,664
And each of these areas demonstrate how
prompt engineering supports the efficient

322
00:23:41,674 --> 00:23:48,094
development of robust forecasting
models, making the AI driven forecasting

323
00:23:48,134 --> 00:23:53,544
process more scalable, insightful,
and responsive to complex data.

324
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:54,959
Retail needs.

325
00:23:55,459 --> 00:24:02,189
Next, I'm gonna show some use cases
on, how to use some prompts, right?

326
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:05,219
So this one is around proof
of concept development.

327
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:08,829
Like how do you develop a comprehensive
time series forecasting model?

328
00:24:09,509 --> 00:24:14,847
one prompt that we could use is
develop a Python script to create

329
00:24:14,847 --> 00:24:18,409
comprehensive proof of concept
time series model using Sarima.

330
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:24,459
Now we are outlining each and every step
that the AI model should use, right?

331
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:29,439
Begin with data processing steps, include
time based indexing, handle missing

332
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:31,389
values, and outline applied detection.

333
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:36,699
Then we are talking about how to use
certain parameters, such as seasonality,

334
00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:41,959
and how do you minimize it and what
sort of technique you need to use, like

335
00:24:41,969 --> 00:24:44,589
use good search or AIC minimization.

336
00:24:44,869 --> 00:24:48,869
Then we are talking about the backtesting
strategies, split the data training,

337
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:55,794
and use Error metrics such as MSE and
MAPE and provide visualizations for

338
00:24:56,134 --> 00:25:00,894
both actual versus forecasted values
and also include residual diagnostics.

339
00:25:01,714 --> 00:25:06,144
Now conclude with a summary report
assessing model assumptions, limitations

340
00:25:06,144 --> 00:25:07,854
and suggest potential next steps.

341
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:13,229
Use pandas, stats models, and matplotlib
to implement this Robust object.

342
00:25:13,329 --> 00:25:17,229
So there is a lot of information
that's given to the AI model

343
00:25:17,729 --> 00:25:19,619
So that it doesn't hallucinate.

344
00:25:19,629 --> 00:25:21,689
It doesn't Stay away from it.

345
00:25:21,709 --> 00:25:26,654
We have very specifics to work on
but it is still your job to provide

346
00:25:26,684 --> 00:25:33,004
these specific instructions so that
AI models can easily generate them.

347
00:25:33,504 --> 00:25:36,864
The other thing is around
script generation, right?

348
00:25:36,884 --> 00:25:43,124
So this is a prompt for sophisticated data
transformation and aggregation script.

349
00:25:43,744 --> 00:25:46,814
So the prompt is around generate
a Python code that performs.

350
00:25:46,835 --> 00:25:52,694
Advanced data transformation for time
series analysis on a data set sales

351
00:25:52,694 --> 00:25:57,834
data containing date product category
and transaction value This code should

352
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:01,084
so we are already giving data specific.

353
00:26:01,084 --> 00:26:07,234
So I made up these, features and data
set but we are giving some very specific

354
00:26:07,294 --> 00:26:13,274
column names which matches with the data
that I have so that it's easy for me to

355
00:26:13,274 --> 00:26:18,734
just You copy paste and then get started
right and then i'm talking about again

356
00:26:18,754 --> 00:26:25,404
the specific convert date to time based
index handle Any missing or inconsistent

357
00:26:25,414 --> 00:26:31,044
time stamps are just for time zone
differences if necessary And, then we

358
00:26:31,044 --> 00:26:35,834
are talking about aggregation and then
calculating features, specific features

359
00:26:35,854 --> 00:26:40,824
like month over month growth rate, moving
averages, seasonal indicators, and so on.

360
00:26:40,854 --> 00:26:48,094
And then we are telling the AI system
to output a structured format with, and

361
00:26:48,104 --> 00:26:52,534
then also mentioning implement this using
pandas and ensuring high flexibility

362
00:26:52,534 --> 00:26:57,234
for different time zones and potential
categorical feature explosion, right?

363
00:26:57,294 --> 00:27:03,814
It's a very well written prompt on where
AI has access to certain things, but limit

364
00:27:03,864 --> 00:27:08,444
your hallucinations and other things so
that we get the very specific output.

365
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:15,524
And, This is a, exploratory data
analysis, prompt to get a in depth

366
00:27:15,554 --> 00:27:20,204
visualization of trends, seasonalities,
anomalies, so it's around design a

367
00:27:20,204 --> 00:27:25,604
Python code that performs exploratory
data analysis on a time series data set,

368
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:27,494
sales tiers with column date and sales.

369
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:33,354
And we are telling what exactly, the
script should do, generate an interactive

370
00:27:33,474 --> 00:27:40,224
line plot, decomposition, and annotate
anomalies using C score method, and

371
00:27:40,224 --> 00:27:44,874
summarize insights from EDA in the report
section, highlighting seasonal patterns,

372
00:27:44,884 --> 00:27:46,894
cyclic trends, and any anomalies.

373
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:50,879
And we are again mentioning use
libraries such as plotly for

374
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,159
interactive visualization Stats
models for decomposition and scipy

375
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:57,199
for anomaly detection, right?

376
00:27:57,479 --> 00:28:04,339
So by one by limiting the ai system to
Certain libraries which you are familiar

377
00:28:04,339 --> 00:28:09,199
with it's easy to take this work as an
initial starting point and then work

378
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,919
build upon it so This is the last example.

379
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:17,694
It's one of the most upcoming
trends right is to capture

380
00:28:17,694 --> 00:28:19,884
the signals from textual data.

381
00:28:20,484 --> 00:28:23,024
This is another favorite of mine.

382
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:27,464
I would call it the advanced signal
extraction from text for time series

383
00:28:27,494 --> 00:28:34,394
modeling So the prompt is around generate
a python script to extract meaningful

384
00:28:34,554 --> 00:28:40,244
signals from Dataset news headlines
containing date and headline and integrate

385
00:28:40,254 --> 00:28:45,634
them into time series stock prices
dataset with date and closing price This

386
00:28:45,634 --> 00:28:50,464
is not exactly a, retail forecasting
sense, but it's still on the time series.

387
00:28:50,884 --> 00:28:55,974
A retail forecasting use case would
look like something like getting a

388
00:28:55,974 --> 00:29:01,084
social media trends and like seeing
any index or create an index saying

389
00:29:01,094 --> 00:29:02,624
the customer sentiment, right?

390
00:29:03,044 --> 00:29:08,444
So in here, we have, a few steps, right?

391
00:29:08,444 --> 00:29:13,434
See pre processed text data with advanced
NLP models, and then specific steps.

392
00:29:13,444 --> 00:29:17,594
Steps like tokenization, removal
of stop words, lemmatization, and

393
00:29:17,594 --> 00:29:22,274
extracting sentiment scores using
fine tuned models for finance

394
00:29:22,274 --> 00:29:24,024
or industry specific sentiment.

395
00:29:24,524 --> 00:29:29,334
Then we are talking about how to aggregate
sentiment scores and keyword frequency

396
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,944
metric that reflect public sentiment.

397
00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:35,839
sentiment and event frequency and
merge these with stock prices.

398
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:39,809
Then we are talking about causality to
predict relationship between sentiment

399
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,779
signals and stock prices movements.

400
00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:46,139
And finally, generating a visual
correlation matrix and time series

401
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:50,229
plot overlaying sentiment score
and stock price to illustrate

402
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:51,999
alignment and divergent strengths.

403
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:56,169
Implement spaCy or transformers
for text processing, pandas

404
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:59,219
for merging and transformation,
and matplotlib or seaborn for

405
00:29:59,219 --> 00:30:01,599
visualization and correlation analysis.

406
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:06,309
So these are some of the things
that like add a lot of value, right?

407
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:12,369
See like You can quickly generate scripts,
you can quickly ask these AI systems to

408
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:17,799
get friends with large amount of text
data and integrate it with stock prices,

409
00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:21,569
at least you could see whether you're
seeing any signal or not, without even

410
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:25,069
wasting any development time, right?

411
00:30:25,629 --> 00:30:30,399
having said that, the AI systems have
a lot of benefits, as we saw, feel

412
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:36,679
free to use any of these ROMs in your
forecasting tasks, but, there are a few

413
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:44,019
things that we need to be aware of when
we practically implement, these prompts.

414
00:30:44,424 --> 00:30:50,634
So the quality and the accuracy of the
forecasting outputs heavily dependent is

415
00:30:50,714 --> 00:30:55,774
heavily dependent on the clarity of the
prompt vague or incomplete prompts can

416
00:30:55,774 --> 00:31:02,394
result in Models that overlook factors
like seasonality trends specific time

417
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:07,224
intervals leading to unreliable forecasts
So when you looked at the some of the

418
00:31:07,224 --> 00:31:12,289
prompts that are shown i'm not giving
any open ended Concluded Prompts, right?

419
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:13,299
It's all closed end.

420
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:18,199
I'm even with respect to the library
scripts on how much an AI system can go

421
00:31:18,949 --> 00:31:25,309
So that's very important because it can
actually, if you don't give the right

422
00:31:25,309 --> 00:31:29,239
prompt, you can actually interpret scripts
that would take you a long time, or

423
00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:33,789
even the AI systems can tell you things
which is not actually true, which may be

424
00:31:33,789 --> 00:31:36,279
hard to debug at a later point in time.

425
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:41,529
And then many advanced forecasting
models generated by prompt engineered

426
00:31:41,529 --> 00:31:47,299
scripts, especially like deep learning
approaches, can be difficult to interpret.

427
00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:54,709
Because, because they, have the liberty
and also, it's very hard for us to,

428
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:58,519
look at a deep learning model since it's
like a black box type of model, right?

429
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:02,149
Even though we have weights, it's very
hard to go through all the nonlinearities

430
00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:04,189
within, different models, right?

431
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:06,199
So it'll be hard to debug, right?

432
00:32:06,249 --> 00:32:11,289
You need to be careful when you are doing
such, modeling tasks, and then prompt

433
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:15,749
engineering models may struggle to account
for unexpected external shocks like

434
00:32:15,749 --> 00:32:23,179
economic crisis, pandemics, because the
AI models itself is based on limited data.

435
00:32:23,229 --> 00:32:24,849
So you need to have an understanding of.

436
00:32:25,424 --> 00:32:29,674
till when the data is trained and
what's the limitations and, what

437
00:32:29,944 --> 00:32:32,364
these models can't do, right?

438
00:32:32,904 --> 00:32:36,974
And also the reliance on high
quality data and pre processing.

439
00:32:37,474 --> 00:32:42,504
Accurate forecasts require
clean and well processed data.

440
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:47,524
The AI models generated from PROMs
may not automatically address issues

441
00:32:47,844 --> 00:32:51,574
like missing values, irregular
intervals, outliers, and less.

442
00:32:52,274 --> 00:32:55,154
You are explicitly
prompting these systems.

443
00:32:55,694 --> 00:32:57,954
So you need to be extremely careful.

444
00:32:58,424 --> 00:33:01,414
it's not just forecasting, but with
respect to forecast, you need to be

445
00:33:01,414 --> 00:33:06,454
extremely careful so that it doesn't
increase the risk of inaccurate forecast.

446
00:33:06,904 --> 00:33:11,704
If data issues goes undetected, right?

447
00:33:12,244 --> 00:33:18,894
So, my recommendation would be even now
with my practical experience, these AI

448
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:23,474
models are extremely good at, doing the
initial analysis and initial analysis

449
00:33:23,564 --> 00:33:27,994
can be, easy to debug, even if there
is a mistake, like visualizing data.

450
00:33:28,054 --> 00:33:34,559
You can, spend writing prompts to generate
Tons of visualization to understand your

451
00:33:34,569 --> 00:33:39,689
data really well, which you can then
take and then develop models, right?

452
00:33:39,699 --> 00:33:44,049
Like visualization scripts usually
takes a lot of time, but these

453
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:51,549
systems can reduce the effort required
to build these visualizations,

454
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:52,989
exploratory reports, and analysis.

455
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:58,009
Next, I want to touch base on,
on the future of AI in retail

456
00:33:58,029 --> 00:34:00,579
forecasting, the trends, right?

457
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:03,609
As we look into the future,
there are several emerging

458
00:34:03,629 --> 00:34:05,829
trends in retail forecasting.

459
00:34:06,489 --> 00:34:11,439
that's, one of the key things is,
what I see is incorporating the need

460
00:34:11,439 --> 00:34:16,929
for incorporating social media and
external data for demand sensing with

461
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:21,219
the vast amount of data generated on
social media and external platforms.

462
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:26,159
Retailers can capture these
real time insights on customer

463
00:34:26,169 --> 00:34:27,629
segment and market trends.

464
00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:31,349
I'm not saying that it's not
being done at this point, but

465
00:34:31,709 --> 00:34:33,409
there's a lot that can be done.

466
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:38,219
By incorporating this data into
forecasting models, we can improve demand

467
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:43,669
sensing, especially around events, product
launches, and seasonal shifts, right?

468
00:34:44,189 --> 00:34:46,379
The next thing is around AI agents.

469
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:54,069
so 2024 has been, here where agents,
AI agents have been on the rise and AI

470
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,779
driven supply chain agents are enabling
faster and more agile forecasting solution

471
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:02,109
for inventory and logistics management.

472
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:06,469
For instance, these AI agents
can generate rapid forecasts.

473
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:12,459
Adjust inventory levels, even recommend
reordering strategies in order to

474
00:35:12,889 --> 00:35:16,809
response to demand fluctuation,
optimizing the entire supply chain.

475
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:20,489
And then we see a lot of trend
around predictive analytics

476
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:23,549
for customer personalization
and marketing optimization.

477
00:35:24,029 --> 00:35:30,519
so we, there is, this has been a field
that's been existing, but like we see the

478
00:35:30,549 --> 00:35:40,059
integration of AI systems to, Makes sense
of a lot of customer, reviews, customer,

479
00:35:40,529 --> 00:35:45,949
support, and it can make sense of, let's
say, Take feedback and quickly analyze

480
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:47,829
it and turn it into some action, right?

481
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,979
Like for instance, let's say
you have a food ordering app And

482
00:35:51,979 --> 00:35:55,309
then there is some issue that
happened while delivering the food.

483
00:35:55,659 --> 00:36:01,959
You can always Insert these type in
you don't need to wait for a customer

484
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:04,779
support agent to, to be available.

485
00:36:04,779 --> 00:36:09,999
You can have an AI agent or a LLM
system to clear the query for you

486
00:36:09,999 --> 00:36:13,629
by understanding the sentiment,
by understanding the actual issue,

487
00:36:13,659 --> 00:36:16,229
and then taking action, right?

488
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:22,429
It can also then give the customers,
some promotions or some incentive

489
00:36:22,489 --> 00:36:25,819
to stick around and to increase
the customer satisfaction.

490
00:36:26,529 --> 00:36:29,529
having said all of these, there
are some ethical concerns as well.

491
00:36:29,529 --> 00:36:33,419
There's a big, new field that's
prompting up with all these AI systems.

492
00:36:33,419 --> 00:36:37,879
How much should we be concerned with
respect to these systems and giving

493
00:36:38,169 --> 00:36:43,034
autonomy on these systems to give
the decision making power that humans

494
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,634
have been doing, such a new area.

495
00:36:45,684 --> 00:36:48,964
it's an area, but it's getting
more and more popularity with

496
00:36:48,964 --> 00:36:51,434
respect to, privacy regulations.

497
00:36:51,934 --> 00:36:55,074
And then the other trend is
around, fully automated demand

498
00:36:55,074 --> 00:36:57,354
forecasting systems driven by AI.

499
00:36:57,774 --> 00:37:03,864
fully automation is still a far step, but
I see it happening sometime in the future,

500
00:37:03,884 --> 00:37:09,284
at least in the non critical areas, or
it could, it can include, or we can have

501
00:37:09,284 --> 00:37:14,514
systems with uncertainty measures like
probabilistic forecasting, so that even

502
00:37:14,514 --> 00:37:18,674
if we have a forecast, we know how to read
the forecast and make it interpretable

503
00:37:19,194 --> 00:37:24,414
for, let's say, the businesses do not
rely on a tech team or a data science

504
00:37:24,414 --> 00:37:29,944
team to provide them with the forecast
or develop a forecasting system, right?

505
00:37:29,944 --> 00:37:36,764
So it's enabling businesses to generate
technical solutions for their need and

506
00:37:36,764 --> 00:37:40,544
quickly act upon, the business decisions.

507
00:37:41,044 --> 00:37:42,954
that's it, for the talk today.

508
00:37:42,954 --> 00:37:47,484
I hope you enjoyed the talk and
I hope you can use these prompt

509
00:37:47,484 --> 00:37:51,284
engineering techniques and use
these understanding in quickly

510
00:37:51,304 --> 00:37:54,494
developing your forecasting solutions.

511
00:37:54,914 --> 00:38:02,294
