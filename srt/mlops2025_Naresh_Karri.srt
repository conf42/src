1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,310
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,070
Thank you for being here.

3
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:02,970
My name is Nja.

4
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,480
Today I'll be sharing insights on how
we can successfully scale AI systems in

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,120
the financial industry, specifically,
how to handle high volume transactions.

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,230
While processing and while staying
compliant with strict regulations,

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,170
the talk will cover on operational
strategies, infrastructure

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,360
choices, and real world lessons.

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,620
We have learned from deploying
ML pipelines across the financial

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,450
services transactional ecosystem.

11
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,190
What is the challenges that we are looking
at when we look at financial institutions?

12
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,710
The challenges are unlike in
any other industry, right?

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,570
Fundamentally.

14
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:39,165
We are processing billions and billions
of transactions with less than a

15
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:41,624
millisecond of a second response times.

16
00:00:41,964 --> 00:00:45,085
On top of that, every decision
must satisfy the regulations like

17
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:51,835
G-D-P-R-C-C-P-A of CRA, and then
you have to also maintain 99.99%

18
00:00:51,835 --> 00:00:52,870
of time for critical systems.

19
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,635
While achieving the uptime latency is
another aspect of it as well, right?

20
00:00:58,705 --> 00:01:04,315
You need to provide responses within a
fraction of a second while also making

21
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:07,975
sure that the right decisions are made
at the right time, the right level of

22
00:01:07,975 --> 00:01:09,835
compliance checks and balances happen.

23
00:01:10,315 --> 00:01:12,205
I'll give you an example, right?

24
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,995
When you're doing a credit card
authorization transaction, the

25
00:01:14,995 --> 00:01:19,045
authorization has to happen in less than
like a fraction of a second because the

26
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,695
customer is still there in the session.

27
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:23,564
While the customer is still there
in the session, you are engaging

28
00:01:23,564 --> 00:01:25,064
with the customer behind the scenes.

29
00:01:25,064 --> 00:01:28,485
You need to make sure that KYC
is done, the KYB is done, the

30
00:01:28,485 --> 00:01:29,804
sanction screening check is done.

31
00:01:30,045 --> 00:01:34,904
So all these things have to
happen simultaneously in parallel.

32
00:01:35,355 --> 00:01:39,015
And then final decision has
to be taken while ensuring the

33
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:40,665
business outcomes are met, right?

34
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:41,624
Because every.

35
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:46,425
Every drop that happens when the
checkout conversion doesn't happen,

36
00:01:46,425 --> 00:01:47,625
that means it's a lost sale.

37
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,695
A lost sale means it's a lost in revenue.

38
00:01:50,055 --> 00:01:53,715
So these are the factors that
needs to be considered when we

39
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:58,725
are looking at deploying machine
learning systems in financial space.

40
00:01:59,725 --> 00:02:03,325
What are the three three
critical financial applications?

41
00:02:03,325 --> 00:02:04,765
There are three core areas.

42
00:02:04,765 --> 00:02:08,605
One is, as I alluded in the previous
example, it is real time fraud detection.

43
00:02:09,084 --> 00:02:14,445
Then the credit assessment, then automated
financial management of it, the first,

44
00:02:14,445 --> 00:02:15,945
again, I'll quickly touch base on this.

45
00:02:15,945 --> 00:02:19,125
The first is real time fraud detection
models that can scan millions

46
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:22,965
of daily transactions to spot
suspicious activity milliseconds.

47
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:26,204
The credit assessments where
platforms needs to value the

48
00:02:26,204 --> 00:02:30,285
credit worthiness while remaining
compliant and explainable, right?

49
00:02:30,335 --> 00:02:34,145
Imagine a scenario where you are
applying for a personal loan or

50
00:02:34,145 --> 00:02:35,525
you're applying for a credit card.

51
00:02:35,915 --> 00:02:38,735
You would have seen this from
your real world examples, like

52
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:40,295
what the decision is in life.

53
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:46,440
Few seconds, but behind the scenes, the
whole aspect of assessment, prospecting,

54
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,980
underwriting, all these things need
to happen in a pretty quick time.

55
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,950
And lastly, it is the
financial management.

56
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,240
Everything from portfolio optimization
to old algorithmic trading to

57
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,980
personalize financial guidance.

58
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,390
These are mission critical so that
they rely on the strong ML operations

59
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,060
foundations and the associated pipelines.

60
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:12,699
Real time fraud detection
architecture is super important.

61
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:16,799
As you can see over here on this
slide what I'm presenting over

62
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:19,529
here is various channels, right?

63
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:21,649
You have the transaction
sources from where.

64
00:03:22,444 --> 00:03:23,944
A transaction can originate.

65
00:03:23,944 --> 00:03:28,924
You have point of sale channels, you have
online channels, you have mobile channels.

66
00:03:29,474 --> 00:03:35,084
So all these channels have their own
respective streams, and those streams of

67
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:37,964
data have to be processed and published.

68
00:03:38,204 --> 00:03:42,370
And that is where the next aspect of
pipelines and feature store come into the.

69
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,590
Where we outline what are the low
latency inference systems, what

70
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,590
are the decision engines, what are
their rules that they're applying?

71
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,590
And finally monitoring
and audit systems, right?

72
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,290
Ensure telemetry,
retaining, and compliance.

73
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,590
The key point here though, fraud
detection isn't just about a model.

74
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,250
It's about a pipeline that can
handle massive scale in seconds.

75
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,460
What are the challenges in
fraud detection in MLO Ops?

76
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,560
And this is another key.

77
00:04:07,235 --> 00:04:09,065
Vector that needs to be considered.

78
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:13,555
And as you see on this slide goes
is the real time performance.

79
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:18,265
Achieving sub 10 millisecond latency
while processing over a hundred thousand

80
00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:21,445
transactions per second during peak
periods is incredibly demanding.

81
00:04:22,135 --> 00:04:23,635
Then the feature freshness, right?

82
00:04:23,635 --> 00:04:25,435
Fraud stills evolve quickly.

83
00:04:25,435 --> 00:04:29,305
The DDoS attacks that we
have seen over the last few.

84
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,460
Instances will actually peak, right?

85
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,800
And that.

86
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,680
That plays a critical role in ensuring
that our features stay in compliant

87
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,320
and with various fraud patterns.

88
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:46,190
The third is the rapid adaptation,
which is pro tactics emerge

89
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,799
constantly and our systems need
to recognize them immediately.

90
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,770
False positives, that's
the final behavior.

91
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:55,520
If we flag too many legitimate
transactions, we are losing the

92
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,340
risk of losing the customers.

93
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,140
So that's another thing that needs to
be kept in mind, and that is where the

94
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:05,539
balancing act has to be super efficient.

95
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:09,530
Otherwise, we run into the risk of
losing value of customers, which

96
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,080
in turn impact sales and revenue.

97
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:18,289
The next slide as you guys can see over
here, it speaks about what are the key

98
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:23,769
vectors in assessing a credit application
or assessing credit worthiness of an

99
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:26,064
individual using the ML ops framework.

100
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:30,939
As you can see the frameworks ensure
data orchestration that tracks the full

101
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:33,519
lineage of every data source model.

102
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,389
Governance provides version history,
approval, workflows, so we know which

103
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:42,039
model made which decision and validation
systems rigorously test for payments.

104
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:45,259
When it comes to lending, regulators
and customers need to know the

105
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:46,759
system is both accurate and fair.

106
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:47,919
That's.

107
00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:50,589
On the credit assessment
side of the world.

108
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:54,489
And of course the final aspect is the
automated financial management systems.

109
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:59,589
This is, again, super important
because if you consider in any line

110
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:05,639
of business, whether it is payments
or lending or further matter, any

111
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,869
financial transaction, at the end of the
day, everything has to be inside the.

112
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,989
It's a zero sum principle, right?

113
00:06:11,989 --> 00:06:17,159
The debits and credits have to
match, and you cannot have money

114
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:19,139
being created on the fly, right?

115
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:21,239
It cannot be created, nor
it cannot be destroyed.

116
00:06:21,609 --> 00:06:25,779
Every record has to match, and that
can be achieved through streamlined.

117
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:31,089
Model deployment pipelines, monitoring
systems, integration workflows,

118
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:35,799
automated workflows where you can
actually achieve this through various

119
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,729
streaming technologies as well.

120
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,719
As and when a transaction happens,
you publish it to a Kafka topic.

121
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:44,179
Consumer subscribed to the topic.

122
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:47,044
Then you record the transactions
in your ledger system.

123
00:06:47,044 --> 00:06:51,394
You use it for reconciliation, settlement
clearing, making sure that everything

124
00:06:51,394 --> 00:06:53,164
is reconciled behind the scenes.

125
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:56,284
So it's super important to have
automated financial management systems.

126
00:06:56,284 --> 00:07:00,004
Otherwise it becomes super
tricky to track the transactions.

127
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:01,614
And the next slide.

128
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:06,474
As you can see over here, it covers
the high level architecture for

129
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:09,234
deploying MOPS and financial services.

130
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:12,994
As you can see, the foundation
is a data infrastructure, right?

131
00:07:12,994 --> 00:07:16,654
Governance, processing, storage
for structure and unstructured data

132
00:07:16,954 --> 00:07:20,174
need to have a set of policies for
both structure and unstructured.

133
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:21,764
One set of policies for structure.

134
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:25,454
Another set of policies for unstructured
data on top of it sits the training

135
00:07:25,454 --> 00:07:30,254
and validation pipeline which automates
the compliance checks, which automates

136
00:07:30,254 --> 00:07:34,794
the testing procedures of the same
all of the various validation.

137
00:07:35,294 --> 00:07:36,074
Pipelines, right?

138
00:07:36,554 --> 00:07:40,820
And then the layer that is the
engineering and storage layer that

139
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,240
delivers both batch and real type
features, depending on where you need.

140
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,340
And then where finally we have
the model registry and deployment

141
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,650
systems for versioning, AB testing
and various rollouts, right?

142
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,610
You want to do controlled rollouts
control testing, where you actually

143
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,950
decide, oh, if I. Pull the lever of a
particular parameter in one direction.

144
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,599
How is it going to behave?

145
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,730
Or how the impact is going to be
on my core products and features.

146
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,770
Will it improve, take rate?

147
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,910
Will it improve conversion?

148
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,630
Will it improve?

149
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,900
Will it reduce the, fraud
rates or will it increase?

150
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,680
So there are, these are the various
vectors that you can control by virtue

151
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,900
of having versioning and AB testing.

152
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:23,110
And finally, at the very top is
the model serving, which is the

153
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,650
high performance APIs that powers
customer facing applications.

154
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:31,560
You need to have, as I alluded into
the, at the start in either of the use

155
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,770
cases where a customer is waiting on
the checkout screen, trying to process

156
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,450
a, or trying to purchase a product.

157
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:40,965
Or a customer waiting on the screen
where they're trying to apply for a loan.

158
00:08:41,325 --> 00:08:43,955
These are very time
sensitive customer flows.

159
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:47,335
So the high performance API layer
on the top ensures that the right

160
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:49,405
level of information is abstracted.

161
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:51,595
They buy servicing the
clients in a timely manner.

162
00:08:52,095 --> 00:08:57,675
The next slides talks about how do
we do model deployment strategies

163
00:08:57,675 --> 00:08:59,505
in a containerized manner?

164
00:08:59,895 --> 00:09:02,685
Containerization has been a game
changer in this space, right?

165
00:09:02,685 --> 00:09:06,975
The Kubernetes size separate clusters
are there for training and inference.

166
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:11,415
GPU nodes for deep learning and auto
scale based on demand compliance,

167
00:09:11,415 --> 00:09:16,845
critical models, you can in fact scale
horizontally and vertical by dedicating by

168
00:09:16,845 --> 00:09:19,425
having dedicated nodes or isolated nodes.

169
00:09:19,795 --> 00:09:24,755
Financial institutions also add
domain specific optimization,

170
00:09:24,785 --> 00:09:29,265
hot standby replicas for zero
time geo distributor deployments.

171
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,315
So that's.

172
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:37,075
That's super, super critical in
terms of having real, like your

173
00:09:37,405 --> 00:09:39,085
well-defined deployment strategies.

174
00:09:39,115 --> 00:09:43,525
On the next slide, it's on about
real-time monitoring and alerting systems.

175
00:09:43,985 --> 00:09:47,765
This is where all of the key technical
metrics would be like, what is

176
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:50,915
the latency, what is the triple,
what is your resource utilization?

177
00:09:51,255 --> 00:09:53,505
Is it at the max resource
utilization main?

178
00:09:53,865 --> 00:09:55,665
Main resource utilization?

179
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,990
So that you can dynamically at runtime
either increase the capacity or

180
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,530
reduce the capacities, and so you can
also actually track the error rates.

181
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,410
The key other thing is the
model performance, right?

182
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,080
Predicting what is the accuracy of it?

183
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,860
What are the drift in
terms of distribution?

184
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,450
How is that being used?

185
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,590
And of course.

186
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:17,415
Pertaining to that would be the business
KPIs in terms of what are the approval

187
00:10:17,415 --> 00:10:20,475
rate, what are false positive, how
is it impacting the revenue, customer

188
00:10:20,475 --> 00:10:21,645
experience, and all those things.

189
00:10:22,145 --> 00:10:25,245
And lastly compliance
is a key aspect of it.

190
00:10:25,245 --> 00:10:30,065
So ensuring that the end-to-end
transaction is thought through in terms of

191
00:10:30,335 --> 00:10:33,255
observability and reliability standpoint.

192
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:38,040
And what are the various automated
validation frameworks you have?

193
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,470
You have data validation, you
have model training, performance

194
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,610
and fairness, explaining the
compliance side of the world.

195
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,660
Financial institutions have
to ensure that the validation

196
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,040
processes needs to be there.

197
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,940
Otherwise, how do you know the robustness
and the accuracy of a particular

198
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,420
model before you go ahead and deploy
that in production and thereby.

199
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,770
You don't want to have such a scenario
where you don't validate and deploy it

200
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,980
in production, and then all of a sudden
it can have negative impact across the

201
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,150
length and breadth of the spectrum.

202
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:14,190
And then the next slide is about, I
would want to speak about like the

203
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,290
model drift in high stakes environments.

204
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,015
Like what exactly is a model done?

205
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:21,540
You just cannot avoid, model drift, right?

206
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,170
It's unavoidable in a, especially
in a high stakes environment, right?

207
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:29,680
How do you detect dread drift
through statistical tests segment

208
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,530
based analysis and, whenever a
drift occurs, how do you respond?

209
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,290
You respond through shadow
deployment comparison.

210
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:42,300
You gradually ramp wrap the traffic,
ramp down the traffic, and then that

211
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,530
is where when in doubt you have a back
fall back approach of human in the loop

212
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:52,230
approval and then track the audit trail
to make sure that the performances

213
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,390
through transitions is seamless.

214
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,640
And then I would also want to
speak about implementing AB

215
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,260
testing for financial models.

216
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,500
That's, that is where e testing is
another area which is super critical.

217
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,280
Start with clear hypothesis type
to business metric test designs.

218
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,870
Ensure statistical rigor, ensure carefully
and control for adverse effects and

219
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,090
practice analyzed at the segment level.

220
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,730
And rollout is progressive
with continuous monitoring?

221
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,050
Yes.

222
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:23,690
Innovation is the key, but not at the cost
of, not protecting the customers, right?

223
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,560
Safe AB testing is super important.

224
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,540
So to wrap up, what are
my key takeaways, right?

225
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,290
Design for scale from day one, integrate
compliance throughout the pipeline,

226
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,770
automate everything, but ensure the
fallback mechanisms are there, where

227
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,540
human in the loop intervention is there.

228
00:12:37,865 --> 00:12:41,525
And then investing in robust
monitoring and response systems.

229
00:12:42,005 --> 00:12:46,535
That's pretty much it, and I
hope you, you were able to gather

230
00:12:46,535 --> 00:12:49,205
some insights on my presentation.

231
00:12:49,205 --> 00:12:51,005
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

232
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:51,625
I.
