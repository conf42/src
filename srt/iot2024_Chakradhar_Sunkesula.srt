00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,070
Hello everyone and welcome
to Con 42 IoT Conference.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,109
I'm Chakradar Sunkeswala, an
engineering manager with nearly two

3
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:10,700
decades of experience in building
cloud platforms and applications.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,689
I'm excited to have you here
today as we dive into one of the

5
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:16,310
most critical topics in tech.

6
00:00:16,994 --> 00:00:19,714
Cloud security with cloud
computing, transforming

7
00:00:19,714 --> 00:00:21,144
industries and driving growth.

8
00:00:21,544 --> 00:00:25,284
It's crucial to understand the
security challenges that come with it.

9
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:31,214
I'm looking forward to share an innovative
multi layered security framework that

10
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:34,915
addresses these challenges and ensures
the safety of cloud environments.

11
00:00:35,524 --> 00:00:39,675
Let's get started and I'm and make
the most of this exciting session.

12
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:44,905
Cloud computing is transforming industries
worldwide, offering unprecedented

13
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:46,955
scalability, efficiency and innovation.

14
00:00:47,455 --> 00:00:52,115
As business increasingly rely on
cloud technologies, the need to secure

15
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:55,345
sensitive data and infrastructure
has never been more urgent.

16
00:00:56,345 --> 00:01:02,844
In 2023, global cloud services
spent, spending reached, 545.

17
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:03,474
8 billion.

18
00:01:04,284 --> 00:01:07,604
and is projected to grow
significantly by 2027.

19
00:01:08,424 --> 00:01:15,894
With this rapid expansion coming, comes a
rise in security risks as well, making the

20
00:01:15,894 --> 00:01:21,984
robust cloud security solutions essential
for protecting modern enterprises.

21
00:01:22,785 --> 00:01:25,984
In this session, we'll explore
a comprehensive multi layered

22
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:29,944
security framework designed to
address these challenges head on.

23
00:01:30,444 --> 00:01:33,274
As cloud adoption continues
to grow rapidly, Thank you

24
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,879
Organizations are facing a range
of evolving security challenges.

25
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:41,449
The traditional models are
simply not designed to handle.

26
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:47,899
In fact, Businesses today experience
an average of 43 cloud security

27
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:52,449
incidents every month and alarmingly
75 percent of these incidents are

28
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,489
preventable with better security
practices and proactive measures.

29
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,269
Despite this, many companies continue
to rely on outdated perimeter based

30
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:06,839
security models, which focus on
protecting the network's outer edges.

31
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:09,699
These models were designed for on premise.

32
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,599
environments and simply don't account
for the complexity and fluidity

33
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,559
of modern cloud infrastructures.

34
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:20,459
To make matters worse, there is a
global shortage of cybersecurity

35
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,339
professionals with an estimated gap of
around four million skilled workers.

36
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:28,019
The shortage is putting even more
pressure on the organizations to

37
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:32,449
secure their cloud environments without
the necessary resources leading to

38
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,669
overworked teams and security gaps.

39
00:02:35,594 --> 00:02:39,814
The combination of these factors,
high volumes of security incidents,

40
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:45,294
inadequate security models, and staffing
shortages underscore the urgent need

41
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:50,394
for more advanced, scalable, and
proactive cloud security solutions.

42
00:02:51,114 --> 00:02:58,069
As businesses rely more heavily on cloud
services, They need a robust framework

43
00:02:58,329 --> 00:02:59,879
that addresses these challenges.

44
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:03,579
One that can scale and adapt
to the rapidly changing

45
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:05,379
security landscape of cloud.

46
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,729
This is exactly what we are
going to dive into today.

47
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:12,989
To address the ever evolving
challenges in cloud security, we

48
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,209
have developed a comprehensive
multi layered security framework.

49
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:20,359
This framework is designed
to provide robust protection

50
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:22,540
across several critical layers.

51
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:27,675
Thank you focusing on key aspects that
ensuring the security, resilience,

52
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:29,954
adaptability of cloud infrastructures.

53
00:03:30,755 --> 00:03:33,804
The framework is built
around four core pillars.

54
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,350
network security, authentication,
authorization, and API security.

55
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,420
Each of these layers is integrated
with advanced security principles like

56
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,509
zero trust, sophisticated detection
mechanisms, and continuous monitoring.

57
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:53,520
Network security focuses on ensuring that
communication within the cloud is secure.

58
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,120
Implementing measures like segmentation
and dynamic access control to

59
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,440
prevent unauthorized access.

60
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,220
Authentication ensures that
only legitimate users can access

61
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,170
the cloud environment, using
techniques such as sophisticated

62
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,529
profiling and token security.

63
00:04:10,029 --> 00:04:15,129
Authorization enforces the principle
of least privilege, making sure users

64
00:04:15,179 --> 00:04:20,749
only have access to resources they need,
while API security protects the integrity

65
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:25,359
of communication between services and
preventing vulnerabilities and exploits.

66
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:31,699
By combining these layers, we create a
holistic defense system that not only

67
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:36,149
addresses current security risks, but
also adapts to the future threats.

68
00:04:37,049 --> 00:04:40,619
The framework provides a proactive
and a scalable approach to cloud

69
00:04:40,619 --> 00:04:45,369
security, ensuring your organization's
cloud infrastructure remains secure

70
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:47,069
no matter how fast we evolve.

71
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:50,849
Network security is a foundational
pillar in protecting cloud

72
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:55,484
environments, and the concept of zero
trust is central to our approach.

73
00:04:56,064 --> 00:04:59,884
In traditional network security
models, we often assume that once

74
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:04,034
the user or the devices inside
the network, they can be trusted.

75
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:09,264
However, with cloud environments being
more dynamic and distributed, we can

76
00:05:09,274 --> 00:05:10,824
no longer afford this assumption.

77
00:05:11,764 --> 00:05:17,514
The zero trust model operates under the
principle of never trust, always verify,

78
00:05:18,174 --> 00:05:20,244
meaning every request is authenticated.

79
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:24,109
and authorized before granting
access regardless of its origin.

80
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:28,909
In practice, we implement zero
trust services, isolation,

81
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:30,789
and dynamic access controls.

82
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,779
Critical components are
segmented into separate subnets.

83
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:39,969
Front end services, back end services,
and databases are isolated to ensure

84
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:44,609
that even if an attacker compromises
on one segment, they cannot easily

85
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:46,339
move laterally across the network.

86
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:50,609
This approach has resulted
in an 85 percent reduction

87
00:05:50,869 --> 00:05:52,589
in lateral movement attacks.

88
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:59,369
Furthermore, we enforce dynamic access
control policies where strict IP

89
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:01,729
routing and traffic rules are applied.

90
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:08,129
These rules ensure that only
authorized traffic and can interact

91
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:12,389
with critical cloud services,
significantly reducing the potential

92
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:14,819
for unauthorized access and R attack.

93
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:20,259
By adopting these zero trust principles,
we can successfully thwart 99.

94
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:26,479
97 percent of password and
encryption keys theft attempts.

95
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:31,244
Providing a robust defense
against common attack vectors.

96
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:35,984
Beyond the foundational zero trust
principles, our network security

97
00:06:35,984 --> 00:06:40,244
framework incorporates advanced
detection systems to further

98
00:06:40,254 --> 00:06:42,614
strengthen the defense against threats.

99
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:48,339
One of the key technologies here is
AAML driven traffic analysis, which

100
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:52,529
continuously monitors network traffic
and analyzes patterns at scale.

101
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:58,629
By using machine learning algorithms,
we can identify unusual behavior and

102
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:00,679
potential threats with high accuracy.

103
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:04,739
These systems have achieved a
92 percent reduction in false

104
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:07,399
positive, while maintaining 99.

105
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,679
2 percent accuracy in
identifying true threats.

106
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:15,439
Ensuring that our security team
focuses only on relevant alerts.

107
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:18,739
Another crucial element in
our detection system is the

108
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:19,959
implementation of digital tripwires.

109
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:24,039
These are strategically placed
to detect unauthorized access or

110
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:25,899
unusual activities in the real time.

111
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:30,369
When triggered, these tripwires
automatically alert the security

112
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:33,704
team and the initiate immediate,
containment procedures.

113
00:07:34,494 --> 00:07:39,424
This capability has helped reduce
the threat dwell time to less than 24

114
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:44,074
hours with automated response systems
neutralizing the threat in less than

115
00:07:44,074 --> 00:07:45,514
15 milliseconds of the detection.

116
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:51,019
Together, these advanced detection
measures Provide an extra layers of

117
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:55,179
security that actively identifies
and mitigates risks in real

118
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:58,789
time, significantly enhancing the
overall resilience of the network.

119
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:03,819
Authentication is a critical layer
of security in the cloud, and our

120
00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:08,059
approach goes beyond traditional
methods by incorporating sophisticated

121
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:09,469
user classification system.

122
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,709
Unlike basic username and password
mechanisms, our authentication system.

123
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:19,669
analyzes user behavior across
multiple dimensions to assess the

124
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:21,959
legitimacy of the each access attempt.

125
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:27,189
This includes factors like login
location, device type and usage

126
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:29,709
path, and even the time of access.

127
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:35,449
By profiling user behavior in real
time, we can identify the block 99.

128
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:39,999
7 percent of credential abuse
attempts before they even happen.

129
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,379
We process over 1.

130
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,399
2 million authentication
requests daily with the response

131
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,089
times under 200 milliseconds.

132
00:08:47,634 --> 00:08:51,734
ensuring that the security does not
come at the cost of user experience.

133
00:08:52,634 --> 00:08:56,414
The system is designed to scale
effectively, handling massive

134
00:08:56,414 --> 00:08:59,544
volumes of requests while
maintaining speed and accuracy.

135
00:09:00,434 --> 00:09:04,094
Moreover, our authentication
process is continuously evolving

136
00:09:04,124 --> 00:09:05,114
through adaptive testing.

137
00:09:05,774 --> 00:09:11,114
We simulate new attack vectors and use
AI driven attack simulation to test

138
00:09:11,154 --> 00:09:15,344
and strengthen the system, ensuring
it stays ahead of emerging threats.

139
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:20,209
This continuously evolution, this
continuous evolution of our user

140
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:25,419
classification system provides dynamic
real time protection against unauthorized

141
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:29,789
access, enhancing both security and
efficiency of cloud environments.

142
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:34,499
Token security is a vital aspect
of authentication, especially

143
00:09:34,499 --> 00:09:37,919
in cloud environments where
scalability and flexibility are key.

144
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:43,359
Traditional static tokens are
vulnerable to exploitation over time.

145
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:48,029
So we have implemented a more
dynamic and secure approach using

146
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:53,459
advanced cryptographic protocols
and distributed trust architectures.

147
00:09:54,199 --> 00:10:00,419
We process over 500, 000 token validations
per minute, ensuring secure authentication

148
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,769
across large scale cloud applications.

149
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:08,939
Our system uses risk based token
lifetimes, which dynamically adjusts

150
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:13,399
the validity of a period of each
token based upon user behavior

151
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:14,919
and other environmental factors.

152
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:18,779
This drastically reduces the
window of opportunity for

153
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:22,559
potential token exploitation,
cutting successful exploitation

154
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,549
attempts by 91 percent compared to
traditional fixed lifetime tokens.

155
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:32,369
In addition to risk based lifetimes,
We manage over a thousand trusted

156
00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:36,869
issuers in real time, verifying
every token as it's issued.

157
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:39,799
This distributed approach prevents 99.

158
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,169
98 percent of certificate based
attacks, ensuring that only

159
00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:48,509
trusted verified tokens are used to
access sensitive cloud resources.

160
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:54,089
By combining advanced cryptographic
methods with continuous verification,

161
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:59,139
we provide highly secure and scalable
authentication that adapts to the

162
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:00,829
needs of modern cloud environments.

163
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:05,429
One of the most powerful features
of our authentication system is

164
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:09,069
the kill switch mechanism, which
provides real time protection

165
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:10,799
in the event of security breach.

166
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:16,909
This mechanism allows to instantly
revoke access across all contexts

167
00:11:17,249 --> 00:11:20,199
when suspicious behavior is detected.

168
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:23,029
It operates in under 100 milliseconds.

169
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:28,934
ensuring that no compromised credential
can be used to access sensitive systems.

170
00:11:29,434 --> 00:11:33,934
The kill switch works by continuously
analyzing over 30 distinct behavioral

171
00:11:34,384 --> 00:11:37,334
patterns to identify anomalies.

172
00:11:37,844 --> 00:11:44,374
These patterns can include unusual login
times, access from unfamiliar locations,

173
00:11:44,674 --> 00:11:46,894
or abnormal transaction volumes.

174
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:52,699
When a deviation from the user's typical
behavior is detected, the system triggers

175
00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:57,919
a kill switch, immediately locking
down any potential malicious sessions.

176
00:11:58,859 --> 00:12:01,879
This proactive response has 95.

177
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:05,229
3 percent accuracy in
identifying unauthorized

178
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:06,949
activities before they escalate.

179
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:12,069
The ability to revoke access so quickly
prevents attacker from maintaining a

180
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:18,174
foothold in the system and significantly
reduces The risk off for their damage.

181
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:22,784
Additionally, the kill switch is
backed by granular access controls,

182
00:12:23,364 --> 00:12:30,774
allowing us to manage over 1000 distinct
permission combinations, reduces reducing

183
00:12:31,134 --> 00:12:33,604
unauthorized access incidents by 95%.

184
00:12:34,104 --> 00:12:40,474
By combining real time behavior analytics
and rapid access revocation, we add

185
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:46,154
another layer of defense to protect
cloud environments against Intrusions.

186
00:12:46,654 --> 00:12:51,854
Authorization plays a critical role in
ensuring that users and systems only have

187
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:56,914
access to the resources they absolutely
need, which is where the principle

188
00:12:56,914 --> 00:12:58,564
of least privilege comes into play.

189
00:12:59,244 --> 00:13:04,184
Our framework enforces this
principle by carefully managing user

190
00:13:04,224 --> 00:13:09,434
permissions and ensuring that access
is continuously evaluated and adjusted

191
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:12,314
based on real time needs and risks.

192
00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:14,414
We process over 1.

193
00:13:14,414 --> 00:13:16,434
5 million authorization decisions daily.

194
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:21,714
Ensuring that every access request
is thoroughly checked and validated

195
00:13:21,714 --> 00:13:24,354
against the least privileged standard.

196
00:13:25,044 --> 00:13:29,154
This is especially important in
large dynamic cloud environments,

197
00:13:29,624 --> 00:13:33,454
where the number of users and
resources is constantly changing.

198
00:13:34,364 --> 00:13:38,904
Our system automatically detects
and revokes any excess privileges,

199
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:45,484
preventing issues like privilege creep,
where users inadvertently accumulate.

200
00:13:45,904 --> 00:13:48,574
more access than they need over time.

201
00:13:49,404 --> 00:13:53,784
Additionally, we ensure audit
compliance by continuously reviewing

202
00:13:54,164 --> 00:13:58,094
and updating permissions to match
the principle of least privilege.

203
00:13:59,084 --> 00:14:01,154
This approach has significantly reduced.

204
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:07,844
Privilege related audit findings by
95, 91%, allowing organizations to

205
00:14:07,844 --> 00:14:12,174
maintain a secure, compliant cloud
environment without unnecessary

206
00:14:12,204 --> 00:14:18,204
administrative overhead by implementing
granular permission management and

207
00:14:18,264 --> 00:14:20,884
continuous evaluating access levels.

208
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:26,759
We ensure that users have exactly the
access they need and no more, reducing

209
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:34,089
the, and, sorry, and reducing this
attack surface and minimizing the risk

210
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:37,089
of insider threats or accidental misuse.

211
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:41,839
Reducing the attack surface is critical
part of securing any cloud environment.

212
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:47,079
And our approach to authorization is
designed to minimize opportunities

213
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:48,519
for unauthorized access.

214
00:14:49,444 --> 00:14:54,524
By analyzing more than 50 million
daily access events, we can detect

215
00:14:54,554 --> 00:14:59,304
and prevent attempts to exploit
vulnerabilities before they escalate.

216
00:14:59,804 --> 00:15:06,034
One of the key strategies we use
is continuous permission auditing.

217
00:15:06,744 --> 00:15:10,934
This allows us to identify and
revoke excessive privileges

218
00:15:10,935 --> 00:15:12,364
and permissions quickly.

219
00:15:13,054 --> 00:15:17,404
We use advanced segmentation techniques
to limit the scope of access.

220
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:22,369
Which means, even if an attacker
compromises one part of the

221
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:27,249
network, they can't easily move
laterally to access other resources.

222
00:15:27,859 --> 00:15:32,339
This access scope limitation reduces
the time it takes to detect unauthorized

223
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:37,889
access, cutting detection times from
127 hours to less than 3 minutes.

224
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:43,839
In addition, we employ dynamic privilege
adjustments, processing more than 3

225
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,379
million privilege modifications daily,
based on real time risk assessments.

226
00:15:49,144 --> 00:15:54,334
This ensures that the user is, user
access is constantly aligned with the

227
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:59,374
current security posture and unnecessary
privileges are promptly revoked.

228
00:16:00,064 --> 00:16:04,984
These measures combined with rapid
privilege revocation have reduced the

229
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:09,804
average time to revoke compromised
privileges from 12 hours to under less

230
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:14,474
than 50 milliseconds, significantly
improving response times and minimizing

231
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,214
the window of opportunity for attackers.

232
00:16:17,714 --> 00:16:22,334
APIs are the backbone of modern
cloud applications, enabling

233
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:27,244
communication between services, but
they also represent a major attack

234
00:16:27,784 --> 00:16:29,804
vector, if not properly secure.

235
00:16:30,634 --> 00:16:34,064
To mitigate these risks, we have
implemented a comprehensive API

236
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:38,274
request validation system that
processes billions of requests daily.

237
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:41,676
Our system is designed to prevent 99.

238
00:16:41,676 --> 00:16:47,034
97 percent of attempted exploits while
ensuring minimal impact on performance.

239
00:16:47,534 --> 00:16:48,024
processing 2.

240
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:52,534
3 billion API requests per day with the
response times under 50 milliseconds.

241
00:16:53,414 --> 00:16:57,774
This is achieved through a combination
of schema enforcement, rate limiting,

242
00:16:57,804 --> 00:16:59,744
and advanced input sanitization.

243
00:17:00,484 --> 00:17:03,984
Schema enforcement ensures that
all incoming requests strictly

244
00:17:04,244 --> 00:17:09,644
adhere to predefined data formats,
reducing the likelihood of malicious

245
00:17:09,664 --> 00:17:11,424
input bypass security checks.

246
00:17:12,094 --> 00:17:16,054
In addition, rate limiting protects
against denial of service attacks

247
00:17:16,474 --> 00:17:20,264
by ensuring that APIs can only
handle a certain amount of requests

248
00:17:20,304 --> 00:17:21,844
within a certain time frame.

249
00:17:22,774 --> 00:17:27,074
This protects the backend system from
being overwhelmed and maintains stability.

250
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:33,829
Finally, advanced input sanitization is
used to Prevent common attacks such as

251
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:36,029
SQL injection or cross site scripting.

252
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:41,109
By ensuring that all users inputs
are thoroughly sanitized before being

253
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:47,529
processed, by incorporating these measures
into API, into our API security layer, we

254
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:55,959
ensure that only safe, legitimate requests
are processed, providing a first line

255
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:57,869
of defense against malicious activity.

256
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:03,229
While validating API requests is
essential, it's equally important to

257
00:18:03,229 --> 00:18:07,299
detect unusual behavior in real time
to prevent sophisticated attacks.

258
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:13,049
Our anomaly detection system leverages
advanced machine learning models trained

259
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:18,529
on more than 500 billion API requests to
identify unusual patterns and behaviors.

260
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:23,799
These models analyze over 1 million
requests per second, evaluating

261
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:28,869
235 distinct parameters for each
transaction to ensure accuracy

262
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:30,669
and depth in threat detection.

263
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:35,419
One of the standard features of this
system is dynamic baseline monitoring.

264
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,189
which continuously learns and
adjusts thresholds based on

265
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,189
a real time usage patterns.

266
00:18:41,689 --> 00:18:47,759
With 89 distinct API usage patterns
tracked, the system can differentiate

267
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,249
between normal fluctuations in
behavior and genuine threats.

268
00:18:52,209 --> 00:18:58,589
This approach has reduced false positives
by 94%, ensuring security teams focus

269
00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:01,169
their efforts on legitimate incidents.

270
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:04,379
Additionally, the system maintains a 99.

271
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:07,219
99 percent detection rate for
genuine security incidents.

272
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:14,099
Offering Unparallel unparalleled
reliability by proactively identifying

273
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:15,929
and responding to anomalies.

274
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:21,769
This layer of framework adds an extra
layer to of security, especially against

275
00:19:21,979 --> 00:19:27,289
zero day vulnerabilities or novel attacks,
attack vector that may not yet be known.

276
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:34,089
These capabilities ensure that our APIs
remain not only functional and performant,

277
00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:36,549
but also secure against evolving threats.

278
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:42,679
Our multi layered security framework has
had a profound impact on how organizations

279
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,529
secure their cloud environments.

280
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:49,329
By combining advanced technologies
with scalable security principles,

281
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,689
we have achieved remarkable results.

282
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:54,209
For instance, the framework provides a 99.

283
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:59,599
97 percent detection rate for
sophisticated attacks, reducing

284
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,599
the detection times by 94 percent
compared to traditional systems.

285
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:08,059
These improvements not only
enhance security, but also

286
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:09,529
drastically lower costs.

287
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,429
With organizations reporting an average
of 76 percent reduction in the cost.

288
00:20:14,884 --> 00:20:15,704
per security incident.

289
00:20:16,204 --> 00:20:20,144
What makes this framework particularly
effective is its adaptability.

290
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:25,084
It is designed to evolve alongside
emerging threats, ensuring

291
00:20:25,274 --> 00:20:28,934
it remains relevant as cloud
environments grow more complex.

continuously meet, continuous to
meet the security needs of tomorrow.

295
00:20:44,764 --> 00:20:49,904
Looking ahead, the focus is more
on integrating AI driven automation

296
00:20:49,924 --> 00:20:53,284
to predict and prevent potential
threats before they materialize.

297
00:20:53,784 --> 00:20:58,734
This includes leveraging advanced
analytics for proactive threat modeling

298
00:20:59,234 --> 00:21:04,144
and using real time telemetry to gain
even deeper insights into cloud behavior.

299
00:21:04,954 --> 00:21:09,504
Ultimately, this framework isn't just
about addressing current challenges.

300
00:21:10,254 --> 00:21:12,984

Thank you all for taking the time
to join me today and explore the

306
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:36,999
critical challenges and innovative
solutions in the cloud security.

307
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:41,049
As we have seen, securing cloud
environments requires more

308
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:42,469
than just traditional methods.

309
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,979
It demands a proactive,
multi layered approach that

310
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:47,469
evolves with emerging threats.

311
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:52,769
