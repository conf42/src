1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,480
Welcome.

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,620
Welcome everyone.

3
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:07,920
Today we are going to explore a unique
and holistic framework for UX design.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,230
We will be looking at how ancient
wisdom of the chakra system can be

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,760
applied to modern digital product
design and create more meaningful

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,040
and human-centered experience.

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,599
Now, I have a question to ask you guys.

8
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:26,990
Do you have unresolved
feelings or anxiety about.

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,380
Is my idea complete enough?

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,090
Are people enjoying my product or
have I covered all my use cases?

11
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,520
Now let's focus on, have I
covered all my use cases?

12
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,800
That sounds tense, right?

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:49,660
I want to shift the focus and talk about
particular subset of the use cases, edge

14
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,590
cases, because we often forget about that.

15
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:00,150
I want us to figure out how we can design
products for the whole human experience.

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,879
Talking about the human experience.

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,860
Hi, I am Prish.

18
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,890
I am a human computer interaction
expert based in New York City, and I'm

19
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,470
a person who wants to try everything.

20
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,020
I'm a person who is looking for
always finding new tools all the time.

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,785
I. Love it when it works, and
I also hate it when it doesn't.

22
00:01:25,175 --> 00:01:30,005
I am an easily be easily trustable person.

23
00:01:30,505 --> 00:01:35,355
I'm very sure that I resonate with a
lot of you guys today, and that is why

24
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:41,804
I want us to look at how we can create
solutions that touch on all the edge cases

25
00:01:41,925 --> 00:01:45,315
of the human experience chakra system.

26
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:50,729
I am going to apply it as a
framework for conscious design in ux.

27
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:55,159
I'm very sure that all of you have
heard about these chakras, whether

28
00:01:55,849 --> 00:02:03,019
reading about it in yoga, meditation,
ancient Hindu text, or even when

29
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,779
watching and reading Japanese manga.

30
00:02:06,589 --> 00:02:09,199
Yes, they are in Japanese manga as well.

31
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,609
So are we just building for clicks?

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,299
As designers, we are often
pushed to focus on metrics, but

33
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:20,609
what is the impact of our work?

34
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:27,470
Metrics often is a success measured
by engagement, go conversion rate

35
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:35,165
retention, but all of this can lead to
addictive patterns, digital anxiety, and

36
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:38,045
a disconnect from the real human needs.

37
00:02:38,545 --> 00:02:43,135
Conscious design, ask us to look beyond
the surface level interaction and consider

38
00:02:43,675 --> 00:02:49,435
the user's entire experience emotionally,
intellectually, and even spiritually.

39
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:54,285
Designing with awareness, empathy,
and a deeper understanding of

40
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:59,120
users' holistic wellbeing will
create a very well-rounded product.

41
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,545
Let's briefly touch on the
foundations of this framework.

42
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,600
The chakra system is an ancient
model for understanding ourselves.

43
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:14,930
It's the word chakra is derived from
Sanskrit, which means wheel or a disc, and

44
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:19,940
it's about connectedness and it's about
revolving and going around and repeating.

45
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,370
They're considered energy centers
in the body each corresponding to

46
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,970
different aspects of our physical,
emotional, and psychological be.

47
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,030
There are seven main chakras in
our Hindu mythology, and they're

48
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,500
arranged vertically from the base of
the spine to the crown of the head.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,980
Think of it as a map of human experience,
and it's not about believing in literal

50
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:48,320
energy centers, but about using the
system as a powerful metaphor to ensure

51
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,810
we are designing for the whole person.

52
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,170
Each chakra represents a core human need.

53
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,590
Here are the seven chakras and
the core need they represent.

54
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,040
You can see how they build upon each
other, just Maslow's hierarchy of needs

55
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,100
from basic survival to higher purpose.

56
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,940
The first chakra, which is at
the base of the human spine,

57
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,520
is root chakra called muha.

58
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,110
It's about security,
survival, and stability.

59
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:23,320
The one above it called
sacral chakra, Swedish tanana.

60
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,220
It's about creativity,
pleasure, and emotions.

61
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,070
The next one called the solar plexus
Chakra, also known as manipura.

62
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:39,120
It's about power will
self-esteem, and being in control,

63
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,100
controlling the environment.

64
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,390
Controlling yourself.

65
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:49,190
The next one is heart chakra, and
all of these next four chakras are

66
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:54,740
going beyond yourself, beyond your
human body, and embarking into

67
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,600
the social aspects of human need.

68
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:03,380
It's about connection with your
world, your people, and beyond that.

69
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:10,040
So the heart chakra, also known as anhata,
is about love, connection, and empathy.

70
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,840
And understanding people
beyond you and yourself.

71
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,980
Love for yourself and love for others.

72
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,700
Throat chakra, also known as
vta, it's about communication,

73
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,620
truth and self-expression.

74
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,070
It's not about voice,
it's about communication.

75
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,285
Are you able to express what you feel?

76
00:05:32,785 --> 00:05:35,125
Third, a chakra, also known as ajna.

77
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:38,785
It's about intuition,
wisdom, and imagination.

78
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:42,825
And the last one is crown
chakra, also known as Sahara.

79
00:05:43,325 --> 00:05:46,685
It's about spirituality,
purpose, and unity.

80
00:05:47,185 --> 00:05:52,175
Let's map these needs directly to UX
design principles, one by one, and how

81
00:05:52,175 --> 00:05:56,135
we can use these ancient wisdom methods.

82
00:05:56,795 --> 00:06:01,775
To activate connections of
people with our digital products.

83
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:05,110
So the first chakra, the root
chakra, also called mul tarara.

84
00:06:05,485 --> 00:06:07,645
It's about security and survival.

85
00:06:08,515 --> 00:06:15,265
The core needs for this is, does this
product feel safe, stable and reliable.

86
00:06:15,765 --> 00:06:18,615
Core UX principles you can
use here are usability.

87
00:06:19,215 --> 00:06:22,895
Is the product easy to use
and navigate reliability?

88
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,930
Does it work as expected or does it
have any bugs or crashes and security?

89
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,370
Is my data safe?

90
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,260
Is my privacy respected?

91
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,500
Everything starts at the root.

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,870
If the user doesn't feel safe, or
if the product constantly crashes

93
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,030
and fails, they will leave.

94
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,600
They will never create a bond
between your product and themselves.

95
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,720
This is the foundation
of the user's trust.

96
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,580
This corresponds to the most basic
level of usability heuristics.

97
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,570
For an example, if a banking app inside
that you must have a rock solid security

98
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,970
and in it should be incredibly reliable.

99
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,570
If it fails here, no
other feature matters.

100
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,710
The next one is Sacral chakra,
also known as Swedish Tanana.

101
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,290
It's about creativity and pleasure.

102
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:18,920
Once the basics are covered, we
move on to how the product feels.

103
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:25,470
The core needs for this is the product
enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing?

104
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,400
Is it a CHO to use or is it a pleasure?

105
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,910
The UX principles that you
can use here are aesthetics.

106
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,770
Is the visual design appealing
and appropriate joy of use?

107
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,620
Does the product create
moments of delight?

108
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,900
Like micro interactions or animations, or
are we celebrating small victories there?

109
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,700
And creativity Does the product
allow for users' expression?

110
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:55,059
This is where beautiful design, satisfying
animations and features that empower

111
00:07:55,299 --> 00:07:57,159
users' creativity come into play.

112
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,720
For example, Instagram's filter
and creative tools allow users

113
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,790
to express themselves, making
them experiencing pleasure.

114
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,200
The next one is slow, so sorry.

115
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,720
Solar Plexus Chakra.

116
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,650
That's a mouthful.

117
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:18,380
The Solar Plexus Chakra, also known as
Money Pura is about power and self-esteem.

118
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,920
The core need for this is,
does this product make me

119
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,080
freely capable and in control?

120
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,980
This chakra is about the
user sense of agency.

121
00:08:27,895 --> 00:08:31,585
A well-designed product should
feel like powerful tool in user's

122
00:08:31,585 --> 00:08:33,955
hand and not a confusing maze.

123
00:08:33,955 --> 00:08:37,945
That is a burden to use, and
then they have to fight through

124
00:08:38,245 --> 00:08:40,675
just to get basic work out of it.

125
00:08:41,175 --> 00:08:45,275
User control and freedom users
can easily undo mistakes.

126
00:08:45,515 --> 00:08:47,495
Can they customize their experiences?

127
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:50,095
The next principle you
can use is efficiency.

128
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:53,665
Does the product help users
A, achieve their goals

129
00:08:53,725 --> 00:08:55,885
effectively and feel productive?

130
00:08:56,385 --> 00:09:01,035
The next one you can use is empowerment,
which is does this tool make users

131
00:09:01,035 --> 00:09:03,375
feel smarter and more powerful?

132
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:08,585
We empower users by giving them clear
controls, customization options,

133
00:09:08,645 --> 00:09:10,450
and efficient part to their goals.

134
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:11,570
For example.

135
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:16,330
A project management tool like
Notion or Asana empowers users

136
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:20,380
by giving them control over their
workflow and complex lives and make

137
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,210
them feel organized and capable.

138
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,200
This is where it activates
their solar Plexus chara.

139
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,500
The next one, as I said, is beyond you.

140
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,020
It's now creating experiences and
connections with you and the world.

141
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,375
It's the heart chakra.

142
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,515
Also known as anhata.

143
00:09:40,725 --> 00:09:42,705
It's about love and connection.

144
00:09:43,205 --> 00:09:47,915
The core need for this chakra is does
this product connect me with others?

145
00:09:48,485 --> 00:09:50,495
Does the company care about me?

146
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:55,685
It's not only just me connecting
to the world is if your product

147
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:57,305
is able to connect with me.

148
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,325
The UX principles that you
can use here are empathy.

149
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:04,495
Does the design show an understanding
of the user's feeling and context?

150
00:10:05,335 --> 00:10:06,055
Community.

151
00:10:06,445 --> 00:10:09,715
Does this product foster a sense
of belonging and connection

152
00:10:09,715 --> 00:10:12,145
between the users and support?

153
00:10:12,805 --> 00:10:14,455
Is it easy to get help?

154
00:10:14,755 --> 00:10:17,335
Does the customer support
feel human and caring?

155
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:21,535
This is often what is not
happening in the world anymore.

156
00:10:21,895 --> 00:10:25,045
If you are stuck in a problem,
you are stuck with an AI agent.

157
00:10:25,545 --> 00:10:29,355
This is where we move from
individual to the collective.

158
00:10:29,775 --> 00:10:30,915
We are social creators.

159
00:10:31,415 --> 00:10:36,395
Great UX Design fosters community
and shows that the company behind

160
00:10:36,395 --> 00:10:40,805
the product genuinely cares for its
users through thoughtful support

161
00:10:40,805 --> 00:10:42,425
and empathetic design choices.

162
00:10:43,085 --> 00:10:48,755
For example, social features, community
forums, and genuinely helping and

163
00:10:48,935 --> 00:10:52,710
being empathetic to customer service,
all caters to the human chakra.

164
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,890
It creates a bonding between
you and the product, and you.

165
00:10:57,485 --> 00:11:00,125
This is really important
to activate heart chakra.

166
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:04,015
The next one is throw chakra or vta.

167
00:11:04,975 --> 00:11:09,715
It's also about communication and
truth, not just communication.

168
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:10,885
It's about honesty.

169
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:15,485
The core need for this chakra
is the product's, communication,

170
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:17,735
clear, honest, and transparent.

171
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:20,855
The UX principles that you
can use here is clarity.

172
00:11:21,755 --> 00:11:25,865
Is the copy free of jargon and
easy to understand honesty.

173
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,725
Is the pricing transparent?

174
00:11:28,265 --> 00:11:29,855
Are there hidden features?

175
00:11:30,395 --> 00:11:32,585
Are all the features described accurately?

176
00:11:33,085 --> 00:11:35,335
What is the feedback that
I'm getting from the system?

177
00:11:36,325 --> 00:11:39,415
Does the system provide clear
feedback for all the user actions?

178
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:45,625
Is it showing me fake statuses or
is the real system's health that

179
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,365
is being shown on the system?

180
00:11:47,865 --> 00:11:51,315
Now as we move to the higher,
more subtle aspects of ux, the

181
00:11:51,315 --> 00:11:52,935
throat chakra is about product's.

182
00:11:52,935 --> 00:11:57,125
Voice tone, trust is built on
clear and honest communication.

183
00:11:57,485 --> 00:12:03,355
So this is where the UX writing
information architecture and how you

184
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:06,295
communicate with the users are critical.

185
00:12:06,795 --> 00:12:10,185
An example for this could be a
product with clear error messages.

186
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:16,800
Transparent pricing and straightforward
language bills, trust, and ensuring

187
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,940
that the users feels respected
and it's not taken for granted.

188
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,285
The sixth Chakra is the third I chakra,
also called Ajna, such a nice name.

189
00:12:28,185 --> 00:12:30,465
It's about intuition and wisdom.

190
00:12:31,215 --> 00:12:35,475
The core need for this chakra is
does this product feel intuitive?

191
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:38,355
Like it anticipates my need.

192
00:12:38,805 --> 00:12:39,825
Is it proactive?

193
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:41,445
Is it taking things care?

194
00:12:41,655 --> 00:12:47,065
It is it taking care of things before
I can even imagine a truly great

195
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:48,985
experience feels almost magical.

196
00:12:49,555 --> 00:12:51,355
This is the goal of the third eye chakra.

197
00:12:52,225 --> 00:12:56,865
The UX principles that you can use here
are intuitiveness can use as accomplished

198
00:12:57,015 --> 00:12:58,335
task without conscious effort.

199
00:12:58,835 --> 00:12:59,975
Personalization.

200
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:05,225
Does the experience adapt to
individual needs, or is it always

201
00:13:05,225 --> 00:13:09,225
that I have to start from scratch
every time I want to use it?

202
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:15,335
Does it save my status and context
and then jumps me right into action

203
00:13:15,665 --> 00:13:18,725
when I, where I left off continuity.

204
00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:24,795
If I leave my task on one system, does
it take me at the same state when I open

205
00:13:24,795 --> 00:13:26,805
the application on a different system?

206
00:13:27,615 --> 00:13:33,945
If I leave my playlist running on my
phone, can I continue the same song on my

207
00:13:33,945 --> 00:13:36,585
computer when I log into the same system?

208
00:13:37,085 --> 00:13:37,985
Anticipation.

209
00:13:38,615 --> 00:13:41,435
Does the product surface the right
information at the right time?

210
00:13:41,935 --> 00:13:45,955
This is achieved through deep
user research, smart defaults, and

211
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:50,845
effective personalizations that
makes user feel seen and understood.

212
00:13:51,345 --> 00:13:55,845
For example, a music streaming
services that create a perfect playlist

213
00:13:55,845 --> 00:14:00,545
based on your listening habits feels
like it's reading your mind now.

214
00:14:00,725 --> 00:14:04,175
It is also at the same time
activating your second.

215
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,950
And your heart chakras as well.

216
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:13,270
And this is where you can see activating
multiple chakras at the same time.

217
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:19,690
If through your product experience you
can create a deeper magical bonding with

218
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:24,090
your product and your users, that's why
it's very important, not just us, just

219
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,010
focus on one chara at a time, but try to.

220
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,500
Activate as many as chakras as possible.

221
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,440
The last chakra is about
knowledge, purpose, and your flow.

222
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,110
This is called the crown chakra.

223
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:43,560
It sits above your body
in a true ancient sense.

224
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,465
It's also called ra.

225
00:14:45,965 --> 00:14:47,340
The core needs for this.

226
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,860
Principle is, does this product
help me achieve a state of

227
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,930
flow or a higher purpose?

228
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,980
This is a pinnacle of
user experience design.

229
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:00,090
This is where the product
transcends into a function and

230
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,950
becomes a transformative tool.

231
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,020
At this level, the user is so
eng endorsed and empowered that

232
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,560
the product helps them achieve
something truly meaningful to them.

233
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,770
Something they probably didn't even think
of when they started using this product.

234
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,390
A lot of creative tools
sit in crown chakras.

235
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,350
Some of the UX princip that you
can use here are Flow State.

236
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:28,420
Does the tool allow for deep
uninterrupted focus transformation?

237
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,800
Does the product help users grow
or achieve meaningful goals or

238
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,930
meaning does the product aligns
with the user's value now?

239
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,520
For example a well-designed writing
app that minimizes distractions

240
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,980
and allow author to enter in a
state of flow clairvoyance and

241
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,360
becoming a seamless extension of
their creative process is a perfect

242
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,720
fitting for activating this chakra.

243
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:01,220
Once you activate this chakra through
your experiences, users and users

244
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,390
can create what they're imagining or
something that they haven't even imagined.

245
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,760
And creativity just flows out.

246
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:14,800
So I want to summarize all the seven
chakras into how it is it important

247
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,450
for designing for the whole human.

248
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:20,520
The more chakras you activate, the
more connection you can build, the

249
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:26,460
more effect that you can have on the
user, as well as their environment

250
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,410
as well, and their creativity.

251
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,970
The chakra system provides a
holistic checklist for the UX design.

252
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,950
It encourages us to move beyond
the basic usability and metrics.

253
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,290
By designing for these core human
needs, we can create products

254
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:46,520
that are not only successful, but
truly add value to people's life.

255
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,810
In the end, I just want you
to leave with these questions.

256
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,250
This you can use always as
guiding principles when activating

257
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,755
chakras through your products.

258
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,189
Is it reliable?

259
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,230
Is it enjoyable?

260
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,840
Is it empowering?

261
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,850
Is it connecting?

262
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,219
Is it clear?

263
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:04,739
Is it intuitive?

264
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,290
Is it transformative?

265
00:17:08,219 --> 00:17:13,710
And if you can activate all the chakras,
you will truly create a great product.

266
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:14,540
Thank you.

267
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,310
Bye.
