1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:00,889
Hey all.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:07,010
Today I'm here to talk about
quantum accelerated storage Systems.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,660
As enterprises data
volumes grow exponentially.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,465
Traditional storage and processing
systems are struggling to keep

5
00:00:14,645 --> 00:00:19,505
pace with the demands of realtime
analytics, mission learning, unsecured

6
00:00:19,535 --> 00:00:21,845
the data management in response.

7
00:00:22,145 --> 00:00:25,625
Quantum computing is emerging
as a transformative force

8
00:00:26,045 --> 00:00:31,565
redefining our enterprise store
retrieve and process data.

9
00:00:32,015 --> 00:00:36,905
One of the most promising innovations
in this space is the development of

10
00:00:37,295 --> 00:00:39,500
quantum accelerated storage systems.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,440
Let me introduce about myself.

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:47,849
I'm go lead solutions architect solutions
specialist in the cloud engineering area.

13
00:00:48,419 --> 00:00:54,280
I have around 17 years of experience
specifically focusing in data

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,410
engineering with a focus on cloud
technologies and automations.

15
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,840
I have consistently pioneered innovative
solutions that bridge technology gaps

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,450
and deliver measurable business impact.

17
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,320
My career has been defined by
developing cutting edge data

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,660
pipelines, cloud architectures that
have transformed operations across.

19
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,180
Multiple service lines such as healthcare,
insurance, and financial services.

20
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,100
I speared the implementation of
cloud-based data lake solutions that

21
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,300
revolutionized how organizations
can handle large scale of data

22
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,460
and storing them accordingly.

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,160
Let's move on to the topic the Quantum
Max accelerated storage Systems.

24
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:45,140
By integrating quantum processing units
pus with I based speed memory systems

25
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:50,420
and the classical infrastructure, the
enterprises can unlock unprecedented

26
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:56,785
performance for workloads such as realtime
fraud deduction, large scale and training.

27
00:01:57,215 --> 00:02:02,780
Furthermore, quantum algorithms
applied to data storage can optimize.

28
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,580
Hierarchical memory usage,
improve error correction, and

29
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:10,460
enable more efficient data.

30
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:16,670
Lifecycle management as a technology may
choose quantum accelerated storage systems

31
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,760
or poise to become em cornerstone of next
generation enterprise data architectures

32
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:28,400
offering not only speed and efficiency,
but also new capabilities for secure,

33
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,240
intelligent and scalable data ecosystems.

34
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:38,970
Moving on the crisis faced by the
enterprises in the current world and

35
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:45,470
also addressing the storage crisis
they're facing how to handle efficiently

36
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,170
with the quantum computing storage.

37
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:55,120
Modern enterprises are phasing and
escalating data storage crisis, right?

38
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,500
Fueled by the as you can see in
the slide with the numbers, the

39
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:05,190
explosion of big data, IOTA and
realtime analytics organizations are

40
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,980
generating petabytes of data daily.

41
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:13,135
Traditional storage architectures
designed for sequential predictable

42
00:03:13,135 --> 00:03:21,004
workloads are increasingly unable to
cope up with the sheer scale velocity

43
00:03:21,364 --> 00:03:23,614
and the complexity of today's data.

44
00:03:24,114 --> 00:03:27,814
Thereby comes the limitations
of traditional storage

45
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:31,474
architectures, such as scalability.

46
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:36,874
The bottlenecks, classical storage
systems scale linearly and as

47
00:03:36,874 --> 00:03:39,244
therefore grows performance degrades.

48
00:03:39,724 --> 00:03:44,534
Adding more storage often
leads to increased latency

49
00:03:44,654 --> 00:03:46,694
and management complexities.

50
00:03:47,534 --> 00:03:50,324
Number two would be
inefficient data retrieval.

51
00:03:50,774 --> 00:03:56,144
Traditional indexing and retrieval
mechanisms struggle with high dimensional,

52
00:03:56,354 --> 00:03:58,304
unstructured, or fragmented data.

53
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:01,384
Number three would be
constant energy consumption.

54
00:04:01,594 --> 00:04:06,844
Maintaining large scale classical
storage requires significant energy

55
00:04:06,934 --> 00:04:09,334
and infrastructure investment.

56
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:14,844
So the quantum storage, the paradigm
shift, we could say, because

57
00:04:14,844 --> 00:04:18,984
this quantum computing offers a
fundamentally different approach to

58
00:04:18,984 --> 00:04:22,079
data storage processing by exploiting.

59
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,289
Quantum states and prob computation.

60
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:30,789
Quantum accelerated storage
systems can address the limitations

61
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:34,629
of classical architectures
through several key innovations.

62
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:35,829
Moving on.

63
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:39,579
Quantum computing the
foundations for storage, right?

64
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:42,169
There are several foundations.

65
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:45,969
So we will go through briefly about
it Now, number one would be quantum

66
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:51,159
machine learning algorithms can
significantly enhance quantum computing

67
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:56,739
foundations for storage by enabling
enabling the intelligent data.

68
00:04:57,354 --> 00:05:00,444
Coding, retrieval,
optimization and management.

69
00:05:00,684 --> 00:05:05,454
These algorithms combine quantum
computing parallelism with machine

70
00:05:05,454 --> 00:05:09,864
learnings, adaptability, helping
create smarter, faster, and

71
00:05:09,864 --> 00:05:11,904
more efficient storage systems.

72
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:17,624
So there are key QML algorithms,
right machine learning algorithms

73
00:05:17,624 --> 00:05:22,244
relevant to quantum story systems
along with how each contributes,

74
00:05:22,904 --> 00:05:25,454
such as quantum K nearest neighbors.

75
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:31,724
Which is qk and N. The purpose of it
is classify or retrieve data points

76
00:05:31,724 --> 00:05:38,444
based on similarity, and the storage
use case would be answers the past

77
00:05:38,444 --> 00:05:43,154
and intelligent retrieval of data
from quantum memory by identifying

78
00:05:43,154 --> 00:05:45,734
the most similar or relevant records.

79
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:50,804
So the advantage would be offers
a potential exponential speed

80
00:05:50,804 --> 00:05:53,144
up in high dimensional space.

81
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:58,619
And the second would be quantum
support Vector machines Q svm.

82
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:04,289
The purpose of is finding the optimal
decision boundaries in the complex data.

83
00:06:04,749 --> 00:06:09,129
The use case would be useful
for categorizing stored data for

84
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:11,624
compression, deduplication, or tiering.

85
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:15,674
As we could say, as an
example, art versus cold data.

86
00:06:16,064 --> 00:06:20,144
So the advantage, the kernel
functions are computed exponentially

87
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:26,074
faster than in classical SVMs,
quantum resistant cryptography.

88
00:06:26,384 --> 00:06:28,124
It can be called a p qc.

89
00:06:28,499 --> 00:06:33,839
These are the frameworks are essential
for securing data in the future where

90
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,479
quantum computers may be capable
of breaking traditional public key

91
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:43,019
crypto systems such as RCDC and ECC.

92
00:06:43,424 --> 00:06:47,234
When designing storage systems,
especially within quantum computing

93
00:06:47,234 --> 00:06:54,989
foundations, this frameworks ensure
confidentiality, even quantum advers.

94
00:06:55,489 --> 00:07:00,529
So we can say as a breakdown of the
main quantum resistant cryptographic

95
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:06,654
frameworks you can consider is for
secure storage systems, lattice based

96
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:12,409
cryptography, code based cryptography,
multi-variable polynomial cryptography.

97
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:15,919
These are the main, mechanisms,
we can use as a framework.

98
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:22,669
Quantum Ling is a specialized
form of quantum computing, right?

99
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:27,419
Designed to solve optimization
problems by leveraging quantum

100
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:29,249
channeling and superposition.

101
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:34,190
While it's traditionally used for general
purpose cryptographic or data storage

102
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:39,200
mechanisms, still it can be applied to
optimized aspects of storage systems

103
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,930
in quantum computing foundations.

104
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,650
And the last would be quantum
classical hybrid systems.

105
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,570
What it is, it's a system where
quantum computing handles parts

106
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:56,320
of a problem that benefit from
superposition and or tunneling.

107
00:07:56,815 --> 00:08:00,295
We can say the examples
as optimization sampling.

108
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:04,765
Classical computing handles IO
control, flow, memory, and tasks

109
00:08:04,975 --> 00:08:06,865
not suitable for quantum processing.

110
00:08:07,165 --> 00:08:11,515
These systems do not store
quantum data directly.

111
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:12,685
That's the beauty of it.

112
00:08:12,685 --> 00:08:17,635
Since quantum memory is not yet scalable,
but we can optimize on secure classical

113
00:08:17,635 --> 00:08:20,935
storage systems using quantum techniques.

114
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:24,280
On what are the different
case studies, right?

115
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,969
In the quantum computing
world to storage systems.

116
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,919
So we go to explore about that.

117
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:38,089
The case studies, the Fortune 500
enterprises are increasingly adopting

118
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:43,429
quantum inspired algorithms to
enhance their storage infrastructures,

119
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:47,749
achieving transformative results
in areas such as optimization,

120
00:08:47,749 --> 00:08:49,579
risk management, and data security.

121
00:08:49,939 --> 00:08:53,410
So we can see some notable
case studies, right?

122
00:08:53,739 --> 00:08:55,569
Logistics, cybersecurity.

123
00:08:56,199 --> 00:09:00,669
So the company has integrated
quantum inspired algorithms within

124
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:06,369
its cloud services to optimize a
logistics and bolster cybersecurity.

125
00:09:06,609 --> 00:09:12,279
By leveraging quantum techniques, company
enhances its recommendation systems and

126
00:09:12,294 --> 00:09:17,954
strengthens data production measures,
ensuring efficient and service operation.

127
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:21,229
Across its vast e-commerce platform.

128
00:09:21,499 --> 00:09:27,469
Then either you're leading car company,
which optimizes the traffic right?

129
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:32,919
Company in collaboration with Microsoft
has utilized quantum inspired algorithms

130
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:37,029
to address traffic congestion by
simulating vehicle movements and

131
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:38,619
optimizing routing strategies.

132
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:44,619
So company achieved a 73% reduction
in congestion and an 8% decrease in

133
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:49,089
overall commuting time, demonstrating
the potential of quantum inspired

134
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,429
methods in real world applications.

135
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:55,229
Then the other leading technology
company, which utilizes.

136
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:57,779
Advancements in the
risk management, right?

137
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:58,799
Using the quantum.

138
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:02,999
So it also partnered with Microsoft
to explore the application of

139
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:06,869
quantum inspired algorithms in risk
management and financial services.

140
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:12,269
By re-imagining the traditional
modeling techniques, the collaboration

141
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:17,854
aims to accelerate performance and
redefined problem solving approaches.

142
00:10:18,344 --> 00:10:22,709
PAing the way for more efficient
risk assessment methodologies.

143
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:27,439
So in a nutshell, these case studies
illustrate how Fortune 500 companies

144
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:31,909
are leveraging the quantum inspired
algorithms to drive innovation and

145
00:10:31,909 --> 00:10:36,979
achieve significant improvements in the
storage and infrastructure operations.

146
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:41,895
Moving on, so the quantum
for storage tiering.

147
00:10:42,395 --> 00:10:46,295
Yeah, it's a tiering is a practice
right in the storage world for

148
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:51,205
organizing data across different
types of storage media categorized

149
00:10:51,205 --> 00:10:54,025
by performance, cost, and durability.

150
00:10:54,235 --> 00:10:59,025
For example, in tier zero NVM
versus CSSD, the cast would be some.

151
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,685
But the performance would be ultra fast.

152
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:06,184
The use case like the catching
streaming realtime data.

153
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:11,074
So there is other category in the
tier one, which offers the example

154
00:11:11,074 --> 00:11:15,814
as SSD which will be fast, but not
like tier zero, which is ultra fast.

155
00:11:16,174 --> 00:11:19,604
But we can use frequently access to files.

156
00:11:20,104 --> 00:11:23,764
And moving on to the tier two storage
systems, where we can see the example

157
00:11:24,034 --> 00:11:28,894
as HDD and the performance would
be a little slower, which can be

158
00:11:28,894 --> 00:11:31,864
ideally used for archives and backups.

159
00:11:32,674 --> 00:11:36,444
And the world has method as we
know every, everyone like tape

160
00:11:36,714 --> 00:11:38,484
storage or cold storage, right?

161
00:11:38,484 --> 00:11:41,294
It's very slow, but for the can be used.

162
00:11:41,474 --> 00:11:43,754
So the challenge assign data object.

163
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,639
Correct tier dynamically and efficiently.

164
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:48,719
Okay.

165
00:11:48,989 --> 00:11:54,839
Now the quantum handling is a method
for finding the global minimum of a

166
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,999
cost function by exploiting quantum
channeling and superposition, it

167
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:04,544
solves the problem formulated as QUBO.

168
00:12:04,964 --> 00:12:11,099
So it's a quadratic, unconstrained,
binary optimization and ING models.

169
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,049
We can use.

170
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:18,569
So these D Wave one similar systems
implement quantum handling for

171
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:20,909
large scale optimization problems.

172
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:26,119
So the goal of quantum handling for
storage tiring is to minimize the

173
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:31,849
overall storage cost and the access
latency by finding the optimal mapping

174
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:33,979
of data blocks to storage tiers.

175
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:38,569
So subject to constraints like
performance requirements, capacity limits.

176
00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:40,919
On optimization.

177
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:42,019
Applied.

178
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:46,339
Basically, it's a quantum enhanced
algorithms to reduce operational,

179
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:51,529
financial, or resource related costs
in more complex systems, particularly

180
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:56,869
those involving large scale data and
high dimensional optimization tasks.

181
00:12:57,369 --> 00:13:02,464
Qml combines quantum computing with
classical machine learning to potentially

182
00:13:02,644 --> 00:13:08,794
outperform classical one approaches
in specific problem domains such as

183
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:13,564
portfolio optimization, supply chain,
cost reduction, energy and storage

184
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:18,514
infrastructure, cost management,
cloud and compute resource allocation.

185
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:20,754
Okay, now comes the question, right?

186
00:13:20,754 --> 00:13:24,354
Why we used to use quantum
learning for cost optimization.

187
00:13:24,854 --> 00:13:28,604
Traditional machine learning or
models are powerful, but often

188
00:13:28,604 --> 00:13:34,334
struggled with combinary complex
spaces, exponential time algorithm,

189
00:13:34,334 --> 00:13:36,224
which is the best example for that.

190
00:13:36,644 --> 00:13:41,084
Optimization under constraints,
spas, or high dimensional data.

191
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:47,099
So quantum algorithms can offer
through quantum parallelism, which is.

192
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:50,569
We are discussing frequently
about the superposition, faster

193
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:56,149
convenience in a certain optimization
scenarios, better sampling example

194
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:58,699
for probabilistic cost estimation.

195
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:04,729
So machine learning combined
with quantum QL is a rescue area.

196
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:06,229
What are the benefits of this?

197
00:14:06,229 --> 00:14:11,569
QL radio reduces time to reach
cost efficient strategies, better

198
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:13,399
modeling of real world systems.

199
00:14:13,774 --> 00:14:17,374
More accurate cost
estimation and forecasting.

200
00:14:17,794 --> 00:14:19,954
These are the three benefits.

201
00:14:20,454 --> 00:14:22,494
Ideally, I could say right on top of the

202
00:14:22,994 --> 00:14:23,654
going on.

203
00:14:23,704 --> 00:14:29,029
What is a quantum resistant
storage, security, quantum computers

204
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:31,189
can break classical encryption.

205
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:36,549
Algorithms, algorithms in the security
of the classical encryption such as

206
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:42,039
RC and EC can be efficiently solved
with short algorithm data stored today

207
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:44,259
might be decrypted in the future.

208
00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:50,739
So stored sensitive data needs protection
that remains secured in a long term.

209
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:55,509
So storage systems need to
adapt to post threats for

210
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:57,849
confidentiality, integrity, and.

211
00:14:58,349 --> 00:15:00,930
Oh, it can be implemented or achieved.

212
00:15:00,979 --> 00:15:04,579
So there comes the post
quantum cryptography.

213
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:05,374
Pqc.

214
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,610
Cryptographic algorithms believed to
resist quantum attacks because they

215
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:15,670
rely on all mathematical problems, not
efficiently solvable by quantum computers.

216
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:22,410
Examples like lattice based examples
such as crystal for encryption crystals

217
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:28,800
s. And the LA as lattice based as a
code based example is multi-variant

218
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,300
polynomial based and ash based signatures.

219
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:37,310
So these are some examples of post
quantum cryptography application, how it

220
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:43,189
can be implemented, encrypt stored data,
authenticate users and device and secure

221
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:45,650
communication between storage nodes.

222
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:48,260
So these are the few
applications, right of Pqc.

223
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:54,580
Quantum safe, random number generation,
so it is one of the security mechanism.

224
00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:01,400
QR entropy, randomness processes
improve key generation quality

225
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,395
and cryptographic strength.

226
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:06,880
The third one would be quantum resistant
authentication and access control.

227
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:11,200
So there are certain protocols
that verify users or device

228
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:16,000
identity without relying on quantum
vulnerable cryptographic methods.

229
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,300
And last would be quantum watermarking.

230
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,900
It's a technique to embed information.

231
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,320
Into data or classical data protected
by quantum resistant methods.

232
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:34,980
It helps data, authenticity, ownership,
and integrity in a way thats both

233
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,500
classical and quantum attacks.

234
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,360
On the quantum classical hybrid framework.

235
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,440
So what is this?

236
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,460
A framework, right?

237
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:47,330
So hybrid system, it's an
integration of quantum processors,

238
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:51,440
as we discussed earlier, QPU and
classical processes, which is CPU,

239
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,440
and collaborative computation.

240
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:58,625
The classical computer controls
prepares inputs four and processes

241
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,415
output from the quantum computer.

242
00:17:01,915 --> 00:17:06,350
Feedback loop classical algorithms,
guide quantum circuits, parameters,

243
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,985
quantum circuits provide evaluation
results to the classical.

244
00:17:10,485 --> 00:17:12,855
So what is a classical interface layer?

245
00:17:12,885 --> 00:17:13,275
Then?

246
00:17:13,755 --> 00:17:16,935
The definition would
be it's a layer, right?

247
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:20,715
Responsible for coordinating
and orchestrating interactions

248
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:24,345
between classical and quantum
parts of your hybrid system.

249
00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:25,990
Then what's the purpose of it?

250
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:27,220
Yeah.

251
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,990
Enable seamless communication,
translating classical instructions

252
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:35,070
into your quantum operations,
and returning quantum measurement

253
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,835
results back to classical algorithms.

254
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:39,855
Then there is another
layer or a framework.

255
00:17:39,855 --> 00:17:41,895
It's a problem translation layer.

256
00:17:41,955 --> 00:17:46,605
It is a layer that takes an abstract
problem or algorithm specifications and

257
00:17:46,605 --> 00:17:50,835
transforms into your quantum computable
representation, such as quantum circuits,

258
00:17:51,675 --> 00:17:56,225
hamiltonians or quadratic unconstrained
binary optimizations formulations, which

259
00:17:56,225 --> 00:17:58,985
we discussed in the last slide, QUBO.

260
00:17:59,485 --> 00:18:03,715
The main purpose of it would be to bridge
the gap between the problem domain and

261
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,385
the Quantum's hardware operational model

262
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,305
and the quantum processing layer.

263
00:18:09,365 --> 00:18:14,030
It is a layer that implements, runs
and management of all these algorithms

264
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:18,030
related to quantum by controlling
quantum hardwares or simulators.

265
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:23,160
So the purpose would be to perform
the quantum part of hybrid algorithms,

266
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:27,960
preparing quantum states, applying
quantum gates, performing measurements,

267
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,270
or running quantum enabling cycles.

268
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,370
And finally comes the integration layer,
the layer the dock states manages and

269
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:39,690
integrates the various software and
hardware components of your hybrid quantum

270
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,050
classical system into your cohesive hold.

271
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:47,810
So the purpose of this integration
layer would be having a seamless

272
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:52,460
interoperability between classical
algorithms, quantum programs, hardware

273
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:58,100
obstruction, and user interfaces,
enabling complex hybrid applications to

274
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,880
run efficiently, fastly, and reliably.

275
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:08,050
So what are the implementation results
right across the industry like healthcare,

276
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,900
financial services, and manufacturing?

277
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,200
So we'll take one, right healthcare.

278
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:19,900
So quantum key distribution, which is
QQED with the quantum resistant storage.

279
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,170
So what is the use case in the
healthcare industry, right?

280
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,720
Secure storage and transmission of.

281
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:29,050
Primarily the electronic
health records, right?

282
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:35,260
The medical records, EHRs, and imaging
data, so it's an ideal use case,

283
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,450
QKD and the quantum watermarking.

284
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:43,150
For medical data integrity, the use case
would be protecting medical images and

285
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:49,270
genomic data from tampering, quantum
inspired storage optimization algorithms.

286
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:56,290
Which managing right massive multimodal
healthcare data sets, genomic sequences,

287
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,270
medical imaging, and patient history.

288
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:02,350
This is one of the wonderful use
case for the storage optimization

289
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,000
algorithms implemented by the quantum.

290
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,540
Then the lastly we could say
securing multi-institution data

291
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,970
sharing via quantum networks.

292
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:18,270
So the use case, like the collaborative
research right across multiple

293
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:22,110
healthcare providers such as hospitals
and universities, we can use the

294
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,610
quantum networks in this case.

295
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,430
Moving on to financial services industry.

296
00:20:27,015 --> 00:20:31,335
We could see 41% reduction in
operation storage expenditures while

297
00:20:31,335 --> 00:20:36,075
processing with the four times more
transactional volumes, maintaining

298
00:20:36,075 --> 00:20:40,425
consistent sub five millisecond
retrieval latency for mission critical

299
00:20:40,425 --> 00:20:45,195
applications such as trading platforms
using quantum enhanced encryption

300
00:20:45,195 --> 00:20:48,255
protocols, the manufacturing industry.

301
00:20:48,755 --> 00:20:53,110
As we know very well improving
supply chain data integrity and

302
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,050
traceability would be the primary
objective in the manufacturing area.

303
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,340
But the challenge is complex.

304
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:03,500
Global supply chains generate
vast amounts of data that must

305
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,300
be accurate and verifiable.

306
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,570
So what is the impact made
by this quantum storage?

307
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:09,635
So this quantums.

308
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:13,495
Verify authenticity and prevent
the tampering of supply chain data.

309
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:18,895
Secure storage of traceability data
supports compliance with quality and

310
00:21:18,895 --> 00:21:24,265
safety standards, so the result is
enhanced trust in supply chain data

311
00:21:24,265 --> 00:21:28,740
integrity, reducing counteract risks,
and ensuring regulatory compliance.

312
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,160
So how can we implementation
perspective, right?

313
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,370
What is a roadmap for
implementing the quantum storage?

314
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,730
So I just segregated into
the different phases.

315
00:21:41,015 --> 00:21:46,345
So the phase one would be the awareness
and strategy where we'll be assessing the

316
00:21:46,345 --> 00:21:51,715
risks and needs, identify the sensitive
data and storage workloads, conduct risk

317
00:21:51,715 --> 00:21:58,020
analysis regarding the quantum threats
such as ours now dec later attacks.

318
00:21:58,415 --> 00:22:00,965
And educate the stakeholders, right?

319
00:22:01,265 --> 00:22:05,825
Train the IT team, security and compliance
teams on quantum computing risks.

320
00:22:06,035 --> 00:22:11,205
Post quantum cryptography, which is pqc
on quantum storage, technical technologies

321
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,335
such as QPD, quantum water marking.

322
00:22:13,575 --> 00:22:14,715
Educate your team.

323
00:22:14,955 --> 00:22:16,245
And defend the objectives.

324
00:22:16,245 --> 00:22:18,255
Clear objectives with the goals.

325
00:22:18,465 --> 00:22:21,765
What are your goals like
improving the data security?

326
00:22:22,035 --> 00:22:25,125
Quantum resistant encryption
comes into play if you were, a

327
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,765
goal is enhance traceability.

328
00:22:28,035 --> 00:22:32,445
Quantum watermarking is there if
the goal is quantum, that means

329
00:22:32,495 --> 00:22:34,265
optimizing the storage efficiency.

330
00:22:34,565 --> 00:22:36,275
Then quantum in algorithms you can.

331
00:22:36,775 --> 00:22:39,705
Phase two would be the
pilot implementation, right?

332
00:22:40,065 --> 00:22:42,735
Such as we can do proof
of concept and planning.

333
00:22:43,105 --> 00:22:47,835
Select one or more pilot areas by
securing the backup encryption using

334
00:22:47,835 --> 00:22:51,705
latest based cryptography, embedding
the quantum watermarks insensitive

335
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:56,355
files using the quantum handling
technique to optimize storage tiering.

336
00:22:57,195 --> 00:22:59,015
So this is about the phase three.

337
00:22:59,515 --> 00:23:01,225
Execution, the evaluation, right?

338
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:05,095
When you complete your proof of
concept, implement the pilot, right?

339
00:23:05,335 --> 00:23:09,715
Encrypt store sample dataset
using an quantum methods.

340
00:23:09,775 --> 00:23:11,485
And test it thoroughly.

341
00:23:11,485 --> 00:23:14,985
Using the performance latency,
throughput, compatibility with

342
00:23:14,985 --> 00:23:18,885
existing systems, security under
simulated threats and measure.

343
00:23:18,885 --> 00:23:24,195
The results have a clear defined
metrics right to evaluate where results.

344
00:23:24,345 --> 00:23:27,885
So results always should be measurable
using the encryption decryption

345
00:23:27,885 --> 00:23:32,775
speed, such as data retrieval,
latency, storage, cost savings.

346
00:23:33,585 --> 00:23:35,655
What are the optimization
use cases we have?

347
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:40,485
And the last phase would be deployment,
the enterprise deployment, right?

348
00:23:40,905 --> 00:23:44,925
In the deployment phase, the
main challenge would be how

349
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:46,525
to scale up the deployment.

350
00:23:46,765 --> 00:23:51,445
So you extend the quantum resistant
storage methods across if you are

351
00:23:51,445 --> 00:23:53,395
using the cloud or on-prem storage.

352
00:23:53,575 --> 00:23:54,175
Extend it.

353
00:23:54,745 --> 00:23:56,305
I value data sets, right?

354
00:23:56,695 --> 00:24:00,150
Such as customer data,
RD data, regulatory data.

355
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:03,440
That's about the roadmap
for the implementation.

356
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:09,860
And yeah, after discussing briefly about
all these quantum storage techniques

357
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,030
and how it can be implemented and what
are the advantages of it, so the key

358
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:18,930
takeaways for the storage computing in
quantum and what would be the next steps.

359
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,920
So it's a strategic response
to the emerging cyber threats.

360
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,990
So quantum resistant encryption
and quantum key distribution are

361
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:32,360
essential to protect sensitive data
from future quantum enabled attacks.

362
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:38,230
And the other key takeaway would
be quantum storage enhances data

363
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:41,310
integrity and the auditability,
quantum watermarking and quantum

364
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,560
secure digital signatures ensure data.

365
00:24:44,145 --> 00:24:48,015
Tamper detection and traceability
critical for compliance.

366
00:24:48,045 --> 00:24:54,394
Trust under digital forensics and quantum
inspired algorithms, optimize the data

367
00:24:54,394 --> 00:24:59,725
infrastructure and also integration
with classical infrastructure is a key

368
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:01,645
practical quantum storage solutions today.

369
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:04,929
Completely, we can say hybrid, right?

370
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:10,179
Blending classical cloud edge storage
with quantum resistant protocols or

371
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:13,419
quantum assisted optimization algorithms.

372
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,189
So standardization of quantum
computing in storage and

373
00:25:17,189 --> 00:25:18,989
readiness are still developing.

374
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:25,065
So NIST is finalizing a post quantum
cryptography, pqc standards, early

375
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:30,795
adoption positions, companies ahead
of regulatory and competitive curves.

376
00:25:31,295 --> 00:25:31,775
Okay.

377
00:25:31,925 --> 00:25:35,795
What would be the next steps for
organizations exploring quantum storage?

378
00:25:36,215 --> 00:25:42,775
Conduct your quantum readiness assessment
pilot quantum resistant encryption.

379
00:25:43,435 --> 00:25:45,745
Collaborate with quantum vendors, right?

380
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:52,905
And platforms engage vendors like p
PQS Shield, I-S-A-R-D-I-B-M, quantum or

381
00:25:52,905 --> 00:25:57,705
Azure Quantum, right to access toolkits
and support, join consortiums like

382
00:25:57,705 --> 00:25:59,985
Quantum Economic Development Consortium.

383
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:05,885
We would say QED dash CE tsi,
quantum Monitor standardization on

384
00:26:05,885 --> 00:26:10,535
policy development, train security,
and IT teams design a roadmap.

385
00:26:11,495 --> 00:26:13,205
For scaled implementation, right?

386
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:18,485
Start with the low risk pilot projects
such as archival storage, backups.

387
00:26:18,665 --> 00:26:19,025
Yeah.

388
00:26:19,085 --> 00:26:20,345
These are the low risk, right?

389
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:22,595
For any project or at
the enterprise level.

390
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:23,375
Start with it.

391
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:26,645
Then plan for enterprise wide rollout.

392
00:26:26,705 --> 00:26:30,455
If you are successful with the pilot
projects right at the low level

393
00:26:30,815 --> 00:26:36,245
you can make a wide rollout at the
organization with quantum safe encryption.

394
00:26:36,785 --> 00:26:41,435
Security key management and
hybrid optimization workflows.

395
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:42,805
Yeah, that's it.

396
00:26:43,055 --> 00:26:46,985
Thanks for the opportunity to discuss
about the different techniques,

397
00:26:46,985 --> 00:26:50,375
frameworks about the quantum
computing in the storage systems.

398
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:52,535
Thanks for all for your time.

399
00:26:53,035 --> 00:26:53,625
Thank you.

400
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:54,625
Bye.
