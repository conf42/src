00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,460
Hi guys, my name is Han.

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:05,640
Today we are gonna talk
about the prompt engineering.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,760
This is one of the most
demanding skills for this ticket.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,615
So let's start what we have today.

5
00:00:12,115 --> 00:00:15,945
Okay, so today we are gonna talk about
what is the prompt, what is the prompt

6
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:20,305
engineering, how to write a good prompt
what is the technique we can use?

7
00:00:20,695 --> 00:00:25,005
How to, how this prompt is evolved
and where what is a trend for

8
00:00:25,005 --> 00:00:26,505
emerging trend for the prompt?

9
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:27,225
Okay?

10
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:30,375
And we'll see some of the cases,
studies as well as ethics and

11
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,025
responsibility of AI practice.

12
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:35,445
We are going to cover everything
in this today's presentation.

13
00:00:36,405 --> 00:00:37,515
So let's start guys.

14
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,280
What is the prompt engineering?

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,180
So prompt engineering, basically I
use user give the inputs provided the

16
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:49,410
requirement, prompt, document that or
structure that instructions and provide

17
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,710
this detail to the a, a l process,
the data and generate the output based

18
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,350
on the instruction of provided by the
prompt and you will get the result.

19
00:00:57,635 --> 00:00:59,015
Based on the instruction you've given.

20
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:02,395
So that is in simple way we can
say it's a prompt engineering Now.

21
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,430
What, let's understand more
about the prompt engineering.

22
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,940
Prompt engineering is not only
the art, it's art and science to

23
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,440
generate your desired results.

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,390
Why we call art, because it give you
the desired results and why we call

25
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,350
it science, because if you have to
have, provide the clear cut instruction

26
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:23,700
structure and context of background
behind that, we have to remember one thing

27
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,490
better, the input and better the quality.

28
00:01:27,015 --> 00:01:30,035
Otherwise you'll not get a good
response if do not have the good.

29
00:01:30,035 --> 00:01:30,515
Prompt.

30
00:01:31,505 --> 00:01:31,895
Prompt.

31
00:01:31,895 --> 00:01:36,565
Can be, prompt, can be for in any form,
text, visual and audios can be provided.

32
00:01:36,565 --> 00:01:38,245
The input can be provided in any form.

33
00:01:38,245 --> 00:01:38,455
Okay.

34
00:01:38,455 --> 00:01:39,655
Visual, audio and codes.

35
00:01:39,985 --> 00:01:42,895
So let's see how this
prompt engineering works.

36
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:45,875
So we have to understand the
concept for the prompt engineering.

37
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:48,425
But before we go and talk about
more about the prompt engineering,

38
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:52,205
we need to understand what is the
LLM Large language model, which is.

39
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:54,445
The heart and key of the this one.

40
00:01:54,445 --> 00:01:58,045
So next couple of slides, we are going
to see how this prompt has evolved and

41
00:01:58,045 --> 00:02:00,120
we're gonna talk about the LLM as well.

42
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,030
So let's see how the
prompt has evolved in 2020.

43
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,320
There was a keyword prompt.

44
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,820
There, is there, sorry,
there is a keyword prompt.

45
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,570
We just give the inputs
through the prompts and just

46
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,800
hope for the best results.

47
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:12,640
Okay.

48
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,620
Then we see the then we see the 20,
21, 22, a few short examples or come.

49
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,710
So it means like you provided some
of the example template to the.

50
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:24,695
To the AI or prom based on that example.

51
00:02:24,695 --> 00:02:26,165
In template, it'll generate the response.

52
00:02:26,795 --> 00:02:31,035
Then the role based or chain of thoughts
has been evolved in 20 23, 20 24.

53
00:02:31,395 --> 00:02:36,730
So AI can be act as a role act, act
as a plays a role or persona act as

54
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:41,030
a analyst, act as a manager, and and
can provide the response accordingly.

55
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,550
Then it's further announcement has
happened, the chain of thought,

56
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,340
thinking about the logical
step-by-step process, and it'll

57
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,005
provide you the, provide the outputs.

58
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:53,435
And then multimodal prompts where we talk
about the the text, audio and different

59
00:02:53,435 --> 00:02:55,535
types of, can be considered as an input.

60
00:02:55,985 --> 00:02:59,485
This oral, we are gonna discuss
in next couple of, next couple

61
00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:02,175
of slides where we are gonna talk
more in detail about that one.

62
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:05,055
This is the, just a history
of how the prompt is evolved.

63
00:03:05,505 --> 00:03:09,135
Okay, now let's go and talk about
LLL as we discussed earlier.

64
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:14,565
Large language model, it's basically,
basically the data which can be provided

65
00:03:14,565 --> 00:03:16,515
in any form, text, images, speech.

66
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:18,525
The large set of data has been pointed.

67
00:03:18,895 --> 00:03:22,345
Provided, and it's been
trained, this clean data will be

68
00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:23,665
stored in the vector database.

69
00:03:23,675 --> 00:03:26,575
This is typically is the function
of the large language model.

70
00:03:26,935 --> 00:03:31,895
So large language model is the source
for your AI to generate the data.

71
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:36,810
This is what the this is, this is the
feature of the ai, which can be develop,

72
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,570
developed through the deep learning
method we are using to develop the AI

73
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,850
and develop this large language model.

74
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,580
And which, if we are going,
which is used frequently used

75
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,990
by for the prompt engineering.

76
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,020
For the prompt, let's
seek couple of examples.

77
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,710
Are there, okay.

78
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,520
Like we all knows about, or most of
the works are using the chat g, pt, and

79
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,800
other AI based prompt engineering tools.

80
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,990
So chat, GPT is also used.

81
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,470
The LLM large language model.

82
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,440
It is a 2.5 trillion parameter,
used two huge dataset to perform the

83
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,360
different multiple types of functions.

84
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,620
Similarly, the bot, it's
another one LLM model.

85
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,210
For prompt engineering, it used
the three 40 millions of parameter

86
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,920
to provide the desired results.

87
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,730
So Google, Germany is another one example,
which is developed by the Google mine.

88
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,080
This all are the.

89
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,270
All of the example of the state
of the art will provide you the

90
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,300
very good, accurate results based
on the LLM has been developed.

91
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,760
So now let's go further.

92
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,100
There was one case study was AI
powered Financial Reporting Chatbot.

93
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,240
So have author one of the article AI
Reporting Financial Chatbot, which you

94
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,160
can find out on as per the below link.

95
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,005
So we have implemented this
for our clients or customers.

96
00:04:48,275 --> 00:04:52,355
So after implementing, we see
the 65% productivity key in 94.

97
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:58,280
94% of reporting accuracy and the
significant faster performance we saw.

98
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,280
When you have time, let's go
through this article and read it.

99
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,990
You will get more insight
about the article.

100
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,690
Now, what is a prompt?

101
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,720
We need to understand the prompt before
we talk about the prompt engineering more.

102
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,810
The prompt is nothing but
it just a call of action.

103
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,770
Call to action.

104
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:17,210
What is a call to action is you tell to
the AI how what to do, how to do, and

105
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,460
sometimes we need, say what to avoid.

106
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:22,355
To get the desired output,
that is called a prompt.

107
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,525
So prompt engineering, why
the prompt engineer matters.

108
00:05:25,915 --> 00:05:31,115
The nowadays the AI is used by or
prompt ai, use AI and prompt and

109
00:05:31,115 --> 00:05:35,025
used by almost in all the sectors,
especially the, when you have to write

110
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:40,755
a good detail or documents or research,
paper, law, healthcare, business, or.

111
00:05:41,245 --> 00:05:42,655
Significantly using this one.

112
00:05:42,655 --> 00:05:46,475
But we have to remember, in order to
get to write a good good documents

113
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:50,505
and document, we should have, the
good LLM or large language model

114
00:05:50,575 --> 00:05:52,595
has to be developed accordingly.

115
00:05:53,135 --> 00:05:56,280
So good data input will
give you the good results.

116
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,420
Okay, so better input
is the better output.

117
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,790
Not only the, so we have to
see the quality of the prompt.

118
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,560
Good quality prompt will
give the good results.

119
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,630
Bad quality prompt will
not give the good results.

120
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:10,630
It'll give you the give the bias
information and it'll waste your time.

121
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,020
This one, so we have to focus we'll see
some of the examples in the see how the

122
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,630
good and back prompt will impact the work.

123
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:23,080
Okay, so this is what you have to
remember this to talking to when you're

124
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,520
talking about the prompt engineering.

125
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,460
You have to remember when you
like how to talk to the ai.

126
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,760
So the language is, it is
called a prompt engineering.

127
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,830
It is the prompt, the language
which you're using effectively

128
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,150
communicating to the ai.

129
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,460
So let's see.

130
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,340
Why effective prompts are important.

131
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,480
Effective prompts is important because
if without the effective prompt

132
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,420
there is it'll directly influence
your quality with the AI response.

133
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,670
If you do not have the good prompt,
you're not get good response.

134
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,610
Crafted prompt will give you the
desired results what you're looking for.

135
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,340
That one, that is why the
importance of the prompt is there.

136
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,730
Now, let's see some of the examples.

137
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,130
Good versus bad prompt.

138
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:06,100
You can see here if you go and
just give the instruction, explain

139
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,760
the ai, help ai, so it is a very
weak the scope is very high.

140
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,070
You'll not get the results,
you'll get a very generic

141
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,299
results or output of this one.

142
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:18,739
But in order to give us a good
instruction to the prompt, okay, you,

143
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:23,780
if you mention explain AI in a hundred
words using the simple language, it is

144
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,839
a, it'll give you the desired results
and with the specific limitation.

145
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:30,269
So this is one of the
example and another example.

146
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:32,299
If you say, tell me
about the cybersecurity.

147
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:33,799
This is again, a little bit weak.

148
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:36,769
You're not talking, you're not specific
because cybersecurity could be the

149
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:38,149
plenty of information available.

150
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:39,709
What you're looking is not very clear.

151
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:43,669
But if you want to make it the good
prompt, you can say, list of three, common

152
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:49,179
cybersecurity threat, or explain how this
micro Microsoft defender mitigate them.

153
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,604
Similarly, you can ask like.

154
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:53,010
Prompt, if I can you
write the email for me.

155
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:53,789
It's very generic.

156
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:57,900
But if you ask them to play the
role or act as a project manager and

157
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,919
draft the email repetitive response
based on the highlighted uncertain

158
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,959
points, you'll get a better results.

159
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,069
So these are the example purpose of
this example to show to all of you.

160
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:12,979
Prompt see how you will give the
input or instruction based on that.

161
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:14,119
You'll get the response.

162
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,145
So we have to learn about how do
you need to provide the provide the

163
00:08:18,645 --> 00:08:20,905
the prompt or details to the ai.

164
00:08:21,055 --> 00:08:22,945
So in order to get the good results.

165
00:08:23,425 --> 00:08:24,595
So let's check it.

166
00:08:24,595 --> 00:08:24,925
See.

167
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:29,585
So the best way to to give the input
to this one, you should remember this.

168
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:30,495
Four points.

169
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:30,825
Okay.

170
00:08:31,155 --> 00:08:34,665
So we should provide the context or
the background of the work, of work,

171
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:38,615
what background, what you're doing
context to the ai, and then the provide

172
00:08:38,615 --> 00:08:40,595
the task information, what you want.

173
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:45,125
AI or prompt has to respond back to you
and then provide the constant what are

174
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:49,185
the limitations are there If you have
limitations so that you should provide.

175
00:08:49,185 --> 00:08:52,365
And similarly, to provide any additional
information which you want to do.

176
00:08:52,635 --> 00:08:54,855
See here the, one of the
example is highlighted here.

177
00:08:55,355 --> 00:08:59,015
The marketing manager like suppose, okay,
so you are the marketing manager for the

178
00:08:59,015 --> 00:09:01,295
few new product launch in FMCG sector.

179
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:04,245
This example is talking about
you are providing the background

180
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:07,245
about the marketing manager
belongs to the certain sector.

181
00:09:07,485 --> 00:09:10,885
So this will give us a will help
us move to get a good results.

182
00:09:11,185 --> 00:09:12,265
Similarly, we.

183
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:17,075
To perform that good ta we AI to
perform the task more efficiently.

184
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:20,585
So now the example is written here,
the right is short paragraph that

185
00:09:20,585 --> 00:09:24,905
describe the target audience for the
product and the key marketing messages

186
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:26,135
that will be resonate with them.

187
00:09:26,885 --> 00:09:29,705
So this is the task, what
you've given after providing.

188
00:09:29,925 --> 00:09:31,345
The background and the task.

189
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,165
You give it with the example, and then
you're putting the constant on that one.

190
00:09:34,435 --> 00:09:37,645
The response should not be more than one
50 character and should be focused on

191
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:39,445
the most important marketing messages.

192
00:09:39,775 --> 00:09:42,505
So now you're limiting and
providing the constant one 50 words

193
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:44,605
and focus on the certain areas.

194
00:09:45,205 --> 00:09:49,045
And then additional information like
the product is washing liquid for

195
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:52,225
the washing machine, targeted for
the urban and semi-urban households.

196
00:09:52,555 --> 00:09:57,125
So with the help of this type of
structure once you provide to the prompt,

197
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,410
you'll get a very accurate answer.

198
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:03,160
So keep in mind this formula, the
context towers, constant extend function.

199
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,640
This is very helpful to provide
the structure, form detail to get

200
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,470
a better results from the prompt.

201
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:09,260
Okay.

202
00:10:09,795 --> 00:10:13,655
You can remember a few of the works for
the prompt engineer, which will help

203
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,725
us to give us a more accurate results.

204
00:10:15,755 --> 00:10:18,935
Like Act S you can, this
is a persona pattern, okay?

205
00:10:18,935 --> 00:10:24,865
So where you can ask LLM or ask AI to be,
act as a manager, analyst, specialist.

206
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:26,455
So we'll give you the better result.

207
00:10:26,815 --> 00:10:29,365
When you say ask for the analysis,
he'll provide you the more

208
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:31,535
detailed analysis of the certain.

209
00:10:31,745 --> 00:10:35,595
Certain detail which you're looking
for, this specific field summarize

210
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:38,445
when you asked to summarize
today, I use this word summarize.

211
00:10:38,445 --> 00:10:41,255
So then here to summarize for
you in the way you're looking for

212
00:10:41,255 --> 00:10:46,115
multiple information in in the
summary statement, the way you want.

213
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:48,335
So use this word, this
words are very helpful.

214
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,290
Generate.

215
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,540
So it'll generate the output, the
way you're looking, the based on

216
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,850
the ideas or the details it's given.

217
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,990
So it generate the new ideas as,
as well as the concept for you.

218
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,020
So use this so it'll help you predict.

219
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,290
So based on the current place,
the data level, he will predict.

220
00:11:05,435 --> 00:11:06,595
Or train for you.

221
00:11:06,745 --> 00:11:10,295
So you can use this word, this, these
are the words which will help you to give

222
00:11:10,385 --> 00:11:12,605
a more record results, elaborate more.

223
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:16,385
So you can have asked to AI to
elaborate more in simple language.

224
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:20,025
So on particular topic, on particular
point, on a specific specific area.

225
00:11:20,265 --> 00:11:23,295
So it'll help you to give
us a desired results simply.

226
00:11:23,295 --> 00:11:26,325
And the last one is nothing but
more than like simply simplify.

227
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:28,875
So it can provide the result
in the simple language so

228
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,455
everyone can understand easily.

229
00:11:30,455 --> 00:11:31,360
So these are the power works.

230
00:11:31,715 --> 00:11:36,065
Along with what we saw, how to write
a prompt along with this power box, if

231
00:11:36,065 --> 00:11:39,095
you can use that will be very helpful
for you to get the good results.

232
00:11:39,595 --> 00:11:41,425
So now let's go to the next one.

233
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,765
So there are core, prompt techniques.

234
00:11:44,595 --> 00:11:48,135
There, there are many techniques which
can be used to get the better results.

235
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:50,715
There are a few techniques are
listed here, like role prompting

236
00:11:50,715 --> 00:11:51,885
as we already talked about.

237
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:57,425
We can ask AI to be act as a pm
act as a lawyer, act as analyst.

238
00:11:57,665 --> 00:11:59,760
So these are the few examples there.

239
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,750
Role-based prompting.

240
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,500
So can we play the role and give
the good results chain of thought.

241
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,110
It's a step by step process
the way human think.

242
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:10,410
You can provide the instruction and
you can expect that result as per the.

243
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,140
As per the instruction given, so it
can solve your complex problem, I

244
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,950
think with the step by step process.

245
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,650
So you should know how to
instruct to the prompt.

246
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,820
So this is the chain of thought.

247
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,440
We can use the technique to get the better
results You could have multiple time.

248
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,870
You need to give the instruction
like step by step process.

249
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,450
First time you give certain instruction
based on the output, you will go

250
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,880
the second set of instruction.

251
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,050
Then third set of mention.

252
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,940
I will give you the good
results based on that one.

253
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:40,930
All together come by few short is just
another one case where you can provide

254
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:46,100
the example based on the example, AI or
prompt will return you the the response.

255
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,370
Zero short nothing but just a
straightforward just to provide the

256
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,460
instruction based on the instruction
able will like a response back to you.

257
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,620
So these are the core pro technique.

258
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,015
Which you can use for to get
a, get the better results.

259
00:12:59,015 --> 00:13:00,365
So we see so far the three way.

260
00:13:00,365 --> 00:13:00,575
Okay.

261
00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:03,825
You can use the provide the
context, background information,

262
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,085
more details to them, okay?

263
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:08,425
And we can use the the power ws
as well as we can use this prompt

264
00:13:08,425 --> 00:13:10,665
technique to get the good results Now.

265
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,580
The prompt quality.

266
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:12,940
Okay.

267
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,550
When we are talking about the prompt
quality, we have to remember one

268
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,540
thing garbage in, garbage out.

269
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,600
So good prompt will give the good results.

270
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,430
Bad prompt will give the bad results.

271
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,120
Before, before we like what, for
what is the best way to provide

272
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,990
the details to the prompt.

273
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,310
Keep in mind the goal and audience first.

274
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:30,910
Okay?

275
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,300
Keep it.

276
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,910
And then accordingly, you can provide the
information, provide the more background

277
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,560
and data point as much as possible as
a part of the format, what we talked

278
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,730
about, background context, this one,
and to how to mention very specifically,

279
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,380
you need the desire in which format.

280
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,650
You need the bullet points
summary, PPT or Word document.

281
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,935
They, the AI will be
generate all this for you.

282
00:13:50,435 --> 00:13:52,790
Add the restriction because
you're not adding the restriction.

283
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,720
It'll be the open in it.

284
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,490
Either the length.

285
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:55,500
Okay.

286
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,010
Tone, perspective or any other thing,
which you are looking a specific

287
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,830
thing from as a part of your response.

288
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,420
So these are some of the points
which you need to be which you

289
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,160
want to make sure you are using.

290
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,040
This, keep in mind this
point for using the prompt.

291
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:09,850
Okay.

292
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,330
For accuracy to avoid any biasness.

293
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,530
No.

294
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,290
We talked about prompt.

295
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,070
We see how to write the prompt, but if
you, we see some of the good example, good

296
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,540
and bad example, how to write the prompt.

297
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,410
So there is success story based
on the prompt engineering after

298
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,670
evolving of the prompt engineering.

299
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,740
There are a few example,
I'm, we are gonna talk today.

300
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,050
There are plenty of them
are available if you to.

301
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:33,465
Go and search through the AI
or go in Google, you'll find

302
00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:34,905
so many examples as there.

303
00:14:35,325 --> 00:14:39,075
One of the, one of the examples of most
of the customer support or fortune fin

304
00:14:39,075 --> 00:14:44,795
aid companies using the AI assistance
or chat bot for chat bot and a other AI

305
00:14:45,035 --> 00:14:48,935
for ticket resolution, we see the 14%
increase on their average resolution.

306
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:54,845
Similarly, the MIT able to with the
help of structure form, they're able

307
00:14:54,845 --> 00:14:59,585
to produce the better research articles
and documents, so the quality is

308
00:14:59,585 --> 00:15:01,235
significantly improved and save the time.

309
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:01,625
Also.

310
00:15:02,405 --> 00:15:08,145
Similarly the PCG has like b, c, G
mentioned, like even the non-technical

311
00:15:08,145 --> 00:15:11,405
people can solve the complex
problem with, because of the prompt

312
00:15:11,405 --> 00:15:13,695
engineering is available because of
the prompt, good prompt is available.

313
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,940
So this is another one cases there.

314
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:16,210
Okay.

315
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:21,330
And we see the McKensey has developed the
product library, which can help us to go

316
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,400
code receptor and identify the root cause.

317
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,040
It saves significant time
as well as money for them.

318
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,020
So these are the few
success stories out there.

319
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,220
Many more could be there.

320
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,080
This is the like, how to use the prompt.

321
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,870
So you will, you really get
a good results of the prompt.

322
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,600
Now let's review some
of the story, which is.

323
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,790
The failure cases.

324
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:43,360
So as I mentioned earlier, okay,
the garbage in, garbage out.

325
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:47,740
If you do not have the good LLM okay,
and you do not have the the good LLM,

326
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,440
then you'll not get a disaster if
you don't know how to use the prompt.

327
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,510
Also, in that case also the, it
could be the case of failure.

328
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,050
So one of the airline, chatbot,
give the example like, give the

329
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,590
misleading information to the customer
and the lawsuit has been filed and

330
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,340
the airline paid the huge penalty.

331
00:16:02,515 --> 00:16:05,355
This is one of the information
we are using the the chat bot,

332
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,655
because might be the chat bot
given the misleading information.

333
00:16:08,655 --> 00:16:09,825
It's not trained properly.

334
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:11,865
With the LLM, this is one of the example.

335
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:16,120
The another one, the sensitive data leak
example is happened where someone is.

336
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:20,965
Accidentally share the code
to code confidential code with

337
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:25,395
the, with open AI or with the
with the prompting engineering.

338
00:16:25,455 --> 00:16:25,845
Okay.

339
00:16:26,295 --> 00:16:28,315
So that become the issue.

340
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:32,425
And then later on the organization, block
the chat GP within their own organization.

341
00:16:33,265 --> 00:16:36,265
One of the, one of the very, very
interesting case with the terms

342
00:16:36,265 --> 00:16:41,005
of service agreement has been,
updated by by by automated ai

343
00:16:41,065 --> 00:16:42,415
and they have mentioned on that.

344
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,370
The the chatting and other information,
customer information can be used to

345
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,130
train to the AI without their concern.

346
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,700
Consent.

347
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,250
So this has, again, become a big issue.

348
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,160
It was came in the news also.

349
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,000
Article.

350
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,060
So then later on they have
automation corrected, that problem.

351
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,195
The one, another one thing
the, if you're using the AI to,

352
00:17:03,675 --> 00:17:05,625
for like example for hiring.

353
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:05,835
Okay.

354
00:17:05,835 --> 00:17:09,900
So one of the case, what happen
in hiring the the AI will.

355
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,760
Was a bias and providing the
information based on the age insects.

356
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:15,240
Okay?

357
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,010
And that could create the issue.

358
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,960
So later on, this has been blocked
by the Ian who are using that ai.

359
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,705
So this one, so you to remember
when we are getting the.

360
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,375
The benefit of the AI that we
could have the issues, also the ai.

361
00:17:28,405 --> 00:17:31,735
So how to use, what
process we need to use.

362
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:33,475
What is the ethical way of working?

363
00:17:33,925 --> 00:17:36,265
How to write the prompt
to get the good results.

364
00:17:36,775 --> 00:17:39,535
We have to make sure every time
we need to validate that results.

365
00:17:39,565 --> 00:17:43,525
Since you see some of the cases of failure
and success, and we earlier saw some

366
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:45,025
of his example of good and bad prompt.

367
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:47,005
This could be the cause of
the success and failure.

368
00:17:47,455 --> 00:17:48,775
Now let's go and see.

369
00:17:49,275 --> 00:17:53,215
So we so far we talked about lots of
things about the prompt, how to write

370
00:17:53,275 --> 00:17:57,325
now, how to write the prompt and now
see looks, how, where the trend is going

371
00:17:57,325 --> 00:17:59,095
now, future trend we are talking about.

372
00:17:59,815 --> 00:18:00,325
So ums.

373
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:05,095
Like we need to, like in the next,
next 24, next three, four year,

374
00:18:05,095 --> 00:18:07,855
you will see the more governance
will be coming to the picture.

375
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:11,375
Talking about the more about the
standard audit more audit is going

376
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,225
to happen because it, AI can be used.

377
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,200
According to governance and audit
has to be happened to make sure the

378
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,870
accuracy of the AI to avoid any issues.

379
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,730
AI going to further going to use,
like that's a multi-agent going

380
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,690
to closely going to work with the
copilot that is q See it's in, it's.

381
00:18:29,955 --> 00:18:31,815
It's, we'll see in the next 20.

382
00:18:32,655 --> 00:18:36,255
You only going to see in the next four
to five year it's going to more, you'll

383
00:18:36,255 --> 00:18:38,535
see the progress on that one multi-model.

384
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,305
We already using text, images, and audio.

385
00:18:40,305 --> 00:18:44,355
Now you'll see the started combination
of that one be it's coming in the future.

386
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:45,105
Ai so.

387
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:49,965
Can be given the instruction on multiple
modes together and get the response in

388
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:54,345
a different way, the way you're looking
and the most important dynamic learning.

389
00:18:54,345 --> 00:18:59,685
So it can be, AI can be learned as
on the fly adoption that you see

390
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:02,265
this changes is going to happen
in the next three to four years.

391
00:19:03,015 --> 00:19:03,825
This is the trend.

392
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:07,995
Now let's take a pause here and
because we talked a lot about the

393
00:19:07,995 --> 00:19:09,645
prompt, so what we covered so far.

394
00:19:09,645 --> 00:19:09,945
Okay.

395
00:19:09,975 --> 00:19:11,865
We talked about what is
a prompt engineering.

396
00:19:11,895 --> 00:19:15,285
We talked about what is a prompt,
how to write the quality prompt.

397
00:19:15,475 --> 00:19:18,725
We talked about provide the good
detailed background context.

398
00:19:18,785 --> 00:19:19,325
This one.

399
00:19:19,735 --> 00:19:20,815
Pick the pick.

400
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,080
We can.

401
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,950
Use a different technique.

402
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:27,300
We talked about like chain of thoughts,
prompt and other techniques can be

403
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,210
used for writing the good prompt, what
tool and framework we need to use.

404
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,870
And and most important thing about
this one, the ethical part, which we're

405
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,770
going to cover in the next couple of
slides, like how to, what could be the

406
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:44,780
how do we need to work and how do we
human need to validate all these ones?

407
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,820
So these were the, so
far, the key takeaway.

408
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,810
Let's go forward.

409
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:50,765
So ethical, we are working,
so we have to remember.

410
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,450
AI will give you the lots of input.

411
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,950
So you should be transparent
with your client customer or

412
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,210
anyone whom you're working.

413
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:03,020
If it is if it is ai, AI contributed
work, you need to mention

414
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,790
clearly it is AI generated work.

415
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,490
It could be edited by
you after generation.

416
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:11,200
Taking the help from the AI is
not a bad thing, but you should

417
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,580
be transparent about that one.

418
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,630
Communicate accordingly.

419
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,620
Avoid claiming the AI genetic
content belongs to you.

420
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,140
Clear.

421
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,340
Please make it big.

422
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:19,910
Be clear.

423
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:20,480
Okay.

424
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,630
And to your client, customer, or anyone?

425
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,210
Like it is the age united contract.

426
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:28,210
So you can, you, it should be good
for everyone if you mention this one.

427
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,710
So we talked about this one and.

428
00:20:31,225 --> 00:20:35,625
We should not use the unbiased
wording while writing to the prompt,

429
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,065
because that's very important.

430
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:42,725
This is the basic ethics we have to
follow while using the prompt for for ai.

431
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:47,600
So we should, we all are responsible
for following the ethics and develop

432
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,105
the good community to how to use the ai.

433
00:20:50,605 --> 00:20:50,845
Okay.

434
00:20:50,845 --> 00:20:51,715
Now let's see.

435
00:20:52,315 --> 00:20:53,455
Governance and safety.

436
00:20:53,455 --> 00:20:56,175
We already talked a little bit about
in the previous slide about the

437
00:20:56,175 --> 00:20:57,885
government governance and safety.

438
00:20:57,885 --> 00:21:00,375
We have to be very clear
about how to handle the data.

439
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:04,645
So some or and retention policy that has
to be defined very clearly within the

440
00:21:04,645 --> 00:21:06,505
organization as well as outside work.

441
00:21:06,505 --> 00:21:08,155
So we should have rules
and regulations should win.

442
00:21:08,155 --> 00:21:10,825
Place to avoid the misses of the policy.

443
00:21:11,665 --> 00:21:14,755
Train your team or train
your peers colleague.

444
00:21:15,185 --> 00:21:19,025
On other members who is using
this one ethical way of working.

445
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:19,205
Okay.

446
00:21:19,205 --> 00:21:22,535
And make them responsible for the
good, using the prompt accordingly.

447
00:21:23,035 --> 00:21:27,955
So output, AI generated output,
it's, and make sure you are verifying

448
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:28,705
that AI generated output it.

449
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,665
Can be a bias based on the LLM is there.

450
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:34,215
If you not human need
to verify that output.

451
00:21:34,215 --> 00:21:37,995
Otherwise it'll be, so we have
to make sure all the AI generated

452
00:21:38,325 --> 00:21:40,900
content has to be verified by human.

453
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,630
So you have to crosscheck with this one.

454
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:47,280
So this is what the most
important thing for the governance

455
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,510
and safety point of view.

456
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,440
Now, the, all the data presented in this.

457
00:21:52,755 --> 00:21:57,655
Presentation are you can see the reference
and data sources are available here.

458
00:21:57,705 --> 00:22:02,295
So it's all the data we are presented from
the certified places we pull the data.

459
00:22:02,295 --> 00:22:03,850
So it's talking about that.

460
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:08,670
Now I want like when to talk
more about what, how the prompt

461
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,200
engineering impacting your work.

462
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:10,470
Okay.

463
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,760
Or your current workflow.

464
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,150
Okay.

465
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,960
How your what is your experience
about the prompt engineering?

466
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,090
We'll talk about some time and we'll take
some of the question about HL policy and

467
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,630
what should be the perfect prompt for you
and how is your experience about this one?

468
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,160
So let's talk sometime during our meeting.

469
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,190
We'll more deep dive about this one.

470
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,220
So look like I have covered
most of the stuff here.

471
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,090
I think so.

472
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,290
We are good for now.

473
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,840
If you have any question,
please post the message to me.

474
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,590
We'll try to answer that question.

475
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:37,990
Thanks for joining.

476
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:38,800
Thanks everyone.

477
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,400
Thank you guys.
