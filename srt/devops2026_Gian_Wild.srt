1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,370
Speaker 51: Hi, my name's Gian
Wild and I'm here to speak about

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,340
how security and accessibility can
be friends at Comp 42 DevOps 2026.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm coming to you from Australia, and
firstly, I would like to acknowledge

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,890
the Gro people as the traditional owners
of this land who still have a strong

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,620
attachment to the land I'm currently on.

6
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:30,810
This presentation can be accessed
at the accessibility OZ conferences

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:38,790
page, which is at www do accessibility
oz.com/about/conferences.

8
00:00:40,185 --> 00:00:44,265
If you go to the accessibility
OZ website, you can see the about

9
00:00:44,265 --> 00:00:48,735
section at the top here, select
about, and then select conferences.

10
00:00:48,825 --> 00:00:53,175
You can see that I have an upcoming
conference, which is Comp 42 DevOps.

11
00:00:53,445 --> 00:00:56,625
That will be moved to under
past conferences and events,

12
00:00:56,895 --> 00:01:00,045
and you can access all the
information that I talk about here.

13
00:01:01,425 --> 00:01:07,095
This is a photo of our team at
CSUN in 2018, which is, wow, eight

14
00:01:07,095 --> 00:01:10,065
years ago now, which is kind of
terrifying if you think about it.

15
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:14,685
This is about two thirds of my team,
and one of the things that I wanted

16
00:01:14,685 --> 00:01:19,335
to do when I started accessibility
Oz is I wanted support people by

17
00:01:19,335 --> 00:01:24,195
employing people with disabilities, as
well as of course, making accessible

18
00:01:24,195 --> 00:01:26,205
websites and doing accessible testing.

19
00:01:26,595 --> 00:01:26,835
So.

20
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,850
Over the last 15 years, almost 15
years that we've been operating, we've

21
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,370
never had under less than 60% of our
staff having some kind of significant

22
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,380
disability that affects their daily life.

23
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,160
And if you have a look at us, we
all look quote unquote normal.

24
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,090
And that's important to realize
that people with disabilities

25
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,980
are often hidden in plain sight.

26
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,440
You won't know if
someone has a disability.

27
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,460
Please don't ask.

28
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,750
It's very rude.

29
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,400
Now, over the, as I said, almost 15
years that we've been operating, we've

30
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,140
had staff with dyslexia, moderate
vision impairment, severe vision

31
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,780
impairment, epilepsy, migraines.

32
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,870
Physical impairment, fibromyalgia,
multiple sclerosis, Crohn's

33
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,100
disease, post-traumatic stress
disorder, autism, and long COVID.

34
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,230
I myself have long COVID, which
uh, has definitely put a pin in

35
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:26,060
my traveling to conferences, but I
still try and participate as I can.

36
00:02:26,785 --> 00:02:30,774
Another thing to realize is that it's
not just about vision impairments.

37
00:02:30,954 --> 00:02:34,825
A lot of people, especially if they're
new to accessibility, talk only

38
00:02:34,825 --> 00:02:36,745
about screen reader accessibility.

39
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:39,984
That's, uh, absolutely
important and essential.

40
00:02:40,225 --> 00:02:44,424
But the largest group of people with
disabilities who use the web are actually

41
00:02:44,424 --> 00:02:46,135
people with cognitive disabilities.

42
00:02:46,345 --> 00:02:50,304
So it's really important to involve
all people with disabilities.

43
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:52,464
When you're talking about accessibility.

44
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:54,835
So a little bit about me.

45
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:58,015
Why should you believe
anything I have to say?

46
00:02:58,315 --> 00:03:00,445
Well, I started in 1998.

47
00:03:00,835 --> 00:03:04,285
I like to say, I know if you've
seen a presentation from me before,

48
00:03:04,555 --> 00:03:08,035
you'll have heard this joke a
number of times, but I like to say

49
00:03:08,035 --> 00:03:11,755
I started when I was five years old,
but that's not actually the case.

50
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,109
I worked on the first accessible
website in Australia, and I

51
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:19,530
created Australia's first automated
accessibility testing tool.

52
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,290
I spent six years as an invited expert
to the W three C WCA two working group,

53
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,480
working on the web content accessibility
guidelines, version two, I worked

54
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,530
on the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth
Games and every Commonwealth Games

55
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:39,060
since then, and I spent five years
managing usability and accessibility

56
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,280
services at Monash University.

57
00:03:42,065 --> 00:03:48,035
I left Monash University in 2011 and I
founded Accessibility Oz. We were released

58
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:49,925
the products, Aus Player and Azat.

59
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:55,145
I spoke at the United Nations
on web accessibility in 2015.

60
00:03:55,475 --> 00:03:59,555
I was inducted into the Australia's
Hall of Fame as accessibility

61
00:03:59,555 --> 00:04:05,555
person of the year in 2019, and I
am currently the chair of the mobile

62
00:04:05,555 --> 00:04:07,145
Accessibility Testing Guidelines.

63
00:04:07,995 --> 00:04:09,615
So let's get into it.

64
00:04:09,765 --> 00:04:11,445
Let's talk about security.

65
00:04:12,015 --> 00:04:13,695
So I wanna start with an anecdote.

66
00:04:15,945 --> 00:04:21,435
In 2018, Angus Taylor, who's an
Australian politician, produced A PDF,

67
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:26,355
which said that the city of Sydney's
annual travel budget was $15 million.

68
00:04:26,985 --> 00:04:32,534
So who cares if the annual travel budget
for a city council is $15 million?

69
00:04:32,985 --> 00:04:36,885
Angus Taylor had been criticizing
the Lord Mayor of Sydney over

70
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:42,735
emissions based on this PDF, and so
supposedly the City of Sydney's annual

71
00:04:42,735 --> 00:04:47,445
report, which was available on their
website, said that the city of Sydney

72
00:04:47,445 --> 00:04:49,995
spent over $15 million worth of.

73
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:56,990
Travel when if you looked at the actual
original PDF, it was only $6,000.

74
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,750
So council proved that the annual report
on the website firstly had never changed,

75
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:08,600
had always said that they'd only spent
$6,000 on international travel, and that

76
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,360
Angus Taylor had produced a adopted PDF.

77
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,310
So why is this important?

78
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,330
This is important because a
lot of people think that the

79
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,730
reason to use A PDF is security.

80
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:25,320
You need to use A PDF because
no one can change it and

81
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,450
therefore it's a secure format.

82
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,400
But that's really not the case.

83
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,045
Uh, if you look at this
particular example.

84
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,410
It's very easy to alter A PDF,
and it's something that I'm sure

85
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,090
a lot of us have already done.

86
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,820
So in our disability discrimination
advisory notes, which is an Australian

87
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,740
document, they specified that some
file formats provide mechanisms

88
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,910
for enhancing the security of
documents by preventing unauthorized

89
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,890
editing, copying, or printing.

90
00:05:56,909 --> 00:06:00,659
Some of these mechanisms are not
compatible with accessibility for

91
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:05,340
people with this disability and document
authors should ensure that security

92
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,539
features do not prevent access to
the document by assistive technology.

93
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:14,099
So this is basically turning the
security feature on and off with PDS.

94
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,760
This is not an issue anymore, but it is
something that has been talked about.

95
00:06:18,719 --> 00:06:22,680
If there are concerns about ensuring
the authenticity of material published

96
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,580
on the web in multiple formats,
then a statement should be included

97
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:31,710
that specifies which format is to be
regarded as definitive or authorized,

98
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,120
and noting that additional formats
are being provided to maximize access.

99
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,420
But if we think about it,
what's more secure than a PDF?

100
00:06:40,455 --> 00:06:44,025
Of course, I know none of you can
answer me, but what's more secure than

101
00:06:44,025 --> 00:06:47,565
a PDF an HTML webpage on your website?

102
00:06:47,805 --> 00:06:52,544
I can tell you right now that I can
doctor A PDF that you give me, but

103
00:06:52,544 --> 00:06:56,685
I cannot hack into your website and
change the data that's on your website.

104
00:06:56,955 --> 00:07:01,875
So the City of Sydney could prove
that that PDF was dock because

105
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:06,104
they had uploaded one document
and one document only to the CMS.

106
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,950
And they could prove through the CMS
details that that document hadn't changed.

107
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,300
So once again, something that you might
think you need to use because of security

108
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,640
provision is not actually the case.

109
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,510
Now you know that PDFs are
not a way to provide secure

110
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,430
information and H TM L website is.

111
00:07:25,185 --> 00:07:26,655
Let's talk about capture.

112
00:07:27,105 --> 00:07:31,245
I know a lot of security consultants
and the argument I always have

113
00:07:31,245 --> 00:07:32,985
with them is about capture.

114
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:38,025
So capture is basically a way to
make sure that bots don't fill out

115
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:41,175
your forms and submit them with,
you know, random information.

116
00:07:41,505 --> 00:07:45,615
Now, when it comes to WIC a, the web
content accessibility guidelines,

117
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:47,805
there is a specific requirement.

118
00:07:48,505 --> 00:07:54,355
Regarding capture under 1.1 0.1
non-text content, and it says all

119
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:59,034
non-text content that is presented to
the user has a text alternative that

120
00:07:59,034 --> 00:08:03,175
serves the equivalent purpose except
for the situations listed below.

121
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:05,815
And one of those
situations is the capture.

122
00:08:06,205 --> 00:08:11,065
If the purpose of non-text content is to
confirm that content is being accessed

123
00:08:11,065 --> 00:08:13,465
by a person rather than a computer.

124
00:08:13,705 --> 00:08:17,905
Then text alternatives that identify
and describe the purpose of the

125
00:08:17,905 --> 00:08:19,705
non-text content I provided.

126
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:24,955
And alternative forms of capture using
output modes for different types of

127
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:29,455
sensory perception are provided to
accommodate different disabilities.

128
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:34,975
But despite what the W three says or
because of it, which we'll see in a

129
00:08:34,975 --> 00:08:38,725
moment, every capture is inaccessible.

130
00:08:38,995 --> 00:08:40,465
Every capture, yes.

131
00:08:41,295 --> 00:08:41,895
Google's one.

132
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:43,095
Yes.

133
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:44,655
Even Google's one.

134
00:08:45,165 --> 00:08:46,545
Especially Google's one.

135
00:08:47,145 --> 00:08:51,225
And the reason why is because
the recapture that Google

136
00:08:51,225 --> 00:08:53,445
has created only pops up.

137
00:08:53,475 --> 00:08:54,585
If it thinks you're a bot.

138
00:08:55,155 --> 00:08:58,455
Guess what always comes across as a bot?

139
00:08:58,814 --> 00:09:03,225
A screen reader, reader, so it will
always be triggered when a screen

140
00:09:03,225 --> 00:09:08,085
reader user comes along and the
Google's recapture does not have an

141
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:13,485
audio recapture, or the audio recapture
is so bad, it is inaccessible.

142
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:17,895
So I have a number of friends
who cannot use the Google.

143
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:24,270
And funnily enough, despite what
success Criterion 1.1 0.1 says,

144
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:30,360
the W three C agrees, and this is
from their document about captures,

145
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,970
and I will tell you what it says.

146
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,069
Captures are a controversial topic in the
accessibility community, as is described

147
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,069
in the paper Inaccessibility of capture.

148
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,290
Captures intrinsically push the edges
of human abilities in an attempt

149
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,540
to defeat automated processes.

150
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,100
Every type of capture will be unsolvable
by users with certain disabilities.

151
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,930
However they're widely used and the
web content accessibility guidelines,

152
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,980
working group believes that if
captures were forbidden outright,

153
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,959
websites would choose not to conform
to a CAG rather than abandon capture.

154
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:11,100
So basically they're saying, Hey, we allow
you to have capture 'cause we really want

155
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,839
you to follow a cag, even though we all
know that it's not an accessible feature.

156
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:20,189
Websites abandoning WIC A would
create barriers for a great many

157
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,050
more users with disabilities.

158
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,920
For this reason, the working group has
chosen to structure the requirement

159
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,120
about capture in a way that meets the
needs of most people with disabilities,

160
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:34,709
yet is also considered adoptable
by sites requiring two different

161
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:36,840
forms of capture on a given site.

162
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,670
Ensures that most people with disabilities
will find a form they can use.

163
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,830
Some users with disabilities will
still not be able to access sites

164
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,780
that meet the minimum requirements.

165
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,320
The working group provides
recommendations for additional steps.

166
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,150
Organizations motivated to conform to
WA should be aware of the importance

167
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,840
of this topic and should go as far
beyond the minimum requirements

168
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,550
of the guidelines as possible.

169
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:09,030
Also, if you think about it, an audio
capture, which is where you press a little

170
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:15,555
button and it says, J. Q, capital C is.

171
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,150
Also inherently inaccessible.

172
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,170
So firstly, most bots can
interpret speech, so the audio

173
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,740
is often quite distorted and
therefore quite inaccessible.

174
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,710
And also audio captures are one and done.

175
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,330
It's very transient.

176
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,160
You hear it once and it's done.

177
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,780
Whereas a visual capture is persistent,
it's always there and you can look at it,

178
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,270
whereas audio capture, you hear it once.

179
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,170
And it's gone.

180
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,970
Therefore, it's gonna be inaccessible to
users who have memory problems or people

181
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,660
who don't have memory problems and just
can't remember a string of six letters.

182
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,475
Uh, and then the message turn on, the
audio capture may not be accessible.

183
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,660
The next thing to talk about
is accessible authentication.

184
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:04,065
Now, this was included in Wcad
2.2, which was released in October,

185
00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:09,180
2023, and they're going even further
and they're saying basically.

186
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,770
Captures are inaccessible again.

187
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,220
So the requirement, this is
at aa, so this is something

188
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,510
that everyone needs to follow.

189
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:22,270
The requirement is 3.3 0.8 accessible
authentication, minimum standard.

190
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,130
A cognitive function test such as
remembering a password or solving

191
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:31,180
a puzzle is not required for any
step in an authentication process.

192
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,950
Unless that step provides at least one of
the following, an alternative, so another

193
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:42,110
authentication method that does not rely
on a cognitive function test mechanism.

194
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,070
A mechanism is available to
assist the user in completing

195
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,720
the cognitive function test.

196
00:12:48,495 --> 00:12:49,605
Object recognition.

197
00:12:49,905 --> 00:12:53,175
The cognitive function test is
to recognize objects and go,

198
00:12:53,444 --> 00:12:55,155
Hey, that, that's recapture.

199
00:12:55,155 --> 00:12:55,755
That's great.

200
00:12:56,115 --> 00:12:57,885
And I have something to
say about that in a moment.

201
00:12:58,334 --> 00:12:59,685
And personal content.

202
00:12:59,954 --> 00:13:04,275
The cognitive function test is
to identify non-text content the

203
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:05,925
user provided to the website.

204
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:10,064
So the user uploaded a photo
and you show them six photos.

205
00:13:10,064 --> 00:13:11,834
They have to choose the
one that they've uploaded.

206
00:13:13,935 --> 00:13:18,015
And they say within this requirement,
if a capture is used as a part of

207
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:21,975
an authentication process, there
must be a method that does not

208
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:25,875
include a cognitive function test
unless it meets the exception.

209
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:29,655
If the test is based on something
the website has set, such as

210
00:13:29,655 --> 00:13:33,490
remembering or transcribing a
word or recognizing a picture.

211
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,530
The website provided that would
be a cognitive function test.

212
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,610
Recognizing objects, or a picture
that the user has provided

213
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:43,829
is a cognitive function test.

214
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:48,959
However, it is accepted at the AA
level an object in this context,

215
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,760
which is allowed an object.

216
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:55,110
In this context means the general
English definition, a material thing

217
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:59,250
that can be seen and touched and
can include vehicles and animals.

218
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,390
If the test goes beyond recognition,
EG multiply the number of

219
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,860
cats by the number of dogs.

220
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,970
That does not meet the exception,
but it does go further.

221
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,439
Says some forms of object rec
recognition may require an

222
00:14:13,439 --> 00:14:15,360
understanding of a particular culture.

223
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:19,199
For example, taxis can appear
differently in different locales.

224
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,354
Therefore this is an issue for
many people, including people with

225
00:14:23,354 --> 00:14:28,694
disabilities, but it is not considered
an accessibility specific issue, which

226
00:14:28,694 --> 00:14:31,814
is interesting 'cause it's basically
saying, Hey, we know people aren't gonna

227
00:14:31,814 --> 00:14:33,645
be able to use it, but you can use it.

228
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:34,905
You know, we'll allow you.

229
00:14:35,204 --> 00:14:41,385
So this requirement seems to specifically
allow Google Recapture, but if you

230
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:45,795
look back on that W three C capture
document, you'll see that they still

231
00:14:45,795 --> 00:14:48,194
say it's completely inaccessible.

232
00:14:48,194 --> 00:14:51,224
So really you have to avoid capture.

233
00:14:51,314 --> 00:14:52,365
Don't use capture.

234
00:14:53,714 --> 00:14:56,204
So everyone convinced captures bad.

235
00:14:56,985 --> 00:14:59,535
Capture's bad, non capture's good.

236
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,425
So what do you do instead?

237
00:15:01,845 --> 00:15:06,165
If you must have a capture, you
must provide more than two mo

238
00:15:06,525 --> 00:15:10,185
modalities of capture for a given
action and make sure they work.

239
00:15:10,485 --> 00:15:14,925
And so if you have an audio
capture, make sure it's something

240
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,215
that the user can repeat.

241
00:15:16,455 --> 00:15:19,995
Put in an email and they'll send the
capture to you, that kind of stuff.

242
00:15:20,505 --> 00:15:23,925
Or provide access to a human
customer service representative.

243
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:29,635
Notice I say human who can bypass
the capture or do not require

244
00:15:29,755 --> 00:15:31,555
captures for authorized users.

245
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:35,665
Better alternatives are
multifactor authentication.

246
00:15:35,845 --> 00:15:37,225
Human test questions.

247
00:15:37,225 --> 00:15:39,955
IE Is fire hot or cold?

248
00:15:40,015 --> 00:15:43,080
The person has to write hot
Is grass green or purple?

249
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:46,125
They have to be very basic questions.

250
00:15:46,305 --> 00:15:49,214
Honeypot traps, which are
fields that must be left blank.

251
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,435
They're hidden from all users.

252
00:15:51,435 --> 00:15:54,675
Make sure they're hidden from
screen reader users as well.

253
00:15:54,675 --> 00:15:57,645
And if they're filled out,
then don't accept the form.

254
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,240
There's also things like service side,
spam filters, service side validation.

255
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,090
Other options include things like,
uh, confirmation page, screen

256
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,450
after the form submission that
says, here's your information.

257
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,070
Are you happy to submit this?

258
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,745
You know, timestamp your forms.

259
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,204
If the form is submitted
faster than humanly possible,

260
00:16:19,475 --> 00:16:20,944
odds are it's a spam bot.

261
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:24,574
Uh, proof of work, JavaScript
code, heuristics of the

262
00:16:24,574 --> 00:16:26,704
user, limited use accounts.

263
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,215
So there's a lot of different
ways, and that's only some of them.

264
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:33,275
If you need to convince someone
else without making them watch this

265
00:16:33,275 --> 00:16:41,959
presentation, uh, have a look@tinyurl.com
slash A one one Y. Dash capture.

266
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:47,540
So that's tiny url.com/a1 y dash capture.

267
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,270
Okay, so let's talk about forms.

268
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,689
There's a bunch of different WCA
requirements that can be quite

269
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:57,959
complicated, uh, including 2.2 0.1.

270
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,839
Timing adjustable, 3.3 0.1.

271
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:04,020
Error identification, 3.3 0.3.

272
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,810
Error suggestion, 3.3 0.4.

273
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:12,480
Error prevention, legal financial
data, 3.3 0.7, redundant entry, and

274
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,810
3.3 0.8 accessible authentication
minimum, which we just talked about.

275
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:21,599
So I'm gonna go through and give you
some examples of these so you know, not

276
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,659
what to do or you know, what not to do.

277
00:17:26,115 --> 00:17:28,125
First is 2.2 0.1.

278
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:32,115
Timing adjustable for each time
limit that is set by the content, at

279
00:17:32,115 --> 00:17:33,735
least one of the following is true.

280
00:17:34,215 --> 00:17:35,475
One turn off.

281
00:17:35,565 --> 00:17:39,435
The user is allowed to turn off the
time limit before encountering it.

282
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:40,935
Two, adjust.

283
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,895
The user is allowed to
adjust the time limit before

284
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:47,024
encountering it over a wide range.

285
00:17:47,325 --> 00:17:50,175
That is at least 10 times the
length of the default setting or.

286
00:17:51,255 --> 00:17:52,875
Three, extend.

287
00:17:53,175 --> 00:17:58,275
The user is warned before time expires
and given at least 20 seconds to extend

288
00:17:58,275 --> 00:18:00,375
the time limit with a simple action.

289
00:18:00,615 --> 00:18:04,635
For example, press the space bar
and the user is allowed to extend

290
00:18:04,635 --> 00:18:06,765
the time limit at least 10 times.

291
00:18:07,035 --> 00:18:09,645
Or for real time exception.

292
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:12,975
The time limit is a required
part of a real time event.

293
00:18:13,335 --> 00:18:17,080
For example, an auction and no
alternative to the time limit is possible.

294
00:18:18,045 --> 00:18:19,635
So this is an example here.

295
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:25,754
It's, um, an iPhone app and it's
about to, uh, time out and it

296
00:18:25,754 --> 00:18:29,774
gives you a little popup and it
says, do you want one more minute?

297
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:33,585
Remind me in 15 minutes, Eric,
ignore the limit for today.

298
00:18:33,825 --> 00:18:37,110
So it provides both options to
turn off or extend the time.

299
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:42,990
Here is another example, a popup
that says, are you still working?

300
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,700
And it's got a little timer starting
from one minute and it's counting down.

301
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,929
You are about to be logged out due to
inactivity, and there are two buttons.

302
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,909
Log out and keep working.

303
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,310
This is another example.

304
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,780
Wanna stay logged in.

305
00:18:58,215 --> 00:19:00,885
You are about to be logged
out due to inactivity.

306
00:19:01,365 --> 00:19:02,325
Uh, two buttons.

307
00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:03,975
Sign out, stay logged in.

308
00:19:04,425 --> 00:19:07,185
Time remaining before sign
off one minute and 28 seconds.

309
00:19:08,865 --> 00:19:13,035
And there are two more exceptions,
which is the essential exception,

310
00:19:13,395 --> 00:19:15,285
which is the time limit is essential.

311
00:19:15,285 --> 00:19:17,865
And extending it would
invalidate the activity.

312
00:19:18,135 --> 00:19:20,895
So, for example, think of a CPR test.

313
00:19:21,165 --> 00:19:25,305
You can't give someone extra time,
you know, to save someone's life,

314
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:28,665
they have to do it within the, you
know, the first minute or et cetera.

315
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:34,755
Uh, that's an an example of an essential
timeout or a 20 hour exception.

316
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:36,975
The time limit is longer than 20 hours.

317
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,990
So the next requirement is
3.3 0.1 error identification.

318
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,220
If an input error is automatically
detected, the item that is in

319
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,390
error is identified and the error
is described to the user in text.

320
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,820
So this is an example here.

321
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,690
It looks like there's an error message,
but quite frankly it's not very helpful.

322
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,840
So you can see the card number there is.

323
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,445
Not a real card number.

324
00:20:02,745 --> 00:20:06,795
The error message says, please enter
your payment information to continue

325
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:11,805
when the error message should really say,
you know, your card number should be 16

326
00:20:11,865 --> 00:20:13,965
digits, or something along those lines.

327
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:20,925
That kind of error that we see there is
at least better than this error, which

328
00:20:20,925 --> 00:20:33,705
is invalid product 8 9 3 B nine four
A 90 D 4 9 2 1 6 D 4 2 6 CD available.

329
00:20:33,885 --> 00:20:35,205
You see how annoying that was.

330
00:20:35,265 --> 00:20:39,225
That's what a screen reader would read,
and that's only, you know, the top three

331
00:20:39,225 --> 00:20:41,625
lines of say, a 20 line error message.

332
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:44,595
So definitely provide better
error messages than that.

333
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:48,945
The next requirement is 3.3 0.3.

334
00:20:48,945 --> 00:20:49,935
Error suggestion.

335
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:53,865
If an input error is automatically
detected and suggestions for

336
00:20:53,865 --> 00:20:57,405
correction are known, then the
suggestions are provided to the

337
00:20:57,405 --> 00:21:01,425
user unless it would jeopardize the
security or purpose of the content.

338
00:21:01,725 --> 00:21:06,195
So note that it says if you can't
provide suggestions because it

339
00:21:06,195 --> 00:21:10,065
would jeopardize the security of
the content, then you don't have to.

340
00:21:10,065 --> 00:21:12,254
So WAC has thought about security.

341
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,560
This is an example here.

342
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,750
Please enter birth year
in four digits, EG 1974.

343
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,450
So it's the EG that is
the error suggestion.

344
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,940
And so people can see that their
birth year of 81 is not okay because

345
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,010
they have to put 19 before it.

346
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:36,929
Also, if it's a common mistake, then
you know, make that clear to the user

347
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:38,879
and tell them what they need to do.

348
00:21:39,209 --> 00:21:41,399
Here it says Error, unknown error.

349
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:43,949
Check the detailed error
for more information.

350
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:47,790
I mean, that's not great, but here
it says, candidate has already

351
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,800
been invited to take the same test.

352
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,360
If you want to re-invite, cancel
the invite in your hacker rank for

353
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,870
work account first, so it tells
you exactly what you need to do.

354
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,760
So that's an error suggestion as well.

355
00:22:01,245 --> 00:22:07,335
Then we have 3.3 0.4 error prevention,
legal, financial data for webpages that

356
00:22:07,335 --> 00:22:11,805
cause legal commitments or financial
transactions for the user to occur

357
00:22:11,835 --> 00:22:17,025
that modify or delete user controllable
data in data storage systems or

358
00:22:17,025 --> 00:22:21,225
that submit user test responses, at
least one of the following is true.

359
00:22:21,615 --> 00:22:23,175
One reversible.

360
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,095
So submissions are reversible.

361
00:22:25,485 --> 00:22:27,135
Two checked data.

362
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:32,090
Entered by the user is checked for
input errors and the user is provided

363
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,500
an opportunity to correct them.

364
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:39,110
And three or three confirmed a
mechanism is available for reviewing,

365
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:43,460
confirming, and correcting information
before finalizing the submission.

366
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,940
So this is especially important.

367
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,560
If someone's going to delete something.

368
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:54,060
So having a popup or something along
the lines of this which says, are

369
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,740
you sure you wanna delete this post?

370
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,660
You know, cancel or delete.

371
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,420
Are you sure you want
to publish this post?

372
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,889
Um, et cetera.

373
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,139
Those are the kind of
things that you need to add.

374
00:23:04,379 --> 00:23:08,035
Or a page which shows everything and
says, Hey, is this what you wanna submit?

375
00:23:09,615 --> 00:23:13,665
So next we have redundant entry
information previously entered

376
00:23:13,665 --> 00:23:17,115
by or provided to the user
that is required to be entered.

377
00:23:17,115 --> 00:23:21,675
Again, in the same process is either
auto-populated or available for

378
00:23:21,675 --> 00:23:24,165
the user to select except when.

379
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,790
Reentering the information is essential.

380
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:32,550
The information is required to ensure
the security of the content or previously

381
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,650
entered information is no longer valid.

382
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,980
So once again, this is something
that you can do, but if it's

383
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,430
gonna mess with your security too
much, you don't need to do it.

384
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,110
And so the kind of example here
is auto complete, having auto

385
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,750
complete for email password address.

386
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,020
Uh, that kind of stuff is gonna
make using your forms a whole

387
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:56,740
lot more accessible and shouldn't
mess with your security too much.

388
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,080
So thank you for coming today.

389
00:23:59,379 --> 00:24:00,640
