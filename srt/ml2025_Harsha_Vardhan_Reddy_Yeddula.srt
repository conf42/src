00:00:15,899 --> 00:00:19,320
for the advanced document management
system, revolutionizing the

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,480
efficiency, compiles and automation
in today's ATE business environment.

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,590
Organization face increasing
challenges in managing the.

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,840
Vast amounts of document data and
whether it's invoices, contract,

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,620
the insurance claims, or the
regulatory documents efficiently.

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,879
Extracting and analyzing this data
is very crucial for operational

12
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,070
efficiency and compliance.

13
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:48,885
And Microsoft Machine Learning offers
a powerful platform to address these

14
00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:53,355
challenges by integrating AI and
machine learning technologies with the

15
00:00:53,355 --> 00:00:57,915
document management systems, enabling
the automation and data driven insights,

16
00:00:58,245 --> 00:01:01,905
and streamline the workflows across
the industries, including the life

17
00:01:01,905 --> 00:01:06,655
sciences, the healthcare insurance,
and general purpose operations.

18
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,120
And my name is re I'm a Microsoft
certified professional, a technology

19
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,290
specialist, and also play like
a Microsoft 365 Cloud architect.

20
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,240
And I play a technical manager.

21
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,160
So for the various projects
which I work on through my 17

22
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:28,079
years of IT industry experience
coming to this, machine learning.

23
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,299
For the document management system,
we will see the various extraction

24
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:36,229
methodologies or the models and
how we can leverage this machine

25
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:39,409
learning for our document system
into the various industries.

26
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,019
When coming to this topic, automated data
extraction on the classification, we see

27
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:49,119
like how it reduce the manual effort, the
cost reduction, and the intelligent class.

28
00:01:49,124 --> 00:01:52,784
Applications when it comes to the
manual effort, the Azure Machine

29
00:01:52,844 --> 00:01:57,254
Learning automates the data extraction
from the various document types.

30
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:01,004
It's significantly reducing
the manual data entry and

31
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:03,039
the associated human errors.

32
00:02:03,714 --> 00:02:07,335
When it comes to the cost reduction,
the company is using this AI

33
00:02:07,365 --> 00:02:08,945
powered document processing.

34
00:02:09,215 --> 00:02:14,925
See up to 30 to 50% reduction in
operational costs related to data entries,

35
00:02:14,925 --> 00:02:19,545
operational costs related to data entry
task, and the intelligent classification.

36
00:02:19,545 --> 00:02:22,275
Intelligent classification
is like a machine learning.

37
00:02:22,555 --> 00:02:26,565
Azure Mission Learning classifies
model classifies and tag the documents

38
00:02:26,565 --> 00:02:30,735
based on the content, categorization
them into the relevant groups of.

39
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,290
Relevant groups for efficient Val Azure AI
document AI document intelligence, which

40
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,890
is formally form, like form recognition.

41
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:39,910
It extracts all the.

42
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,630
Structure data such as the dates,
amount, the names, and the product

43
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:49,490
details, and the ID card details from
the various documents like the invoices,

44
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:54,119
contracts, and regulatory forms, and
streamlining the inform and streamlining

45
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:55,919
the information management process.

46
00:02:56,749 --> 00:03:00,529
When it comes to the when it comes to
the search capabilities, when it comes

47
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:03,919
to the search capabilities that in
the document management system, such

48
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,059
capabilities plays a critical role
because, like for the business users way,

49
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:11,804
they search for the particular document
in the traditional approach, they use the

50
00:03:11,804 --> 00:03:16,694
keyboard to search for the document and
where, how we are enhancing the security.

51
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:21,344
Like how about this, how to differentiate
between the general documents and the.

52
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:25,309
Sensitive document and for showing for
one department, the document should

53
00:03:25,309 --> 00:03:29,369
not be shown and one for document for
one department it has to be shown like

54
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:33,239
the for HR document cannot be shown
to the employees and the employees.

55
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:36,929
Documents to business documents
cannot be shown to the customers.

56
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,060
So in this way, like how we enhance
this capital, this machine learning,

57
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:44,959
we will see how this machine learning
enhances the such capabilities when

58
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,829
it comes to the traditional approach,
semantic analysis and improved results

59
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:52,670
in the traditional approach is nothing
but the keyboard based methods often

60
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,220
fall with the short, ambiguous terms.

61
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,640
When it comes next to the semantic
analysis, Azure artificial

62
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,570
intelligence analyzes the context
and the intent behind the.

63
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:04,529
Queries improved results.

64
00:04:04,529 --> 00:04:05,430
Improved results.

65
00:04:05,435 --> 00:04:09,489
This results it re, it returns
the relevant documents even with

66
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:11,419
the in incomplete search tab.

67
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:14,959
Azure ai, Azure Artificial
Intelligence search.

68
00:04:15,454 --> 00:04:18,869
Enhance enhances the document
tool by understanding the

69
00:04:18,869 --> 00:04:22,339
meeting behind the search queries
rather than just the keyboards.

70
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:27,189
What this is particularly valuable for
the large document repositories where

71
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:31,829
the traditional search models often
fall in written more relevant results.

72
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:37,824
And coming to the, one of the key area
for the mission learning for document

73
00:04:37,824 --> 00:04:42,264
management system is like automating
document workflows, how we can automate

74
00:04:42,264 --> 00:04:46,044
the document workflows from the manual
approach to the traditional approach

75
00:04:46,044 --> 00:04:48,054
to the advanced workflow systems.

76
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:52,089
When the whenever the business upload
the document, either into the Microsoft

77
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:56,319
SharePoint, there's a repository
or to the blog storage repository.

78
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:00,399
What, and when the document is uploaded,
what is artificial intelligence?

79
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,434
What it'll do, it'll analyze this.

80
00:05:03,124 --> 00:05:05,644
The help of this machine
learning, Azure machine learning.

81
00:05:05,854 --> 00:05:11,044
It analyzes, classifies and extracts
the key data of the document and

82
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,554
it transforms into the workflow
trigger at a workflow trigger.

83
00:05:14,554 --> 00:05:19,054
Here the Microsoft uses the advanced
workflow systems like a Microsoft

84
00:05:19,054 --> 00:05:24,224
Power Automate, and Azure Logical Apps
undo Azure function apps, which are

85
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:27,004
built on top of this Microsoft Cloud.

86
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:31,689
So the with workflow trigger system
indicates the notifications, updates or

87
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:36,960
the approval process parallel up towards
it has all three facilities to connect

88
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,309
with the external connectors, like a
business to business B2B integrations,

89
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,049
and to perform these automated
documents workflows and transforming

90
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:47,484
to the next completion status.

91
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:52,509
The process it process the completes
with a minimal human interventions.

92
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,669
We use something like here, Azure
Azure Logical Apps and Azure

93
00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:01,140
functions enable the automation of
the document workflows significantly

94
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,429
reducing the manual intervention and
accelerating the decision making.

95
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,749
According to the recent, according
to the recent data, automating

96
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:13,159
the workflows can lead up to the
40% of the operational efficiency.

97
00:06:13,429 --> 00:06:17,080
This is this, document workflow place,
automating the document workflows in

98
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,850
this IT industry for the various of the
domains like insurance, in insurance, the

99
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,220
life senses, health, pharma, and retail.

100
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,060
Like these are all the IT domain,
which are heavily dependent on

101
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,540
the document management system
and the enterprise content

102
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,640
management system and the metadata.

103
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,550
Is very crucial here.

104
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,270
And it also, the classifications and
between the sensitive data and the

105
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,620
non-sensitive data and the record
retentions, and these are all, that

106
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,620
plays a very critical role, even
with from one process when it, when

107
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,490
the workflow processing from one
department, the another department,

108
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:59,854
and this is how the Azure machine
learning helps helps the business.

109
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:04,979
Help the business users through this
document management system process.

110
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,719
And when it comes to this compliance and
security monitoring, this compliance and

111
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:14,899
security monitoring is one of, is also one
of the three key critical area for the.

112
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:18,894
Azure Machine learning, the document
management system, the compliance and

113
00:07:18,894 --> 00:07:24,104
security monitoring, how we do this, like
document analysis compliance verification,

114
00:07:24,134 --> 00:07:27,254
issue detection, and automated deduction.

115
00:07:27,254 --> 00:07:30,674
Automated reduction is nothing
but a hiding or removal of the

116
00:07:30,674 --> 00:07:32,694
certain certain information.

117
00:07:32,964 --> 00:07:37,074

Azure's integration with the tools

167
00:10:54,415 --> 00:10:59,645
like the Power ba transforms the
extracted doctor in into the actionable

168
00:10:59,645 --> 00:11:02,525
insights in quality management systems.

169
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:03,895
Users can visualize.

170
00:11:04,285 --> 00:11:07,675
Audit findings like audit findings
we can say recertifications of the

171
00:11:07,675 --> 00:11:11,155
systems under the risk assessment,
under the document status, whether it's

172
00:11:11,155 --> 00:11:16,255
in like draft status, approved status
approval, pending up rejection status,

173
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:22,015
and enabling the informed, the decision
making based on that real time data.

174
00:11:23,785 --> 00:11:25,615
Scalability and security.

175
00:11:25,615 --> 00:11:28,765
In this scalability and security
measures, you will see how the

176
00:11:28,765 --> 00:11:32,695
enterprise grade security happened,
the cloud native infrastructure, how

177
00:11:32,695 --> 00:11:36,835
the native infrastructure is happening,
and how the role-based access controls

178
00:11:37,075 --> 00:11:41,585
is helping under data encryption,
enterprise grade security, comprehensive

179
00:11:41,585 --> 00:11:46,595
protection for the comprehensive
protection for sensitive documents.

180
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:50,075
It just like how we are
making the documents like the.

181
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:55,685
Once the document is once the document
is uploaded and it, when it passed,

182
00:11:55,685 --> 00:11:59,045
the certain stages of the approval
passes, that the document has to

183
00:11:59,045 --> 00:12:04,295
get log his state by making the read
through the record management of the.

184
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,830
Part of the document management system,
how the cloud native infrastructure,

185
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,610
not only always with the security
of these external tools and how the

186
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:18,060
infrastructure also backed by backed
by this system and how it is helping

187
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,870
this document management system.

188
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,300
It is through this back by the Azure
Kubernetes sub service you can also call

189
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,340
at is a Kubernetes as a K eight service.

190
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,665
And the role-based access
controls in the real world.

191
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:33,870
In the real world particularly in the
documents document management system.

192
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,140
The role-based access controls are very
very crucial between the departments,

193
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,760
between the users, from the, for
example, for the insurance documents.

194
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,310
It can be from the policies, the claims.

195
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:51,550
The re policies casualities department,
personal property, and various

196
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,170
kinds of various kinds of insurance
things between the department.

197
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,270
The document should not be
shown how we choose this.

198
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,090
It is achieved through the
rule-based access control.

199
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:04,590
It means adding granular permission
management, like a unique

200
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:08,550
permission to only see the document,
who are eligible to see the.

201
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,550
Document not the other not the
other business customers or the

202
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,990
customers or any department.

203
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,340
Data encryption.

204
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,890
Data encryption is crucial.

205
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,800
Like it's, it has to be
like end-to-end production.

206
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:21,790
End-to-end production.

207
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,210
It's not to be the, it's not to be
exposed to the third one, right?

208
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:28,720
So end-to-end production, but it's
like a one-to-one kind of thing.

209
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:33,720
And mission learning provides Azure
robust security features, ensuring.

210
00:13:34,075 --> 00:13:36,985
That sensitive information
remains protected.

211
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:38,635
As the organizations scale their.

212
00:13:39,075 --> 00:13:39,375
Scaled.

213
00:13:39,495 --> 00:13:43,745
The operations assured machine learning
infrastructure ensures that mission

214
00:13:43,745 --> 00:13:47,975
learning models can be deployed at
a deployed at a scale of the real

215
00:13:47,975 --> 00:13:52,040
time in inference without compromis
without compromising the performance

216
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,560
or the security when it comes to this.

217
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,970
Implementation benefits.

218
00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:00,820
We should also see that when, whenever
free or implementing a system, whenever

219
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,750
we are utilizing some, technology, the
models, the artificial intelligence,

220
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,950
whether it can be a cloud or enterprise
or talk, whatever the system, we need

221
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:12,940
to see whether it is a, whether that
the cost reduction is there or not.

222
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,430
Whether we are gaining the
efficiency gain is there or not.

223
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,510
Whether it is part of the.

224
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,730
Compiles is improving or not?

225
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:23,570
Here when it comes to the implementation
benefit, there is a 50% of cost reduction,

226
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:28,070
decrease in the operational cost
related to the document processing and

227
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,730
reducing the paper thing, reducing the
paper thing, reducing the manual thing,

228
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,110
reducing increasing the efficiency.

229
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,700
And it's like efficiency.

230
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,590
It's like a 40% of efficiency gain.

231
00:14:38,305 --> 00:14:41,205
In improvement in improvement
in the operation, implement in

232
00:14:41,205 --> 00:14:44,885
the operational efficiencies and
through this workflow automation.

233
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:50,465
So workflow automations plays a key role
in eliminating the manual process and

234
00:14:50,465 --> 00:14:56,225
the manual approaches, and 70% of the
compiles improvement is not only about

235
00:14:56,225 --> 00:14:57,995
the automation or the cost reduction.

236
00:14:58,325 --> 00:15:03,005
It also improves the compiles improvement
by, in reducing the likelihood

237
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,805
of this regulatory violations.

238
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:09,500
Organizations implementing the machine
learning for the document management

239
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,600
see a significant measurable benefits.

240
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:16,530
These improvements translate to better
resourcing allocation, allowing the

241
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:21,960
teams to focus on strategy task instead
of manually administrating work while

242
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,845
maintaining a high compelling standard.

243
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,450
Coming to this coming to this roadmap.

244
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,360
Coming to this roadmap when
it comes to the Azure machine

245
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,480
learning models or methodology.

246
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,850
So we will see how the
RA roadmap will be there.

247
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,010
The one is like the
assessment and planning.

248
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,850
It'll, any implementation roadmap,
whether it's machine learning,

249
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,000
whether it's artificial intelligence,
or it's the cloud or the standard

250
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,150
waterfall or any process, any project
we start, it goes with the plan.

251
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,710
It's like assessment and planning
model development and training,

252
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:58,970
integration and deployment and
optimization under the expansion.

253
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,810
So when it comes to the first
one, the assessment and planning.

254
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:09,620
So what it does like in an assessment and
planning, we evaluate the current document

255
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:17,300
process, identify the pain points, and
define specific objective goals for

256
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,220
the mission learning implementation.

257
00:16:19,595 --> 00:16:23,825
Determine which document types
and the number of the workflow,

258
00:16:23,825 --> 00:16:27,395
the type of the workflows will
benefit from the automation.

259
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:30,845
It can be workflows when I mentioned
like the type of the workflow,

260
00:16:30,905 --> 00:16:35,890
whether it's automated or it's a
diamond or it should based or it's

261
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,475
trigger based on other action.

262
00:16:38,305 --> 00:16:43,465
Or it can be like a business B2B
workflows, or it can be like a customized

263
00:16:43,465 --> 00:16:47,245
workflows or connecting workflows
triggered based on another workflow.

264
00:16:47,575 --> 00:16:51,215
So this kind of the automation benefit
this kind of workflows which will

265
00:16:51,215 --> 00:16:54,460
benefit for most of the automation
from the most, from the automation.

266
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,480
When it comes to the model
development and training.

267
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:02,720
So in this model development and training
this is the next sta this is next stage

268
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,820
to the assessment and the planning.

269
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,875
In this model development, we we
start with what we gather the, and

270
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:13,105
what we plan in the first to phase
of the assessment and planning.

271
00:17:13,435 --> 00:17:18,085
In this model, we completely
concentrate on developing and

272
00:17:18,085 --> 00:17:20,905
training Azure methodology models.

273
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:26,250
Specific to your document types
and the business requirements here.

274
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,905
So here we don't do, again analysis.

275
00:17:28,905 --> 00:17:31,725
We will just do an improvement
in case of any assessment

276
00:17:31,965 --> 00:17:33,285
according to the development.

277
00:17:33,825 --> 00:17:37,575
But all the assessment will happen at
the fastest stage, and the planning

278
00:17:37,575 --> 00:17:38,955
will happen at the fastest stage.

279
00:17:39,335 --> 00:17:43,145
So in this development we just
train the Azure methodology model

280
00:17:43,475 --> 00:17:47,125
specific to the document types
and the business requirement.

281
00:17:47,205 --> 00:17:49,425
This includes the data extraction models.

282
00:17:49,755 --> 00:17:53,355
And the classification systems and
the compiling verification tools.

283
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:56,445
And next comes to the, once the
development, once assessment

284
00:17:56,445 --> 00:17:59,535
and the planning is completed,
and we once we complete the

285
00:17:59,535 --> 00:18:01,755
development and training, then what?

286
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:05,055
Then it's like the integration
and we have to deploy some

287
00:18:05,055 --> 00:18:07,425
where what we develop, right?

288
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:11,385
So the develop integration deployment,
integrate the Azure machine learning

289
00:18:11,385 --> 00:18:16,245
solution with the existing document
management systems and the workflows

290
00:18:16,485 --> 00:18:18,015
that has been developed in the.

291
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,300
Second stage of the model development
and training, deploy those models

292
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,020
to the production environments or
from the lower environments to the

293
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:33,480
upper environments with appropriate
monitoring and the security controls.

294
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,400
Once this deployment is completed,
we will go to the next process

295
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,620
of the step like optimization and
how we can expand this process.

296
00:18:43,635 --> 00:18:48,265
Like that, what we have done from
the assessment and planning and

297
00:18:48,265 --> 00:18:52,155
building the development and after the
integration and develop deployment.

298
00:18:52,395 --> 00:18:58,545
So we have to see where we can expand this
kind of solutions into the other system.

299
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,155
Like continuously optimization.

300
00:19:01,185 --> 00:19:02,145
What is an optimization?

301
00:19:02,145 --> 00:19:07,885
It's like continuously improvise the
model accuracy and expand implementation

302
00:19:07,915 --> 00:19:13,585
to additional document types and business
processes based on measured results.

303
00:19:14,585 --> 00:19:15,365
Conclusion.

304
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:18,215
Conclusion and revolutionizing
the document management.

305
00:19:18,245 --> 00:19:22,835
It is enhanced operational in
revolutionizing the document management.

306
00:19:22,835 --> 00:19:28,025
Here in this section, you'll see how the
enhanced operational efficiency improved

307
00:19:28,025 --> 00:19:33,275
compile, and we discuss and data driven
insights and superior customer experience.

308
00:19:33,275 --> 00:19:37,985
The customer experience is the most
important thing for all the work

309
00:19:37,985 --> 00:19:40,295
we have done through this mission.

310
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:42,965
Learning for the document
management system.

311
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:49,715
So for anything the customer experience
is the most top priority in the project.

312
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:54,515
So enhanced operational efficiency in the
significant improvements in the processing

313
00:19:54,515 --> 00:19:59,405
time and the cost savings through the
AI powered automation improved compiles.

314
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:03,395
How the better the adherence to
regulatory requirements with the

315
00:20:03,395 --> 00:20:07,985
automated monitoring and the verification
data driven insight, transformation

316
00:20:07,985 --> 00:20:10,205
of a document data into actionable.

317
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:15,700
Business intelligence, superior
customer experience, the faster response

318
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,200
time, faster response times, and
more accurate information delivery.

319
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:25,510
So integrating we can achieve all
these things by integrating the machine

320
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:29,835
learning, integrating the machine learning
with with the document management system.

321
00:20:29,975 --> 00:20:31,760
The document management
system which offers un.

322
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,830
Precedent opportunities to optimize the
document processing to ensure, compile

323
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:43,260
and improve data accessibility and
automated workflows in the real world.

324
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,610
Results in the real world.

325
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,090
Results speak for themselves
with the business, seeing a

326
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,590
significant improvements across
all the operational metrics.

327
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,990
And we'll coming to the final section
of this section, and we have seen how.

328
00:20:58,275 --> 00:21:02,175
How the mission learning for the document
management is revolutionizing the

329
00:21:02,175 --> 00:21:05,505
complexities and helping the business,

330
00:21:08,055 --> 00:21:11,115
and helping the business
insurance, the life sensors.

331
00:21:11,325 --> 00:21:14,685
And here we'll also see in the
real time how it is getting

332

00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:01,340
The AA algorithms are now capable of
analyzing the historical claims data,

344
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:06,740
identifying the patents that can be
used to predict what we can predict

345
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,800
the fraud, or assess the risk levels.

346
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:15,470
In addition to this, the claims
processing time is reduced as yay.

347

00:22:54,765 --> 00:22:58,905
And these are all the things which we use
during this life sensors like standard

358
00:22:58,905 --> 00:23:02,805
operational procedures, which are called
the S four piece and the call pass.

359
00:23:03,195 --> 00:23:06,695
Like a corrective actions and the
pre preventive actions, ensuring the

360
00:23:06,695 --> 00:23:11,615
compiles and the regulatory standards
by tracking the document revisions,

361
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:17,340
auditing the reports, and ensuring that
standard operation, standard operating.

362
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,240
Procedures, SOPs are followed.

363
00:23:20,615 --> 00:23:25,075
A artificial intelligence ensures
that all processing, all processes

364
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:26,955
meet the industry standards.
