00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,200
Hello and welcome to Con 42 Golang 2025.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,580
It's a pleasure to be
here with all of you.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,840
My name is Misal, and today we are
going to explore a topic that's

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,260
shaping the future of IT operations,
automations, and monitoring tools.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,950
The, the landscape of systems
management has evolved dramatically, to.

6
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,840
Gone are the days of manual
troubleshooting issues and

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,330
reacting after failure occurs.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,805
Instead, modern enterprises are now
leveraging intelligent solutions to

9
00:00:35,805 --> 00:00:41,775
detect, prevent, and even resolve
incidents before the impact operations.

10
00:00:42,135 --> 00:00:47,215
So over the, next few minutes, we
will be, diving deep into some of the

11
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:49,345
most of powerful tools in this space.

12
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,980
That's how they integrate with
the enterprise environment and

13
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,320
the key benefits they bring in.

14
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,960
So let's get started.

15
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,059
Automation is more than
just a convenience.

16
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:08,234
It's a necessity these days by
reducing manual intervention by nearly

17
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:12,740
80% organizations free of IT teams.

18
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:15,935
To focus on innovations rather
than routing maintenance.

19
00:01:16,385 --> 00:01:21,025
faster response times mean that
incidents are resolved before they

20
00:01:21,025 --> 00:01:22,940
escalate and increase accuracy.

21
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:26,965
Accuracy translates to
fewer costly errors.

22
00:01:27,895 --> 00:01:33,055
Studies show that automation leads
to a 40% drop in operational cost.

23
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:37,885
A significant financial
advantage for enterprises.

24
00:01:38,385 --> 00:01:44,205
With these benefits in mind, let's
explore how IT operations have evolved

25
00:01:44,235 --> 00:01:46,425
from a reactive to a predictive approach.

26
00:01:46,925 --> 00:01:51,225
Historically, IT teams only, reacted
to incidents after they occurred.

27
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,485
This meant extended downtimes
and increased disruptions.

28
00:01:55,995 --> 00:02:00,765
Moving to a proactive model, teams
began leveraging monitoring systems to.

29
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:03,135
Catch potential failures early.

30
00:02:03,635 --> 00:02:08,625
The real, breakthrough, however, is
the predictive operations with AI

31
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:15,965
powered analytics as organizations can
forecast failures with our 90% accuracy,

32
00:02:16,535 --> 00:02:20,975
preventing downtime altogether and keep
critical services running smoothly.

33
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:25,445
and, To make predictive
operations successful, we need

34
00:02:25,805 --> 00:02:28,475
a robust monitoring tools.

35
00:02:28,835 --> 00:02:33,955
So let's take a look at the two of the
most powerful tools exist in the market.

36
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:34,675
our

37
00:02:35,175 --> 00:02:37,620
Prometheus, and in our industry.

38
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,380
Leading monitoring solutions.

39
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,340
All so cells in high precision data
collection and alerting, making it

40
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,640
perfect for dynamic cloud environments.

41
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:54,670
Na s with its rich, plugin ecosystem and
a longstanding reputation is ideal for

42
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,240
comprehensive infrastructure oversight.

43
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,800
These organizations that integrate
these tools see, see, 94% improvement

44
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,600
in anomaly detection and maintain
the five nine availability.

45
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:13,205
So less, which is less, less than
five minutes of, downtime per year.

46
00:03:13,705 --> 00:03:16,315
But monitoring alone isn't enough.

47
00:03:17,065 --> 00:03:19,525
We also need deep observability.

48
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:23,425
and hence that's where Datadog
comes into the picture.

49
00:03:23,925 --> 00:03:29,165
As enterprise shift to the multi
cloud and hybrid environments,

50
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:30,575
visibility becomes critical.

51
00:03:31,095 --> 00:03:36,070
Datadog provides a unified view across
infrastructure, applications, and logs,

52
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,450
enabling teams to detect bottlenecks
and optimize performance in real time.

53
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:46,800
From granular quarter level, I'm
tracing to AI powered log analysis.

54
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,290
Datadog helps enterprises boost
system reliability by nearly 77%

55
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,590
while reducing meantime to solution

56
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,340
with cloud native monitoring in place.

57
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,645
Let's explore how AI is taking.

58
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:02,380
Okay.

59
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,325
IT operations.

60
00:04:03,355 --> 00:04:10,465
Even further, AI ops or ai, our IT
operations is, it's literally, we are

61
00:04:10,465 --> 00:04:16,675
transforming incident management instead
of waiting of for alerts, AI driven

62
00:04:16,675 --> 00:04:22,495
tools, continuously analyze patterns,
detect anomalies, and even shared

63
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:26,935
automated remediation, these self-healing.

64
00:04:27,565 --> 00:04:27,895
Billing.

65
00:04:28,395 --> 00:04:34,085
These self healing capabilities help
businesses reduce unplanned downtime and

66
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:37,835
cut incident response times by over 80%.

67
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:44,615
This means fewer manual escalations
and more, reliable operations at scale.

68
00:04:45,115 --> 00:04:48,114
Yes, AI just doesn't detect, data issues.

69
00:04:48,145 --> 00:04:50,155
It also learns from them.

70
00:04:50,484 --> 00:04:55,775
So let's d dive into how machine
learning, plays an important role in this.

71
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:59,864
The integration of, machine learning
in monitoring, systems unlocks

72
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:05,385
unprecedented efficiencies by recognizing,
patterns and predicting failures.

73
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:10,819
Ml, driven systems adapt over time,
refining that accuracy with each

74
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:16,399
incident, so advanced and detection,
and ensures that potential issues are

75
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:22,849
flagged before the impact the users
significantly reducing system disruptions.

76
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:27,749
Now to understand the full impact
of these advancements, let's take

77
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:29,639
a look at some real world numbers.

78
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:34,679
So as you can see on the screen,
organizations implementing automated

79
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:42,019
monitoring solutions report up to five
nines up times, and showing that systems

80
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,879
remain operational around the clock.

81
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:48,729
Manual intervention drops dramatically
with automated remediation, reducing

82
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:55,349
human effort by over 78%, quicker,
response times and AI driven

83
00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:02,219
insights make it teams more effective
while cutting operational course.

84
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:06,669
So for it o. IT professionals
looking to stay ahead.

85
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:09,069
Building hands-on experience is crucial.

86
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:11,949
So let's see how Home
Labs can help in this.

87
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:17,939
for it, it, our professionals Hands-on
Learning is in valuable home labs or

88
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:23,689
provide a risk free environment to master
tools, experiment with configurations and.

89
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:29,689
Similar, the real world incidents
studies show that those who regularly

90
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:33,999
engage with home labs improve
their technical proficiency by over

91
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:39,309
80% as compared to those who rely
solely on the theory based learning.

92
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:45,269
So once we develop skills
and automation, we must also

93
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:46,949
implement strategies correctly.

94
00:06:47,924 --> 00:06:53,145
Now let's discuss the, or discuss the
best approach, approach in doing that.

95
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:57,245
A successful auto commission strategy
requires a structured approach.

96
00:06:57,635 --> 00:07:02,945
So first, conduct a thorough
audit to identify gaps in

97
00:07:02,945 --> 00:07:04,235
existing monitoring framework.

98
00:07:04,835 --> 00:07:12,064
Next, select the right tools tailored
to business needs or pilot deployments.

99
00:07:12,095 --> 00:07:13,025
Allow for it.

100
00:07:13,745 --> 00:07:16,305
Testing before the full-time,
full scale rollout.

101
00:07:17,025 --> 00:07:17,415
Rollout

102
00:07:17,915 --> 00:07:23,725
integration ensures seamless data
exchange across platforms while ongoing

103
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:28,855
optimizations refined our processes
based on performance insights with

104
00:07:28,855 --> 00:07:32,195
a well, planned strategy in place.

105
00:07:32,695 --> 00:07:34,965
Now, let's, let's wrap up with some.

106
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:41,724
Key takeaways, to summarize, automation
is, is the revolutionizing ID operations.

107
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:46,640
it minimizes manual workload,
improves system reliability,

108
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,740
and his operational efficiency.

109
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:55,580
Advance monitoring tools like Prometheus,
Nagios and Datadog enable our.

110
00:07:56,555 --> 00:07:57,935
Enable predictor maintenance.

111
00:07:58,435 --> 00:08:02,785
While AI will power solutions, take
automation to the next level, the key

112
00:08:02,785 --> 00:08:09,525
is structured, deployment and continuous
refinement to maximize impact of finally,

113
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:12,235
or before we conclude, I would love.
