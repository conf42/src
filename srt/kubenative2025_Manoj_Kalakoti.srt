1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,150
Hi myself, Manu I would like to
discuss, speak about autonomous ops

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,900
for cloud native financial services
engineering, cost governance at scale.

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:19,230
So myself I'm manure kako, so I currently
work at a leading global technology

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,570
company where I specialize in customer
electronics and cloud-based services.

5
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:30,765
Where I lead initiatives in site
reliability, engineering and platform

6
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:37,765
automations and cloud cost optimizations
with experience in building, scaling, and

7
00:00:37,825 --> 00:00:40,235
automating cloud native infrastructure.

8
00:00:40,235 --> 00:00:45,785
My expertise with Kubernetes and
CICD cost cloud cost governance

9
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:47,075
and infrastructure code.

10
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:54,250
So with a strong focus on reliability
performance and compliance in high

11
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:59,410
regular, in industries such as
financial services, where I specialized

12
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:05,290
in designing resilient audit ready
platforms and implementing autonomous

13
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:09,840
monitoring for cloud related activities
and remedies for the workflow.

14
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,880
I am presenting this automation finance
for cloud native financial services.

15
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,930
Why I'm presenting this.

16
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,670
So the presentation is about this.

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,570
Financial services are at crossroads.

18
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:27,440
So they are under immense pressure to
modernize with cloud native technologies.

19
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,330
We, while facing raising costs
unpredictability, scaling,

20
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,650
and strict regular demands.

21
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:42,915
So traditional finance ops models are like
largely retrospective and manual, so are

22
00:01:42,915 --> 00:01:47,285
no longer sufficient to keep up with the
speed and complexity of the Kubernetes

23
00:01:47,285 --> 00:01:49,725
space multi-tenant environments.

24
00:01:49,815 --> 00:01:54,855
So as a lead of engineers, so I am.

25
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,009
Working as a DevOps.

26
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:02,369
So I see a an urgent need for
embedding a financial intelligence

27
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:04,899
directly into the engineering cycle.

28
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,960
This session is about showing how
autonomous fan ops with automation

29
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:16,230
and air driven anomaly detection and
policy enforcement and auditory design.

30
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,559
Can deliver a scalable cost governance
without slowing the innovations.

31
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:26,969
Today's agenda is going to be on
the finance service cloud dilemma.

32
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:31,409
So traditional fin financial
operations limitations, platform

33
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:32,789
engineering with finance ops.

34
00:02:33,674 --> 00:02:37,574
And autonomous capabilities and
implementing the blueprints.

35
00:02:38,084 --> 00:02:42,994
As a financial institute modernization
on cloud architectures, right?

36
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:48,184
So the cost governance become
both on regularity requirements

37
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:50,224
as a business imperative.

38
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:56,044
So traditional and manual financial
operation practices cannot keep up Peace.

39
00:02:56,534 --> 00:03:01,624
With dynamic and multi-tenant Kubernetes
environments, unpredictable scaling

40
00:03:01,684 --> 00:03:04,774
and raising cloud provider cost.

41
00:03:05,044 --> 00:03:09,014
And autonomous finance introduced
intelligent automations, right?

42
00:03:09,374 --> 00:03:17,314
So AI driven detection and embedded policy
enforced to deliver real time visibility.

43
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:23,349
And continuous optimization and
audit ready compliance by by

44
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:27,239
integrating the financial control
directly to the development

45
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,359
pipelines and operational workflow.

46
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:33,419
So the financial service and
organization can achieve scalable

47
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:39,749
cost covenants predictability and cost
spent on strong regulatory alignments

48
00:03:40,059 --> 00:03:41,319
without slowing the innovation.

49
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,259
So let's go to the next slide.

50
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:48,849
So this slide is about the like
financial service cloud dilemma.

51
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:54,589
And expand overview on this is so the
financial service cloud dilemma like

52
00:03:54,589 --> 00:04:01,639
financial institutions are accelerating
cloud adoption to modernize services and

53
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:05,629
stay competitive, but face major hurdles.

54
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:10,199
Legacy systems make migration complex
while regulatory demand strict

55
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:12,969
transparency and cost attributes.

56
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:17,219
Multitenant Kubernetes environments
at scalable but complicate

57
00:04:17,219 --> 00:04:18,719
the cost monitoring, right?

58
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:24,039
So especially with unpredictable
scaling driven by the market violations

59
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,439
and raising cost provider cost and.

60
00:04:27,859 --> 00:04:34,339
A, a skill gap in a traditional IT finance
and cloud native operations further

61
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,299
intensify the challenge and unchecked.

62
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:45,049
These urist financial stability and
compliance to succeed institutes

63
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:50,259
must combine real time visibility
automated optimization and strong

64
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:52,569
collaboration between IT finance and.

65
00:04:52,984 --> 00:04:58,244
Compliance teams to balance that
innovation and the cost governance.

66
00:04:58,784 --> 00:05:01,274
So this slide is about acceleration.

67
00:05:01,374 --> 00:05:05,064
Digital transformations while
managing complex legacy systems

68
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:09,764
and, budget constraints,
significant skill gaps complex and

69
00:05:09,764 --> 00:05:13,024
multi-tenant Kubernetes environments
suffering thousands of workload.

70
00:05:13,524 --> 00:05:18,264
So coming to the next slide,
traditional finance is falling behind.

71
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:21,794
I'm gonna discuss about the
reactor analysis disconnected

72
00:05:21,794 --> 00:05:24,164
systems and slow feedback loops.

73
00:05:24,494 --> 00:05:29,204
Traditional finance financial
operation practices are no longer

74
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,484
sufficient for today's cloud native.

75
00:05:31,484 --> 00:05:32,204
Fast moving.

76
00:05:32,724 --> 00:05:34,314
Financial environments, right?

77
00:05:34,524 --> 00:05:41,154
So they rely heavily on reactive
retrospective and cost analysis.

78
00:05:41,394 --> 00:05:46,404
So like reviewing the cloud bills
after the fact rather than providing

79
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:51,544
real time insights disconnected
financial and engineering systems

80
00:05:52,044 --> 00:05:54,754
create operational slowness.

81
00:05:54,934 --> 00:05:59,754
So making it a difficult to align,
speeding with actual workload.

82
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:05,839
As a result, like feedback loops
are slow, often taking weeks to

83
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,779
detect the address cost anomalies.

84
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:11,859
So in highly regulated financial systems.

85
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:15,929
So they delay in more
than budgeting problems.

86
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:21,824
It continues a governance failures
exposing institutions to both

87
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:24,269
financial risks and compliance issues.

88
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:30,359
So the violation of cloud de
developments has outpaced traditional

89
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:34,669
financial operations, living
institute vulnerabilities to cost

90
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:37,909
overrun and regulatory scrutinies.

91
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:43,499
So by the time caused spikes the cost
spike is detected in traditional financial

92
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:44,954
operations, the financial damage.

93
00:06:45,824 --> 00:06:47,764
Is already ineffective.

94
00:06:48,064 --> 00:06:52,004
So in the high regulator
financial sectors, this isn't

95
00:06:52,094 --> 00:06:55,644
the merely a budget concern.

96
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:59,354
It represent significance
a governance failures.

97
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:05,324
So coming to the next slides, we'd like
to discuss about the platform engineering.

98
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,169
And the financial evaluations
from reactive monitoring to

99
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,669
proactive monitoring, right?

100
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:18,759
So reactive monitoring has post factor
cost analysis manual works limited

101
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:22,514
developer bilities, low feedback
on cost anomalies coming to the

102
00:07:22,664 --> 00:07:24,734
practical governance from reactive.

103
00:07:25,384 --> 00:07:29,534
We have in Incre integrated cost
optimizations for software development

104
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:35,664
lifecycle real time automated insights
empower development, manage speed,

105
00:07:35,724 --> 00:07:38,164
and automated anomaly automation.

106
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:43,864
So platform engineering elevates
financial operations from

107
00:07:43,894 --> 00:07:49,484
react to, to proactive focusing
functions to the governance model.

108
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:51,629
Like practical models.

109
00:07:51,989 --> 00:07:56,849
So this ambit across the entire
engineering life cycle start off relying

110
00:07:56,849 --> 00:08:00,704
on cost monitoring and slow workflows.

111
00:08:01,134 --> 00:08:05,654
Financial intelligence is
integrated directly in developing

112
00:08:06,074 --> 00:08:10,924
pipelines are given in real time
automated insights and cost impact.

113
00:08:11,484 --> 00:08:15,974
This approach empowers developers
to manage and optimize optimize

114
00:08:16,024 --> 00:08:20,984
spend a as they build while
automated system remediates

115
00:08:21,044 --> 00:08:23,414
anomalies before they escalates.

116
00:08:23,624 --> 00:08:29,624
So the results is a balance model
where financial institute gains a

117
00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:33,604
ability of cost adoption without
sacrificing the cost control,

118
00:08:34,054 --> 00:08:36,294
compliance, and financial stability.

119
00:08:36,894 --> 00:08:43,484
So unlocking a greater efficient and
predictability and long term value

120
00:08:43,484 --> 00:08:46,124
creation for the evolution process.

121
00:08:46,624 --> 00:08:49,804
So coming to the embedded
financial intelligence.

122
00:08:49,804 --> 00:08:53,944
So here we are gonna discuss
about infrastructure as the code

123
00:08:54,454 --> 00:08:59,104
templates and continuous integration,
continuous deployment, financial gates

124
00:08:59,224 --> 00:09:01,024
Kubernetes administration controls.

125
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,219
And real time telemetry.

126
00:09:03,739 --> 00:09:09,889
Embedded financial intelligence means
building cost awareness and governance

127
00:09:09,939 --> 00:09:12,399
directly into the engineering workflow.

128
00:09:12,909 --> 00:09:19,789
And rather than treating it as a after
true this is achieved through like

129
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:24,469
these four mentioned qualities like
infrastructure as a code templates.

130
00:09:25,124 --> 00:09:27,824
CICD, KU administration,
real time telemetry.

131
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:34,059
So by waiving financial control
into development and deployment

132
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:39,099
process, financial interest can
achieve continuous cost, governance

133
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:45,284
and proactive anomaly detection and
predictability cloud span like all

134
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,804
while maintaining compliance process.

135
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:51,864
So coming to the
pre-deployment cost estimation.

136
00:09:51,904 --> 00:09:55,654
Technical implementations
involves averaging static

137
00:09:55,654 --> 00:09:59,924
analysis for infrastructure as
a code templates for precious.

138
00:10:00,024 --> 00:10:05,454
Our resource cost calculations utilize
historical users datas for accuracy

139
00:10:06,084 --> 00:10:10,494
integrating directly with a cloud provider
like pricing, APIs and realtime stuff.

140
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:16,604
Optimizing costs through reverse instance
and saving like scale down and stuff.

141
00:10:16,694 --> 00:10:21,044
Financial government benefits
includes enabling proactive budgeting

142
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:23,194
validation prior to the development.

143
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:28,434
Providing cost estimation confidence
intervals for better financial planning.

144
00:10:29,034 --> 00:10:33,164
Faculty Accu Curate project
level financial forecasting.

145
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:40,044
Maintain a clear audit trail for cost
of brewers, so pre pre-development,

146
00:10:40,044 --> 00:10:45,444
cost estimate, and based like financial
accountability early in the software or

147
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:51,684
development lifecycle by predicting cost
spend before workloads are launched.

148
00:10:52,024 --> 00:10:55,714
Technically this involves
analyzing infrastructure code.

149
00:10:56,174 --> 00:11:01,135
Templates using historical
usage pattern for high traffic

150
00:11:01,185 --> 00:11:04,175
or high user data patterns.

151
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:09,794
And pulling the real time pricing data
from cloud providers on enterprise cloud

152
00:11:09,824 --> 00:11:12,794
subnets, or to calculate expected costs.

153
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:18,819
Optimizing strategies such as or as
mentioned rivers instance and savings

154
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:21,680
plans further refine these estimations.

155
00:11:22,109 --> 00:11:28,479
For financial governance perspective,
these these enables institutions to

156
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:31,809
validate budgets proactively, right?

157
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:36,794
And produce a confident base
forecasting and maintain an

158
00:11:36,794 --> 00:11:38,834
audit trial to cost approvals.

159
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:45,209
So this results in more predictable
financial planning and reduce

160
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:50,639
their risk to unexpected cl cloud
financial burdens or expenses.

161
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:55,050
Moving on to the slide of
policy-based budgeting gating.

162
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:57,449
Define budget policies.

163
00:11:57,689 --> 00:12:03,339
So I'm gonna is about implementing
enforce points build approval workflow

164
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,800
and create a feedback mechanism.

165
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:14,420
So policy based budget getting enforce
financial guardrails throughout the

166
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,689
software or development pipelines, right?

167
00:12:17,689 --> 00:12:19,490
So by defining.

168
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:26,210
Granular YAML based budgeting pro
policies to the project team, or

169
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:32,660
application level organizations can
ensure spending limits are respected.

170
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:39,390
These policies are enforced at a
critical stage of code commits, bills,

171
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,030
deployments, scaling events to preview.

172
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:47,035
To the previous comments are
reviewing the level of compassion.

173
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:50,665
So to prevent the audit runs
before they occurs, right?

174
00:12:51,025 --> 00:12:55,805
So automated approval workflow
handles exceptionals with proper

175
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,735
authorization and audit logging.

176
00:12:58,455 --> 00:13:04,715
So while real time dashboards are alerts,
provide continuous visibility into the.

177
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,080
Compliance and budget consumption.

178
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:13,930
So this approach ensures cloud
spending stay on predictability avoid

179
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:19,350
cost surprises, and maintain regular
compliance in the financial services.

180
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:25,130
So coming to the next slide, we have
automated tagging and compliance.

181
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,830
So automated tagging and.

182
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,530
Compliance of automated finance.

183
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:37,530
So financial operations ensure
every resource is accurate, tracker

184
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,850
and allocated and completed.

185
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:47,550
So this includes enforcement managed
tag schemas at creation enabling tagging

186
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,725
inheritance to consistent line age.

187
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:56,235
And dynamically applying tags
based on the deployment context.

188
00:13:56,685 --> 00:14:01,175
Tag validation gates with continuous
integration kind deployment pipelines

189
00:14:01,515 --> 00:14:08,135
previously non-compliant deployments
while remediation bots automatically fixes

190
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:12,035
untagged or mist tagged resources, right?

191
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,000
So comprehensive compliant report.

192
00:14:14,805 --> 00:14:21,145
Provider audit readiness, visibility and
accountability, supporting both financial

193
00:14:21,145 --> 00:14:24,635
transparency and regulatory requirements.

194
00:14:25,135 --> 00:14:25,345
Yeah.

195
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:30,265
Coming to the next slide, we are going to
discuss on real time anomaly detection.

196
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:36,055
So this involves time series
analysis, resource fingerprinting.

197
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,900
And cultivation detection
and predictive forecasting.

198
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:49,550
Real time anomalies that users machine
learning to move beyond static alerts

199
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:54,480
and provide adaptive, pro and proactive
monitoring for cloud spanning right

200
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,270
by applying time series analysis.

201
00:14:57,755 --> 00:15:05,035
It identifies Devi station from
historical usage and seasonal trends.

202
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:11,095
Resource fingerprint creates a
behavioral baselines for workloads

203
00:15:11,335 --> 00:15:16,770
while co correlations with detection
line cost spikes for the deployments

204
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,420
and as well as the application
events or external triggers.

205
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,360
So additionally proactive forecasting
projects future costs, right?

206
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,370
So with confidence interval enabling
terms to anticipate issues before

207
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:39,420
they escalate they approach ensure
financial institutes can rapidly detect

208
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,130
it or, they can investigate, right?

209
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,260
And remediate the anomalies.

210
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:50,525
By maintaining cost control,
compliance, and operational stability

211
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:56,145
by maintaining the governance
in dynamic cloud environments.

212
00:15:56,645 --> 00:16:00,795
How like self-healing cost
for remediation works.

213
00:16:01,245 --> 00:16:08,145
So it can help out with anomaly
detection, root cause analysis remediation

214
00:16:08,145 --> 00:16:10,785
workflow, and automated actions.

215
00:16:11,115 --> 00:16:17,725
So typically, self-healing remediation
action includes right size over provision

216
00:16:17,725 --> 00:16:24,345
resources automatically applying these
computer reservation discounts suggesting

217
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,135
and executing storage to your operations.

218
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,950
Recommending face id architectural
changes for sustaining savings.

219
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:39,410
So self-healing cost remediation
represents the next stage of

220
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,340
intelligence financial operations.

221
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,970
So where cloud environments not
only detect the anomalies, but

222
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:50,650
also resolve them automatically
to prevent financial leakages.

223
00:16:51,185 --> 00:16:52,965
And compliance risks.

224
00:16:53,115 --> 00:16:58,815
So the process begins with a machine
learning driven auto anomaly detection

225
00:16:59,215 --> 00:17:05,565
which identifies unusual cost patterns
are policy violations in real time.

226
00:17:06,015 --> 00:17:11,555
So once flagged automated
root cause analysis pinpoints

227
00:17:11,585 --> 00:17:14,105
the exact resource workloads.

228
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:18,380
Or even the deployments
change behind the issues.

229
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:25,770
So based on the severities of the
clarifications a remediation workflow is

230
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,890
triggered using a predefined playbooks.

231
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:35,530
These workflows may execute in
self-service mode or with developer

232
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:41,220
improvements or in a full automated
fashion with approvals And, complete

233
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,890
audit trials to maintain the governance.

234
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:50,220
So these are the common selfish
self-healing action included in the slide.

235
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:57,200
So by by combining AI driven
insights automatic and governance,

236
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:02,520
self-healing remediation allows
financial institutions to continuously

237
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,820
optimize and the cloud environments.

238
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:13,610
That do not only reduce costs, but also
enforce compliance improves predictability

239
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,210
and enhance operational resilience.

240
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,330
Ensuring financial stability
is high, highly dramatic.

241
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:25,850
So they dynamically want to reduce,
regulate the cloud ecosystem.

242
00:18:25,895 --> 00:18:26,405
Oops.

243
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:31,065
So coming to the audit audit
ready infrastructure design.

244
00:18:31,665 --> 00:18:36,725
This eng includes immutable cost
logs metadata governance audit

245
00:18:36,725 --> 00:18:42,335
reporting, so critical capability
providing the financial controls

246
00:18:42,335 --> 00:18:47,625
where enforce consistently across
all cloud resource of at all time.

247
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:52,495
Audit ready infrastructure and financial
operations, financial services.

248
00:18:53,005 --> 00:18:58,685
So in highly regulated financial
environments cloud infrastructure support,

249
00:18:58,715 --> 00:19:01,205
a comprehensive audit or auditability.

250
00:19:01,655 --> 00:19:08,515
And strict fi, financial ance automation,
financial operations solution address.

251
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:12,005
These need to be provided Im immutable.

252
00:19:12,065 --> 00:19:17,435
Cost logs standardization, metadata,
schemas tamper proof recording

253
00:19:17,435 --> 00:19:19,475
for all the financial conditions.

254
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:25,665
Approvals, cost at attributions,
so those system enable automated

255
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:32,325
reporting aligned with regular
frameworks such as GDPX SOX compliance.

256
00:19:32,895 --> 00:19:35,060
PCI compliance DSS.

257
00:19:35,655 --> 00:19:41,485
So ensuring these financial controls
are constantly enforcing across

258
00:19:41,545 --> 00:19:44,075
all cloud resource at all times.

259
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:48,525
Prebuilt reports and structural
governments framework simply

260
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:54,740
compliance reduce the risks and provide
verifiable evidence for the audits.

261
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,640
That helps.

262
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:55,790
Yeah.

263
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:59,770
Coming to the next slide, building
up the financial platform for

264
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,780
technical implementation blueprints.

265
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:07,870
So the core components involves cost
estimations, service integration with

266
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:13,120
infrastructure as code policy engine
for budget enforcement financial,

267
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:19,230
elementary collection and storage machine
learning pipeline for anomaly detection.

268
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,940
Remediation workflow and orchestration.

269
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,520
So integration points involves
but not less than version control,

270
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,960
pre-commit hooks, integration,
energy deployment, pipeline stages.

271
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:39,220
Kubernetes administration controls
cloud provider APIs and even streams

272
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,740
existing observability platforms.

273
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:46,490
Building your financial operation
platform for a technical blueprint

274
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:52,365
is a robust platform financial
operation platform that combines costs,

275
00:20:52,365 --> 00:20:58,205
services, and strategic integrations
to manage cloud cost efficiently.

276
00:20:58,655 --> 00:21:03,875
And core components includes a
cost estimation service integrated

277
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,305
with infrastructure as a code a.

278
00:21:06,845 --> 00:21:11,035
And a policy engine for budget
enforcement as mentioned.

279
00:21:11,455 --> 00:21:16,465
So not only the financial telemetry
collection and storage, but the mission

280
00:21:16,465 --> 00:21:19,685
learning part, anomaly detection pipeline.

281
00:21:20,015 --> 00:21:25,025
So to max the, to maximize impact
organizations should focus on high value

282
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:32,890
integration point points first, and expand
to the platform integr integrations.

283
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:38,490
And to ensure scalable and sustainable
financial operation systems.

284
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:44,330
Coming to the next slide, so we are gonna
discuss about measuring financial success

285
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:51,440
for cost reduction cost predictability
policy compliance and response time.

286
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:56,490
Measuring the financial success
is in financial services, right?

287
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:00,930
So efficiently evaluating the
financial success requires a

288
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:06,220
multi-dimensional approach that
goes beyond simple cost savings.

289
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:12,130
One key metrics is cost reduction, which
measures the quantifiability savings.

290
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,490
But achieving through the autonomous
optimization and intelligent cloud

291
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:23,410
management like also come back to
the traditional manual work manual

292
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:28,940
methods complementing these to a cost
predictability, which tracks percentage

293
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:35,260
to cost spend that constantly aligns
with predefined forecasting range.

294
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:40,985
That enables organizations to plan
budgeting with a greater accuracy

295
00:22:41,135 --> 00:22:43,285
and reduce financial uncertainty.

296
00:22:44,105 --> 00:22:49,235
Another critical measures is policy
compliance where to ensure that all

297
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:54,975
cloud resources are currently tagged and
allocated to the respective cost centers.

298
00:22:55,255 --> 00:22:59,285
This is not only maintains, ad hoc
to the financial governance, but

299
00:22:59,285 --> 00:23:04,265
also provides clear visibility to
audit and regulatory reporting.

300
00:23:05,165 --> 00:23:09,935
Beyond these direct financial
metrics, a successful financial

301
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:14,835
program financial operations
program, I would say also delivers

302
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,665
broader organization value, right?

303
00:23:18,135 --> 00:23:23,215
Improved financial governance
reduced the risks to audit

304
00:23:23,705 --> 00:23:26,965
discrepancies and regular penalties.

305
00:23:27,355 --> 00:23:32,855
So enhanced self-service capabilities,
imports developers to developers

306
00:23:32,855 --> 00:23:38,145
and the cloud team to operate more
efficiently forecasting involving

307
00:23:38,235 --> 00:23:40,215
while maintaining cost discipline.

308
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:46,100
By combining measure measurable
savings and predictable budgeting

309
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,720
and regulatory compliance.

310
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:52,000
Also, I a rapid anomaly response.

311
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:57,010
Organizing these can historically
access the impact of their financial

312
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:02,905
operations initiative and ensure
the cloud investments deliver both.

313
00:24:03,415 --> 00:24:06,965
Finance and the benefits
of the organizations.

314
00:24:07,465 --> 00:24:11,425
Coming to the final
slide on the takeaways.

315
00:24:11,815 --> 00:24:17,815
So the key takeaways are shifting
finance operational lift empower,

316
00:24:17,815 --> 00:24:23,125
engineering automated governance
design to design for the compliance.

317
00:24:23,645 --> 00:24:28,505
Coming to the key takeaways for efficient
financial operations implementation.

318
00:24:29,285 --> 00:24:34,415
So this is important because to
achieve maximum impact for financial

319
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:39,825
operation initiative organizations
must adapt a strategic, proactive

320
00:24:39,825 --> 00:24:44,260
approach that embed financial
intelligence throughout the software.

321
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,300
Delivered life cycle.

322
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:52,540
And shifting financial operations
left insurers the cost valuable and

323
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:57,730
financial controls are integrated
earlier than the expected.

324
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:03,630
So in this development and deployment
process so allowing teams, also

325
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:08,330
allowing teams to anticipate
and migrate cloud spending risks

326
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,560
before they escalate, right?

327
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,800
Also equally important in empowering
engineering teams while self-service

328
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,300
tools and actionable insights are
in action while developers and

329
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:28,770
excuse me, and operations have
ability to make information cost

330
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:34,530
conscious stations without bottleneck
necks and, and other issues.

331
00:25:34,935 --> 00:25:40,085
So organization benefits from
fast innovation cycle improve

332
00:25:40,115 --> 00:25:46,385
accountability and risk reduced for
budget over automating governance.

333
00:25:46,485 --> 00:25:52,045
In other critical is the other critical
pillar for this financial operations

334
00:25:52,045 --> 00:25:57,755
initiative by moving from manual
reviews to automated policy enforcement.

335
00:25:58,115 --> 00:25:59,105
So financial.

336
00:25:59,605 --> 00:26:04,875
Controls can be considerable
applied across all cloud resources

337
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:10,985
at scale reducing human errors and
ensuring compliance with internal

338
00:26:10,985 --> 00:26:13,625
policies and external regulations.

339
00:26:14,435 --> 00:26:21,635
So finally designing for compliance
is essential in regulator industries.

340
00:26:22,085 --> 00:26:28,725
So systems must be architect for
audit readiness with immutable logs

341
00:26:29,085 --> 00:26:34,535
of transparent financial records
and standardized report framework

342
00:26:34,775 --> 00:26:39,945
that demonstrates add all to
regular regulatory requirements.

343
00:26:40,755 --> 00:26:46,915
So by combining proactive cost
management developer empowers automated

344
00:26:46,915 --> 00:26:50,675
governance and compliance focus designs.

345
00:26:51,465 --> 00:26:55,845
Organizations can optimize cost
