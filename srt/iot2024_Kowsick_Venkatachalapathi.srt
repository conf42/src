00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:36,440
This presentation explores the profound
impact of AI and ML on workflow automation

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,790
dwelling into these technologies,
not only automate repetitive tasks,

11
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:46,300
but also enhance the complex decision
making process by learning from data and

12
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:49,009
continuously optimizing the workflow.

13
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:52,314
let's see the introduction of the
workflow automation with AI and ML.

14
00:00:52,814 --> 00:00:56,524
Before that, let's step back and see what
is a traditional, workflow automation.

15
00:00:56,914 --> 00:01:00,914
historically the workflow automation
focused on streamlining the repetitive

16
00:01:00,924 --> 00:01:03,154
task through a rule based system.

17
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:08,854
it like be a business process automation,
case management, decision management.

18
00:01:09,854 --> 00:01:12,554
It's all derived by the
rules, a preset of rules.

19
00:01:12,954 --> 00:01:16,504
this system follows, predefined
parts and request extensive

20
00:01:16,564 --> 00:01:18,454
human oversight for exception.

21
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:25,039
Or complex scenarios while effective
for basic process traditional automation

22
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:27,629
lack adaptability and intelligence.

23
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:33,469
this is when the AI, ML enhanced
the automation flow, where by

24
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:37,219
introducing an adaptive learning
and predictive capabilities, these

25
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:41,989
technologies can analyze the vast
amount of data, identify the patterns

26
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:43,814
and make intelligent decisions.

27
00:01:44,454 --> 00:01:47,854
AI power systems can handle the
complex scenarios, learn from the

28
00:01:47,914 --> 00:01:51,224
past experience and continuously
improve the performance over time.

29
00:01:51,724 --> 00:01:56,274
So the key enhancements, what AI
ML can bring into the intelligent

30
00:01:56,304 --> 00:02:00,674
task management, we can achieve
process optimization and predictive

31
00:02:00,774 --> 00:02:02,874
analytics to workflow automation.

32
00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:07,280
These enhancements enable the system
to prioritize tasks, identify the

33
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,574
bottlenecks, and improve performance.

34
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:13,509
forecast, potential issues
before they occur, the result is

35
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:17,219
more effective, responsive and
intelligent workflow ecosystem.

36
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:21,499
So AI decision powered, making
an automated workflow start from

37
00:02:21,499 --> 00:02:22,829
the data collection process.

38
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,919
AI systems gather and clean
relevant data from various sources,

39
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,379
ensuring high quality of input
for decision making process.

40
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,309
This step involves handling
large volume of structured and

41
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:36,589
unstructured data efficiently.

42
00:02:37,089 --> 00:02:41,949
Often this has been challenged
because there is noise and outliers.

43
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:46,439
Getting the right data for, for
the, preprocessing is more, and the

44
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:50,409
preprocessing is most important task in
any machine learning, in, in, in, Next

45
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:52,509
is the pattern recognition and analysis.

46
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:55,759
machine learning algorithms analyze
the historical data to identify the

47
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,579
pattern trends and correlations.

48
00:02:58,119 --> 00:03:01,769
This insights from the basis
for predictive models and

49
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:02,809
decision making frameworks.

50
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:05,639
Then the model is being constructed.

51
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:09,169
AI uses analyzed data to
create a predictive models.

52
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:13,469
Then, that can forecast outcome
and recommended actions.

53
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:14,029
models.

54
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:18,489
These models continuously learn and
improve their accuracy over the time.

55
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:22,329
Finally, the automated decision
execution based on the predictive

56
00:03:22,339 --> 00:03:28,419
models and predefined criteria,
AI can make and execute decisions

57
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:32,529
automatically, reducing the need for
human intervention in routine processes.

58
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:36,729
So the industry specific applications
of AI decision makings are in

59
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:40,109
various industry and some of
the industries heavily used.

60
00:03:40,504 --> 00:03:45,274
these type of implementations are the
finance, healthcare, manufacturing,

61
00:03:45,504 --> 00:03:46,934
and the retail businesses.

62
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:51,714
So in the finance, let's see how,
these, APower decision making

63
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:54,604
are helping the finance industry,
through a fraud detection.

64
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:58,654
it searches for the transaction
patterns and, user behavior and

65
00:03:58,654 --> 00:04:02,534
historical data to identify the
fraudulent activities in real time.

66
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:07,429
machine learning models can adapt
to a new fraud tactic and tactics

67
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:11,909
improving the detection rates
and reducing false positives.

68
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:17,179
In the healthcare industry, the predictive

69
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:21,799
the patient data, medical history, and
current symptoms to assist in early

70
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:23,729
disease detection and treatment planning.

71
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:28,929
These systems can predict potential
health risk and recommend preventive

72
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,849
measures in the manufacturing.

73
00:04:31,624 --> 00:04:35,774
Supply chain optimization, places and
places in a benefit, machine learning

74
00:04:36,174 --> 00:04:40,014
algorithms optimize supply chain
operations by predicting the demand and

75
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:43,784
identifying the potential disruptions
and recommending the inventory levels.

76
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:48,324
This leads to reduced cost,
improved efficiency, and

77
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,044
enhanced customer satisfaction.

78
00:04:50,544 --> 00:04:55,654

00:05:01,504 --> 00:05:04,784
purchase history, and preferences
to provide a personalized product,

81
00:05:04,854 --> 00:05:08,774
recommendations, and targeted marketing
campaigns, and even enhancing the

82
00:05:08,794 --> 00:05:10,274
engagement and increasing sales.

83
00:05:10,774 --> 00:05:14,184
how the NLP for automated communications,
and the NLP for automated communications.

84
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:19,019
we can bring into the workflow
management, email triage and routing.

85
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,859
as in the, any customer support,
we receive, thousands and thousands

86
00:05:22,859 --> 00:05:27,359
of emails where an LP algorithms
can automatically categorize and

87
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:31,859
prioritize the incoming emails based
on the content center and agency.

88
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:36,299
This enables efficient routing
of messages, appropriate

89
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:38,189
departments or individuals.

90
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:41,334
Reducing the response time and
improving the customer service.

91
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:43,474
The next is the sentiment analysis.

92
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:49,729
AI powered sentiment analysis to tools
can process customer feedback and social

93
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:54,814
media posts and support tickers to gauge
public opinion and customer satisfaction.

94
00:05:55,654 --> 00:06:00,144
This information can be used to trigger
automatic responses or alert human

95
00:06:00,164 --> 00:06:01,974
operators when intervention is needed.

96
00:06:02,474 --> 00:06:05,004
The next is the chat bots
and restore assistance.

97
00:06:05,474 --> 00:06:05,924
Advanced NLP.

98
00:06:06,424 --> 00:06:11,334
enables the creation of intelligent
chatbots and virtual assistants

99
00:06:11,344 --> 00:06:14,894
that can understand and respond
to natural language queries.

100
00:06:15,714 --> 00:06:21,334
These AI driven tools can handle a
routine customer inquiries, schedule

101
00:06:21,384 --> 00:06:24,654
appointments, and even assist with
the complex problem solving tasks.

102
00:06:25,154 --> 00:06:28,994
Okay, let's see how the NLP,
driven task management in workflow.

103
00:06:29,809 --> 00:06:34,449
So the first is the content analysis
NLP algorithm analyze the incoming

104
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:38,559
communications such as email or support
tickets to understand the content,

105
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,509
intent and urgency of each messages.

106
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:47,319
This step involves techniques
like entity organization, topic

107
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:49,989
modeling and intent classification.

108
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:54,389
The next is a task extraction
based on the content of analysis.

109
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,019
The system identifies and extracts
a specific task or action items.

110
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:04,509
For example, it might recognize a
request for a meeting, a deadline for a

111
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:07,979
report, or a need for technical support.

112
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,539
And then the third step is the
prioritization and assignment.

113
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:15,649
The extracted from the extracted
task are automatically prioritized

114
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:19,179
based on the urgency, importance,
and available resources.

115
00:07:20,084 --> 00:07:23,744
The system then assign the task
to the most appropriate team

116
00:07:23,754 --> 00:07:28,534
members or departments taking into
account workload and expertise.

117
00:07:28,534 --> 00:07:35,874
Automator follow ups is the last thing
where the AI system monitor task, task

118
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:40,294
progress since an automator reminders
and escalates the issue when necessary.

119
00:07:40,664 --> 00:07:44,984
It can also generate the
status reports and update state

120
00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:46,644
stakeholders automatically.

121
00:07:47,144 --> 00:07:50,414
Ensuring efficient task
completion and communication.

122
00:07:50,914 --> 00:07:53,954
Okay, so the workflow is
built, but, nothing is perfect

123
00:07:53,954 --> 00:07:55,114
in the first place, right?

124
00:07:55,714 --> 00:07:59,114
And building an adaptive workflow
system with reinforcement

125
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:03,324
learning, is what making the
automated workflow, even smarter.

126
00:08:03,324 --> 00:08:08,704
At the initial stage, the
workflow system starts with a

127
00:08:08,714 --> 00:08:10,624
basic set of rules and process.

128
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:10,684
Thank you.

129
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:14,519
Because it has a limited knowledge
of optimal strategies for different

130
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:17,519
scenarios Next is the exploration phase.

131
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:22,019
The system begins to explore different
actions and decisions within the workflow

132
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:28,319
collecting on the outcomes of each choice
learning and adaption using the reinforced

133
00:08:29,049 --> 00:08:34,109
Learning algorithms the system analyzes
the outcomes of its actions identifying

134
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:39,559
which strategies lead to better results
And next is the policy optimization.

135
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:44,319
The system refines its decision
making process based on learned

136
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:48,319
experiences, continuously improving
its performance over time.

137
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,859
And finally, the continues improvement.

138
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:55,439

171
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:13,709
So the future trend in AI ML
workflow automation are the

172
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:14,479
integration with the IoT.

173
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:19,049
because IOT generates a lot amount
of data and machine learning models

174
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:21,709
requires a lot of data to perform better.

175
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:26,699
The convergence of AI driven workflow
automation and the internet of

176
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:31,939
things, devices will create a highly
responsive data rich ecosystem.

177
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:36,649
from the smart sensors and all connected
devices, will provide a real time

178
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:41,819
data inputs allowing the AI system
to make more informed decisions.

179
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:45,674
Thank you And automate physical processes
in addition to the digital workflows.

180
00:11:46,174 --> 00:11:52,304
Cloud based AI services, the
rise of cloud based AI services

181
00:11:52,334 --> 00:11:56,514
will, democratize the access to
advanced workflow automation tools.

182
00:11:56,744 --> 00:11:59,994
Small and medium sized business
will be able to leverage the

183
00:11:59,994 --> 00:12:03,894
power of AI capabilities without
significant infrastructure

184
00:12:03,904 --> 00:12:08,424
investments, leading to widespread
of adoption across the industries.

185
00:12:08,944 --> 00:12:12,384
of course we, there are some ethical
consideration and challenges, where

186
00:12:12,404 --> 00:12:16,934
the first thing is always the data
privacy and security as the AI systems

187
00:12:16,954 --> 00:12:22,264
handle increasingly sensitive data,
ensuring the robust data privacy and

188
00:12:22,264 --> 00:12:24,194
security measures become crucial.

189
00:12:24,914 --> 00:12:29,984
Organization must implement a strong
encryption access control and compliance

190
00:12:29,984 --> 00:12:34,614
with the regulation like a GDPR to protect
the personal and business information.

191
00:12:35,114 --> 00:12:40,414
And, in many cases there is an algorithmic
biases, that is under fitting or over

192
00:12:40,414 --> 00:12:46,064
15 over fitting model, where a system
can inver, you to, or amplify the

193
00:12:46,064 --> 00:12:48,344
biases present in the training data.

194
00:12:48,704 --> 00:12:54,374
It's essential to regularly audit AI
models for fairness and implement the

195
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,324
techniques to mitigate the biases.

196
00:12:56,889 --> 00:13:00,809
ensuring equitable outcomes
across diverse user groups.

197
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:03,899
Next is the transparency
and explainability.

198
00:13:04,219 --> 00:13:09,139
As AI systems make more critical
decisions, the need for transparency

199
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:10,999
and explainability grows.

200
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:15,909
Developing the interpretable AI model
and providing a clear explanation

201
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:20,189
for automated decisions will be
crucial for building the trust and

202
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:21,889
meeting the regulatory requirements.

203
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:22,354
Thank you for joining us.

204
00:13:23,194 --> 00:13:25,194
Finally, the work for, workforce impact.

205
00:13:25,224 --> 00:13:29,824
The increasing automation of workflow
may lead to, job displacement in some

206
00:13:29,824 --> 00:13:31,834
sectors, organization and policy.

207
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:35,884
MA makers must address this challenge
by focusing on reskilling and

208
00:13:35,884 --> 00:13:40,664
upskilling programs, ensuring, that
the workflow workforce can adopt a

209
00:13:40,664 --> 00:13:43,364
new roles in an AI driven economy.

210
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,224
And, thanks for joining this presentation.

211
00:13:46,274 --> 00:13:47,354
hope you learn something.

212
00:13:47,454 --> 00:13:48,864
and I'll see you next time.

213
00:13:49,194 --> 00:13:49,524
