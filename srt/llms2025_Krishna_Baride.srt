1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,050
Greetings, everyone.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:09,450
This is Krishna, and today we are
diving into how AI is not just

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,750
changing, but transforming the
product lifecycle management.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,690
Think of it less as a technical
upgrade and more like giving

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,090
your PLMA superpower AI break.

6
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:29,620
Systems and lead into a future
where innovation is faster,

7
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,740
smarter, and more efficient.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,310
So, what's PLM?

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:42,150
What really it is, it's a story of a
product from its first spark of an idea.

10
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,470
Retirement as.

11
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,830
Is the backbone of product
development, integrating people,

12
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,700
data processes, and business systems.

13
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,380
Imagine you are building
a complex machine.

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,830
PM is the blueprint that guides
every step from the initial

15
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:11,050
sketch to the final assembly,
and even to how your you service.

16
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,780
The aftermarket part of it.

17
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,940
Now let's talk about the challenges
many of us are dealing with,

18
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,080
what I like to call as a legacy.

19
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,895
The document here highlights
the understanding of legacy a.

20
00:01:28,395 --> 00:01:33,555
Let's think it this way to inherit
a house with a complex plumbing

21
00:01:33,555 --> 00:01:36,215
system, but no one left you a map.

22
00:01:36,715 --> 00:01:41,965
You find files are going in all
directions, some are disconnected,

23
00:01:42,355 --> 00:01:47,245
some are leaking, and you are dealing
with a situation, something similar

24
00:01:47,245 --> 00:01:50,745
to, legacy PLM, can feel like.

25
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:56,165
The document also mentions the difficulty
of tracing an engineering change order.

26
00:01:56,665 --> 00:02:01,524
So just think you're trying to
recall a change that you have made

27
00:02:01,885 --> 00:02:07,415
to a product to a complex machine
10 years back with records scattered

28
00:02:07,565 --> 00:02:09,785
across different departments.

29
00:02:10,265 --> 00:02:13,715
Some in paper, some in software.

30
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,000
It's like trying to piece.

31
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,420
Together a puzzle with
missing pieces into it.

32
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,270
These issues lead to errors,
delays, and it's mainly because of

33
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,340
the undocumented travel knowledge.

34
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,925
Have you ever had a situation
where only person who knew

35
00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:36,055
how to fix a critical issue.

36
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,480
awards on a vacation and
no one else had a clue.

37
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,700
That's the tribal knowledge that's
in action, and it's a huge, big

38
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,239
risk, especially in the product
development, product management, area.

39
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,569
Now let's see how AI shines here.

40
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:59,569
It's like bringing an expert
plumber with a digital map.

41
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:05,999
Tools to fix, that complex
AI can help us analyze,

42
00:03:06,499 --> 00:03:09,399
making them and efficient.

43
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:13,679
It can also help us the,
that we providing a.

44
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:15,949
Why, when was it approved?

45
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:21,789
What change was made from one
change order region to next region?

46
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:23,354
it's clearly traceable.

47
00:03:23,854 --> 00:03:26,659
It can capture the tribal
knowledge turning into

48
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:30,859
accessible and searchable data.

49
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:33,699
Now let's talk about some of the benefits.

50
00:03:34,484 --> 00:03:39,744
Benefits of, the artificial
intelligence, the real world wind.

51
00:03:39,744 --> 00:03:42,114
That's what we call document mentions.

52
00:03:42,114 --> 00:03:48,624
Here, the AI powered PLN solutions
are projected to reduce time to

53
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:55,664
market by 30% while improving the
product quality metrics by up to 35%.

54
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:58,414
Lemme give you a reliable example.

55
00:03:58,914 --> 00:04:01,854
Imagine you are developing
a new smartphone.

56
00:04:02,354 --> 00:04:08,864
Traditionally, you have teams working in
silos, passing information back and forth.

57
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:16,874
With ai, you can have a centralized
system that and allows the data from

58
00:04:16,874 --> 00:04:22,664
all stages of development identify
the potential issues earlier.

59
00:04:23,214 --> 00:04:27,204
you can catch design flaws before
they reach to manufacturing,

60
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,054
saving time and money and effort.

61
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:35,154
Another, relatable example is
the predictive maintenance.

62
00:04:35,844 --> 00:04:42,444
Imagine a wind turbine with sensors
connected to an AI powered system.

63
00:04:42,944 --> 00:04:47,344
The AI analyze data predict when.

64
00:04:48,049 --> 00:04:54,999
It's likely to gonna fail alarming or
proactive maintenance and preventing

65
00:04:54,999 --> 00:05:00,734
the cost of downtime and any unwanted,
loss of efforts and applications.

66
00:05:01,244 --> 00:05:01,464
no.

67
00:05:01,464 --> 00:05:06,719
Let's talk about, let's talk about
the implementation strategies.

68
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:10,999
How do we bring these vision in life?

69
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:14,854
Start with the small and focused projects.

70
00:05:15,154 --> 00:05:22,714
Identify the areas where AI can have
the biggest impact and build from there.

71
00:05:23,644 --> 00:05:26,614
Remember, it is not about technology.

72
00:05:26,614 --> 00:05:27,604
It's about people.

73
00:05:28,104 --> 00:05:33,024
In training and chain management
to ensure everyone is on board,

74
00:05:33,114 --> 00:05:38,034
essentially addressing the organizational
transformation or chain management,

75
00:05:38,494 --> 00:05:43,144
challenges here, and of course the
data security is most important.

76
00:05:43,234 --> 00:05:44,134
It's paramount.

77
00:05:44,884 --> 00:05:48,004
Implement the robust data
protection frameworks and.

78
00:05:48,504 --> 00:05:51,194
And conduct regular security, audits.

79
00:05:51,764 --> 00:05:55,574
Also, the emphasis is on
maintaining the ethical standards.

80
00:05:56,114 --> 00:06:00,134
And of course, the data
security comes along with that.

81
00:06:00,634 --> 00:06:01,959
So let's talk about, how.

82
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:07,349
Some of the key studies that we have here,
for example, Boeing, one of the leading

83
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:14,459
aircraft manufacturer maintenance company
through AI driven, PLM, the process around

84
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:20,924
two terabytes of data from their sensors
across more than thousand aircraft flake.

85
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:28,229
And, with that, they achieved a 35%
reduction in unplanned maintenance and

86
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:32,639
also the decrease in the part replacement
cough because, upfront, proactively,

87
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,579
what's gonna happen, where things
can go wrong, where things can fail,

88
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:38,734
and the proactive maintenance helps.

89
00:06:39,284 --> 00:06:42,644
to reduce the maintenance and component.

90
00:06:43,144 --> 00:06:46,380
Similarly, Tesla, they,
they use, AI power.

91
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,244
Is reducing the downtime line by 40% and

92
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,675
cost and a.

93
00:06:54,175 --> 00:06:57,774
No, definitely the future
of AI is, is very strong, is

94
00:06:57,774 --> 00:07:00,239
very prosperous, with ai, you.

95
00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:05,059
So these air power digital pins,
you can simulate the product

96
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:09,044
behavior, with the 99% accuracy.

97
00:07:09,044 --> 00:07:13,814
for example, when you manufacture a car,
an airplane, you create, the models,

98
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:17,444
you do some tests and see how it works.

99
00:07:17,444 --> 00:07:18,404
But with these.

100
00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:21,009
Digital pins, you don't need to do that.

101
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:25,749
You can create the virtual models,
try do some tests, validations,

102
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:29,590
and which are like 99%, accurate.

103
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:30,705
Accurate.

104
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,224
And also this AI powered.

105
00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:37,985
Solutions will are giving you operative
maintenance and automated design

106
00:07:38,345 --> 00:07:43,385
that is helping you to optimize
and make your supply chain more

107
00:07:43,385 --> 00:07:45,965
intelligent and more, more powerful.

108
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:51,075
And at the same time, there are
some widespread challenges we

109
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:54,710
have seen in the industry, like
data quality and integration.

110
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:56,525
Have legacy systems.

111
00:07:56,705 --> 00:07:59,765
Data model that you have for the
legacy systems may be different

112
00:07:59,765 --> 00:08:01,535
from the modern systems.

113
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:06,815
For example, the mismatch between bill
of materials formats, the data models

114
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:12,455
between your PLM systems and say for
example, your ER PSAP system can lead

115
00:08:12,455 --> 00:08:18,620
to a, decrease in, accuracy and even,
it'll the cross function collaboration

116
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,970
between engineering and procurement.

117
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,600
Another important factor is a skill gap.

118
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,980
We need a person who understands
PLM and as well as the artificial

119
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,440
inclusion AI technologies.

120
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,820
This gap is evident.

121
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,330
It's difficult to find such
professionals, and that's one of the

122
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,410
challenge in adopting AI for PLM.

123
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,355
The other factor is the
implementation cost.

124
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:43,065
Implementation cost is very high.

125
00:08:43,335 --> 00:08:46,245
It varies between $500 to $5 million.

126
00:08:46,655 --> 00:08:51,355
and of, and often justifying that
initial investment in infrastructure

127
00:08:51,415 --> 00:08:53,595
and licenses, is always a, challenge.

128
00:08:54,505 --> 00:08:56,690
Another thing is the perceived complex.

129
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,880
May not.

130
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,840
Recommended, options, AI
recommended, opportunities while

131
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,760
making a critical decision.

132
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,640
So these are some of the challenges,
you need to keep in mind while

133
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:14,200
adopting AI in, in, in, in p and m
in general, the future looks bright.

134
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:18,100
AI is not just a tool, it's catalyst.

135
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,270
Break free from the limitations of the
past and build a future where innovation

136
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,750
is faster, smarter, and more sustainable.

137
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,720
So with this, future is
definitely bright and, looking

138
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:33,970
for your comment and feedback.

139
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:34,150
Thank.
