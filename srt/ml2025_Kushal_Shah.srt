1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,170
Good morning, good afternoon,
good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,770
I'm k Sha a data management
professional with over 15 years

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,630
of experience in data governance,
architecture, and business intelligence.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,430
Today, I'll walk you through how we
implemented a scalable, secure, and

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,480
compliance data governance framework
for multi-tenant cloud environment.

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,540
This isn't just about meeting regulatory
requirement, but it's about building a

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,880
system that evolves with your business.

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,060
We face three core challenges, data
isolation, ensuring each tenant

9
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:44,570
data is segregated while enabling
the cross cross system and while

10
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:46,310
enabling the shared analytics.

11
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,280
Regulatory complexity.

12
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,430
Keeping up with the evolving laws
like GDPR, hipaa CCPA across different

13
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,730
regions and operational efficiencies.

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,900
Maintaining strong controls
without slowing down authorized

15
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,580
access or performance.

16
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,210
We needed a solution that made
governance seamless and not bottleneck.

17
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,375
These weren't theoretical problems.

18
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,610
Our cloud infrastructure team
in North America flagged only

19
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,610
issue with data boundaries.

20
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,940
The legal team in Europe
surface compliance gaps

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,790
and DevOps in Asia Pacific.

22
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,090
Raised concern about security
slowing down deployment.

23
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,015
This global visibility helps
shape a framework that is both

24
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,615
comprehensive and flexible.

25
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,030
We structured our governance
framework around three pillars,

26
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,340
tenant specific controls.

27
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:54,300
So each organization defines its
own security posture, secure data

28
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,280
architecture, with role level
security and tenant of encryptions

29
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:06,000
reselling cloud infrastructure
designed for redundancy and skill.

30
00:02:06,975 --> 00:02:12,945
This allowed us to embed governance
directly into the system systems

31
00:02:12,945 --> 00:02:15,015
design, not vault in later

32
00:02:16,015 --> 00:02:19,855
data isolation strategies to
isolate tenant data effectively.

33
00:02:20,635 --> 00:02:26,225
We use role level security in shared
environment, ensuring that the data

34
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:28,085
access is restricted by default.

35
00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:31,895
Each tenant sensitive
information is encrypted.

36
00:02:31,895 --> 00:02:36,455
Using dedicated keys, ensuring
data remains unreadable,

37
00:02:36,515 --> 00:02:38,315
even to privileged users.

38
00:02:38,315 --> 00:02:44,135
And we invented ownership
metadata into every data element.

39
00:02:44,225 --> 00:02:47,855
Enforcing dynamic access
policy, systemwide.

40
00:02:49,505 --> 00:02:54,965
This gave a strong separation without
sacrificing performance and accessibility.

41
00:02:55,965 --> 00:03:01,785
Automated compliance engine, we built a
compliance engine that works continuously

42
00:03:01,785 --> 00:03:03,765
and not just in the audit time.

43
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:11,415
It monitors for discrepancy in real
time, validate regulatory compliance,

44
00:03:11,835 --> 00:03:14,265
and alerts teams for potential.

45
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:15,690
Violations.

46
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:22,170
More importantly, it remediates
automatically triggering

47
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,950
corrective workflows and
documenting the every action.

48
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,311
This approach eliminates
manual gaps and allows us to

49
00:03:32,415 --> 00:03:35,345
respond before issue escalates.

50
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,230
Our security model is built in
layers, starting with identity

51
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:49,020
access management, using multifactor
authentication and clear defined rules.

52
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:54,675
Then data protection with
masking and tokenization for

53
00:03:54,915 --> 00:03:58,095
sensitive fill and transport.

54
00:03:58,425 --> 00:04:04,305
Transport encryptions sec secures
all data in motion while at raised

55
00:04:04,305 --> 00:04:10,665
encryption insurers long-term protection
with distributed key management.

56
00:04:12,075 --> 00:04:17,535
This layer strategy ensures that even if
one barrier fails, other stands ready.

57
00:04:18,535 --> 00:04:22,255
Operating globally means
being flexible by design.

58
00:04:23,755 --> 00:04:28,915
We route data according to jurisdictional
boundaries and apply region specific

59
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:31,390
retention and data deletion policies.

60
00:04:33,415 --> 00:04:38,215
Our documentation system create
audit ready reports that align with

61
00:04:38,305 --> 00:04:41,245
multiple standards simultaneously.

62
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:48,040
This let us stay compliant
without having to rebuild process.

63
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,710
Every time a regulation changes,

64
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:57,500
comprehensive audit capabilities, we
make sure every user action and the

65
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,720
data movement is fully traceable.

66
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:07,010
Every access is logged, including
who, what, when, and why.

67
00:05:08,585 --> 00:05:14,075
All contracts and data modifications
are version control for accountability.

68
00:05:15,755 --> 00:05:21,725
Data exports are tracked and
anomalies triggered alerts for

69
00:05:21,725 --> 00:05:30,065
investigation I this will trust
both internally and with regulators.

70
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:33,525
Let's look at what change
after implementation.

71
00:05:34,905 --> 00:05:39,855
A 40% drop in compliance
violation across several regions.

72
00:05:41,355 --> 00:05:45,705
30% improvement in operational
efficiency through automation.

73
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:53,235
65 reduction in the audit cycle time,
freeing up both legal and IT teams,

74
00:05:54,075 --> 00:06:00,435
and 99.9% system up time proving that
protection and performance can coexist.

75
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:06,450
These gains were achieved through
phase rollout and ongoing refinements.

76
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,420
Here is how our implementation
roadmap looked like.

77
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:17,230
We started with the assessment
where we map existing gaps and risk.

78
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,270
Then we, the data governance
architecture tailored to our

79
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,730
business and regulatory profile.

80
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:31,735
Build configured role-based
access encryption layers and

81
00:06:31,735 --> 00:06:35,845
compliance automation and deploy.

82
00:06:37,885 --> 00:06:44,035
Rolled out gradually across
functions and regions, constantly

83
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,225
measuring and tuning along the way.

84
00:06:47,815 --> 00:06:53,065
This method ensured adoption,
stability and continuous improvement.

85
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:54,605
To close.

86
00:06:54,605 --> 00:06:57,245
Here are four co core takeaways.

87
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:04,535
Complete tenant isolation achieved
through layered controls and encryptions.

88
00:07:06,785 --> 00:07:12,270
Automated compliance achieved through
by eliminating human error and delays

89
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,970
and business agility with.

90
00:07:17,865 --> 00:07:20,655
Governance that doesn't slow teams down.

91
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:28,035
Scalability allowing us to grow from
thousand to tens of thousands of users

92
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:30,345
with zero degradation and integrity.

93
00:07:31,965 --> 00:07:38,085
We built a governance foundation that is
not just secure it, it's built to last.

94
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:40,375
Thank you again for your time.
