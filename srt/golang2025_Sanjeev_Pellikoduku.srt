00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,860
Hello, my name is Sanjay.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,710
I'm honored to be part of con,

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,175
so today I'm presenting
integration cloud computing.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,490
So especially challenges,
solutions and ethical frameworks.

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,680
So the fusion of artificial
intelligence with cloud computing

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,880
is transforming industries
globally, creating unprecedented

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,680
opportunities and challenges.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,305
So with AI cloud market growth,
reaching 11.2 billion in 23

9
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:36,545
and growing at 35.6% annually.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,750
So organizations are rapidly
adopting these technologies.

11
00:00:40,305 --> 00:00:44,715
So this presentation explores the
key challenges ordinations face when

12
00:00:44,715 --> 00:00:49,545
integrating AI with cloud systems
provides evidence-based solutions to

13
00:00:49,545 --> 00:00:56,325
overcome these barriers, and emphasize
the importance of ethical frameworks

14
00:00:56,475 --> 00:00:59,445
in ensuring sustainable growth,

15
00:01:03,315 --> 00:01:06,710
the key challenges of our secondary
challenges in AI cloud system.

16
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:12,075
The security stands as the
foremost obstacle to widespread

17
00:01:12,645 --> 00:01:14,835
a adoption in cloud environments.

18
00:01:15,735 --> 00:01:16,140
So, yeah.

19
00:01:16,335 --> 00:01:21,315
Yeah, allowing 18% of our nations
have experienced SA security

20
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:25,665
instance while 78% struggle with
data privacy vulnerabilities,

21
00:01:26,025 --> 00:01:30,255
particularly when sensory information
is processed by AI systems in cloud.

22
00:01:31,185 --> 00:01:34,305
So the risk landscape is
further complicated by.

23
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:40,770
The fact that 71% of our nation lack
sufficient automated securely tools

24
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,710
to address these threats effectively.

25
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,530
So the model production emerges as
another critical vulnerability with

26
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,714
65% of our nations reporting concerns.

27
00:01:54,675 --> 00:02:01,035
These valuable AI assets become
suspectable to theft, reverse engineering,

28
00:02:01,335 --> 00:02:07,005
and sophisticated adverse attacks
when deployed in cloud environments.

29
00:02:07,365 --> 00:02:11,985
Meanwhile, 42% of our
nations face complaints.

30
00:02:11,985 --> 00:02:15,915
Violence is highlighting that,
regulatory challenges that the

31
00:02:15,915 --> 00:02:18,285
company AA cloud integration.

32
00:02:18,975 --> 00:02:19,515
So coming to.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,670
Solution advanced production mechanisms.

34
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,770
So with the mplementation of homomorphic
encryption enables AI systems to process

35
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,140
fully encrypted data without decryption

36
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,200
preserving privacy toward the
entire computational pipeline.

37
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:43,045
So this breakthrough technology
has demonstrated a 92% direction

38
00:02:43,145 --> 00:02:48,725
in privacy breaches violating
sensor data in ex exposure duty.

39
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,250
Processing cycles.

40
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,010
The next secure entails establishes
hardware isolated execution

41
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,990
environments for AI workloads,
safeguarding both proprietary

42
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,570
models and the data being analyzed.

43
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,070
So organization implementing secure
and clear architecture report.

44
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:15,870
And exceptional 99.99% effectiveness
rate in defending air models diagnos

45
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,299
against sophisticated adverse attacks.

46
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:24,540
So with federated learning facilitators,
distributed model training across

47
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:30,510
decentralized device without consolidating
since two data in cloud repositories.

48
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,780
So this innovative approach has decreased
data vulnerability exposure by 87%.

49
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,970
While maintaining model performance
within 3% of traditional

50
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,070
centralized training methodologies.

51
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,900
So these sophisticated security
frameworks directly addresses the

52
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:55,050
most significant vulnerabilities in AI
cloud integration ecosystem, empowering

53
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,285
automations to deploy advanced data
systems with enhanced confidence under

54
00:03:59,595 --> 00:04:02,005
streamlined regulatory compliance.

55
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,579
The next challenge, operational
complexities in a cloud systems.

56
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:15,869
So, so the operate op operational
complexity, especially with

57
00:04:15,869 --> 00:04:17,459
the integration challenges.

58
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,250
So 82% of enterprise and quantums
sustainable technical debt when

59
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,780
matching legacy systems with cutting
edge, a cloud zone resulting.

60
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:33,825
In extended timelines and compromise
scalability potential, the next market,

61
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:40,575
64% of organizations face significant
hurdles in tracking AI model performance

62
00:04:40,755 --> 00:04:46,905
across distributed cloud environments,
so leading to diminish service quality

63
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:50,265
and undetected drift over time.

64
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:56,870
The next deployment barriers
seven 3% of DevOps teams in.

65
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,790
And maintaining consistent deployment
pipelines for AI workloads in

66
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,890
complex multi-cloud ecosystems.

67
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,980
So, so the operational complexities
are orchestrated AI within

68
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,820
cloud environments, transfer and
initial implementation hurdles.

69
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,475
Organizations must navigate
ongoing integration challenges,

70
00:05:19,825 --> 00:05:23,940
sophisticated monitoring requirements,
and deployment complexities.

71
00:05:23,955 --> 00:05:29,835
That collectively have the full
realization of as transformative

72
00:05:29,835 --> 00:05:32,294
potential in business operations.

73
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:39,315
So the operational solution,
streamlining a AI cloud integration.

74
00:05:40,784 --> 00:05:45,680
So implementing service mesh
just delivers a 92% implement in

75
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,805
service discovery, liability, and
reduces interservice communication.

76
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:52,365
LA Agency by 78.

77
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,109
For AI workloads.

78
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,719
So this sophisticated approach establishes
a dedicated infrastructure layer that top

79
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:07,200
images and secure all service to service
communications within AI cloud ecosystem.

80
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,479
The next monitoring automations,
leveraging AI systems to monitor

81
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,669
the air deployment experience.

82
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:21,840
A 43% reduction in operational cost
alongside 67% faster anomaly detection.

83
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,570
So this intelligent meta AI system
practically identify performance

84
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,669
degradation and model drift patterns
before they impact production

85
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:34,979
environments on end users.

86
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,120
Next.

87
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:42,359
Infrastructure As Code ISC, the
Enterprise Enterprises implementing ISC

88
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:48,090
pathologies for AI deployments achieve
1800% faster provisioning cycles and

89
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,760
reduce configuration errors by 64%.

90
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:57,090
So this programmatic approach enables
consistence, reproducible, and virtual

91
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,890
control deployments across heterogeneous
cloud environments, eliminating

92
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,099
manual configuration inconsistencies.

93
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:10,395
So these strategic operational
solutions directly address the

94
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:15,675
fundamental challenges of managing
AA within cloud ecosystems.

95
00:07:16,425 --> 00:07:20,505
Empowering organizations, so,
uh, empowering organizations to

96
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:24,795
achieve unprecedented level of
reliability, operational efficiency,

97
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:31,005
and seamless scalability throughout
their AA deployment lifecycle.

98
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,770
The next ethical considerations
in EA cloud company computing,

99
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,390
especially there are some fairness.

100
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,650
The transparency.

101
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,260
Transparency in addition, making the
environmental impact, the privacy

102
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,550
of sense to get out Accountability.

103
00:07:49,815 --> 00:07:53,415
So the ethical dimensions of air
deployment in cloud environments

104
00:07:53,655 --> 00:07:59,415
transfer via technical considerations,
so organizations that neglect robust

105
00:07:59,535 --> 00:08:04,335
ethical frameworks, risk implementing
systems that discriminate against

106
00:08:04,665 --> 00:08:12,495
vulnerable populations, compromise
personal privacy or function as black.

107
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,945
IMP black boxes.

108
00:08:15,975 --> 00:08:18,495
That meaningful scrutiny.

109
00:08:20,925 --> 00:08:24,765
Addressing these ethical challenges
represents not only a moral

110
00:08:25,425 --> 00:08:29,775
imperative, but increasingly a
strategic business necessity.

111
00:08:30,615 --> 00:08:36,409
As regulatory landscapes evolve on
stakeholder expectations, mature

112
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:42,250
organizations that prioritize responsibly
a practices gain complicated advantages.

113
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:49,130
Through enhance trust, reduce
reduced competencies and sustain

114
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,090
social license to operate.

115
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,490
So coming to ethical Solutions
framework for responsibility.

116
00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:05,890
So automation, implementing systematic
bias testing across diverse demographic

117
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:12,410
groups have achieved percent in
metrics on 56% reduction financially.

118
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:15,555
Discriminate outcomes, an extra.

119
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:20,535
The expandable ai, the implementation
of cybersecurity XIA techniques has

120
00:09:20,655 --> 00:09:26,325
an enhanced model transparency by
87% and elevated user trust by 64%.

121
00:09:26,955 --> 00:09:27,255
Right?

122
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:34,335
So ethical review boards, the company's
established dedicated cross-functional

123
00:09:34,395 --> 00:09:40,220
a ethics committees demonstrate
net 0.8% regulatory complaints.

124
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,530
And experienced 70% fewer public
relations channels related to AI planets.

125
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,590
So a robust ethical framework seamlessly
integrates technical safeguards with

126
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,690
comprehensive governance structure
to ensure responsibly AI deployment

127
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,820
throughout the entire lifecycle.

128
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,215
So organizations that strategically
prioritize ethical considerations,

129
00:10:06,435 --> 00:10:08,895
not only mitigate operational under.

130
00:10:09,585 --> 00:10:17,565
Reputational risks, but circulate
to it, but also cultivate

131
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:21,915
enduring trust with customers,
partners, regulators, and product

132
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:29,985
case study, the financial services AI
cloud transformation with challenge.

133
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:38,025
So entire global bank struggled with a 43%
increase in sophisticated fraud attacks.

134
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:43,230
Awis average customer
response, strength on demand

135
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:51,329
regulatory, their fragmented legacy
and vouchers could not support

136
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:56,160
advanced AMLs without exposing critical
vulnerabilities in data production.

137
00:10:56,704 --> 00:10:57,685
So implementation.

138
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,449
So the bank are, uh, zero.

139
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,045
Trust A cloud platform incorporated.

140
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,449
It's one 40 MOREOR encryption for real
time data analysis without decryption,

141
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,849
so it still service for service.

142
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:19,050
Secure microservices, orchestration
and and ethical a governance framework

143
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:24,420
with automated data objection across
37 demographic variables, which results

144
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:31,740
fraud detection accuracy improved by 18%
while reducing false false tools by 60%.

145
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:41,595
Customer response times drop from
to two minutes and page 19.7 bucks.

146
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:46,845
So the bank actually a validated
2 87 within three years while

147
00:11:46,845 --> 00:11:51,970
maintaining technic a transparency
scores about industry benchmarks.

148
00:11:53,115 --> 00:11:57,015
So this transformation creates how
financial institutions can effectively

149
00:11:57,015 --> 00:11:58,515
navigate the complex challenges of.

150
00:11:59,295 --> 00:12:03,105
AI Cloud integrations while
simultaneously addressing security

151
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:07,574
vulnerabilities, operational
inefficiencies and ethical considerations.

152
00:12:08,385 --> 00:12:13,125
So by implementing a comprehensive
technical and governance approach, the

153
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:19,305
bank not only delivered quantifiable
performance implements, but also

154
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:24,550
strengthen the customer trust,
established a and established a leadership

155
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:27,870
position in responsible AI deployment.

156
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,060
Future trends in integration.

157
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:38,520
So quantum AI computing, so quantum
computing will fundamentally transform

158
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:43,290
AI capabilities by tracking complex
problems on unprecedented speeds by the

159
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:47,579

162
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,140
Edge Cloud hybrid models.

163
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:04,590
A seamless integration between edge
and cloud AI process is creating

164
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:08,100
distributed intelligence networks
without additional borders.

165
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:13,020
So organizations implementing Edge
Cloud hybrid architecture experience 6%

166
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:19,440
latency and power conversion, augmenting
centralized management capabilities.

167
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,170
The next self-improving a s systems.

168
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,690
So the emergence of AA systems
capable of autonomously enhancing data

169
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:34,350
algorithms and that are shipped in
Comput, early prototypes have proven

170
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:39,030
their ability to optimize cloud resource
location of percent percent more

171
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:42,360
effectively than export human engineers.

172
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,165
So these transformative trends will
reshape the AI cloud ecosystems.

173
00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:53,415
Unlocking unprecedented opportunities
