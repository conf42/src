00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,310
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,370
Thanks for joining my session.

3
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:09,710
I'm UD Na Moham, and today's topic on my
session is AI Powered Knowledge Systems

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,900
for Resilient Cloud Incident Response.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,200
Today's presentation focuses on the
evolving challenges of cloud reliability

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,660
and how modern engineering teams.

7
00:00:20,425 --> 00:00:25,885
Can adapt their incident response
and knowledge management strategies.

8
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:30,735
As organization embrace digital
transformation, the way engineering

9
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:32,750
teams operate has changed dramatically.

10
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:38,470
Cloud native architectures built
on microservices, containers and

11
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:44,169
serverless technologies have introduced
new layers of complexity and failures

12
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:50,999
that simplified did not, or simply
doesn't exist in traditional systems.

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:57,299
At the same time, deployment velocity has
accelerated with many teams pushing codes

14
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:58,679
into production multiple times a day.

15
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:03,769
This creates a high pressure
environment where reliability must be

16
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:06,530
maintained despite constant change.

17
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:11,539
The challenge is that most incident
response frameworks were designed

18
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:15,350
for slower moving monolithic systems.

19
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:20,860
They're not equipped to handle
the speed and the scale of

20
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,800
today's cloud native environments.

21
00:01:24,745 --> 00:01:28,675
And with the growing shortage
of experienced engineers, we

22
00:01:28,675 --> 00:01:33,205
cannot rely solely on tribal
knowledge to solve problems.

23
00:01:33,705 --> 00:01:40,485
We need scalable, intelligent systems that
support fast effective incident resolution

24
00:01:41,054 --> 00:01:43,274
and knowledge sharing across teams.

25
00:01:43,774 --> 00:01:47,315
And because of that we have
many challenges and one of

26
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,625
them is knowledge Half-life.

27
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:55,704
Charlie, this challenge modern
engineering organization on the rapid

28
00:01:55,704 --> 00:02:00,555
DK of technical knowledge, the knowledge
half-life refers to the diminishing

29
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:04,845
relevance of information about a
particular technology or a system

30
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:06,945
over time, often becoming obsolete.

31
00:02:07,445 --> 00:02:10,804
Or significantly less useful
within a short period.

32
00:02:11,304 --> 00:02:13,824
There are specifically three challenges.

33
00:02:14,454 --> 00:02:20,514
One is accelerating innovation
where cloud providers constantly

34
00:02:20,964 --> 00:02:27,435
introduce new services, features
altering how existing systems behave

35
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:29,989
and generate novel failure modes.

36
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:32,469
And then there is a cascading complexity.

37
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:38,079
Even with minor changes can
impact multiple system components,

38
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,969
necessities, extensive adjustments
to monitoring, altering deployment

39
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:45,339
scripts and operational procedures.

40
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,954
And the third one is continuous delivery.

41
00:02:48,045 --> 00:02:54,515
Agile practices accelerate system
change, frequency rendering,

42
00:02:54,515 --> 00:02:55,835
troubleshooting expertise.

43
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:02,570
Obsolete within months due to frequent
updates and architectural shifts.

44
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,630
Implication of knowledge dq
The accelerating knowledge.

45
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,330
Half-life extends beyond
individual productivity.

46
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,150
Organizations invest significant
resources in training, documentation,

47
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,070
and knowledge transfer initiatives when
knowledge becomes obsolete more quickly.

48
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:27,549
The return on this investment diminishes
forcing organizations to allocate more

49
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:30,460
resources to keeping the teams current.

50
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,990
This creates a continuous cycle where
teams struggle to maintain expertise

51
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:42,660
while the underlying systems continue
to evolve at an increasing pace.

52
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,040
The foundation of AI
driven eco knowledge, if.

53
00:03:46,874 --> 00:03:48,614
AI driven knowledge ecosystems.

54
00:03:49,304 --> 00:03:51,734
The foundation has four layers.

55
00:03:52,035 --> 00:03:55,905
The first one is the foundation
layer, which primarily focuses on

56
00:03:55,905 --> 00:04:00,585
high performance knowledge operations
with low latency access, high

57
00:04:00,585 --> 00:04:02,655
availability, and horizontal scalability.

58
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:08,655
This leverages the vector database,
optimized for similarity search

59
00:04:08,655 --> 00:04:12,194
and event driven architecture
for real time knowledge updates.

60
00:04:12,944 --> 00:04:15,074
And the second layer is
the processing layer.

61
00:04:15,574 --> 00:04:20,765
The cognitive core raw data
transformations into actionable insights

62
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:27,604
through advanced machine learning and
natural language processing, extracted

63
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:32,974
structured data or information from
unstructured sources like logs,

64
00:04:33,694 --> 00:04:38,309
incident reports, communication
threats, and then there is a third

65
00:04:38,369 --> 00:04:39,909
one, which is interaction layer.

66
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:44,789
Which bridges the AI powered
knowledge processing with

67
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:50,820
engineering teams, practical needs
through conversational interfaces.

68
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,640
And the fourth one is integration layer.

69
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,159
This embeds knowledge capabilities
into existing workflows through

70
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:02,630
API, integration with incident
management platforms, monitoring

71
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,000
systems, and collaboration tools.

72
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,909
The processing layer, intelligence
and insight generation.

73
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,440
The processing layer represents
the cognitive core of AI driven

74
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,180
knowledge ecosystems, transforming
raw data into actionable insights.

75
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,990
Through advanced machine learning
and natural language processing,

76
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,080
modern cloud environments generate
vast amounts of unstructured data

77
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,450
containing valuable information.

78
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:37,800
Like log files, incident reports, and
communication logs and communication

79
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,370
threats all contain knowledge that can
enhance future incident report efforts.

80
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:50,000
The processing layer employs
sophisticated NLP algorithms to

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,505
extract structured information from
unstructured sources like log files.

82
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:59,145
In traction layer, it's
human-centered knowledge access.

83
00:05:59,645 --> 00:06:01,475
So there are four phases of it.

84
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:04,025
One is conversational interfaces.

85
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:09,395
This allow teams to ask natural language
questions about system behavior,

86
00:06:09,965 --> 00:06:15,245
historical incidents, and troubleshooting
procedures, reducing cognitive

87
00:06:15,245 --> 00:06:17,435
load during high stress scenarios.

88
00:06:17,935 --> 00:06:19,825
And then there is a visual dashboards.

89
00:06:20,305 --> 00:06:25,135
This presents complex system
relationships, incident timelines

90
00:06:25,495 --> 00:06:30,414
and diagnostic information
in formats, enabling rapid

91
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,235
pattern and decision making.

92
00:06:32,895 --> 00:06:35,235
And the third one is personalization.

93
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:40,410
This adapts to individual user
preferences and expertise levels,

94
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:47,520
providing detailed explanations for
new team members and concise technical

95
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,160
summaries for experienced engineers.

96
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,070
The fourth one is context array delivery.

97
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:58,189
This detects operational
context based on active alerts,

98
00:06:58,609 --> 00:07:01,099
metrics, and user activities.

99
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:08,590
Proactively surfacing relevant knowledge
without requiring explicit queries.

100
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,169
Integration layer.

101
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:16,320
It designed to seamlessly
integrate with workflow embedded.

102
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,200
The integration layer ensures that
AI driven knowledge capabilities

103
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,510
become an integral part of existing
operational workflows rather than

104
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,000
requiring separate tools and processes.

105
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,640
And how do we do that?

106
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:35,199
We have four steps for that, and
the first one is API integration.

107
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,750
This provides the foundation for embedding
knowledge capabilities into existing

108
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:46,000
incident management platforms, monitoring
systems and collaboration tools.

109
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,470
And the second one is workflow automation.

110
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:55,430
This triggers knowledge updates
and distribution based on specific

111
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:01,030
events or conditions automatically
extracting and distributing.

112
00:08:01,765 --> 00:08:05,814
Key insights when teams resolve incidents.

113
00:08:06,314 --> 00:08:09,105
And the third one is contextual delivery.

114
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:14,314
This automatically surfaces relevant
knowledge based on current system

115
00:08:14,855 --> 00:08:20,005
conditions, matching anomalous behavior
patterns with historical incidents.

116
00:08:20,664 --> 00:08:23,664
And the fourth and the final one
is real time synchronization.

117
00:08:24,164 --> 00:08:29,834
And this ensures that knowledge based
content system, data and operational

118
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:37,094
contents are consistently up to date
across all the integrated platforms,

119
00:08:37,905 --> 00:08:40,484
eliminating information, silos and Ds.

120
00:08:40,984 --> 00:08:45,094
Based on this, the real world
implementation and the performance metrics

121
00:08:45,094 --> 00:08:47,435
are shown on this slide, as you can see.

122
00:08:47,854 --> 00:08:53,374
Using this, we can, we have
achieved 99.8% or we could achieve

123
00:08:53,374 --> 00:08:56,044
99.8% of processing accuracy.

124
00:08:56,974 --> 00:09:02,854
This ensures insights and recommendations
are reliable and actionable, meeting

125
00:09:02,854 --> 00:09:08,734
or exceeding human level performance
for many knowledge extraction task.

126
00:09:09,234 --> 00:09:13,550
And this also achieved
90% latency reduction.

127
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:20,079
What that means is it takes less time
to deliver relevant information compared

128
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:24,699
to the traditional knowledge management
approaches requiring manual searches.

129
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:31,119
And this also helped us to achieve
75% reduction in the cognitive burden,

130
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:36,459
decreasing mental effort required
for engineers to find and apply.

131
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,670
Relevant information during high
pressure incident response scenarios.

132
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:47,540
Organizations implementing these
systems report significant improvements

133
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:51,560
in multiple areas that directly
affect their ability to maintain

134
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,144
system reliability and respond
effectively to operational challenges.

135
00:09:57,644 --> 00:10:01,334
Solution generation and
organizational learning.

136
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:07,814
The ultimate measure of knowledge system
effectiveness lies in its ability to

137
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:13,304
accelerate solution generation and support
continuous organizational learning.

138
00:10:13,804 --> 00:10:19,384
Traditional approaches often require
teams to rediscover solutions,

139
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:21,844
but others have already developed.

140
00:10:22,344 --> 00:10:27,324
AI driven knowledge ecosystems can
significantly accelerate solution

141
00:10:27,324 --> 00:10:33,805
generation by automatically identifying
similar historical incidents and

142
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:40,734
presenting relevant approaches, machine
learning algorithms analyze content and

143
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:47,814
current incident characteristics and
match them against historical patterns to

144
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,124
suggest effective troubleshooting steps.

145
00:10:50,624 --> 00:10:55,574
The continuous learning capabilities
ensures that insights from each

146
00:10:55,634 --> 00:11:00,554
incident contribute to collective
knowledge base, creating a positive

147
00:11:00,554 --> 00:11:05,324
feedback loop where incident response
capabilities improve over time.

148
00:11:05,824 --> 00:11:08,524
Building organizational
resilience at scale.

149
00:11:09,024 --> 00:11:14,214
The implementation of AI knowledge
ecosystem represents more than

150
00:11:14,214 --> 00:11:16,734
just a technological upgrade.

151
00:11:17,234 --> 00:11:22,184
It constitutes a fundamental shift
toward building organizational resilience

152
00:11:22,304 --> 00:11:27,764
in phase of increasing technological
complexity and operational challenges.

153
00:11:28,264 --> 00:11:34,954
Scalable resilience requires moving beyond
approaches that depend on individual

154
00:11:34,954 --> 00:11:39,094
expertise or manual maintain processes.

155
00:11:39,594 --> 00:11:44,274
AI driven systems provide the
scalability necessary to maintain high

156
00:11:44,274 --> 00:11:46,194
levels of operational effectiveness.

157
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:49,809
Effectiveness even as complexity
and scope continue to grow.

158
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,444
And because of this, there are two.

159
00:11:52,944 --> 00:11:53,454
Effects.

160
00:11:53,484 --> 00:11:54,954
One is network effects.

161
00:11:55,044 --> 00:11:59,424
As more teams contribute experiences
and insights, the collective

162
00:11:59,424 --> 00:12:03,384
knowledge base becomes increasingly
comprehensive and valuable.

163
00:12:03,884 --> 00:12:05,924
And then there is a cross team knowledge.

164
00:12:06,424 --> 00:12:12,184
This automatically identifies insights
relevant across multiple teams,

165
00:12:12,574 --> 00:12:18,334
breaking down organizational silos and
embedding more effective collaboration,

166
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:23,449
the future direction and conclusion
and continuous evolution.

167
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:25,059
The field of AI driven.

168
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:29,879
Knowledge system continues to evolve
rapidly with the new capabilities

169
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,279
and approaches emerging regularly.

170
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:40,409
Organizations must adopt strategies
for continuous evolution that allow

171
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:43,469
to incorporate new technologies
as they become available.

172
00:12:43,969 --> 00:12:48,199
And we can do this in the three steps.

173
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,559
We can have advanced AI models.

174
00:12:52,294 --> 00:12:58,714
Which has large language models and
advanced reasoning systems offer new

175
00:12:58,714 --> 00:13:04,824
possibilities for knowledge systems
and knowledge synthesis at levels

176
00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:10,854
approaching human comprehension with while
operating at machine speed and scale.

177
00:13:11,694 --> 00:13:14,694
And the second one is
structure operational data.

178
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:19,394
This helps growing availability
of metrics, traces, and logs.

179
00:13:20,084 --> 00:13:27,074
Creates opportunities for sophisticated
analysis, identifying subtle patterns

180
00:13:27,464 --> 00:13:29,264
that might escape human attention.

181
00:13:30,254 --> 00:13:33,794
And then there is a predictive
capabilities, machine learning

182
00:13:34,034 --> 00:13:40,214
algorithms processing vast operational
telemetry to identify leading

183
00:13:40,214 --> 00:13:45,169
indicators of potential issues,
enabling proactive invent interventions.

184
00:13:45,669 --> 00:13:50,919
The key benefits of AI driven knowledge
ecosystem, the first and the foremost

185
00:13:50,979 --> 00:13:53,379
is faster incident resolution.

186
00:13:54,219 --> 00:13:59,479
As reducing mean time to resolution
by automatically delivering

187
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:02,299
relevant historical solutions.

188
00:14:02,704 --> 00:14:04,954
The second one is preserved expertise.

189
00:14:05,454 --> 00:14:09,114
This helps by capturing and
maintaining organizational knowledge

190
00:14:09,204 --> 00:14:12,114
despite team changes and turnover.

191
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:19,214
And the third benefit is scalable
operations and by mean that it supports

192
00:14:19,214 --> 00:14:23,869
growing system complexity without
proportional increase in staffing.

193
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:26,429
And the fourth one is continuous learning.

194
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:32,579
This improves response capabilities over
time through automated knowledge capture.

195
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:38,029
And the fifth and the last one
is enhance resilience, building

196
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:43,849
organizational capacity to withstand
and quickly recover from disruptions.

197
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:46,269
Conclusion, the path forward.

198
00:14:47,229 --> 00:14:52,179
The transformation of incident response
through AI driven ecosystem represents

199
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:57,819
a necessary evolution in response
to accelerating technological change

200
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:00,819
and increasing system complexity.

201
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:07,899
Organizations that successfully implement
these systems position themselves to

202
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,014
maintain high levels of operation.

203
00:15:10,514 --> 00:15:12,674
And operational effectiveness.

204
00:15:12,764 --> 00:15:20,254
Despite rapid evolving cloud technologies,
as organizations navigate the complexity

205
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:26,224
of modern cloud environments, AI
driven knowledge ecosystems will

206
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:28,054
increasingly become a computive.

207
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:33,354
And competitive necessity rather than
merely an operational improvement.

208
00:15:33,854 --> 00:15:39,914
Success of this approach depends
not only on selecting appropriate

209
00:15:39,914 --> 00:15:45,164
AI technologies and architectural
approaches, but also on fostering

210
00:15:45,164 --> 00:15:50,084
organizational cultures that value
knowledge sharing, continuous learning,

211
00:15:50,354 --> 00:15:52,454
and collaborative problem solving.

212
00:15:52,954 --> 00:15:57,484
The organizations that achieve the,
this integration of technological

213
00:15:57,484 --> 00:16:03,094
capability and cultural transformation
will be best positioned to thrive in

214
00:16:03,154 --> 00:16:08,344
an increasingly complex and rapidly
evolving technological landscape.

215
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:12,379
By this, we come to the end
of this presentation and.
