1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,550
Hi, today we are going to discuss
about, enhancing utility operations

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,110
through human AI collaboration.

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,680
And, this is my recording for,
Conf42, JavaScript session.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,050
And, let's dive into, how utilities can
enhance, AI and human collaboration,

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,760
to enhance their operations.

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:22,900
and JavaScript is one of the,
key factor within the CI systems.

7
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:28,255
which enables users to have, predominant
access, having, user experience more

8
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:31,925
better, compared to the previous
versions of the CI systems, and,

9
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:33,425
many other use cases of, JavaScript.

10
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:39,055
But, this is also more, focusing
on, How, AI is used, in the utility

11
00:00:39,075 --> 00:00:44,015
sector for better usability and
experience and enhancing the overall

12
00:00:44,035 --> 00:00:48,005
operational experience of the users
and, serving the better customer base.

13
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:52,305
And, yeah, so let's dive into it, all
So these are the table of contents,

14
00:00:52,305 --> 00:00:53,565
and, I'm going to discuss about today.

15
00:00:53,895 --> 00:00:57,815
especially the predictive analytics
in utilities enhanced, customer

16
00:00:57,815 --> 00:01:01,865
service, A and MA data, ma management
in utilities, the role of, human

17
00:01:01,865 --> 00:01:03,905
enterprise in AI operations.

18
00:01:04,235 --> 00:01:07,385
And, we'll take a case study of,
the Catapult project, and damaging

19
00:01:07,385 --> 00:01:12,165
trench in AI utilities, the evolving,
a relationship and conclusion.

20
00:01:12,855 --> 00:01:15,435
so most often the utility sector shifting.

21
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:19,905
the shift in the technology comes
later after a lot of technological

22
00:01:19,905 --> 00:01:20,975
innovation, innovations.

23
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:25,165
But right now, it's not that it's not
the case because there is a lot of

24
00:01:25,165 --> 00:01:29,805
expectation among the customer base,
within the utility sector, having

25
00:01:29,805 --> 00:01:33,885
to use mobile, more mobile, more of
mobile phones, able to view their

26
00:01:33,915 --> 00:01:38,065
bills, their consumption in real time
and, there are a lot of, programs

27
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:41,595
that are rebate programs and, energy
consumption programs that are going on.

28
00:01:41,845 --> 00:01:45,335
the utility sector is, facing demands
for reliability, sustainability,

29
00:01:45,335 --> 00:01:46,515
and customer satisfaction.

30
00:01:46,545 --> 00:01:49,935
And that's where, Human AI collaboration
provides solution, combining

31
00:01:49,995 --> 00:01:53,085
AI's data processing capabilities
with, human decision making.

32
00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:55,215
And that's the introduction.

33
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:59,745
how, we're talking about, how predictive
analytics in utilities, can be used.

34
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,210
to help better customer service and,
JavaScript is one of the, key factor in,

35
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:10,390
different, business analytics, programs
to show the, user experience, how, they

36
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,400
can view different dashboards and, for
example, there is a tool called WebFocus,

37
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,840
where in JavaScript is predominantly
used to enhance the user experience.

38
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,260
So the AI driven predictive analytics
helps forecast equipment failures

39
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,070
and optimize maintenance schedules.

40
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,730
For example, machine learning
models predict transformer failures,

41
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,520
preventing costly downtime.

42
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:38,460
So managing the downtime, for the
utilities is the major thing which,

43
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:43,430
every utility, company has to take care
because, no one wants an outage for the

44
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,910
sake of, some mechanical failure, right?

45
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,080
the, predictive analytics can be used
to find out, where the, beforehand,

46
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,560
before the, failure of a transformer or
whether you're not getting a leads to

47
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,410
a gatekeeper or The hidden system has
failed to send a reads and where user

48
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:05,100
not able to see the real time data of
the Usage or consumption or the rate

49
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:11,890
details, etc So So let's go to the next
chapter the enhanced a enhanced customer

50
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,800
service like I said before there's a
lot of expectation among the customer

51
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,340
base to, to use the latest and greatest
technologies that are coming into their

52
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:28,250
hand to, view the details, the earlier,
you just have to, print out the usage and

53
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,630
other details and build to the customer.

54
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,610
That's when they'll be able to see,
but now the millennial and, Gen Z

55
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,510
generation, they should be able to see.

56
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,890
their details, whenever they
can and, it doesn't matter.

57
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:44,110
It's midnight till ten o'clock
or, and, there are also a lot of,

58
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,580
programs going on time of use,
net metering, because a lot of.

59
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,460
People now want to shift to clean
energy, so there is, there's a lot

60
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,030
of, focus on, clean energy nowadays,
so all these programs can be

61
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:59,540
integrated with the help of, enhancing
the great customer care service.

62
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,320
there are a couple of, tools
that we can discuss about in the

63
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,250
chat boards that provide 24 by
7 customer service, like I said.

64
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:09,085
They want to see in midnight, 12 o'clock,
the chatbot should be able to guide

65
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:13,345
them to how to retrieve their bills and
how to retrieve their usage details.

66
00:04:13,395 --> 00:04:17,145
AA offers, yeah, so based on the,
to and fro interaction with the

67
00:04:17,145 --> 00:04:21,445
chatbot, the AA should be able to,
provide them energy saving tips and

68
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:22,945
improving customer satisfaction.

69
00:04:22,945 --> 00:04:27,295
So the, let's say a customer was,
recommended a clean energy program

70
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,475
or a net meter energy program.

71
00:04:29,845 --> 00:04:33,095
or a time of use program
or, various other programs.

72
00:04:33,355 --> 00:04:39,435
And, if he could save money on that
program being used, then there is a

73
00:04:39,435 --> 00:04:41,225
lot of satisfaction that he's getting.

74
00:04:41,225 --> 00:04:44,365
And in turn, there is a great
review for the utility company,

75
00:04:44,665 --> 00:04:48,255
for serving them better and, clean
energy and many other things.

76
00:04:48,635 --> 00:04:54,015
And AI complements human agents by,
handling routine inquiries well.

77
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:58,995
Human addresses and complex issues
and AI also allows utilities to

78
00:04:58,995 --> 00:05:02,845
participate, anticipate customer
needs and provide proactive solutions.

79
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:03,695
So it's all about.

80
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,990
replacing the human in this
aspect of the customer service.

81
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,570
so you don't have to run a customer
service team, which would, really have a

82
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,470
lot of customer services team responding
to the phone calls to the customers

83
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:21,180
rather than, a chat bot would really,
be a replacement for a customer service.

84
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,790
using the latest LLM models, it
can determine, the customer needs

85
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,660
and, a predict like in human
and, the accuracy is almost 99.

86
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,410
9 percent helpful for the customers
in providing a better feedback because

87
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,470
there is no latency, there is no,
difference in the communication language,

88
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,930
either you are Spanish or any other
community, which is predominant within

89
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,890
the, area that Utility is serving.

90
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,560
So area and data management
in Utilities, next slide.

91
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,400
AA processes large volumes of data
from smart meters, sensors in real

92
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,740
time allowing for, quicker insights
and, operational adjustments.

93
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,740
Utilities are able to optimize
power distribution and manage

94
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,420
supply more effectively, improving
the grid stability and efficiency.

95
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,580
Real time analytics provides data
that helps in decision making,

96
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,610
such as when to shift lower power
loads or how to integrate renewable

97
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,900
energy resources effectively.

98
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,060
this is all about, getting
the real time data.

99
00:06:14,265 --> 00:06:18,625
so for the period of time, for
example, there is a MO law where every

100
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:23,015
year the computing power increases
to access, by every two years.

101
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:29,975
So, so earlier the cost of computing
different data sources, data, large chunks

102
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:32,555
of data has been huge cost for, utilities.

103
00:06:32,555 --> 00:06:37,265
Now they can put, I will, cloud and,
AI technologies, which, can provide

104
00:06:37,685 --> 00:06:43,675
scaling to get the data and store them,
storing them, and then processing compute

105
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:48,175
can be available based on the, demand
that the information they are getting.

106
00:06:48,455 --> 00:06:51,425
So they don't have to
really scale up the original

107
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:53,235
infrastructure on their on premise.

108
00:06:53,285 --> 00:06:57,615
and, they can really focus on
their operations rather than the.

109
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,170
technical infrastructure.

110
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,300
And once the data is in the system, so
the AI can be fed all the system and

111
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,640
then, predict with using predictive
analytics and, using the large data

112
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,070
that they are getting, they can
easily identify anomalies within

113
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,480
the usage of the, electricity by the
customers, usage of water or anything.

114
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:18,565
Else, beforehand, really, the
customer will be finding out.

115
00:07:18,615 --> 00:07:23,505
So there are, for example, there will
be a lot of issues like diversions and,

116
00:07:23,545 --> 00:07:28,435
for water and especially for water,
customers because they, some of the

117
00:07:28,435 --> 00:07:33,685
commercial customers I have seen, there'll
be a lot of, sometimes tickets created

118
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:38,795
because of the high usage and, the
actual bill is really not built for that.

119
00:07:38,795 --> 00:07:39,095
Thank you.

120
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,340
all these kind of, things can be
really discovered beforehand and really

121
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:48,350
helpful for the, utilities and like
the utility management, the, when they

122
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:52,310
buy the, electricity from Southwest
Power Pool and different other grids.

123
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:57,390
They need to make sure their
grid is stabilized and no one is

124
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:02,060
really attacking them, in terms
of cyber security and other means.

125
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,870
So the endpoint security can
be enabled using the AI and by

126
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,710
checking the data regularly.

127
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,090
let's dive into next chapter.

128
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:14,250
So the role of human expertise
in AI operations, AI can process

129
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,490
and analyze data quickly.

130
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:20,230
Human oversight ensures that AI insights
are used ethically and accurately.

131
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,030
Human professionals validate
AI recommendations, ensuring

132
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,660
that critical judgments and
ethical concerns are addressed.

133
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,800
Human experts provide context and
adaptability to AI systems, particularly

134
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,800
in unexpected or nuanced situations.

135
00:08:34,405 --> 00:08:39,705
the, like I said, like we were discussing,
so the AA cannot 100 percent take over

136
00:08:39,795 --> 00:08:44,945
or replace a human being, but there is
a role for human where it can really,

137
00:08:45,105 --> 00:08:50,395
enhance the human's ability and reduces
the time of operations and how this

138
00:08:50,395 --> 00:08:52,665
can be achieved is, really, amazing.

139
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:55,545
human professionals validate
the AA recommendations,

140
00:08:55,585 --> 00:08:56,885
ensuring that critical judgment.

141
00:08:56,885 --> 00:09:01,910
And Rather than the whole processing and,
com, all the steps that they go through to

142
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:08,580
end anomalies a can do the suggestions and
humans can really take, decisions quickly.

143
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,256
So there's a lot of, cost reduction
here where, there, where the, a

144
00:09:13,256 --> 00:09:17,396
customer service team or business
analysts don't really have to spend a

145
00:09:17,396 --> 00:09:19,071
lot of time in analyzing the data or.

146
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:22,451
finding out, anomalies by
themselves, they can depend on

147
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:25,991
AI to, do the recommendations
and make the decisions quickly.

148
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:31,171
So for example, let's take a catapult
project is a real world example where,

149
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:35,931
we did this project in one of the,
local communities in Kansas Board of

150
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:40,571
Public Utilities where, AI driven edge
computing processes sync data from

151
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:44,211
smart meters and sensors in real time
allowing immediate response to anomalies.

152
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:48,166
A enhanced customer service provided
proactive problem solving and

153
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:51,246
personalized interactions leading
to higher customer satisfaction.

154
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:55,616
So the customer satisfaction is being
gradually improved nowadays because

155
00:09:55,616 --> 00:09:59,766
of using this latest technology so
that, the, at the end of the day,

156
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:03,886
every utility company's, response is
to, Help the customers better, save

157
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:07,846
money for them, and in turn save the
energy cost for themselves so they

158
00:10:07,846 --> 00:10:09,656
can better serve the customers, right?

159
00:10:09,906 --> 00:10:14,016
using these latest and greatest LLM
models and, customer services that

160
00:10:14,036 --> 00:10:17,056
they're, customer service models
that they're using, they just want

161
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:21,246
to enable the customers, Service
provides, better services, personalized

162
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:25,066
interactions, and, And in turn get the
higher customer service satisfaction.

163
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:30,516
So I, I have seen this, within
the lot of utility companies using

164
00:10:30,526 --> 00:10:34,976
the latest technologies to, really
enhance the customer satisfaction.

165
00:10:35,056 --> 00:10:36,106
And, like we mentioned.

166
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:40,951
AI really has that capacity to solve
a lot of, computing, the computing

167
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:44,801
data, for, from smart meters and
sensors in real time so that they

168
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:46,661
can help better the, services.

169
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:49,411
So what are the trends in ai?

170
00:10:49,461 --> 00:10:49,976
the fu the.

171
00:10:50,476 --> 00:10:52,546
Let's discuss about the future trends.

172
00:10:52,556 --> 00:10:56,286
edge computing moving computations closer
to data sources, enabling faster real

173
00:10:56,286 --> 00:10:57,786
time decision making and grid management.

174
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:01,776
Advanced machine learning, deep learning
and reinforcement learning models

175
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:04,936
will improve load forecasting and
failure predictions with high accuracy.

176
00:11:05,346 --> 00:11:09,406
Autonomous systems, AI driven drones
and self healing grids will reduce

177
00:11:09,406 --> 00:11:10,656
human intervention in real time.

178
00:11:10,926 --> 00:11:13,406
dangerous situations, increasing
safety and efficiency.

179
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:16,516
there is a lot of safety concerns
for the employees who are really

180
00:11:16,516 --> 00:11:21,136
working during the outages and,
during any, roadworks or alignments.

181
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:26,506
whoever does that, we can use a lot
of, autonomous systems to, really help

182
00:11:26,546 --> 00:11:30,856
them automate the tasks rather than,
mundane things that they really do.

183
00:11:31,196 --> 00:11:32,686
during outages and other stuff.

184
00:11:32,786 --> 00:11:36,436
so the advanced machine learning,
reinforcement models will improve

185
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,196
the load forecasting and failure
predictions with accuracy.

186
00:11:39,476 --> 00:11:44,096
when the grid is really, the, the
commercial customers are really, they're

187
00:11:44,156 --> 00:11:49,386
charged high when the, there is a peak
demand on the, they apply on this grid.

188
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:55,776
if the, If there is change in the pattern,
it's really helpful for A to analyze

189
00:11:55,826 --> 00:12:02,116
those patterns and really, forecast the
usage based on the customer's, requirement

190
00:12:02,126 --> 00:12:06,616
changes so that, they don't really put
sudden pressure on these grid and so

191
00:12:06,616 --> 00:12:10,356
in turn we'll really help, we'll be
really helping the grid from, failure.

192
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:15,746
for example, there is a grid
failure in Texas in 2021, where.

193
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:21,861
the requirement was huge because of,
the, because of the, the snow that we had

194
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:27,251
and, and the grid was, one of the grids
failed, either should be either because

195
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:32,141
of the usage or because of the, because
of, the not able to produce the energy

196
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,671
demands that customers were requesting.

197
00:12:34,016 --> 00:12:38,136
in that case, a lot of people, a lot
of people suffer from outages and,

198
00:12:38,136 --> 00:12:42,186
really don't really have their basic
needs because that is the main source

199
00:12:42,186 --> 00:12:44,186
for everything, for any of the tasks.

200
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:48,196
so in that situations can be
avoided, because of the grid, the,

201
00:12:48,246 --> 00:12:52,506
the grid failures can be really
avoided using the, upfront knowing

202
00:12:52,516 --> 00:12:55,576
the situations using the edge,
advanced machine learning techniques.

203
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:59,216
The evolving human AI relationship,
the future of human AI collaboration,

204
00:12:59,216 --> 00:13:03,666
AI will increasingly serve a lot of
tools to augment human decision making,

205
00:13:04,056 --> 00:13:07,706
providing data driven insights while
humans focus on strategic thinking.

206
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:09,966
Continuous skill development
will be required, particularly

207
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:11,346
in areas like data literacy.

208
00:13:11,776 --> 00:13:16,826
AI collaborative innovation will raise, as
AI frees up human professionals to focus

209
00:13:16,826 --> 00:13:19,106
on creativity and strategic initiatives.

210
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:19,741
this is.

211
00:13:20,491 --> 00:13:25,491
We discussed this point earlier, the only
major thing here is there should be a

212
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:31,361
lot of, development and understanding,
learning to the customer service team

213
00:13:31,571 --> 00:13:35,051
and, analysts, because of the A, A.

214
00:13:35,151 --> 00:13:39,521
with, if A is, A is like a
real time processor, right?

215
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:43,121
there has to be a lot of upgrade
in their skills, to catch up

216
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:47,271
the, A, advances so that they can
help the, better the customers.

217
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:51,471
So the integration of AI and human
expertise is rapidly transforming,

218
00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:55,361
utility operations leading into
enhanced efficiency, improved

219
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:59,361
decision making, and greater, improved
decision making, and, AI leverage.

220
00:13:59,691 --> 00:14:02,511
A for predictive maintenance,
customer service, enhancements,

221
00:14:02,511 --> 00:14:03,651
and real time data management.

222
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:07,276
While relying on human oversight for
strategy direction, ethical consideration,

223
00:14:07,276 --> 00:14:11,911
and contextual decision making, by
combining the strengths of both AI

224
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:15,359
and human professionals, utility
companies are becoming more responsive

225
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:18,807
to growing demands for reliability,
sustainability, and customer satisfaction.

226
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:22,255
Looking to the future, emerging
technologies such as edge

227
00:14:22,255 --> 00:14:25,221
computing, advanced machine learning
models, and autonomous systems

228
00:14:25,221 --> 00:14:26,771
are set to revolutionize AI.

229
00:14:26,786 --> 00:14:40,371
I'm going to be talking about the,
the new, the new, the new, the new
