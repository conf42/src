1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,740
As organizations globally embrace
digital transformation, implementing

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,820
a human capital management system
has become very essential for

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,620
maintaining competitive advantage.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:19,230
Statistics say that almost 93% of
companies are planning to overall their

5
00:00:20,265 --> 00:00:22,710
HR systems within the next three years.

6
00:00:23,474 --> 00:00:27,915
My name ista sat, and I am an
implementation director with a

7
00:00:27,915 --> 00:00:31,634
DP Technology Services, and I've
been in the HR transformation

8
00:00:31,634 --> 00:00:33,825
space for close to 15 years.

9
00:00:34,364 --> 00:00:39,525
Today in this presentation, I'm gonna
offer a comprehensive framework for

10
00:00:39,525 --> 00:00:44,420
successfully deploying global he CM
systems, focusing on integrating.

11
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,460
Both machine learnings and AI driven
technologies, the buzzwords in

12
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,230
the industry on how organizations
can choose to optimize their

13
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:57,790
HR operations while balancing
standardizations with local needs.

14
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,680
Let us look at some imperatives before
we really jump into the who, why, what

15
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,720
of Global had seen transformations?

16
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:12,830
The modern HR ecosystem in organizations
requires sophisticated systems that

17
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,320
operate seamlessly across countries.

18
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,080
Now, when I say global organizations,
I'm talking about organi companies

19
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,310
in multiple countries that are
presented in multiple countries where.

20
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,720
There are systems that are extremely
fragmented and outdated HR technologies,

21
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,740
and they face a very critical
competitive disadvantage in the

22
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,910
market in attracting, developing, and
retaining talent in their space by

23
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,190
implementing a global HCM solution.

24
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:45,425
Organizations can establish standardized
processes across their countries, across

25
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:50,615
their locals, while also maintaining
that regional flexibility and creating

26
00:01:50,615 --> 00:01:55,745
that equilibrium between consistency as
well as adaptability that will help them

27
00:01:55,745 --> 00:02:01,435
make, get their workforce management
processes into and in an excellent space

28
00:02:01,435 --> 00:02:03,565
that can drive good business outcomes.

29
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,580
Like I said earlier, 93% of companies
are upgrading out of which 42% are

30
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,380
really looking at efficiency gain in
their HR operational processes, and

31
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,690
almost 82% of them are moving into
cloud-based solutions, and they will see

32
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,120
the why behind it In a few slides here.

33
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,000
Before we get into the start, let's
look at the, why do companies want

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,920
to do global HR transformation?

35
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,750
And some of this is to really
require to build a compelling

36
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,820
business use case at the outset.

37
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,370
While there are many reasons that do that.

38
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,860
Sitting really at the top of the
pyramid is a strategic value that

39
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,570
comes out of HR transformations.

40
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,000
These transformations not just, elevate HR
as a business partner, but they also add

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,410
to the financial impact through reduced
administrative cost productivity gains.

42
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,010
There is also operational efficiency
when you implement processes

43
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,580
such as streamlined workflows,
reducing redundancies in your

44
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,050
global operations, et cetera.

45
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,130
And finally, at the base
of the pyramid is where it.

46
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,110
Powerfully unlocks data-driven
insights for proactive talent

47
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,150
management across the organization.

48
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,010
And hence, keeping all of this in mind,
securing your executive sponsorship

49
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,680
demands that you articulate these value
proposition so that it's not just a simple

50
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,540
cost reduction technique, but it also
impacts the organization tremendously.

51
00:03:32,595 --> 00:03:37,755
Effective business cases quantify how
global systems drive these tangible

52
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:41,535
outcomes in terms of workforce
planning, enhancing your leadership

53
00:03:41,714 --> 00:03:45,494
decision making capabilities, and
also fundamentally transforming the

54
00:03:45,494 --> 00:03:50,445
employee experiences that such at
various point of the employee lifecycle.

55
00:03:51,195 --> 00:03:56,924
Successful implementations also require
methodical stakeholder analysis and

56
00:03:56,924 --> 00:03:59,505
engagement across your organizations.

57
00:03:59,535 --> 00:04:04,185
It could be in finance, it could be in
IT operations, even within regional HR

58
00:04:04,185 --> 00:04:09,644
leadership, these strategic allies become
very powerful advocates who can articulate

59
00:04:09,644 --> 00:04:13,740
the system's, cross-functional benefits,
and help overcome resistance to change.

60
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,599
Now talking about so many people how
does the cross-functional collaboration

61
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:25,069
framework and how does this need to
work in a global HR transformation?

62
00:04:25,489 --> 00:04:28,819
Fundamentally, there should be
stakeholder engagement, which means

63
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:33,529
identifying and mobilizing who are
going to be the key partners in your

64
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:38,029
transformation process, and identifying
a government governance structure.

65
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:44,835
Clearly establishing who our decision, who
are sitting in decision making power and

66
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:48,905
who are in operational power and what are
the protocols in the way they communicate.

67
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:54,065
Also, developing a responsibility matrix
in terms of who's responsible for actions.

68
00:04:54,284 --> 00:04:57,405
Who's actionable, who needs to be
communicated versus who needs to

69
00:04:57,405 --> 00:05:02,104
be informed And having a continuous
alignment to revisit some of these

70
00:05:02,104 --> 00:05:06,565
governance and collaboration framework
is of atmos importance when going

71
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:08,190
through HR transformation exercises.

72
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:15,170
Leading organizations also deploy
purposefully built digital collaboration

73
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:19,370
platforms for doing these implementations
where there is real time knowledge

74
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,870
sharing, real time documentation, sharing
systematic issue resolution through

75
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,370
the course of your implementation.

76
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:30,600
And also a comprehensive decision
documentation process that is

77
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,820
dispersed geographically ultimately
driving accountability for not the

78
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,830
headquartered locations, but also.

79
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:41,735
All the other localized countries that
are a part of the implementation in

80
00:05:41,735 --> 00:05:43,355
the transformation journey itself.

81
00:05:44,825 --> 00:05:49,245
AI plays a big role when it comes to
HR transformation as a process because

82
00:05:49,245 --> 00:05:54,725
AI has a very powerful risk mitigation
strategies that can be utilized.

83
00:05:54,974 --> 00:05:57,614
Some of these include
predictive risk identification.

84
00:05:57,825 --> 00:06:00,914
They can analyze implementation
patterns across similar

85
00:06:00,914 --> 00:06:03,120
organizations so that it be able to.

86
00:06:03,445 --> 00:06:06,625
Forecast issues before they emerge, right?

87
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:07,795
Real time monitoring.

88
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:11,335
There are algorithms, machine learning
algorithms that can continuously

89
00:06:11,335 --> 00:06:14,815
look at system interactions to
just detect any sort of anomalies

90
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:18,435
and, indicate, hey, these are areas
where problems may be occurring.

91
00:06:18,895 --> 00:06:22,945
And then finally, data quality is an
area where AI plays a very powerful

92
00:06:22,945 --> 00:06:26,905
role where there can be automated
data validation tools to ensure your

93
00:06:26,905 --> 00:06:31,475
information is, the information integrity
is maintained during your data migration

94
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,635
efforts in a transformation process.

95
00:06:33,945 --> 00:06:38,505
Some of these AI powered risk management,
it represents a paradigm shift from

96
00:06:38,505 --> 00:06:42,075
being reactive in your implementations
to being extremely proactive.

97
00:06:42,285 --> 00:06:45,555
And this really helps and
boosts program governance.

98
00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:49,665
At the outset set, we're
gonna take a tangential shift

99
00:06:49,665 --> 00:06:54,675
from the why and into what.

100
00:06:55,815 --> 00:07:00,195
Organization, global organizations are
moving towards in the HR transformation

101
00:07:00,195 --> 00:07:05,775
space, like I traded earlier, almost
82% of organizations in the world are

102
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:07,725
now moving into the cloud-based space.

103
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:09,795
And why is that shift, right?

104
00:07:09,825 --> 00:07:12,975
Why are organizations
choosing cloud-based?

105
00:07:13,155 --> 00:07:17,004
Instead of on-premise, which has
been the preferred solution of the

106
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:20,934
nineties and the early two thousands,
because the SaaS based deployment, the

107
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:25,405
subscription based eliminates the access
for on-premise infrastructure, right?

108
00:07:25,824 --> 00:07:29,695
Companies don't have to maintain
in-house teams to support the

109
00:07:29,695 --> 00:07:32,155
infrastructure, have expenses on servers.

110
00:07:32,344 --> 00:07:34,984
To host the data of these
large organizations.

111
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:39,815
S scalability becomes an in, a very
obvious answer because there is

112
00:07:39,815 --> 00:07:43,295
instantaneous resource allocation
that flexes with your growth and

113
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:48,965
demand, especially after a pandemic
world where organizations are ups are.

114
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:51,865
Growing and retrenching
in, in waves and crest.

115
00:07:51,865 --> 00:07:55,735
As the economy boosts and economy
falls, scalability becomes very

116
00:07:55,735 --> 00:07:59,695
powerful and hence, cloud-based
systems are a preferred choice.

117
00:08:00,055 --> 00:08:03,145
The infrastructure management
vendor maintain environment.

118
00:08:03,145 --> 00:08:05,845
There are seamless updates
to SaaS-based architecture.

119
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,275
You don't have to have
the system down while.

120
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,280
Opting for these cloud-based systems
is also ensure zero downtime.

121
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,930
And finally, cloud-based systems offer
a very powerful security framework.

122
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,830
Almost all these cloud-based solutions
such as Workday, SAP, Oracle Cloud

123
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:28,030
Fusion, they give a very extremely
robust security frameworks for global

124
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:32,110
organizations that's going to help them
with end-to-end encryption and granular

125
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,510
access controls that suffice locally.

126
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,980
Forward-thinking organizations are really
implementing these hybrid cloud strategies

127
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,240
that secure highly sensitive personal
data in private clouds, while also

128
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,650
simultaneously leveraging public cloud
infrastructure for enhancing processing.

129
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,690
So there is a sort of hybrid cloud that
large organizations are preferring so

130
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,610
that they have, that is something that is.

131
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,710
That seems like promised,
but they're private cloud.

132
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:02,760
So the data and the security
is very well maintained.

133
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,330
This balanced approach also creates
a good equilibrium for these really

134
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:11,310
large organizations between an ironclad
security protocol and robust performance

135
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,650
metrics throughout your HCM ecosystems.

136
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,590
Also, let's talk a little bit about
data governance and regional compliance

137
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:25,010
as an imperative because when it comes
to global HCM implementations data

138
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,140
governance framework has become paramount.

139
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:32,130
Effective global IM implementations
require sophisticated frameworks that.

140
00:09:32,715 --> 00:09:34,835
Comply with regional requirements.

141
00:09:35,045 --> 00:09:39,815
Organizations must build systems that
respect local privacy regulations while

142
00:09:39,815 --> 00:09:42,125
enabling consolidated workforce analytics.

143
00:09:42,275 --> 00:09:45,785
Hence also the cloud-based system
becomes an imperative because data

144
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:49,445
governance and regional compliance
is much more easier to administer

145
00:09:49,445 --> 00:09:51,035
in a cloud-based infrastructure.

146
00:09:51,635 --> 00:09:56,045
Advanced implementations include data
ity solutions that maintain information

147
00:09:56,255 --> 00:10:00,855
within the geographical boundaries
where they need to be housed, required

148
00:10:00,855 --> 00:10:05,405
by law, while also providing that
accu, access for global functions.

149
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:11,930
I. In addition to data governance,
framework, machine learning capabilities

150
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:17,320
for these, HCM cloud-based platforms
are also one of the other preferred

151
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:22,590
area where clients are navigating
or, attracted towards advanced

152
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,060
machine learning capabilities.

153
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,800
E elevate our head CM systems performance
from just being traditional data

154
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,990
repositories into strategic advisors.

155
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,280
These AI powered systems,
ous predictive analysis.

156
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,690
There is intelligence behind the
scenes that gives them in valuable

157
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:44,040
information of how their workforce
is uti, of how their workforce is

158
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,110
performing, where are their areas of.

159
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,310
Focus for HR as a strategic function
market leading organizations, or

160
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:56,800
also implementing talent analytics
that achieve higher retention rate.

161
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,150
There are performance improvements in
in the workforce, and there are also

162
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,280
higher in employee engagement scores
that are being reported with the use

163
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,990
of these cloud-based technologies.

164
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,030
This transformation really in.

165
00:11:11,265 --> 00:11:15,525
F enables HR functions to pivot
from time consuming reactive

166
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:19,875
interventions to high impact, proactive
strategies that, directly influences

167
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,375
their business outcomes itself.

168
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:27,605
So we spoke about the why
and the what are they doing?

169
00:11:27,755 --> 00:11:33,305
Now let's move a little bit into how are
global HR transformations really done?

170
00:11:33,555 --> 00:11:38,745
The fundamental core of how Global HR
transformations are successful is through

171
00:11:38,805 --> 00:11:41,085
excellent change management practices.

172
00:11:41,385 --> 00:11:42,470
And that comes at.

173
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,060
Three layers, right?

174
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,370
The first one is really
awareness building.

175
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,730
And basically before going into
a transformation, you need to

176
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,120
build that awareness across
your organizations of why this

177
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,160
transformation is gonna happen, right?

178
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,790
And from there, you're going to move
into a capability development where you

179
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:02,690
are equipping all the stakeholders of
your transformation process with the

180
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,620
skills as well as the knowledge that
is required for this transformation.

181
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,560
And finally, the adoption
support where you are.

182
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,870
Consciously embedding practices through
continuous reinforcement mechanisms.

183
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:19,150
Basically it could be,
standard operating procedures.

184
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:23,875
It could be job aids where you are
aiding adoption of the HR product

185
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:25,595
itself plays a very key role.

186
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:31,720
Industry leading organization often use
sophisticated persona based journeys.

187
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,220
They're tailored to unique concerns
globally, locally that are influencing.

188
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,120
They influence patterns for stakeholder
segments, right from C-Suite to

189
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,660
frontline managers to in, into
individual contributors or employees.

190
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,950
At the bottom.

191
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,900
The precision approach ensures that.

192
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,440
Capability building initiatives and
communication strategies deliver

193
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,255
maximum re relevance and also the
impact organizations across levels.

194
00:12:57,255 --> 00:13:02,084
Moving over into balancing global,
standardized globally global

195
00:13:02,084 --> 00:13:04,214
standardizations with local flexibility.

196
00:13:04,574 --> 00:13:09,165
We spoke about how change
management is extremely important.

197
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:15,135
From there, I think what is important
in for implementing global HR

198
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,685
transformations is how you maintain.

199
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,760
Global standardization
with local flexibility.

200
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,960
There are fundamental global HR
processes that needs to be designed,

201
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,950
and then the regional adaptations
that are tailored elements that

202
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,480
address local compliant needs.

203
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,560
That comes into picture.

204
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:36,480
Now, world class implementations master
the art of maintaining that equilibrium

205
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:40,890
of what is a global standard process,
which is what is a localized process

206
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:45,790
for enhancing operational efficiency
and also for strategic customization in.

207
00:13:46,145 --> 00:13:50,495
In the market itself, industry
leaders implement outcome focused.

208
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:54,575
Governance frameworks that
prioritize standardized results

209
00:13:54,575 --> 00:13:55,955
rather than rigid processes.

210
00:13:56,255 --> 00:13:59,780
Empowering regional teams with controlled
autonomy to execute within that.

211
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:04,415
Parameters that also make sure data
integrity, reporting consistency

212
00:14:04,415 --> 00:14:07,695
and strategic alignment is
there across the enterprise.

213
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:12,895
Finally, we are gonna wrap up the whole
thing about how an HR transformation

214
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:16,585
really happens and what are like
the next steps of adopting there.

215
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:20,165
Typically, all transformations happen
through an assessment and strategy

216
00:14:20,165 --> 00:14:23,915
phase where there is conduct, where
there is comprehensive current state

217
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:28,805
analysis, where there is articulation of
future state vision and there are also.

218
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,490
Developing business use cases of
ROI metrics, this is basically

219
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,130
sets the foundation of the
whole transformation process.

220
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,330
From there, we will navigate into
design and configuration where there

221
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:44,320
are global processes discussed with
local variations, where there are data

222
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,480
governance protocols, data migrations.

223
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:52,540
And integration frameworks are discussed
of how the HR system or HCM system

224
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,660
is going to integrate with the rest,
and then documenting some of these

225
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,160
dis decisions and, validating some
of these in your environments itself.

226
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,550
And from there, we really move into
the implementation and adoption through

227
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:08,390
deploying through strategic regional waves
with, whether we are going to go big.

228
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,440
Bank in all countries at once
or whether we are going to have

229
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:16,540
regional waves or are we going to
targeted deploy certain specific

230
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,580
user journeys in specific countries.

231
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,920
So the adoption and implementation is
different for different clients and

232
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,600
it can be done in a variety of ways.

233
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,910
And finally, optimization and innovation
is not just implementation, right?

234
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:31,670
Once.

235
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,670
Organizations go live with your HR
solutions, harnessing predictive

236
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,600
analysis and machine learning
there as well to identify any

237
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,160
sort of enhancement opportunities.

238
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:46,620
Establishing dedicated COEs that
continuously expand the system

239
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:51,620
capabilities that can con, that can
churn out measurable business outcomes.

240
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,840
Transformation extends not just with
initial deployment, like I said,

241
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,380
but they must institutionalize these
improvement mechanisms so that they

242
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,960
can fully leverage system capabilities.

243
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,900
This not just requires dedicated
expertise, it also requires executive

244
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:12,630
sponsorship and a very strong culture that
embraces technology innovation as a very

245
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,635
strategic advantage to the organization.

246
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:21,560
I'm hoping all of these, why, what and
how of how global HR transformation

247
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,209
works and can be adopted to the best
helped you in learning a little bit of

248
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:33,590
how ai, as well as ML contributes in in,
in many ways as how HCM implementations

249
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,820
are transforming the world.

250
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,770
Thank you very much for listening to me.
