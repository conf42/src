1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,220
Welcome everyone.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:09,570
My name is Ush K and I am here ready
to present one of the most exciting and

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:16,230
transformative shift happening in modern
healthcare, the integration of artificial

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,540
intelligence into precision medicine.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,940
As we all know, healthcare is
becoming increasingly complex.

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,200
We have dealing with
growing patient population.

7
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:34,214
Rising cost, clinical burnout,
and a massive influx of data

8
00:00:34,815 --> 00:00:39,555
from electronic health records
to genomics and variable devices.

9
00:00:40,394 --> 00:00:42,135
This is where AI steps in.

10
00:00:43,004 --> 00:00:49,485
It gives us the tool to make sense of all
the data and use it to deliver better,

11
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:52,635
faster, and more personalized care.

12
00:00:54,045 --> 00:00:57,209
Today, I will walk you
through the key domains.

13
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:03,375
Where AI is making a difference in
clinical decision making, administrative

14
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:10,155
efficiency, pharmaceutical safety,
diagnostics, research, and of course in

15
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:16,725
enabling vision of precision medicine,
I will also highlight some ethical

16
00:01:16,725 --> 00:01:23,146
considerations and offer an implementation
roadmap for those of you who are

17
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:24,914
bringing AI into their organizations.

18
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,119
So let's begin by looking at
the promise AI holds across

19
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,039
the entire healthcare spectrum.

20
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:36,160
So here we are, the promise
of AI in healthcare.

21
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,570
Sorry for the technical difficulty.

22
00:01:38,335 --> 00:01:41,815
So first of all, AI is
not a distant concept.

23
00:01:42,385 --> 00:01:48,265
It is actively driving miserable
change across three core areas,

24
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:54,235
clinical impact, administrative
efficiency, and research advancement.

25
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:57,205
Let's start with a clinical impact.

26
00:01:57,745 --> 00:02:02,005
One of the most critical challenges
clinicians face in this time

27
00:02:02,215 --> 00:02:06,655
is spent on documentation, AI
assisted documentation tools.

28
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:12,820
Have helped reduce medication
errors by about 30%, which is a

29
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,830
huge improvement in patient safety.

30
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,560
Even more notably, these tools
are saving healthcare providers

31
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,240
around six hours a week.

32
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:28,570
That's valuable time that clinicians
can now spent with patients rather than

33
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,540
trying into electronic health records.

34
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,090
Next, administrative efficiency.

35
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,850
AI is streaming claim processing.

36
00:02:37,645 --> 00:02:42,355
We are seeing turnaround time go
from several weeks to just few days.

37
00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:47,095
More importantly, AI is helping
reducing the denial rates of the

38
00:02:47,095 --> 00:02:53,455
claim by 25%, which means fewer claims
are rejected, fewer reimbursement

39
00:02:53,455 --> 00:02:58,615
cycles, better financial health for
provider organizations and return

40
00:02:58,615 --> 00:03:03,655
on investment is typically realized
within four to six months, making

41
00:03:03,655 --> 00:03:05,635
these solutions not only effective.

42
00:03:05,995 --> 00:03:08,424
But also financially sustainable.

43
00:03:09,385 --> 00:03:15,355
Finally, research advancement in the world
of clinical research is speed is critical.

44
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:20,065
Machine learning algorithms are
accelerating the discovery of new

45
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:25,855
treatment options up to 200 times
compared to conventional research methods.

46
00:03:26,635 --> 00:03:31,105
These systems can shift through
massive database, detect hidden

47
00:03:31,105 --> 00:03:33,655
patterns, and even identify new s.

48
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,250
Paving the way for more effective
and personalized therapies.

49
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,960
Clinical documentation improvement.

50
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,130
So very important.

51
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,260
You can see the big numbers here, right?

52
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:53,060
37% error reduction, 4.2 hours time
saved from the clinical documentation

53
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,850
burden, 93% accuracy rate.

54
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,690
Here we are.

55
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:02,930
AI powered documentation systems are now
capable of achieving 93% accuracy rate.

56
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:09,440
That means they can organize clinical
nodes with very little human corrections.

57
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,740
This reduces the burden on the clinicians.

58
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:20,120
These systems can crosscheck medications,
highlight discrepancies, and even suggest

59
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,580
corrections based on clinical guidelines.

60
00:04:23,945 --> 00:04:26,045
Time saving is another major benefit.

61
00:04:27,455 --> 00:04:30,245
This doesn't just
improve job satisfaction.

62
00:04:30,545 --> 00:04:35,885
It directly impacts the quality of
patient care by allowing doctors

63
00:04:35,945 --> 00:04:41,855
and nurses to focus more on what
they do best caring for people.

64
00:04:42,855 --> 00:04:47,175
Administrative workflow
here, we need to see that.

65
00:04:48,585 --> 00:04:53,985
Starting with the clinical submission,
the claims, the AI system now pre

66
00:04:53,985 --> 00:05:00,225
scan claims before they are submitted,
identifying coding errors, missing

67
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:03,525
documentation, and non-compliance issues.

68
00:05:04,185 --> 00:05:09,915
This proactive review insurers that claims
are accurate and complete, dramatically

69
00:05:09,915 --> 00:05:12,915
improving first pass resolution rates.

70
00:05:13,455 --> 00:05:15,315
Second automated processing.

71
00:05:15,825 --> 00:05:22,155
Machine learning algorithms can now handle
routine claims without human intervention.

72
00:05:23,235 --> 00:05:30,195
This has led 65% reduction in staff
workload to, for claim departments freeing

73
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:33,585
up those resources for more complex tasks.

74
00:05:34,185 --> 00:05:40,845
Denial prevention, AI system analyzes
historical data and flag claims

75
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:42,885
that are likely to be rejected.

76
00:05:44,115 --> 00:05:49,845
They help administrators correct issues
before the claims even leave the door.

77
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:52,545
And what's the result of all of this?

78
00:05:53,205 --> 00:06:02,115
It is faster processing time by 42%
and a 28% reduction in costly denials.

79
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:08,685
That means a smarter cash flow, fewer
disputes and better relationship

80
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,905
between payers and providers.

81
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,300
The next is AI in pharmacy applications.

82
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,260
AI's role in pharmacy is
equally transformative.

83
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,520
Let's look at how it's reshaping.

84
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,680
One second, let's look at
how it's reshaping medication

85
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,020
safety and personalization.

86
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,750
So we are first covering the
prescription verification.

87
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:44,535
AI Systems now performing initial reviews
of prescriptions with 99 by 2% accuracy.

88
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:51,495
That is significantly more reliable
than manual clerk Check work alone.

89
00:06:52,035 --> 00:06:53,955
Next, interaction detection.

90
00:06:54,645 --> 00:06:57,495
An area where AI really shines.

91
00:06:58,005 --> 00:07:02,775
These systems can instantly scan
a patient's full medical record,

92
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:06,045
including prescriptions, lab results.

93
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:10,140
An allergy history to detect
harmful drug interaction.

94
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,780
This level of rapid accurate
detection simply isn't possible

95
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,910
with manual review alone.

96
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,539
AI also supports dosing optimization.

97
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:28,200
It takes into account a range of patient
specific factors such as age, weight,

98
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:34,650
renal functions, and even genetic
markers to suggest personalized dosing.

99
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,100
This minimizes side effects and
maximizes therapeutic impact.

100
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,980
Finally, outcome tracking is where
AI become a long-term partner.

101
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:53,250
These tools continuously monitor
how patients respond to medications

102
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,930
and alert clinicians in real
time for any adverse event.

103
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,670
This helps ensure early
intervention and improves.

104
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,190
Overall treatment outcomes.

105
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,920
Moving down to personalized medicine,

106
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:19,499
p Precis medicine is all about tailoring
care to each individual's unique genetics,

107
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:21,810
environmental, and lifestyle factors.

108
00:08:23,494 --> 00:08:27,780
AI is accelerating this
vision in several key ways.

109
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,180
Let me move it a little bit here so
you can look at the presentation.

110
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,710
So the first second is bio discovery.

111
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:45,240
Traditional analytics often misses
SubT patterns in complex data, but

112
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:52,319
deep learning models can uncover new RS
that reveal disease pathways and help

113
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:55,800
identify novel therapeutic targets.

114
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,360
Time to treatment and
another area of improvement.

115
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:06,300
Clinician decision support system powered
by AI are helping reduce the time it

116
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,570
takes to get the right treatment in place.

117
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:17,250
35%. That means patient starts effective
therapy sooner, recover faster, and

118
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,870
spend less time in the hospital.

119
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,280
Lastly, AI enhances outcome predictions.

120
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,230
By analyzing a patient's full data
profile, labs, imaging history, and

121
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:36,390
even variable data, AI can forecast
how they will respond to treatment.

122
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,849
This enables clinicians to
adjust the care plan early,

123
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,460
increasing the chances of success.

124
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,660
This is where is a very interesting
thing I want to share with all of you.

125
00:09:48,869 --> 00:09:52,829
It's diagnostic imaging breakthrough
through artificial intelligence.

126
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:01,860
AI system trained on large imaging data
sets, like CT scans, MRIs, x-rays are now

127
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:08,340
capable of identifying abnormalities with
high level of sensitivity and specificity.

128
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,230
This means that they can detect
both the presence of disease and

129
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,070
accurately rule it out in many cases.

130
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,600
Matching or even exceeding
the performance of experienced

131
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,790
clinician for certain conditions.

132
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,770
One key advantage of AI in
imaging is its consistency.

133
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:34,980
Unlike human observers, AI does
not suffer from fatigue, bias,

134
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,600
or variations in judgment.

135
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,970
It sees every scan with the same
level of detail and attention.

136
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:47,339
And with the right training, it can
spot subtile patterns that might

137
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:49,650
be missed during a manual review.

138
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:55,650
AI is also reducing the
radiologist workload by 28%.

139
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,380
That's not because it's replacing them.

140
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:02,850
It is because it is filtering
and prioritizing routine task.

141
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:07,860
For example, it can automatically
sort normal scans from those

142
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,510
requiring urgent attention.

143
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,730
Helping Radiologists focus their
time where it matters the most.

144
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,150
Another exciting application
is early detection.

145
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:23,129
AI is already being used in
identifying early signs of diseases

146
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:28,020
like breast cancer, lung nods,
and even neurological disorders.

147
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:33,119
Early diagnosis leads to
earlier intervention and often

148
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,310
have far better outcomes.

149
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,819
Ultimately, AI doesn't
replace radiologist.

150
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:45,630
It augments them acting as a second
set of eyes and helping them work

151
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,910
more efficiently and effectively.

152
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,930
Workforce adoption very important.

153
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,500
Why?

154
00:11:52,680 --> 00:12:00,090
Because without this, all AI is
adjusted, accommodated, understood,

155
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,190
and applied by the workforce.

156
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,740
It'll not give its fruit to us.

157
00:12:05,565 --> 00:12:10,875
One of the most important and sometimes
overlooked component of AI adoption in

158
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,185
healthcare is preparing the workforce.

159
00:12:13,995 --> 00:12:15,705
We begin with AI literacy.

160
00:12:17,565 --> 00:12:22,935
This means ensuring everyone in the
organization, from frontline clinicians

161
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:30,225
to IT staff, executives, they all
understand what AI is, how it works, and

162
00:12:30,225 --> 00:12:32,655
how it applies to their specific roles.

163
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:38,010
Establishing a common vocabulary
and baseline knowledge is critical

164
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,110
for cross-functional collaboration.

165
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,050
Next role, specific training.

166
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,190
A one size fits all
approach Want to work here?

167
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,990
Clinicians, for instance, need to
understand how AI can support clinical

168
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,000
decision making and documentation.

169
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:58,410
Administrators may focus on claim
processing, operational analytics,

170
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,060
or scheduling optimization.

171
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:04,050
Technical staff need to understand
how to maintain, monitor,

172
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,240
and troubleshoot AI systems.

173
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,090
Then we move to hands-on implementation.

174
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,180
Theoretical knowledge
is only the beginning.

175
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:18,000
Simulated environments like AI powered
EHR system or virtual diagnostic

176
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,720
tools allow staff to get comfortable
using AI in low risk settings before

177
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,880
applying it to the real world scenarios.

178
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,010
And finally.

179
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,685
There must be a commitment
to continuous development.

180
00:13:33,255 --> 00:13:37,155
AI tools and practices
are evolving rapidly.

181
00:13:38,205 --> 00:13:42,675
A structured programs that includes
peer learning, regular updates,

182
00:13:42,945 --> 00:13:47,715
workshops, and even certification
track help ensure that knowledge

183
00:13:47,715 --> 00:13:51,285
stays current and still stays sharp.

184
00:13:52,335 --> 00:13:56,505
When organization invest in
people alongside technology, the

185
00:13:56,505 --> 00:13:58,185
results are a smoother adoption.

186
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:05,700
Higher trust in AI system and ultimately
better outcomes for our patients.

187
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,270
Next is ethical considerations
in AI implementation.

188
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:16,030
With all the benefit AI offers,
it is essential that we take a

189
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:21,070
thoughtful and ethical approach to
how it's implemented in healthcare.

190
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:29,050
First, we must address fairness and
equity algorithms are only as good

191
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,300
as the data they are trained on.

192
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,210
If the data lakes diversity or
if it reflects historical biases,

193
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:41,200
then the AI can unintentionally
spread those differences.

194
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,240
It's critical to ensure that AI
systems are tested and validated

195
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,910
across diverse population.

196
00:14:49,345 --> 00:14:54,325
So that everyone receives high
quality care regardless of

197
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:57,805
race, gender, age, or geography.

198
00:14:58,525 --> 00:15:03,445
Second, privacy protection
healthcare data is among the most

199
00:15:03,505 --> 00:15:05,335
sensitive types of information.

200
00:15:05,965 --> 00:15:10,285
Organizations must implement
strong enterprise grade security

201
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:12,510
protocols to safeguard patient data.

202
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:18,715
At the same time, we must find ways to
enable data sharing for AI training and

203
00:15:18,715 --> 00:15:22,225
development in ways that respects privacy.

204
00:15:23,905 --> 00:15:25,315
Then there is transparency.

205
00:15:26,065 --> 00:15:30,775
Clinician needs to understand how AI
system arrives at their recommendations.

206
00:15:31,225 --> 00:15:36,385
If an AI suggests a diagnosis or
flags a risk, there must be an.

207
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,150
Interpretable explanation
behind that output.

208
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:47,830
Transparency builds trust, which is
essential for adoption and also aligned

209
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,480
with the regulatory requirements.

210
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:54,040
And finally, we can't forget
about human whole oversight.

211
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:58,570
AI is a tool, not a replacement
of clinical judgment.

212
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,950
Doctor and nurses should always
be in the control of decision.

213
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,120
Using AI as an assistant,
not an authority.

214
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,730
In fact, some of the best performing
systems are those that blend AI

215
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:18,100
suggestions with human experience
makes the most informed choices.

216
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:24,935
Ethics must be embedded into design,
implementation, and monitoring of every

217
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,790
AI system we deploy in healthcare.

218
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,900
Now, let's talk about financial aspects.

219
00:16:32,695 --> 00:16:37,675
Because at the end of the day,
AI adoption tools be sustainable.

220
00:16:37,825 --> 00:16:40,075
It must deliver value here.

221
00:16:41,965 --> 00:16:42,205
Yeah.

222
00:16:42,895 --> 00:16:47,185
So one of the most promising sign
is that the healthcare institution

223
00:16:47,185 --> 00:16:52,405
begins seeing a positive return on
investment within nine to 14 months.

224
00:16:53,335 --> 00:16:58,135
That's relatively short timeframe,
especially for hospitals or healthcare

225
00:16:58,135 --> 00:17:00,925
systems that are used for a long ROI.

226
00:17:02,185 --> 00:17:04,315
The saving come from multiple areas.

227
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:10,675
For example, documentation cost drops
significantly by about 1.2 million

228
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:12,865
annually for a mid-size hospital.

229
00:17:13,795 --> 00:17:18,295
This is due to automation and reduced
errors that would otherwise require

230
00:17:18,295 --> 00:17:20,935
rework or lead to billing issues.

231
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:25,015
Medication related errors
are dropped by 42%.

232
00:17:25,765 --> 00:17:28,730
These kind of errors can lead
to costly adverse events.

233
00:17:29,395 --> 00:17:34,975
Legal actions for extended hospitality
preventing them is both a patient

234
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,925
safety and a financial imperative.

235
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,005
Another benefit is a staff productivity.

236
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:49,285
By automating routine task, clinical
teams can handle more patient and some

237
00:17:49,345 --> 00:17:51,085
number of with the same number of staff.

238
00:17:51,265 --> 00:17:56,425
In fact, institutions have 9.3%
increase in patient throughput,

239
00:17:56,905 --> 00:17:58,435
meaning more patient treated.

240
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,130
Shorter wait time.

241
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,030
Improved care without
hiring additional personnel.

242
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:10,570
The key takeaway here is that AI, when
implemented strategically, is not just

243
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:16,990
a cost, it's an investment, and it pays
dividend in financial savings, quality

244
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,240
of care, and operational capacity.

245
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,650
Implementation roadmap
for healthcare leaders.

246
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,780
So now if you're wondering how
to get started with AI in your

247
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:36,140
organization, this roadmap outlines
a practical and phased approach is

248
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,480
step one is assessment and planning.

249
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:44,060
Look for high value opportunities
that align with your strategy is your

250
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:49,280
biggest pain point is documentation
or claim processing or diagnostics.

251
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,580
Identifying the right
starting point is crucial.

252
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,340
Next is stakeholder engagements.

253
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,980
Build clinical and administrative
champions at all level and how you do

254
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:07,310
that, get buy-in early and include end
user in the design and rollout process.

255
00:19:08,045 --> 00:19:12,215
The more ans they are, the smoother,
easier implementation will be.

256
00:19:12,905 --> 00:19:15,785
Then comes phased implementation approach.

257
00:19:16,415 --> 00:19:20,225
Don't try to deploy all
AI everywhere at once.

258
00:19:20,735 --> 00:19:24,455
Start with focused pilot in
one department or workflow.

259
00:19:24,905 --> 00:19:31,030
Use those to refine your system, train
your teams, and work out any issues.

260
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:37,235
Once you are proven success on a smaller
scale, you can expand with confidence.

261
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,000
And finally measure and optimize.

262
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:48,080
Define clear metrics from the start,
like error rates, time savings,

263
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,390
return on investment metrics.

264
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,580
Track them continuously.

265
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,790
Use this data to improve the system.

266
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:56,660
Fine.

267
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:02,180
Tune the algorithm and ensure you
are delivering the result you expect.

268
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,500
Following this roadmap
does not just reduce risk.

269
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,700
It builds a foundation for sustainable,
scalable success with AI in healthcare.

270
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:20,960
I hope this talk has given you a
clear sense of both the opportunities

271
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:27,375
and the practical steps involved in
leveraging AI to transform healthcare.

272
00:20:27,865 --> 00:20:28,335
Thank you.
