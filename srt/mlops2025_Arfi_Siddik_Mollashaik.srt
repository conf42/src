00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,309
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,809 --> 00:00:02,469
My name is Fu Sadik.

3
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,609
I've been working as a solution
architect for security ai.

4
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:11,719
I have over 18 plus years of experience
in data security and privacy space, and

5
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:17,960
today I am here for a session on a driven
cybersecurity intelligent threat detection

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,424
and privacy in the post quantum era.

7
00:00:20,924 --> 00:00:25,054
Today we'll be discussing about the
evolving cyber threat landscape, where

8
00:00:25,054 --> 00:00:29,404
we'll be understanding the current threats
and the essential role of a ML for modern

9
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:35,194
defense and building a ML classification
for framework where we'll be architecting

10
00:00:35,194 --> 00:00:41,854
multimodal detection system and realtime
time pipeline for emerging threats and

11
00:00:41,854 --> 00:00:46,414
privacy, preserving ML techniques and
those, how we can leverage that in.

12
00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:51,469
A ML Detections and implementation
and operational excellence.

13
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:57,619
We transitioning a ML solution proof
from proof of concepts to the production,

14
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:02,779
deployment and monitoring, and finally
preparing for post quantum error where

15
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:08,360
we'll be using the feature proofing of
A ML system again, is the challenges

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,070
of course, quantum cybersecurity.

17
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,220
Evolving cyber threat landscape.

18
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,710
So we all know that the signature
based systems currently are not

19
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,490
of capable or sophisticated to
the attacks that we have now.

20
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:27,550
We have all modern ways of doing attacks
or coming from different sources.

21
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:32,899
So there are apps employing increasingly
sophisticated EVA techniques.

22
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:37,880
There are zero day explosives targeting
previously unknown vulnerabilities.

23
00:01:37,985 --> 00:01:42,204
Polymorphic wall bear and file less
wall bear and even in the supply

24
00:01:42,204 --> 00:01:46,104
chain attacks compromised, trusted
software distributed channels.

25
00:01:46,104 --> 00:01:50,394
And so all because of these advanced
attacks, the conventional security

26
00:01:50,394 --> 00:01:56,434
tools struggle to keep up the pace
and they are failed by 38% detection

27
00:01:56,434 --> 00:01:58,275
today with the sophisticated attacks.

28
00:01:58,275 --> 00:02:02,734
And so there is a need for a,
an enhancement where we use

29
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:06,309
a ML. Cybersecurity to detect
these ahead of the time.

30
00:02:07,089 --> 00:02:12,099
So what we do here is we will first do
the behavioral detection and then we do

31
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:17,140
the predictive capabilities and then adapt
to response and resource optimization.

32
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,929
In the behavioral detection, we use
A EML techniques, Excel to identify

33
00:02:21,929 --> 00:02:26,909
anomaly anonymous users and system
behaviors and detect threats that

34
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:29,130
signature based tools or lack of.

35
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,470
Then predictive capital, it is
leveraging these threat intelligence.

36
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:39,290
MLL algorithms can proactively forecast
emerging threats before fully materialized

37
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:45,350
means we leverage the threat intelligence
and the M-L-A-M-L algorithms, how a

38
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:50,030
predictive analysis to do and then
predict it before it materialize.

39
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:55,160
And then the adaptive response ML systems
continuously learn from the new data.

40
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:01,790
And enabling them to adopt defense against
the attacks the vector autonomously.

41
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,690
So resource optimization will do
a power trade significantly reduce

42
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,510
by intellectual intelligently pre
threats based on comprehensively

43
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,730
scores and the contextual analysis.

44
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,239
And so where we know that how
to respond, and then based

45
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,320
on the priority and severity.

46
00:03:18,994 --> 00:03:22,144
Use resources optimization
while responding in.

47
00:03:23,075 --> 00:03:27,124
And these advanced ML classification
models drastically improve the

48
00:03:27,214 --> 00:03:32,734
cybersecurity outcomes, and that enables
93% detection date from previously.

49
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:35,295
And same the signature
based tools that we have.

50
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:39,095
And here we'll be using multimodal
detection architecture where

51
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,070
we first gather the data.

52
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,260
We use supervised learning
and deep learning here.

53
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,670
And in the supervised learning, we
utilizes the label data sets of known

54
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:52,320
threats for classification, where we'll
be using random for as gradient boosting

55
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,750
and super support vector machines.

56
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,240
And so in unsupported unsupervised
learning, we, it identifies

57
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,570
anomalies by detecting deviation
from the normal patterns where

58
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,405
we'll be using isolation for us.

59
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,059
One class, SVP DB scan, clustering it.

60
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:11,910
And finally, the deep learning
where we employ neural networks

61
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,530
for complex pattern recognition.

62
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,010
Where we will be using LSTM
networks, transform models,

63
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,560
computational, conventional networks.

64
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,670
And these are the, an approach
combines diverse models to achieve

65
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,480
significant higher accuracy and reduce
false positives compared to the.

66
00:04:27,885 --> 00:04:28,755
Individual model.

67
00:04:28,755 --> 00:04:34,275
So if you compare what's happening in the,
compare it to the traditional way of data

68
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:40,730
classification to the a, a ML base, in
the traditional classification, we use a

69
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,420
regular expression or a metadata patterns.

70
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:51,560
But here as as a ML is evolving, we are
using all these AI techniques to more to

71
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,945
add more context and, context and content
to it so that we will be doing a more

72
00:04:56,945 --> 00:05:02,405
accurate data classification where we'll
be seeing 80% of the accuracy without

73
00:05:02,405 --> 00:05:07,715
any efforts and where we'll be, we are
minimizing the false positives at a

74
00:05:07,715 --> 00:05:11,480
greater rate and then high increasing the
higher accuracy in the classification lab.

75
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,205
And then feature engineering for cyber
security ml where we'll be using.

76
00:05:16,075 --> 00:05:21,185
Network traffic feature features and user
behavior feature and host specific feature

77
00:05:21,395 --> 00:05:23,705
means in the network traffic features.

78
00:05:23,705 --> 00:05:29,245
We will be studying the protocol deviation
anomalies and the deviation flow metadata

79
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:33,710
where deviation volumes will be featured,
and then temporal patterns and burst

80
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:35,750
and destination and tr and new location.

81
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,880
In the user behavioral feature,
we'll see we'll verifying that

82
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,200
authentication patterns and how the
users are authenticating and access

83
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,700
and distribution, at what time they're
trying to access and data access, and

84
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,570
the movement patterns and where, at
what time they're running some queries

85
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:57,140
or the command frequency profiles, C
profile set, and then host based feature.

86
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,560
We will process execution,
chain system call sequences,

87
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,120
resource utilization patterns.

88
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:05,225
And registry and file system changes.

89
00:06:05,885 --> 00:06:09,935
So effectively effective feature
selection increases model

90
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:15,305
performance by 40% when reducing the
computational overhead and realtime

91
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:17,225
classification pipeline architecture.

92
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:19,045
So this is very important here.

93
00:06:19,515 --> 00:06:23,285
The, from where it starts and
how we automate this process.

94
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,250
The first step is data tion.

95
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,760
We collect all the information
from sensors, logs and network

96
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,680
tabs, our database logs and all.

97
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,490
And then we feature extract as
we discuss in the real time.

98
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,754
We we real time pass it and vectorize
signals based on the data tion.

99
00:06:40,504 --> 00:06:45,815
And then we do ML and where panel
supervisor and deep models will be used.

100
00:06:45,844 --> 00:06:48,515
And then based on that,
we'll do the scoring.

101
00:06:49,145 --> 00:06:54,665
You'll use aggregated models to, to to
add the risk scores and based on the

102
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:59,765
risk scores, you automate the responses,
you take your mitigation or update data.

103
00:07:00,265 --> 00:07:03,475
And then the, where we can use the
privacy pre preserving ML techniques.

104
00:07:03,475 --> 00:07:07,430
So because you are processing a huge
data as part of this, and there could

105
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,015
be some sensitive data about the
industry that you are working in.

106
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:15,045
That's where we use these techniques
to be in compliance and with the

107
00:07:15,045 --> 00:07:21,165
regulations like GDPR, hiphop,
P-C-I-P-H-I regulations, CCPA regulations.

108
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:26,325
So we'll be using the here, the
federated level and differential

109
00:07:26,325 --> 00:07:29,885
privacy and homo encryption in learning.

110
00:07:29,945 --> 00:07:33,215
It transforms the data into
decentralized UIS with the local

111
00:07:33,215 --> 00:07:37,740
data and eliminate the raw data
exchange means that data is not going.

112
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,570
Anywhere it's all local to
the model and we process it.

113
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,650
You, even with the sensitive data,
differential privacy is the same

114
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:50,470
thing as but where we'll be adding
some noise to the trying data to put

115
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,720
output of our mathematical privacy
guarantees preserving utility.

116
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,160
So in this case, we.

117
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:01,190
It's a, it is the same raw data, but we'll
be adding some noise to it so that it

118
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:07,610
mimic the data and then use that, use data
for ML processing it and homo homomorphic

119
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:12,885
encryption where it enables competition
on encrypted data without decryption

120
00:08:12,885 --> 00:08:17,960
allowing a ML operations answers to
data while maintaining confidentiality.

121
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,390
Yeah, this is.

122
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:24,330
On the fly encryption it does, and
without decaling it so that AI ml can

123
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:28,940
use that data for their processing
and how we do the implementation.

124
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,260
So from previous two production, this is
a phase approach where the first voice

125
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,980
is the phase one is the foundation.

126
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,790
Phase two is the control deployment, and
phase three is the scale, the production.

127
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,555
So in the phase one, what we do is we
establish a robust data collection, as I

128
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:48,055
mentioned, from different sources like,
and then we do the labeling as part of

129
00:08:48,055 --> 00:08:51,805
data classification and perform extension,
feature engineering and selection.

130
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,855
And we conduct initial model training
and validation and integrate this

131
00:08:55,855 --> 00:08:57,535
with the existing soft tools.

132
00:08:57,535 --> 00:09:02,305
And then in the control deployment,
we deploy models in shadow mode.

133
00:09:02,305 --> 00:09:06,295
Again, as the existing systems
we measure performance rigorously

134
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,065
against as establish baselines.

135
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:13,760
We optimize threshold and minimize false
parties, false positives using techniques

136
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:18,360
and provide a comprehensive security
team training and collect the feedback.

137
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,300
And in phase two, it's a scale production.

138
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,920
We gradually transition from legacy
detection systems implement CACD pipeline

139
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,855
to continuously update the models.

140
00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:32,025
Automate model retraining
and deployment cycles.

141
00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:36,805
And finally integrate this with the
real time performance and visualization.

142
00:09:37,555 --> 00:09:42,115
This as this is a phased approach, the
advantage is you reduce the risk while

143
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:46,255
enabling continuous validation and
improvement of ML systems and then the co

144
00:09:46,675 --> 00:09:48,595
operationalize the excellence and monitor.

145
00:09:48,925 --> 00:09:52,020
And as part of operationalization,
that for excellence.

146
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:57,300
We see the performance indicators
like you detect the latency and

147
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,250
average time to classify incoming
traffic and false positive rates.

148
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,305
Then attack coverage and percentage
of a known attack vector detected

149
00:10:05,515 --> 00:10:09,045
zero day detection success rate
in identifying previously threats.

150
00:10:09,545 --> 00:10:12,725
So this is a continuous improvement
process where you automate

151
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,390
these models to detections.

152
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,600
Take the human feedback and then the
intelligence integrated with that.

153
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,140
And then we do heavy testing
of model improvements.

154
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,520
And next one is preparing for
the post quantum cybersecurity.

155
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,030
So post quantum is the next
generation where how we were

156
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,770
leveraging the post quantum
cybersecurity into the set detection.

157
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,840
Where here we'll be using quantum
threat models, where the quantum

158
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,180
computing, particularly algorithms like
source processes a significant threat

159
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:47,710
to current public key cryptography,
including R-S-A-E-C-C and deal Mann.

160
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,320
And then the post quantum cryptography.

161
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,170
NIST has identified poster quantum
cryptography standards like crystal.

162
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,870
This is a key encapsulation.

163
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,310
The lithium digital signature
to protect ML models against

164
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,630
the future quantum threats.

165
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,680
So these are the prone the
cryptographic techniques that the

166
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,270
ML models are currently using.

167
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,370
And then the strategy ML system
preparedness where key strategies for ML

168
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:19,950
systems in the quantum transition involved
integrating crypto agility, adopt hybrid,

169
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,100
classic, and post quantum approaches and.

170
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:26,715
So proactively if we integrate
post quantum cyber security

171
00:11:26,715 --> 00:11:28,725
into ML pipelines is critical.

172
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:33,395
Because from the coming five to six
years, the transition is projected.

173
00:11:33,395 --> 00:11:37,265
Our nation must be now ensure
long term cyber security.

174
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:42,385
Our automation should be ready to adopt
to these post quantum cyber security

175
00:11:42,985 --> 00:11:44,845
embedded into the a ML processor.

176
00:11:45,345 --> 00:11:46,425
So key takeaways.

177
00:11:46,485 --> 00:11:51,185
So we covered DIML, driven cybersecurity,
transformers privacy, first ML

178
00:11:51,185 --> 00:11:55,345
deployment, and how with the phased
approach and shared implementation.

179
00:11:55,345 --> 00:11:57,925
And and then finally,
proactive quantum readiness.

180
00:11:58,425 --> 00:11:59,050
Thank you for your time.

181
00:11:59,445 --> 00:12:02,095
I hope you enjoy session and thanks a lot.
