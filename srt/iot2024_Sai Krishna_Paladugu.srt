1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,900
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,929
Myself Sai Krishna Paladugu.

3
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,740
I'm a senior iOS developer.

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,430
So today my topic is revolutionizing
contactless kiosk integration

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,149
with iOS mobile devices.

6
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,349
So everybody in the mobile world
and day to day life, mobile

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,549
devices are more important.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,180
So they are playing a very
vital role in everybody's life.

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,189
so how we can use this.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,599
For a nice applications where in the
industrial purpose and in a retail

11
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:37,310
purpose and transportation purpose
there are so many purposes these iOS

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:41,579
devices are useful when we deploy
into the customer facing world.

13
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:46,800
So these can be powerful contactless
solutions where we go with the

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,750
technologies like NFC, Bluetooth, QR code.

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,240
So scanning, all the QR codes or
any barcodes, these are all like

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,430
touch free interactions for kiosk.

17
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:04,050
So basically my presentation covers
the key features and also use cases

18
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,500
of iOS based contactless kiosk.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,450
So let me go to the first slide.

20
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,710
So the NFC technology.

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,730
So mostly this is very secure one.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,770
So where customer can tap to pay.

23
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,980
It is a seamless interaction.

24
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,880
So where we use the iPhones.

25
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,990
So it's a payment integration, the
framework, which is provided by

26
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,979
Apple that we can embed into the
native iOS app and where can process

27
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:35,750
these transactions as a touch free.

28
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,770
So this is how we were developed.

29
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,129
And, this is.

30
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:47,300
So much helpful for the current all the
outside industries so the digital tick

31
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:54,380
ticketing it's mostly the cinema theaters
and also the the flight Booking and flight

32
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,310
tickets retrieving the flight tickets
using the all this digital ticketing So

33
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,709
where nfc is enabled for quick validation
and access control users can Store

34
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:09,805
and present digital tickets on their
devices So and also the third one is a

35
00:02:09,805 --> 00:02:14,655
secure authentication nfc technologies
allows secure For user authentication.

36
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:19,774
This is crucial for personalized
services and data protection so These

37
00:02:19,775 --> 00:02:25,244
are all the three key main features
that is enabled for nfc technologies.

38
00:02:25,315 --> 00:02:30,105
It's a seamless transactions So
next one is the powerful one.

39
00:02:30,105 --> 00:02:35,830
It's a bluetooth where it is a proximity
based service Where we can embed with the,

40
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:43,120
iOS apps, how iOS apps can be used with
the iOS devices like iPhones and iPads.

41
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,200
So automated check in.

42
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:48,829
The Bluetooth can trigger automatic
check ins as a user approach.

43
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:53,189
The kiosk, this streamlines the user
experience and reduce wait times.

44
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,619
It is, it helps automatic check ins.

45
00:02:55,699 --> 00:03:01,939
User can come and check in for their
appointments at the doctor's office

46
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:05,799
or anywhere, which is applicable
for a check in of the customer.

47
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,759
So personalized greetings, another one.

48
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,680
Kiosk can display a personal
greeting based on user proximity.

49
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,580
This enhances customer
engagement and service quality.

50
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,780
If user wants.

51
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,350
The specific users want the specific
personalized messages where they can

52
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,580
check in and based on the customer
preference and customer, data, it will

53
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,300
be shown the customer, custom greetings.

54
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,270
So location based offers the bluetooth
enables the delivery of a location

55
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,140
specific promotions This increase the
relevance and potential sales conversions.

56
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:44,120
So basically, in a shopping mall, the
customers are roaming around and, they

57
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,659
can use their mobile and use the iOS app.

58
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,650
To see the location based, offers based on
some Fuma store or Adidas or Under Armour.

59
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,630
So wherever if they push something, they
can easily see based on their location.

60
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:07,700
So this is something more interesting
when we use a location based services, so

61
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:13,380
this is a powerful for a sales standpoint
for in a retail, customers like it,

62
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,890
it attracts a lot for the customers.

63
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,820
so that is why I call it as a Bluetooth
is also a powerful technology where we

64
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:27,989
can embed in with, this kiosk and also
we can use for, iOS mobile apps as well.

65
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:31,999
the other things, the barcode scanning.

66
00:04:32,369 --> 00:04:36,099
So this is also major, major
significant impact on the current

67
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:40,439
market, where people are using QR
codes to retrieve their labels.

68
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:46,544
And, in the transportation, like if
example, like a FedEx or UPS or any

69
00:04:46,544 --> 00:04:50,344
other stores, the the customer coming
with the third party retailer QR

70
00:04:50,344 --> 00:04:54,394
code, they can scan their QR code and
get their label and stick on their

71
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,624
package and send it to the, retailer.

72
00:04:56,804 --> 00:05:00,674
So this is something very unique and
they don't need to print at their home.

73
00:05:00,674 --> 00:05:04,894
And they just come in with the email
where they can see their, unique QR

74
00:05:04,894 --> 00:05:06,704
code for their, return shipments.

75
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:11,179
So this is absolutely a good
practice for the customer.

76
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:12,679
It is a hassle free.

77
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:19,589
So scan, scanning their QR codes
using that initiation, initiating

78
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:21,399
the shipment labels and all.

79
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:23,329
So it is a scan.

80
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,379
Another thing is a process.

81
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:27,789
The process, how that takes place.

82
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,689
The software process, the scan
information that will send to the

83
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:32,799
backend, like retrieving their data.

84
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:37,279
Specific to the customer and they
will get the, significant, whatever

85
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,139
the alignment of the product that,
that is lined up with the retailer.

86
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,989
So another thing is
third one is a respond.

87
00:05:44,989 --> 00:05:48,469
The kiosk provides appropriate response
and services based on the scan.

88
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,679
This could include displaying
information and processing transactions

89
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:53,549
respective to the customer.

90
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:59,169
So these three steps, Are common for
the QR code and barcode scanning.

91
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:06,019
So where self serve kiosks are integrated
with Scanners and also the printers the

92
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:12,029
scanners are capable to scan the barcodes
and QR codes And, yeah, these features

93
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:17,209
are very helpful, even go to the Walmart
and any of the, the Kroger or any of the

94
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:21,999
marketplaces, the daily life, these are
all self service are increasing a lot.

95
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,399
so manual becomes automation.

96
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,999
So this is so much.

97
00:06:26,724 --> 00:06:32,264
So much useful for the current,
current anybody in the customer market.

98
00:06:32,764 --> 00:06:34,434
So apple pay integration.

99
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:38,144
So this is one of the groundbreaking
feature from the apple.

100
00:06:38,154 --> 00:06:43,814
So where I was mobile devices
running on the native app where we

101
00:06:43,814 --> 00:06:49,974
can embed this framework to process
the secure transactions, biometric

102
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:52,344
authentication, and wide acceptance.

103
00:06:52,774 --> 00:06:56,824
So the Apple Pay transactions are
very secure and ensures encrypted

104
00:06:56,825 --> 00:06:59,754
and also tokenized transactions.

105
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:03,454
This protects user data and
prevents fraud in kiosk payments.

106
00:07:03,734 --> 00:07:10,269
So the Bluetooth and the And bluetooth is
something is different and where apple pay

107
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:16,719
Integration is more far advanced right now
for any payment Gateways the face id and

108
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:22,409
touch id add an extra layer for a security
user can authenticate payments quickly and

109
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:30,769
security So wide acceptance so the apple
pay is widely accepted across industries

110
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:38,179
this makes ideal for diverse kiosk
applications so Custom apps for kiosk.

111
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:42,959
So tailored user interface, backend
integration, multi-language support.

112
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:47,699
So custom apps offer in and brand
specific interfaces, this enhanced

113
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:53,009
user experience and reinforce brand
identity, the backend integration.

114
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,269
So these systems are integrated
with, CRM, customer Reporting

115
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,589
Management and ER Pation, program.

116
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:04,329
these systems can be, equip
from the backend to the kiosk.

117
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:09,009
Kiosk can get this real time data to
synchronization and smooth operations.

118
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:10,779
So multi language support.

119
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:14,539
Custom apps can offer
multiple language options.

120
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:19,119
This improves accessibility and
caters to diverse user base.

121
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:24,119
So if something, most, if some locations
where, Spanish speakers are involved

122
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:28,659
and where english is a common language
So we can enable the spanish for the

123
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:35,139
based on the customer base so that they
can do their operations So this will be

124
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,429
helpful for the any type of the customers.

125
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:43,429
So language barriers are no Longer,
stops for kiosk, so it will be a good

126
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:50,399
approach So these custom ios solutions
are Specific to the market if it is a

127
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,319
retail market is something different
and it is a transportation market.

128
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:57,499
It is a different and it is a air travel.

129
00:08:57,499 --> 00:08:58,629
It is something different.

130
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:04,889
it is based on the You know the customer
and how they want to you know process

131
00:09:04,989 --> 00:09:10,229
their Transactions are there, whatever
it is a shipments what we can call it's

132
00:09:10,229 --> 00:09:16,459
a products or whatever So that is very
feasible for developing using i west

133
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:23,809
based kiosk So in retail use, product
in retail use basically every product

134
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:29,199
Has their own skew and the barcode
and And also a skilling unit number.

135
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:34,179
So in product, in the retail use, mostly
the, the customers go with the products

136
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:36,519
browsing, price checking, self checkout.

137
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:40,979
So especially in a product browsing,
they can search with the name of the

138
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:43,379
product and, from the store inventory.

139
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:46,799
so that they can discover the
product and the customer wants.

140
00:09:47,349 --> 00:09:52,579
So it is very easy, easy without,
going to the, sales representative

141
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:54,409
or whoever inside the store.

142
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:57,689
it is easy to know the self service kiosk.

143
00:09:57,689 --> 00:09:59,749
You can get the price.

144
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:04,539
Even they can scan their barcode of
the product and they can easily get the

145
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:10,009
price and availability this reduce the
need for a staff assistance So so the

146
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:14,209
if it is a hundred one fifty customers
inside the store And they are just two

147
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:15,989
or three assistants inside the store.

148
00:10:15,989 --> 00:10:21,939
It is tough to handle everybody So these
self serve kiosks can help a lot during

149
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:27,449
that time So so in self checkout the
contactless payments by apple pay enable

150
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:32,444
Quick Self checkouts, this reduce the
queues and improves customer satisfaction.

151
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:35,974
The self checkout is
more important nowadays.

152
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,974
every business is integrating
a self checkout nowadays.

153
00:10:38,984 --> 00:10:41,694
So it is very useful.

154
00:10:42,194 --> 00:10:46,304
So in a retail market, the kiosks
are also playing a vital role.

155
00:10:46,804 --> 00:10:48,694
So healthcare use cases.

156
00:10:48,704 --> 00:10:51,454
So the future digital check in.

157
00:10:51,474 --> 00:10:52,974
So I talked about already.

158
00:10:53,004 --> 00:10:55,154
This is reduce the wait
time and paper use.

159
00:10:55,474 --> 00:11:00,204
So if it is, if you go to a lab,
So the lab inside, there are a few

160
00:11:00,204 --> 00:11:04,024
technicians and more people are
outside and they can do their stuff.

161
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:08,274
it is hard to, serve all the
customers, with more efficient way.

162
00:11:08,324 --> 00:11:12,064
so the digital chickens will help
and they can check out and they

163
00:11:12,064 --> 00:11:15,674
can just call the name, whoever
in the queue for the next service.

164
00:11:15,724 --> 00:11:19,564
Appointment scheduling same thing
they can reschedule and also they can

165
00:11:19,564 --> 00:11:24,514
come and do on their self without,
waiting for the Representative there.

166
00:11:24,764 --> 00:11:28,054
So the bill payments also streamline
financial transactions and

167
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,584
reduce administration workload.

168
00:11:29,974 --> 00:11:36,664
It is also More important, for you know
without going to the representatives,

169
00:11:36,714 --> 00:11:41,504
customer can do on their own It
is easy stuff In healthcare, also,

170
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:45,144
encouraging more for kiosk development.

171
00:11:45,154 --> 00:11:50,284
This has to definitely has to come
a lot, in the pandemic situation,

172
00:11:50,304 --> 00:11:54,044
people mostly used it contactless
and touch free interactions.

173
00:11:54,524 --> 00:11:58,424
Those are all significant in fact,
importance in the healthcare,

174
00:11:58,494 --> 00:12:00,644
especially than other sectors.

175
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:04,224
So definitely healthcare kiosks and, IOS.

176
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:09,154
enabled are more powerful than
any other devices integrations.

177
00:12:09,654 --> 00:12:11,084
transportation use case.

178
00:12:11,484 --> 00:12:14,964
in the check in, I already talked,
some of the information before.

179
00:12:15,244 --> 00:12:18,934
here is a passenger check in and a
boarding pass and gate information.

180
00:12:18,944 --> 00:12:23,604
This is where, in the transpo in
the transportation industry, it is

181
00:12:23,614 --> 00:12:26,849
something different than here, where
they can check in and, boarding pass.

182
00:12:27,349 --> 00:12:28,399
and get information.

183
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,489
So this is something like in air travel.

184
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:34,659
So the passenger can check in with
their QR codes and their devices

185
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:36,579
speeds up the boarding process.

186
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:41,909
So digital boarding passes are
generated and stored on iOS devices.

187
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:44,099
It eliminates the need of a paper tickets.

188
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:47,154
So definitely these
things are a very helpful.

189
00:12:47,174 --> 00:12:52,114
So if customer forgot their boarding
pass or everything, they'll, this, the

190
00:12:52,114 --> 00:12:56,594
last, during the, in the hurry, buddy,
last minute, to the, to get to the board.

191
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:58,854
So it is easy.

192
00:12:58,854 --> 00:13:02,724
It will show all the gate
information, real time updates.

193
00:13:02,794 --> 00:13:06,224
if some gates are changing or
departure times are changing or

194
00:13:06,264 --> 00:13:09,914
any passenger information or,
Passenger information are incorrect.

195
00:13:09,974 --> 00:13:15,364
Everything will be on your digital
Pass so in transportation industry

196
00:13:15,364 --> 00:13:19,474
also kiosks are very helpful And if you
want to add a bag and you don't need

197
00:13:19,474 --> 00:13:25,054
to go to the counter and you can add
yourself We're just paying using Apple

198
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:27,124
Pay or any of the payment gateways.

199
00:13:27,164 --> 00:13:32,074
You can do it by manual So you can just
download the tag and you just attach the

200
00:13:32,074 --> 00:13:39,064
tag and just check in your luggage so it
definitely, this is also a good, place, in

201
00:13:39,064 --> 00:13:41,414
the transportation industry, kiosk usage.

202
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:45,784
mostly nowadays the, airports are
more busier after the pandemic.

203
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:52,194
So definitely the kiosk has to increase
more in, in the airline industry as well.

204
00:13:52,694 --> 00:13:57,074
So hospitality use cases, so
digital room keys, digital

205
00:13:57,074 --> 00:13:58,664
concierge, and express ticket.

206
00:13:58,974 --> 00:14:03,284
So guests can be, use their iOS
devices as their room keys, this

207
00:14:03,284 --> 00:14:05,614
enhance security and convenience.

208
00:14:06,004 --> 00:14:10,184
So in the hotels, some of the hotels, they
introduced, they are sharing their, the

209
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:14,834
wallet, yeah, they're sharing the token
to the wallet and it will be a created,

210
00:14:14,934 --> 00:14:20,054
one pass and where you can use the pass
to, get into the, your room, hotel room.

211
00:14:20,554 --> 00:14:23,374
the kiosk offers restaurant
recommendations and booking services,

212
00:14:23,374 --> 00:14:26,994
improves guest experience and,
increases revenue opportunities.

213
00:14:27,554 --> 00:14:28,774
the express checkouts.

214
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:32,664
I covered already some contactless
payments that are quick and,

215
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:36,644
easy checkout and reduces front
desk use and improves efficiency.

216
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:41,014
These are also secure, secure
payments and, seamless transactions.

217
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:46,794
So in hospitality also, there are a lot
of, significant, importance in for kiosks.

218
00:14:47,294 --> 00:14:49,204
So feature of iOS kiosks.

219
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:50,424
This is very interesting.

220
00:14:50,464 --> 00:14:54,524
So AI, everybody knows, so
artificial intelligence.

221
00:14:54,534 --> 00:14:59,444
So once this is came into the picture,
iOS can incorporate with a advanced

222
00:14:59,444 --> 00:15:01,384
AI and personalized interaction.

223
00:15:01,404 --> 00:15:04,254
This will enhance user experience
and productive services.

224
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:09,749
this is very advanced, topic and,
definitely need more research, what

225
00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:13,579
needs for the customer and what
are the limitations that we can,

226
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:16,709
commit while developing the kiosk.

227
00:15:17,229 --> 00:15:21,349
So another thing, augmented reality,
this feature will include immersive

228
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:23,209
product demonstration and navigation.

229
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:26,039
This will revolutionize detail
and informational kiosk.

230
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:30,399
So IOT connectivity, kiosk will
seamlessly integrate with IOT devices.

231
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:31,539
This will enable.

232
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:34,599
comprehensive smart environment
control and monitoring.

233
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:41,329
So now every home has their smart sensors
and every, home has a different sensors

234
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:48,089
and for heating and HVAC control and also
the light, lights and fans and everything.

235
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:50,019
it is equipped with a smart home.

236
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:51,549
the sensors are everywhere.

237
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:57,929
It is keeping connecting with the iOS
devices and also we can see the cameras

238
00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:03,709
also can be connected to the, iOS
devices and where we can, remotely see

239
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:08,529
and somewhere we travel also we can see
what's happening in front of our house.

240
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:13,349
so these iOS devices are, so much
importance in the daily life.

241
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:16,309
yeah, this is all, mostly covered.

242
