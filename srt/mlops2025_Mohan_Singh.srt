1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,170
Is Moning from AWS, and first off,
I wanna thank conference 42 for

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,510
the opportunity to be here today.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,980
In this talk, we are going to explore
how AI first platforms are reshaping

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,140
lops, moving from manual reactive
operations to autonomous self-healing,

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,030
and continuously improving systems.

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,330
By the end of this session, you'll
have a clear understanding of the

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,619
building blocks behind self wheeling
infrastructure, intelligent scaling,

8
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,799
and auto autonomous code modernization.

9
00:00:28,299 --> 00:00:30,759
Let's take a step back and
look at how MOPS has evolved.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,950
In the early days, it was very manual.

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,300
Engineers were literally on call
at 2:00 AM trying to put out fires.

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,379
Whenever pipeline broke.

13
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:39,670
It was stressful.

14
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,950
Reactive work then came automation.

15
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:42,879
It helped a lot.

16
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:46,989
Workflows were faster, errors
were reduced, but it still needed

17
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:48,339
constant human supervision.

18
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,379
Now we are inferring something new.

19
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:55,030
Autonomous m lops systems that
learn, adapt, and fix themselves.

20
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:55,780
No more.

21
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,059
2:00 AM wake up calls,
no more firefighting.

22
00:00:58,539 --> 00:00:59,860
That's the real game changer.

23
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:02,470
So the question is how do we get there?

24
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,620
I like to break it down into three
pillars, which we'll explore next, the

25
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,485
three pillars of autonomous m lops.

26
00:01:10,275 --> 00:01:13,455
First pillar is self-healing
infrastructure systems that can

27
00:01:13,455 --> 00:01:15,315
detect issues and fix themselves.

28
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:19,215
The second is intelligent
scaling, anticipating demand,

29
00:01:19,395 --> 00:01:20,655
and scaling proactively.

30
00:01:21,135 --> 00:01:24,615
And the third is automated
code modernization systems that

31
00:01:24,615 --> 00:01:27,945
consciously evolve through AI
driven refactoring and patching.

32
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:33,315
Think of this like a human immune system,
detect, respond, and adapt new threats.

33
00:01:33,975 --> 00:01:35,985
Let's try deeper into the first page.

34
00:01:36,485 --> 00:01:39,305
Self-healing infrastructure,
a self-healing system

35
00:01:39,455 --> 00:01:40,895
that has four key points.

36
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:46,935
Monitoring that uses ml to spot
nominals diagnosis that pinpoints

37
00:01:46,995 --> 00:01:51,795
root causes across logs and signals
resolution with automated playbooks

38
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,175
and a feedbacking that makes the
system smarter at every incident.

39
00:01:55,895 --> 00:01:57,485
It's like an autopilot in airplanes.

40
00:01:57,935 --> 00:02:01,645
It doesn't just alert the pilot, it
stabilizes the system immediately.

41
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,640
Real world use cases.

42
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,470
Observability driven AI that detects
certain deviations, cross service

43
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,700
intelligence that understand dependencies
and automated patch where systems

44
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,410
fixed vulnerabilities themselves.

45
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,150
These speak themselves for themselves.

46
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,760
NR reduced by 90% and up to 80%
of routine operations eliminated

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,040
once infrastructure heals itself.

48
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,200
The next step is scaling intelligent.

49
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,310
So how do we actually
implement self hearing systems?

50
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,130
It starts with observability driven AI

51
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,500
tools that don't just monitor, but
actively detect subtle deviations

52
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,970
before to become incidents.

53
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,740
Next, cross service intelligence
systems that understand dependencies

54
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,380
across services, not just with inbox.

55
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,930
That means failures are diagnosed
in context, not in isolation.

56
00:02:51,575 --> 00:02:55,325
And finally, automated patching
infrastructure that can find and fix

57
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:58,555
vulnerabilities on its own without
waiting for human intervention.

58
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:02,155
The results are powerful and we
see recovery times reduced by

59
00:03:02,155 --> 00:03:06,115
almost 60% and as much as 55% of
routine operation tasks linear.

60
00:03:06,615 --> 00:03:09,165
Once your infrastructure can
heal itself, the natural step

61
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:10,785
is to make it scale intelligent.

62
00:03:11,285 --> 00:03:13,325
Traditional auto-scaling is reactive.

63
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:16,265
It waits until demand
spikes before responding.

64
00:03:16,835 --> 00:03:20,225
That's like s slamming on the brakes
after you've already run the red line.

65
00:03:20,525 --> 00:03:22,835
It works, but it's late and inefficient.

66
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:27,155
With predictive resource management,
we flip the model using analytics

67
00:03:27,155 --> 00:03:30,485
and machine learning system
forecast demand hours or even days.

68
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:35,015
This allows resources to be provisioned
proactively and just as importantly

69
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,905
scaled down when they're no longer needed.

70
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:41,465
The impact is clear, better
performance, lower costs and resources

71
00:03:41,495 --> 00:03:44,915
aligned with business priorities,
not just technical triggers.

72
00:03:45,415 --> 00:03:47,839
So how does predictive
scaling actually work?

73
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,750
It follows five steps.

74
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:55,570
Collect telemetry, not CPU or memory, but
also request patterns and business matrix.

75
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,820
Analyze with ML or AI time
series models, uncover S circles,

76
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,860
correlations, even seasonality.

77
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,180
Forecast the demand.

78
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,430
Produce predictions from the next
few minutes to several days out.

79
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:13,530
Plan resources turning forecast
into precise allocation strategies,

80
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:18,420
automation, or automate the execution
using infrastructure and scope and

81
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,760
feedback loops to scale in real time.

82
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,655
It's a closed loop system that
gets smarter with every itration.

83
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,335
Ensuring resources are always
aligned with the impact.

84
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:32,465
Now let's shift to the third
pillar, AI driven code evolution.

85
00:04:33,184 --> 00:04:36,694
Think of your code base, not as
something static, but as a living system.

86
00:04:36,965 --> 00:04:41,465
With AI code can now self
optimize, self-cure and self adapt.

87
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:45,664
This means automat refactoring
or performance proactive patching

88
00:04:45,664 --> 00:04:49,264
before vulnerabilities are
exploited or continuous adoption

89
00:04:49,384 --> 00:04:51,004
of emerging risk practices.

90
00:04:51,064 --> 00:04:53,914
All without waiting for
manual intervention.

91
00:04:54,784 --> 00:04:56,944
This is powered by large language models.

92
00:04:57,359 --> 00:04:59,819
Advanced code analysis and
reinforcement learning.

93
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:03,689
Instead of developers constantly
chasing technical data, the system

94
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:07,479
reduce reduces on its own, allowing
teams to focus on innovation.

95
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:12,344
At AWS my team used to spend around
30% of the time in cleaning, migration

96
00:05:12,724 --> 00:05:14,465
or migration detected itself.

97
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:16,585
So how do we actually modernize code?

98
00:05:17,085 --> 00:05:18,284
There are three main approaches.

99
00:05:18,434 --> 00:05:20,204
First, performance optimization.

100
00:05:20,384 --> 00:05:23,564
AI detect bottlenecks, applies,
fixes, and even validates

101
00:05:23,564 --> 00:05:25,215
improvements through AB testing.

102
00:05:25,634 --> 00:05:30,134
Second, dependency management, autonomous
systems assess risk and libraries

103
00:05:30,224 --> 00:05:34,094
flag issues and perform safe upgrades
without waiting for path cycles.

104
00:05:34,574 --> 00:05:36,314
And third architecture revolution.

105
00:05:36,824 --> 00:05:39,789
ML power tools recommended and
sometimes implement structural

106
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:41,469
improvements as systems grow.

107
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:43,080
The payoff is huge.

108
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,100
Like we have seen 90% fewer
vulnerabilities, 30 to 50% performance

109
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:52,680
gains, and a 30% dramatic reduction in
maintenance overhead for just my team.

110
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,469
So what's the real business impact of
auto autonomous lops organizations?

111
00:05:57,469 --> 00:06:01,490
Adopting the systems has seen
operational overhead cut by 75%,

112
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,099
recovery times reduced by almost 90%.

113
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:06,530
Infrastructure costs lowered by now 35%.

114
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,599
These aren't small,
incremental games gains.

115
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:14,249
They their step function
improvements, unlocking efficiencies,

116
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:17,249
bilities, and agility all at once.

117
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,699
That's why autonomous lops isn't
just a technical evolution,

118
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:22,349
it's a business transformation.

119
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,309
The journey to AutonoMe
doesn't happen overnight.

120
00:06:25,549 --> 00:06:29,749
It's phased progression
usually over 18 to 36 months.

121
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,999
Phase one is foundation get
observability in place and

122
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:34,469
standardized infrastructure as code.

123
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:37,634
Without good telemetry,
autonomic cannot work.

124
00:06:38,114 --> 00:06:42,134
Phase two is augmentation layer
in AI powered monitoring, anomaly

125
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:46,094
detection, and early predictive
scaling, often with human percent.

126
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:51,044
Phase three is autonomy systems not
handling remediation and predictive

127
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:55,364
scaling with minimal intervention
plus early code optimization.

128
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,074
Phase four is evolution.

129
00:06:57,554 --> 00:07:00,674
Self-improving systems that
adapt architecture through

130
00:07:00,674 --> 00:07:01,419
reinforcement learning.

131
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,129
The key point is that each phase
delivers measurable value on its

132
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:09,210
own, so the benefits start well
before full autonomy is reached.

133
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,640
Now looking ahead, several trends will
push autonomous lops even further.

134
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,530
First, multi-agent systems.

135
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,340
Instead of one AI making decisions,
multiple agents collaborate to

136
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,750
manage infrastructure dynamic.

137
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:26,390
Second, explainable AI operations or
x AI ops, bringing transparency and

138
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,520
accountability to autonomous decisions.

139
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,640
Third cross-platform optimization.

140
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,330
AI that can seamlessly shift and
optimize workloads across hybrid

141
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,800
and multi-cloud environments.

142
00:07:37,354 --> 00:07:41,284
Finally, continuous learning
infrastructure systems that don't just

143
00:07:41,284 --> 00:07:45,424
learn from local incidents, but from
global patterns across industries.

144
00:07:45,784 --> 00:07:50,645
The takeaway are self-healing,
intelligent scaling and code modernization

145
00:07:50,734 --> 00:07:55,775
are only the be what's coming as
fully autonomous cloud ecosystems.

146
00:07:56,275 --> 00:08:00,840
To wrap up, thank you all for joining
me on this journey into autonomous mops.

147
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,719
I hope the talks gives you the vision
of what's possible and a roadmap to

148
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,970
start your own journey towards Autonom.

149
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:11,960
I'd love to hear the conversation, so
please feel free to reach out to me.

150
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:13,309
Thank you.
