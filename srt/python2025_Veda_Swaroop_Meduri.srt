1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:00,410
Hello.

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,420
So today I will go with AI
healthcare in transforming patient

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,060
care through predictive analytics.

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,340
The global healthcare AI market
valuation has reached to 15.

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,619
1 billion.

6
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:14,709
This presentation explored the
integration of artificial intelligence

7
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:18,619
in healthcare systems, focusing
on implementing the strategies and

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:23,510
outcomes, specifically across diagnostic
enhancements and treatment optimization.

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,510
We will delve into the technical
architecture, data management,

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:32,290
and predictive health capabilities
of AI in healthcare, while also

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,860
addressing critical implementation
challenges and ethical considerations.

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,329
AI driven diagnosis enhancements have,
we can categorize into two parts,

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,540
increased accuracy and reduced cost.

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,910
Advanced machine learning algorithms
have demonstrated exceptional diagnostic

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,930
precision with AI power system achieving
sensitivity rates between 87 to 98.

16
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,669
3 percent across the diverse medical
specialties, significantly outperforming

17
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,469
the traditional diagnostic methodologies.

18
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,279
The other category is reduced cost.

19
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:07,960
Natural language processing and AI
technologies have proven transformative

20
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,199
in healthcare administration,
enabling hospitals to streamline

21
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:15,789
operational Process and reduce
administrative expenditures by up to 3.

22
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,759
8 million annually, while
simultaneously enhancing overall

23
00:01:19,899 --> 00:01:20,939
healthcare delivery and efficiency.

24
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,329
The predictive analytics have the
main another goal is identifying

25
00:01:25,339 --> 00:01:27,189
the high risk patients in advance.

26
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:29,159
we can categorize these into two parts.

27
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,063
The first one is predictive modeling.

28
00:01:31,063 --> 00:01:35,439
In the predictive modeling, advanced
predictive analytics model leverages

29
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,409
machine learning to precisely
identify the high risk patients with

30
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:44,309
an impressive of almost close to 90
percent of accuracy, enabling healthcare

31
00:01:44,309 --> 00:01:46,852
providers to implement the targeted
and preemptive care strategies.

32
00:01:46,852 --> 00:01:47,759
Next slide, please.

33
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:53,529
The other category falls under this
year is reduced readmissions by

34
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,659
intelligently analyzing the patient data.

35
00:01:55,809 --> 00:01:59,509
These innovations models have
successfully reduced hospitalized

36
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,229
readmission rates by 28%.

37
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:05,419
Significantly improve the patient
outcomes and streamline the

38
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,819
healthcare resource allocation.

39
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:11,329
The next category is we're talking
about processing medical data.

40
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:17,229
So we can While processing the data
we can how we are how the data volume

41
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:23,439
and how the data is accurate Once
while coming to the data volume the

42
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:30,334
contemporary healthcare infrastructure
process and Intra 200 structured and

43
00:02:30,374 --> 00:02:34,574
unstructured medical data points per
patient, generating a massive of 1.

44
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,444
5 petabytes of comprehensive
medical information annually.

45
00:02:37,944 --> 00:02:40,194
Sustaining a rigorous 99.

46
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:44,224
2 percent data accuracy rate, mission
critical of ensuring the reliability of AI

47
00:02:44,224 --> 00:02:47,334
algorithms and safeguarding the patient's
safety in an aesthetic, sophisticated,

48
00:02:47,724 --> 00:02:49,424
multi layered data management system.

49
00:02:49,924 --> 00:02:53,974
The another important thing is for
the while generating these models

50
00:02:54,024 --> 00:02:58,664
that AI algorithms are processing
the medical images predictions is the

51
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,134
one of the very important category.

52
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,404
This is the revolution category.

53
00:03:03,614 --> 00:03:07,234
One of the revolution categories,
image processing, conventional neural

54
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:14,424
networks analyzes 400, 000 medical
images, leveraging advanced deep

55
00:03:14,474 --> 00:03:19,794
learning techniques to detect the Subtle
pathological abnormalities with 95.

56
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:21,554
8 percent diagnostic accuracy.

57
00:03:21,564 --> 00:03:23,934
Dramatically accelerating
the clinical assessment and

58
00:03:23,934 --> 00:03:25,714
early disease identification.

59
00:03:26,214 --> 00:03:27,104
Outcome prediction.

60
00:03:27,814 --> 00:03:29,824
Sophisticated gradient boosting.

61
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:33,849
assembles models, integrate
complex patient data to predict

62
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:35,939
clinical outcomes up to 93.

63
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:41,669
4 percent precision, enabling clinical
clinics to develop the personalized

64
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:45,839
treatment strategies and practically
manage their potential health risks.

65
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:47,759
Implementation of challenges.

66
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:54,219
So for this category, I would
like to say around Two categories

67
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:57,149
I can say one is the data breach
and AI protocol vulnerabilities.

68
00:03:57,999 --> 00:04:01,089
So coming to the data breach,
healthcare data breaches have escalated

69
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:03,589
dramatically with a struggling 37.

70
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:06,829
2 percent annual increase, exposing
critical patient information and

71
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:08,559
undermining trust in digital health.

72
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:15,174
At the same time, AI protocol
vulnerabilities are Alarmingly, 74

73
00:04:15,174 --> 00:04:19,534
percent of healthcare organizations face
significant of AI protocol weakness,

74
00:04:19,704 --> 00:04:24,414
demanding urgent implementation of
comprehensive security framework and

75
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,274
strengthening the ethical safeguard.

76
00:04:26,774 --> 00:04:30,874
Ethical implementation of accuracy,
disparity, and transparency is one of the,

77
00:04:31,174 --> 00:04:32,864
categories in the ethical implications.

78
00:04:32,894 --> 00:04:36,264
The first one is, we'll go
with the accuracy disparities.

79
00:04:36,764 --> 00:04:42,234
AI diagnostic algorithm demonstrates
significant demographic Variability

80
00:04:42,234 --> 00:04:45,674
with accuracy rates flanging up
to 34 percent across the different

81
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:50,644
population segments, revealing critical
system biases that could compromise

82
00:04:50,644 --> 00:04:52,124
equitability healthcare delivery.

83
00:04:52,744 --> 00:04:53,864
Transparency and trust.

84
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:57,644
A mere 38 percent of healthcare
providers report feeling adequately

85
00:04:58,094 --> 00:05:01,994
prepared to articulate the reasoning
behind aid driven medical decisions.

86
00:05:02,294 --> 00:05:06,994
Understanding the urgent need for an
interpretable and accountable artificial

87
00:05:07,154 --> 00:05:08,974
intelligence system in clinical settings.

88
00:05:09,474 --> 00:05:13,369
So we can divide the whole, future
of healthcare into two parts.

89
00:05:13,869 --> 00:05:18,109
So we can go with precision medicine
and predictive analytics and patienting.

90
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:23,269
These three topics we have already
discussed in the previous slide.

91
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:26,569
So we just categorized
in a pyramid of triangle.

92
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:31,619
While we go with the precision of
medicine, so trial ring treatment

93
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:35,359
to individual genetic profile
and clinical data or targeted

94
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:37,069
therapeutic interventions.

95
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:41,529
Predictive analytics, leveraging
machine learning to forecast disease

96
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:46,479
progression, potential health
risk, and unprecedented accuracy.

97
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:49,429
The last one is the patient engagement.

98
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:52,569
Empowering the patients through
personalized health insights,

99
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:54,859
real time monitoring, and
proactive wellness strategy.

100
00:05:54,859 --> 00:06:01,369
The future of AI healthcare transcends
traditional medical paradigms Promising

101
00:06:01,369 --> 00:06:06,249
hyper personalized care plans, predictive
early disease detection, and dynamically

102
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:10,329
optimized treatment outcomes as AI
technologies continuously evolve.

103
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:11,709
Key takeaways.

104
00:06:12,299 --> 00:06:16,579
I would like to consider that these,
I consider into three parts like

105
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:20,659
Potential A, Potential Implementation
Challenge and Collaborative Approaches.

106
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:24,769
While we go with the A, Potential
A represents a transformative

107
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:28,899
force in healthcare capable of
dramatically enhancing diagnostic

108
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:31,928
patient, personalizing treatment
protocols and significantly improving

109
00:06:31,928 --> 00:06:34,839
the patient care outcomes through
advanced predictive analysis.

110
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:39,729
Successfully integrated AI requires
comprehensive strategies, addressing

111
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:43,769
complex data security risks, resolving
ethical dilemmas, and ensuring

112
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:47,459
algorithm transparency to maintain
patient trust and healthcare integrity.

113
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:50,139
The final one is like
collaborative approach.

114
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,689
Full potential demand strategy
collaboration among the healthcare

115
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:57,619
professionals, technological
innovators, and regulatory experts

116
00:06:57,619 --> 00:07:02,599
to develop responsible, adaptive,
and patient centric ecosystems.

117
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:06,789
Next steps of embracing
AI and better future.

118
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:12,779
Develop strategic AI infrastructure
by allocating dedicated resource and

119
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,819
recruiting specialized talent to design,
implement, and continuously improve

120
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,589
the AI driven healthcare solution.

121
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:23,129
Create comprehensive software security and
ethical framework that ensure the patient

122
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:27,987
data protection, algorithms, algorithmic
transparency, and adherence to the highest

123
00:07:27,987 --> 00:07:30,149
standards of medical AI governance.

124
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:31,649
Foster AI driven healthcare.

125
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:36,149
Interdisciplinary collaborations through
structured knowledge sharing platforms,

126
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:41,577
connecting to healthcare providers,
AI researchers and technologists, and

127
00:07:41,577 --> 00:07:45,649
policy makers accelerate innovative
and responsible AI integration.

128
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:50,769
The last one is launch comprehensive
patient education initiatives that

129
00:07:50,859 --> 00:07:56,119
demystify AI technologies, demonstrate
tangible benefits, and build trust

130
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:59,149
through transparent communication and
interactive engagement strategies.

131
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:04,559
Embracing AI transformative healthcare
future, all transcend mere two

132
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:09,289
technologies innovation its revolutionary
approach to the patient care.

133
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:14,249
By strategically deploying predictive
analytics and intelligent treatment

134
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:19,125
protocols, we are reimagining
healthcare as a proactive personalized

135
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:24,199
and ecosystem that anticipate in
this individual health trajectories.

136
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,559
Mitigates diagnostic.

137
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:30,209
Uncertainty, uncertainties and
deliver precision medicine tailored

138
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:35,049
and unique genetic landscapes and
comprehensive health narratives.

139
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:40,119
Our mission is harness as an empowering
collaborative tool that amplifies

140
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:41,479
healthcare professional capabilities.

141
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:45,059
Dramatically improves the patient
outcomes and construct a more

142
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:49,729
equitable, intelligent and
compensate the medical future.

143
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,469
This is all about the today demonstration.

144
00:08:52,469 --> 00:08:53,359
Thank you very much.
