1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,819
This is Rajesh Kugila, I am going
to talk about, transforming bulk

2
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:10,339
oil and gas logistics with IOT,
leveraging, ISOIL TSW for digital

3
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:12,789
innovation and operational efficiency.

4
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:15,339
thanks for joining me today.

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,969
Here are the things, we are going
to discuss the table of contents of,

6
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:26,599
this, ISOIL TSW, industry context and
challenges, introduction to, ISOIL

7
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:32,369
TSW, core functionality of, TSW,
quantitative impact, alignment with

8
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:39,499
the industry trends, benefits of ISOIL
TSW, case study, operational impact,

9
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:41,779
feature outlook, and conclusion.

10
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:47,789
So here we will discuss about the industry
challenges in oil and gas industry.

11
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,049
The oil and gas logistics
landscapes of the global oil and

12
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:53,739
gas industry is valuated at 3.

13
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:57,659
3 trillions as of 2023.

14
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:03,819
Inefficiency in logistics can lead to
substantial financial losses, affecting

15
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:06,459
probability, sorry, profitability.

16
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:13,199
A mid sized refinery processing 250, 000
barrels per day, valuated at 20 million.

17
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:20,424
a daily can incur massive losses from
delays or errors increasing Reliance

18
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:25,874
on automation and integration to
manage complex multimodal logistics

19
00:01:26,374 --> 00:01:32,634
so introduction to isr tsw So what
is, I-S-R-T-S-W, what are the core

20
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,354
functionalities, that TSW offers?

21
00:01:35,624 --> 00:01:36,974
So we'll discuss here.

22
00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:43,024
the, ISR, traders and s is an advanced
logistics management software.

23
00:01:43,454 --> 00:01:47,284
this basically, will use it for the
nomination and ticketing in the.

24
00:01:47,784 --> 00:01:49,754
Soil, bulk product movement.

25
00:01:50,314 --> 00:01:55,194
So the core functionalities includes,
nomination management for product

26
00:01:55,194 --> 00:02:01,114
scheduling, electronic ticketing for
accurate documentation, multi modal

27
00:02:01,144 --> 00:02:05,394
transport systems, it's also support
multiple multi modal transport system

28
00:02:05,404 --> 00:02:10,074
like rail, pipeline, and marine,
and inventory reconciliation to

29
00:02:10,104 --> 00:02:14,174
prevent discrepancies, integration
with the terminal invoicing system.

30
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:18,994
Designed to streamline bulk sales,
purchases, and transfers with

31
00:02:19,614 --> 00:02:21,554
unmatched accuracy and speed.

32
00:02:22,054 --> 00:02:26,264
The core functionalities of DSW
are key features and capabilities.

33
00:02:26,824 --> 00:02:31,404
Nomination management, ticketing
system, multi modal support,

34
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,414
inventory, reconciliation.

35
00:02:34,004 --> 00:02:36,634
we'll discuss, detail about
the nomination management.

36
00:02:36,734 --> 00:02:40,834
the nomination management, basically
it's a scheduling, tool for the,

37
00:02:41,054 --> 00:02:42,994
bulk, refined, crude products.

38
00:02:43,854 --> 00:02:46,274
Either as a purchase a sale or transfer.

39
00:02:46,764 --> 00:02:52,124
So in real time updates and coordinates
across the stakeholders So the nomination

40
00:02:52,134 --> 00:02:56,864
management system it's real time updates
and coordinates across the stakeholders

41
00:02:56,864 --> 00:02:58,832
Hinders high transaction value.

42
00:02:58,832 --> 00:03:03,884
So the scalability and the ticketing
system of the automated ticketing

43
00:03:03,914 --> 00:03:09,039
system reduced Documentation errors
by 95 percent and supports processing

44
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,099
of up to 10, 000 daily tickets.

45
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:14,069
Multimodal support.

46
00:03:14,649 --> 00:03:18,639
Unifield logistics management
for rail, pipeline, and marine.

47
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:23,049
The inventory consolidation
achieves 99 percent reduction

48
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,269
in Inventory discrepancies.

49
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:30,449
We will discuss here the quantitative
impact of TSW on operations.

50
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:36,829
So error reduction, 95 percent reduction
in documentation errors, efficiency

51
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:43,639
gains, processes up to 10, 000 daily
tickets, inventory accuracy, 1 percent

52
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:49,789
improvement, translates to 1 million in
annual savings for midsize refineries.

53
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:55,119
Reconstruction time reduced by 60
percent enabling faster decisions making

54
00:03:55,619 --> 00:04:01,409
invoice processing time reduced by 70
percent improving financial efficiency.

55
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:06,509
So alignment with the industry
trends, here are the industrial

56
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:10,339
trends driving automation and
integration, automation technologies,

57
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:13,369
integration technologies, TSW role.

58
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,339
So automation technologies market
value projected to grow to 22.

59
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:27,079
1 billion by 2027 Enhances safety reduces
human errors and boosts productivity by

60
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:33,399
up to 25 integration technologies cloud
applications market expected to reach 10.

61
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:41,249
9 billion by 2027 tsw role integrates
seamlessly with the existing inventory and

62
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,239
invoicing system reducing reconciliation
and processing time significantly

63
00:04:46,739 --> 00:04:52,799
Benefits of, ISR TSW, the business
benefits, enhanced accuracy, improved

64
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:58,709
efficiency, better visibility,
regulatory compliance, cost reduction.

65
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:04,059
So enhanced accuracy reduces human
errors, improving reliability in

66
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,569
operations, and improved efficiency
enables teams to manage more

67
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:10,939
transactional with less effort.

68
00:05:11,814 --> 00:05:15,944
Better visibility, real time
updates reduce inventory holding

69
00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:18,164
cost by up to 15 percent.

70
00:05:18,614 --> 00:05:25,499
Regulatory compliance minimizes compliance
risk reducing associated cost by 30 to 50%

71
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:31,289
cost reduction optimizes logistics process
achieving significant cost savings.

72
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:36,179
Here's the case study for the
operational impact, the TSW in action.

73
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:41,229
A midsized refinery processing two
50,000 barrels per day requests a

74
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:46,509
robust logistics solution to overcome
inefficiency in scheduling, ticketing,

75
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:48,909
and reconciliation improvements.

76
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:54,409
Improvements achieved with the TSW
inventory reconciliation reduces to.

77
00:05:54,764 --> 00:05:59,964
30 minutes and 10 saved per ticket
with the electronic ticketing.

78
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:05,744
Real time visibility enhances decision
making and reduces operational delays.

79
00:06:06,244 --> 00:06:08,654
Shaping the future of,
oil and gas logistics.

80
00:06:09,284 --> 00:06:11,534
Digital transformation goals, unlock 2.

81
00:06:11,534 --> 00:06:17,404
5 trillion in value by 2030
through efficiency and automation.

82
00:06:17,864 --> 00:06:23,444
technology adoption trends, greater
reliance on AI, cloud technologies,

83
00:06:23,474 --> 00:06:25,374
and sustainability focused solutions.

84
00:06:25,374 --> 00:06:27,924
And TSW's role in the future.

85
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:35,039
Continued evolution to meet rising
demands for faster, smarter, and more

86
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:42,529
sustainable logistics and solutions
is the conclusion of ISOIL TSW, the

87
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:45,219
