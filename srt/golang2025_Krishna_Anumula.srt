1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:00,930
Hey.

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:01,260
Hi.

3
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,400
Good evening everyone.

4
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,870
This is Krishna again.

5
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,440
I'm here to talk about my recent
implementation, elevating security

6
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,450
standards for my databases.

7
00:00:09,819 --> 00:00:13,979
I'm an Oracle database engineer, and I
have like almost 13 years of experience

8
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:18,029
and I was, I did lot of encryption
process and I recently implemented.

9
00:00:18,299 --> 00:00:22,470
These hardware security module
delivering military grade encryption

10
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,679
and regulatory campaigns with
maintaining the system performance.

11
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:31,019
And nowadays we are seeing lot of security
breaches and cyber threats are happening.

12
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,000
So encryption is more important for each
and every company and each databases.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,760
So here are the few things which we
automated and elevated the process

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,040
and improvise the databases, with
the help of these HSM encryption.

15
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,560
And if we go on to my, my project, right?

16
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,040
the challenges which I face
solutions and the results, right?

17
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,375
here, we, I got an opportunity
to implement these security

18
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:01,105
standards for almost 50 databases.

19
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:06,330
So we, we started working on this for
one database, like how to safeguard

20
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,679
the data, like customer information,
that, and personal data and social

21
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:13,950
security, healthcare information,
which are all, everything is updated.

22
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,119
The personal, like home addresses,
everything is there on the databases,

23
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:20,130
the cl for the client, for the
client details and everything.

24
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,929
So we want to safeguard that.

25
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:25,369
We streamline the process
and the solution we deployed.

26
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:29,879
We deployed hardware security model
with at once encryption algorithm and

27
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:32,489
robust key management infrastructure.

28
00:01:32,949 --> 00:01:35,739
here, if we go onto the,
like HMS encryption, right?

29
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:41,229
The hardware security module include
the stronger security compliance and

30
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:46,109
regulatory, requirements, and, secure
key management performance, scalability.

31
00:01:46,699 --> 00:01:50,959
Cloud and hybrid security and
protection critical application,

32
00:01:51,169 --> 00:01:52,459
which includes everything.

33
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:58,849
which results achieving comprehensive data
security, procedure and full regularities

34
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:02,719
and comprehensives, while maintaining
the optimal system performances.

35
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:08,159
So with that, like we, we improve, we
improve system performance a lot and,

36
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:12,840
We improve system performance a lot
and the, where they're trying to access

37
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,490
the data, it is also streamlined and
everything like the, if we jump onto

38
00:02:17,495 --> 00:02:22,024
the, the how we, streamline the process
which we implement, like the process.

39
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:25,979
To install the process and the,
the project and everything, right?

40
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:28,099
we did it like everything's automate.

41
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:31,969
We automated the process, like
to involve the less downtime.

42
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,559
So here are that hardware security
modules, which I want to explain in

43
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:38,959
detail like temporary register hardware.

44
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:39,994
Hardware.

45
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:44,499
it is a pure physical security
application with multilayered.

46
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:50,159
defines that activi actively detect
and re respond to unauthorized physical

47
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:56,159
and electrical infrastructure attempts
like after, after this implementation.

48
00:02:56,169 --> 00:03:00,989
What happens, like the unwanted users,
which they can able to access the data.

49
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,459
for example, if you build any
database in the company, right?

50
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,420
There are a default user which order,
which we, which imp Which can create

51
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,589
automatically in the databases, with the
sta like with the security standards.

52
00:03:12,589 --> 00:03:17,689
So if any of the user, like all user
with the employee information and the

53
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:21,444
customer information are the member
of the company, if they are a current

54
00:03:21,444 --> 00:03:23,434
member, the data will be stored.

55
00:03:23,434 --> 00:03:25,929
And if they are all member, we will be.

56
00:03:26,324 --> 00:03:28,839
Locking that account,
deactivate the account.

57
00:03:28,894 --> 00:03:32,194
Like same with the employee information,
deactivating that employee information,

58
00:03:32,194 --> 00:03:36,604
the old information and storing the
information in the IV database like that.

59
00:03:36,654 --> 00:03:41,674
we encrypted everything and data masking
the personal, like personal credit card

60
00:03:41,674 --> 00:03:43,384
information, the payment process, right?

61
00:03:43,694 --> 00:03:46,274
we must the data with the
help of these encryption.

62
00:03:46,524 --> 00:03:51,734
so if we tone the data from prod to a
non-pro, so the customer or the user

63
00:03:52,094 --> 00:03:55,874
or developer, application developer,
they cannot see the data, like data

64
00:03:55,874 --> 00:03:57,764
bridges can be halted with that.

65
00:03:57,764 --> 00:04:02,109
So we mastered, all the credit card
information from the prod to non pros.

66
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:06,454
So the security key, secure key
management, so isolated and.

67
00:04:06,804 --> 00:04:12,119
we, we, we isolated cryptographic
process environment that, safeguard

68
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,669
the entire key life cycle.

69
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:19,079
So whenever we implement, the keys,
which we stored in the, in the

70
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,339
cybersecurity level, we store those
keys in, in, in a cryptographic base.

71
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:25,569
So no one cannot.

72
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:32,049
It's more than we, we select more than 50,
more than 50 words to get the passwords.

73
00:04:32,049 --> 00:04:35,559
So it has to be algorithm,
completely cryptographic algorithm,

74
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:39,799
which automatically change,
with the help of the, like with

75
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:41,629
the help of cybersecurity keys.

76
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:47,524
And it rotates automatically to avoid the
downtime and to get, the ballots safe.

77
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:51,369
and if we jump onto the next point,
the regulatory compliance that

78
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:58,609
facilitates, The, data protection
standards includes G-D-G-D-P-R.

79
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:03,309
It means, general data protection re,
regulations, which contains the data

80
00:05:03,309 --> 00:05:08,619
collection and processing and P-C-I-D-S-S,
it's a payment card in, industry.

81
00:05:08,619 --> 00:05:11,919
The data security standards,
we follow the process.

82
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,479
And HIPA, it's a, it's healthcare.

83
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:14,639
Healthcare.

84
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:18,939
Health insurance, poverty, health
insurance process and everything.

85
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:23,369
The health insurance information,
the HS HSA account, the PPO and

86
00:05:23,369 --> 00:05:26,669
everything, the process of the
employee information, we stored the

87
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:31,729
data to, To mask that in info, to mask
and, secure those information also.

88
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:34,684
it's an internal control
for the financial report.

89
00:05:35,144 --> 00:05:39,454
so it's audit, it mostly use for the
audit team, for the audit databases to

90
00:05:39,454 --> 00:05:43,054
audit the audit, the databases who all
are accessing the data and everything.

91
00:05:43,324 --> 00:05:46,394
So we, we follow the SOC
standards and security control

92
00:05:46,394 --> 00:05:48,124
and for the audit logging.

93
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:51,469
And the performance optimization here.

94
00:05:51,549 --> 00:05:55,394
specialized cryptographic process,
ac accurate, accurate, crypto

95
00:05:55,894 --> 00:05:59,744
accurate encryption, decryption
encryption, decryption operations

96
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:04,184
while freeing the databases, services,
resources, maintain throughput.

97
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:10,069
even during the initiative security
operations, I. And with that, like

98
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:14,869
we, we, the performance of the
databases have been improved a lot

99
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:17,059
after implementing this encryption.

100
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:21,079
So the connections, the sessions which
are coming to the databases has been

101
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:25,829
decreased, due to un unwanted reports,
unwanted reports, pulling that, pulling

102
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:29,459
and connecting to the databases without
doing anything, they're just connecting

103
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:30,989
the databases and running something.

104
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,899
So we, we disconnected all
those connections with the

105
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:35,069
help of this encryption.

106
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:36,709
With the help of encryption.

107
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:41,279
If we go on to the next slide, we have
a few more topics like how we, how the

108
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:46,769
technical implementation, how we prepare,
configuration, encrypt, validate, maintain

109
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:53,469
the here, the preparation, the database
around will come, the preparation that all

110
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:55,349
the databases are not on the past level.

111
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:59,574
So initially we applied patches
to, latest elevated patches

112
00:06:59,574 --> 00:07:01,314
to, for the security standard.

113
00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:03,984
We have applied all the
patches for all the databases.

114
00:07:04,344 --> 00:07:08,054
and we implemented those are also
like, we, what we did for initially,

115
00:07:08,054 --> 00:07:09,584
we took one or two databases.

116
00:07:09,614 --> 00:07:12,584
We implemented manually for the
first, and then we started doing

117
00:07:12,644 --> 00:07:14,804
all the scripting process here.

118
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:21,454
the configuration, we did, we engineered
robust HMS, Oracle td. TTDE integration

119
00:07:21,454 --> 00:07:26,534
channel with multi-layer authentication
protocols, encryption, deployed

120
00:07:27,524 --> 00:07:32,714
strategic encryption, access table
spaces and sensitive data columns,

121
00:07:32,774 --> 00:07:34,934
and minimal performance impact.

122
00:07:34,994 --> 00:07:39,994
Validate, executed regular,
executed rigorous encryption.

123
00:07:40,534 --> 00:07:45,964
Ation testing with third party security
experts to verify the protection.

124
00:07:46,414 --> 00:07:47,194
Third party expert.

125
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:51,509
we have some expert to test that,
encryption process, like how they're

126
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:56,459
able to access the data, the maintenance
established automated key rotation.

127
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:02,269
Ation schedules and comprehensive
audit ready main management protocols.

128
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:04,639
The rotation of the
keys are very important.

129
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,819
We need to update the passwords,
update the current password,

130
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:09,999
current password every 90 days.

131
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:14,025
So we automated those, password
rotations, so it was very helpful

132
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:16,425
for us to do the process and.

133
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:21,855
And here are the five phases which we
implemented with most of, we went from

134
00:08:21,855 --> 00:08:26,835
some minimal downtime to zero downtime
to implement this process here, we got,

135
00:08:27,105 --> 00:08:30,795
we have to bonds, bond the database
multiple times, but this minimal

136
00:08:30,795 --> 00:08:34,725
downtime, what we did for, we have most
of the databases are like databases.

137
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:37,425
So we did it in a no way.

138
00:08:37,425 --> 00:08:38,055
Single node.

139
00:08:38,055 --> 00:08:38,625
Single node.

140
00:08:38,674 --> 00:08:41,764
All the users, application
users can access the data even

141
00:08:41,764 --> 00:08:45,245
though we are implementing
this, this encryption process.

142
00:08:45,745 --> 00:08:51,685
And here are the TDE transparent
data encryption integration

143
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:53,160
challenges, which we faced.

144
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,040
Legacy capability.

145
00:08:55,219 --> 00:09:00,199
The multiple database, instances require
critical version upgrades, patch app patch

146
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:04,479
applications before h HSM integration
would be implemented successfully.

147
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:07,270
So most of the databases
are different version.

148
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:14,095
In Oracle, we have 11, 11 I to 19 C, so we
have upgraded all the databases to latest

149
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,995
version 19 C. And also we are thinking
about to implement the newer version

150
00:09:17,995 --> 00:09:21,590
of 23 a IE. we are working on that.

151
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,800
In future I'll be talking
about those things also.

152
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,760
So network configuration network,
establishing the security

153
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,390
encryption communication channel
between the Oracle databases and

154
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,300
HSM encryption, HSM application.

155
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:39,660
demands complex r routing rules and
certificate based authentication and

156
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,830
performance tuning Intel encryption
process triggered the significant io

157
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:48,940
io latency across a high transaction
system, necessary the customer buffer

158
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:54,050
and configuring in the table space
optimization and, TDE encryption and,

159
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,720
And the key management engineering
robust fault tolerance process for the

160
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:05,030
master key backup, restore, and disaster
recovery Required multi mul, meticulous

161
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,400
plans and multi-layered safeguards.

162
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,810
we are taking backups of the databases
every day, so if there is any need,

163
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,260
like the restoration points, we
are creating restoration point.

164
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,790
like every 15 minutes we are
creating restoration points.

165
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,810
Depends upon the customer interest
and also we are taking the archive

166
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:27,220
of backups so they can pinpoint
restore, they can do it anyway.

167
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,580
With the help of this, with the
help of this HSM encryption, we did

168
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,480
it a lot of changes automated, so
it'll be very helpful to restore

169
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,505
the databases where we want to go,
like for the testing databases.

170
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:39,855
They want to restore, like
after they are, they were,

171
00:10:39,915 --> 00:10:41,085
they're testing multiple things.

172
00:10:41,085 --> 00:10:44,005
They want to restore 10 minutes
before we can do easily, and

173
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,895
there is no issue with the keys.

174
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:50,535
And we really like, that HMH
some encryption help us a lot.

175
00:10:50,535 --> 00:10:53,920
while we are doing the restoration
promotion process, it'll help

176
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,180
us to restore the database
very easily and fast and with.

177
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,694
Encryption with that encryption there.

178
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:04,389
There is no loss of data while
we are doing this, like testing

179
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:05,859
process for the testing databases.

180
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:08,380
And automate, automation.

181
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,560
The, we did a lot of automation during
this key, key process, like here,

182
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:19,360
custom scripts here, we use, we, we
use Python and ba dash scripting here.

183
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:24,575
What we did like initially, we did it
manual, manually, this encryption process.

184
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:29,165
Initially we need to install some
software like a Luna client for my client.

185
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:32,045
client usually use, they use
Luna client to store the keys.

186
00:11:32,315 --> 00:11:36,245
So from the a Luna client, they need to
install the loan client from the server.

187
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:39,145
To the HSM encryption
valid cybersecurity team.

188
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:43,205
They use this luna kind to,
to talk from, Luna client.

189
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,165
it's a heartbeat.

190
00:11:44,475 --> 00:11:47,685
it usually, the encryption
key issues isnt this heartbeat

191
00:11:47,685 --> 00:11:49,535
from database to encryption it.

192
00:11:49,535 --> 00:11:51,305
It is like it is signal.

193
00:11:51,705 --> 00:11:51,707
it is.

194
00:11:51,707 --> 00:11:52,305
It is a heartbeat.

195
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:54,690
it's like a, it's a human heartbeat.

196
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,900
similar to the HSM encryption.

197
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,060
It's a heartbeat and connection
between the database and the, database.

198
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,340
And the Valids.

199
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:08,040
So if Luna can help us to read the
data and Store, protect the data.

200
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,890
So we did it.

201
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,945
Everything is like automated,
like after the new, after

202
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:14,565
the Luna client installation.

203
00:12:14,595 --> 00:12:18,400
We, we need to, we need, we, during
the manual process, we need to

204
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,760
get the security team, HSM Team,
CyberArk team, network team.

205
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,000
And me the database.

206
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,640
So we all need to work together to,
to, for the step-by-step process.

207
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,960
We streamline the process with
the help of self scripting.

208
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,940
So what we did with the one one execution
of the script while monitoring, we are in

209
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,280
front of the comer while monitoring it'll.

210
00:12:39,465 --> 00:12:43,905
It'll throughput, whatever the person
need to enter the passwords and, give

211
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:48,625
access to the, access to the particular
application team or, the CyberArk team.

212
00:12:48,655 --> 00:12:51,345
It'll prompt the CyberArk password there.

213
00:12:51,455 --> 00:12:56,645
if it's password like HSM encryption
password, like keyword password, where

214
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:58,415
it'll come and request for the teams.

215
00:12:58,465 --> 00:13:01,580
They need to just come and
enter the password with the.

216
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,640
Cryptographic algorithm, password,
all they need to do one click saying

217
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,680
that I'm granting the password.

218
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,690
So only that guy can control.

219
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,930
They need to log in from their
machine and they need to just

220
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,700
give that like just one click.

221
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,440
So we automated everything.

222
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,460
We no need to be like sitting in front
of the computer with everyone available

223
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,330
and the three, three to four hours
process, we streamline the process.

224
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,430
So the monitoring system.

225
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:31,080
Here, the realtime monitoring
system, while the database is up and

226
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:35,620
running like we are, we did it like
encryption process where there's

227
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,449
no impact for the application user.

228
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:42,029
While we are imp while we are
implementing this process, I. So we

229
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:47,159
streamline the process validation tools
after we implementation violation,

230
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:52,079
the developer comprehensive testing
framework that automatically verify

231
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,519
encryption integration, security
complaints, implementing potential human

232
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:59,609
over sites, documentation, regulatory.

233
00:13:59,609 --> 00:14:00,885
We documented everything.

234
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:05,905
Built intelligent document system
that automatically product, Produce

235
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:11,775
audit Ready Co auditory complaints
report tailored to each databases safe

236
00:14:11,805 --> 00:14:14,429
encryption parameters, and configurations.

237
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:18,859
Yeah, here are the key managed
key management workflow.

238
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:23,439
What we did and had this workflow,
it is if we go over through these

239
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:30,309
generation distribution, usage,
rotation backups, generating generation

240
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:34,919
means HSM generation, Cryptographic
key keys, which we are, we, when

241
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:38,559
we do step by step process, it'll
generate the keys in the ballot.

242
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:42,849
We need to store those creed, tamper,
restaurant hardware using NISD

243
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:49,209
certified, entropy source and true random
number generation, the distribution.

244
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:50,249
Encryption.

245
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:55,769
We securely put, propagated to Oracle
wallets through auto automated channels

246
00:14:55,819 --> 00:15:00,374
while rolled database access control
and multifactor authentication.

247
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:06,989
The usage, the TD is also similar, CT,
D and HS encryption, both the same.

248
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:11,819
The TDE leverages the key keys of
seamless encryption, decryption

249
00:15:11,849 --> 00:15:15,799
opt, operational while maintaining
the optimal data performing and

250
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:18,649
data leverages rotation automated.

251
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:22,750
we have automated this key rotation,
automated periodically rotation,

252
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,260
information hygienic and my.

253
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,560
Mitigates the risk of the long
term keys case and protection

254
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,130
compromise and the backups.

255
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,430
here are the backups.

256
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,930
we do take the backups like we automated
the key backups, which we physically

257
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:44,200
store, the store, those keys, we are
printing those keys in the valid room.

258
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:48,710
we have, like in, for my client, we,
so they have some secure, valid room.

259
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,690
They usually store those keys.

260
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,920
Keys like it.

261
00:15:52,775 --> 00:15:57,615
Like a bank wallet, bank vault,
they usually store those phy, store

262
00:15:57,615 --> 00:15:59,955
those keys physically every quarter.

263
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:01,935
Every quarter they store those keys.

264
00:16:01,935 --> 00:16:07,065
They update the keys in the room so
no one can able to access those keys.

265
00:16:07,335 --> 00:16:12,095
We, and comprehen, the backups,
which we are used like comprehensive

266
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:16,125
keys, escrow system with,
Geographically displays, encrypt

267
00:16:16,215 --> 00:16:21,395
offline backups, business continuity
in the disaster recovery process.

268
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:22,315
Yeah.

269
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,595
Here are the performance impact.

270
00:16:24,865 --> 00:16:29,845
Here are the performance impact, which
we, After implementing the, yeah, after

271
00:16:29,845 --> 00:16:34,475
implementing the HSM encryption, we do
see a lot of implementing the database

272
00:16:34,475 --> 00:16:36,905
performances, like the Select operations.

273
00:16:37,145 --> 00:16:38,135
Select operations.

274
00:16:38,185 --> 00:16:43,795
we do get almost like the 50%, like
20% increase in the efficiency and the.

275
00:16:44,445 --> 00:16:48,465
like the response time and output of
the select queries has been increased

276
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:53,925
with the help of H-M-S-H-H-S-M
based encryption, like writing,

277
00:16:54,115 --> 00:16:56,605
writing operation, insert update.

278
00:16:56,855 --> 00:17:00,785
we have seen almost 40%
implement for these inset and

279
00:17:00,815 --> 00:17:02,405
update operations and that.

280
00:17:02,905 --> 00:17:06,445
All the data we just entering
the table spaces are like,

281
00:17:06,535 --> 00:17:09,115
everything is encrypted a ES 2 56.

282
00:17:09,215 --> 00:17:12,430
we have altered the, all the
databases with the, all the table

283
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:17,260
spaces with, a ES 2 56 encryption
after we implemented the databases.

284
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,960
So all the ta, all the table spaces
are like encrypted, so the insect

285
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,430
operations will run very fast.

286
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:28,540
Because minimal number of connections
are coming, so it'll accept the all.

287
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,410
Insert update.

288
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:33,850
Insert update, select queries like
the streamline, the select queries,

289
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,500
and we streamline the process.

290
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,730
there's no.

291
00:17:37,645 --> 00:17:40,505
like buffer gates and the
ram speed has been increased.

292
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:42,645
the performance of the ram and everything.

293
00:17:42,675 --> 00:17:46,465
The server level has been increased after
implementing this, h some encryption.

294
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:50,665
The delete operation has been
increased up to 30%, which we, which

295
00:17:50,665 --> 00:17:52,905
were really re really while resort.

296
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:57,185
Full table scan while the performance,
if we see the execution plan before

297
00:17:57,185 --> 00:17:59,014
and after these HMS encryption.

298
00:17:59,064 --> 00:18:02,775
The execution plan of the queries
has been imp increased, the

299
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:04,575
performance has been increased a lot.

300
00:18:04,695 --> 00:18:08,160
like I times buffer gates, and,
before we usually see a lot

301
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,520
of the s sequels are in like.

302
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,610
Sequences are running around.

303
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,220
for example, if it is running for
th 300, 3, 300, 300 buffer gates,

304
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,409
it is going down to 200 and few.

305
00:18:18,409 --> 00:18:22,939
I and CP is going like the po
the performance of that CCPU

306
00:18:22,939 --> 00:18:25,999
and I has been increased by 30%.

307
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,950
here, comprehensive performance testing
involve minimal overhead from HSMN

308
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:36,800
based TD implementation, operation
experience, and average latency.

309
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,520
Increase to 25 to 40% with
select queries, list effect, and.

310
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,550
Least affected and update.

311
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,699
Update operation shows the highest impact.

312
00:18:44,699 --> 00:18:47,459
So the deployments has
been completed so far.

313
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:51,149
So application can do the testing
very fast after the completion of

314
00:18:51,149 --> 00:18:56,459
their updates and delete operation
despite, despite the downtime has been

315
00:18:56,459 --> 00:18:58,319
ridiculous for the weekend maintenance.

316
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,679
So they can like, The performance,
the performance varies.

317
00:19:03,189 --> 00:19:04,974
the availability of the
database, availability of the

318
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:06,564
application has been increased.

319
00:19:06,924 --> 00:19:10,664
So encryption is more important
for all the databases?

320
00:19:11,164 --> 00:19:11,495
Yeah.

321
00:19:12,245 --> 00:19:13,714
Compliance and benefits.

322
00:19:13,924 --> 00:19:19,024
So if I already talked about these
things, the, regulatory standards and.

323
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:22,225
Corporate security audit implements.

324
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:28,655
See, the PCI, the P-P-P-P-C-I is about
these, the SE to secure cardholder

325
00:19:28,655 --> 00:19:31,385
data with strong cryptography.

326
00:19:32,074 --> 00:19:36,695
G-D-P-R-G-D-P-R is general
data protection Regulation.

327
00:19:37,504 --> 00:19:41,675
Implement the state of the art,
the data protection measure.

328
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:42,570
HIA.

329
00:19:43,489 --> 00:19:44,840
HI Security rules.

330
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:47,814
This is PHI, the personal
health insurance.

331
00:19:48,474 --> 00:19:52,304
Confidential confidentiality
through encryption.

332
00:19:52,574 --> 00:19:58,454
SOX control the maintain in integrity
of the financial report system.

333
00:19:58,954 --> 00:20:05,014
Report security mitigating the data,
breach financials and regulations impact

334
00:20:05,494 --> 00:20:08,524
establish robust inter intellectual.

335
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:11,119
Property protection layer.

336
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:17,584
Build latency client to client trust
through demonstrate the security gain

337
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:22,054
security advantage through security
excellence, the audit improvements,

338
00:20:22,204 --> 00:20:27,414
the streamlined over oversight with
centralized the key management.

339
00:20:27,914 --> 00:20:32,024
Enable regular security events
monitoring analysis, accelerate

340
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:36,915
the complaints, verified with
clear audit, trail, demonstrate the

341
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:39,194
security governance and stakeholders.

342
00:20:39,694 --> 00:20:44,464
Here we, and if we go into the
cross team co collaboration, right?

343
00:20:44,704 --> 00:20:48,094
We have collaborated with the
database team and the database

344
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:51,964
team and I have collaborated with
security team, application team,

345
00:20:52,024 --> 00:20:54,784
infrastructure team and compliance team.

346
00:20:55,024 --> 00:21:00,364
So we lead the TD arch architecture
design, implementing security database

347
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:02,059
level configuration changes and.

348
00:21:03,004 --> 00:21:06,604
Conducted extensive
performance optimization to

349
00:21:06,604 --> 00:21:08,164
minimal encryption overhead.

350
00:21:08,614 --> 00:21:12,334
The security team established a
robust encryption standards developer,

351
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:17,904
comprehensive key management policies,
and perform regulars penetrate the testing

352
00:21:17,934 --> 00:21:19,779
to validate the security implementation.

353
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,544
The, if we go to the application team.

354
00:21:23,044 --> 00:21:26,734
Executed through complete
compatibility testing across all

355
00:21:26,734 --> 00:21:30,334
environments, application, identify
and resolve the encryption.

356
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:36,864
Regulated keys and implemented necessary
code modification to security integration.

357
00:21:36,864 --> 00:21:38,724
So here are the most important thing.

358
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:40,914
We stored all of the data, right?

359
00:21:41,214 --> 00:21:45,484
Most of the data is, we are upgrading
from old version to latest version.

360
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:48,954
So application team, we work with
application team to up upgrade

361
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:52,854
their application also to access
the current version of the

362
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:54,504
data, which we are implementing.

363
00:21:55,004 --> 00:21:59,224
HSM hardware procurement and
deployment configure the secure

364
00:21:59,224 --> 00:22:03,334
network architecture and establish a
high availability infrastructure to

365
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:06,994
ensure uninterrupted HMS services.

366
00:22:07,234 --> 00:22:10,704
So infrastructure team, they had,
they work in the middle saying

367
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,209
that we collaborated everything.

368
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:16,724
They helped us to build this HMS
encryption, streamline process with

369
00:22:16,724 --> 00:22:18,724
the less downtime compliance team.

370
00:22:19,224 --> 00:22:20,874
Mely documented.

371
00:22:21,204 --> 00:22:26,454
They help us to, like we, we are, we give
all the steps to documented the process.

372
00:22:26,484 --> 00:22:30,464
Implementation, again is re regulatory.

373
00:22:30,584 --> 00:22:36,134
The framework, the provides complaints,
guidance, throughput throughout the

374
00:22:36,404 --> 00:22:42,524
project lifecycle and prepared detailed,
elevated packages of upcoming audits.

375
00:22:43,024 --> 00:22:47,705
If we go to the matrix, the implementation
of these, we, I've implemented around

376
00:22:47,705 --> 00:22:52,734
more than 50 plus databases and,
comprehensive encryption deployed across

377
00:22:52,824 --> 00:22:58,514
all the production development and testing
environment and up time and up time.

378
00:22:58,514 --> 00:23:02,614
Maintain encrypted operation
continues sim seamlessly with.

379
00:23:03,394 --> 00:23:08,374
With, negligible service integration
during these implementation.

380
00:23:08,374 --> 00:23:12,909
So we, the most important thing we
worked on it is very less downtime,

381
00:23:12,969 --> 00:23:17,649
which we achieved with these streamlining
automation of these processes.

382
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:23,004
And we safeguarded almost three
terabyte for each database is slow.

383
00:23:23,024 --> 00:23:25,419
If we combine everything light like.

384
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:32,324
almost 150 to 200 terabyte databases,
which we, data, which we, which we

385
00:23:32,324 --> 00:23:37,654
secured with this, implementation
of HSM and the 30% audit time.

386
00:23:37,654 --> 00:23:39,154
Reduce the streamline.

387
00:23:39,154 --> 00:23:43,024
These campaigns will verification
through automate the key management

388
00:23:43,024 --> 00:23:44,494
and secured audit trials.

389
00:23:44,494 --> 00:23:48,904
So we, with this implementation,
we disconnect the most of the

390
00:23:48,904 --> 00:23:51,524
unwanted, unused, Read only Econs.

391
00:23:51,524 --> 00:23:54,644
We eliminated all those
econs with this encryption.

392
00:23:54,644 --> 00:24:00,174
So the audit team, we have
radio audit team validation.

393
00:24:00,174 --> 00:24:03,189
So they were very hap happy
about this implementation.

394
00:24:03,689 --> 00:24:05,909
Key takeaways and next
steps, which we are.

395
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:10,439
Elevating for these security
standards enhances security.

396
00:24:10,439 --> 00:24:14,219
Deploy multi-grade HSM
encryption across 50 databases.

397
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:18,919
Established a robust shield of
mission critical customer data assets.

398
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,020
Scalable approach.

399
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:26,030
Leverage customer automation frameworks
to streamline encryption deployment,

400
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:33,560
reducing implementation time by
60% with assuring security control.

401
00:24:34,235 --> 00:24:41,375
Complaints achievement sub process
through regulatory required in including

402
00:24:41,435 --> 00:24:49,445
PCI and GDPR with maintain sub query
performance on critical system,

403
00:24:49,835 --> 00:24:55,614
the future expansion in initiating
the phase encryption with and.

404
00:24:56,114 --> 00:25:02,684
Quarterly cryptographic three rotation
with nine with zero downtime architecture.

405
00:25:03,184 --> 00:25:07,804
And thank you so much for giving
me this opportunity to talk on my

406
00:25:08,134 --> 00:25:12,244
hardware security module, which I
recently implemented for my client.

407
00:25:12,784 --> 00:25:17,354
And I'm very happy to present
myself as a senior Oracle database

408
00:25:17,414 --> 00:25:19,094
administrator from LGM Entry.

409
00:25:19,544 --> 00:25:21,044
Thank you for giving me this chance.
