1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:02,280
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,510
I'm Balraj Kraj, QA architect
and IT specialist expert.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,590
Today I'd like to explore how
codeless automation and AI

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,200
prompts empower manual testers.

5
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:18,160
I'm gonna take like around like 20
minutes and I will get discussing about

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,865
the challenges, the automation barriers,
and a new how to democratize automation.

7
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:30,205
The frameworks that we follow to
implement those automation, codeless

8
00:00:30,205 --> 00:00:32,674
automation and the benefits.

9
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:36,605
And we will also discuss about
the common concerns and the

10
00:00:36,605 --> 00:00:38,855
takeaways at the end before we see.

11
00:00:39,634 --> 00:00:39,935
Okay.

12
00:00:39,965 --> 00:00:44,429
Let's get started from manual
testing to prompt mastery.

13
00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:46,745
How this can be achievable.

14
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:47,885
Yes, this is achievable.

15
00:00:47,944 --> 00:00:52,114
This is very beneficiary, I would
say, but the first challenging facing

16
00:00:52,144 --> 00:00:55,054
we need discuss about the challenges
for the manual testers today.

17
00:00:55,655 --> 00:01:01,474
There is a widening gap job posting, now
demand automation and E screens, creating

18
00:01:01,474 --> 00:01:04,714
a shop divided QEA, manual testers.

19
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:09,934
The reach in product knowledge and
domain expertise face growing pressure

20
00:01:10,085 --> 00:01:12,065
as roles evolve faster than ever.

21
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:18,890
Script based tools like Selenium and Cirus
remain out of reach for many non coders.

22
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,000
Widening gaps in pay
progression and job security.

23
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,330
The rising stakes, yes.

24
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,290
EA driven development and
rapid CACD cycles have raised

25
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,179
the bar for quality assurance.

26
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:37,820
Teams are more expert to deliver faster
feedback, broader coverage, and continuous

27
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,740
integration of test into every bill.

28
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:40,655
The risk.

29
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,490
Cease and detest us with invaluable
insight into user journeys or

30
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:50,780
being sidelined by technical
automation rules, even though their

31
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,970
intuition remains irreplaceable.

32
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:04,760
The traditional automation barriers,
coding prerequisites, automation

33
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,935
rules, demand coding skills
like Java, Python, Java, screen.

34
00:02:09,935 --> 00:02:14,225
That many experienced manual testers
lack with this technical barrier

35
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:19,085
creates an artificial debate between
technical and non-technical testers and

36
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:21,725
understanding the complex frameworks.

37
00:02:22,205 --> 00:02:26,705
Now, the complex frameworks shift focus
from what to test to how to code the test.

38
00:02:27,305 --> 00:02:32,165
This distracting from core quality
insight and another burden is

39
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:37,536
maintenance script based automation
requests constant updates for all UHA.

40
00:02:38,255 --> 00:02:42,065
Creating significant technical debt
that worries team in maintenance

41
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:43,745
work rather than innovation.

42
00:02:45,935 --> 00:02:48,935
A new parum democratizing
the test automation.

43
00:02:49,505 --> 00:02:53,765
The convergence of codeless automation
platforms and prompt engineering

44
00:02:53,765 --> 00:02:59,255
techniques offers a transformation
solution by combining intuitive to

45
00:02:59,915 --> 00:03:02,430
interfaces with well craft DA props.

46
00:03:03,335 --> 00:03:07,955
Organizations can empower manual
testers to translate their domain

47
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:12,335
expertise into executable test
without writing a single line of code.

48
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:15,065
We show simplicity.

49
00:03:15,515 --> 00:03:19,925
Codeless platform use drag and wrap
interfaces that mirror testers,

50
00:03:19,985 --> 00:03:24,940
mental models, making automation
accessible and entity from day one.

51
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,340
And next one is ary.

52
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,970
That unlocks sophisticated
test generation, still feeling

53
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,080
locators, intelligent assertions
through natural language commands.

54
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,060
If you are able to handle these two,
we can able to preserve the domain

55
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,990
expertises test is leverage their
replaceable product knowledge while

56
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:50,000
seamlessly adopting modern automation
practices on contributing immediately

57
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,840
four PACE transformation framework.

58
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,900
Platform evolution, knowledge transfer,
standardization, the process, and scaling

59
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,320
the process In Platform evolution.

60
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,340
Initially, we need to access codeless
tools based off organization needs,

61
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:11,210
tech stacks compatibility, and
a prompting comp capabilities.

62
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,410
Look for the platforms that
truly democratize the automation.

63
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:22,340
This is very important to take it
off and once we have a curated.

64
00:04:22,955 --> 00:04:27,395
Platforms that were set Then
knowledge transfer train manual

65
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:31,445
testers on visual automation and
the problem engineering techniques.

66
00:04:31,895 --> 00:04:35,735
Avoiding technical complexity
while building confidence

67
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:37,685
through hands-on practices.

68
00:04:38,105 --> 00:04:44,045
That way testers will be ready to work
on the day one standardization process.

69
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:46,715
Establish the reusable prompt libraries.

70
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,509
Test templates and the best
practices for consistency.

71
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,889
Create a foundation for scalable
maintainable automation,

72
00:04:56,719 --> 00:04:59,269
then scaling up the process.

73
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:06,409
Integrate the automated test into CACD
pipelines, expand coverage systematically

74
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:10,519
and measure impact on release
velocity and defect detection rates.

75
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:16,295
Little detail about Pace One
evaluating the codeless platforms.

76
00:05:16,325 --> 00:05:20,195
There are critical selection criteria
that we need to take care of that we rest.

77
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:23,695
All of four three pieces
will be in the smooth place.

78
00:05:25,165 --> 00:05:27,565
First thing is a native futures.

79
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:31,495
The tools that should support prompt
engineering capabilities and intelligent

80
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:35,100
test generation, visual workflow design.

81
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,205
The tool that should intuitive
builders that mirror testing.

82
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,380
Thought processes.

83
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,420
Then seamless integration
connects to Jira, CACD tools.

84
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,020
Test management tools now is all the
tools support this, so I think we should

85
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,510
be good in this self feeling capabilities
adopts automatically to UA changes

86
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,015
dramatically reducing maintenance product.

87
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,270
That's upcoming even for the code.

88
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,140
We were expecting the self fielding
capabilities to reduce the maintenance.

89
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,040
Then why not?

90
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:11,300
It is with codeless automation,
collaboration tools, version control

91
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,850
team, libraries, and shared resource.

92
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,400
These things we should tools that
support all these activities.

93
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,050
We need to avoid platforms
that merely hide code behind

94
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:27,090
abstractions or record extensive
scripting for advanced scenarios.

95
00:06:27,765 --> 00:06:32,265
Codeless solution should enable
productivity in days, not months.

96
00:06:34,215 --> 00:06:37,905
Some of the example I like to explain
about the pace one that we discussed

97
00:06:37,905 --> 00:06:40,755
about a financial service QA team used.

98
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:46,665
Testing autonomous mode to auto generate
one 20 login and a dashboard test

99
00:06:46,725 --> 00:06:49,095
from plain English prompts in a week.

100
00:06:49,845 --> 00:06:54,675
The key takeaways, A driven test
creation saves manuscripting time.

101
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,170
And uncovers missed edge
cases nearly yearly.

102
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,090
Second example, the visual workflows that
I'm talking I was talking about earlier.

103
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,850
A telecom tester adopted test are
recorded to build a regression

104
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,220
flows by clicking through the ua.

105
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,290
No export editing needed.

106
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:19,860
Key takeaway visual builders mirror a
test mental model, allowing manual testers

107
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,470
to contribute automation immediately.

108
00:07:24,495 --> 00:07:27,050
Phase two, knowledge
transfer and upskilling.

109
00:07:27,855 --> 00:07:29,835
Reframe the automation concepts.

110
00:07:29,895 --> 00:07:35,265
Introduce usual workflows as a natural
extension of manual test cases rather

111
00:07:35,265 --> 00:07:38,145
than fundamentally different disciplines.

112
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:43,365
Map a familiar testing technology
to automation constructs.

113
00:07:44,835 --> 00:07:46,815
Introduce prompt engineering basics.

114
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:52,755
Teach testers to write effective
prompts that generate accurate locators.

115
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:55,035
Assertions test logic.

116
00:07:55,455 --> 00:07:58,844
Start with simple examples
before progressing to complex

117
00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:02,055
scenarios here, leaving, right?

118
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:05,905
That makes us to feel better
on contributing each thing.

119
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:09,025
Hands-on practice provide a sandbox.

120
00:08:09,025 --> 00:08:14,095
Environments where test can environment
safely without fear of breaking

121
00:08:14,095 --> 00:08:18,380
production systems, encourage
iterative refinement and peer learning.

122
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,990
Now all the software system have
their own dedicated test environment.

123
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,030
That is the best place to practice
whatever they like, because beyond that,

124
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:31,690
there are stage UAT performance platforms.

125
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,680
Everything is different.

126
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,564
So nowadays, all application
have a standard standard test

127
00:08:37,564 --> 00:08:38,974
environments to practice with.

128
00:08:39,874 --> 00:08:41,194
Celebrate the year livings.

129
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:45,274
Recognize initial automation,
success, publicity to build momentum.

130
00:08:45,994 --> 00:08:50,764
Showcase how quickly manual testers can
contribute meaningful automated coverage.

131
00:08:51,104 --> 00:08:53,714
That makes feel better
even for other testers.

132
00:08:54,014 --> 00:08:54,404
Okay.

133
00:08:54,404 --> 00:08:57,614
That's something they feel, that's
something that is doable and they're

134
00:08:57,614 --> 00:08:58,664
able to move forward with it.

135
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:03,194
It's a special mention about
the prompt engineering that is

136
00:09:03,194 --> 00:09:05,234
a, the bridge to automation.

137
00:09:05,714 --> 00:09:09,884
Prompt engineering bridges the gap
to AI powered automation letting

138
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:14,354
use testers use natural language
to articulate testing intent.

139
00:09:14,894 --> 00:09:18,254
The skill they have already
hone from years of writing

140
00:09:18,254 --> 00:09:20,054
test cases and bug reports.

141
00:09:20,714 --> 00:09:22,544
For example, natural language test.

142
00:09:23,384 --> 00:09:27,494
Navigate to checkout, verify
total matches, card complete

143
00:09:27,494 --> 00:09:29,354
payment, valid card details.

144
00:09:29,414 --> 00:09:32,954
It's a pure natural language,
but it's a prompt for the com.

145
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:36,094
One trigger or one command intel.

146
00:09:36,094 --> 00:09:38,944
How to locate the locate
with the natural language.

147
00:09:39,304 --> 00:09:39,904
Simple.

148
00:09:39,964 --> 00:09:40,834
In a simple word.

149
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,174
Find the summit button in the login form.

150
00:09:43,204 --> 00:09:47,734
Even if it is ID or class
name changes between releases.

151
00:09:48,424 --> 00:09:50,614
That way it automatically detects.

152
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:54,379
Submit button, even if it
is an ID form or class form.

153
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:59,479
This will take care of it and how to
implement the assertions in the command.

154
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:04,099
Confirm error message appears
when email format is inval

155
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:06,229
and includes helpful guidance.

156
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:10,579
This is a simple language that gives
act as a command for the assess.

157
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:18,019
Navigation effective prompts reduce
complexity dramatically allowing testers

158
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:22,789
to focus on what needs testing rather
than wrestling with how to coding.

159
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:29,329
This leverages existing domain expertise
instead of requiring entirely new

160
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:34,159
technical skills because new technical
skill paper lack on the domain knowledge,

161
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:38,059
so that's sometimes it is risky.

162
00:10:39,784 --> 00:10:44,134
Some of the examples I like to describe
about it reframing automation concepts.

163
00:10:44,704 --> 00:10:49,624
A government QA team converted 50
manual UI flows into visual workflows

164
00:10:49,624 --> 00:10:52,174
using test and chat GT prompts.

165
00:10:52,804 --> 00:10:56,944
Instead of saying, click here,
validate there, tested, started

166
00:10:57,184 --> 00:11:00,064
saying, verify user registration.

167
00:11:00,064 --> 00:11:03,184
Email triggers after
successful form submission.

168
00:11:03,814 --> 00:11:07,834
This is the natural
language Act as a command.

169
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:10,789
These plain language tips.

170
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:14,959
Autogenerated, codeless, automation
scripts, the key benefits

171
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:18,799
testers finally saw automation
as historically, not the coding.

172
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:23,119
Take prompt writing one example on it.

173
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:27,109
During a two week workshop, test
practice transforming acceptance

174
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:31,819
criteria into yay prompts, such
as log in with valid credentials.

175
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:35,119
Check the dashboard
loads within two seconds.

176
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:37,289
This is the command test.

177
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:39,259
That will evolve it.

178
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:44,239
Tools like BLE and testing
converted those into maintainable.

179
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:48,259
Automated test key benefits
builds confidence that

180
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:49,969
language is equal to logic.

181
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,739
Nothing to think more about it.

182
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:58,249
Once test realized their own words can
power automation, confidence skyrockets,

183
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:00,289
and your transformation takes off

184
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:04,219
Phase two, phase three.

185
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:05,269
That is very important.

186
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:08,984
Standardizing and storing
all the best practices first.

187
00:12:08,984 --> 00:12:12,734
Initially, prompt libraries curate
the proven prompts for common

188
00:12:12,734 --> 00:12:14,774
testing patterns like login flows.

189
00:12:15,644 --> 00:12:20,714
Form validation, data verification,
enabling quick reuse and

190
00:12:20,714 --> 00:12:22,424
adoption across projects.

191
00:12:22,994 --> 00:12:26,534
And also standardize the
templates like test templates.

192
00:12:26,924 --> 00:12:30,704
Develop standardized frameworks for
different tissue types like regression

193
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:34,934
smoke integration, ensuring consistency
while maintaining flexibility.

194
00:12:36,644 --> 00:12:37,664
Quality guidelines.

195
00:12:37,994 --> 00:12:42,854
Establish clear criteria for maintainable
automation, naming conventions,

196
00:12:42,884 --> 00:12:47,234
documentation standards, and review
process that prevent technical data

197
00:12:48,194 --> 00:12:53,174
standardization, accelerates onboarding
for new team members, improves cross

198
00:12:53,174 --> 00:12:57,524
team collaboration, and protects
institutional knowledge from being lost

199
00:12:57,524 --> 00:13:00,404
to turnover or organizational changes

200
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,964
where co-host turns into
clarity in the space.

201
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:05,354
Three.

202
00:13:06,164 --> 00:13:07,244
Prompt libraries.

203
00:13:07,604 --> 00:13:10,574
A state level curating created
a centralized to prompt

204
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:13,124
library inside Confluence.

205
00:13:13,694 --> 00:13:18,464
It included reusable prompts
for our login payment and a data

206
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:22,874
validation across 12 microservices
when any prompt was improved.

207
00:13:22,934 --> 00:13:28,784
All related issues all to updated
via are linked references, key

208
00:13:28,784 --> 00:13:33,374
benefits, every tester contributes
once and every benefits.

209
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:35,969
Everyone benefits, right?

210
00:13:35,969 --> 00:13:38,339
Ones test everywhere That is possible.

211
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,339
Tested templates.

212
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:44,969
Some of the example teams
in different business units.

213
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:49,649
Build the standard templates for
regression smoke and EAP test where

214
00:13:49,739 --> 00:13:55,769
tester could drone a base, a PH, check,
health check template, customize a few

215
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:58,409
prompts and be up and running in minutes.

216
00:13:58,979 --> 00:14:00,539
Key benefits, maintenance.

217
00:14:00,944 --> 00:14:05,054
Consistent coverage and structure across
products while saving, setup time,

218
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,804
pace for scaling and
the ca CD integration.

219
00:14:12,524 --> 00:14:13,034
Pretty much.

220
00:14:13,034 --> 00:14:13,364
Yeah.

221
00:14:13,784 --> 00:14:15,824
Scaling of the process is important.

222
00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:16,974
Part of the all the.

223
00:14:18,714 --> 00:14:24,534
All the four pieces like CACD
integration, embed codeless automation

224
00:14:24,534 --> 00:14:29,154
into continuous integration pipelines,
configure automated test, execution

225
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:34,014
on code, commits full request and
scheduled intervals for continuous

226
00:14:34,014 --> 00:14:36,234
quality feedback, progressive coverage.

227
00:14:37,464 --> 00:14:38,154
Expansion.

228
00:14:38,484 --> 00:14:42,714
Start with critical user journeys,
then systematically expand to edge

229
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:45,354
cases and integration scenarios.

230
00:14:45,954 --> 00:14:50,574
Measure coverage growth alongside
defect reduction rates to demonstrate

231
00:14:50,574 --> 00:14:53,094
the value performance, monetary.

232
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:59,019
Track key metrics, test, execution,
time ness rates, maintenance

233
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:00,909
effort and time to feedback.

234
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:05,439
Use data-driven insights to refine
the approaches and demonstrate

235
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:07,749
clear ROI to stakeholders.

236
00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:10,889
Some of the example of it.

237
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:16,279
In CACD integration in one of the
insurance modernization project,

238
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:20,179
automated pursuits were triggered
directly from GitHub actions

239
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:22,549
and assured DevOps pipeline.

240
00:15:22,909 --> 00:15:27,379
After every code commit within three
sprints, 80 percentage of the regressions

241
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:30,379
checks ran automatically before ing.

242
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:35,839
Key benefits QA become continuous dev
defects are caught in hours, not in

243
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,929
days for progress coverage expansion.

244
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,699
The QA team began with FI
critical business flow, like

245
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:46,099
registration, payments, and reports.

246
00:15:46,099 --> 00:15:46,969
Over time.

247
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:50,809
They used prompt based test
generation to expand coverage

248
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:53,629
to 45 plus edges scenarios.

249
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:57,229
Using dashboards, they dragged
automation coverage growth

250
00:15:57,319 --> 00:15:59,659
alongside defect reduction threats.

251
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:05,779
Key benefits builds measurable momentum,
expanding impact without overloading tips.

252
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:10,039
The transformation
becomes self-sustaining.

253
00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:12,889
We stop treating QA as a project base.

254
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:15,529
It becomes part of the organization's DNA.

255
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:20,929
Every release, every commit, every
prompt adds intelligence to the system.

256
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:28,549
Key takeaways, empowering manual
testers, transforms manual testers into

257
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:34,879
automation enablers by executing them with
codeless platforms and AI driven tools.

258
00:16:35,224 --> 00:16:38,074
Leveraging their invaluable
domain expertise.

259
00:16:39,184 --> 00:16:43,894
Structured transformation, a four
piece framework, guides, organizations

260
00:16:43,894 --> 00:16:49,054
through platform evolution, skill
development, standardization, and scaling.

261
00:16:49,084 --> 00:16:51,034
Faster enable automation success.

262
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:56,494
A prompt for prompt engineering,
prompt engineer access the critical

263
00:16:56,494 --> 00:17:01,894
bridge, allowing testers to use natural
language to define complex test logic

264
00:17:02,164 --> 00:17:03,994
and accelerate automation adoption.

265
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:07,189
Enhanced to quality and efficiency.

266
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:12,559
This approach delivers faster release
cycles, higher software quality, and

267
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,564
employees, QA teams, ensuring they remain
central to the development process,

268
00:17:25,249 --> 00:17:28,309
transforming QA into a
human centered discipline.

269
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:30,979
Human plus EA equal to smart quality.

270
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:34,219
This framework doesn't
replace human testers.

271
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:39,589
It imps them by blending codeless
automation with AI driven prompts,

272
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,689
testers amplify their impact without
losing the creative and critical

273
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,639
thinking that define real quality.

274
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:51,889
The future of QA isn't just
faster, it's more human, more

275
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:53,809
insightful and more collaborative.

276
00:17:56,179 --> 00:17:58,339
Measurable benefits of the transformation.

277
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:02,330
These improvements translate
directly to accelerate release

278
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:06,620
cycles reduced to production
defects, and announced team morale.

279
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:10,429
Quality becomes shared responsibility
rather than the bottleneck.

280
00:18:11,629 --> 00:18:17,659
Faster test creation codeless approaches
grammatically reduce time from

281
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:20,629
test design to execution coverage.

282
00:18:20,629 --> 00:18:24,649
Increase the com democratized
automation enables broader test

283
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:27,409
coverage across futures and platforms.

284
00:18:28,234 --> 00:18:32,044
Maintenance reduction,
self-healing test, and yay.

285
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,124
Driver updates.

286
00:18:33,424 --> 00:18:37,384
Minimize ongoing overhead
tester engagement.

287
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:40,384
Manual testers report
higher job certification.

288
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:46,024
When with automation skills,
safeguarding institutional knowledge.

289
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:49,984
This is the key thing that we
were introducing this framework.

290
00:18:50,494 --> 00:18:53,944
One of the greatest risk in
traditional automation transformations

291
00:18:54,004 --> 00:18:55,924
is the loss of domain expertise.

292
00:18:56,674 --> 00:19:01,534
When manual testers are sidelined
organizations, four feet years of

293
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:06,664
accumulative product knowledge, user
behavior, insights, and H case awareness.

294
00:19:07,504 --> 00:19:09,394
So we capture the expertise.

295
00:19:09,455 --> 00:19:13,955
Testers encode domain knowledge into
reusable prompts and visual workflows,

296
00:19:14,344 --> 00:19:16,445
and share widely codeless platforms.

297
00:19:16,445 --> 00:19:21,334
Make automation assets transparent
and accessible to entire teams.

298
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:26,870
Evolve, test, refine, and expand
automation based on production

299
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,790
insights and emerging scenarios.

300
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:33,260
This virtuous cycle transform
institutional knowledge from tribal

301
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:37,939
wisdom into living documentation,
re silent to team turnover and

302
00:19:37,939 --> 00:19:39,889
scalable across the organization.

303
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:45,800
Some of the common concerns that
I'm like to address pretty much

304
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,024
everywhere in the social media, but
I like to give the answer for that.

305
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:51,274
A replace test entirely.

306
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:51,814
No.

307
00:19:52,205 --> 00:19:56,344
A arguments human judgment, but cannot
replicate the critical thinking,

308
00:19:56,644 --> 00:20:00,364
empathy, and contextual understanding
that experienced test is bring.

309
00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:03,784
Codeless automation
makes test more valuable.

310
00:20:03,905 --> 00:20:08,524
Not observ or codeless tools are
robust enough for complex scenarios.

311
00:20:09,064 --> 00:20:14,435
Modern platforms handle sophisticated
workflows including EP testing, database

312
00:20:14,705 --> 00:20:17,764
validation, and conditional logic prompt.

313
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:22,219
Prompt engineering unlocks advanced
capabilities without coding requirements.

314
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:23,929
What about vendor locking?

315
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:28,189
Choose platforms with export
capabilities and open integrations.

316
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:33,559
Prioritize tool that announced rather
than replace existing process, allowing

317
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:35,629
gradual adoption and flexibility.

318
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:42,499
Key takeaways, democratize
automation with Codeless platform

319
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:44,959
and follow the four PACE framework.

320
00:20:45,485 --> 00:20:49,024
Leverage the prompt engineering
as a bridge skill, then amplify

321
00:20:49,024 --> 00:20:50,465
the institutional knowledge.

322
00:20:52,114 --> 00:20:56,364
Thank you everyone for listening
this, I hope this was very helpful

323
00:20:56,574 --> 00:21:00,715
for all the organizations that who
are undergoing all the EA upgrades.

324
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:01,914
Thank you.
