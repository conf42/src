1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,250
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,890
Thank you so much for this opportunity.

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:06,629
My name is Kate Kumar Patel.

4
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:09,840
I am a senior business
application architect at Wind

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,979
River wind River Systems.

6
00:00:12,459 --> 00:00:18,420
I have 13 Salesforce certification,
which includes system and

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,130
application architect certification.

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,000
I know everything about
Salesforce from inside to outside.

9
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:30,410
So nowadays after the AI introduction
in this world, now I'm spending a

10
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:36,260
lot of my time just thinking about
how we can use AI more responsibly.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,400
Today I want to talk about
something really exciting building

12
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:47,590
ethical AI with rust, a framework
for trust and performance.

13
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,470
Now AI is everywhere.

14
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:56,110
It writes our emails, it helps
sales team to close more deals.

15
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,710
It even suggests what
shoes we might want to buy.

16
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,350
Sometimes it's too aggressive, right?

17
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,825
In Salesforce, we see
it in Einstein, GPT it.

18
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:12,610
It is writing like personalized email
in forecasting tools, and even in

19
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,890
chat bots handling customer service.

20
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,230
But here is the catch.

21
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,870
AI is like a superhero.

22
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,390
Which is, it is very fast.

23
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,450
It is very powerful.

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,850
It saves us a lot of time.

25
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,650
But if you think about it, like
when I was in my 10th standard I

26
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,810
saw a movie that is like Spiderman.

27
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,120
I think everybody knows about that movie.

28
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:44,080
And in that movie uncle Ben told
Spider-Man with the great power

29
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,420
comes with the great responsibility.

30
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,940
That's the same thing
we have to apply in ai.

31
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,850
Like AI is super powerful,
but that powerful things come

32
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,740
with the great responsibility.

33
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,440
Ethical AI in rust refers, so
that's the ethical AI in Rust.

34
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:11,220
And Ethical AI in Rust refers to the
practice of developing and deploying

35
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,890
artificial intelligence systems.

36
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,980
With the focus on aligning with
the moral PR principles and so

37
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:25,610
society values and in ensuring it,
it has like fairness, transparency.

38
00:02:26,195 --> 00:02:30,575
Accountability and it also
respects for human values.

39
00:02:31,175 --> 00:02:33,905
So what happens if we don't have this?

40
00:02:33,935 --> 00:02:40,995
What happens if we just use the AI
without any without any ethical values?

41
00:02:41,205 --> 00:02:47,205
So if we don't guide AI with the ethic,
ethics, it can invade our privacy.

42
00:02:47,554 --> 00:02:52,649
It can treat people very unfairly, or
it can even make mistakes at scale.

43
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:55,699
So that's where the rust comes in.

44
00:02:55,939 --> 00:03:00,979
It gives us that safety net to
make AI not just the powerful,

45
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:03,379
but also the trustworthy.

46
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:07,479
So why ethical AI Rust matters?

47
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:09,279
So think about this.

48
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,309
AI in Salesforce is making like
life easier for sales rep. It makes

49
00:03:15,309 --> 00:03:17,140
life easier for service agents.

50
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,290
It predicts who's likely to buy or
help answer customer's question.

51
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:29,010
But if privacy is ignored, suddenly
your shoe search follows you across

52
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,830
every website like obsessed stalker.

53
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:37,170
So if fairness isn't checked and AI
might give a better service to one group,

54
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,950
but worse service to another group if.

55
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,840
Fairness is not checked, then AI
might give a better service to one

56
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,149
group and worse service to another.

57
00:03:48,649 --> 00:03:55,219
And if reliability fails, then
imagine Einstein GPT sending the

58
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:57,790
wrong email to the wrong person.

59
00:03:58,509 --> 00:04:01,809
Rust is like the seatbelt for ai.

60
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:08,109
It has memory safety, it has
ownership, it has strong type system.

61
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:12,689
Those sounds like a boring
developer features, but in reality

62
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,210
they mean less data leaks, fewer
bugs and stronger guardrails.

63
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:25,530
So whether you are working with Salesforce
Einstein or building a custom CRM engine,

64
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:29,730
rust helps make sure AI doesn't just work.

65
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,100
It works responsibly.

66
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,760
And let's not forget the rule maker.

67
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,660
We have GDPR in Europe.

68
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,310
We have CCPA in California,
and now we have EU AI Act.

69
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:50,990
These law says you must ask clearly to
customer before collecting their data.

70
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,430
You must give people the right to say no.

71
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,630
You must prove your AI isn't
doing any sketchy things by 2024.

72
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:08,390
More than 70% of AI system in CRM
already started complying with

73
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,490
already started comply with it.

74
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:16,730
That means if you are running Salesforce
Service Cloud in healthcare, you

75
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:21,920
can't just hope patients are okay
with sharing their data with others,

76
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,840
but you must have to prove them.

77
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,570
Rust helps because we can enforce
these rules right in the code.

78
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:34,855
Think of it like baking a privacy
into the cake, not just sprinkling

79
00:05:34,915 --> 00:05:37,405
it on top of the LA top of the cake.

80
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:39,675
Later on, let's talk privacy.

81
00:05:40,155 --> 00:05:46,665
Rust naturally protects data with its
own ownership model and a memory safety.

82
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:52,515
It's like having a digital bouncer
who makes sure that data doesn't

83
00:05:52,515 --> 00:05:54,280
sneak out to the wrong place.

84
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,830
Now add some cool privacy
trick, differential privacy.

85
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:05,390
Imagine Salesforce dashboard showing
sales trend, but with the customer's names

86
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,390
scrambled, so no one's identify leaks.

87
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,810
Home homomorphic encryption.

88
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,980
Sounds funny, right?

89
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,050
It's like a being able to calculate
your credit card bill without

90
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,670
even looking at the numbers.

91
00:06:20,495 --> 00:06:22,865
Secure multi-party computation.

92
00:06:23,405 --> 00:06:28,595
Two companies compare customer
overlap without actually

93
00:06:28,595 --> 00:06:30,425
revealing their customer list.

94
00:06:31,055 --> 00:06:32,315
Federated learning.

95
00:06:32,945 --> 00:06:40,625
Instead of moving all the raw data to
one big bucket, the AI learns one each.

96
00:06:41,405 --> 00:06:45,990
One local salesforce org and
just share the learning, like a

97
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,590
student doing homework separately.

98
00:06:48,365 --> 00:06:50,435
But comparing the answers later.

99
00:06:51,095 --> 00:06:55,325
So instead of a creepy movement
like this, like why my insurance

100
00:06:55,325 --> 00:06:56,855
data is sold everywhere.

101
00:06:57,485 --> 00:07:00,935
Movements like this, you don't
see when you build trust.

102
00:07:01,435 --> 00:07:03,895
Now let's look at the bias.

103
00:07:03,895 --> 00:07:05,905
So bias is third trickiest.

104
00:07:06,085 --> 00:07:06,955
We learn of ai.

105
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,295
AI is not like a human.

106
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,795
It doesn't think like us.

107
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,760
It cannot think like us.

108
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,430
It doesn't have a actual
brain that we have.

109
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:21,940
So what it does is it just copies the
pattern from the past, and if past

110
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:27,880
was unfair, the AI becomes unfair to,
for example, a Salesforce lead scoring

111
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:34,930
model might keep favoring customer from
New York to San Francisco just because

112
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,650
historically that's where deal closed.

113
00:07:39,265 --> 00:07:41,695
Sorry, small towns, you are out of luck.

114
00:07:42,235 --> 00:07:47,875
Or an AI chatbot may answer faster
in English than the Spanish, not

115
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:52,105
because it's smarter, but because
that training data was lopsided.

116
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:59,415
Rust helps by letting us build bias
detection metrics and forcing fairness

117
00:07:59,415 --> 00:08:02,145
rules and continuously monitor results.

118
00:08:02,595 --> 00:08:04,995
Think of it like running a spell checker.

119
00:08:05,495 --> 00:08:09,204
Instead of catching typos,
it catches unfit treatments.

120
00:08:09,684 --> 00:08:15,294
That's why Einstein forecasting or
Einstein GPT treats all customer equally,

121
00:08:15,804 --> 00:08:18,654
not just the one with the most data.

122
00:08:19,154 --> 00:08:22,564
Now, let's be honest,
nobody trust us Black box.

123
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:25,424
Imagine Salesforce AI tells you.

124
00:08:26,024 --> 00:08:30,764
The customer will churn in two weeks,
and then you would ask, how do you know?

125
00:08:31,604 --> 00:08:34,394
So Rust gives us the speed
to air explainability

126
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:36,424
without slowing things down.

127
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,584
So local explanation.

128
00:08:39,154 --> 00:08:43,054
Why did this lead get a score of 92?

129
00:08:43,114 --> 00:08:47,314
That's your, so when we have a question
like, why did this lead get a score of 92?

130
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,694
So then AI look, then the AI look at that.

131
00:08:51,694 --> 00:08:56,764
Oh, because they, because this
customer open like five emails and

132
00:08:56,854 --> 00:08:59,444
it the customer has scheduled a demo.

133
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:03,254
So that is why the lead score is 92.

134
00:09:03,754 --> 00:09:05,224
Global explanation.

135
00:09:05,374 --> 00:09:05,974
Why.

136
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:08,959
Generally driving sales.

137
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:10,759
What's generally driving sales?

138
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:16,989
Maybe it's the webinar attendance more
than the website clicks counterfactual.

139
00:09:17,109 --> 00:09:20,709
What if this customer had
one more support ticket?

140
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:21,909
Would that change?

141
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:22,779
Churn prediction?

142
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:30,879
So this is like giving a chair GPT, not
just a voice, but also ability to explain

143
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,789
itself, and that's how you build trust.

144
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:37,919
Governance structure
in Rust who watches ai.

145
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:39,509
That's governance.

146
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:46,259
Think Avenger style framework
design phase ethic rules are closed.

147
00:09:46,349 --> 00:09:49,319
Coded into the blueprint
development phase.

148
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:51,629
Audit trails can't be erased.

149
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:57,629
Like a Salesforce field history tracking,
but on steroid deployment phase.

150
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,949
Real time monitoring that
doesn't slow down the apps.

151
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:07,619
Operational operations phase,
continuous testing because AI should

152
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:12,989
never be set it continuous testing
because AI should not, should never

153
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:15,479
be like, set it and forget its system.

154
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:20,729
Government means there is always
someone holding the AI accountable.

155
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:23,879
Let's look at the one real story.

156
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:29,899
A big multinational needed a CRM
recommendation engine that was

157
00:10:29,989 --> 00:10:32,749
fair, private, and transparent.

158
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:40,789
We built it with, we built it in rust with
federated learning to keep customer data,

159
00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:47,784
local differential privacy to anonymous
sensitive information, fairness rule to

160
00:10:47,854 --> 00:10:51,794
stop to, to stop bias in recommendation.

161
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,229
Explain NA ability.

162
00:10:54,229 --> 00:10:58,129
So every suggestion come with a reason.

163
00:10:58,729 --> 00:11:00,829
So what's the result out this out of this?

164
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:09,260
So a hundred percent GDPR and CCPA
compliance 93, 3% less demographic bias

165
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:14,390
and 27% higher customer trust scores.

166
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,709
And zero privacy leaks for 18 months.

167
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,834
So imagine.

168
00:11:20,675 --> 00:11:25,504
Salesforce Einstein recommendation
work like this, it wouldn't

169
00:11:25,504 --> 00:11:27,665
just suggest the right product.

170
00:11:28,264 --> 00:11:33,365
It would also explain why and
customers would actually trust it.

171
00:11:33,865 --> 00:11:36,564
So how do we put this into the action?

172
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:42,385
So architectural pattern, like
Salesforce flow, but for AI

173
00:11:42,505 --> 00:11:44,490
pipelines that like Salesforce flows.

174
00:11:45,295 --> 00:11:53,665
For AI pipeline data training, data
inference, all separated development

175
00:11:53,665 --> 00:11:59,935
practices, thrust links and fairness
test baked into your DevOps pipeline,

176
00:12:00,475 --> 00:12:06,115
operational safeguard dashboard
and alerts in Salesforce to catch

177
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:08,665
when the AI drifts off track.

178
00:12:09,505 --> 00:12:15,745
The good news, we have open source
reusable com components so you don't

179
00:12:15,745 --> 00:12:18,235
have to reinvent the wheel every time.

180
00:12:18,735 --> 00:12:21,795
Let's wrap up with three simple points.

181
00:12:22,635 --> 00:12:28,515
Rust Safety feature makes it the
perfect foundation for ethical ai.

182
00:12:29,505 --> 00:12:34,305
It takes privacy, fairness,
transparency, and governance.

183
00:12:34,785 --> 00:12:40,605
Must be built in from Salesforce
must be built in from the Salesforce.

184
00:12:41,145 --> 00:12:50,045
Ethical AI isn't just the right thing to
do it right thing to do, but trust drive.

185
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,415
But trust drives adoption and success.

186
00:12:52,915 --> 00:12:53,755
Think about it.

187
00:12:54,205 --> 00:12:58,645
Would you rather use AI
that is fast and sketchy or.

188
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:03,820
Or one that's powerful and
trustworthy, and most customer will

189
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,330
always say powerful and trustworthy.

190
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,500
Thank you so much for your time today.

191
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,370
Remember before you leave, just
remember ai, just AI is like a

192
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:21,360
superhero, but in every movie I have
seen a superhero needed a sidekick.

193
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,640
So this ai, big boy, the AI
boy also need a sidekick.

194
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:31,200
And for the ai boy that's
a sidekick is ethics.

195
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:38,220
And with the rust as a foundation and
Salesforce as a platform, we can build

196
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:46,320
AI that is not just smart, but also
fair, transparent, and trustworthy.

197
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,950
Thank you so much for
listening to me today.
