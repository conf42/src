00:10:01,749 --> 00:10:05,139
Reducing search time by 60
percent compared to traditional

137
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:06,969
graph based searches.

138
00:10:07,469 --> 00:10:08,549
Pattern recognition.

139
00:10:09,469 --> 00:10:14,189
AI embeddings detect recurring
architectural patterns, identify

140
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:19,059
redundant code, and even suggest
refactoring opportunities by analyzing

141
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:23,039
semantic similarities across multiple
repositories and code versions.

142
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,089

158
00:11:41,024 --> 00:11:42,854
tailored to the project at hand.

159
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:44,164
Adaptability.

160
00:11:44,165 --> 00:11:48,984
RAC dynamically learns from
a team's architecture, naming

161
00:11:48,984 --> 00:11:50,894
conventions, and design patterns.

162
00:11:51,634 --> 00:11:58,844
This ensures that AI driven generated
code aligns with organizational standards

163
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:02,074
and requires fewer manual revisions.

164
00:12:02,574 --> 00:12:03,904
