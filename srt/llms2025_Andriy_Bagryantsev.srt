00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:07,830
Hello everyone and welcome to Con
42 Large Language Models 2025.

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,840
I am Andre bso.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:18,270
I serve as both CFO and CLO, and my
background includes engineering, web

4
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,270
development, and of course finance.

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,760
Today I am excited to be here
and I'm excited to talk about

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,400
how large language models are.

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:36,570
Changing the way we do
finances for our companies.

8
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:37,400
Okay.

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,099
Let's start with a small introduction.

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:47,330
I have been working at the intersection of
finance and legal operations for a while,

11
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:55,010
and I've seen firsthand how emerging AI
technologies are transforming the way.

12
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:02,770
Companies manage data, optimize
cash flow, and ensure compliance.

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,810
And this presentation will explore how
LLMs are not only automating routine

14
00:01:10,815 --> 00:01:19,785
processes, but also how they can unlock
new strategic possibilities like.

15
00:01:20,505 --> 00:01:26,185
Freeing up capital and,
empowering businesses to make

16
00:01:27,025 --> 00:01:29,785
faster and smarter decisions.

17
00:01:30,285 --> 00:01:36,225
So let's dive in by looking at
what the financial landscape

18
00:01:36,495 --> 00:01:39,375
looked like before LLMs.

19
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:46,024
To understand the impact
of LLMs, it helps.

20
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,399
To look back at how we did things
in finance not too long ago.

21
00:01:52,899 --> 00:02:01,030
We lived in a world that revolved
around spreadsheets and reports.

22
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:08,070
Our data usually sat in silos,
whether in separate departments

23
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,290
or across outdated databases that.

24
00:02:13,905 --> 00:02:15,915
Didn't play nicely with each other.

25
00:02:16,415 --> 00:02:21,215
This made it nearly impossible
to get a real time snapshot

26
00:02:21,785 --> 00:02:24,035
of, our financial health.

27
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:31,045
So we would wait for our month
and or quarter end close.

28
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:38,725
We would see what happened, and only
then we could decide how to respond.

29
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:43,695
It wasn't just the reporting
cycles that slowed us down.

30
00:02:44,145 --> 00:02:49,935
We also faced a challenge in dealing
with unstructured information,

31
00:02:50,435 --> 00:02:56,735
regulatory documents, contracts,
emails, invoices, and even social media.

32
00:02:56,735 --> 00:03:03,790
Comments about our company often
stayed outta reach for analytics.

33
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:10,610
Because traditional finance and
finance tools just, just were

34
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,300
not built to handle natural text.

35
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,110
That was the environment I
worked in for many years.

36
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:28,040
When data was stale, by the time we got
it, human bias was always in the mix.

37
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:35,120
And compliance frameworks were
so rigid that we always worried

38
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,910
that we might miss something.

39
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:44,230
Then came the rapid development
of large language models and what

40
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:49,600
sets large language models apart
is their ability to process.

41
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:58,060
And interpret massive amounts of text,
everything from invoices to emails,

42
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,870
and even complex legal documents.

43
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:09,730
More importantly, LLMs can do this
in a way that captures the context

44
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,220
and the nuance of human language.

45
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,710
Instead of handling only structured
data like numbers and columns, LLMs

46
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:29,330
can, can let us leverage the huge
amount of text-based data that was

47
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:36,820
previously off limits or too time
consuming to pars for finance.

48
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,800
That's a remarkable shift.

49
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:45,235
Now we can look beyond a single
spreadsheet or a single dashboard.

50
00:04:45,895 --> 00:04:52,255
We can gather insights from the
natural language we produce every day.

51
00:04:53,125 --> 00:05:00,205
When you feed enough relevant data to your
LLM plus the right instructions about how

52
00:05:00,205 --> 00:05:03,985
your business operates, you get nearly.

53
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:11,440
Real time guidance on potential risks
or bottlenecks or opportunities.

54
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,140
And, you also get a system
that keeps learning constantly.

55
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:23,750
This is not just about generating
reports faster, it's about noticing

56
00:05:24,045 --> 00:05:30,375
patterns and issues that their
human eye could easily miss.

57
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:36,125
Which can lead to more
proactive finance operations.

58
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:37,285
Okay.

59
00:05:37,615 --> 00:05:44,420
One of the first areas where
I saw LLM Shine was in fraud

60
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:50,890
detect detection, running online
platforms that process millions.

61
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,280
Our transactions a day.

62
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,490
I have seen many fraud attempts.

63
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:06,040
These fraud attempts ranged from, from
the usage of stolen credit cards to

64
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,920
really elaborate identity theft schemes.

65
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:14,025
And, later we used to rely
on rule-based systems.

66
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:22,945
Those systems were basically sets of if
then conditions and, the systems could

67
00:06:22,945 --> 00:06:26,395
flag transactions that seemed suspicious.

68
00:06:26,895 --> 00:06:32,435
if they fall under any of those
conditions, for example, it can

69
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:35,225
be unusual purchase amounts.

70
00:06:35,615 --> 00:06:41,585
Foreign IP address or a mismatch
in location, et cetera, et cetera.

71
00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:48,615
Such systems were easy for bad
guys to outsmart because fraudsters

72
00:06:48,645 --> 00:06:54,045
adapt quickly, and our rules had to
be manually updated all the times.

73
00:06:54,545 --> 00:07:03,395
LLMs by contracts, by contrast, can digest
both structured and unstructured data.

74
00:07:03,895 --> 00:07:10,465
This means they can analyze user
interactions, user transactions,

75
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:17,485
user behavior, everything, even the
text of messages a user generates.

76
00:07:18,035 --> 00:07:25,505
this can be analyzed to find subtle
warning sites, signs of fraud.

77
00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:29,335
LLMs don't just rely on a single rule.

78
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:36,985
They can spot differences in writing
style or detect discrepancies in

79
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:42,555
someone's transactional history,
all of which might suggest fraud.

80
00:07:43,485 --> 00:07:46,515
Or some other system abuse.

81
00:07:47,015 --> 00:07:53,184
What I love most is how these models
learn from each new data block.

82
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:58,719
they take, constantly refining
what suspicious looks like.

83
00:07:59,544 --> 00:08:05,964
Since we started using an LLM based
system to detect fraud, we've seen a

84
00:08:05,964 --> 00:08:13,674
significant drop in fraud in fraudulent
transactions while also cutting down on

85
00:08:13,674 --> 00:08:17,214
false alarms for legitimate customers.

86
00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:21,594
That was a win on both fronts.

87
00:08:22,094 --> 00:08:26,924
Another transformation
involves cashflow management.

88
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:33,155
If you are into finance and if you've
ever tried to figure out exactly where

89
00:08:33,155 --> 00:08:40,534
your money is at any given moment of
time, or if you try to predict where your

90
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:46,895
money will be in a few weeks, you know
how critical the cashflow management is.

91
00:08:47,824 --> 00:08:56,284
In many businesses, we used to rely on
monthly or quarterly forecasting, which

92
00:08:56,284 --> 00:09:03,314
meant we didn't always react quickly
if something, if something went wrong.

93
00:09:03,884 --> 00:09:08,634
For instance, we couldn't react
quickly if, key suppliers started

94
00:09:09,594 --> 00:09:15,744
shipping late or if our sales
suddenly spiked beyond expectations.

95
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:23,229
But with an LLM driven approach, we
can integrate data from our resource

96
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:30,849
planning system, from supplier
websites, from the markets, and even,

97
00:09:31,349 --> 00:09:38,569
from the world news that might affect
our money flows because the LLM

98
00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:42,319
understands language and it can parse.

99
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:50,940
Any emails about delayed shipment, LLM
can see, the changes in contracts or

100
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:57,630
agreements, and this information then can
be fed into the bigger financial picture.

101
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,855
It's like having a continuous
conversation with your cash flow.

102
00:10:02,355 --> 00:10:07,185
It updates you the moment something
changes instead of weeks later.

103
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:13,545
For my companies, this has allowed us
to keep just the right amount of cash on

104
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:22,055
hand and we could invest the rest of our
cash where it can, generate some returns

105
00:10:22,535 --> 00:10:25,805
or we could, for instance, support.

106
00:10:26,765 --> 00:10:30,725
New ventures with the rest of
the cash, which we don't need.

107
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:31,765
Okay.

108
00:10:32,315 --> 00:10:38,305
given that I also oversee legal
compliance in our company, I'm

109
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:42,655
especially enthusiastic about
using LLMs in this domain.

110
00:10:43,155 --> 00:10:50,145
because managing compliance is hard,
especially if you operate across borders

111
00:10:50,355 --> 00:10:52,995
with different laws and regulations.

112
00:10:53,495 --> 00:10:58,355
in other words, if you operate in
different jurisdictions, companies

113
00:10:58,355 --> 00:11:03,200
usually have entire teams devoted
to reading the latest updates.

114
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,430
Check in.

115
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:11,140
Checking if they apply to them and
then modifying policies or procedures.

116
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,780
This is expensive, time
consuming and prone to errors.

117
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:24,480
But now imagine an LLM that constantly
monitors official governmental websites

118
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,945
news, some re some regulatory bulletins.

119
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:36,360
And the moment your LLM sees something
relevant, like a change in data

120
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:43,470
privacy law or a new payment regulation
or something similar, your LLM can

121
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:51,050
match that against your existing
policies and highlight areas that

122
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,960
might need updating or adjustments.

123
00:11:54,470 --> 00:12:01,730
it can, your LLM can even draft a first
version of those changes, saving your

124
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,060
legal team hours and hours of manual work.

125
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,870
Of course, we still need human
oversight to confirm final decisions

126
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,260
and maintain accountability, but.

127
00:12:14,905 --> 00:12:21,715
The reduction in manual search and
repetitive tasks is significant, and

128
00:12:21,715 --> 00:12:29,815
that translates into cost savings and
the more secure compliance posture.

129
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:33,555
I don't want to paint you a picture.

130
00:12:34,055 --> 00:12:36,095
That's too bright.

131
00:12:36,815 --> 00:12:44,835
Integrating LLMs into financial
operations has its, share of hurdles.

132
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,165
One of the biggest is data preparation.

133
00:12:48,665 --> 00:12:53,905
If you are financial information is
scattered, unprepared, and distribute,

134
00:12:53,965 --> 00:12:59,755
distributed across different systems
or poorly document, poorly documented.

135
00:13:00,255 --> 00:13:06,615
You will need to clean it and
standardize it before any AI model

136
00:13:06,615 --> 00:13:09,735
can deliver any reliable results.

137
00:13:10,425 --> 00:13:18,185
In my experience, this foundational work
can take much longer than you would think,

138
00:13:18,425 --> 00:13:21,775
but anyway, it's absolutely necessary.

139
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:25,885
Another challenge is, model transparency.

140
00:13:26,385 --> 00:13:35,645
For example, company stakeholders may want
to know why the AI system is suggesting

141
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:43,595
a particular action or decision, and
we can just shrug and say, it's ai,

142
00:13:43,895 --> 00:13:45,995
it's smart, and we have to trust it.

143
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:53,455
No, but to solve this problem we've
incorporated explainability tools that

144
00:13:53,455 --> 00:14:02,335
show which data points and which patterns
infl influenced the final LLMs decision.

145
00:14:03,115 --> 00:14:07,905
It's not always perfect, but it
works and it's a good start Then.

146
00:14:08,405 --> 00:14:10,175
There is human factor.

147
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,015
Of course.

148
00:14:11,345 --> 00:14:19,955
We had to train our staff to work
with LLMs in a collaborative way.

149
00:14:20,915 --> 00:14:27,125
We have to make them learn how
to put questions so the, so

150
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:34,315
that the system understands them
well and training my own team.

151
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:41,410
It took some time, but once people saw the
benefits, they became really enthusiastic

152
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,020
and they accepted the new approach.

153
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,775
Putting these elements together,
you get a new model for

154
00:14:49,275 --> 00:14:51,315
running a finance department.

155
00:14:51,815 --> 00:14:55,265
routine processes are mostly automated.

156
00:14:56,225 --> 00:15:03,755
Data analysis is continuous rather
than sporadic, and staff members

157
00:15:03,965 --> 00:15:09,845
focus on higher value tasks like
strategic planning and collaboration

158
00:15:09,845 --> 00:15:12,035
with the other parts of the business.

159
00:15:12,535 --> 00:15:20,155
It feels less like we are just keeping the
books, it feels more like we're steering

160
00:15:20,155 --> 00:15:22,595
the organization towards its goals.

161
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:31,070
Being informed by real time
insights and guided by advanced ai.

162
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,820
I can't overstate how freeing
this can be for A CFO.

163
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:43,760
Instead of drowning in a sea of everyday
tasks and trailing behind the business,

164
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,290
you find yourself anticipating obstacles.

165
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:54,370
Allocating resources more
efficiently and spotting profitable

166
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,390
opportunities sooner than before.

167
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:04,480
And, this change from reactive to
proactive approach extends across the

168
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:12,880
entire finance team and elevates the
role of finance within the organization.

169
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:19,890
As LLMs and related technologies
continue to advance, I think

170
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:25,520
we'll see even more interesting
possibilities in the near future.

171
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:31,270
LLMs will likely to be able to
handle more than just natural text.

172
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:38,349
LLMs might interpret visual data,
audio streams, and other media all

173
00:16:38,349 --> 00:16:45,010
at once, giving us an even better
understanding on of what's happening

174
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,190
both inside and outside our companies.

175
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:55,020
LLMs might act as collaborative
agents that interact with

176
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,300
different departments in real time.

177
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:04,190
Offering budget adjustments or
compliance checks right on the fly.

178
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:10,730
We could also see more
autonomous finance features.

179
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:18,170
Autonomous finance means that for some
simple tasks, like approving a common type

180
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,980
of invoice or transferring funds between.

181
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:30,290
Internal accounts and AI could, act
entirely on its own without supervision,

182
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:37,150
but under well-defined rules and, human
intervention would come in only for

183
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,530
more complex or unusual situations.

184
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:45,600
While that might sound futuristic now.

185
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:52,470
Many large companies are already
testing the waters here and, the

186
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:56,430
benefits in terms of speed and
accuracy are really compelling.

187
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:01,100
all of this means that the
role of the CFO is changing.

188
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,370
It's changing in fundamental way.

189
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,000
We are no longer just the keeper.

190
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,280
Of the historical records.

191
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:14,710
Instead, we are the designers of
financial intelligence systems.

192
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:23,170
The overseers of complex data flows
and the architects of risk management

193
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:27,130
strategies that adapt in real time.

194
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:34,590
We have the chance to build our companies
more effectively, blending financial.

195
00:18:35,025 --> 00:18:40,895
Aspect with the technological
aspect, but that opportunity

196
00:18:40,895 --> 00:18:43,475
also brings responsibility.

197
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:45,185
As CFOs.

198
00:18:45,455 --> 00:18:51,575
We need to ensure that AI is used
ethically and transparently, that our

199
00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:57,095
data is secure and that our decisions
remain fair and human centered.

200
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:58,825
We can't just.

201
00:18:59,185 --> 00:19:06,565
Pass the book to an AI system if something
goes wrong, but it's up to us to put

202
00:19:06,595 --> 00:19:15,480
governance and all necessary structures in
place and maintain oversight at all times.

203
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,520
All right, in closing.

204
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:22,850
I believe that large language
models represent one of the most

205
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:27,970
significant shifts in financial
operations in the last few decades.

206
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,670
they turn unstructured data
into actionable insights.

207
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:39,260
They give us near real time
oversight of cash flow.

208
00:19:39,755 --> 00:19:45,515
They supercharge fraud detection
and prevention, as well as

209
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:48,275
reduce the burden of compliance.

210
00:19:48,775 --> 00:19:54,195
While there are hurdles like data
preparation, and sometimes model

211
00:19:54,255 --> 00:20:02,475
explainability and sometimes team
training, the payoff is fantastic

212
00:20:02,805 --> 00:20:05,265
and the insights are really useful.

213
00:20:05,765 --> 00:20:11,795
as someone who's had the privilege
of building the AI systems in my own

214
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:19,925
project, I can't imagine going back to
the old ways of separate spreadsheets

215
00:20:19,925 --> 00:20:23,495
and endless manual checks with lms.

216
00:20:23,945 --> 00:20:30,785
our finance department is more proactive,
more collaborative, and better informed.

217
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,040
And that opens the door to
new strategic possibilities.

218
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,020
Okay.

219
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:46,346
Thank you very much for spending this
time with me exploring how LMS can

220
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:49,090
revolutionize financial operations.

221
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:54,530
I look forward to hearing
your questions, experiences.

222
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:58,520
And perhaps even your skepticism.

223
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:05,330
After all, it's through open conversation
that will continue to define these

224
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:10,910
AI tools and, ensure that they
service responsibly and effectively.

225
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:19,040
I really appreciate your attention and I'm
excited about the journey ahead for all

226
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,450
of us in the finance world being assisted.

227
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:27,850
By LLMs, thank you very much.

228
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:28,800
Goodbye.
