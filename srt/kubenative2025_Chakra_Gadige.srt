1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:00,950
Good morning.

2
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:01,640
Good evening, everyone.

3
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,800
Thanks for joining this
Conative event today.

4
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:04,670
My name is Chara.

5
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,529
I'm a technical leader at Cisco.

6
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,160
Today I'll be talking about
architecting CM resilience.

7
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,990
How technical solution architects enables
scalable, secure, KUBER native system.

8
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:21,020
So let's start as enterprise continues
to evolve their CRM or customer

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,340
relationship management platforms,
the demand for resilient, scalable,

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,919
and secure s has never been greater.

11
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:33,875
So technical solution architects are,
we call it as TSA, simply play a pivotal

12
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,695
role in bridging strategy and execution.

13
00:00:37,595 --> 00:00:41,675
Over the course of the session, we
will explore how the leadership shapes

14
00:00:42,035 --> 00:00:44,875
modern CRM transformations as inda.

15
00:00:45,865 --> 00:00:47,245
Here is what we'll cover today.

16
00:00:47,605 --> 00:00:51,775
First we will, looking the
evolution of the SA role and

17
00:00:51,775 --> 00:00:52,975
why it becomes so critical.

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,820
Next, we'll explore the business impact
of Kubernetes native CRM architectures.

19
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,110
Then we'll dive into architectural
frameworks and principles

20
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,820
that drives resilience.

21
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,220
Finally, I'll share implementation
strategies, challenges that we face,

22
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,140
and the roadmap for the transformation.

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,130
Let's begin with the
evolving CRM landscape.

24
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,775
So the CRM landscape.

25
00:01:16,355 --> 00:01:19,745
The CRM market is undergoing
a master shift projected to

26
00:01:19,745 --> 00:01:22,595
reach over 106 billions by 2028.

27
00:01:23,465 --> 00:01:27,905
Most of the solutions are now cloud
native and the Kubernetes become

28
00:01:27,905 --> 00:01:29,675
the default authorization layer.

29
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:35,545
So our nations are moving away from
monolithic platform towards containerized

30
00:01:35,605 --> 00:01:40,555
environments, which demands strategy
architecture to ensure performance,

31
00:01:40,555 --> 00:01:41,580
resilience, and scalability.

32
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,530
So this is exactly where technical
solution architect steps in

33
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,050
the strategic command post
TSS acts as a strategy command

34
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,790
force for CRM modernization.

35
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,720
They serve as the business translators,
ensuring the technical design

36
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,280
aligns with organizational goals.

37
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,775
Most importantly, they are the
visionaries and designing a

38
00:02:01,895 --> 00:02:03,630
scalable Kubernetes native system.

39
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:05,639
They manage technical depth.

40
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,090
Ensuring today's solution don't
becomes tomorrow's bottleneck.

41
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:14,820
And most importantly, they are
transformation leaders guiding our

42
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,460
nation through complex adoption journeys.

43
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,980
Architecture principle.

44
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,330
Here are few major architecture
principles at architecture level.

45
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,090
Resilience comes from the
code design principles.

46
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,920
Microservices, architecture
ensure flexibility, declarative

47
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,870
configuration brings consistency.

48
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,570
And our state full service management
address, CRM, data Persistence, API first,

49
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:41,080
design and integration and zero trust.

50
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,630
Security model protects
the system end to end.

51
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:49,240
So these foundational elements are
what makes Bernet native CRM truly

52
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:54,180
enterprise ready system complexity,
how TSA reduces system complexity.

53
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,000
TSS are just not architects.

54
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,040
They are simplifiers to be shot.

55
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,170
They reduce the complexity by
identifying the source of technical

56
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,280
depth, designing the streamlined
architecture, using a modular

57
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,380
approach for scaling and establishing
observability for proactive management.

58
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,780
This is how CRM platform stay
high when a wide NE block.

59
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,260
So what are the benefits of doing that?

60
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,580
Once these principles are applied,
the business benefits are very clear.

61
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,420
Foster delivery cycles through
automation, improved reliability,

62
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,360
that's more important with
the self-healing capabilities.

63
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,870
Dynamic scalability to meet the
fluctuating demands are where an

64
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:41,140
error of asylum these benefits are why
Kubernetes is reshaping the CRM landscape.

65
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,570
Economic impact.

66
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,100
Let's talk about economic impact.

67
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,900
According to the Forester, Kubernetes,
CRM architectures can generate millions

68
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,030
in cost savings over three year horizon.

69
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:56,950
They also reduce downtime significantly
and boost development or developer

70
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,560
perpetuity and lower infrastructure cost.

71
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,200
So this is just not a technical upgrade.

72
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,870
It is a business value
accelerator for sure.

73
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,890
So let's talk about
leadership practice here.

74
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,900
So before TSA involvement, many
or nations face monolithic CRMs,

75
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,550
manual deployments, inconsistent
environments, and security gaps.

76
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,899
After TSA LED transformation, the
picture changes dramatically here.

77
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:27,330
So microservice based CRM on Kubernetes
and automated CSCD pipelines,

78
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:32,280
security embedded by design and full
observability, the shift illustrate the

79
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,620
transformative power of DSA leadership.

80
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,920
Okay, metrics for CRMs.

81
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,850
Architecture success is just about design.

82
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,370
It's about measuring the impact.

83
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:49,969
We focus on challenge, change, value rate,
and meantime to recovery, deployment,

84
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:52,819
frequency, and lead time for changes.

85
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:57,080
When these metrics improve, we know
the architecture is truly resilient.

86
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,809
Security considerations.

87
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,900
No CRM is complete
without robust security.

88
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,929
That means strong identity
and access management.

89
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,119
Secure secret management.

90
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:11,200
Enforcing the network policies
for microservice communication and

91
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:13,929
continuous container security scanning.

92
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:19,919
This measures ensure that resilient also
means security implementation roadmap.

93
00:05:20,249 --> 00:05:23,279
So the roadmap for
transformation has five stages.

94
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:24,449
Assessment.

95
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:27,749
Understand the current pain
points in your organization.

96
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,719
Design, create the Kubernetes native
blueprint, how you want to approach pilot,

97
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:38,309
prove out of core functionality, nothing
but you're making some kind of A POC.

98
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:42,289
Make sure you are achieving
what you really want to scale.

99
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:46,639
Deployment, migrate progressively
and continuous optimization.

100
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:48,889
Adapt to our business evaluation.

101
00:05:49,414 --> 00:05:53,875
This faced approach balances
speed with stability challenges.

102
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:57,865
I believe a better secure product
comes with a lot of challenges.

103
00:05:57,895 --> 00:06:03,085
So challenges exist everywhere
and here as well, like stateful,

104
00:06:03,085 --> 00:06:07,555
workload management and latency
integration, database performances

105
00:06:07,585 --> 00:06:09,115
and multi-tenant complexities.

106
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:13,164
But TSS mitigates these
with proven strategies.

107
00:06:13,885 --> 00:06:16,610
We'll use stateful sets or caching.

108
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,250
Service MIS adoption
and namespace isolation.

109
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,710
So what's the final result?

110
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,070
A practical pathway
through technical huddles.

111
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,059
Key takeaways to summarize my
session today here TSS are strategy

112
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:32,859
leaders, not just technical enablers.

113
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:34,749
Architectural framework matters.

114
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:38,469
They simplify complexity
and accelerate delivery.

115
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:42,900
And most importantly, Kubernetes
NA CRM unlocks real business value

116
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,554
through efficiency and resilience.

117
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:47,124
So what can you do after today's session?

118
00:06:47,664 --> 00:06:51,804
Next up that I suggest evaluate
your current CRM architecture.

119
00:06:52,284 --> 00:06:56,904
Consider Kubernetes expectation
for resilience, and invest in

120
00:06:56,904 --> 00:06:58,794
arbitrator ship to guide your journey.

121
00:06:59,604 --> 00:07:01,764
So finally, thank you.

122
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,384
Thank you all for joining the session.

123
00:07:03,414 --> 00:07:07,304
Once again, a big thank you to Con
42 for providing this opportunity.

124
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,155
I hope it has given insight.

125
00:07:10,545 --> 00:07:14,205
Into how TSA shape CRM
resilience in Kubernetes era.

126
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,835
I would be happy to answer any questions
or discuss any specific scenarios

127
00:07:17,835 --> 00:07:19,335
relevant to your organizations.

128
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:20,034
Thank you all.
