00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,050
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,310
Welcome to the stock on large scale
data engineering in space exploration.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,930
Now, when we think of space, we
often imagine rockets, astronauts,

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,160
or far away planets, but behind
every mission is a mountain of data

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,400
and someone needs to collect it,
process it, and make sense of it.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,470
That's where the data engineer comes in.

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,220
We are like the pit crew for the space
science, so let's dive into how we

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,650
manage this cosmic flood of information.

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,420
First, let's talk on the data revolution
in the space exploration, space.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,060
Missions today are generating
more than, ever before.

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,000
We are talking about hundreds
of terabytes every single day.

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,180
to put this into perspective, imagine
watching Netflix 50 year straight.

13
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,600
That's the kind of data some
missions produce, and with smarter

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,930
systems, we are processing this
faster and more efficiently.

15
00:00:48,505 --> 00:00:53,185
which is compared to older systems, we
are processing this 47% better than that.

16
00:00:53,695 --> 00:00:55,465
we are also squeezing data like magic.

17
00:00:55,775 --> 00:01:00,155
advanced compression techniques reduce
the size of these huge files more than

18
00:01:00,155 --> 00:01:02,585
10 times, which is like zipping it.

19
00:01:02,765 --> 00:01:07,115
10 gigs file down to one gigs
before sending it across space.

20
00:01:07,615 --> 00:01:10,915
Now let's talk about the
data infrastructure behind

21
00:01:10,915 --> 00:01:11,845
these missions, right?

22
00:01:12,325 --> 00:01:16,435
So when a spacecraft launches, it's
like flying a smart device packed

23
00:01:16,435 --> 00:01:20,455
with sensors, each one, collecting
every single specific information.

24
00:01:20,485 --> 00:01:25,405
Imagine your car telling you the tire
pressure, oil level, and GPS coordinates.

25
00:01:25,645 --> 00:01:30,475
Now multiply that by approximately
1900 sensors working in

26
00:01:30,475 --> 00:01:32,095
perfect harmony in space.

27
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:37,615
And because there is no garage in orbit,
these systems are built to survive intense

28
00:01:37,615 --> 00:01:39,715
radiations and freezing temperatures.

29
00:01:40,045 --> 00:01:43,495
From somewhere between minus
55 to 85 degrees Celsius.

30
00:01:43,915 --> 00:01:48,235
Now let me walk you through a simple
example of how this infrastructure works.

31
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:50,135
imagine a rocket launch.

32
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:54,075
picture the rocket, like a smart
delivery van loaded with hundreds

33
00:01:54,075 --> 00:01:58,305
of sensors, each one, keeping an eye
on temperature, pressure, vibration.

34
00:01:58,695 --> 00:02:01,065
And much more as it
races through the space.

35
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:06,075
As a rocket lifts off, each sensor starts
collecting its own kind of information,

36
00:02:06,315 --> 00:02:11,115
like how hard the engine is, how much the
rocket is shaking, or how fast it's going.

37
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:15,105
These are like real time text
messages from each sensor saying,

38
00:02:15,405 --> 00:02:16,905
here's what I'm feeling right now.

39
00:02:17,265 --> 00:02:21,255
All these messages are routed to
what's called a remote data acquisition

40
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:26,605
unit onboard, an central inbox that's
receiving thousands of emails per second.

41
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,110
This unit organizes the data, filters
out the noise and compresses it to

42
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,010
make it easier to send just like
zipping files before emailing them.

43
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,230
Then this cleansed and compressed data is
transmitted back to earth, specifically

44
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,910
to a ground station, which is like the
Rocket's home base or an IT department.

45
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,050
Once it arrives, it's stored,
decoded, and analyzed in real

46
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,250
time by scientists and in.

47
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,990
So in short, there were sensors,
acquisition unit, and then

48
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,130
transmission, and then ground station,
and then storage and analysis.

49
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,900
This entire lifecycle repeats hundreds
of times per second, ensuring we never

50
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,280
miss a heartbeat of the emission.

51
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,330
So what makes this entire
process possible is the rugged

52
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,010
radiation proof infrastructure.

53
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,540
Imagine having to keep your laptop
running during an earthquake, inside

54
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,790
a volcano, and with no tech support.

55
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,220
That's what our hardware
is built for, its space.

56
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,040
next we're gonna talk about the signal
crossing and how the ground support works.

57
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:30,730
Think of the sensors like a music
instruments in space, orchestra.

58
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,314
they're playing data notes,
vibration voltage position at

59
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:38,914
different tempos from 25 to hundred
times per second back on earth.

60
00:03:39,214 --> 00:03:42,354
Our job is to make sure we
hear every single note clearly.

61
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:46,864
We use advanced filters to cut the
noise and keep the signal clean

62
00:03:46,984 --> 00:03:50,914
even when the data is flying at
4.5 million times per second.

63
00:03:51,394 --> 00:03:54,214
All of this is sync
perfectly to the microsecond.

64
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:58,084
That's like marching band
performing in perfect rhythm

65
00:03:58,114 --> 00:03:59,704
across different continents.

66
00:04:00,064 --> 00:04:03,274
So let me talk on how data
travels from Rocket to.

67
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,750
think of rocket as an,
texting earth from space.

68
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,560
It sends the data through radio
laser signals, like sending a

69
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,810
message through invisible waves.

70
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,730
Sometimes a satellite in the orbit
helps by acting as a postman who picks

71
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,840
up the message and hands it off to a
ground station that's ground station,

72
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,150
receives it using a huge antenna, decodes
the message, checks for the error, and

73
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,920
then stores it safely in a data center.

74
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,520
The system makes sure we get
every single piece of valuable

75
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,530
information sent from the space.

76
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,270
next we talk about the high
performance computing architecture.

77
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,450
in space, you can't afford a
system cache, literally, right?

78
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,855
So if something goes wrong, then
your entire mission goes down.

79
00:04:45,195 --> 00:04:49,890
So we build our processors to be super
reliable and incredibly efficient.

80
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,960
They can run high speed data operations
using less energy than a regular phone

81
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,600
charger while surviving radiation
that would fry your laptop with triple

82
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,820
backups and automatic error fixing.

83
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,420
It's like having a car that
can fix a flat tire before you

84
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,920
even notice something is wrong.

85
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,840
So next we talk about the real
time processing and how the

86
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,219
fault management, happens.

87
00:05:13,695 --> 00:05:17,715
every command sent to the spacecraft
must be executed quickly and correctly.

88
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,155
No delays, no mistakes.

89
00:05:19,425 --> 00:05:23,295
Imagine trying to steer a remote control
tone from millions of miles away.

90
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:27,105
That's what we do with under 10
milliseconds of delay faster than

91
00:05:27,105 --> 00:05:30,555
blinking, and if something goes
wrong, the system can detect and

92
00:05:30,555 --> 00:05:32,325
fix the issue in less than a second.

93
00:05:32,685 --> 00:05:34,275
That's the space level resilience.

94
00:05:34,775 --> 00:05:38,555
Now let's look at the James
Web Space Telescope, our cosmic

95
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:43,025
photographer, it captures up to
40 gigs of space images every day.

96
00:05:43,055 --> 00:05:46,625
Think of it like downloading
10,000 high resolution photos

97
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,425
daily from a million miles away.

98
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:53,735
And once it collects this gold mine of
data, a smart system stores organizers

99
00:05:53,915 --> 00:05:56,180
and process it with surgical precision.

100
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,010
Producing results within eight
to 10 hours with 98% perfection.

101
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,870
So now let's talk about emerging
technologies in the space compute.

102
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,460
We are now using tools inspired by
the future edge computing, quantum

103
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,590
techniques, and, mission learning.

104
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,970
Edge computing lets us spacecraft
think onboard instead of waiting for

105
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,960
a, just like your phone, using face
recognition without needing the internet.

106
00:06:20,335 --> 00:06:25,105
We also have AI on board processing
8.7 trillion operations per second.

107
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:29,125
Helping space instruments make
parter decisions in real time.

108
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,715
So usually talking to the
spacecraft isn't easy.

109
00:06:32,745 --> 00:06:35,780
It's like shouting across oceans
and hoping your voice is clear.

110
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,045
But we now use light beams, which is,
optical communication and advanced

111
00:06:41,045 --> 00:06:46,595
frequencies that lets us stock up to
1.2 gigs as fast as your home wifi.

112
00:06:46,985 --> 00:06:50,915
The system adapts if signal is
weak, like your phone switching

113
00:06:50,915 --> 00:06:53,255
from 5G to 4G to stay connector.

114
00:06:53,755 --> 00:06:58,405
So looking ahead, we are building a case
craft that can think, feel, and adapt.

115
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,810
Neural networks on board can make fast
autonomous decisions with 95% accuracy.

116
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:10,390
Like an astronaut's digital brain
and quantum sensors offer 20 times

117
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:14,500
more precise measurements like
switching from an wall clock to

118
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,625
an automatic clock when you need
perfect timing for the deep space.

119
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:21,755
And finally, the space isn't
just for the governments anymore.

120
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:23,675
It's like booming commercially.

121
00:07:23,975 --> 00:07:27,875
The global space industry is
worth over four 20 billion with

122
00:07:28,385 --> 00:07:30,275
80% driven by private companies.

123
00:07:30,305 --> 00:07:34,685
Think of SpaceX, blue origin, and
startups launching satellites faster

124
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:39,245
and cheaper than ever with launching
costs, dropping and innovation rising.

125
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:42,515
The space economy is
growing at over 7% a year.

126
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,040
And data engineering is at
the heart of this gold rush.

127
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:51,250
So with that, thank you for joining me
on this journey into the world of large

128
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,840
scale data engineering in space, from
powerful processes to fault tolerance

129
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,730
systems, and real-time intelligence.

130
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,270
The work we do behind the
scenes keeps missions running.

131
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,440
Discovery is flowing and humanity
exploring further than never before.

132
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,610
Thank you everyone.
