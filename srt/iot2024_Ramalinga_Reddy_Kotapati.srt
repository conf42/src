1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,430
I'm going to discuss about the advances
in physical design for next generation

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,959
with FinFET and GAA technologies.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,889
GAA means gate all around technology.

4
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:16,979
These both FinFET and gate
around technologies are

5
00:00:17,409 --> 00:00:19,399
advanced CMOS technologies.

6
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:21,949
CMOS means Complementary
Metal Oxide Semiconductor.

7
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:28,689
So with this FinFET and GA for the
advanced nodes, it is helping improve

8
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:34,810
the leakage power and the frequency
and the area of the chip designs.

9
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,140
So I'm going to discuss these
ones in the coming slides.

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,910
This is the FinFET like it has
the substrate, source and drain.

11
00:00:43,975 --> 00:00:47,154
are connected with the gate.

12
00:00:47,654 --> 00:00:50,624
Gate has the control of the channel
between the source and drain.

13
00:00:51,124 --> 00:00:55,584
Basically source emits the electrons
and drain will collect that and

14
00:00:55,584 --> 00:01:00,934
gate will control that majority of
the carriers or like the electrons.

15
00:01:01,874 --> 00:01:05,874
So compared to the planar
transistor, gate is better

16
00:01:06,294 --> 00:01:08,094
controllability of the channel here.

17
00:01:08,684 --> 00:01:09,664
Because of that.

18
00:01:10,164 --> 00:01:16,874
In advanced nodes till 28 nanometer,
we were using like the pin fats.

19
00:01:17,374 --> 00:01:21,154
So it has like a better switching
times and higher current density

20
00:01:21,724 --> 00:01:24,304
compared with the plan transistors.

21
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:29,339
we call like the source and rain,
the channel we call it as like fin.

22
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,669
We can have like multiple
fins under a gate.

23
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:34,829
It'll improve the.

24
00:01:35,169 --> 00:01:40,769
the leakage power and the
current driving capabilities.

25
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:47,619
So as the technology is scaling,
then we are like multiple things.

26
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,029
So if you're coming to that GAA
technologies, so GAA is adding like

27
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:59,719
multiple planar transistors all
together, but it can be stacked.

28
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:04,059
in the diagram, you see the diagram,
Deep learner transistor is the first one.

29
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:07,559
It has, source and drain, and
controlled by very limited

30
00:02:07,809 --> 00:02:08,929
controllability of the gate.

31
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,184
Of the gate, it has the less
controllability of the channel.

32
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:14,129
The second one is the FinFET.

33
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:18,429
Gate has the better
controllability of the channel.

34
00:02:18,929 --> 00:02:22,224
And the gate around technology.

35
00:02:22,284 --> 00:02:25,994
It has the surrounded with, the channel
is surrounded completely with the gate.

36
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:30,964
So it has better controllability and,
for the lower technology nodes, what

37
00:02:30,964 --> 00:02:35,864
are the issues we are facing with the
planar transistors are mitigated with

38
00:02:35,914 --> 00:02:40,774
the pinfix and what are the issues
we are facing with the pinfix are

39
00:02:40,854 --> 00:02:43,174
fixed with the gate around technology.

40
00:02:43,924 --> 00:02:50,074
Low end currently nodes we are using
the gate around to improve the drive

41
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:56,884
strength, leakage, to reduce the power
and improve the enhance the performance.

42
00:02:57,384 --> 00:03:03,834
So evolution from FinFET to GA, the
limitation from the planar transistors

43
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:09,964
are addressed with FinFET technology and
The FinFETs giving the better performance

44
00:03:10,144 --> 00:03:12,784
and scalability, for the chip design.

45
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:17,934
what are the issues now with the
FinFETs like not able to resolve for

46
00:03:17,994 --> 00:03:24,744
the advanced semiconductor technologies
like 2nm, 3nm, 2nm, 3nm technologies.

47
00:03:25,034 --> 00:03:27,874
Those issues we are solving with the TAA.

48
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:28,524
So this

49
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:34,659
impact of the ties and requirements,
with the GAA is they layout complexity.

50
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:42,944
We have so many complex rules for
the GA technology and also we have a

51
00:03:42,964 --> 00:03:48,409
lot of economic challenges they might
pitch quite reduce, and we have to go

52
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:50,114
with that one instead of strategies.

53
00:03:50,614 --> 00:03:57,784
To fix all the DRC issues and go with
the multi cut VRS and fix the congestion

54
00:03:57,784 --> 00:04:03,544
issues And all of that power distribution
is one of the other challenge Like we

55
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:08,464
have to properly plan the power Before
otherwise like we may end up with a lot

56
00:04:08,464 --> 00:04:15,684
of power in the design in the chip so
proper planning of the power with the

57
00:04:16,104 --> 00:04:20,374
Less number of, like reducing the pitch
and with, reducing the metal width.

58
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:25,114
So properly, estimation is very
much required for the power

59
00:04:25,114 --> 00:04:27,694
distribution and electrometration.

60
00:04:27,694 --> 00:04:30,224
So we have to adopt
like advanced EDA tools.

61
00:04:30,224 --> 00:04:34,624
like machine learning integration should
be there for the advanced EDA tools.

62
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:37,329
to work on this GAA technologies.

63
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:41,129
This AI powered tool software with
the layout and the brick design

64
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:46,169
shows much earlier, so they can
help like the convergence and

65
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:47,959
improve the quality of the results.

66
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:53,739
In the GAA, we were having like
multi pattern like metals and

67
00:04:53,739 --> 00:04:57,589
even the standard cell pins are
having the multi pattern format.

68
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:03,419
the tools, GAA tools should understand
All of these multi pattern rules and

69
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:09,289
enable to legalize like moving the
standard cells and routing the middle

70
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:15,099
layers, like corresponding multi patterns
aware on that, otherwise like we may

71
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:20,489
end up with a lot of shorts, DRCs, and
even like the congestion may increase.

72
00:05:21,249 --> 00:05:24,029
So I'd want you to use
should help on that.

73
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:26,369
The three C is in support.

74
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:32,509
This is like multiple, advanced tools
should handle all of these ones, like

75
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:36,389
we have to day interface effectively,
for this, TDSC design support.

76
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:39,849
design strategies for advanced nodes
are like, standard cell optimization,

77
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:44,909
like the customer standard cell leverage
for GA capabilities, track height

78
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:51,129
reduction, and, pin access optimization
of key, focus areas for the standard

79
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:53,799
cell optimization and clocked synthesis.

80
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:58,199
We have to properly fix the
latency and skew numbers.

81
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:03,019
And also we can go with the multi
point CTS for the clocked synthesis.

82
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:09,179
For the advanced nodes and signaling,
it is the one of the major challenges.

83
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:15,669
With the GAA or advanced technology
because of the nets are more dominated.

84
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,769
So it will cause the signal
integrity challenges.

85
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,499
So we have to go with the
shielding and the buffer insertion

86
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:25,039
strategies to fix all these issues.

87
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:32,579
DFM integration design for manufacturing
Like the, whatever we are going to

88
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:36,659
manufacture, we have to address all of
that issues much easier like multi cut

89
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:40,419
vias and like even the metal phase.

90
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:46,209
All of that we should take care of
right with the advanced technologies to

91
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:51,659
better correlation between the design
before and after the manufacturing.

92
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:56,539
So if you compare the power performance
and area numbers between the FinFET

93
00:06:56,549 --> 00:07:03,499
and GA, the power is 20 percent
improved compared with the basic

94
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,599
like the FinFET technologies on the
advanced nodes and the performance is

95
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:12,779
like 15 percent improved on the lower
technology like low technology nodes.

96
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:17,599
Area is also 30 percent improved
compared with FinFET designs.

97
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:20,309
So overall there is a better
improvement with the GAA.

98
00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:23,369
So the challenges in
high density chip design.

99
00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:28,509
There are like more challenges,
like highly dense designs.

100
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:32,129
Like the thermal management
is the critical one.

101
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:37,089
We have to use like advanced cooling
solutions and thermal wire placement.

102
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:39,049
IR drop, IR wire placement.

103
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:40,479
before going for.

104
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:47,429
on the placement and in the clock
tree optimization, use the better VT

105
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:50,779
combinations and also variability control.

106
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:55,299
we have to use the POCV and
EOCV, for process variations.

107
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:58,519
Yield optimization is, one
of the thing, like we have to

108
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:03,869
properly optimize the yield to
correlate after the manufacturing.

109
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:10,649
we have to use the advanced design
techniques like, multi, multi cut VRs and,

110
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:14,923
multi, like the DFM rules and all of that.

111
00:08:15,423 --> 00:08:18,163
For high speed designs, we
have to properly take care

112
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:19,613
of the clock distribution.

113
00:08:20,113 --> 00:08:23,463
If, like the clock distribution is
a crucial thing for the high speed

114
00:08:23,493 --> 00:08:28,363
designs, We have to properly plan the
clock, like which clocks are, the main

115
00:08:28,363 --> 00:08:30,923
clocks, which are, like, derived clocks.

116
00:08:31,283 --> 00:08:35,343
We have to properly build the clock
tree for that, and even, the, try for

117
00:08:35,343 --> 00:08:39,603
the first clocks, and not building
the clock tree for the test clock.

118
00:08:40,173 --> 00:08:42,273
we have to properly distribute the clock.

119
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:44,843
Otherwise, we may end
up with a lot of power.

120
00:08:45,343 --> 00:08:48,003
power issues and a lot of area issues.

121
00:08:48,513 --> 00:08:51,463
If you are not properly estimate the
clock distribution and also like we

122
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:53,143
can't meet the performance of the design.

123
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:55,603
So other thing is like signal integrity.

124
00:08:56,033 --> 00:09:00,233
If you are not properly fixing the signal
integrity, we may end up with a lot of

125
00:09:00,243 --> 00:09:03,133
crosstalk issues and like noise issues.

126
00:09:03,653 --> 00:09:10,593
So we have to properly estimate
before going for the Routing, go for

127
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:16,283
higher metal routing and giving the
proper NDR rules, non default rules

128
00:09:16,283 --> 00:09:18,763
to fix that signal integrity issues.

129
00:09:18,763 --> 00:09:22,043
And also the on chip communication,
like efficient data movement within

130
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:25,793
the chip, like we are using the CDIS
and architecture for the automation.

131
00:09:26,293 --> 00:09:30,863
So feature directions are 3D integration
in the physical design, like the,

132
00:09:31,353 --> 00:09:34,273
we have to stack the multiple dice
with the different technologies.

133
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:34,373
Thank you.

134
00:09:34,923 --> 00:09:39,773
So the EDA tool should chop out all
of these ones and quantum computing,

135
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:45,143
the physical design tools out of the
quantum designs, but also able to

136
00:09:45,143 --> 00:09:49,743
optimize those ones and, fix those ones,
the issues with the quantum designs.

137
00:09:50,243 --> 00:09:54,709
And also the advanced design,
the analog and mixed signal

138
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:57,211
integration will become the crucial.

139
00:09:57,921 --> 00:10:01,151
So the EDA tool should, mitigate
these issues in the advanced

140
00:10:01,151 --> 00:10:02,461
with advanced technologies.

141
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:09,631
Coming to the conclusions, in the GAA, we
are continuously scaling the technology

142
00:10:09,701 --> 00:10:16,571
with the GAA and we are adopting like
more AI driven methodologies to optimize

143
00:10:16,571 --> 00:10:22,541
the designs to correlate the design
with the manufacture, manufacturing.

144
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,911
and also we are heterogeneous
integration, like we are integrating

145
00:10:26,921 --> 00:10:30,661
multiple dice on the same package.

146
00:10:31,341 --> 00:10:37,361
So this is the like, conclusion from
the advanced nodes with the GKA.

147
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:39,001
So thank you very much.
