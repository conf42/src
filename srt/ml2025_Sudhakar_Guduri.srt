1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,580
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,620
I'm aka from the Trust King, and I do
have 14 years of experience in the data

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,914
ing tools such as Informatica exercise.

4
00:00:11,174 --> 00:00:16,204
Data stage and Matillion, and also having
experience in the reporting tools such

5
00:00:16,204 --> 00:00:24,064
as SSRS Cognos and also having vast
experience in the backend databases such

6
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,974
as Sequence Server, ours, snowflake.

7
00:00:27,024 --> 00:00:30,354
And I am exit to talk to you today
about how ing the multiple data

8
00:00:30,354 --> 00:00:33,864
integration tools can be a game changer
in your data engineering career.

9
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:37,339
The data ecosystem is evolving rapidly.

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,709
Demand is shipping from the tools
specialist to the S integrators.

11
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:45,279
Let me share a quick personal observation.

12
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:49,959
Like when I started a career, I
slowly focused on the informatic.

13
00:00:50,529 --> 00:00:55,419
It served me well, but I soon realized
like job roles demands broader efficiency

14
00:00:55,419 --> 00:01:00,250
across the multiple platforms, especially
in the hybrid and the cloud environment.

15
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,259
So let me.

16
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:05,084
Move to slide.

17
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:08,325
So the ch let me explain
about the changing landscape

18
00:01:08,325 --> 00:01:09,825
of the data integration.

19
00:01:09,825 --> 00:01:14,265
Year by year, the data complexities
growing the, it's demand for the more

20
00:01:14,265 --> 00:01:19,805
data sources like APIs, streaming
internet, other things on premises on

21
00:01:19,805 --> 00:01:23,515
a hybrid, cloud hybrid and also for
the diverse consumers like BI tools,

22
00:01:24,175 --> 00:01:26,664
my pipelines, and business apps.

23
00:01:26,714 --> 00:01:31,195
And nowadays, like traditional
tools no longer fit in all needs.

24
00:01:31,854 --> 00:01:35,945
So the employees started moving
to the multi tool strategies for

25
00:01:35,945 --> 00:01:37,685
flexibility on the scalable team.

26
00:01:37,745 --> 00:01:42,755
Let me provide an example where a
retail company may use Informatica

27
00:01:43,024 --> 00:01:45,684
for the bulk data warehousing.

28
00:01:46,285 --> 00:01:51,535
And AP fee for I got streaming
and telling for the cleansing

29
00:01:51,595 --> 00:01:53,425
and for the data governance.

30
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:55,345
Let me move to the next slide.

31
00:01:56,345 --> 00:02:00,645
Why multiple skills made means like
if the professional skill with the

32
00:02:00,645 --> 00:02:06,519
multiple tools they can demand up
to 42% has salaries and add advance

33
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:09,320
like 3 5, 3 0.5 faster in the career.

34
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:16,260
Growth and the benefits of a multi tool
skills, like a better job mobile team and

35
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,820
increase the leadership opportunities and
probably solve edge and cloud readiness.

36
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,909
Let me move on to the n slide
where we have a market analysis.

37
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,529
So if you look this chart these are
the tools like which has like a high

38
00:02:30,529 --> 00:02:36,639
demand, informatica and Apache and
AWS Q, Microsoft, a D, F these are

39
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,399
the major major do dominated tools.

40
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:42,679
So coming to the next slide
we have three key platforms.

41
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:47,239
One is Informatica, it is the
in the healthcare industry.

42
00:02:47,614 --> 00:02:50,704
So it is these are the key
features like AI power solutions

43
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:53,284
and deep health integrations
and the enterprise scalability.

44
00:02:54,124 --> 00:02:57,394
And then coming to the tail
end it is enterprise grade with

45
00:02:57,394 --> 00:02:58,954
the broad connectivity options.

46
00:02:58,954 --> 00:03:01,509
Like it has unique features like
the unified platform on the.

47
00:03:02,404 --> 00:03:04,624
Robust governance and
the cloud native options.

48
00:03:05,024 --> 00:03:08,834
And like when coming to the Apache
initially it's one of the fortune finer

49
00:03:08,834 --> 00:03:10,574
data first with the visual programming.

50
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:14,384
So where we have the key features
as like a drag and drop interface.

51
00:03:14,954 --> 00:03:17,894
Real time processing and
provision and seeing tracking.

52
00:03:17,984 --> 00:03:21,214
And also, apart from these, like
we do have AWS glue and the, and

53
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:25,759
data factory where it has like
serverless cloud native supports

54
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,749
transformation via spark pipelines.

55
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:30,619
And coming to the glue, so glue
good for the metadata catalog

56
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,509
and the schema discovery.

57
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:34,109
Let me move on to the next slide.

58
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:38,449
So by using these tools, these are the
critical capabilities where like we can,

59
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:43,579
automate like the workflows up to 5%
and 68% for the data quality management,

60
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:47,779
and 42% for the advanced processes.

61
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,054
Let me move on to the next slide.

62
00:03:49,284 --> 00:03:51,169
This are the real time case studies.

63
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,159
One of the example is the FinTech success.

64
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:57,119
If you see here, the challenge
for the FinTech is where they have

65
00:03:57,119 --> 00:04:00,709
a complex language systems with
200 data sourcing data sources.

66
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:03,389
So this are causing like
increasing the cost.

67
00:04:03,734 --> 00:04:07,534
So for this challenge, like
the better solution is adopting

68
00:04:07,534 --> 00:04:08,854
like a multiple integration.

69
00:04:09,154 --> 00:04:13,724
So by using either the, on the
talent orchestrations, so the better.

70
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:17,884
So by using this approach the best
result is they can say $2.8 million

71
00:04:18,034 --> 00:04:23,474
amount and also stiff first and first
crossing and coming to the second example.

72
00:04:24,254 --> 00:04:28,484
Where they allocate transformation like
by using the Informatica tool for client

73
00:04:28,484 --> 00:04:31,724
processing, it's taking around like 48
hours for the data processing with them.

74
00:04:32,174 --> 00:04:36,074
And also they are getting the frequent
errors like so to work on this, like

75
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:40,580
they implemented like different approach
the real the real time integrations.

76
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:44,964
So they improved, like validation,
reducing errors by 75%.

77
00:04:45,059 --> 00:04:48,119
Nearly the real time
process with 98.8 accuracy.

78
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:52,059
Let me move on to the, on next
slide, like the next slide that

79
00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:53,809
talks about learning the framework.

80
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:57,019
So first of all, like we need to
be, have a foundation building.

81
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:01,504
And in the foundation building,
like we have like a. The key

82
00:05:01,504 --> 00:05:04,994
features, like a complete option,
certifications and better to have

83
00:05:05,034 --> 00:05:07,554
multiple products, practices, and then.

84
00:05:08,164 --> 00:05:12,354
You need to have have expansion phase,
like you add a second platform and

85
00:05:12,405 --> 00:05:16,724
identify the similar pattern and
solve the same problems differently.

86
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:21,025
And also have like integration mastery
so command to strategy drive to

87
00:05:21,025 --> 00:05:25,545
develop a project like by using one
or more tools, so the, coming to the

88
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:29,314
next slide it's a skill development
roadmap where we have a learning

89
00:05:29,774 --> 00:05:32,264
practice and applying and sharing.

90
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:35,835
So when coming to the learning you
need to have a strategic course and

91
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:41,505
documentation and you need to have a
practice, hands on the practice, hands

92
00:05:41,505 --> 00:05:45,075
on the project implementation, and also
apply like when doing the practice,

93
00:05:45,075 --> 00:05:49,275
apply, the reward implementation at work,
and also whatever, can share like with

94
00:05:49,275 --> 00:05:54,664
the community community, and also can
participate can participate on mentoring.

95
00:05:56,794 --> 00:06:02,245
So coming to the next slide so the
way of the tool masteries the career

96
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:06,395
investment so structural learning tool
like four to 60 was of the targeted goals.

97
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:10,114
So we do one 20 hours of building
up so realtime solutions.

98
00:06:10,164 --> 00:06:13,224
And professional returns are
like you can measurably carry

99
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:14,994
advancement within 60 to 12 hours.

100
00:06:15,714 --> 00:06:17,544
And coming to the final impact, right?

101
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,459
You have a 15 to 25 platform.

102
00:06:20,994 --> 00:06:24,384
So it's going to be like immediate
based composition increase and

103
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,494
performance bonus ification.

104
00:06:27,024 --> 00:06:30,894
So coming to the next slide, like we
have an action plan, like where we have

105
00:06:30,964 --> 00:06:35,984
the self-assessment and set platform
goals and create a learning schedule

106
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:40,304
and build across platform project, so
when coming to the self-assessment,

107
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:44,594
like you need to be current tool
frequency where we are on that.

108
00:06:44,734 --> 00:06:47,044
And also coming to the platform goals.

109
00:06:47,524 --> 00:06:51,004
Choose the complement rules based
on the current market demand.

110
00:06:51,064 --> 00:06:54,304
And also you should have to spend at
least five to 10 hours with you to

111
00:06:54,404 --> 00:06:59,414
new platform skills and demonstrate
the master tools integrated solutions.

112
00:06:59,414 --> 00:07:02,009
This solves about the multi tool skills.

113
00:07:02,109 --> 00:07:05,619
So if you have any questions
you can drop me an email.

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,515
Thanks for the, for providing
this opportunity to.
