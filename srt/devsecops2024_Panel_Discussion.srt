00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,920
Hello, my name is Chandler Mayo, and
I'm a developer advocate at Doppler.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,950
Today, I'm going to talk a little
bit about how AI is potentially

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:07,770
coming for your secrets.

4
00:00:08,725 --> 00:00:11,585
At Doppler, we're a developer
first secrets management platform.

5
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:15,375
Usually when we think about secrets,
we're thinking about things like API

6
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:19,704
keys and certificates, and that's what we
protect for developers with our platform.

7
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:24,725
As such, we're constantly thinking
about developers needs, and AI is

8
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:28,455
one of those things that has come up
quite a bit recently, with all the

9
00:00:28,455 --> 00:00:30,825
different advancements and things
that you can do with generative AI.

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,940
there's definitely a risk to
security, risking your secrets

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,350
actually being exposed, or the wrong
person, tricking an AI into revealing

12
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,540
something that it shouldn't do.

13
00:00:41,485 --> 00:00:44,455
In tech, we usually want to
move fast and break things.

14
00:00:44,555 --> 00:00:47,185
if you're too slow, your
competitor will beat you to market.

15
00:00:47,645 --> 00:00:51,785
And generative AI is making that even
more complicated, because with generative

16
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:56,075
AI, companies can also iterate faster
and create things potentially faster.

17
00:00:56,435 --> 00:01:00,175
but there's a risk to security when it
comes to that's often underthought out.

18
00:01:00,655 --> 00:01:04,345
you want to move fast and break things,
But also it doesn't really matter if

19
00:01:04,345 --> 00:01:07,964
you leak all of your customer data
because you improperly use generative AI.

20
00:01:07,964 --> 00:01:12,285
Generative AI is also being used
to do things like create more

21
00:01:12,285 --> 00:01:13,925
sophisticated phishing attacks.

22
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:18,535
Phishing attacks are the bane of every
security team and chances are you

23
00:01:18,535 --> 00:01:21,725
probably had to go through training
and have to go through it every year

24
00:01:21,955 --> 00:01:23,615
to learn how to avoid phishing attacks.

25
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,440
A lot of us think phishing
attacks are just something that,

26
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,810
your grandma would fall for.

27
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,280
And that's because traditionally
they've worked by just sending out

28
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,930
millions of emails to millions of
users and trying to get just a small

29
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,600
percentage of them to respond back.

30
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,050
But with generative AI, things are
getting a lot more complicated.

31
00:01:40,495 --> 00:01:43,595
With generative AI, you could
scrape someone's profile, create a

32
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:47,565
customized email, and target them
directly and automate that across

33
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:51,375
millions of users, so your response
rate could go up significantly.

34
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:54,365
You can also automate responses
to them and make it sound

35
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:55,785
really authentic and real.

36
00:01:56,285 --> 00:01:59,985
In the same space, deepfakes are
also becoming extremely concerning.

37
00:02:00,345 --> 00:02:04,125
If you're able to replicate someone's
image and their voice, you can

38
00:02:04,155 --> 00:02:07,385
create a really convincing story for
someone who's not suspecting that.

39
00:02:07,735 --> 00:02:10,635
Like phishing attacks, ransomware
attacks are also getting more

40
00:02:10,635 --> 00:02:12,565
sophisticated, thanks to generative AI.

41
00:02:13,295 --> 00:02:17,405
Now, ransomware attacks can be almost
entirely automated, which means you

42
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:19,265
can do more of them at the same time.

43
00:02:19,635 --> 00:02:23,525
You can also customize them to go
after individual targets better,

44
00:02:23,815 --> 00:02:26,225
because different companies are
going to have different concerns,

45
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:27,535
and you can exploit that.

46
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:32,715
Another way that generative AI is leaking
information is through jailbreaking it.

47
00:02:32,835 --> 00:02:36,295
A lot of companies are using AI to power
different features of their platform

48
00:02:36,585 --> 00:02:41,655
unaware that those AIs can be exploited
to basically derail from their safeguards

49
00:02:41,655 --> 00:02:43,274
and expose things that they shouldn't.

50
00:02:43,774 --> 00:02:46,754
According to the state of security,
2020 full report from Splunk.

51
00:02:46,845 --> 00:02:50,515
Generative AI adoption is
absolutely outpacing policy.

52
00:02:51,265 --> 00:02:54,674
And that's not really surprising
because the technology is evolving

53
00:02:54,685 --> 00:02:57,035
faster than anyone can really
think about how to use it.

54
00:02:57,464 --> 00:03:00,124
But that doesn't mean that companies
shouldn't be identifying their

55
00:03:00,124 --> 00:03:03,765
potential use cases, establishing
some sort of framework with ethical

56
00:03:03,774 --> 00:03:09,475
principles, outlining how they want to
safeguard privacy, as well as educating

57
00:03:09,554 --> 00:03:13,425
their employees on how to use AI
properly and designate accountability

58
00:03:13,435 --> 00:03:14,985
for who's responsible for AI.

59
00:03:15,415 --> 00:03:16,165
And then of course.

60
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,640
update and review the
legal side of things.

61
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,850
With all of these things to
consider, overreactions are often

62
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,679
a concern with generative AI.

63
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,700
Some companies have decided that
the best approach is to just not

64
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,360
use it at all, and as a result,
their engineering teams move slower.

65
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,500
They can't create tests as fast, they
can't create code as fast, but it might

66
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,120
be necessary depending on their industry.

67
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,660
But you have to face the
consequences of that.

68
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,710
When your competitor is using generative
AI to create stuff faster than you are.

69
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,159
In most countries, AI regulation is
still a patchwork because we're not

70
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,310
totally sure what to pay attention
to and what not to pay attention to.

71
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,140
But we do know that AI needs to be very
carefully used in critical systems.

72
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,500
The European.

73
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,440
Union recently passed
the European Artificial

74
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,470
Intelligence Act, or the AI Act.

75
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,850
The idea of this is to basically
leave simple uses of AI almost

76
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,350
completely unregulated and only
regulate it in high risk environments

77
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,650
and in high risk software.

78
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,539
This is a pretty common sense
approach, but unfortunately, it'll

79
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,290
have to continue to be adapted as
AI evolves and as we continue to

80
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,090
have other AI security concerns.

81
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,004
Most of the time, the government
being slow to implement it.

82
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:26,165
Embrace technology can work to
different companies advantages

83
00:04:26,195 --> 00:04:29,295
by giving them time to innovate
before regulations are imposed.

84
00:04:29,695 --> 00:04:32,485
But in this case, AI can
be extremely dangerous.

85
00:04:32,645 --> 00:04:37,664
It could expose user information in
ways that we've never considered before.

86
00:04:38,174 --> 00:04:40,414
And so it's up to individual
developers to make sure they're

87
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:43,149
implementing it responsibly
while the government catches up.

88
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:46,069
Of course, it's not just
developers who have access to

89
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,989
API keys and secrets and data.

90
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:51,519
So I'm going to leverage my team at
Doppler to take a look at how different

91
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:54,999
departments are leveraging AI and how
they're thinking about the security

92
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:56,679
of the AI features that they use.

93
00:04:57,579 --> 00:05:00,049
Would you please introduce
yourself and your role at Doppler?

94
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:00,899
Yeah.

95
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:02,379
so I'm Amber Britton.

96
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:04,079
I'm head of go to market at Doppler.

97
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:07,619
I oversee all of marketing,
dev rel, and product growth.

98
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:12,519
I have a team of five, so a small
little team, but we're responsible

99
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:17,859
for generating traffic to Doppler, the
product at our marketing site, and then

100
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:23,079
generating signups and leads to our sales
team as well as self service customers.

101
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,019
How is your team using AI and how
are you as an individual using AI?

102
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,689
Yeah, for the team we are We're
definitely using AI to be more efficient.

103
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:36,339
Every marketer I know pretty much
is using AI in some way, so to help

104
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:41,019
get you, 70, 80 percent of the way
there for some new project, in terms,

105
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:42,779
like mostly it's pretty superficial.

106
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:48,169
Like we're using it for copy help, help in
generating copy for social or copy ideas.

107
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:52,879
But from a security standpoint,
in terms of the data it ingests.

108
00:05:53,194 --> 00:05:56,514
We're very careful about what
to give it, especially being

109
00:05:56,514 --> 00:05:57,664
at a company like Doppler.

110
00:05:57,844 --> 00:06:02,274
We do give it, I found the most
benefit for the team is to give it data

111
00:06:02,294 --> 00:06:06,614
from different sources and help with
analysis and synthesis of that data.

112
00:06:06,654 --> 00:06:09,934
Things that could take days or
weeks can now be done in seconds.

113
00:06:10,429 --> 00:06:14,749
So thinking of there was an example where
I took a bunch of our reviews from some

114
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:18,839
third party review sites, no identifiable
information about who gave that

115
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,069
review, but just the copy of it itself.

116
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:26,379
put that into GPT to look for different
themes among, among that data about

117
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:30,659
like pain points or benefits about
our product that we could then use

118
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:34,039
to distill both for the organization
to know, and then for future plans.

119
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:35,709
so that, that's the kind of data.

120
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:40,049
Occasionally, it might also give
it some metrics data on here's some

121
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:45,149
analysis on how many page views we
had or clicks we had on something

122
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:48,279
on our marketing site and over this
period of time versus this period of

123
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:52,189
time and look for these differences
or look for trends or themes or ideas.

124
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:56,849
Again, not giving it any personally
identifiable information about who did

125
00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:00,744
those visits or who the users were that
contributed to those visits, but just

126
00:07:00,744 --> 00:07:04,554
the data itself and help with reducing
the time it would take to do that

127
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:06,184
synthesis and analysis on your own.

128
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:10,364
It's almost like having another
team member who's Instead of having

129
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:14,354
to necessarily hire a data analyst
right now, we're getting that, the

130
00:07:14,354 --> 00:07:17,484
benefit of that help or brainstorming
with a virtual team member.

131
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:21,234
In the interest of data security, what
rules do you think are most important

132
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:23,514
for your team when using generative AI?

133
00:07:23,514 --> 00:07:27,684
So it's definitely important to be on
the same page about what data is allowed

134
00:07:27,684 --> 00:07:30,514
to go into an AI tool and what is not.

135
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:35,749
for my team, we're very clear on
what's personally identifiable.

136
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:37,219
That's very important to us as a company.

137
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:41,649
So making sure we're not putting in,
names of organizations that use us or,

138
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:45,699
Information that could ever be traced back
to a user, not doing anything like that.

139
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:49,179
That's why when I mentioned, we'll
use high level metric data about

140
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:52,269
performance of something, but not
who contributed to that performance.

141
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:57,079
In addition to that, you also, I would
also consider something sensitive to

142
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,989
be about how the company is performing.

143
00:07:58,989 --> 00:08:00,209
We're a private startup.

144
00:08:00,549 --> 00:08:02,299
A lot of our customers
are private startups.

145
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:03,999
A lot of marketers I know
are at private startups.

146
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,879
your financial information about
how your company is performing

147
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,179
is not public knowledge.

148
00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:12,659
And so anything that you don't want
basically read aloud in a courtroom,

149
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:16,539
you should not put into an AI
tool, unless you are the owner and

150
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:18,399
creator of that AI tool potentially.

151
00:08:18,609 --> 00:08:23,579
so not putting in any, information about
how our company is doing financially

152
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,479
or, that would be essentially personally
identifiable to us and could be

153
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:31,299
something that we didn't want public
at this moment on any other small

154
00:08:31,299 --> 00:08:32,599
startup would be in the same boat.

155
00:08:32,609 --> 00:08:37,439
So knowing that is maybe not the same
level of what you think about it.

156
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:39,349
Like we're not putting API keys in.

157
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:41,509
That's not something that's
really relevant to my team.

158
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,549
Most of the time, especially not with a I.

159
00:08:43,859 --> 00:08:47,919
But that other kind of data
is still a security risk.

160
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:50,719
You don't want that data getting out
where it could be used against you in

161
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:52,829
some sort of social engineering attack.

162
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:56,349
thinking about it like that, we're
constantly trying to think ahead of

163
00:08:56,349 --> 00:08:59,829
those kinds of risks and make sure that
we're not putting that data in place.

164
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:03,809
and that extends to really any AI tool,
which is difficult because every tool is

165
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,299
now have some, now has some AI component.

166
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,419
so making sure that those
are properly vetted.

167
00:09:08,729 --> 00:09:11,709
by whatever security team
you may have, which we have a

168
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:12,699
service that does that for us.

169
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:14,209
Great responses, Amber.

170
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:14,669
Thank you.

171
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,959
All right, now let's
hear from our sales team.

172
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,929
Would you please introduce
yourself and your role at Doppler?

173
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:21,339
Yeah, my name is Adam.

174
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:23,289
I'm the head of sales at Doppler.

175
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,549
We work on both pre sale and post
sale work with the customers.

176
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:30,579
So we help new prospects engage with
Doppler, evaluate if it makes sense for

177
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:33,869
their organization, and pending them
moving forward with us, we also maintain

178
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:36,639
the relationship long term, ensuring
that we help with their implementation

179
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,469
and their long term expansion with
us to drive revenue for the company.

180
00:09:39,969 --> 00:09:43,169
How is your team using AI and how
are you as an individual using AI?

181
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:44,549
pretty narrowly.

182
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:50,079
really we do our handful, a handful of
work with, with chat, GPT, ghost writing,

183
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,349
copy, and then adjusting it ourselves.

184
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:56,139
But for the sake of mass, mass writing,
or trying to write in bulk, we'll

185
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:59,279
usually use chat for a handful of
drafts and then iterate from there.

186
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,759
another place we use it
is in our note taker.

187
00:10:01,789 --> 00:10:04,719
We use a generative AI for
transcriptions, to easily write up

188
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:08,499
the, not only the summary, but also
the full transcription of the call.

189
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:12,489
And then use those recordings for faster
note taking to then post those notes

190
00:10:12,489 --> 00:10:14,019
internally for company visibility.

191
00:10:14,619 --> 00:10:18,079
And then personally, I use it on
a service called perplexity, which

192
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,429
is like chat GPT meets Google, to
allow for getting the information I'm

193
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:25,119
looking for and abstracting insights
faster through a search engine

194
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:27,129
in the interest of data security.

195
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:30,749
What rules do you think are most important
for your team when using generative AI?

196
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:34,109
Yeah, again, knowing that our team only
really works with customer data and not

197
00:10:34,109 --> 00:10:37,989
anything on the back end, it's really
like how we use, how we prompt rather.

198
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:41,219
So when I talk to my team about this
is our general practice of not being

199
00:10:41,219 --> 00:10:44,539
too specific to a customer when it
comes to like how we're ghostwriting

200
00:10:44,539 --> 00:10:45,729
a message or something like that.

201
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:48,689
so we're not going to use like first
names or emails or anything like that

202
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:52,049
when we're writing out the customer name,
we might use the company name, just to

203
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:55,429
make sure that the prompt that we're
using has the context of the business.

204
00:10:55,859 --> 00:10:57,799
But we won't, reference the
customer specifically, we

205
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,669
won't reference their email.

206
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:01,889
it's more so just to reference the
high level themes of their organization

207
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:04,679
and why Doppler might make sense for
them when it comes to, writing an

208
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:07,199
email or writing a draft with ChatGPT.

209
00:11:07,349 --> 00:11:09,559
The goal really is just to
keep it narrow in scope.

210
00:11:09,609 --> 00:11:13,599
like, when in doubt, we try and use it
for very specific niche things instead of,

211
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:15,489
having the default be to AI everything.

212
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:20,419
just with the sense of trying to keep
it easy to manage and also reduce

213
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:21,669
the potential vulnerability there.

214
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:23,389
Awesome responses, Adam.

215
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:24,319
Thank you for your time.

216
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:27,719
Now let's look into our engineering
team and see how they're using AI

217
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:29,089
and how they're doing it securely.

218
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:32,379
Would you please introduce
yourself and your role at Doppler?

219
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:34,219
I'm Nick Mnookian.

220
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:38,389
I'm the head of engineering at
Doppler and our team builds Doppler.

221
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:42,119
How is your team using AI and how
are you as an individual using AI?

222
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:47,999
Doppler is in a unique position of being
a very highly trusted security tool.

223
00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:53,099
So we are very risk averse when it
comes to any security related decisions.

224
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:58,509
So one of the first things that we do
when we're proposing any addition of new

225
00:11:58,539 --> 00:12:05,034
technology into our stack, generative AI
included, is Consulting our security team.

226
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:10,034
so when we engage them, they've worked
with a couple of other folks in the

227
00:12:10,034 --> 00:12:15,214
security space and have recommended
against using any generative AI for

228
00:12:15,264 --> 00:12:17,584
any application logic within Doppler.

229
00:12:17,944 --> 00:12:18,534
And.

230
00:12:19,034 --> 00:12:21,104
the engineering team has
mixed feelings on this.

231
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:25,704
this is a security recommendation
from our consultants, not a like,

232
00:12:26,424 --> 00:12:31,134
official, not an official ruling,
So that's the recommendation.

233
00:12:31,144 --> 00:12:33,804
We have our choice of whether
or not we want to comply.

234
00:12:34,244 --> 00:12:38,594
but they make some compelling arguments
around not fully understanding the

235
00:12:38,594 --> 00:12:41,784
code that you're deploying, because
there's a lot of ways a secret can leak.

236
00:12:42,274 --> 00:12:46,064
One of the ways that it can leak
very easily is by accidentally

237
00:12:46,074 --> 00:12:49,624
logging or otherwise disseminating
that secret from the application

238
00:12:49,624 --> 00:12:50,884
that is handling it, right?

239
00:12:50,884 --> 00:12:54,314
There is certainly one identity that
absolutely needs the secret, and

240
00:12:54,314 --> 00:12:57,854
that's the service that's running
your production applications.

241
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,754
So it's really easy to accidentally log.

242
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:05,389
A network request containing
the API key that you're using.

243
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:10,339
It's really easy to accidentally
log all of the configuration values,

244
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:15,529
which would include secrets when
your application starts up and when

245
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:21,269
you're writing code by hand, you are
thinking about what that code should

246
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,159
be doing before you are reviewing it
to make sure that it's correct, right?

247
00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:27,929
Like the process is, what do
I want the computer to do?

248
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:28,279
What do I want?

249
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:30,259
How do I want the service to behave?

250
00:13:30,654 --> 00:13:34,694
Then I write the code that matches that
generative AI kind of flips the script

251
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:39,284
there when you ask it to, start, to
write a service that handles network

252
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:40,734
applications with three endpoints.

253
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:44,474
For example, it's going to thumb
all that out for you and it

254
00:13:44,474 --> 00:13:49,374
determines how the service behaves,
you go back and correct it, right?

255
00:13:49,614 --> 00:13:54,834
So you can imagine if you were writing
a service and you were looking at, the

256
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:59,544
startup lines, for, The examples, you
could make a decision on, Oh, do I want to

257
00:14:00,044 --> 00:14:01,784
print out my environment variables or not?

258
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:05,284
And you might at that stage be like,
Oh gosh, like the environment variables

259
00:14:05,294 --> 00:14:07,054
that I'm using here are sensitive, right?

260
00:14:07,094 --> 00:14:08,604
I should not print those to console.

261
00:14:08,634 --> 00:14:11,594
Cause they'll end up in
my logs in AWS or GCP.

262
00:14:12,224 --> 00:14:16,544
But if you see the code, that's
Oh, it just says it's starting up.

263
00:14:16,544 --> 00:14:18,784
And then it prints out like
some configuration values.

264
00:14:19,084 --> 00:14:23,124
If you're not really thinking about what
that's doing, it's it seems correct.

265
00:14:23,204 --> 00:14:24,764
And that's like a lot
of what generated AI.

266
00:14:25,369 --> 00:14:30,569
I think is like Really bad at is the
things that it's, or I guess a risk of

267
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:36,529
generative AI, the things that it can't
really do still look correct somehow,

268
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:39,489
like they sound right, or they seem right.

269
00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:42,189
But once you start scratching at
it a little bit, you're like, wait

270
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:44,109
a minute, this isn't, this is bad.

271
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:44,829
This doesn't work.

272
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:46,279
Or that's not actually accurate.

273
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:46,509
It just.

274
00:14:46,884 --> 00:14:50,724
It just seems like it, it's
like, maybe not useful, but it's

275
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:51,824
really good at bullshitting.

276
00:14:51,914 --> 00:14:55,454
like that's, that's really, that's
what it really, truly excels at.

277
00:14:55,814 --> 00:14:58,284
Sounding right is like the
hallmark of generative AI.

278
00:14:58,284 --> 00:15:00,534
Looking right is the
hallmark of generative AI.

279
00:15:01,404 --> 00:15:06,274
So, for that reason, our team
does not use any generative

280
00:15:06,274 --> 00:15:07,544
AI for any application logic.

281
00:15:07,544 --> 00:15:10,564
This includes, our core backend
services that handle secrets.

282
00:15:10,754 --> 00:15:15,194
It includes, any of the like
intermediary layers, like our API routes.

283
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:19,174
and it also includes like our
front end code because those things

284
00:15:19,204 --> 00:15:20,894
are actually handling secrets.

285
00:15:20,894 --> 00:15:25,204
When you type a secret into the Doppler
UI, that's probably one of the most.

286
00:15:26,004 --> 00:15:30,174
sensitive spots where we could
accidentally leak a value, out of

287
00:15:30,184 --> 00:15:33,374
the Dom because it's so easy to make
network requests from that environment.

288
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:37,084
So we do not use it at all
in any application logic.

289
00:15:37,914 --> 00:15:40,704
and I think for that reason, our
team gets less value out of it than

290
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:42,504
maybe other engineering orgs would.

291
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:47,964
The places where we do use it
occasionally is for writing tests,

292
00:15:48,064 --> 00:15:49,344
boilerplate, things like that.

293
00:15:49,714 --> 00:15:50,244
I do.

294
00:15:50,764 --> 00:15:52,204
Use it quite frequently personally.

295
00:15:52,204 --> 00:15:59,044
I think my team does as well, for
writing like one off code scripts.

296
00:15:59,404 --> 00:16:03,214
Like I really don't like writing bash and
I don't know how many people really do.

297
00:16:03,424 --> 00:16:06,324
but it's pretty painful to like,
look up the syntax for all the

298
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:07,554
specific things you need to do.

299
00:16:07,564 --> 00:16:08,814
Like I wrote a script the other day.

300
00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:12,499
That was querying a DNS
record on 15 domains.

301
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:17,299
And I was like, I want the script to
take in, a file, read it line by line.

302
00:16:17,489 --> 00:16:21,489
I'm like, I know it's like an IFS
separator thing I was supposed to do.

303
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:25,479
It was so much easier to just write,
a prompt that was like, write me

304
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:26,609
a script that does this thing.

305
00:16:26,979 --> 00:16:28,639
And then it writes,
it's very good at that.

306
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,409
And it's also really easy to review
that code and make sure that it's

307
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:32,909
doing what you expect it to do.

308
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:36,259
Because it's usually for
very simple applications.

309
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:37,789
and it's really good at that.

310
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:41,289
And then if you know the language, you can
make little adjustments and tune it up.

311
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:45,009
In the interest of data security, what
rules do you think are most important

312
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:47,139
for your team when using generative AI?

313
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:50,549
I think, somewhat obviously
the number one thing is.

314
00:16:51,384 --> 00:16:54,914
Just really make sure that the code is
doing what you expect it to be doing.

315
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:57,164
it's really easier said than done.

316
00:16:57,264 --> 00:17:01,384
be thoughtful around what patterns
you're introducing, like there are

317
00:17:01,404 --> 00:17:05,004
practical security implications to
this, make sure the code isn't logging

318
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:08,664
secrets someplace, or make sure that
it isn't repeating a pattern that

319
00:17:08,664 --> 00:17:10,124
actually has a vulnerability, right?

320
00:17:10,124 --> 00:17:13,834
Something that it found on stack overflow
or has been done over and is problematic.

321
00:17:14,214 --> 00:17:14,234
Yeah.

322
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:14,264
Yeah.

323
00:17:14,264 --> 00:17:14,294
Yeah.

324
00:17:14,704 --> 00:17:15,644
Easier said than done.

325
00:17:15,694 --> 00:17:20,704
there are also practical, non security
related, but like performance things.

326
00:17:20,714 --> 00:17:24,534
There, there might be a very common way
to implement something that has less than

327
00:17:24,534 --> 00:17:26,504
favorable performance characteristics.

328
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:29,844
And you, it's something that you might've
known if you were writing the code,

329
00:17:29,844 --> 00:17:32,294
you would have said, Oh, wow, this is
actually a lot of iterations over this

330
00:17:32,294 --> 00:17:36,194
array, but if you're just accepting
it and checking it for correctness,

331
00:17:36,194 --> 00:17:38,839
it's Then, yeah, it looks pretty good.

332
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:39,579
It works.

333
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:40,779
It, all the tests pass.

334
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:46,319
So I think just being very thoughtful
around the uses of generative AI in your

335
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,119
application logic, making sure that it
behaves how you expect it to behave in

336
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:53,049
addition to, is it correct behavior?

337
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:56,909
Also be asking, how
could this be exploited?

338
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:00,179
really put the code through
the ringer like you would for

339
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:01,709
a new developer on your team.

340
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,739
So as you can see, different departments
use generative AI in different

341
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:09,519
ways, but a lot of their security
concerns are similar or the same.

342
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:13,029
Considering this, it's important to
make sure that you have a company

343
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:16,879
wide AI policy that reflects the
needs of your organization at a level

344
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:18,139
that's most appropriate for you.

345
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,269
I hope you found this presentation
helpful and got some insights

346
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:24,729
into things you should think about
regarding AI and data security.
