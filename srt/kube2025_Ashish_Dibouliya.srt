1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,100
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:06,949
I'm Ashish Lia, managing director and
principal Data architect at Webster

3
00:00:06,949 --> 00:00:11,860
Bank, where I lead large scale data
and AI initiatives across regulatory

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,510
reporting, enterprise data platform,
and intelligent financial system.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,050
I'm delighted to be here to share
insight on AI data governance for

6
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,570
scalable compliance in modern banking.

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,549
At con 42 Cube native 2025 conference.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,720
So AI is no longer an
experiment in banking.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,030
It's a mission critical
from fraud detection to risk

10
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,830
assessment to customer engagement.

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,560
AI is enabling in every layer of
the modern financial institute.

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,990
But with this power comes a set of
governance challenges that we must

13
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,620
address quick glimpse of the agenda.

14
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,080
We will begin with the context
and introduction, why modern

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,060
governance has become imperative.

16
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,805
Then I'll walk you through
the evaluation of ai.

17
00:01:01,565 --> 00:01:05,585
Next we'll mine the limitation of
the traditional governance model.

18
00:01:06,164 --> 00:01:09,684
From there, I will introduce to
unified AI data governance framework.

19
00:01:09,794 --> 00:01:13,584
And we'll explore compliance and
regulatory alignment, followed

20
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:16,444
by a real world case studies.

21
00:01:16,804 --> 00:01:21,094
And then we'll close with the future
roadmap and some key take of this.

22
00:01:21,594 --> 00:01:24,754
So first part of the session,
introduction and context.

23
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,389
Banking operates in one of the most
banking operations is one of the most

24
00:01:30,389 --> 00:01:32,939
regulated environment in the world today.

25
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:37,479
Compliance failure don't just
bring financial penalties.

26
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,849
Sometimes it is billions.

27
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:41,815
They also damage the reputation.

28
00:01:42,315 --> 00:01:47,975
And at the same time, bank face
intense pressure to innovate rapidly

29
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:52,955
deploying AI to meet the customer and
market demands traditional framework

30
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:54,965
designed for static data warehouse.

31
00:01:55,914 --> 00:01:56,975
And predictable.

32
00:01:57,005 --> 00:02:04,005
ETL simply cannot handle the complexity
and the dynami dynamism of AI system.

33
00:02:04,695 --> 00:02:08,384
So this dual pressure one,
the compliance on one side.

34
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:13,110
And then innovation on the other
side make it essential to rethink

35
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,150
the whole governance process.

36
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,745
Jumping onto the next segment of of
our discussion that is AI evaluation

37
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:22,275
and containerization in the banking.

38
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:28,884
So over the last decade AI in banking
has grown from a small, isolated pillar.

39
00:02:29,644 --> 00:02:33,084
Into an enterprise scale
system that basically enables

40
00:02:33,084 --> 00:02:34,644
a core banking operations.

41
00:02:35,314 --> 00:02:36,844
Think about a fraud detection model.

42
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:42,464
They take input from dozens of data
sources, analyze them in milliseconds,

43
00:02:42,464 --> 00:02:45,294
and continue to learn in the real time.

44
00:02:45,894 --> 00:02:50,364
So AI is no longer a tool, it
is a backbone of the modern

45
00:02:50,364 --> 00:02:52,314
banking infrastructure nowadays.

46
00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:57,434
Talking about the containerization
revolution to support this

47
00:02:57,434 --> 00:03:02,464
scale bank has embraced the
centralization or containerization.

48
00:03:03,404 --> 00:03:09,414
Kubernetes enable AI workload to run with
incredible flexibility deploying across

49
00:03:09,414 --> 00:03:15,944
the hybrid cloud scaling dynamically
and updating seamlessly through

50
00:03:16,004 --> 00:03:19,334
blue screen or cannery deployments.

51
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:21,844
But here is the trade off.

52
00:03:21,904 --> 00:03:27,484
While the containers bring agility,
they also bring complexity.

53
00:03:27,984 --> 00:03:34,164
The complexity of workload, dynamic
service meshes distributed clusters,

54
00:03:34,344 --> 00:03:40,174
traditional monitoring and governance
tool struggle to keep up with all of this.

55
00:03:41,014 --> 00:03:44,554
And that's where the governance
challenge become more

56
00:03:44,554 --> 00:03:45,844
prominent or deepens basically.

57
00:03:46,344 --> 00:03:49,674
Quickly talking about the challenges
with the traditional governance model.

58
00:03:50,174 --> 00:03:55,044
Traditional governance model
falls short in four key ways.

59
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:58,824
If you just broadly look at these
four segments, it is going to

60
00:03:58,824 --> 00:04:02,844
cover the challenges with the
traditional governance model.

61
00:04:02,934 --> 00:04:04,674
The first one is the metadata management.

62
00:04:05,664 --> 00:04:10,774
So AI produces massive amount
of constant changing metadata.

63
00:04:11,764 --> 00:04:13,684
Then the second is lineage tracking.

64
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:20,944
Understanding where each feature
of the model input comes from

65
00:04:21,064 --> 00:04:23,764
is nearly impossible at a scale.

66
00:04:24,274 --> 00:04:26,104
Third, real time compliance.

67
00:04:26,524 --> 00:04:33,364
So regulators demand continuous
monitoring of biased drift and quality.

68
00:04:34,054 --> 00:04:36,824
And fourth is regulatory comp complexity.

69
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:42,364
Laws now demand explainable
fair and bias-free ai.

70
00:04:43,244 --> 00:04:48,244
These are not just check boxes,
they are the continuous obligation.

71
00:04:48,694 --> 00:04:52,554
As of now, just moving on to the
next segment of discussion that is

72
00:04:52,554 --> 00:04:55,354
unified AI data governance framework.

73
00:04:55,854 --> 00:04:58,534
So this is where new approach is required.

74
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:04,684
The unified AI data governance
framework is built for cloud native

75
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:05,904
containerized infrastructure.

76
00:05:06,864 --> 00:05:13,744
It deploys governance as microservice that
is scaled dynamically, deeply integrated

77
00:05:13,744 --> 00:05:15,439
with the Kubernetes orchestration.

78
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:23,109
And it uses a seamless metadata
architecture, which enable the capturing

79
00:05:23,109 --> 00:05:25,389
and analysis of events in real time.

80
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:31,699
Ensuring governance isn't lagging
behind ai but operates alongside it.

81
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,629
The framework has three
critical components.

82
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:38,289
The first one is the metadata
orchestration engine.

83
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:44,839
The central nervous system
collecting the basically the managing

84
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,439
collection of managing thousands
of metadata events per second.

85
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:55,139
A second part is the intelligent lineage
tracker using the graph algorithm and

86
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:59,889
instrumentation to trace dependencies
across our distributed AI system.

87
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:02,109
Third one, the real time.

88
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:09,129
Compliance monitor monitoring constantly
evolving AI decision against internal

89
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:11,499
politics and regulatory requirement.

90
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:18,529
Together these components make governance
containers automated and intelligent.

91
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:23,339
Quickly jumping on to the next,
topic, which is to make this work.

92
00:06:23,369 --> 00:06:27,749
Metadata management itself
must be high performance.

93
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,179
We use distributed storage.

94
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:37,469
So relational and graph databases
optimizes optimize for different queries.

95
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:46,399
Frequently access data is kept in memory
for sub million second response time.

96
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:52,009
Then a specialized index support,
time-based graph and full text queries.

97
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:58,209
And obviously metadata federation
enable queries across multiple source

98
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:04,119
without centralizing everything,
reduces reducing the cost and latency.

99
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:04,599
Tendency

100
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:06,469
Automation is crucial.

101
00:07:07,244 --> 00:07:13,624
Draft the drift detection monitoring
monitors for shifts in the data concept

102
00:07:13,654 --> 00:07:18,254
and performance biased detection
ensures basically the fairness across

103
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:20,164
demographic demographic groups.

104
00:07:20,164 --> 00:07:22,224
And it is, it protects attributes.

105
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:29,079
And anomaly detection powered by
unsupervised machine learning spot

106
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,829
spots, unusual behavior in model of data.

107
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:37,319
Or maybe in other words,
governance is no longer passive.

108
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,409
It is active, intelligent,
and evolving alongside ai.

109
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:45,099
Security is built in from ground up.

110
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:52,219
In this case, we apply defense in depth
in depth integrating with the enterprise.

111
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:53,599
IAM system.

112
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,554
Access isn't just role based.

113
00:07:56,554 --> 00:08:01,004
It is attribute based allowing
for the fine grained permission.

114
00:08:01,504 --> 00:08:08,054
Every governance operation is no longer
with full context and all metadata

115
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:14,524
is protected through end-to-end
encryption with support for field

116
00:08:14,524 --> 00:08:16,894
level encryption and tokenization.

117
00:08:17,794 --> 00:08:23,784
This result compliance and security
by design not as afterthought.

118
00:08:24,284 --> 00:08:27,624
Jumping onto the next segment of
the discussion, which is compliance

119
00:08:27,654 --> 00:08:32,604
and regulatory alignment, which is a
crucial part of the whole equation.

120
00:08:33,594 --> 00:08:39,674
The framework directly aligns with
the major regulations for GDPR.

121
00:08:40,174 --> 00:08:44,109
It supports consent tracking
right management and.

122
00:08:44,869 --> 00:08:47,230
The right to be forgotten.

123
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:56,320
Identifying every model trained on a
person's data for CCPA it automates

124
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:02,860
consumer right consumer rights require
and data sharing, tracking for basal

125
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:08,500
three, it supports risk modeling,
validation, tracking, and stress testing.

126
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,720
And it anticipates the EU AI
Act, which is classifying the AI

127
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,280
system by risk label and applying
the right governance controls.

128
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,860
This isn't reactive com compliance.

129
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:28,720
It is in a nutshell all proactive
compliance enforcement or alignment.

130
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,420
Just quickly looking at some
of the cases, studies, roadmap,

131
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,800
and maybe the conclusion.

132
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,740
So let's look at some real world example.

133
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,460
Global tier one bank rolled.

134
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,180
This out in phases, beginning
with the fraud detection, credit

135
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:51,110
risk, and regulatory reporting,
the results were transformative.

136
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:59,420
68% faster time to market for new AI
model, 70%, 75% reduction in the audit

137
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:05,170
preparation time through automated
reporting and 42% fewer risk events.

138
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,050
And thanks to early detection.

139
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,900
This proves that governance
does not slow innovation.

140
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:18,319
It actually accelerates it and keeps
everybody in the organization safe

141
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:23,129
looking at the future roadmap and
some of the emerging technologies,

142
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:28,479
which kind of addresses some of the
need when it comes to data governance.

143
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:34,039
So the roadmap looks ahead
to emerging technology.

144
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:39,019
Serverless compliance monitoring
functions, the trigger in the real

145
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:46,719
time as even dockers centralization or
containerization, policy enforcement.

146
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,610
Basically deploy directly.

147
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,340
So policies are deployed
directly alongside workload,

148
00:10:54,030 --> 00:11:01,290
then advance explainability human
readable inside in AI decisions.

149
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:05,450
Coming next is a federated governance,
which is critical for multi-cloud,

150
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,355
multi organization ecosystem.

151
00:11:08,095 --> 00:11:10,950
And again, this isn't just
about today's compliance.

152
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:16,165
It is in a nutshell about
preparing for tomorrow's AI

153
00:11:16,165 --> 00:11:18,655
system or AI ecosystem as well.

154
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:25,805
To wrap up, AI governance is both
necessity and competitive advantage.

155
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:32,835
The unified AI governance framework shows
that bank can stay compliant, secure, and

156
00:11:32,835 --> 00:11:36,285
resilient, while still innovating rapidly.

157
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,720
But success requires more than technology.

158
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:45,420
It needs organization commitment,
investment in skills and alignment

159
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:51,050
between governance and business
strategies bank that embraces this

160
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:54,470
balance will lead in the age of ai.

161
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,585
With that, I'll wrap up my session.

162
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,545
Thank you for your time and attention.

163
00:11:59,045 --> 00:12:03,325
And I'll be happy to take
any question which might be

164
00:12:03,685 --> 00:12:05,085
appropriate for the discussion.

165
00:12:05,585 --> 00:12:06,070
Thank you so much.

166
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:06,690
I.
