00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:01,680
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,520
Welcome to Con 42 Machine Learning 2025.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:07,950
My name is Bala.

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,520
Kris, thank you for joining me today.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,090
We all know that AI is the future,
but the fact is AI is already here.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,735
It is in the apps we use and the products
we buy and the companies we work for.

7
00:00:24,595 --> 00:00:26,055
Let me tell you a big story.

8
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:29,055
There was a delivery
company with a big problem.

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,250
The packages were always late.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,490
Customers were complaining
about the late deliveries.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,340
Then they tried something different.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,760
They used AI to help drivers
choose the best routes.

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,920
The system looked at traffic,
weather, and distances and

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,510
gave the real time suggestions.

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,620
After a few weeks, the
delivery times are improved and

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,210
customer satisfaction went up.

17
00:00:55,935 --> 00:00:57,075
Is the power of ai.

18
00:00:57,335 --> 00:00:59,700
It is simple, helpful, and effective.

19
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,630
Today, AI helps with so many tasks,
stopping frauds in the bank, helping

20
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,700
doctors find diseases faster, and
reading job resumes and suggesting

21
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,000
the best candidates and showing your
ads that match your interests, even

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,130
helping students learn better on online.

23
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,910
So what are we going to cover today?

24
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:30,179
I will show you how fast AI is
going and what kind of systems

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,310
companies are building examples
from real time industries like hr,

26
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,080
finance and manufacturing, and what
problems businesses face with ai.

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,850
And finally, where this is
all going next, let's begin.

28
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:46,299
Yeah.

29
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,780
Let's talk about the area
market is going fast.

30
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,670
A is just not a cool tool anymore.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,179
It is becoming part of how
businesses run every day.

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,090
In 2019, the global as software
market was about $28 billion.

33
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,880
By 2027, it is expected
to reach $315 billion.

34
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,460
That is more than 10 times bigger.

35
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,780
In less than 10 years.

36
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:16,180
What is driving this growth?

37
00:02:16,915 --> 00:02:18,835
Let's talk some of that scenarios.

38
00:02:19,614 --> 00:02:26,635
Companies want faster decisions and they
want to save time and money, and they want

39
00:02:26,695 --> 00:02:29,065
better experiences for their customers.

40
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:31,045
Let's take one example.

41
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:32,935
Okay.

42
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:35,935
Online store had thousands
of product reviews.

43
00:02:36,415 --> 00:02:41,005
Customers were saying all kinds of
things, like some good and some bad.

44
00:02:41,845 --> 00:02:45,715
The companies use IA to read
those reviews and understand.

45
00:02:46,105 --> 00:02:48,355
What customer liked or did not.

46
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:51,985
Based on that they
improved their products.

47
00:02:52,525 --> 00:02:57,535
This leads to fewer returns and happy
yet buyers and companies use it.

48
00:02:57,895 --> 00:03:00,295
AI to remove the checkout lines in stores.

49
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:02,935
This is one of the, another example.

50
00:03:03,595 --> 00:03:09,085
Cameras and sensors track what people
picked up and charged them automatically.

51
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:14,850
No cashiers, no lines, just
a code that is AI in action.

52
00:03:15,865 --> 00:03:20,275
Let's now see how these companies
build such smart systems.

53
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:22,535
Let's go to the next slide.

54
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:26,135
This is intelligent
automation architecture.

55
00:03:27,815 --> 00:03:29,285
AI does not work alone.

56
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:36,125
It needs a system behind it, just like a
car needs an engine, fuel and a driver.

57
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:38,225
Here is how it is.

58
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:40,805
Usually looks data ingestion.

59
00:03:41,705 --> 00:03:45,485
This is where we collect the
information from different types of

60
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:54,245
sources like websites, sensors, forms,
or anything, processing a modules.

61
00:03:54,305 --> 00:04:00,815
Use this data to find patterns or make
predict predictions and analytics.

62
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:07,145
We turn the results into charts,
scores, or LX integration.

63
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:13,369
We send these results to other systems
like an app or dashboards presentation.

64
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:18,320
People see the outcome like a warning,
a recommendation, or a report.

65
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,600
A bank, for example, might check every
transaction with an A fraud system.

66
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,370
If something looks strange,
the system flags it immediately

67
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,659
and alerts the analyst.

68
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,510
This is a smart system in action.

69
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,270
Fast, secure, and connected.

70
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,039
Let's look how.

71
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,230
This helps in HR and finance.

72
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:39,710
Next.

73
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,060
Now let's go to the next slide.

74
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:49,100
Hr, analyticals and Financial
Intelligence Systems.

75
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,140
We can call it as AI in HR and finance.

76
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,420
In human resources.

77
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,330
HR companies are afraid with regimes.

78
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,970
Reading them all take days.

79
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,470
Now ai, AI tools can scan
regimes and pick out the skills.

80
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,694
Match people to the
right job within minutes.

81
00:05:10,684 --> 00:05:16,054
They also check for bias and
try to making hiring fair.

82
00:05:16,835 --> 00:05:20,405
One company went from 30 days
hiring cycle to just eight days.

83
00:05:20,615 --> 00:05:28,355
Witha support in finance, AI helps in
different factors, trade, market risk,

84
00:05:28,835 --> 00:05:34,505
and sports, suspicious payments, and rate
long contracts and highlight the key tabs.

85
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:40,549
One bank is an AA model to
read the compliance documents.

86
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,770
It's used to take three weeks for a
team, but the AA is finishing just

87
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,049
two days with the high accuracy.

88
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:54,559
So whether it is about hiring the best
people or managing the money better,

89
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,890
AA is becoming a trusted assistance.

90
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,679
Now let's talk about the decision making.

91
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,559
What happens when AI helps us decide?

92
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:09,270
And now let's talk about the
decision support system evolution.

93
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,450
AI is becoming more than a helper.

94
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,570
It is becoming a decision partner.

95
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:22,390
This is called a decision
intelligence, and it's growing fast.

96
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,580
In 2022, the market was
about 11 billion by 2030.

97
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:30,984
It may reach up to 44 billion.

98
00:06:31,884 --> 00:06:37,585
Let's say you work in a hospital,
NAA system can look at the symptoms,

99
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,405
test results, and medical history.

100
00:06:41,364 --> 00:06:44,395
They then suggest possible
diagnosis or treatments.

101
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:50,395
Doctors still make the final call, but
they have the most support and information

102
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:53,020
which they extracted from the aa.

103
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,734
Or if you talk about in.

104
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:04,030
A might tell the managers which products
are running low and when to restock.

105
00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:06,665
This decision happens in real time.

106
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:13,719
For example, a good decision system needs
rules like what are all the guidance we

107
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:21,219
have to follow and data like the history
or the live updates and the AM models to

108
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:25,659
analyze and the feedback from the humans.

109
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:31,705
A financial form use AI to
rebalance risky investments.

110
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:37,585
They combine news reports, market
signals, and the past behaviors.

111
00:07:38,305 --> 00:07:41,095
This is reduced, the risk loses by 25%.

112
00:07:42,415 --> 00:07:46,255
Let's move on and see how
these systems all connect using

113
00:07:46,255 --> 00:07:47,660
the real time integrations.

114
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,735
Now let's talk about the next slide.

115
00:07:50,885 --> 00:07:53,975
Integration patterns in modern AI systems.

116
00:07:55,415 --> 00:08:01,145
Now that we have seen how AA helps
with decision making, let's talk

117
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:03,065
about how the systems are connected.

118
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,005
AA does not work by itself.

119
00:08:06,005 --> 00:08:10,475
It takes to the, it talks to
the other systems and you chase

120
00:08:10,475 --> 00:08:14,195
the data and responds to the
events happening in a real time.

121
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,470
This is where the integration comes in

122
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,460
to think of a smart home.

123
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,860
The light turns on when you walk in.

124
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,890
The thermostat adjusts when you leave.

125
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,040
All the individuals are
talking to each other.

126
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,430
A company works at the same way.

127
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,570
Here are some ways AI is integrated,
real time data streaming.

128
00:08:42,275 --> 00:08:47,585
Tools like Kafka, or he even helps,
sends live data to the AI models.

129
00:08:48,155 --> 00:08:51,785
This helps in fraud detection
or monitoring missions.

130
00:08:52,715 --> 00:08:57,275
Even driven systems like their
response when something happens.

131
00:08:58,115 --> 00:09:02,545
For example, when a user logs into the
system checks for a risk and triggers a

132
00:09:02,545 --> 00:09:05,935
security scan and streaming analytics.

133
00:09:06,865 --> 00:09:11,005
Instead of waiting for reports,
a HX data as it arrives.

134
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:16,195
This is used in stock trading,
weather alerts, and even food

135
00:09:16,195 --> 00:09:19,585
delivery Timings, hi hybrid setups.

136
00:09:20,155 --> 00:09:24,205
Some models runs in real time,
others updates overnight.

137
00:09:24,835 --> 00:09:27,415
This keeps the systems
faster and accurate.

138
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:32,395
A quick example for this scenario,
a flight company checks the

139
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:34,045
engine data during the flights.

140
00:09:35,204 --> 00:09:38,589
There is a strange, significant,
the AA alerts the ground team

141
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,540
before the plane even lands.

142
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,010
That is how powerful a
the realtime AI can be.

143
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:51,130
Before we go to the next slide,
let's explore F1 and usual

144
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,920
part of aa, which is chat bots.

145
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:57,160
We have seen them on websites now.

146
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,740
We will look at how they actually work.

147
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,250
Now let's talk about enterprise
chatbot architecture.

148
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:10,490
Chatbots have become our first line
of communication with many businesses.

149
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:17,120
When you ask a question on a
website and a bot replies, it is

150
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,280
more than just pre-written answers.

151
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,440
It is a whole system working together.

152
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,570
Let's see how it is built.

153
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,330
The user interface.

154
00:10:27,305 --> 00:10:29,465
This is where you type your questions.

155
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:37,445
It could be a website, a
WhatsApp, or a even voice, and

156
00:10:37,505 --> 00:10:39,095
it understands the languages.

157
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:40,895
NLU, we call it as NLU.

158
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:47,045
The AI reads your cushion and
figures out what you mean, and the

159
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:48,665
next one is the dialogue manager.

160
00:10:49,685 --> 00:10:53,640
It keeps the conversations going and
remembers what you have said earlier.

161
00:10:55,295 --> 00:10:56,555
The backend connections.

162
00:10:56,735 --> 00:11:01,115
This is where it takes to the
company systems like checking your

163
00:11:01,115 --> 00:11:03,455
balances or booking an appointment.

164
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:06,455
And the next one is security and tracking.

165
00:11:07,205 --> 00:11:09,395
Everything is logged and kept safe.

166
00:11:10,565 --> 00:11:15,365
Chatbots are used in different
industries like hr. Asking for

167
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:21,305
a leave are checking the salary
informations and it supports resetting

168
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,855
the passwords, opening the tickets.

169
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:29,285
In healthcare, booking the appointments
with the providers, sending the

170
00:11:29,285 --> 00:11:34,865
remind reminders about your future
appointments and retail checking

171
00:11:34,865 --> 00:11:37,145
orders are giving the recommendations.

172
00:11:37,955 --> 00:11:40,295
Example, a quick example here.

173
00:11:41,165 --> 00:11:44,345
A telecom company launched a
chart board in four languages.

174
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:48,425
It handles 68% of customer requests.

175
00:11:48,905 --> 00:11:51,905
Without a human, it save a lot of time.

176
00:11:52,685 --> 00:11:58,115
And reduce the pressure on the supporting
team and give users a faster experience.

177
00:11:58,655 --> 00:12:04,325
Let's see what makes the systems hard to
manage and how businesses are solving it.

178
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:08,175
And now let's talk about the
technical challenges in enterprise.

179
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:08,410
Aa

180
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:17,115
a AI sounds amazing and it is, but it
also brings some serious challenges,

181
00:12:17,205 --> 00:12:18,975
especially in big organizations.

182
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:26,145
Let's talk about some of the top issues
we are seeing with AA data privacy.

183
00:12:27,225 --> 00:12:29,295
AA systems often use personal data.

184
00:12:30,194 --> 00:12:31,395
It must be protected.

185
00:12:32,295 --> 00:12:39,194
Rules like GDPR and HIPAA are very
strict about this and model rate.

186
00:12:39,824 --> 00:12:44,985
Over time, the world changes multiple
last month may not work today.

187
00:12:45,495 --> 00:12:48,615
AI needs to be adjusted for this one.

188
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:55,949
Scaling problems when 10 users
becomes 10,000 systems must be fast,

189
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,060
reliable, unstable, and bias in models.

190
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,209
The training data has bias.

191
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,310
AI may give unfair results.

192
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:10,290
We must test and monitor
carefully and human review.

193
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,010
Sometimes a should not
make the final call.

194
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,770
Human should step in for
complex absence to issues.

195
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:22,199
For example, a financial company
tested a new model for approving

196
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:24,540
the loans in shadow mode.

197
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:30,210
They decide it was giving the lowest
scores for the recent immigrants, and

198
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:34,920
they passed it and fix the issue and
launch it later with better rules.

199
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,865
And coming up, we talk
about the infrastructure.

200
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:44,160
How do we manage all the data
models and try in a smart way.

201
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,600
Now let's talk about the next slide.

202
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,080
AI fracture and resource management.

203
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,420
Behind every smart AA system,
there is a powerful setup.

204
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,060
AI needs data pipelines, model
training and deployment tools,

205
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,040
and people who monitors it all.

206
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,240
Let's look at the key
bots automated pipelines.

207
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,060
Example, tools like Airflow
and Q Flow help more data and

208
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,560
trying the models regularly.

209
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,600
CSCD for aa.

210
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:24,030
Just like software get updates,
AA models also need to update it.

211
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,720
The essentials, they
stay accurate and safe.

212
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:36,720
A, some AA runs on small devices
like phones, cameras, or even drones.

213
00:14:37,215 --> 00:14:41,235
These models are smaller
and faster future stores.

214
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:48,345
This holds common data pieces that
model uses like location, age, or

215
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,925
last purchase, human in the loop.

216
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:53,685
In some cases, people check or adjust.

217
00:14:53,715 --> 00:14:57,675
What I suggest, this helps
with training and trust.

218
00:14:58,695 --> 00:15:04,185
A quick example for this scenario, a drone
company uses small models and the drone

219
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:06,555
itself to detect cracks in the pipelines.

220
00:15:06,585 --> 00:15:10,455
It work without needing to
send the data to the cloud,

221
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:12,465
and it saves the cost and time.

222
00:15:13,425 --> 00:15:15,165
Let's no talk about the future.

223
00:15:15,885 --> 00:15:19,065
What is coming next in the
AA and why it is matters.

224
00:15:20,065 --> 00:15:24,625
Now let's talk about the future
directions, RIML, and expandable a.

225
00:15:27,085 --> 00:15:29,935
The two big things are
shaping the future of the aa.

226
00:15:30,445 --> 00:15:31,245
One is Rml.

227
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:33,735
We call it as automation learning.

228
00:15:34,665 --> 00:15:37,485
This is a AI that builds other ai.

229
00:15:37,995 --> 00:15:43,995
It helps teams quickly test and pick the
best model, even if there are no experts

230
00:15:44,535 --> 00:15:47,235
and expandable ai, we call it as XA.

231
00:15:47,835 --> 00:15:50,595
This helps us understand
why a AI made a decision.

232
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:56,625
It is very important in banking,
healthcare, and loss examples.

233
00:15:57,285 --> 00:16:01,130
A bank is not to create
a credit approval model.

234
00:16:02,145 --> 00:16:08,295
Then it used explainability tool
like shop to show customers why

235
00:16:08,295 --> 00:16:09,855
they were approved or denied.

236
00:16:10,545 --> 00:16:13,545
It builds trust and reduce complaints.

237
00:16:14,355 --> 00:16:21,195
This tool get together Auto ML and
expandable AI makes a faster to

238
00:16:21,195 --> 00:16:24,135
build and easier to trust and know.

239
00:16:24,135 --> 00:16:25,245
Let's wrap up it.

240
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,825
Let's bring all it together.

241
00:16:28,825 --> 00:16:33,355
Now let's coming to the
conclusion, let's recap everything

242
00:16:33,355 --> 00:16:34,795
we have talked about so far.

243
00:16:35,785 --> 00:16:40,255
AI is changing how companies work
from decisions to automation,

244
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:46,375
and it is going fast and it is
being used in all industries.

245
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:51,835
Smart systems need good design,
integration and monitoring.

246
00:16:53,035 --> 00:16:54,445
We must think about privacy.

247
00:16:54,939 --> 00:17:01,120
Fairness and keeping humans
involved and the future easier.

248
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:05,409
A without IM, L and more
trust with expandability.

249
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:07,839
And one final thought.

250
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:13,464
A will not replace people,
but people will, who uses a

251
00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:15,464
will replace those who don't.

252
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,150
And thank you all for your time.

253
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:20,349
It's Bill aa.

254
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:25,599
That is not only smart, but
also useful, fair and trusted.

255
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:29,389
So thank you all so much for
being part of this session.

256
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:33,289
AI is not just a technology.

257
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:38,539
It is a way to solve the real
problems, make better decisions and

258
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:40,669
support people in their everyday work.

259
00:17:41,569 --> 00:17:44,330
As we move forward, it will say systems.

260
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:50,510
They are smart, yes, but also
simple, safe, and helpful.

261
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:54,230
If you would like to connect,
ask questions, and continue
