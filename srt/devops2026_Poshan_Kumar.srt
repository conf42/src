00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
Speaker 28: Hello all under
the track of sustainability.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,230
Today I'll be discussing generative
AI workflows for climate risk

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,700
modeling in food systems.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,479
2024 was likely the first calendar
year recorded 1.5 degrees ingrade

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:19,670
above the pre industrial baseline
with cascading extremes affecting

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,229
agriculture and logistics.

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,329
This is now the operational
backdrop for our DevOps decision.

8
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:31,120
Today I'll show how to embed, generate
new climate intelligence into c cd and

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:36,319
so that the risk modeling downscaling and
stakeholder briefings, reliable software.

10
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:39,879
I'm Phan a data a, an analytics architect.

11
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:45,864
Working at the intersection of enterprise
platform and climate resilience focus

12
00:00:45,864 --> 00:00:52,379
today from to maintainable systems
ml, that is DevOps m the challenge.

13
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:57,349
Climate volatility and that
threatens food systems, food

14
00:00:57,769 --> 00:00:59,899
insecurity remains stubbornly high.

15
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:00,739
Sophie

16
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:01,569
Hunger.

17
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:06,750
2.3 billion experienced, moderate,
or severe food insecurity.

18
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,070
Affordability of healthy dates
remains a critical constraint.

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,460
2024 shattered climate shows that
compoundings floods and heat stress.

20
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:20,880
That heat production storage transport.

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,280
WO emphasizes early warning on climate
services as vital for protection.

22
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:32,400
The engineering takeaway is that
our data ML systems must anticipate

23
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:37,860
extremes, quantify uncertainty,
and continuously adapt them.

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,850
The convergence opportunity to start with
climate data availability, year five.

25
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:51,170
Provides howly globally analysis
since 1940 at around 31 kilometer

26
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,750
with uncertainty estimates.

27
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,550
A near realtime updates ideal for
historical baseline and features.

28
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:05,745
Sentinel two offers 10 to 20
multi-spectral L surface reflectance

29
00:02:05,745 --> 00:02:11,425
with frequent revisit greater for
vegetation stress signal on soil moisture.

30
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:18,345
CIP six scenarios define futures
for emissions, socioeconomics for

31
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:19,965
forward looking stress testing.

32
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:26,015
The second, the generative and
ML weather climate graph CAST GNN

33
00:02:26,195 --> 00:02:28,595

41
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,760
For precipitation and near surface
fields critical for form level risk.

42
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,359
Finally, The DevOps maturity.

43
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,530
The gits ization and policy as a code.

44
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,359
Let's treat models like software
with tests, rollouts, and rollbacks.

45
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:15,359
We all use I workflows for
Q Flow case of so being said

46
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:17,430
