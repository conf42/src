1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,440
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,820
Welcome to conference 42,
machine Learning 2025.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:11,130
My name is Baba PRIs ela and I
work as a staff technical program

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,810
manager at Walmart, where I
primarily lead infrastructure,

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,910
engineering and DevOps teams.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,060
So today I am honored to
speak to you regarding.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,720
Architecting intelligent platforms,
how machine learning is reshaping

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,150
modern enterprise infrastructure.

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:40,110
How machine learning is transforming
cloud platforms into intelligent systems

10
00:00:40,265 --> 00:00:42,755
that deliver measurable business value.

11
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:45,275
So let's jump in.

12
00:00:47,295 --> 00:00:53,195
So let's talk about evaluation
evolution of cloud architecture.

13
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,169
Let's start with how cloud
infrastructure has evolved.

14
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,930
Initially, we had traditional
infrastructure, manual provisioning,

15
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,080
fixed capacity, and reactive management.

16
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,490
Then came cloud migration, which offered.

17
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:20,399
Elasticity, scalability and automation,
but the real leap forward is the

18
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:22,199
machine learning integration.

19
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,310
This brought us
intelligent infrastructure.

20
00:01:26,985 --> 00:01:31,665
Systems that predict,
optimize and self-heal.

21
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:38,025
Self-healing is a big thing in the
contemporary business because all

22
00:01:38,025 --> 00:01:42,615
the enterprise technologies, all
the enterprise companies or the

23
00:01:42,615 --> 00:01:47,175
businesses today, they are looking
for the systems which can self-heal.

24
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:52,635
So today, as I said, we are
entering the era of intelligent

25
00:01:52,635 --> 00:01:54,855
platforms, infrastructure.

26
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,540
That continuously optimizes
itself delivering resilience

27
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,480
and efficiency by design

28
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,100
the new cloud architect.

29
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,740
Now this transformation demands
a new breed of architect.

30
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,160
So today's cloud leaders must blend.

31
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:24,570
Strategic machine learning integration,
aligning machine learning with business

32
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:30,270
goals, so aligning machine learning
capabilities with core business

33
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:36,630
objectives and the value creation,
advanced machine learning engineering.

34
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:43,050
So we have to ensure that designing
and implementing sophisticated

35
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,820
machine learning models.

36
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:51,045
Optimized for cloud environment
infrastructure mastery.

37
00:02:51,225 --> 00:02:52,185
That's very important.

38
00:02:52,695 --> 00:02:58,515
Leveraging deep cloud architecture
expertise as the essential foundation.

39
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:03,825
So modern cloud architectures
must develop a sophisticated

40
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:06,440
understanding of machine learning.

41
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:14,984
Alongside traditional infrastructure
expertise to create a very functional

42
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:21,045
and very true intelligent platforms
that deliver measurable business value.

43
00:03:22,364 --> 00:03:27,434
Let's get onto the next slide now,
machine learning frameworks for cloud.

44
00:03:27,765 --> 00:03:29,549
Now let's look at the building blocks.

45
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:36,629
There are four key frameworks powering
this transformation, TensorFlow on cloud.

46
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,830
TensorFlow.

47
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:43,740
It dynamically scales complex
machine learning workloads across

48
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:49,020
distributed cloud infrastructure,
which enables enterprise grade

49
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,390
model training and deployment.

50
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:57,230
I. Cube flow where Kubernetes is one
of the trending things in the market.

51
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:03,170
So cube flow, which orchestrates end
to end machine learning workflows

52
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:09,680
on Kubernetes, streamlining model
development training, and serving

53
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:16,070
in containerized environment,
machine learning ops platforms.

54
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:21,570
So this is very critical because it
automates the entire machine learning

55
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:29,040
lifecycle from development to production,
ensuring reproducibility, governance,

56
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,650
and continuous model monitoring.

57
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:39,690
And the final one is the Cloud ML
services, which delivers production

58
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:45,180
ready APIs for vision, language,
and predictive analytics tasks.

59
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:52,349
Accelerating time to market without
extensive machine learning expertise.

60
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:00,570
So as I said today, accelerating
acceleration, innovation, and

61
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,900
ready to move already to use APIs.

62
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,400
That's the vision, that's the
language, and that's the production.

63
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,000
So together.

64
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:15,075
They may democratize machine learning,
making it scalable and manageable

65
00:05:15,104 --> 00:05:17,895
within cloud native environments.

66
00:05:19,305 --> 00:05:20,445
Let's get onto to the next slide.

67
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:23,745
Governance for success Now,

68
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:30,224
but innovation without governance
invites chaos, as you all know.

69
00:05:30,645 --> 00:05:31,469
So a miss.

70
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,255
A successful machine learning
platform demands standards

71
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:38,655
for architectural consistency.

72
00:05:39,615 --> 00:05:42,825
So it defines standards.

73
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:48,975
We need to ensure that we are establishing
comprehensive guidelines and architectural

74
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:53,775
principles for machine learning
implementations across the enterprise.

75
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:56,235
Iterate and improve.

76
00:05:56,745 --> 00:05:58,650
No leverage.

77
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:04,724
The outcome data to continuously
refine machine learning, implementation

78
00:06:04,724 --> 00:06:11,054
strategies, and governance frameworks
ensure conce compliance is very important

79
00:06:11,114 --> 00:06:19,405
because implementing robust monitoring
systems to verify adhering to security

80
00:06:19,405 --> 00:06:24,925
protocols, regulatory requirements, and
ethical AI standards is very important.

81
00:06:25,795 --> 00:06:26,965
Measure outcome.

82
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:28,915
So there should be metrics out of it.

83
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:35,635
So deploy comprehensive metrics to
quantify business value and written

84
00:06:35,635 --> 00:06:41,575
on investment of machine learning
initiatives against strategic objectives.

85
00:06:43,885 --> 00:06:45,025
Let's go to the next slide.

86
00:06:46,045 --> 00:06:50,675
Now let me bring this to life
with a healthcare use case.

87
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:58,955
So what are the challenges a provider
faced a 30% readmission rate and

88
00:06:58,955 --> 00:07:02,435
only 65% diagnostic accuracy.

89
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:05,855
Now, what will be the
solution for this now?

90
00:07:06,065 --> 00:07:10,565
Cloud-based machine learning
algorithms, which are integrated

91
00:07:10,565 --> 00:07:12,605
with existing EHR systems.

92
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:19,205
That enables real time clinical decision
support and predictive analytics.

93
00:07:20,045 --> 00:07:24,755
How should the implementation
and what will be the results now

94
00:07:25,085 --> 00:07:27,125
deploying machine learning models?

95
00:07:27,845 --> 00:07:35,135
Analyzing patient vitals, lab results,
medication data, and social determinants

96
00:07:35,435 --> 00:07:41,495
of health to predict deterioration,
risks and recommend interventions.

97
00:07:42,455 --> 00:07:48,155
It also helps in implementing
cloud-based machine learning, as

98
00:07:48,155 --> 00:07:54,215
I said, which are integrated with
EHRs that flags the risks early.

99
00:07:54,665 --> 00:07:55,595
You know the results.

100
00:07:56,465 --> 00:07:59,315
Readmissions dropped 47%.

101
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:06,125
Accuracy jumped to 92%, and
the most importantly, savings

102
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,705
exceeded 3 million annually.

103
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:13,775
That's the power of machine
learning applied strategically.

104
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,315
Let's go to the next slide now.

105
00:08:17,405 --> 00:08:19,445
Machine learning value creation.

106
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:21,845
This is not theory.

107
00:08:21,905 --> 00:08:23,165
This is measurable.

108
00:08:23,825 --> 00:08:27,605
42% improvement in operational efficiency.

109
00:08:28,265 --> 00:08:33,184
So when you enhance resource
utilization across cloud

110
00:08:33,184 --> 00:08:35,855
infrastructure, that's the value.

111
00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:37,655
That's the improvement we have shown.

112
00:08:38,345 --> 00:08:41,615
67% is true resolution Now.

113
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:49,295
When accelerated anomaly detection and
automated remediation is in place, we will

114
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:53,735
be able to resolve the issues much prior.

115
00:08:54,305 --> 00:08:57,395
So that's the number, that's the
percentage which we are seeing.

116
00:08:57,575 --> 00:09:06,125
67% faster issue resolution, 31%
reduction in cloud costs in the

117
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,035
contemporary market where the businesses.

118
00:09:09,319 --> 00:09:16,069
And the enterprises are looking
for optimization to save money.

119
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:21,980
Optimized cloud spending through
intelligent resource allocation is helping

120
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:30,535
to reduce costs, and most importantly, 3.5
x faster innovation cycles now accelerated

121
00:09:30,645 --> 00:09:33,560
time to market for business critical.

122
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,970
Capabilities.

123
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:40,670
So these numbers are real world
outcomes from enterprises investing

124
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,590
in intelligent infrastructure.

125
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,270
Now human machine collaboration.

126
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:53,060
Let's talk about, let's dive into
the types of machine learning now.

127
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,920
Supervised learning, which
powers anomaly detection and

128
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,595
predictive resource planning.

129
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,490
So engineers.

130
00:10:01,865 --> 00:10:07,415
They provide labeled data, enabling
models to learn from established

131
00:10:07,415 --> 00:10:12,575
patterns and expert knowledge,
real-time infrastructure, anomaly

132
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:17,944
detection, intelligent cloud
resource optimization, predictive

133
00:10:17,944 --> 00:10:20,135
capacity planning, and forecasting.

134
00:10:20,555 --> 00:10:23,435
They are the benefits
of supervised learning.

135
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:28,145
Now, unsupervised learning
also helps us a lot.

136
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:33,140
It helps us to discover hidden
patterns for performance optimization.

137
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,080
It the systems autonomously discover
hidden patterns within cloud

138
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,740
telemetry without explicit guidance.

139
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,640
That is wonderful.

140
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:49,730
Uncovering non-obvious system
correlations and performance clustering

141
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,660
for targeted improvements and workload
segmentation for optimization.

142
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:58,745
The last one, which is really
crucial, the reinforcement learning.

143
00:10:59,165 --> 00:11:04,865
It gives us self-healing systems
and dynamic security responses.

144
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:12,875
It saves lot of resources,
algorithms, which iteratively improve

145
00:11:12,995 --> 00:11:18,275
operational decisions by balancing
exploration with exploitation,

146
00:11:19,205 --> 00:11:21,515
dynamic infrastructure, auto-scaling.

147
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:28,190
Self-optimizing network configurations,
adaptive security response.

148
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:31,730
These are the vital things
of reinforcement learning.

149
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:33,530
This is the future.

150
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,960
Humans guiding machines and
machines learning from operations.

151
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,500
Let's get onto the next slide now.

152
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,740
What should be the organizational
readiness for this?

153
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:50,439
Success hinges not just on tick,
but on the organization's readiness.

154
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:51,610
What do you say?

155
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,210
Awareness on machine learning's potential
now by cultivating organizational

156
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:04,300
understanding of machine learning
capabilities and strategic opportunities

157
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,920
for business transformation.

158
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,020
So we need to ensure that we create
this kind of awareness for machine

159
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,780
learning's, potential skill development.

160
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,010
Through upskilling and hiring.

161
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:23,070
So investing in talent acquisition
and upskilling existing staff to

162
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:29,880
build robust internal machine learning
cap competencies or infrastructure

163
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,180
preparation with scalable infrastructure.

164
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,770
What can be done?

165
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:35,460
No.

166
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,900
We need to understand what is
the existing infrastructure

167
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,690
we have establishing scalable.

168
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:48,310
Technical foundations with appropriate
data, architecture, processing

169
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,040
capabilities and integration points, and.

170
00:12:52,765 --> 00:12:57,925
One should have clear implementation
plans that aligns with the business.

171
00:12:58,315 --> 00:13:04,945
So executing strategic machine learning
powered initiatives with clear business

172
00:13:04,945 --> 00:13:10,495
outcomes measurement framework and
continuous improvement circle cycles.

173
00:13:10,975 --> 00:13:16,170
It by which by doing all these
things, we can ensure that the.

174
00:13:16,705 --> 00:13:23,725
Organizational readiness is met, and
we are on the way to adopt intelligent

175
00:13:24,115 --> 00:13:26,725
learning and artificial intelligence.

176
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:29,905
Now, let's get onto the next slide.

177
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:35,665
For every new thing,
there will be challenges.

178
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:40,435
There will be implementation challenges,
and let's be honest, it's not easy.

179
00:13:41,035 --> 00:13:42,625
So there will be key challenges.

180
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,815
Key challenges would be the data quality.

181
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,680
Meaning like garbage in, garbage out.

182
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:54,940
Poor data integrity severely undermines
modal performance established.

183
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,220
We need to ensure that we are establishing
comprehensive data governance frameworks

184
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:07,000
and advanced pre-processing workflows
to ensure reliable inputs for machine

185
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,325
learning systems integration complexity.

186
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,435
Legacy systems, they create friction.

187
00:14:14,065 --> 00:14:20,365
So entrenched legacy infrastructure
creates significant integration barriers.

188
00:14:20,995 --> 00:14:26,455
So make sure we deploy modern
APIs and robust microservices

189
00:14:26,695 --> 00:14:31,735
architecture, which can seamlessly
connect machine learning capabilities

190
00:14:32,065 --> 00:14:34,315
with existing enterprise systems.

191
00:14:35,035 --> 00:14:38,635
Skill shortages, no machine
learning talent is cars.

192
00:14:39,535 --> 00:14:43,915
So ensure that critical machine
learning talent remains in

193
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:46,015
high demand at short supply.

194
00:14:47,365 --> 00:14:52,915
So develop targeted upskilling
programs and implement strategic

195
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:58,045
recruitment initiatives to secure
essential expertise across data

196
00:14:58,045 --> 00:15:00,445
science and engineering domains.

197
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:04,915
As I said, critical machine learning
talent remains in high demand.

198
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:11,230
But we have a short supply, so make sure
that we are developing targeted people

199
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,090
with upskilling programs and ensure
to implement strategic recruitment

200
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,520
initiatives change resistance.

201
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:22,090
Cultural inertia can slow
progress, as you all know.

202
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:27,795
So organizational inertia, frequently
derails machine learning adoption efforts.

203
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,880
Ensure that we are crafting
comprehensive transition strategies,

204
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:40,360
highlighting tangible business outcomes
and establish executive champions

205
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,780
to drive cultural transformation.

206
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,315
So each of these must be
tackled head on with governance,

207
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,195
communication, and training.

208
00:15:51,965 --> 00:15:53,195
Let's get onto the next slide.

209
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:55,715
What should be the steps?

210
00:15:56,485 --> 00:15:57,865
How can we achieve this?

211
00:15:58,915 --> 00:16:00,625
What, where do we start?

212
00:16:01,465 --> 00:16:03,295
How do we assess the current state?

213
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:04,885
What's ready, what's not?

214
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:09,865
We need to ensure we are evaluating
infrastructure readiness and

215
00:16:09,865 --> 00:16:11,335
machine learning potential.

216
00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:14,665
Identify high value use cases.

217
00:16:15,355 --> 00:16:17,635
Then develop a strategic roadmap.

218
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,215
Don't just do ml. Define
where it delivers value.

219
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:28,510
Meaning we need to create a roadmap
with prioritized initiatives.

220
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:34,030
Establish governance framework,
which is going to help us to

221
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,770
develop a strategic roadmap.

222
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,370
Start small with high value pilots.

223
00:16:39,895 --> 00:16:45,385
Now for us to grow big, we need to
start small then, so then scale up

224
00:16:45,385 --> 00:16:47,845
fast using repeatable frameworks.

225
00:16:48,295 --> 00:16:54,505
Begin with targeted pilots, document
learning and expand successful patterns.

226
00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:55,795
Make sure that.

227
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:01,735
We are documenting our success, our
failure, our learnings that will help us

228
00:17:01,735 --> 00:17:04,465
to have successful patterns going forward.

229
00:17:05,245 --> 00:17:08,185
Now with this I wrap my session.

230
00:17:08,725 --> 00:17:14,335
Machine learning is not just enhancing
cloud infrastructure, it's reinventing it.

231
00:17:14,995 --> 00:17:19,765
As cloud leaders, our role is
not just to adopt technology,

232
00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:22,345
but to engineer intelligence.

233
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,990
Into the core of our platforms.

234
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,850
Thank you for your time today.

235
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,310
I hope everybody liked my session.

236
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,035
Thanks a lot.
