1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,460
Hello everybody.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,390
I'm Dika and I am here to present a
session dedicated to speed, intelligence,

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,910
and the future of JavaScript.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,650
Imagine your favorite web application,
whether it's a shopping site, a dashboard,

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,170
or a chat tool, running twice as fast,
handling twice as many users and never

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,760
slowing down even under heavy load.

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,670
Today we'll explore how intelligent
optimization can make this a reality.

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,810
Delivering up to 2.29
times throughput gains.

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:34,800
Let's dive in

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,510
the performance challenge
in modern JavaScript.

11
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:43,709
Modern JavaScript applications
are like bustling cities full of

12
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:48,330
unpredictable traffic changing
conditions, and users with diverse needs.

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,870
Consider an online retailer
during a major sale event,

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,090
thousand of users flood the site.

15
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,370
Each interacting in different ways.

16
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,090
The backend strains under the load and
the front end struggles to keep up.

17
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,160
Traditional optimization, relying
on static configurations and manual

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,690
tweaks often falls short In these
dynamic environments, what's needed

19
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,980
is a system that sends traffic adapts
in real time and keeps everything

20
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,870
running smoothly no matter what.

21
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,750
That's the promise of
intelligent optimization.

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,710
Now, here is our journey today.

23
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,360
First, we'll uncover the secrets of
intelligent optimization, what makes

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,130
it different, and why it matters.

25
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:34,410
Next, we'll see how no JS backends
can become self tuning engines

26
00:01:34,589 --> 00:01:36,539
handling API requests efficiently.

27
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,960
Then we'll explore how frontend frameworks
like React, view, and Angular can become

28
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,600
smarter, faster, and more responsive.

29
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:48,765
We look at real world
deployments and results.

30
00:01:48,914 --> 00:01:52,304
Finally, I'll provide a practical
guide to start using these

31
00:01:52,304 --> 00:01:54,105
techniques in your own projects.

32
00:01:54,195 --> 00:01:54,645
Ready?

33
00:01:54,945 --> 00:01:55,395
Let's go.

34
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,685
Intelligent versus
traditional optimization.

35
00:02:00,135 --> 00:02:04,335
Let's compare two words In the traditional
approach, optimization is static.

36
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:08,415
Configurations are set, code is
steel, and the system is left to run.

37
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:13,394
This is like driving a car
with fixed gear, fine on a flat

38
00:02:13,394 --> 00:02:15,375
road, but inefficient on hills.

39
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,589
In contrast, Intele intelligent
optimization is dynamic.

40
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,170
The system watches, learns and
adapts like a car that shift gears

41
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,610
automatically sensing the and
adjusting for speed and efficiency.

42
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,110
For example, streaming platforms
adjust video quality based

43
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,240
on bandwidth in JavaScript.

44
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,990
Intelligent optimization means
your app concerns when memory

45
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,940
is tight, when requests spike.

46
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,650
And when user needs instant feedback
and it add in, it adapts in real

47
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,870
time to maintain high performance.

48
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,870
Now let's talk about no JS Black
and intelligent resource allocation.

49
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,600
No JS server often face searches in
requests and fluctuating memory usage.

50
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,710
Static resource allocation can
lead to bottlenecks and slowdowns.

51
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,640
Intelligent optimization acts like
a master chef in a busy kitchen.

52
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:14,730
Monitoring orders, reallocating staff,
and tuning operations for peak efficiency.

53
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,850
By using adaptive worker pools, connecting
pools and event loop monitoring systems

54
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,290
can automatically shift resources
during high traffic, keeping latency

55
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,210
low, and user experiences smooth.

56
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,695
These techniques are widely adopted
in industries where API throughput

57
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:37,079
and reliability are critical, such
as finance, retail, and logistics.

58
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:42,735
Now what is React performance
and adaptive component rendering?

59
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:44,715
Let's move to the front end.

60
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:49,365
React applications can suffer from
unnecessary component rear renders

61
00:03:50,115 --> 00:03:51,825
leading to sluggish performance.

62
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:55,875
Adaptive component rendering is
like a smart director in a theater

63
00:03:56,595 --> 00:04:00,255
ensuring only the necessary actors
are on the stage at the right time.

64
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:05,895
By monitoring render cycles, memorizing
components, and using lazy loading

65
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:10,815
applications can prioritize critical UI
updates and differ less important ones.

66
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:14,895
This approach is commonly used
in online learning platforms

67
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:19,214
and interactive dashboards where
reducing time to interactive is

68
00:04:19,245 --> 00:04:20,774
essential for user engagement.

69
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:26,115
Let's see, what is a performance
impact and talk about the results.

70
00:04:27,045 --> 00:04:28,905
These improvements are
not just theoretical.

71
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,229
They're measured in
production environments.

72
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:32,940
What are the results?

73
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,159
2.29 times throughput gains
application handle more users faster.

74
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,740
40% bundle as reduction, smaller
downloads, and quicker strats.

75
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,960
60% faster load times.

76
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,640
Users see content very sooner.

77
00:04:48,565 --> 00:04:52,560
Three times API response improvement
backends process requests

78
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,510
more efficiently, for example.

79
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,160
Let's take a global.

80
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,130
Retailers have reported checkout
times, dropping from several

81
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,230
seconds to under two seconds.

82
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,830
During peak sales events, these
metrics translate directly to

83
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:08,520
happier user, increased revenue,
and reduced operational stress.

84
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,170
The architecture, how
big is the architecture?

85
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,710
I would say it has a lightweight
architecture with minimal

86
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,300
overhead and maximum impact.

87
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,980
So does intelligent optimization
request massive infrastructure?

88
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,480
No, not at all.

89
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,160
Modern, lightweight architectures deliver
substantial gains with minimal overhead.

90
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:34,650
Think of it as a high performance
bicycle light, agile, and fast

91
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,150
without the bulk of a car.

92
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,070
Even startups with modest cloud
resources can support thousands of

93
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:46,530
concurrent users by leveraging adaptive
optimization, low CPU footprint, minimal

94
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,990
memory consumption, and fast adaption.

95
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,250
Make this approach practical
for organization of all sizes.

96
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:57,825
What is the frontend
optimization across frameworks?

97
00:05:58,545 --> 00:06:00,015
Let's zoom out to the bigger picture.

98
00:06:00,615 --> 00:06:03,405
Whether you use react, view, or angular.

99
00:06:03,645 --> 00:06:07,125
Intelligent optimization
brings benefits, react.

100
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:13,155
It benefits from start, start smarter
rendering and state management view it.

101
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:17,265
S reactor system optimization and
template enhancements, angular.

102
00:06:17,355 --> 00:06:22,125
IT gains from change detection and
ahead of time compilation, for instance.

103
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:27,405
SaaS dashboards built with view
have reduced runtime by 30%

104
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:29,385
using computer property caching.

105
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:34,725
Automated performance tuning works
across frameworks with each platform

106
00:06:34,725 --> 00:06:36,555
benefiting from tailored strategies.

107
00:06:36,795 --> 00:06:39,885
No matter your stack, there's
a path to better performance,

108
00:06:42,255 --> 00:06:43,995
practical implementation strategies.

109
00:06:44,565 --> 00:06:46,635
How do you put these ideas into practice?

110
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,525
It starts with runtime integration.

111
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:53,115
Embedding optimization into your
JavaScript runtime for automatic tuning.

112
00:06:53,775 --> 00:06:57,285
Adaptive resource allocation in
node js allows system to shift

113
00:06:57,285 --> 00:07:00,885
resource dynamically respond
to real world chain uses.

114
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:06,015
Multi objective optimization
means balancing speed, memory, and

115
00:07:06,015 --> 00:07:07,815
user experience simultaneously.

116
00:07:09,015 --> 00:07:12,795
These strategies are increasingly
adopted in industries like

117
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:16,720
logistics, where real time tracking
and responsiveness are essential.

118
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:23,310
So let's talk about the
industry applications where

119
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,080
optimization matters most.

120
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,590
So where does it matter
most in e-commerce?

121
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,570
In e-commerce platforms?

122
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,480
Fast page loads and
smooth checkout drives.

123
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,170
The sales.

124
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,260
How about apps in real time?

125
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:42,060
Apps, chat and dashboard needs instant
response in progressive web apps.

126
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,920
Offline capabilities and app-like
performance demand, efficient resource

127
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,680
management in serverless functions, cold
start optimization and efficient execution

128
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,230
are critical for cost and performance.

129
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:01,890
For example, real-time chat applications
often use adaptive optimization to

130
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:06,690
keep message delivery under a hundred
milliseconds, even during viral specs,

131
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,000
ensuring a seamless user experience.

132
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,580
Now let's talk code.

133
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:14,295
TypeScript implementation approaches.

134
00:08:15,585 --> 00:08:19,515
TypeScript is a powerful tool for
intelligent optimization types.

135
00:08:19,695 --> 00:08:24,195
Optimization means catching errors at
compile time, improving documentation,

136
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:28,815
and making code easier to maintain
patterns like generic interfaces,

137
00:08:28,995 --> 00:08:33,075
type guards, decorators and union
types help keep optimization

138
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:35,235
code robust as application scale.

139
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:39,105
Healthcare and financial
applications often use tax script

140
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:40,934
decorators to monitor performance.

141
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,750
Catching bottleneck before reach
production, and ensuring reliability.

142
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,510
What are the common challenges and
the solutions to those challenges?

143
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,189
Let's discuss about that.

144
00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:55,470
Every journey has obstacles.

145
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,740
Obstacles, bundle size, so large
bundles, slow initial load.

146
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,110
And the solution for that is
code splitting, tree shaking,

147
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,140
and dynamic imports with
intelligent loading priorities.

148
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,364
Next, we need to consider
the runtime efficiency.

149
00:09:14,114 --> 00:09:19,395
So how the runtime efficiency affects
the performance drops during peak usage.

150
00:09:20,145 --> 00:09:23,564
This needs adaptive resource
allocation and intelligent caching.

151
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:29,594
Now, door manipulation, overhead
at CE updates calls junk.

152
00:09:30,285 --> 00:09:34,005
So the batch operations, efficient
virtual DM and prioritizing

153
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:35,655
visible content are the solution.

154
00:09:36,614 --> 00:09:41,160
API bottle x. Backend latency
hurts a user experiences.

155
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,449
So the request prioritization,
intelligent caching, and productive

156
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:47,040
prefetching is needed here.

157
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,719
So let's take an example of a
travel booking sites use productive

158
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:55,619
prefetching to load flight
data before users even search.

159
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,514
This would cut times dramatically.

160
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,410
So what are the key takeaways and next
steps, what you should remember now?

161
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,879
Start with the measurement.

162
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,300
Know your baseline before you optimize.

163
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:11,519
Apply adaptive strategies.

164
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:15,959
Move beyond static configurations
to runtime optimization.

165
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:18,420
Leverage lightweight architectures.

166
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,319
Smart algorithms deliver results
efficiently without massive

167
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:24,749
overhead test in production.

168
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:27,810
Real world performance is what it matters.

169
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,790
The future of JavaScript performance
is intelligent adaptive optimization.

170
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,240
Start today and watch your
applications transfer.

171
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:38,820
Thank you.

172
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,710
I hope you inspired.

173
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,370
You are inspired to explore intelligent
optimization in your own projects.

174
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,810
And with this, I would
like to end the session.
