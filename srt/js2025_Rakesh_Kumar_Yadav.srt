1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,690
I am Amud Yado, and it's truly a pleasure
to be speaking at Con 42 JavaScript 2025.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,320
I have spent over 13 years in the
IT industry working across a variety

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,640
of sector, including IT, telecom,
discrete manufacturing, oil and

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,980
gas, NGOs, and higher education.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,370
Currently I'm with a medical college
in the higher education domain where

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,760
we are exploring innovative way to
reduce administrative and clinical

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,440
workflow for our healthcare staff.

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,530
That's where my journey with
JavaScript took an interesting turn.

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,449
I started seeing how it's evolving
capabilities, especially when paired

11
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:36,260
with artificial intelligence could make a
real difference in healthcare operation.

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,580
So today, without further delay, let's
dive into our topic, how JavaScript

13
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:45,170
and artificial intes are transforming
healthcare operations, not as a buzzword,

14
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,390
but through miserable real world outcome.

15
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,239
In this season, we will bring
together two powerful worlds.

16
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,590
Healthcare operational challenges
and JavaScript AI driving potential

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,610
to see how technology can truly
enhance the way care is delivered.

18
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,920
The Healthcare operations Challenge.

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,009
Let's take a moment to look at the
reality of healthcare operation today.

20
00:01:05,039 --> 00:01:09,600
Clinician and staffs are under immense
pressure, not because of patient care.

21
00:01:10,134 --> 00:01:14,275
But because of everything around it, a
staggering amount of their time goes into

22
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:19,585
administrative work, such as updating,
record managing, handling billings,

23
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:21,625
juggling multiple disconnected system.

24
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:24,835
Most of these processes still
rely on legacy platform that

25
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,725
are slow, soiled, and prone to.

26
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,120
Error and the result is frustration,
inefficiency, and less time for

27
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,310
what really matters patient care.

28
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,270
Now our goal here is to
replace people far from it.

29
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,650
The real opportunity lies in augmenting
human capability using technology to

30
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,570
take the burden of their shoulder.

31
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,830
By integrating intelligent JavaScript
based AI tool, we can automate

32
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,669
those repetitive manual tasks,
reduce operational friction, and

33
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:54,289
allow human to focus on what.

34
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,735
They do best judgment,
compassion, and empty.

35
00:01:57,825 --> 00:01:59,385
So why JavaScript?

36
00:01:59,515 --> 00:02:01,615
The simple answer is
because it's everywhere.

37
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,060
Think about it, whether it's
your browser, your phone, or

38
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,860
even a tablet in a hospital room.

39
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,410
JavaScripts run on all of them.

40
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,020
There's no complex setup,
no heavy installation.

41
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,860
It is just work.

42
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:17,000
And with powerful framework like
React, angular, and no js, we

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,510
can develop, deploy, and update
solution faster than ever before.

44
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,520
What really makes JavaScript
special is massive ecosystem.

45
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,390
Thousands of ready to use module for
data visualization, API integration

46
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,220
and intelligent automation.

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:30,989
And if you have your.

48
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:34,960
Worked in healthcare, you know how
critical those capabilities are.

49
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:40,180
Pulling data from multiple system, showing
it clearly and acting on it in real time.

50
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,910
And speaking of real time,
that's another strength.

51
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,300
JavaScripts truly science
in live communication.

52
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,700
Powering dashboard alerts and
notification that keep operations moving

53
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,950
smoothly when seconds really matter.

54
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,500
So JavaScript isn't just convenience.

55
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,790
It's the language that meets healthcare
where it already is connected,

56
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,340
fast and accessible to everyone.

57
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,030
At the heart of modern healthcare,
AI integration lies one powerful

58
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,540
combination, the nod js and react stack.

59
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,625
Let's start with nod js.

60
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,950
Microservices architecture allow
every healthcare module, whether it's

61
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:20,110
scheduling, billing, or analytics to
grow and evolve independently without

62
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,190
bringing the whole system down, and then
thes react, which ensure a consistent

63
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,050
and intuitive front-end experience.

64
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,310
Whether a user is managing appointments,
viewing patient data, or reviewing

65
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,030
reports, when you bring the two
together, you get flexibility,

66
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,370
scalability, and maintainability.

67
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,270
Three things.

68
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,790
Every healthcare IT system
struggle to balance.

69
00:03:40,075 --> 00:03:44,095
And the best part, this modular
approach means hospitals don't

70
00:03:44,095 --> 00:03:45,955
have to rebuild everything at once.

71
00:03:46,255 --> 00:03:50,185
They can start a small, maybe pilot
a single service like scheduling,

72
00:03:50,245 --> 00:03:54,985
and once it is successful, expand to
inventory, finance, or even analytics,

73
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:57,055
all without starting from scratch.

74
00:03:57,205 --> 00:04:00,235
That's the real power of this stack
it grow with your organization.

75
00:04:00,955 --> 00:04:01,705
One service.

76
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,380
At a time impact area.

77
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,500
Let's talk about one of
the toughest challenge in

78
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,270
healthcare operation scheduling.

79
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:12,230
It sounds simple, but it's actually
one of the most complex puzzle

80
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,930
hospital deal with every single day.

81
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,580
You have got to balance staff ability,
skill mix, patient demand, regulatory

82
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:24,830
rules, and of course all those last minute
changes that never stops coming Now.

83
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:28,515
Here is where JavaScript
based interface comes in.

84
00:04:28,724 --> 00:04:33,465
They can process all these constraint
in real time, automatically optimizing

85
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:35,355
rosters and suggesting assignment.

86
00:04:35,505 --> 00:04:39,315
Still keeping the human scheduler
in control for the final decision

87
00:04:39,825 --> 00:04:44,175
In one pilot project, this
approach reduce over time by 25%

88
00:04:44,175 --> 00:04:46,455
and cut schedule revision by 40%.

89
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:51,495
And that's not just about efficiency, it's
about happier staff, better cost control.

90
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,610
Ultimately improved patient flow
because when people aren't exhausted

91
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,230
or overbooked, patient get better care
and the whole system run is smoother.

92
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,730
Inventory is one of those
silent pain point in healthcare.

93
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,370
When supplies run out,
patient care suffer.

94
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:12,780
When we overstock valuable capital
sales and used on the selves, it's

95
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,740
a delicate balance and for years,
most hospital have been managing it

96
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,110
with fragmented system and casework.

97
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,910
Now with React based dashboard, powered
by JavaScript and DI that is starting

98
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,620
to change these system provide real
time visibility across department so

99
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,570
everyone from procurement to nursing
unions can see what's exactly available.

100
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,580
Predictive analytics, health forecast
usage strength, automated alerts

101
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:44,080
makes your restocking happen one
time and cost optimization algorithm

102
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,970
can even suggest better supply deal.

103
00:05:46,495 --> 00:05:49,015
The outcome, a self-learning supply chain.

104
00:05:49,104 --> 00:05:52,914
One where data drives both saving
and Sept, because in healthcare,

105
00:05:52,974 --> 00:05:56,125
right item at the right time can
literally make all the difference

106
00:05:56,245 --> 00:05:58,945
impact area financial automation.

107
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:03,715
Now let's talk about another big challenge
in healthcare, financial workflow.

108
00:06:04,195 --> 00:06:07,375
From claim to reimbursement,
the process is complex.

109
00:06:07,585 --> 00:06:11,604
Every steps involve layer of
validation, coding, and compliance.

110
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,970
And even a small error can
delay payment or trigger rework.

111
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,380
There is where JavaScript drive and
automation start to make a real impact.

112
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,280
With AI model running behind the
scene, the system can automatically

113
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,420
flag missing information, validate
billing code, and even optimize

114
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,100
claim before they are submitted.

115
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,345
The result speak for themselves.

116
00:06:33,205 --> 00:06:36,955
We have seen up to 35% faster
claim processing and nearly

117
00:06:36,955 --> 00:06:38,665
18% higher revenue capture.

118
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:40,165
And it's not magic.

119
00:06:40,315 --> 00:06:43,885
It's simply consistency and
error prevention powered

120
00:06:43,885 --> 00:06:45,385
by intelligent automation.

121
00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:51,534
When accuracy become automatic efficiency
and revenue flow naturally the human

122
00:06:51,534 --> 00:06:56,965
experience, we often think of success
in term of ROI or performance metrics,

123
00:06:57,355 --> 00:07:01,465
but the real measure of success
is pupil when AI and JavaScripts.

124
00:07:02,275 --> 00:07:03,205
Come together.

125
00:07:03,385 --> 00:07:07,555
They take on the busy work, the
form, the admin task, freeing the

126
00:07:07,555 --> 00:07:12,595
staff to focus on what truly matter
Patient care, AI helps surface the

127
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:16,945
right insight at the right time,
boosting confidence in every decision,

128
00:07:16,945 --> 00:07:18,985
and cutting down on costly error.

129
00:07:19,135 --> 00:07:22,345
And when there is less
rework, there is less burnout.

130
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:26,755
That means caregiver have more energy,
more focus, and more heart to give.

131
00:07:26,995 --> 00:07:29,155
So yes, technology drives efficiency.

132
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:34,719
It's the real success is measured in the
wellbeing of the people who use it and the

133
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:37,150
better care they deliver every single day.

134
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,110
Design principle, user experience
in healthcare has to be clear,

135
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,420
con, contextual, and safe.

136
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:47,560
Visual clarity has basic clinician
move confidently through complex task.

137
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,630
Contextual action.

138
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:54,670
Bring up the right option at the right
moment based on each person's role and

139
00:07:54,670 --> 00:08:00,220
workflow and proactive validation catches
error before they ever reach to patient.

140
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,620
That's why modern JavaScript framework
like React and VU are so powerful.

141
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:11,185
The enable responsive, intelligent
interfaces that adapt seamlessly to each

142
00:08:11,185 --> 00:08:13,555
user in every critical moment of care.

143
00:08:14,034 --> 00:08:18,115
Because in healthcare, a well design
experience isn't just convenient.

144
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:22,705
It's life saving technical architecture
from an engineering standpoint.

145
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,840
There are three key pillar
of a robust architecture.

146
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,490
First, microservices.

147
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,570
They decouple complex system like
scheduling, billing, and analytics,

148
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,170
so each can evolve independently
without breaking the rest.

149
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,400
Second, state management with
tool like Redux, all the context

150
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,660
API, and data stays consistent and
reliable across every workflow.

151
00:08:44,095 --> 00:08:49,585
No matter how complex and third, real
time synchronization using web socket

152
00:08:49,585 --> 00:08:54,355
or servers sent event, keep dashboard,
live, responsive, and ready for action.

153
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:59,275
Together these principle build an
architecture that's not just efficient,

154
00:08:59,275 --> 00:09:03,625
but resilient, ready to scale and
perform in mission critical healthcare,

155
00:09:03,655 --> 00:09:08,545
envir environments, integration
challenges and solution integration is

156
00:09:08,545 --> 00:09:10,254
often the hardest part of healthcare.

157
00:09:10,254 --> 00:09:11,724
It not the AI itself.

158
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:17,425
Legacy PIs comes with inconsistent
format, and that's where abstraction

159
00:09:17,425 --> 00:09:18,835
layer make all the difference.

160
00:09:19,405 --> 00:09:21,835
They unify the kiosk behind the scene.

161
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:26,185
Then comes data synchronization with
even driving architecture update flow

162
00:09:26,185 --> 00:09:31,225
seamlessly across multiple system, keeping
everything accurate and current security.

163
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,295
That's absolutely non-negotiable.

164
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:37,464
End-to-end encryption, role-based
access and detailed audit log.

165
00:09:37,464 --> 00:09:39,565
Protect every piece of patient data.

166
00:09:39,985 --> 00:09:41,454
And finally, performance.

167
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,910
Techniques like laser loading,
ation and smart casting.

168
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,170
Keep the experiences smooth even when
we are working with massive dataset.

169
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,225
In the end.

170
00:09:51,395 --> 00:09:52,305
Great healthcare tech.

171
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,295
Agent, just intelligent.

172
00:09:54,415 --> 00:09:59,125
It's secure, reliable, and effortless
to use implementation framework.

173
00:09:59,335 --> 00:10:03,055
Here is a structure four phase
framework for implementing AI and

174
00:10:03,055 --> 00:10:05,095
JavaScript Phase one foundation.

175
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:09,775
We start by assessing existing system,
defining clear success metrics, and

176
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:14,425
ensure full compliance with healthcare
Standard phase two development.

177
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:19,615
This is where we build modular
macroservices, create re react component,

178
00:10:19,615 --> 00:10:21,595
and test every piece thoroughly.

179
00:10:22,194 --> 00:10:23,665
Phase three deployment.

180
00:10:23,785 --> 00:10:28,515
We launch a pilot within a single
department, gather feedback and

181
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:32,415
refine the system based on real
world use and phase four scale.

182
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:36,225
Once proven, we expand, gradually
enhance the AI model and share the

183
00:10:36,225 --> 00:10:38,295
outcome across the organization.

184
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:42,345
This phase process strike the right
balance between agility and governance,

185
00:10:42,705 --> 00:10:45,015
and that's exactly what's sustainable.

186
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:48,615
Healthcare transform is
and require key takeaway.

187
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:54,329
So first takeaway is JavaScript is through
truly production ready for healthcare.

188
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,050
Its framework.

189
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,599
Deliver both speed and reliability.

190
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,989
Powering real world system
that clinician can trust.

191
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,739
Second, augment, don't
replace the best AI solution.

192
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,579
Amplify human capability, this
support professional rather

193
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,064
than trying to replace them.

194
00:11:10,314 --> 00:11:15,630
Third, the start is small, er
everything and scale strategically.

195
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:20,775
Pilots build confidence metric, build
credibility, and together they create a

196
00:11:20,775 --> 00:11:22,845
solid path towards sustainable growth.

197
00:11:23,295 --> 00:11:26,295
And if you remember just one
thing from today, let it be this.

198
00:11:26,795 --> 00:11:30,964
Progress in healthcare technology
comes from empathy paired with

199
00:11:31,114 --> 00:11:35,584
precision, because when innovations
are both the heart and the mind, that's

200
00:11:35,584 --> 00:11:37,415
when a real transformation happen.

201
00:11:37,775 --> 00:11:40,925
AI plus JavaScript in real
world healthcare use case.

202
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:43,474
So I have seen few use cases.

203
00:11:43,474 --> 00:11:48,604
Let's look at a few real world example
of how AI and JavaScript come together

204
00:11:48,604 --> 00:11:50,224
to make a difference in healthcare.

205
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:53,354
Chatbot trash, assistant
AI powered agenda that.

206
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:58,490
Pre-screen symptom and guide
patient to the right care path, real

207
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,180
time vital dashboard, continuous
monitoring, and instant ly

208
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:04,400
detection through connected devices.

209
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:08,719
Predictive appointment management,
forecasting cancellation, optimizing

210
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:13,069
schedule to keep clinic running
smoothly and AI driving image leveling.

211
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:17,839
Escalating radiology and research
by automating repetitive analysis

212
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,649
task Each of these example blend
AI's intelligence with JavaScript

213
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:26,569
accessibility, turning complex technology
into tool that deliver real miserable

214
00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:28,489
value of patient and provider alike.

215
00:12:29,194 --> 00:12:30,874
Getting started your next step.

216
00:12:31,024 --> 00:12:33,094
So how can you begin this journey?

217
00:12:33,305 --> 00:12:35,644
Step one, identify the pain points.

218
00:12:35,974 --> 00:12:37,264
Talk to your staff.

219
00:12:37,295 --> 00:12:41,764
Find out where time is being lost
and where frustration builds up.

220
00:12:42,364 --> 00:12:44,104
Step two, build your team.

221
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:48,004
Bring developer, clinician and
security expert together because

222
00:12:48,004 --> 00:12:49,864
transformation only works when.

223
00:12:50,224 --> 00:12:51,665
Every voice is heard.

224
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,005
Step three, choose your stack.

225
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:59,015
Select framework that align with your
existing skill and system, so innovation

226
00:12:59,015 --> 00:13:02,194
fits seamlessly into your workflow.

227
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:04,084
Step four, launch a pilot.

228
00:13:04,145 --> 00:13:08,915
Start small, irate, quickly measure
your result, and then scale what works.

229
00:13:08,915 --> 00:13:11,660
Remember, the path to
transfer isn't a giant leap.

230
00:13:12,109 --> 00:13:16,639
It's a small, measured step that move
healthcare forward with confidence and.

231
00:13:17,165 --> 00:13:18,035
Purpose.

232
00:13:18,094 --> 00:13:19,594
Thank you all for the time and attention.

233
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:23,405
I hope today's session offered a
fresh perspective on how JavaScript

234
00:13:23,405 --> 00:13:27,425
and AI can come together to create
meaningful challenge in healthcare.

235
00:13:27,785 --> 00:13:31,865
Let's keep pushing forward building
system that truly help people, system

236
00:13:31,865 --> 00:13:34,685
that make care faster, safer, and smarter.

237
00:13:34,775 --> 00:13:36,724
I would love to continue the conversation.
