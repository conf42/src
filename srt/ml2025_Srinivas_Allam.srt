1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,470
Hey, good day to everyone.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,140
My name is Salam.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,780
I'm part of Core I-T-S-L-L-C.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,400
Today I wanna talk about the
transforming legacy banking

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,810
system through machine learning.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,870
Today I want to share with you a real
world story, not very, not concept,

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,100
but the actual journey of how we took.

8
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:31,095
A legacy banking system and
transformed it into the digital first

9
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:33,405
mission learning driven platform.

10
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:43,155
So this transformation wasn't just
about the upgrade, it was about

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:49,364
rethinking processes, reimagining
customer experiences, and

12
00:00:49,995 --> 00:00:52,425
building an agile resilient, and.

13
00:00:53,425 --> 00:00:57,535
So over 18 months, we
revolutionized our operations

14
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:05,275
moving cloud native architecture
and adopting an API first design.

15
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:12,715
Every change we made was measured
by one simple question, does this

16
00:01:12,715 --> 00:01:17,305
make experience better for our
customers and easier for our teams?

17
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:24,640
Today, I will walk you through the
challenges we face, the architecture

18
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,759
we build, that dramatic results we
achieved, and most importantly, the

19
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:37,600
key lessons we learned that could help
anyone tackling similar transformations.

20
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:43,010
Let's see our transformation
overview here.

21
00:01:45,065 --> 00:01:50,255
So our journey unfolded through
four carefully orchestrated phases.

22
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:58,804
First one is the planning, so where we
assess our legacy systems and identify

23
00:01:58,804 --> 00:02:01,445
the key modernization priorities.

24
00:02:03,485 --> 00:02:05,845
The second one is migration.

25
00:02:08,155 --> 00:02:10,945
So this was about careful.

26
00:02:12,985 --> 00:02:18,954
12.5 million customers counts
ensuring that with minimal disruption.

27
00:02:20,425 --> 00:02:26,325
And the third one, actually this we knew
that our, any slip up would impact trust.

28
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:31,135
And in banking we know
that trust is everything.

29
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:34,765
So the third one is the implementation.

30
00:02:36,565 --> 00:02:37,405
Here we.

31
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:46,120
Cloud native architecture and
API first principles unlocking

32
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,560
agility and scalability.

33
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,580
So finally is optimization.

34
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,400
So the transformation did
not stop once we went live,

35
00:02:59,525 --> 00:03:04,810
so we committed to a cycle of
continuous improvement, fine tuning

36
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,180
processes, measuring outcomes.

37
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,401
And iterating for.

38
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:18,700
So each phase we built on the previous
one leading us to a stable, scalable,

39
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,670
and customer focused platform.

40
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,590
So let's see.

41
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,230
The legacy challenge is here.

42
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,190
So

43
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,590
let's our starting point.

44
00:03:34,345 --> 00:03:41,005
So our legacy systems had a serious
issues performance, bottlenecks

45
00:03:41,005 --> 00:03:43,915
made transactions sluggish.

46
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:50,270
A 3.2 second delay might not
sound huge, but to a customer use

47
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,870
instant app, it felt painful, slow.

48
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,720
So we had limited
integration capabilities.

49
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,250
Every system was its own line.

50
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:11,230
So without unified customer view,
we could not deliver personalized

51
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,180
service or anticipate needs.

52
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,920
So security was another major problem.

53
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:25,690
Outdated protocols expose us to
compliance risk that regulators would.

54
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:34,545
Finally, maintenance crisis
maintenance pause for skyrocketing.

55
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:41,085
So we needed specialized support
just to keep lights on with

56
00:04:41,085 --> 00:04:43,035
no room for our innovation.

57
00:04:44,565 --> 00:04:49,635
So these challenges weren't
just technical, they directly

58
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:51,255
impacted customer first.

59
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:54,600
He employ more and our.

60
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,720
Comp two position in the market.

61
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,980
So let's see, the next slide, the
technical architecture transformation.

62
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,610
So to follow the about discussed
challenges in the last slide.

63
00:05:12,715 --> 00:05:18,660
So we did not just batch the
old system, we reimagine.

64
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,110
Let's see.

65
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,120
The first one, we adopted a
microservices architecture.

66
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:32,830
So instead of used monolithic
applications, we built small

67
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:39,550
independent services that could be
developed and deployed separately.

68
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,560
So next we move on to
the cloud infrastructure.

69
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,340
Scaling resources up or down
dynamically, depending on the

70
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,130
load, without over provisioning.

71
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,060
And next hour is our API first design
created, standardized, reusable

72
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:07,870
interfaces that made integration with both
internal and external systems, seamless.

73
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,530
And we everything with.

74
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:19,100
Assuming nothing inside or outside
was worthy until proven otherwise.

75
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,590
So this combination give us
the flexibility, resilience,

76
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,220
callability, and top-notch security.

77
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,940
So let's move on to the next slide,
is the performance improvements.

78
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,310
So let's see the results here.

79
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,300
So the transaction processing speed.

80
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:50,450
Drop by 75 percentage from 3.2
seconds to the just 0.8 seconds.

81
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:57,020
So our platforms processing
capability, capacity, surge by that

82
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:03,140
300 percentage easily by handling
over 2.3 million transactions day.

83
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,250
So through the migration.

84
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,480
And beyond.

85
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:14,330
We achieved 99.999 percentage uptime.

86
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:20,390
So thinking about that virtually,
there was no downtime at all

87
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,040
during the complete platform.

88
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:29,325
So our system downtime across
18 months was just 0.01%.

89
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:37,705
It came from deliverable deliber rate
design, constant monitoring, and a culture

90
00:07:39,115 --> 00:07:41,815
of continuous testing and improvement.

91
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:50,365
So it showed our customers they could
trust the new system, and it gave

92
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:57,955
our teams confidence to keep the
innovating customer experience impact.

93
00:07:59,755 --> 00:08:05,575
So now you can imagine customers
notice the difference immediately.

94
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:15,930
So our customer satisfaction score
here it's climbed from 52 percentage

95
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,780
after modernization our net.

96
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,520
It's an indicator how likely
customers are to recommend us.

97
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,619
This was Rose, rose dramatically
from 28 to the 52 percentage.

98
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,670
So our mobile app ratings
also improved here.

99
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:42,100
This is an from average
3.4 stars to the 0.7 stars.

100
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,000
We like this new experience
with this statistic, so even

101
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,530
better customer retention here.

102
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,240
So the ultimate proof of
satisfaction jumped from the 76

103
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,910
percentage to the 92 percentage.

104
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:04,735
So in banking where switching
costs or high, but competition.

105
00:09:06,465 --> 00:09:07,790
So that's a use gain.

106
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:09,405
So the.

107
00:09:10,405 --> 00:09:16,495
They were the reflection of how much
value we had unlocked for our customers.

108
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:19,615
So let's move on to the next slide.

109
00:09:20,485 --> 00:09:22,825
Accelerated customer onboarding.

110
00:09:25,285 --> 00:09:31,615
So one area where transformation
made a massive difference

111
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:33,835
was customer onboarding.

112
00:09:35,245 --> 00:09:36,745
So before modernization.

113
00:09:39,085 --> 00:09:48,865
Opening a new account took 48 hours, so
multiple branch visits, manual document

114
00:09:48,865 --> 00:09:52,045
verification, overnight batch cycles.

115
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:57,565
So as part of our intermediate
improvements, we introduced

116
00:09:57,565 --> 00:10:02,365
the partial automation and the
digital document upload, cutting

117
00:10:02,365 --> 00:10:04,345
the process to about four hours.

118
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,500
But the real game change came
with a full modernization.

119
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:17,290
Today a customer can open a new account
within 15 minutes, a fully digital

120
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:24,725
biometric verification, AI driven in
KY ctr, in intent account provisioning.

121
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:31,475
This streamline process lead to a
70 27 percentage increase in new

122
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:33,695
account openings providing that.

123
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,580
Frictionle experiences
drive real business world.

124
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,690
So in the in business growth.

125
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:48,170
So let's see, the next slide,
enhance regulatory compliance.

126
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,870
So let's see.

127
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:55,860
The compliance has always been
critical in financial services.

128
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,460
We all know.

129
00:10:57,285 --> 00:11:01,095
When regulators are the only
are only getting its sector.

130
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:02,205
So let's see.

131
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:07,695
The before transformation and the opta
transformation, what was the changes here?

132
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:15,855
So before modernization, we relied on
manual compliance check and reactive

133
00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:20,415
monitoring our compliance rate over.

134
00:11:21,675 --> 00:11:28,305
Around 97.5 percentage, which
sounds okay, but until you

135
00:11:28,305 --> 00:11:30,105
realize it means the real risk.

136
00:11:30,105 --> 00:11:36,465
Slipping through audit preparations
took year, two weeks consuming,

137
00:11:36,515 --> 00:11:42,485
tons of internal resources and, but
whereas a post transformation, it

138
00:11:42,485 --> 00:11:44,805
took it's it here, compliance is.

139
00:11:47,475 --> 00:11:52,275
So we have continuous monitoring
and real time altering.

140
00:11:53,115 --> 00:11:57,195
Our compliance rate shoot
up 99.99 percentage.

141
00:11:58,995 --> 00:12:01,965
And audit preparation now
takes only just three days.

142
00:12:03,605 --> 00:12:08,795
And more importantly, our teams can
spend more time in strengthening

143
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:12,285
the operations instead of,
scrambling to checkbox as well.

144
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:15,225
So let's see the, our next slide.

145
00:12:16,225 --> 00:12:17,815
Migration success metric.

146
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:23,845
The migration itself was a huge
endeavor and a huge success.

147
00:12:24,805 --> 00:12:30,755
We moved to 1.5 million customer
customer accounts to a new system

148
00:12:31,385 --> 00:12:33,155
without a single data loss.

149
00:12:34,475 --> 00:12:38,045
We read the redesign and optimize.

150
00:12:38,855 --> 00:12:44,915
8 43 critical banking processes to run
on the cloud native infrastructure.

151
00:12:46,895 --> 00:12:52,535
So testing was in a comprehensive
year, 1.2 million automated test

152
00:12:52,595 --> 00:12:59,965
cases covering 98.7 percentage of the
platform and deployments that used

153
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:03,505
to take 72 percentage no, 72 hours.

154
00:13:04,965 --> 00:13:06,735
Full weekend of downtime.

155
00:13:07,005 --> 00:13:13,635
Now just take just 25 minutes with
the continuous in, with continuous

156
00:13:13,635 --> 00:13:15,845
integrations and continuous deployments.

157
00:13:17,345 --> 00:13:22,115
So this wasn't just a technology
upgrade, it was a fundamental

158
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:28,055
change in how we operated, tested
and delivered banking services.

159
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:33,715
So let's move on to the next
slide employee adoption strategy.

160
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:39,865
So node transformation succeeds
without the people behind it.

161
00:13:41,635 --> 00:13:46,285
So our employee adoption strategy
focus first on the awareness.

162
00:13:48,265 --> 00:13:51,625
Make sure everyone understood that.

163
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:53,275
Why behind this chain.

164
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:00,490
So we launched the communication
campaigns to explain not just what was

165
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:07,750
changing, but how it could, would make
employees work easier and more rewarding.

166
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,440
Training programs.

167
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,080
We gave teams to an experience with.

168
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,070
Dedicated support teams were
available to troubleshoot issues

169
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,390
during the LA transformation,
the early transition stage.

170
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:30,590
And crucially, we kept optimizing
the platform based on the employee

171
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,170
feedback, not just the technical scale.

172
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:40,250
So as a result, we achieved the
89 percentage of stock adoption

173
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,660
within just three months.

174
00:14:42,935 --> 00:14:46,115
Yeah, using forever
transformation of this scale.

175
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:51,700
So let's see the next slide
the cost optimization results.

176
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:59,410
So financially the transformation
more than justified itself.

177
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:05,040
So infrastructure cost fell
down by 42 percentage thanks to

178
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,900
the cloud optimization and the
maintenance expenses are dropped by.

179
00:15:10,815 --> 00:15:11,685
58 percentage.

180
00:15:11,805 --> 00:15:18,495
Because of the automation and the simpler
architectures, we slashed a third party

181
00:15:18,615 --> 00:15:26,295
licensing cost by 37 percentage by
consolidating vendors and using open

182
00:15:26,295 --> 00:15:28,455
source solutions wherever is possible.

183
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:35,505
And the development time for new
features decrease 58 percentage

184
00:15:36,105 --> 00:15:37,545
letting us innovation to.

185
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:44,050
Letting us innovation faster and
supporting ticket fell down by 72

186
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:49,480
percentage showing that better systems
lead to the fewer problems overall.

187
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:56,200
The operations expenses dropped by
the 35 percentage, so that free up

188
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,210
investment for future innovation.

189
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,080
And what is improvement?

190
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:03,210
See.

191
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,930
Then the next slide is
integration strategy.

192
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:11,750
So here, integration was a
major pillar for our success.

193
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:18,790
So we built an API Gateway, gateway
layer that unified access to all

194
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,570
services, all and new in a standardized.

195
00:16:24,305 --> 00:16:28,235
Now either service mesh, manage the
service to service communication

196
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,415
securely inside the cloud native.

197
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:41,160
And our data integration layer ensure
consistent access to legacy and the modern

198
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,695
systems like, and our security framework.

199
00:16:45,845 --> 00:16:46,655
Across the board.

200
00:16:48,335 --> 00:16:53,735
So this approach let us modernize
gradually without forcing an

201
00:16:53,735 --> 00:16:58,985
overnight cutover, reducing
risk, preserving continuity, and

202
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,755
giving the teams time to adopt.

203
00:17:02,945 --> 00:17:06,055
So let's see the risk mitigation
techniques we can discuss here.

204
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:08,240
What are the risks we are seeing?

205
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,490
We knew the transformation at.

206
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,400
And we address them around.

207
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:19,200
So we ran parallel systems with
synchronized data to ensure

208
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,150
no service interruptions.

209
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:26,250
So Canary deployment allowed
us to test new features with

210
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,295
small percentage of profit.

211
00:17:28,295 --> 00:17:32,670
First, ensuring the confidence
before people rollout.

212
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,150
So the rollback capabilities mean.

213
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,590
That if anything went wrong, we
could revert changes in, instantly

214
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,140
without impacting the customers.

215
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,300
So the realtime monitoring, monitoring
across performance, security,

216
00:17:50,785 --> 00:17:56,685
and system health enabled past
dimension and resolution of issues.

217
00:17:58,005 --> 00:18:02,435
And the cross functional teams
bringing together a technical business

218
00:18:02,435 --> 00:18:08,465
and compliance experts to ensure
a 360 degree view of every risk.

219
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:11,145
So let's move on to the next slide.

220
00:18:11,195 --> 00:18:13,295
The key takeaways and the next step.

221
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:18,790
First, a comprehensive strategy,
aligning technical, organizational,

222
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:24,010
and customer goal is essential
for any successful transformation.

223
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:30,460
So second the critical to balance
innovation with stability.

224
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:34,945
So evaluation, not
evaluation in ecosystems.

225
00:18:35,805 --> 00:18:37,065
So here the.

226
00:18:38,065 --> 00:18:44,785
Each one prioritize the change
management just as much as technology

227
00:18:44,845 --> 00:18:50,185
upgrades, because adoption and
drivers drives the real results.

228
00:18:51,445 --> 00:18:55,285
Now the fourth one is
abra API first design.

229
00:18:56,245 --> 00:19:00,745
It's your gateway to future ecosystems
and open banking innovations.

230
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:08,235
So our journey shows that legacy
systems can be modernized successfully

231
00:19:08,235 --> 00:19:11,745
at scale without losing capability.

232
00:19:12,315 --> 00:19:18,465
Now we are pushing forward into AI
driven personalization, deeper open

233
00:19:18,465 --> 00:19:22,085
banking integrations and ER analytics.

234
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,695
So this all about Thank you.

235
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:31,715
All for your time and attention today.

236
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:38,315
I hope our story showed that with
the right strategy and execution,

237
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:43,685
even more complex legacy systems
can be transformed successfully.

238
00:19:44,945 --> 00:19:49,920
So modernization isn't just about
the technology, it's about empowering

239
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,405
and improving customer experiences.

240
00:19:54,405 --> 00:19:59,415
We are excited to explore ai,
open banking and new innovations

241
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,295
built on our modern platform.

242
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:08,465
So I had love to connect and discuss
how these ideas could apply to

243
00:20:08,465 --> 00:20:10,235
your own transformation journey.

244
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:17,615
