00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,750
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:04,330
Welcome to Con 42, DevOps 2025 conference.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,950
I am Sandeep Bajju, and I bring over
a decade of experience in building and

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,170
securing cloud and hybrid platforms.

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,049
One of the most pressing topics
in tech today is the cloud

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,820
infrastructure security, how it's
transforming industries and the

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,080
unique security challenges it brings.

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,270
I'm excited to share some of
the innovative Cloud security

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,330
strategies that tackle these
challenges and help secure the cloud.

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,350
Let's dive in and make the
most of this exciting session.

11
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:41,210
Just a disclaimer, the presentation slides
information I shared today represent

12
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:47,339
my own personal views and speaking for
myself and not on behalf of my employer.

13
00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:50,795
So now let's talk about
the cloud driven future.

14
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:57,095
By 2025, 75 percent of the enterprise
data will be created and processed

15
00:00:57,175 --> 00:01:02,154
in the cloud, enabling the real time
insights and accelerating digital

16
00:01:02,154 --> 00:01:04,285
transformation across the industries.

17
00:01:04,854 --> 00:01:10,265
As the cloud adoption is increasing,
94 percent of the enterprises are

18
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:15,140
already leveraging cloud services,
such as driving, Cost optimization,

19
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,759
scalability, and business agility.

20
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,710
So, the cloud adoption is becoming a
core pillar for competitive advantage

21
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,840
and operational resiliencies.

22
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,850
So, as adoption increases,
so as the cyber attacks.

23
00:01:31,059 --> 00:01:36,260
So, organizations face thousands
of cyber attacks on average daily.

24
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:41,899
So the strengthening of cloud
security and implementing the advanced

25
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,700
threat detection are critical for
protecting the sensitive data.

26
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,920
What exactly is the
Zero Trust architecture?

27
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:56,440
You know, Zero Trust assumes all users
and devices are untrusted by default.

28
00:01:57,215 --> 00:02:02,785
So, the continuous verification and
contextual access control ensures

29
00:02:02,825 --> 00:02:09,165
security at every point of access,
whether it's internal or external.

30
00:02:09,995 --> 00:02:15,945
Some of the important models are,
trust nothing, verify everything.

31
00:02:15,945 --> 00:02:23,640
So, if we take the multi factor
authentication, or Risk, real time risk

32
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,200
analysis, or identity access management.

33
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:33,430
All these systems continuously verify
every access request, ensuring that

34
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:37,060
only authorized entities gain access.

35
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,290
Next is the continuous authentication,
which is an ongoing process based on user

36
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:50,875
behavior, device health, location, which
is like adapting in real time to changes.

37
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:57,135
This is like a dynamic approach which
prevents unauthorized access post login.

38
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:02,604
We can talk about the micro segmentation
which is more like isolating the systems

39
00:03:02,605 --> 00:03:08,740
into the smaller segments using techniques
like VLANs, Software Defined Networks,

40
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:14,860
Network Access Controls, ensuring that
least privileged principle and granular

41
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:21,089
control over data flows, and reducing
the, you know, lateral movement in the

42
00:03:21,089 --> 00:03:23,279
event of a breach or attack vector.

43
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:29,559
When we talk about the advanced
IAM methods, This is nothing but an

44
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:31,549
identity access management methods.

45
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:36,269
There are multiple authentication methods
out there which are like single sign

46
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:40,769
on, certificate based authentication,
passwordless authentication, token

47
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:43,679
based authentication, hardware tokens.

48
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:49,409
And some of the commonly used
mechanisms are Biometric authentication,

49
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:55,229
which leverages the unique physical
traits like fingerprints, facial

50
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:57,849
recognitions to enhance the security.

51
00:03:58,509 --> 00:04:02,629
You know, combined with encryption
and machine learning algorithms,

52
00:04:02,649 --> 00:04:06,949
the biometrics offer a high level
of fraud resistance and accuracy.

53
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:11,979
Next is the multi factor authentication,
which requires multiple forms

54
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:14,709
of verification like password.

55
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:20,274
One time code, you know, which provides
a multi layer defense, making it

56
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:26,974
harder for attackers to access accounts
and move laterally within systems.

57
00:04:27,474 --> 00:04:33,564
Next is the adaptive access policy, which
is like a real time context aware policies

58
00:04:33,864 --> 00:04:39,264
which dynamically adjust authentication
requirements based on, you know, user

59
00:04:39,264 --> 00:04:41,904
behavior, device security, and location.

60
00:04:42,434 --> 00:04:47,834
optimizing the security, you know, without
compromising the usability of the systems.

61
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:55,164
Next is how we can leverage the AI and
ML in the cloud security, which is by

62
00:04:55,174 --> 00:05:01,574
using AI driven threat detection, which
can process millions of security events

63
00:05:01,604 --> 00:05:07,344
per second, you know, which enables the
identification of some of the important

64
00:05:07,344 --> 00:05:11,044
or attacks like zero day vulnerabilities.

65
00:05:11,774 --> 00:05:16,444
ransomware attacks, you know,
which helps in responding 50 times

66
00:05:16,444 --> 00:05:18,414
faster than traditional methods.

67
00:05:19,304 --> 00:05:23,204
Next, for the behavior analytics,
you know, we can leverage the machine

68
00:05:23,204 --> 00:05:29,364
learning, which can continuously monitor
user activities, which helps in creating

69
00:05:29,364 --> 00:05:31,864
that baseline behavior profiles.

70
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:38,529
so, which helps in, identifying the
anomalies like, accessing the sensitive

71
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:43,489
data from unusual locations, you know,
trigger instant alerts to prevent

72
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:45,929
insider threats and account takeovers.

73
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:51,249
We can also use the AI based
security tools, which can reduce

74
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:56,389
false positives up to 50 percent
as compared to the traditional

75
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,449
signature based security systems.

76
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,089
which allows, you know, security
teams to focus on the real threats,

77
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:07,889
improving the response time and
also the operational efficiency.

78
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:13,899
And, you know, we, how, next we talk
about like how we can leverage some of

79
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:16,709
the quantum resistant encryption methods.

80
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:23,599
Yeah, you know, like pulse quantum
algorithms, which counter the potential of

81
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:32,539
quantum computers breaking the classical
cryptographies like RSA, ECC, post quantum

82
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:39,239
algorithms which leverages problems
that quantum systems can't solve easily,

83
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:45,709
such as like lattice based cryptography,
multivariate quadratic equations.

84
00:06:46,274 --> 00:06:51,354
So if you are looking at an NIST
approved algorithms, which ensures the

85
00:06:51,354 --> 00:06:56,944
robust quantum resistant encryption,
which provides, future proof protection

86
00:06:56,984 --> 00:07:03,144
against the quantum threats, which is
more powerful than current systems.

87
00:07:03,974 --> 00:07:07,564
We can also look at the hybrid
cryptography method, which is like

88
00:07:07,614 --> 00:07:13,664
integrating the traditional RSA or ECC
methods with lattice based cryptography.

89
00:07:14,164 --> 00:07:17,304
which creates a dual
layer encryption model.

90
00:07:17,784 --> 00:07:22,314
So this approach provides the
backward compatibility with

91
00:07:22,534 --> 00:07:28,334
existing systems while preparing
organizations for the quantum era.

92
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:33,974
So the hybrid cryptography facilitates
a smooth transition without

93
00:07:33,984 --> 00:07:36,324
disrupting the legacy encryption.

94
00:07:37,194 --> 00:07:43,174
We can also use the key management
method Which is like leveraging the

95
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:48,284
advanced hardware security models,
you know, like HSMs, which are

96
00:07:48,294 --> 00:07:54,244
basically a cryptographic key, which
were like basically a cryptographic

97
00:07:54,414 --> 00:07:59,894
keys are stored securely with 256
bit entropies for robust randomness.

98
00:08:00,694 --> 00:08:05,664
Automated key rotations and zero knowledge
proofs, you know, which provides the

99
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:11,574
additional layer of security, ensuring
that data remains protected even in

100
00:08:11,594 --> 00:08:15,114
the face of quantum computing advances.

101
00:08:15,854 --> 00:08:20,284
Cryptographic agility, which is basically
like allowing the quick adaption.

102
00:08:20,784 --> 00:08:26,844
to evolving threats by enabling rapid
updates to the encryption algorithms.

103
00:08:26,854 --> 00:08:33,894
So this agility ensures that even as
quantum computing grows, organizations

104
00:08:34,004 --> 00:08:40,294
can transition seamlessly to the,
seamlessly to post quantum algorithms

105
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:44,724
without system downtime or security risks.

106
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:48,034
Next, we can talk about
like how we can leverage.

107
00:08:48,534 --> 00:08:53,874
or how we can integrate blockchain
into the cloud security.

108
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:59,694
One is using the immutable logging,
which uses blockchain's distributed

109
00:08:59,694 --> 00:09:04,474
ledger, ensures that, you know,
the security logs are tamper proof,

110
00:09:04,564 --> 00:09:11,944
providing immutable, verifiable
records for all the cloud activities.

111
00:09:12,284 --> 00:09:17,889
Once a data is Once a data is stored,
you know, it cannot be altered,

112
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,789
you know, ensuring a transparent
audit trail for detecting and

113
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:25,179
investigating security incidents.

114
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:27,179
Next is the smart contracts.

115
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:33,679
So, smart contracts can automate
security policy enforcement, which

116
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,829
includes the access control, encryption
standards, and data sharing rules.

117
00:09:38,154 --> 00:09:43,954
So they verify conditions like, you know,
device health, locations, credentials

118
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:46,894
before granting or denying access.

119
00:09:47,244 --> 00:09:52,694
So if these are executed on a
blockchain, they ensure the policies

120
00:09:52,694 --> 00:09:56,454
are transparent and tamper resistant.

121
00:09:57,134 --> 00:10:03,064
Next, we can look at the decentralized
identity, which puts users in

122
00:10:03,094 --> 00:10:04,724
control of the personal data.

123
00:10:05,224 --> 00:10:09,554
where the data is stored in a
secured, distributed ledger.

124
00:10:09,954 --> 00:10:14,664
So, which is like cryptographically
verified identities, which ensures

125
00:10:14,734 --> 00:10:21,314
only authorized parties can access
this sensitive information, reducing

126
00:10:21,314 --> 00:10:26,164
the centralized data breach risk and
also prevents the identity theft.

127
00:10:26,664 --> 00:10:31,804
So some of the micro segmentation
strategies are network mapping, which

128
00:10:31,824 --> 00:10:38,114
helps organization gain a comprehensive
understanding of their infrastructure.

129
00:10:38,794 --> 00:10:44,344
By identifying and categorizing these
assets and traffic flows, network mapping

130
00:10:44,364 --> 00:10:50,237
ensures that security vulnerabilities
are identified, threats are mitigated,

131
00:10:50,237 --> 00:10:53,659
and performance is optimized.

132
00:10:54,109 --> 00:10:59,209
We can also look at the policy creation
which helps defining the granular

133
00:10:59,669 --> 00:11:02,609
security rules for each segment.

134
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:09,299
Policies like least privileged access
ensures that users, devices, and

135
00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:16,819
applications only have access to essential
resources like securing sensitive data

136
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:19,469
and ensuring the regulatory compliance.

137
00:11:19,969 --> 00:11:24,159
We can look at the segmentation
implementation, which divides networks

138
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:30,039
into smaller and isolated zones, so
ensuring the data is protected even if an

139
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:34,969
attack will compromise one of the segments
like VLAN and software defined networks

140
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:41,379
or network access controls, which enforce
strict communication policies between

141
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:46,379
these segments, so preventing the lateral
movement and reducing the attack surface.

142
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:52,989
We can also implement continuous
monitoring, which ensures that all

143
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:55,559
segments are secure and compliant.

144
00:11:55,989 --> 00:12:01,349
This will help systems detect suspicious
activities and potential breaches,

145
00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:07,569
providing continuous feedback to
adjust segmentations and also improve

146
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:11,429
security posture as new threats emerge.

147
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:17,949
Next is the serverless architecture,
which offers scalability and cost

148
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:25,259
efficiency, while it represents a unique
challenge in securing dynamic FML, you

149
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:32,179
know, securing dynamic FML components
like functions, APIs, and even triggers.

150
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:38,179
So securing these components involves
creating a model that address the

151
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:41,159
absence of underlying infrastructure.

152
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:46,099
So making the traditional security
approaches difficult to apply.

153
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,379
If you are looking at the functional
level security, which is composed

154
00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:55,969
of stateless, isolated functions,
which gets triggered by events.

155
00:12:56,179 --> 00:13:02,509
So securing them involves applying
granular IAM policies, least

156
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,439
privilege access, and also the
RPAC to restrict resource access.

157
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:14,499
So the best practices such as like input
validation, output encoding, and also the,

158
00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:20,389
you know, function isolation, minimizing
the risk like injection attacks.

159
00:13:20,714 --> 00:13:25,994
Okay, so for multifunction
environment, ensure that breaches

160
00:13:25,994 --> 00:13:31,874
in one function don't lead to that,
that important lateral movement.

161
00:13:32,744 --> 00:13:35,204
Next is the API Gateway production.

162
00:13:35,894 --> 00:13:40,394
So the API gateway is like an entry
point to the serverless functions.

163
00:13:40,394 --> 00:13:46,124
You know, securing it requires strong
authentications, like AU or API, keys

164
00:13:46,124 --> 00:13:49,724
and, and authorization to control access.

165
00:13:50,369 --> 00:13:57,989
So we can also do additionally like rate
looting or throttling, which prevents

166
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:04,109
the DDoS attacks while integrating a
WAF, which is like a web application

167
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:09,859
firewall, which protects against
vulnerabilities such as SQL injections.

168
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:16,349
So the monitoring the API traffic, which
helps in enabling the quick detection

169
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:22,969
of suspicious, suspicious patterns and
also the unauthorized access attempts.

170
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:28,819
Next is the event driven, which
are triggered by actions like

171
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:33,829
HTTP request or, you know, file
uploads or database changes.

172
00:14:34,469 --> 00:14:40,699
You know, the security involves like
applying policies that responds to these

173
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:48,319
event driven activities in real time,
such as like logging, data encryption, or,

174
00:14:48,849 --> 00:14:51,189
you know, alleging on abnormal behavior.

175
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:56,739
Anomaly detection can be done using
the machine learning, which can

176
00:14:56,809 --> 00:15:01,764
identify the patterns of the potential
attacks like You know, function

177
00:15:01,774 --> 00:15:04,814
triggered by the unrecognized source.

178
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:10,774
You know, events can be monitored and also
the policy thresholds can be set to block

179
00:15:10,774 --> 00:15:14,194
the malicious activity before execution.

180
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:20,164
Next is the, you know, these serverless
functions often rely on external

181
00:15:20,184 --> 00:15:25,494
libraries or services which can introduce
vulnerabilities, which is nothing but

182
00:15:25,544 --> 00:15:27,734
a third party dependency scanning.

183
00:15:28,274 --> 00:15:34,484
So we can do the continuous scanning
of these dependencies, ensuring that

184
00:15:34,484 --> 00:15:37,744
vulnerabilities are detected and patched.

185
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,629
Like tools like Static Analysis or
Dependency Scanners, which automatically

186
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:49,699
assess the health of the third party
code and identifying the outdated or

187
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:57,219
insecure libraries and also preventing
vulnerabilities from being incorporated

188
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:59,559
into your serverless ecosystem.

189
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:05,409
Next is how we can use the
continuous compliance automation.

190
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:11,619
So, automating the compliance ensures
that organizations consistency,

191
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:17,309
I mean like consistently adhere
to all the regulatory frameworks

192
00:16:17,989 --> 00:16:21,299
without relying on manual audits.

193
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:28,439
So, by leveraging the automated tools and
cloud native services, we Organizations

194
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:34,699
can maintain compliance at scale and
also in real time, by reducing the manual

195
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:37,279
errors and also the audit overhead.

196
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:41,819
So the automated compliance, which
is nothing but like starts with

197
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:47,229
defining the policies which align
with the specific regulations

198
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:49,659
of the organization or industry.

199
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:55,009
You know, these policies are
translated into machine readable rules.

200
00:16:55,529 --> 00:17:00,129
which can be integrated into
infrastructure as a code templates

201
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:04,659
and also the cloud configurations,
you know, compliance parameters

202
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:09,919
include like data encryption, access
controls, system configurations.

203
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:17,709
So, so up by automating all this
policy enforcement eliminates the

204
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:23,179
human error and also ensures the
consistent adherence to the security.

205
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,359
and also to the regulatory requirements.

206
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:31,569
We can also use the real time
compliance monitoring which scans

207
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:38,029
systems for policy violations or
deviations from regulatory standards.

208
00:17:38,459 --> 00:17:43,739
So using the AI driven analytics
and cloud native monitoring tools,

209
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:51,219
organizations can track, you know, changes
in system configuration, user access.

210
00:17:51,899 --> 00:17:55,569
data patterns, you know, this
enables the immediate detection

211
00:17:55,569 --> 00:18:01,869
of issues like unencrypted data,
unauthorized access or vulnerable

212
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:06,099
systems, you know, which ensures a
proactive approach to the compliance.

213
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:13,759
And also the automated remediation,
which helps in detecting a compliance

214
00:18:13,979 --> 00:18:20,544
violation or You know, also automated
remediation systems, you know, initiate

215
00:18:20,544 --> 00:18:26,114
the corrective actions such as reversing
the configurations or applying patches

216
00:18:26,114 --> 00:18:30,034
or restoring the access control settings.

217
00:18:30,104 --> 00:18:36,054
You know, if you are integrating
this with your CI, CDE,

218
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:38,239
Workflows or pipelines, right?

219
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:42,419
Which enables the continuous
compliance during the development,

220
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:44,099
testing, and production cycles.

221
00:18:44,939 --> 00:18:51,559
This also helps in reducing the response
times and ensures that violations are

222
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:59,359
addressed before they escalate, minimizing
the risk of penalties or data breaches.

223
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:06,729
Automated tools can generate real
time compliance reports that provide

224
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:13,159
detailed, accurate overview of the
security configurations, patching it,

225
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:16,809
history, and also the, policy adherence.

226
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:23,789
So these reports are like the audit ready
and which can be generated on demand

227
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:26,279
to simplify the regulatory assessment.

228
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:31,669
So they offer pretty much like a
transparency and provide a comprehensive

229
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:37,099
record of actions which can be taken
to achieve and maintain compliance.

230
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:42,049
So that's streamlining the audit
process and also reducing the

231
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:44,629
workload of the compliance issues.

232
00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:51,049
So some of the key initiatives are like
embracing the Zero Trust architecture.

233
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:55,289
You know, in Zero Trust model,
as we said earlier, no entity is

234
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:59,179
trusted by default, whether it's
inside or outside of the network.

235
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:06,429
So the identity centric approach, which
ensures that all requests, whether

236
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:12,674
from users, devices, or applications,
right, are Everything is authenticated,

237
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:15,294
authorized, and continuously verified.

238
00:20:15,794 --> 00:20:21,424
So the principle of least privilege
access, which ensures that only

239
00:20:21,594 --> 00:20:27,024
necessary resources are granted, you
know, minimizing the attack surface.

240
00:20:27,584 --> 00:20:33,834
So to implement Zero Trust Organizations
must apply some of the strategies

241
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:36,319
like multi factor authentication.

242
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:40,909
Role-based access controls,
microsegmentation and continuous

243
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:47,829
monitoring that ensures every in
interaction is validated and locked.

244
00:20:48,329 --> 00:20:52,979
Next is leveraging the
AI and ML capabilities.

245
00:20:52,979 --> 00:21:00,239
So AI and machine listening are, you
know, rev revolutionizing the security by

246
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,839
enabling the predictive threat detections.

247
00:21:04,544 --> 00:21:09,384
You know, by analyzing the, the
large data sets in real time.

248
00:21:09,674 --> 00:21:16,194
So these technologies can identify
anomalous patterns or potential

249
00:21:16,224 --> 00:21:18,564
threats even before they occur.

250
00:21:19,164 --> 00:21:25,744
So the behavior analytics powered
by AI can spot insider threats.

251
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:31,384
You know, it also detect deviations
from normal user behavior.

252
00:21:31,984 --> 00:21:36,334
improving the detection rates and
also reducing the false positive.

253
00:21:37,124 --> 00:21:42,494
The ML model also assists in some of
these machine learning models, right?

254
00:21:42,514 --> 00:21:47,034
It also assists in automating,
vulnerability identification and

255
00:21:47,034 --> 00:21:53,094
also the incident response, which
helps security teams to stay one

256
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:55,814
step ahead of all these attackers.

257
00:21:56,474 --> 00:22:00,554
And Nexus, you know, preparing for
quantum computing threats, you know.

258
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:05,914
It's like future proof your
infrastructure, guys, by implementing the

259
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:12,614
quantum resistant encryption protocols
and also maintaining, the crypto

260
00:22:13,204 --> 00:22:15,344
isolity in your security frameworks.

261
00:22:15,844 --> 00:22:19,864
Also, automate the compliance process.

262
00:22:19,894 --> 00:22:26,104
We have to streamline the security
operations by implementing the continuous

263
00:22:26,134 --> 00:22:31,144
compliance automations, which helps in
reducing the human errors and also ensures

264
00:22:31,174 --> 00:22:36,424
that, you know, in real time, it adheres
to all the regulatory requirements.

265
00:22:37,294 --> 00:22:43,484
So with this, I would like to reiterate,
I would like to Retreat and conclude

266
00:22:43,484 --> 00:22:50,554
that some of the key takeaways to off,
you know, it's more like offering a

267
00:22:50,554 --> 00:22:56,164
road map to help your organization
stay ahead of evolving security

268
00:22:56,174 --> 00:23:00,854
threats, you know, is to fall and
also the compliance challenges, right?

269
00:23:00,855 --> 00:23:06,555
is to follow all this emerging
technologies like quantum computing

270
00:23:06,915 --> 00:23:09,555
and also by taking proactive steps.

271
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,640
Where you can build a more
resilient, adaptive, and future

272
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,550
proof security infrastructure.

273
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:23,750
Everyone, you know, thanks for your
time for attending this presentation.
