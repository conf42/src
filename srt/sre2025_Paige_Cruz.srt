1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
Hey there.

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:06,390
I'm Paige Cruz, a former SRE, current
open source observability advocate at

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,270
K Chronosphere and Forever Bravo Holic.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,800
Now, today I'm sharing how the Real
Housewives have taught me valuable

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,970
lessons about running effective
postmortems, and even understanding

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,130
the nature of reality itself.

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,270
Let's dive in.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,950
For those unfamiliar the Real
Housewives follows groups of

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,790
affluent women in different cities
as they navigate relationships,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,160
businesses, and social lives.

11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:37,655
Now what makes Reality TV fascinating
to me is how it reflects the multiple

12
00:00:37,655 --> 00:00:43,025
layers in perspectives on reality
from the housewives themselves to the

13
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:46,295
producers, and even us as viewers at home.

14
00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:51,725
My central argument today is that the
power of an effective postmortem, like

15
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:57,395
a productive Housewives reunion isn't
about establishing the objective truth.

16
00:00:57,895 --> 00:01:02,605
It's about engaging with multiple,
valid, incomplete, and yeah, sometimes

17
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:06,955
competing perspectives to uncover
deeper insights about our system,

18
00:01:07,135 --> 00:01:09,055
our responses, and ourselves.

19
00:01:09,475 --> 00:01:12,925
Now, there are plenty of ways
to adapt traditional postmortem

20
00:01:12,925 --> 00:01:17,005
templates and meetings approaches
accordingly, which I'll be sharing.

21
00:01:17,505 --> 00:01:22,245
But really the genesis of this talk
really came to mind while I was

22
00:01:22,305 --> 00:01:24,945
rewatching Beverly Hills season one.

23
00:01:25,395 --> 00:01:30,325
There was a typical she said,
situation between Kyle and Camille.

24
00:01:30,805 --> 00:01:31,615
Kyle claims.

25
00:01:31,615 --> 00:01:35,395
She simply asked, why would
they film you solo in Hawaii?

26
00:01:35,755 --> 00:01:38,095
Camille claims that Kyle asked.

27
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:45,250
This question instead, why would they be
interested in filming you without Kelsey?

28
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,740
Kelsey Grammar her celebrity husband.

29
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,860
Both women remained convinced of
their interpretations as the truth

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,550
of what happened, and each filtered
the conversation through their own

31
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,900
context and, mental model and biases.

32
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,940
The kicker, this conversation
happened off camera, off mic, so

33
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,070
there was no objective evidence.

34
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,610
And fans often try to
decide who was right.

35
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,660
Was Camille Insecure about being
in her celebrity husband, shadow,

36
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,390
and thus Prime to hear dismissal?

37
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,130
Was Kyle familiar with production
logistics, having grown up on Hollywood

38
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,270
sets and genuinely was curious
about practical filming concerns?

39
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:30,130
What made this conflict illuminating,
both during the season and at

40
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,720
the reunion where they rehashed.

41
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,650
This was how it revealed the
underlying dynamics and motivations.

42
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,150
Camille was feeling vulnerable as
her marriage was ending, and Kyle is

43
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:44,350
always concerned about her position of
security within the friend group, and

44
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,640
it was really seeing how their different
backgrounds and perspectives created

45
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,650
this perfect communication storm.

46
00:02:51,295 --> 00:02:55,525
And those insights were only able to
emerge by giving both parties space to

47
00:02:55,525 --> 00:03:00,295
share their perspectives rather than
crowning one version as the truth.

48
00:03:00,715 --> 00:03:04,675
So reunions every season ends with
one, and it's where all of the

49
00:03:04,675 --> 00:03:09,595
cast reconvenes to rehash the major
events of the season and address

50
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,815
simmering, unresolved conflicts.

51
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:15,955
And here again, multiple
realities exist simultaneously.

52
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,160
Viewers at home, we see this polished
production with a narrative arc, beginning

53
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,109
with pleasantries diving into the drama
cast member by cast member with carefully

54
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,240
placed commercial breaks at peak tension
moments ending with everybody coming

55
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,500
together, even if they're still holding
onto grudges, but clinking their glasses

56
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,560
and raising a toast to next season.

57
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,010
This is a view that's a little
bit closer to what the Housewives

58
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,450
see during the reunion.

59
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,990
They're split pitted against
each other across two couches.

60
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,650
They're tired from having woken up
at the crack of dawn to get to set,

61
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,690
get into hair, makeup and styling,
sitting for hours under hot lights

62
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,210
with a whole crew directing their
attention, focus, and energy to.

63
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:05,245
Water's gonna be a fairly
dramatic rehashing of events.

64
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:10,765
They're sitting there all knowing that
the next season's contract and continuing

65
00:04:10,765 --> 00:04:15,535
to keep their jobs and cash their
paycheck depends on making a splash.

66
00:04:16,195 --> 00:04:18,115
This mirrors our technical postmortems.

67
00:04:18,294 --> 00:04:21,654
They're the engineers who are
on call remembering the stress

68
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:23,155
and pressure of troubleshooting.

69
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,919
There are engineers who weren't
involved at all and perhaps only

70
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:28,990
see the final post-mortem report.

71
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,000
There are managers focusing on impact
team dynamics and velocity, and as

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,080
always, there are executives who
sometimes misguidedly seek assurance

73
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,240
that this can never happen again.

74
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,030
Despite sharing the same incident,
each person experiences and prioritizes

75
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:50,770
different aspects of the response based on
their roles, focus and responsibilities.

76
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,860
Even our objective evidence, telemetry
data, monitors, dashboards, runbooks,

77
00:04:57,159 --> 00:05:01,240
have already been filtered by what we
collectively decided was important enough

78
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,250
to track, instrument or write down.

79
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,840
Recognizing the validity of these
multiple perspectives is going to

80
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,340
create the foundation for open sharing,
empathy building, and productive

81
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,900
learning, which is exactly what we want
the outcomes of our postmortem to be.

82
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:20,680
So pour yourself, whatever beverage
helps you process this new paradigm.

83
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,549
And let's dive into seven lessons
from The Real Housewives universe

84
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,539
that can transform your postmortems
from reliability theater into

85
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:30,700
valuable learning opportunities.

86
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,620
Lesson one, bring receipts.

87
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:37,645
When a housewife makes a bold claim at a
reunion or during the season, castmates

88
00:05:37,674 --> 00:05:40,765
immediately demand, show me the receipts.

89
00:05:41,064 --> 00:05:45,955
That's evidence like timestamps with
texts, screenshots, or rolling back the

90
00:05:45,955 --> 00:05:51,025
tape to reveal exactly who threw the wine
on whom and at what point in the evening.

91
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:57,480
I have your perfect formula,
receipts, proof, timeline, screenshot.

92
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,460
Everything in that clip, Heather
was accusing a fellow castmate

93
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,040
of being behind an Instagram
account that had been trolling

94
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,840
and harassing the women for years.

95
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,700
Her revelation landed precisely
because her evidence was irrefutable.

96
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:16,280
In SRE, our receipts are more
like monitors, telemetry data

97
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,290
like traces, logs, or metrics.

98
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:24,140
Errors, dashboards, maybe the series
of updates posted to the status page,

99
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,400
all of which are crucial pieces for
reconstructing an incident timeline.

100
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,090
But here's where we should
diverge from the Housewives.

101
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,960
Our evidence shouldn't be kept
secret for a dramatic reveal

102
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,490
or used for a gotcha moment.

103
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,750
I believe that our incident reports
should be a portal allowing anyone

104
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,370
to explore the incident and system
interactions on their own term and time.

105
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,210
Imagine a future engineer who's
really hungry and curious to learn

106
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,990
more about the system, who stumbles
across your incident writeup.

107
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:59,600
How far could they explore and engage
with the data that you have presented?

108
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,330
I'd say if you're providing
a screenshot to a dashboard.

109
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,500
Go ahead and provide a link
that's pinned to the exact time

110
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,360
range for that incident duration.

111
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,060
Allow people to see data.

112
00:07:11,435 --> 00:07:14,045
Get curious and then
follow the breadcrumbs.

113
00:07:14,135 --> 00:07:17,825
It's really powerful to see something
interesting, be able to go review

114
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:21,665
the data, inspect queries, maybe
tinker with aggregations or time

115
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:25,715
windows, and really engage with
this material in a hands-on way.

116
00:07:26,555 --> 00:07:31,775
My other pro tip is to add enough
context and details so that engineers

117
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:36,455
who are outside of your team or
domain area of expertise are able to

118
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:38,560
understand the gist of what happened.

119
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,870
This is all about making your
receipts accessible, not weaponized.

120
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,980
Lesson two.

121
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,880
It's not just the facts that
matter, but our feelings as well.

122
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,160
I don't think that he's good for you.

123
00:07:50,265 --> 00:07:51,960
How do you know what's good for me?

124
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,680
That's my opinion.

125
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,420
Meet Tamara, judge of Real
Housewives of Orange County.

126
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,140
Dramatic yes, but also deeply human.

127
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,520
This wasn't a petty argument over
shoes or missing party invitation.

128
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:08,755
She was sharing her real feelings
and opinions about the man her friend

129
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,975
Vicki was dating who'd embroiled Vicki.

130
00:08:11,095 --> 00:08:15,535
Among other things, a very long con
fabricating a cancer diagnosis just

131
00:08:15,535 --> 00:08:17,575
as emotions run high at reunions.

132
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:19,945
They also shape our incident coordination.

133
00:08:19,945 --> 00:08:24,710
I. Response and reflection feelings
during an incident can span a wide

134
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:30,500
spectrum from despair to vigilance to
shock at discovering that deprecated

135
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,720
API isn't actually deprecated to pride.

136
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,829
Watching your team confidently dive
in, investigate, and collaborate.

137
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:41,600
And when reflecting on incidents,
we often focus on the negative, the

138
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,839
stress, fear, anxiety, and exhaustion.

139
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:50,800
This negativity bias causes our brains to
hold tighter onto those bad experiences

140
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,260
more strongly than the positive ones.

141
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:57,310
And while we shouldn't invalidate
these challenging emotions, postmortem

142
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,810
reports, in my opinion and experience
typically overemphasize them.

143
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,580
Three ways that you can counter
this negativity bias is asking what

144
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,650
prevented this situation from worsening?

145
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,770
What aspects of our response
are you most proud of?

146
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,780
And where did we get lucky?

147
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:18,865
These questions reveal strengths that
we can deliberately amplify, not just

148
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:22,045
highlight weaknesses and deficiencies
that need to be addressed through

149
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:24,594
a laundry list of action items.

150
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:27,714
Lesson three, facilitation is a skill.

151
00:09:28,165 --> 00:09:29,005
Let's roll the tape.

152
00:09:29,155 --> 00:09:32,635
During your fight with Carol, you
got in a jab saying, at least I'm not

153
00:09:32,635 --> 00:09:35,604
50 years old, but you stopped there.

154
00:09:35,604 --> 00:09:38,635
What was the rest of your insult
before you cut yourself off?

155
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:42,954
That's Andy Cohen, host and executive
producer of The Real Housewives.

156
00:09:43,435 --> 00:09:46,104
What you just witnessed
isn't facilitation.

157
00:09:46,314 --> 00:09:50,665
It's provocation designed to generate
viral moments at the expense of

158
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:53,035
participants comfort and dignity.

159
00:09:53,214 --> 00:09:56,994
This approach creates the exact
opposite of psychological safety.

160
00:09:56,994 --> 00:10:00,250
I. It's an environment where
vulnerability is weaponized.

161
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,270
Mistakes are spotlighted for
entertainment, and participants arrive

162
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,540
on the defense and armored for attack.

163
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,230
In our world, this is a bit of an
anti-lesson because for technical

164
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:15,220
postmortems, psychological safety
is the foundation of upon which

165
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,930
all of our learning is built.

166
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,350
It does mean that we need to create
conditions where people can speak.

167
00:10:20,805 --> 00:10:24,135
Honestly about what they saw,
what they did, and what they

168
00:10:24,135 --> 00:10:28,035
thought during an incident without
fear of career consequences,

169
00:10:28,605 --> 00:10:30,915
punishment, or public humiliation.

170
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:35,655
When this type of psychological safety
exists, people shift from defending

171
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:41,085
their actions to examining them
objectively, alongside others, and

172
00:10:41,085 --> 00:10:43,155
this transformation isn't just nice.

173
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:47,925
It's necessary for meaningful learning
to occur, and you can cultivate this.

174
00:10:48,324 --> 00:10:52,104
By modeling curiosity rather than
judgment when asking questions

175
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:57,805
explicitly stating that the goal is to
learn not to blame, and acknowledging

176
00:10:57,805 --> 00:11:00,084
your own mistakes and limitations.

177
00:11:00,145 --> 00:11:03,775
Balancing airtime is another
crucial aspect of facilitation.

178
00:11:04,584 --> 00:11:08,005
This chart comes from an account
called the Bravo Analyst that

179
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:10,974
tracks the screen time each cast
member gets throughout the season.

180
00:11:11,425 --> 00:11:15,834
What makes this data so fascinating to
me is that all of the women are filming

181
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:20,604
roughly the same amount of time and
hours, but as we can see, some dominate

182
00:11:20,604 --> 00:11:22,854
the final edit and others barely appear.

183
00:11:23,605 --> 00:11:28,314
This reveals the invisible hand of
production, the deliberate choices made

184
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:32,995
behind the scenes about whose stories
get amplified, whose conflicts drive

185
00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:36,385
the narrative, and whose perspectives
are going to shape the viewer's

186
00:11:36,415 --> 00:11:40,975
ultimate understanding of events in
our postmortem, the facilitator plays

187
00:11:40,975 --> 00:11:45,895
this producer role and without careful
attention to balancing airtime, the

188
00:11:45,895 --> 00:11:50,965
loudest voices, often the ones with the
most seniority or sway can dominate.

189
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:54,595
This means different perspectives
get filtered out, not because

190
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:58,165
they lack value, but because they
don't have space to be expressed.

191
00:11:58,675 --> 00:12:02,545
Notice how Andy's question, what
was the rest of your insult?

192
00:12:02,695 --> 00:12:05,395
Immediately would put
anybody on the defensive.

193
00:12:05,665 --> 00:12:09,175
It frames the housewife as the
aggressor and invites judgment

194
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:10,615
rather than understanding.

195
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:13,520
In contrast, effective
postmortem questions focus on

196
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,325
the how rather than the why.

197
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:19,705
Why questions often come across as
accusatory and trigger defensiveness.

198
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,850
Why didn't you check the logs?

199
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,130
Implies a failure or deficiency?

200
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,150
How?

201
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,420
Questions, however, invite,
description and exploration.

202
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,180
How did you approach
troubleshooting at that point?

203
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,980
Which open space for the responder to
share their context and thought process?

204
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:41,260
And I'll just add, facilitation is
absolutely a skill that can be learned

205
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,450
and honed through practice in feedback.

206
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,200
If you're looking to develop this
skill in yourself, I highly recommend

207
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:52,540
the debriefing facilitation guide from
Etsy circa 2016, but totally evergreen.

208
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,640
And lastly, as a facilitator.

209
00:12:54,854 --> 00:12:59,385
Your mindset and energy sets the
tone for the entire meeting and the

210
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:03,915
vibe of the room, and it doesn't
have to be stuffy or sterile.

211
00:13:04,035 --> 00:13:09,045
At SR Econ Katie Wilde from sny shared
that she begins every incident review by

212
00:13:09,045 --> 00:13:13,814
playing a specially selected song that
she thinks relates or ties to the outage.

213
00:13:13,905 --> 00:13:18,015
This change transformed
postmortems into anticipated

214
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:19,694
meetings, creating a buzz around.

215
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:22,275
What song was Katie gonna pick and play?

216
00:13:22,425 --> 00:13:28,365
I think this is a fabulous way of
getting people primed, open, feeling

217
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:30,194
creative, and ready to share.

218
00:13:30,285 --> 00:13:34,064
If you need musical inspiration from
the Housewives universe, an incident

219
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,944
relating to a cloud spend surprise, try.

220
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:39,255
It's expensive to be me by Erica Jane.

221
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:44,145
If you've got a security breach, insecure
by Candace, we'll have your back.

222
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,050
And delayed logs causing a log jam.

223
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:52,239
Don't be tardy for the party by Kim
Z. This brings us to lesson four,

224
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,680
the meeting before the meeting.

225
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,229
Part of SRE involves influencing
without authority, and I've interpreted

226
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:03,699
this mostly as strategic networking
because while formal postmortem

227
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:06,339
reports and meetings are essential.

228
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:10,104
Significant value can emerge
from conversations outside

229
00:14:10,104 --> 00:14:11,545
those official channels.

230
00:14:11,545 --> 00:14:13,015
I haven't heard from her
in a couple of months.

231
00:14:13,015 --> 00:14:17,094
She sends me a text yesterday
basically trying to silence me.

232
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:18,444
It was so manipulative.

233
00:14:18,805 --> 00:14:21,354
It was so calculated here.

234
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:25,285
Kyle was attempting to control the
narrative through backroom deals and

235
00:14:25,285 --> 00:14:30,594
secret packs, which fans refer to as
self-producing or in the corporate world.

236
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:32,545
We might call the meeting
before the meeting.

237
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:38,470
The other thing I noticed in that
is Dorit splashy dramatic reveal was

238
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:43,630
likely egged on by her own producer who
was incentivized to get high ratings.

239
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:47,110
And producers again remain
largely invisible despite.

240
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,915
Wielding enormous influence.

241
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:53,035
They're the ones asking leaning
questions and confessionals.

242
00:14:53,305 --> 00:14:58,375
They create situations designed to
trigger conflict and ultimately are

243
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:02,395
the ones who decide what narrative
threads to develop in air and what

244
00:15:02,395 --> 00:15:04,285
gets left on the cutting room floor.

245
00:15:04,495 --> 00:15:09,535
But an SREI do think we could put on
that producer hat and wield narrative

246
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:11,965
shaping power for positive outcomes.

247
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:12,895
Amy.

248
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:17,605
Toby introduced me to the concept of
one-on-one debriefs in her brilliant

249
00:15:17,605 --> 00:15:20,335
talk at SR Econ, one-on-one SRE.

250
00:15:20,995 --> 00:15:25,915
Unlike Kyle's manipulative texting
these one-on-one debriefs strengthen

251
00:15:25,915 --> 00:15:29,935
working relationships and deepen
collective understanding where Kyle

252
00:15:29,935 --> 00:15:31,795
sought two silence perspectives.

253
00:15:31,855 --> 00:15:35,125
These one-on-ones deliberately
create space for voices that

254
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,345
might otherwise remain unheard.

255
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:40,465
Amy's approach includes some
powerful questions like.

256
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,870
What surprised you most
about this incident?

257
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,070
Were you able to access the support
you needed during the response?

258
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,490
Did our tools and documentation
serve you effectively?

259
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,990
And my favorite?

260
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,590
Did you practice self-care
before and during the incident?

261
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,150
This question rarely appears in
standard postmortem templates, which

262
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:06,010
is wild because Responder Wellbeing
fundamentally affects everything from

263
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:10,450
incident duration to the quality of
the long-term solutions proposed.

264
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:14,530
This is just a handful of the
recommended questions from Amy, the

265
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,970
ones that resonated most with me.

266
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:20,800
I really encourage you to watch the
full talk or leaf through her slides.

267
00:16:20,944 --> 00:16:22,775
For the full list.

268
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:24,935
I tried this one-on-one debrief approach.

269
00:16:24,935 --> 00:16:30,574
After an incident we affectionately called
Kaf Apocalypse, which was major multi-hour

270
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:32,854
incident resulting in data loss.

271
00:16:33,094 --> 00:16:38,435
By consciously producing these pre-meeting
conversations and weaving together

272
00:16:38,435 --> 00:16:43,444
the resulting insights resulted in
uncovering layers of understanding

273
00:16:43,444 --> 00:16:47,314
that just wouldn't have surfaced
from our typical group setting.

274
00:16:47,535 --> 00:16:49,665
Single hour postmortem meeting.

275
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:53,175
What was most important to me was
that the developers who experienced

276
00:16:53,205 --> 00:16:57,854
acute stress felt heard, and that
their experience was meaningfully

277
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:00,915
acknowledged and received by the org.

278
00:17:00,975 --> 00:17:04,244
This brings us to lesson
three, let the Mouse Go.

279
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:08,844
Which became a memorable legendary
housewife's moment from Sutton.

280
00:17:08,935 --> 00:17:11,485
Streck said it five
years ago when I met her.

281
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,405
Let the mouse go.

282
00:17:13,675 --> 00:17:14,485
Let the mouse go.

283
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:15,765
Seriously.

284
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:21,255
The backstory is that another castmate had
invited everyone to a party and said there

285
00:17:21,255 --> 00:17:23,475
would be a special guest in attendance.

286
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:23,985
Somebody.

287
00:17:23,985 --> 00:17:26,055
They all knew Sutton.

288
00:17:26,565 --> 00:17:30,285
Anxiety spiraling had somehow
convinced herself this special guest

289
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:34,845
was somebody she actively was having
a business conflict and beef with.

290
00:17:35,415 --> 00:17:39,555
It wasn't, and the whole thing could
have been forgotten except Dorit

291
00:17:39,555 --> 00:17:43,995
kept bringing it up, exaggerating
Sutton's reactions and remarks at

292
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:49,185
every opportunity culminating in this
explosive blowup at an all cast dinner.

293
00:17:49,455 --> 00:17:51,945
The takeaway here is don't be the dori.

294
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:54,315
Know when to let the mouse go.

295
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:55,485
What do I mean by that?

296
00:17:55,584 --> 00:18:00,114
We all have our reliability soap
boxes or longstanding systemic issued.

297
00:18:00,114 --> 00:18:03,954
We'd like to see addressed and
have been bemoaning for years.

298
00:18:04,314 --> 00:18:07,884
And if this is you, it is really tempting.

299
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:08,814
I will admit.

300
00:18:08,814 --> 00:18:13,644
It is so tempting to use these
incidents and impacts as validation

301
00:18:13,824 --> 00:18:15,234
that you are right all along.

302
00:18:15,234 --> 00:18:17,814
And dear God, could somebody
just listen to you, give you

303
00:18:17,814 --> 00:18:19,794
a roadmap and fund a team?

304
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:20,664
Let's be real.

305
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:26,139
Unlike the infamous psychic Allison Deis
from the dinner party from hell, you

306
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:30,850
aren't clairvoyant and no, you couldn't
predict exactly when and how an incident

307
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,610
could unfold or what the impact would be.

308
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,330
If you could, you would be
called AIOps and at least triple

309
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,590
your current take home pay.

310
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:43,479
So remember that these I told
you so moments actively undermine

311
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:45,370
our collective learning goals.

312
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,849
And they shift the focus from
understanding what happened

313
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:51,039
to assigning credit and blame.

314
00:18:51,219 --> 00:18:54,639
I'll note this isn't about
suppressing legitimate concerns.

315
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:59,199
It's about strategic focus and supporting
the goals of the postmortem at hand.

316
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:01,359
Lesson six time box, it.

317
00:19:01,884 --> 00:19:06,144
If you've ever suffered through a three
Part Real Housewives reunion filled

318
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:10,554
with endless flashbacks and circular
arguments, you understand the pain of a

319
00:19:10,554 --> 00:19:12,864
meeting that doesn't know when to end.

320
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:18,354
Let's see how co-facilitator Andy handles
the long day shooting at a reunion.

321
00:19:18,474 --> 00:19:20,964
I've had an incredibly
difficult last two years.

322
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:22,604
Don't you dare.

323
00:19:23,054 --> 00:19:24,104
Don't you dare.

324
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:25,079
I'm sorry I didn't.

325
00:19:25,084 --> 00:19:25,784
Don't you dare.

326
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:25,964
Okay.

327
00:19:26,384 --> 00:19:28,724
I like being able to have
that banter with my friends.

328
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:30,120
Am I boring you?

329
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:31,899
I didn't have the desire.

330
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:33,570
Am I boring you?

331
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,080
No, I'm sorry.

332
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,514
I swallowing you.

333
00:19:35,514 --> 00:19:35,715
Are you me?

334
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:35,796
Are you kidding?

335
00:19:35,802 --> 00:19:37,114
I'm sorry again.

336
00:19:37,495 --> 00:19:38,274
I'm really two.

337
00:19:38,405 --> 00:19:38,754
Sorry.

338
00:19:39,175 --> 00:19:40,594
I'm like, sorry.

339
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:42,990
Let me pull it back so I
can not be long winded.

340
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:47,449
Andy says, we're well past the
point of you being long-winded.

341
00:19:47,949 --> 00:19:51,429
Post-mortem meetings like reunions
need clear time boundaries,

342
00:19:51,819 --> 00:19:53,469
and this isn't revolutionary.

343
00:19:53,499 --> 00:19:55,089
It's basic meeting courtesy.

344
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:59,259
Deeper discussions emerge that require
more time than you have allocated.

345
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:03,189
Go ahead and schedule those separately,
but don't let them derail your

346
00:20:03,189 --> 00:20:05,829
primary objectives as a participant.

347
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:09,909
If you know that you tend towards
veracity, gather your thoughts ahead

348
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:14,379
of time, and when you're speaking,
keep an eye on the clock to note how

349
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,449
long you have been chattering away for.

350
00:20:17,004 --> 00:20:19,945
Or perhaps challenge yourself
to listen first and only speak

351
00:20:19,945 --> 00:20:21,685
after multiple people have shared.

352
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,835
On the flip side, if you're the
facilitator, you should probably

353
00:20:24,835 --> 00:20:28,855
have a sense of who might send things
off track and prepare strategies

354
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:30,534
to reroute the conversation.

355
00:20:30,655 --> 00:20:34,915
Respect everyone's time by staying focused
on your learning goals and on time.

356
00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:38,095
No mega multi-hour
marathon meetings, please.

357
00:20:38,095 --> 00:20:40,225
We do not need a three part postmortem.

358
00:20:40,284 --> 00:20:42,175
Finally, lesson seven.

359
00:20:42,264 --> 00:20:43,375
Most important of all.

360
00:20:44,214 --> 00:20:45,654
Avoiding the blame game.

361
00:20:45,714 --> 00:20:49,824
The way we talk about blame, at least
within tech and reliability, has evolved

362
00:20:49,824 --> 00:20:54,985
across my career span from blame as the
default, which unfortunately is where

363
00:20:54,985 --> 00:21:00,324
many organizations are stuck today
to blamelessness, which I think also

364
00:21:00,324 --> 00:21:04,605
somehow lost its way after becoming
buzz worded, leading us to today's

365
00:21:04,665 --> 00:21:07,875
measured blame aware approach, at least.

366
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,570
That's what we're using the last time
I checked the blogs and I'm happy

367
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,070
to give you an apology, Meredith.

368
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,129
Here's a few things that
I'd like an apology for.

369
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,040
Number one,

370
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,740
gotta love SLC.

371
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,340
In that clip, Angie wasn't willing
to hold herself accountable until

372
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:29,800
Meredith apologized for the very long
list of grievances on that prop scroll.

373
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:34,330
Angie clearly wasn't seeking
understanding or forward movement.

374
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,570
She was casting blame and
withholding accountability.

375
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,669
Blame seeks to find the person
or people or team responsible

376
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:44,350
for causing the incident.

377
00:21:44,739 --> 00:21:49,540
It creates a retributive culture
focused on punishment, which erodes

378
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:54,370
trust, harms relationship, and
importantly prevents learning.

379
00:21:55,075 --> 00:21:57,145
It also increases risk.

380
00:21:57,145 --> 00:21:57,925
Secrecy.

381
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:03,065
A new word to me which I've read,
is the tendency to hide mistakes

382
00:22:03,065 --> 00:22:06,785
or information that might get
those fingers pointed at you.

383
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:11,105
The alternative is a restorative
culture founded on trust,

384
00:22:11,435 --> 00:22:13,235
learning, and accountability.

385
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:18,750
It seeks to understand what not,
who was responsible for an incident.

386
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:20,450
Here's the truth.

387
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,990
People don't come to work
intending to cause incidents.

388
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:28,100
Developers don't wake up and say, what
level of sev should I cause today?

389
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:33,290
And similarly in the housewives world,
castmates don't join franchises planning

390
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,750
to betray decades long friendships.

391
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,500
People make decisions that make
sense given their understanding,

392
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,260
available information and
pressures that they're under.

393
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:47,615
Recognition of this shared humanity is
where our valuable learning can begin.

394
00:22:47,765 --> 00:22:50,375
Here's a particular passage
from Sydney Decker's.

395
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:54,335
Stop blaming a passage that I
clearly vibed with on my first read.

396
00:22:54,425 --> 00:22:56,345
People didn't make bad choices.

397
00:22:56,525 --> 00:23:02,015
They probably had bad choices, and your
org has a gigantic role in having handed

398
00:23:02,015 --> 00:23:05,010
them out based on my emphatic highlights.

399
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:09,149
I wonder if you can guess which type of
culture I was working in at the time.

400
00:23:09,735 --> 00:23:14,115
This book, stop Blaming outlines
how Blameful cultures harm us, and

401
00:23:14,115 --> 00:23:17,865
importantly provides a roadmap for
building a restorative culture.

402
00:23:18,165 --> 00:23:23,205
I highly recommend you check it out, spin
up a book club at your company, and invite

403
00:23:23,205 --> 00:23:25,245
the executives to read this one with you.

404
00:23:25,365 --> 00:23:28,274
Now, these seven lessons from
the Fabulous Ladies of the Real

405
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:32,685
Housewives can transform how
we in SRE approach postmortems.

406
00:23:33,435 --> 00:23:37,574
Both of our worlds involve humans trying
to construct meaning from complex,

407
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:42,524
evolving, and emotionally charged
situations with limited information.

408
00:23:42,615 --> 00:23:46,965
And I'd be remiss not to mention that our
worlds do differ in a couple key ways.

409
00:23:47,415 --> 00:23:51,284
First, Housewives are incentivized
for drama and viral moments.

410
00:23:51,345 --> 00:23:53,294
Their paychecks literally depend on it.

411
00:23:53,355 --> 00:23:58,185
We, thankfully, are not rewarded for table
flips or throwing drinks, but instead,

412
00:23:58,245 --> 00:24:00,735
success metrics around system stability.

413
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,530
Learning and continuous improvement.

414
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,800
And the second difference
is obviously the fashion.

415
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:09,530
Now, I'm not gonna co-sign
all of these outfits, but you

416
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,840
cannot deny they've got style.

417
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,830
I have yet to walk into an incident
postmortem where folks showed up

418
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,699
in color coordinating floor length
gowns or sky high Louboutins.

419
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,120
I'm not opposed to it.

420
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,979
Maybe this is another lesson we could
take from the ladies, but beneath these

421
00:24:25,979 --> 00:24:28,259
surface differences lies a profound truth.

422
00:24:28,854 --> 00:24:32,965
In both reality TV and technical
incidents, there is not a

423
00:24:32,965 --> 00:24:34,644
single objective reality.

424
00:24:35,034 --> 00:24:40,254
There are only perspectives in
complete, biased and uniquely valuable.

425
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:44,904
The most powerful insights and learnings
emerge when we listen deeply to each

426
00:24:44,904 --> 00:24:50,215
other's experiences, and when we approach
complexity with humility and curiosity.

427
00:24:50,304 --> 00:24:53,874
Next time you're in a postmortem,
remember to bring the receipts, honor

428
00:24:53,874 --> 00:24:56,514
those emotions, facilitate with care.

429
00:24:57,024 --> 00:24:59,634
Try out those incident
one-on-one debriefs.

430
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,614
Know when to let the mouse go.

431
00:25:01,854 --> 00:25:05,394
Respect time boundaries,
and resist the blame game.

432
00:25:05,544 --> 00:25:09,475
If this type of practical and tactical
information on making operations

433
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:14,245
on call and incident response more
effective and sustainable for us humans.
