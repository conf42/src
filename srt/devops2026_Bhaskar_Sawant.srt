00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,019
Speaker 6: Hello everyone, and
thank you for joining me today.

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,760
My name is Baska.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,219
I'm a senior developer and team lead.

4
00:00:07,609 --> 00:00:11,390
I am also an I Triple E Senior member
with the Southeastern Michigan section.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,160
Over the past 15 years, I have
been working on CI ICD pipeline,

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,940
develop automation and enterprise
scale software delivery systems.

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,930
Today I want to talk about, shift
that is quietly, but fundamentally

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,860
changing our industry, how the
software is written, how it's

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,619
delivered, and how it must be secured.

10
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,690
The title of this session is
Shift Left shield A Ecop Playbook

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,090
for AI Era, CICD Pipeline.

12
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,800
This is a practical blueprint
for securing the modern pipelines

13
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,095
without compromising the speed.

14
00:00:44,595 --> 00:00:50,395
In the last few years, tools like
GitHub copilot or and Chan GTP, have

15
00:00:50,395 --> 00:00:54,685
moved from being experimental helpers
to everyday development companions.

16
00:00:55,435 --> 00:00:59,275
They write code, generate, test,
create scripts, and E one suggests

17
00:00:59,275 --> 00:01:00,925
the infrastructure configurations.

18
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:05,905
That acceleration is exciting, but
it also introduce a new reality.

19
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:11,780
Our pipeline are now trusting the
code that no signal single human,

20
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,820
fully wrote or reviewed end-to-end.

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,160
So the question I would like to
us to explore today is simple.

22
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,900
How do we secure the software
when the software is increasingly

23
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,190
written by the machines?

24
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,090
For decades, software
security was built on.

25
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,170
A basic assumption.

26
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,330
Code is written by the humans.

27
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:36,020
We hired the developers, train
them, receive their codes,

28
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,490
and held them accountable.

29
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,680
Today that assumption has changed.

30
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,570
AI assisted coding and automated
code generation have fundamentally

31
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,000
transformed the software development
tools like GitHub, copilot and chat GTP.

32
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,940
Now write the significant
portion of the production code.

33
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,940
This dramatically accelerate the delivery,
but it also introduced the security

34
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:02,020
challenges that traditional DevSecOps
practices were never designed to handle.

35
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:08,209
The attack surface has exposed
expanded beyond the human return code.

36
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,009
AI generator snippets.

37
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,450
Automated dependency updates and
machine learn configuration now

38
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,050
flow through the pipelines often
without the scrutiny they deserve.

39
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:23,255
Understanding these new threats
vectors is first step towards building

40
00:02:23,255 --> 00:02:27,740
the resilience resilient, and the
secure CICD system in the AI era.

41
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,740
This slide highlights the new risk that
comes with the AI assisted development.

42
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,260
First prompt injection attacks.

43
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:40,490
Malicious actors can manipulate the AI
coding assistant through the carefully

44
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,930
crafted comments and documentation,
causing them to generate the vulnerable

45
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,030
code or expose the sensitive data.

46
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,520
Second, training data poisoning.

47
00:02:50,075 --> 00:02:55,415
AI models trained on a public repositories
may learn and reproduce this insecure

48
00:02:55,415 --> 00:03:00,755
patterns, duplicated libraries, or
even the hardcoded credentials that

49
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:02,255
slipped into the training data.

50
00:03:02,915 --> 00:03:05,555
Third, automated dependency confusion.

51
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:11,225
When AI suggests package names,
attackers can exploit the typo, sweating

52
00:03:11,435 --> 00:03:15,065
to insert the malicious libraries
directly into the build pipeline.

53
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:18,305
And finally, osculated malicious code.

54
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:24,214
AI generated code reviews may miss
the sophisticated obs techniques

55
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:28,144
that experience the human
reviewers would normally flag.

56
00:03:28,864 --> 00:03:30,635
These risks are not hypothetical.

57
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:34,834
They are already appearing in a modern
supply software supply chain attacks.

58
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:35,390
The

59
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,950
impact of the previous slide
mentioned risk is already visible.

60
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:45,219
The recent industry research shows
that 78% organizations have experienced

61
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:49,599
at least one software supply chain
SEC security incident in past years.

62
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:56,819
At the same time, AI tools now generate
an estimated 40% of a new enterprise code.

63
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,289
That means potential blast
radius of compromised AI assisted

64
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,390
workflow has never been hired.

65
00:04:04,185 --> 00:04:08,834
Traditionally, security gates catch known
vulnerabilities, but they are blind to the

66
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:11,714
subtle risk embedded in AI generated code.

67
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:17,234
The real challenge today is not
just preventing that bad code, it is

68
00:04:17,234 --> 00:04:20,984
ensuring that traceability, maintaining
the provenance, and building the

69
00:04:20,984 --> 00:04:26,234
confidence in a, in and increasingly
automated development workflow.

70
00:04:26,775 --> 00:04:32,294
In simple terms, we must prove what we
deploy is what we intended to build.

71
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:37,894
Please bring us to the foundation
Shift left Security shift left means

72
00:04:37,894 --> 00:04:42,274
embedded security directly into
the development workflow instead of

73
00:04:42,274 --> 00:04:44,074
adding it at the end of the pipeline.

74
00:04:44,734 --> 00:04:49,624
This slide highlights the three key
principles, secure by design, embedding

75
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:52,924
the security directly into the
development workflows, early detection.

76
00:04:53,869 --> 00:04:57,919
Identifying and remaining the
vulnerability as early as possible.

77
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,929
Automated enforcement, automating
the security policy enforcement.

78
00:05:03,619 --> 00:05:09,069
Shifting left means production protection
is built into every development phase.

79
00:05:09,429 --> 00:05:13,449
From realtime code scanning to
dependency, validation, making

80
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:17,414
security strong, yet seamless for
the developers, the goal is simple.

81
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:21,339
Security should feel natural
to the developers, not like

82
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:22,419
an external checkpoint.

83
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:27,249
When done correctly, developers
move fast, and security keeps

84
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:28,959
space silently in the background.

85
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:33,329
To test the software, we must know
exactly what goes into the every

86
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:34,919
build and where it came from.

87
00:05:35,429 --> 00:05:38,009
This slide combined two critical ideas.

88
00:05:38,369 --> 00:05:42,329
Software build of materials
means SBOs and build provenance.

89
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:43,139
First.

90
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:48,509
SBO generates the comprehensive machine
readable list of every dependency

91
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,184
and build time to use to build it.

92
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:56,034
When responses are generated automatically
and integrated with the vulnerability

93
00:05:56,034 --> 00:05:59,934
databases, we gain the immediate
visibility into the supply chain.

94
00:05:59,934 --> 00:06:06,114
Risk policies can then enforce which
components are allowed into our pipeline.

95
00:06:06,614 --> 00:06:11,804
Second Bill Provenance uses the SLSA
frameworks to create the verifiable

96
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:19,304
records of who built an artifact when it
was built and under what condition signed.

97
00:06:19,304 --> 00:06:21,434
Bill Attestations are immutable.

98
00:06:21,934 --> 00:06:26,404
Go along ensures the artifact reaching
the production is exactly what was

99
00:06:26,404 --> 00:06:28,744
built with no tampering in between.

100
00:06:29,284 --> 00:06:33,664
In simple, Toms SBOs tells
us what is inside provenance

101
00:06:33,664 --> 00:06:35,134
tells us where it came from.

102
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:38,944
Together they establish the
trust in a software delivery.

103
00:06:39,444 --> 00:06:42,174
Once we have the visibility
and the provenance, we need

104
00:06:42,174 --> 00:06:43,314
a consistent enforcement.

105
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:48,039
Policy as a code frameworks
defines the security requirement

106
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:49,989
as version and testable code.

107
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:52,059
We define the policy in a code.

108
00:06:52,299 --> 00:06:54,369
We test the policy logic in A-C-I-C-D.

109
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:59,379
We enforce the policy at commit,
build, deploy, and run time, and

110
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:01,719
we audit and refine them over time.

111
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:07,359
This ensures the security enforcement is
consistent, repeatable, and automated.

112
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:11,019
Without slowing down the
developers, security becomes

113
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:12,399
engineering, not the paperwork.

114
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,639
System are high value targets.

115
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:19,979
If attackers com compromise a built
environment, they gain the perfect

116
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:23,549
position to inject the malicious
score into every artifact we ship.

117
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:26,639
Hardening requires the
multiple layers of defense.

118
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:32,639
Container isolation ensures each
build runs in a clean, imperial

119
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,949
environment with the minimal privileges.

120
00:07:35,549 --> 00:07:40,289
Infrastructure as a code makes the build
configuration auditable and reproducible.

121
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:45,089
Artifact signing creates the
cryptographic proof that the artifact

122
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:48,109
have artifacts hasn't been tampered with.

123
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:53,000
After the build together, these
controls the significant, significantly

124
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,500
reduce the build system risk.

125
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,930
This slide shows how infrastructure
as a code strengthens the security

126
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,070
build environment should be
destroyed and recreate for every job.

127
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,930
Preventing the persistent compromises
build processes must follow

128
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:12,175
least privileged access using the
scope credentials and realtime.

129
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:18,740
A time limited tokens network should be
segmented, isolating the build system

130
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:24,020
from production and limiting the external
connectivity to the approved sources.

131
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,190
These control prevent the persistent
attack and limit the lateral

132
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,049
movement inside the infrastructure.

133
00:08:30,549 --> 00:08:33,249
Modern CICD platforms runs.

134
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,854
Run build is disposable
container environment.

135
00:08:37,304 --> 00:08:40,664
This prevents the attacker
persistence and limit the blast

136
00:08:40,664 --> 00:08:42,434
areas if the build is compromised.

137
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:47,165
Complementing the isolation artifact
signing, using loop tools like

138
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:51,214
co-sign or sign store established
the cryptographic proof that

139
00:08:51,214 --> 00:08:53,285
artifacts hasn't been tempered with.

140
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:59,045
After the bill only verified and
authorized artifact or artifacts proceeds

141
00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:00,694
through the pipeline into the production.

142
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:03,545
Key insight, isolation limits.

143
00:09:03,545 --> 00:09:07,595
The blast radius signing provides
the very favorable providence.

144
00:09:07,985 --> 00:09:11,075
Together they provide the
defense in depth for software.

145
00:09:11,075 --> 00:09:11,585
Supply chain

146
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:16,375
security is only about, is not
only about the prevention, it

147
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,845
is also about the detection.

148
00:09:18,505 --> 00:09:20,965
This slide shows the
monitoring across the pipeline.

149
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:25,015
The code commit, scan code
and validate the signature.

150
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:28,074
Add the dependency
resolution, purify the checks.

151
00:09:28,074 --> 00:09:29,515
Sum and detect the typo.

152
00:09:30,015 --> 00:09:31,245
Add build execution.

153
00:09:31,574 --> 00:09:36,954
Monitor for anomalies and ex
exploitation and artifact publishing.

154
00:09:37,454 --> 00:09:40,364
Validating the his poem and
provenance add deployment.

155
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:43,064
Enforce the signature and policy checks.

156
00:09:43,664 --> 00:09:47,864
This creates the continuous visibility
across the entire software lifecycle.

157
00:09:48,364 --> 00:09:53,704
Here we see the real world indicators
of supply chain manipulation, behavioral

158
00:09:53,704 --> 00:09:58,724
anomalies, such as unusual bill
duration, unexpected network traffic

159
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:03,944
or unauthorized changes to build the
scripts Technical indicators such as

160
00:10:04,005 --> 00:10:09,525
unsigned commits, mismatched package
checksums, missing SBOs data or

161
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,745
artifacts without valid provenance.

162
00:10:12,255 --> 00:10:13,489
These patterns allows.

163
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,879
Teams to detect manipulation teams
before they reach the production

164
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:23,479
For Dave SecOps to be sustainable
security must be fast automated

165
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:24,979
and seamlessly integrated.

166
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,290
We shift security into the IDE, so
issues are caught before the commit.

167
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,839
We parallelized security scans
with the functional test.

168
00:10:36,395 --> 00:10:40,295
We provide the actionable feedback
so developers know exactly

169
00:10:40,444 --> 00:10:42,994
how to mitigate the problems.

170
00:10:43,494 --> 00:10:47,334
This ensures a strong protection without
blocking the developer's productivity.

171
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:50,024
A strong security program is measurable.

172
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:54,514
We aim to detect the issues in
under two minutes, limited the

173
00:10:54,514 --> 00:10:56,059
vulnerabilities in under 10 minutes.

174
00:10:56,764 --> 00:11:01,954
Maintain nearly hundred percent artifact
signature coverage and achieve zero supply

175
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:03,914
chain Indic incidents in production.

176
00:11:04,574 --> 00:11:09,734
These metrics demonstrate how security
enhances delivery velocity through

177
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:11,594
the automation and fast feedback.

178
00:11:12,094 --> 00:11:14,134
These slides summarize
the practical approach.

179
00:11:14,404 --> 00:11:16,234
Start with SBOs and provenance.

180
00:11:16,684 --> 00:11:20,404
Implement the policy as a
code hard build systems.

181
00:11:20,794 --> 00:11:24,484
Monitor for anomalies
and major and iterate.

182
00:11:25,294 --> 00:11:29,914
Security posture must evolve to
match the AI assisted automated

183
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:32,104
and faster software sub delivery.

184
00:11:32,604 --> 00:11:34,045
AI assisted development.

185
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:37,359
Is here to, automation will only grow.

186
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:40,989
That means our security
practices must evolve with it.

187
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:45,339
When we shift left, we build the
security into the development.

188
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,869
When we shift right, we protect the
production with the variable trust.

189
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:54,810
This is how we move fast without losing
the confidence, integrity, or trust.

190
00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:56,699
Thank you so much for your time.

191
