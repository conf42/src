1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,210
Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,570
I'm truly honored to be here at
Conference for Thank you for giving me

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,130
this platform to discuss a topic that is
shaping not just our industries, but our

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,260
societies, and ultimately our futures.

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,700
My name is Vanil mpa, and I specialize in
cloud technologies and ethical AI design.

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,470
Today I invite you onto a journey where
the story of cloud AI is not just about

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,130
efficiency, gains and profitability,
but with a lot of responsibility,

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,730
ethics, and trust, because technology
at it best serves the humanity.

9
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:33,614
And it, at worst, it can
divide, oppress, and even harm.

10
00:00:34,245 --> 00:00:37,004
Let's explore how we can ensure
it, it all services better.

11
00:00:38,565 --> 00:00:42,165
The cloud AI revolution we are living
through a once in a generation.

12
00:00:42,165 --> 00:00:46,635
Transformation organizations are
embracing up to a 40% operational

13
00:00:46,635 --> 00:00:50,135
gains with with enhancing in the ai.

14
00:00:50,405 --> 00:00:54,845
Even a lightweight integrations create at
least 25% of baseline efficiency, which is

15
00:00:54,845 --> 00:00:56,185
see which we're seeing as an improvement.

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,320
And the cost structures
have changed forever.

17
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,800
Millions are saved through
predictive analytics, optimization,

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,880
and intelligent automation.

19
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,280
Let's talk about some real-time examples.

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,970
UPS saved 10 million gallons of
fuel annually through through ai.

21
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:15,860
Routing healthcare systems are
cutting ICU vision times by 30% with

22
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,900
using predictive staffing models.

23
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:22,940
Amazon, which we use every day, generates
about 35% of its revenue straight

24
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,679
through AI driven recommendation engine.

25
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:26,495
AI cloud is.

26
00:01:26,495 --> 00:01:28,175
Cloud AI is no longer optional.

27
00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:33,125
It's a foundation of modern and com
to advantage, but with the speed

28
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,865
of the innovation is breathtaking.

29
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:38,015
The speed of ethical
replication also lags behind.

30
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,185
So what's the real time
intelligence benefits?

31
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:44,395
Three primary superpowers are
unlocked through cloud ai, which

32
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,715
is preventing the failures.

33
00:01:45,895 --> 00:01:49,685
Predictive AI detects vulnerabilities
before cast failures occur.

34
00:01:50,465 --> 00:01:54,425
Example IBM Watson, which we heard
recently, it's detecting the factory

35
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:59,195
machines, breakdowns weeks in advance,
accelerating the ratios, real time data

36
00:01:59,195 --> 00:02:03,605
empowers leaders to act immediately
shifting the strategies with the agility

37
00:02:03,785 --> 00:02:05,835
that today's fast moving world demands.

38
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:10,095
Example, American Airlines adjust
its flight flight routes dynamically

39
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:11,955
to avoid weather interactions.

40
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:16,395
And we are talking about next personalized
experiences from Spotify suggesting

41
00:02:16,665 --> 00:02:18,495
what would the next perfect song.

42
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:22,455
And also and the hospitals tailoring
the treatments to genetic profiles.

43
00:02:22,635 --> 00:02:24,945
Personal personalization is
just about the convenience.

44
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:27,495
It's about loyalty, outcome, and lives.

45
00:02:27,855 --> 00:02:31,365
But these benefits must deeper
emerging risk if unchecked.

46
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:36,915
So the ethical challenges which,
which are emerging right now.

47
00:02:37,185 --> 00:02:42,135
Ethical concerns in AI have existed
since its very beginning, dating back

48
00:02:42,165 --> 00:02:47,055
to early debates of over automated
editions which happened in 1960s.

49
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:51,105
Today, three themes dominate the
landscape, which is a privacy.

50
00:02:51,435 --> 00:02:52,995
Everyone is scared of their own privacy.

51
00:02:53,415 --> 00:02:58,155
Data is collected and at unprecedented
scale, yet transparency content

52
00:02:58,235 --> 00:03:00,065
consent mechanism often lagged behind.

53
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:04,565
So algorithm bias, AI learns from
historical data and the historical

54
00:03:04,565 --> 00:03:09,725
data is real with sorele biases, real
time examples, the compass system.

55
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:14,145
Used by us criminal screening
systematically gave black defendants

56
00:03:14,145 --> 00:03:19,130
higher risk of sc of scorings and re
reoffending Amazon internal AI hiring

57
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:24,079
tool performed male candidates, a better
over woman until it's what it was.

58
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:29,060
Disman, the transparency black box
system make decisions that even

59
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:31,135
their creators often cannot explain.

60
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:38,065
Ai at its core, AI ethics is about
protecting dignity, the fairness and

61
00:03:38,065 --> 00:03:44,725
the agency, so the trust, the, there
are a lot of rising concerns here, so

62
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:49,615
trust is the most valuable currency
in the ai if you lose it, and no, no

63
00:03:49,615 --> 00:03:51,610
amount of technical can compensate.

64
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,910
Once the trust loss cannot be
rebuilt, and especially in this

65
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,670
era, what are the different key
trends which we're talking about?

66
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,590
Regulatory pressure is increasing.

67
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,560
Is increasing.

68
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,710
It might be in G-D-P-R-C-C-P-A-E-U-A Act.

69
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:09,780
Canadas EID proposal investors are
prioritizing environmental, social,

70
00:04:09,809 --> 00:04:14,069
and government standards, meaning
ethical AI is just a compliance issue.

71
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:16,110
It's a capital market issue.

72
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,100
Consumers are becoming activism
driven, boycotting companies,

73
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,140
which are seeing analytical proof.

74
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,100
The research shows that companies rank
highly in ethical technology practice

75
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,484
saw that the stocks raised 14% than
their competitors doing the market.

76
00:04:30,484 --> 00:04:35,914
At Tmin Turbulences ethical AI
isn't slowing you down it ins

77
00:04:35,974 --> 00:04:38,164
it's insulating you via loyalty.

78
00:04:39,484 --> 00:04:41,374
Let's talk about few case studies.

79
00:04:41,644 --> 00:04:43,174
Let's start with the financial services.

80
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,659
Cancel the financial sector.

81
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:49,759
The major global bank realized its loan
application AI systematically penalized

82
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,919
applicants from a lower income zip codes.

83
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:53,299
This is ethically wrong.

84
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:57,049
So what's, what are the character
mechanisms they have taken deployed the,

85
00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:01,129
they deployed the advanced bias detection
models, restructuring the data sets

86
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:04,879
to ensure the balance representation,
empowering a cross-functional human panel,

87
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,549
human review panel, the, and the outcomes.

88
00:05:07,609 --> 00:05:08,389
They were amazing.

89
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,719
Approving rates were
harmonized across demographics.

90
00:05:12,064 --> 00:05:16,144
Within a 22% variance and the
customer side and satisfaction

91
00:05:16,474 --> 00:05:18,574
it's sky, it's skyrocketed by 18%.

92
00:05:19,024 --> 00:05:22,864
And regulatory scrutiny, coff
and the brand are so ethical.

93
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,954
Correction just didn't
compromise profitability.

94
00:05:26,044 --> 00:05:27,034
It's enhanced it.

95
00:05:28,174 --> 00:05:30,744
And the next case study, which
we can talk about is healthcare.

96
00:05:31,194 --> 00:05:33,374
Healthcare amplifies the the stakes.

97
00:05:33,644 --> 00:05:36,554
The cloud AI now predicts
the cardiac error, how was in

98
00:05:36,554 --> 00:05:39,704
advance, analyze the cardiac scans
faster than the human radiology.

99
00:05:40,244 --> 00:05:44,449
And Tyler postop treatment plans
based on the predictive models.

100
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,549
And what are the safeguards in this?

101
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,579
This healthcare AI needs to have
end-to-end transcript encryption

102
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:55,829
role-based access controls, graphic
variance audits, because in healthcare

103
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,049
bias isn't just analytical, it's lethal.

104
00:05:59,049 --> 00:06:00,664
And what is the future of ai?

105
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:04,084
The future will demand
even more maturity from us.

106
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,834
Autonomous ai, the systems
that independently adapt and

107
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:11,704
self-correct, but always with
the human governance boundaries.

108
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:15,574
Edge, ai, moving intelligence
to where the action happens.

109
00:06:15,634 --> 00:06:20,584
It might be in phones, factories, vehicles
enhancing privacy and reducing latency.

110
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:24,364
And the next is decentralizing
infrastructure, distributor clouds,

111
00:06:24,394 --> 00:06:28,889
ecosystem, which are tamper proof,
failure, resistance, and trust enhancing.

112
00:06:29,614 --> 00:06:32,044
The question is not
will we have the system.

113
00:06:32,494 --> 00:06:34,654
It is, will they deserve our trust?

114
00:06:34,714 --> 00:06:36,544
Yes, they need to deserve trust.

115
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,594
Deeper future risks, newer threats, loom.

116
00:06:41,374 --> 00:06:44,824
So there, there's, there, there's
something called synthetic data bias

117
00:06:44,974 --> 00:06:49,864
training is on synthetic data data risks
and embedding and amplifying unseen bias.

118
00:06:50,194 --> 00:06:51,634
So what's emotion there?

119
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,254
There are a lot of emotional AI risks.

120
00:06:53,494 --> 00:06:56,304
AI systems detecting and
manipulating human emotions

121
00:06:56,364 --> 00:06:58,134
raise alarming ethical dilemmas.

122
00:06:59,034 --> 00:06:59,754
What's deep?

123
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:04,364
A deep fake profile as generative
models become better at pro producing

124
00:07:04,364 --> 00:07:05,984
synthetic tests, images, and voice.

125
00:07:06,374 --> 00:07:10,589
The challenge of dis distinction, real
versus fake is getting existential

126
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,019
AI will increasingly act first,
but must never act against us,

127
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:17,849
but which is happening right now.

128
00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:21,899
So we need to balance this
innovation with ethics.

129
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:25,774
Balancing bold innovation with
rigorous ethics requires systemization.

130
00:07:26,164 --> 00:07:28,204
It needs a proper framework for this.

131
00:07:28,354 --> 00:07:32,014
It's innovating fearlessly,
evaluate impact, thoroughly

132
00:07:32,254 --> 00:07:35,794
implement ethical safeguards,
and continuous monitor and adapt.

133
00:07:35,794 --> 00:07:39,114
And next we need to talk about
ethical ethics by design principles,

134
00:07:39,174 --> 00:07:43,999
privacy by default, bias detection
as part of standard qa expandability

135
00:07:44,154 --> 00:07:48,894
mandatory for all the critical systems,
regular, independent, and external rx.

136
00:07:49,314 --> 00:07:51,354
Ethical AI is just not a destination.

137
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:52,554
It's a dynamic journey.

138
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:59,399
So not a single team or a dependent
can can can shoulder this burden.

139
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:04,384
So trust through a ethical AI
requests executive leadership by, in

140
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:07,684
the highest level, cross-functional
product teams, which leverage the go

141
00:08:07,684 --> 00:08:12,244
product governance, multidisciplinary
advisory councils, genuine community

142
00:08:12,304 --> 00:08:13,414
and stakeholder involvement.

143
00:08:14,014 --> 00:08:16,784
The best technical systems will
just will be built just for the

144
00:08:16,784 --> 00:08:18,374
society, but for the society.

145
00:08:19,454 --> 00:08:21,554
So we need to, let's talk
about some key takeaways here.

146
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:25,849
So performance performance
analytics can and must coexist.

147
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,439
Ethical governance AC accelerates
and hinders the innovation.

148
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,809
Collaboration, diversity and transparency
will define winners in the AI era.

149
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:40,030
The systems we designed today will,
outliers, let's ensure they carry

150
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,774
forward with the best best values.

151
00:08:44,084 --> 00:08:44,564
Thank you.

152
00:08:44,714 --> 00:08:47,024
Thank you for your time, your
dedication, and your vision.

153
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,409
Innovation without ethics is empty.

154
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,469
Innovation, grounded in ethics,
that's how we change the world.

155
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:53,644
Thank you everyone.
