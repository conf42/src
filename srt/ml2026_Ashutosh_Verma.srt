1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,580
Speaker 7: Hello folks, this is Ash.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,000
I work as a software engineer in Meta.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,929
I'm located in Seattle location in
Washington, in the United States.

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:13,030
So today I'm presenting this topic,
unifying Online and Offline Worlds, a

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,509
machine learning framework for cross
channel attribution and marketing.

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:16,692
ROI.

7
00:00:17,192 --> 00:00:19,742
So we'll start with the
modern consumer journey.

8
00:00:19,922 --> 00:00:24,062
So the challenge today, consumers,
they move fluidly between digital

9
00:00:24,062 --> 00:00:28,172
and physical touch points, creating
increasingly non-linear parts to purchase.

10
00:00:28,892 --> 00:00:30,572
They research products online.

11
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:33,691
They visit stores to experience
them and engage through social

12
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:37,202
media, and ultimately they convert
through unpredictable channels.

13
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:41,552
Traditional attribution models
fails to capture this complexity.

14
00:00:42,152 --> 00:00:46,411
Leaving marketers blind to the
true drivers of conversion and ROI.

15
00:00:46,911 --> 00:00:49,131
So why the traditional
attribution falls short.

16
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:53,511
First one is channel sales,
separate analytics platforms.

17
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:57,471
They create fragmented views,
making it impossible to see our

18
00:00:57,471 --> 00:01:00,771
touch points influence each other
across the customer journey.

19
00:01:01,491 --> 00:01:03,021
Second one, linear assumptions.

20
00:01:03,412 --> 00:01:06,382
The most popular, the last click
and the first click models,

21
00:01:06,382 --> 00:01:07,971
the oversimplify reality.

22
00:01:08,556 --> 00:01:11,286
Ignoring the crucial mid
funnel interactions that

23
00:01:11,286 --> 00:01:12,727
shape purchase decisions.

24
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:17,376
And last one, the offline blind spots
point of sale data and in-person

25
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:22,987
experiences that remain disconnected from
digital behavior, creating massive gaps

26
00:01:22,987 --> 00:01:25,267
in the enter in attribution accuracy.

27
00:01:25,767 --> 00:01:27,926
So we have a unified
attribution framework.

28
00:01:28,017 --> 00:01:32,097
This is a machine learning, enables us
to bridge the online offline divide.

29
00:01:32,517 --> 00:01:38,157
By synthesizing disparate data sources
into coherent attribution model, this

30
00:01:38,157 --> 00:01:43,767
framework integrates website analytics,
social engagement, email behavior, point

31
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:48,777
of sale transactions, and in-person
transactions, interactions, revealing

32
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:51,237
pattern, invisible to traditional methods.

33
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:55,307
The core components of this framework
first one is data integration.

34
00:01:55,697 --> 00:02:00,647
We unify the touchpoint data across on all
channels into a centralized repository.

35
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:06,167
Second one, ML modeling apply advanced
algorithms to quantify channel

36
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,357
contribution and interaction effects.

37
00:02:09,137 --> 00:02:10,877
Third one, identity resolution.

38
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:14,987
We connect anonymous and known
identities to track individual

39
00:02:15,527 --> 00:02:17,267
across devices and context.

40
00:02:17,447 --> 00:02:18,797
And fourth one activation.

41
00:02:19,247 --> 00:02:22,397
We surface insights to
optimize budget allocation and

42
00:02:22,397 --> 00:02:24,077
campaign strategy in real time.

43
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:30,037
So the cross channel identity resolution,
so effective attribution begins with

44
00:02:30,097 --> 00:02:34,807
identity resolution, its ability to
recognize the same individual across

45
00:02:34,807 --> 00:02:37,357
devices, sessions, or physical location.

46
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:42,097
Probabilistic matching techniques,
combined deterministic identifiers

47
00:02:42,157 --> 00:02:45,667
with behavioral signals to
create unified customer profiles.

48
00:02:46,657 --> 00:02:47,167
This pro.

49
00:02:47,287 --> 00:02:51,637
This process involves sophisticated
graph algorithms that weigh

50
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:56,047
evidence across touch points,
balancing precision with coverage to

51
00:02:56,047 --> 00:02:58,027
maximize the attribution accuracy.

52
00:02:58,657 --> 00:03:01,237
So for the key techniques, we
have deterministic matching.

53
00:03:01,387 --> 00:03:06,667
We are logged in states istic matching,
using device fingerprints, graph

54
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:10,567
based entity resolution, and then
privacy preserving hashing methods.

55
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:12,387
Next feature.

56
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:17,127
Feature engineering transforms the raw
touchpoint data into meaningful predictors

57
00:03:17,127 --> 00:03:19,317
of conversion, temporal features.

58
00:03:19,317 --> 00:03:24,357
They capture recency and frequency while
the interaction features the model.

59
00:03:24,357 --> 00:03:27,537
Cross channel synergies that
drive purchase behavior.

60
00:03:28,037 --> 00:03:32,057
Machine learning approaches
significantly out outperform the

61
00:03:32,057 --> 00:03:33,677
rule-based attribution methods.

62
00:03:34,307 --> 00:03:39,127
Assemble models that combine gradient
boosting neural networks and survival

63
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:43,417
analysis, capture complex interaction
effects and nonlinear relationships.

64
00:03:44,017 --> 00:03:48,877
These model quantify incremental
contribution by channel while accounting

65
00:03:48,877 --> 00:03:50,707
for synergies and diminishing returns.

66
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:51,737
Next one.

67
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:57,112
The true value of unified attribution
lies in revealing cross channel synergies.

68
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:01,567
Social media engagement may not
directly drive conver conversions,

69
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:06,427
but it amplifies the effectiveness
of subsequent email campaigns by 34%.

70
00:04:07,237 --> 00:04:13,297
In-store visits proceeded by website
browsing convert at 2.8 x the rate of

71
00:04:13,297 --> 00:04:18,666
walk-ins, these interaction effects
remain invisible when channels are

72
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:23,222
analyzed independently leading to
systematic budget, location mis.

73
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,321
Next one attribution models.

74
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:28,891
They do generate value only
when insights flow directly

75
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:30,301
into the marketing decisions.

76
00:04:30,482 --> 00:04:34,982
Automated budget optimization systems
continuously relocate spend based

77
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:37,022
on the updated attribution rates.

78
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:42,301
While AB testing validates model
recommendation, campaign activation

79
00:04:42,301 --> 00:04:46,201
platforms, the integrate attribution
scores to personalize, creative

80
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:47,852
and timing across channels.

81
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:50,972
Closing the loop between
measurement and execution.

82
00:04:51,472 --> 00:04:52,042
Next, future.

83
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,962
Proving your attribution practices.

84
00:04:54,142 --> 00:04:56,302
You start with the privacy
First architecture.

85
00:04:56,392 --> 00:05:00,742
You design a system compatible with
emerging regulations through all

86
00:05:00,742 --> 00:05:05,032
device processing, federated learning
and differential privacy techniques.

87
00:05:05,452 --> 00:05:07,111
Second is adaptive modeling.

88
00:05:07,652 --> 00:05:11,431
You build continuous retraining
pipelines that are just to evolving

89
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:15,272
customer behaviors and new channel
dynamics without manual intervention.

90
00:05:15,902 --> 00:05:17,402
And third one, AI integration.

91
00:05:17,732 --> 00:05:21,602
We leverage large language models
for automated feature discovery and

92
00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:25,861
casual inference to stay ahead of
rapid advances and machine learning.

93
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:28,311
So measuring success attribution.

94
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:28,883
ROI.

95
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:34,186
Budget efficiency, gain, average
improvement in marketing, spend efficiency

96
00:05:34,186 --> 00:05:35,926
through optimized channel allocation.

97
00:05:36,496 --> 00:05:41,506
Second is ROI Improvement, typically
increase in ROI marketing investment

98
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:43,916
after implementing unified attribution.

99
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:47,516
And third one is insights
accuracy improvement in predictive

100
00:05:47,516 --> 00:05:50,846
accuracy compared to traditional
last click attribution models.

101
00:05:51,346 --> 00:05:54,526
So last your roadmap to
resilient attribution.

102
00:05:54,616 --> 00:05:59,386
You start small, begin with two channels,
and expand incrementally as capabilities.

103
00:05:59,386 --> 00:05:59,896
Mature.

104
00:06:00,496 --> 00:06:05,176
You invest in identity, prioritize
crosswise, cross context, ident

105
00:06:05,356 --> 00:06:10,006
identity resolution as your foundation,
and then build coalition, skip

106
00:06:10,006 --> 00:06:13,876
care, cross-functional support
early to overcome organizational

107
00:06:13,876 --> 00:06:16,306
behaviors, and then iterate rapidly.

108
00:06:16,786 --> 00:06:18,976
Launch an MVP measure impact.

109
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,292
Refine models based on
real world validation.

110
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:23,662
Yeah, that's all for today.

111
00:06:23,712 --> 00:06:25,801
I hope this is informative and useful.
