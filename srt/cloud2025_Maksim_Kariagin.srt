1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,710
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,350
And thank you for being here today.

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,570
So my name is Max, and I'm excited
to talk about how data science and AI

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,530
are transforming the music industry.

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,390
So I spent over 10 years
working in data science across

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,490
telecom, FinTech and consulting.

7
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,529
I also had the opportunity
to lead research and analysis

8
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,419
at Warren Music Group.

9
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,860
And now I'm science lead at Metis.

10
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,600
So the music industry is evolving
rapidly and AI is playing crucial

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,520
role is that transformation.

12
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,740
So today we'll explore how cloud
native AI is driving innovation in

13
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,930
entertainment and music production.

14
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:37,339
So now that you know a bit.

15
00:00:37,655 --> 00:00:42,254
More, about me and let me walk you
through, what we will cover today.

16
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:45,764
So before we dive into the
details here, a quick overview

17
00:00:45,764 --> 00:00:47,194
of what we will cover today.

18
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:48,944
So what is the problem?

19
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:52,975
we'll start by discussing the key
challenges the music industry faces today.

20
00:00:53,035 --> 00:00:57,435
so we'll talk about data and
understand, what the source, we have.

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,750
And, how they shape a decision making
introduction, to AI in the music industry.

22
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,940
the high level, we look at how AI is
used in various aspects of the business.

23
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,039
And, we'll make, two stops
on two, case studies.

24
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,060
So the first one, it's, uplift modeling.

25
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,540
So how AI helps optimize
marketing campaigns by

26
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,630
identifying high value audiences.

27
00:01:20,155 --> 00:01:24,435
And the second one, it's AI driven
planning and marketing, optimization.

28
00:01:24,465 --> 00:01:29,495
So we're using AI to predict
demand and optimize a budget.

29
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:34,955
And we'll talk about the impact
of AI on the music industry from

30
00:01:35,005 --> 00:01:36,885
perspective of a cloud native.

31
00:01:37,385 --> 00:01:41,995
So before we get into, let's
first break down what the music

32
00:01:41,995 --> 00:01:43,595
business actually looks like.

33
00:01:44,095 --> 00:01:47,075
So the industry operates
across five key pillars.

34
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:50,235
So the first one, it's, and
our, artists and repertoire.

35
00:01:50,295 --> 00:01:54,335
So these departments, responsible
for discovery of new talent,

36
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:56,435
finding the next big start.

37
00:01:57,035 --> 00:02:01,065
The second one, it's a recording
and, production, turning raw

38
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,285
talent into high quality music.

39
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,750
The next one, it's an
artist promotion marketing.

40
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,980
So the guys who are responsible for,
making people, more knowledgeable

41
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,260
and, actually hear the music.

42
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,730
the next one, when we already
promote our artists, our stars.

43
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,420
So we need to think about how to
release tracks and distribute that.

44
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,670
So getting music onto
streaming platforms and other.

45
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,240
Channels are of course, the
last one and, but not least.

46
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,960
So it's a step of
monetization and royalties.

47
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:37,480
So we need to ensure that artists
and labels as a warm is a group,

48
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,150
as ourselves, we get paid for the.

49
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,730
So each of these areas generates
massive amounts of data, and this is

50
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:51,200
where AI can play a huge role in making
processes more efficient and data driven.

51
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,380
But of course, this business
is not without challenges.

52
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,230
So let's talk about one
of the biggest ones.

53
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,260
we understand that AI in our
days is everywhere, but, we have.

54
00:03:03,615 --> 00:03:08,735
To do something, but, sometimes, we
don't know and labels and artists,

55
00:03:08,785 --> 00:03:14,115
know that, AI could be potential,
but the biggest challenge that, we

56
00:03:14,115 --> 00:03:19,025
faced, we don't know the artists don't
know and the labels as well, where

57
00:03:19,035 --> 00:03:21,535
and how to use it, more efficient.

58
00:03:22,175 --> 00:03:27,365
So it's not just about adopting AI, it's
about making it work for real business.

59
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:33,205
And if that was not challenging
enough, there is another big hurdle.

60
00:03:33,275 --> 00:03:34,705
so too much data.

61
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:36,445
So let's talk about it.

62
00:03:36,455 --> 00:03:40,435
So AI is everywhere, but
there is, one problem more.

63
00:03:40,465 --> 00:03:42,205
It's, data is everywhere.

64
00:03:42,225 --> 00:03:45,015
in warm music group, so we have, over.

65
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,509
2. 5 trillion streaming data points, 15,
000, parameters tracked for analysis.

66
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:56,859
hundreds of tables about the artists,
about the track, about the album,

67
00:03:56,949 --> 00:04:00,219
about the audiences, 180 companies.

68
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:06,159
Provide, different details, different data
and share this data with our music group.

69
00:04:06,529 --> 00:04:11,379
So 10 billion transaction process
daily and growing every day.

70
00:04:11,899 --> 00:04:13,639
So the problem is not having data.

71
00:04:13,649 --> 00:04:15,099
The problem is making.

72
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:16,234
Sense of it.

73
00:04:16,284 --> 00:04:20,474
and that's where AI, comes in,
but we need to know how to use it.

74
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:24,694
So where does all this
data actually come from?

75
00:04:25,054 --> 00:04:27,954
So the first, main source, it's a DSP.

76
00:04:27,994 --> 00:04:33,044
It's a digital streaming
platform such as, Apple Music.

77
00:04:33,414 --> 00:04:35,634
Spotify, Amazon and YouTube.

78
00:04:35,974 --> 00:04:39,344
So they provide insights into
user behavior, play counts,

79
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:41,384
skips and playlist, additions.

80
00:04:41,884 --> 00:04:44,694
So of course, the most, one
of the most popular source

81
00:04:44,704 --> 00:04:46,074
of data, it's a chart metric.

82
00:04:46,124 --> 00:04:49,744
So chart metric is a tool that tracks
fun engagement across, different

83
00:04:49,744 --> 00:04:54,374
platforms, the technical and, from.

84
00:04:54,614 --> 00:04:58,904
Technician sites, we could talk about,
Librosa, so it's a non obvious, but

85
00:04:58,934 --> 00:05:01,864
anyway, it's a one more source of, data.

86
00:05:01,904 --> 00:05:06,754
Librosa, it's a Python library for
analyzing audio features, so it provides,

87
00:05:06,754 --> 00:05:10,774
extraction, useful information like
tempo, pitch, and mood from tracks.

88
00:05:11,764 --> 00:05:13,984
And also we use, SATATON.

89
00:05:13,984 --> 00:05:15,924
SATATON is a data platform, which we use.

90
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,769
To identify rising stars, it combines,
streaming, social and radio data

91
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:22,619
to predict, breakthrough artists.

92
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:26,539
So now we actually understand
the data landscape.

93
00:05:26,549 --> 00:05:30,319
So let's see how AI helps
solve real business problems.

94
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:34,309
So AI is solving two key types of
problems in the music industry.

95
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:36,899
It's, two different layers.

96
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:38,539
the first one it's operations.

97
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:42,899
And strategy, the second one, the
operations are responsible for

98
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:44,729
optimizing marketing and engagement.

99
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:48,589
it's a problem such as, segmentation,
A B testing, common channel marketing.

100
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:54,599
If we talk about strategy, it's a
separate division, which driving

101
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:58,679
business decisions, such as, stream
forecasting, churn prediction,

102
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:01,249
LTV modeling, and uplift modeling.

103
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,839
So each streaming, service.

104
00:06:04,374 --> 00:06:09,104
Spotify, Apple music, YouTube keeps
its own, data and the main, one

105
00:06:09,104 --> 00:06:14,464
of the main problems, we faced,
we can't track a listener across,

106
00:06:14,494 --> 00:06:19,164
platforms, which limits how well
we understand individual behavior.

107
00:06:19,524 --> 00:06:22,624
So that's why uplift modeling
and stream forecasting are

108
00:06:22,624 --> 00:06:24,604
one of our key focus areas.

109
00:06:25,004 --> 00:06:30,264
So it helps us measure and,
real campaign, despite.

110
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,214
These, limitations.

111
00:06:32,614 --> 00:06:36,254
So let's look at how AI
supports the listener journey.

112
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:40,634
So AI supports every step of the listener
journey, started from, acquisition.

113
00:06:40,684 --> 00:06:41,474
So acquisition.

114
00:06:41,974 --> 00:06:46,004
It's a step which, led us to
understand who are the new listeners.

115
00:06:46,054 --> 00:06:49,224
it's more about behavior
monitoring, onboarding, ideas

116
00:06:49,244 --> 00:06:50,594
and the boarding strategies.

117
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:54,174
So the second one, it's a
development, the development.

118
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:58,439
Part, it's about how do
we keep them engaged.

119
00:06:58,549 --> 00:07:02,259
it's a problem, which we're going
to address such as next best offer

120
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:04,379
or cross sell or up sell model.

121
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:06,719
The third one, it's a retention.

122
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:11,259
So when we already have the
user is, using our service.

123
00:07:11,549 --> 00:07:16,639
we need to think about who's at risk
of living and responsible for, churn

124
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,579
and think about, LTV prediction.

125
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:21,299
And the last one, it's a reactivation.

126
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:23,149
how do we bring them back?

127
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:28,399
for example, if we found that the user
had a high churn, probability, and it's

128
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,559
a problem like a reactivation modeling.

129
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:31,929
or incentives.

130
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:37,459
So to tackle these challenges, we
focus on two key AI applications.

131
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:42,159
Uplift modeling for smarter marketing
and sales forecasting to predict demand.

132
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,379
Because these, two main problems.

133
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:50,449
Cover the main, part of our business.

134
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,229
So let's see how app uplift modeling
helps optimize marketing expense.

135
00:07:55,749 --> 00:08:00,859
So basically, app uplift modeling help us,
measure the real impact of, advertising

136
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:03,019
and the optimize budget allocation.

137
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:09,129
So we analyze two groups, the user
who saw an ad and those, who did not.

138
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:10,124
So two A models.

139
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:15,844
Predict engagement for each group
and uplift is the difference

140
00:08:15,854 --> 00:08:17,274
between these predictions.

141
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:22,024
It tell us where ads actually drive
more listens or clicks instead of

142
00:08:22,024 --> 00:08:24,264
spending on user who would engage.

143
00:08:24,294 --> 00:08:28,114
Anyway, we focus on those, where
ads make a real difference.

144
00:08:28,564 --> 00:08:34,494
so maximizing impact and reducing wasted
spend actually what happens when we

145
00:08:34,494 --> 00:08:37,024
apply uplift modeling in real campaigns.

146
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:42,519
So AI driven segmentation was used
to launch ads on TikTok and Spotify.

147
00:08:42,749 --> 00:08:46,659
So the results showed a 30 percent
reduction in the cost of adding a

148
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,999
track to a user library compared
to traditional segmentation.

149
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:55,219
So this proves that AI, especially
uplift modeling could help us

150
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,289
optimize ad spend by targeting.

151
00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:01,789
The right, listeners and improved,
efficiency and reducing, costs.

152
00:09:01,869 --> 00:09:04,039
That's actually our main purposes.

153
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:12,089
So now let's take a look, at another
key AI, use case in our agenda.

154
00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:15,379
It must be, and it will
be stream forecasting.

155
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:19,289
So stream forecasting, it's about,
Sales forecasting, actually.

156
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:24,799
So we need to predict how many
times a song, will be streamed as

157
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,359
a critical for plan because it's
critical for planning and marketing.

158
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:32,439
We built a three months forecasting
model using historical streaming

159
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:36,659
trends, track metadata and the process,
which we already mentioned today.

160
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:41,489
And additionally, we used,
around 700 features in total.

161
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:46,429
So the result forecasting
accuracy improved by 60%.

162
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:52,049
helping labels, allocate budgets
more effectively because, it's

163
00:09:52,109 --> 00:09:55,119
becoming more crucial and more
important for warrior because warrior

164
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:59,719
consists of different, independent
label, such as Atlantic as well.

165
00:10:00,219 --> 00:10:03,449
So now let's see how this
forecasting translates into a

166
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:05,619
smarter marketing investments.

167
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:08,839
So forecasting doesn't
just help predict streams.

168
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:14,689
It's also optimize marketing spend
because, when we build, model, we

169
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:20,649
need to understand that we need to
not only implement our solution.

170
00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:22,249
We need to interpret.

171
00:10:23,004 --> 00:10:25,174
the decision interpret, the model.

172
00:10:25,264 --> 00:10:30,004
And, for that to answer on that
question, we built partial dependence

173
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:34,674
plot and partial dependence
plot, provide us key insight.

174
00:10:34,674 --> 00:10:39,904
So more budget does not always
mean more streams because, after.

175
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:44,379
built in partial dependence, we found
that, oftentimes we're faced with a

176
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:50,009
plateau effect and plot effect shows where
additional spending stop being effective.

177
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:54,649
So by reallocating budgets
based on these, insights.

178
00:10:54,689 --> 00:11:00,649
So we saved, 27 percent of, marketing
costs without losing performance.

179
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:04,319
And, we've built based on that model.

180
00:11:04,684 --> 00:11:08,524
real cloud native AI platform
that integrates forecasting

181
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,184
seamlessly into business process.

182
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:18,774
So the first step, of our implementation,
it's a front end around on

183
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:21,144
Streamlit, which making predictions.

184
00:11:21,524 --> 00:11:26,114
And, provide for, our business
units and business users more easy

185
00:11:26,174 --> 00:11:27,914
to access, mathematical model.

186
00:11:28,414 --> 00:11:34,724
And the next step, a fast API backend
connects the user interface with our ML

187
00:11:34,724 --> 00:11:37,484
model and handling request efficiently.

188
00:11:37,984 --> 00:11:38,694
So user.

189
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:41,764
Type specific, scenario in Streamlit.

190
00:11:41,794 --> 00:11:44,184
So Streamlit send this request to FastAPI.

191
00:11:44,214 --> 00:11:50,504
FastAPI launch ML model, ML model
score and predict all forecasts.

192
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:53,234
Send this forecast, in FastAPI back.

193
00:11:53,844 --> 00:11:56,364
And, the model process
input features and return.

194
00:11:56,874 --> 00:11:59,984
stream forecasts, in the
real time and show the real

195
00:12:00,014 --> 00:12:02,644
forecasts in the stream lead.

196
00:12:03,054 --> 00:12:10,224
So this architecture allows for fast
scalable AI driven decision making and

197
00:12:10,234 --> 00:12:13,004
bringing real value to the music industry.

198
00:12:13,504 --> 00:12:16,834
And, at the end of the day, it
all comes down to one thing.

199
00:12:16,974 --> 00:12:18,554
So music has to win.

200
00:12:19,064 --> 00:12:23,434
AI is not here to replace
creativity, but to amplify it,

201
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,344
helping artists and businesses.

202
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:28,549
Make smarter and data driven decisions.

203
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:34,909
And, our purpose and our main
objective, is build cloud native AI

204
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:39,889
solution that optimize marketing,
predict trends and maximize impact.

205
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:45,107
And we did it, but the real goal, of
course, it's connecting music with the

206
00:12:45,107 --> 00:12:47,413
right audience in the most effective way.

207
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:52,249
