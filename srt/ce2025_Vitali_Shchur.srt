00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,060
Hello, welcome to today's
presentation on the QA ownership

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,180
mindset driving startup success.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,699
In this session, we will explore
how adopting the, how adopting a

4
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:18,269
QA ownership mindset can accelerate
product success, foster better

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,069
collaboration, and ultimately
drive quality outcomes in startups.

6
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:28,949
Let's dive into the key concepts that
will help startups thrive through

7
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,209
integrated, integrated quality process.

8
00:00:31,709 --> 00:00:33,829
Why is quality important for startups?

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,970
Startup success depends on building
reliable products that users can trust.

10
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:44,860
Quality ensures longevity, customer
retention, and reduced maintenance costs.

11
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:50,190
How a strong QA ownership mindset
accelerates product success.

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,140
QA must be integrated into every
stage of product development,

13
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,460
not just as a final check.

14
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,290
For today's case, Sims will focus
on collaboration automation and

15
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:08,390
continuous improvement principles
that will help, you to scale quality

16
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,250
through your start your startup.

17
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:11,350
Okay.

18
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:18,760
Next, why QA matters in startups draw
a lot of myths about QA in startups.

19
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,415
Common startup, miss,
is testing slow us down.

20
00:01:23,385 --> 00:01:26,205
QA is only for finding bugs at the end.

21
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:31,375
this means it can be dangerous because
poor quality costs startups delay.

22
00:01:32,155 --> 00:01:38,875
bugs in production, the bugs in
production, which are damage reputation.

23
00:01:39,335 --> 00:01:42,875
And, high churn rate can result
from bad user experience.

24
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:47,705
That's why shifting QA left
is very important, is crucial.

25
00:01:48,365 --> 00:01:51,365
QA should be integrated into
development from the start.

26
00:01:51,865 --> 00:01:56,785
When QA is a part of the development
from the start, issues are caught sooner,

27
00:01:56,875 --> 00:02:00,405
saving the time and money on the long run.

28
00:02:00,905 --> 00:02:02,544
what is the QA ownership mindset?

29
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:06,514
QA is a shared responsibility,
not just a role.

30
00:02:07,014 --> 00:02:09,514
How it differs from
traditional QA approach?

31
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:14,434
Traditional QA works as a separate
function, owner, but ownership

32
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:16,824
integrates QA into every role.

33
00:02:17,324 --> 00:02:21,324
Impact of ownership on team
efficiency and product reliability.

34
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:25,704
It increases communication and
collaboration, leading to faster

35
00:02:25,704 --> 00:02:27,224
and more reliable development.

36
00:02:27,724 --> 00:02:32,129
Everyone in this team has a role
in ensuring quality, not just

37
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:35,644
those with QA in their job title.

38
00:02:36,144 --> 00:02:42,894
For example, if we have some deadline,
even developers can take part in

39
00:02:42,894 --> 00:02:44,484
testing in the full regression.

40
00:02:44,524 --> 00:02:51,064
If you have test cases, they can help
you with, This is not for everyday

41
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,804
use, but sometimes it's a good idea.

42
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:55,554
Okay, moving.

43
00:02:56,054 --> 00:02:58,194
The three pillars of QA ownership.

44
00:02:58,764 --> 00:03:03,114
To make QA ownership a success,
we focus on three key pillars.

45
00:03:03,614 --> 00:03:07,744
It's collaboration ensures all
teams are accountable for quality.

46
00:03:08,544 --> 00:03:12,794
It is automation, which reduces manual
testing and increasing efficiency.

47
00:03:12,804 --> 00:03:13,079
Thank you for listening.

48
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:15,559
It's continuous improvement.

49
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,859
It's learning from failures
to refined processes.

50
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:23,809
These pillars work together
to create a robust, efficient,

51
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:25,339
and quality focused team,

52
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:29,059
building a QA deriving
culture in startups.

53
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:33,689
we can do it by integrating QA into
every stage of the development lifecycle.

54
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:38,549
We need to encourage all team
members, developers, product managers,

55
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:41,349
and other roles to own quality.

56
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:41,409
Thank you.

57
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:46,179
Everyone should be aware and remember
about quality and user experience.

58
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:52,479
Creating a quality first mindset without
slowing down innovation is possible.

59
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:55,839
Quality doesn't need to slow
down the development process

60
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:57,509
if integrated properly.

61
00:03:58,009 --> 00:03:58,859
15 left.

62
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:00,899
Testing early and often.

63
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:06,149
QA is not just about testing, it
plays a crucial role in validating

64
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:08,239
requirements before development begins.

65
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:14,069
If requirements are unclear or incorrect,
developers may build the wrong features,

66
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:16,659
leading to waste of time and resources.

67
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,229
QA acts as a second line of defense,
ensuring that what's being developed

68
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,149
aligns with business goals and user needs.

69
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:29,529
This proactive approach prevents
costly mistakes before they happen.

70
00:04:29,859 --> 00:04:33,879
Making QA a strategic function
in product development.

71
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:35,189
Next.

72
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:38,409
QA as a business analyst, why it's matter.

73
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:42,969
Poorly defined requirements can
lead to major issues in development.

74
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,499
QA should catch these
pitfalls earlier as possible.

75
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:54,439
we need to check the requirements for
the ambiguous language, words like

76
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,899
fast or secure need clear definition.

77
00:04:57,809 --> 00:04:59,859
We need to check for
conflicting requirements.

78
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:03,949
Sometimes business expectations
don't match technical feasibility

79
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:06,499
and how our system is designed.

80
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:17,139
We need to check for missing edge
cases, because overlooking rare but

81
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:22,659
critical user scenarios can cause
unexpected failures, and we need to

82
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:24,409
check for incorrect business logic.

83
00:05:25,384 --> 00:05:28,974
Assumptions that don't match
real world behavior can lead

84
00:05:28,974 --> 00:05:30,554
to a poor user experience.

85
00:05:31,054 --> 00:05:31,914
Next.

86
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:36,764
Common requirements, pitfalls,
which QA should catch.

87
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:41,324
In order to ensure high quality
product development, QA professionals

88
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:43,144
must go beyond basic testing.

89
00:05:43,584 --> 00:05:47,654
and take a proactive approach
to requirement analysis.

90
00:05:48,244 --> 00:05:54,284
Here are four key techniques QA can
use to straighten requirements analysis

91
00:05:54,304 --> 00:05:56,914
and catch potential issues earlier.

92
00:05:57,414 --> 00:05:58,594
We need to ask what if.

93
00:05:58,594 --> 00:06:04,254
We need to challenge assumptions
and consider edge cases.

94
00:06:04,934 --> 00:06:11,094
We need to map user journeys,
visualize user interactions

95
00:06:11,354 --> 00:06:13,074
to identify inconsistencies.

96
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:15,774
We need to compare with
industry standards.

97
00:06:16,254 --> 00:06:18,774
Benchmark against best practices.

98
00:06:19,274 --> 00:06:20,154
Benchmark.

99
00:06:20,754 --> 00:06:22,454
Collaborate with stakeholders.

100
00:06:22,744 --> 00:06:26,444
We need to validate logic with
developers and product managers.

101
00:06:26,944 --> 00:06:29,714
Techniques to analyze requirements
like a business analyst.

102
00:06:29,714 --> 00:06:35,674
QA professionals can analyze requirements
more effectively using these techniques.

103
00:06:36,494 --> 00:06:39,984
Ask proactive questions instead
of waiting for issues to arise.

104
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:44,604
We need to stay updated on industry
trends to anticipate potential risks.

105
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:50,389
We need to communicate effectively
between business, development, and users.

106
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:53,229
We need to take ethical responsibility.

107
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,019
QA is about preventing
failures, not just finding bugs.

108
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:01,329
By thinking like a business
analyst, QA can ensure clarity and

109
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:03,289
alignment before development starts.

110
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:06,229
Role of developers in QA ownership.

111
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:09,439
Quality is not just QA responsibility.

112
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,999
Developers must actively contribute to it.

113
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:17,199
Developers should write unit and
integration tests to catch issues earlier.

114
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:21,289
Pairing QA engineers with
developers fosters collaboration

115
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:23,149
and improves test coverage.

116
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:27,769
The best teams understand that
quality is a shared responsibility,

117
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:29,449
not a separate phase.

118
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,559
The role of automation in QA ownership.

119
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:37,679
Automated tests help teams iterate
quickly without sacrificing quality.

120
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,849
However, a balance must be maintained.

121
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,619
Not everything should be automated.

122
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:46,009
Continuous testing in CI CD pipelines.

123
00:07:46,609 --> 00:07:51,979
Integrating QA into CI CD, continuous
integration, continuous deployment,

124
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:53,879
ensures faster feedback loops.

125
00:07:54,799 --> 00:08:01,499
So for this, we can use API tests
using Postman, Selenium, automation

126
00:08:01,499 --> 00:08:05,969
with Selenium, Cypress, Playwright,
handling bugs and failures with the

127
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:09,049
QA ownership mindset.

128
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:13,689
With the QA ownership mindset,
we focus on having strong bug

129
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:15,269
tracking and triage process.

130
00:08:15,784 --> 00:08:18,884
to ensure issues are dealt with promptly.

131
00:08:19,514 --> 00:08:24,924
Learning from post mortem allows teams
to improve their systems continuously and

132
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:28,344
build resilience against future failures.

133
00:08:28,844 --> 00:08:32,504
Automation tests should run in every
stage of the development pipeline.

134
00:08:33,174 --> 00:08:36,964
This helps teams detect issues
before deployment, preventing

135
00:08:37,044 --> 00:08:38,224
last minute surprises.

136
00:08:39,044 --> 00:08:43,314
and well implemented CI CD process
removes testing bottlenecks

137
00:08:43,354 --> 00:08:45,344
and enables rapid releases.

138
00:08:45,844 --> 00:08:50,054
Bugs are inevitable, but how
we handle them is what matters.

139
00:08:50,554 --> 00:08:52,234
Measuring QA success.

140
00:08:52,844 --> 00:08:57,944
To ensure QA efforts are effective,
we need to track key metrics

141
00:08:57,974 --> 00:09:00,364
by asking, these questions.

142
00:09:00,864 --> 00:09:02,484
Defect leakage rate.

143
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:04,944
How many defects escape to production?

144
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:06,304
Test coverage.

145
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,614
Are all crucial scenarios
being tested or not?

146
00:09:10,444 --> 00:09:11,374
Deployment stability.

147
00:09:11,874 --> 00:09:15,284
Are releases smooth or do
they introduce frequent bugs?

148
00:09:15,784 --> 00:09:19,504
By using data deriving insights,
teams can continuously optimize

149
00:09:19,504 --> 00:09:21,024
their quality assurance strategies.

150
00:09:21,024 --> 00:09:23,314
Actionable

151
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,634
steps for startups to foster QA ownership.

152
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,799
Here are two practical steps
that startups can implement

153
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,899
immediately to foster QA ownership.

154
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:36,519
Encourage collaboration between
developers, QA engineers,

155
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:37,659
and product managers.

156
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:43,329
Also, we can create a sustainable
QA ownership model that works

157
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,039
in our fast moving environment.

158
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:50,309
These steps will help build the culture
of quality through your organization.

159
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:53,509
let's move to the conclusion
and final thoughts.

160
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:58,619
In conclusion, QA ownership is a team
effort that drives startup success.

161
00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:02,449
By integrating QA into every
stage of development, you foster

162
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:06,599
collaboration, enhance efficiency,
and ensure a reliable product.

163
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:11,719
I encourage you to take action and embed
quality into your startup's culture.

164
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:12,659
Thank you.

165
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:13,919
Thank you for listening.

166
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,169
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask.
