1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,150
Good.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,440
Good morning.

3
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,910
Good afternoon everyone.

4
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,770
Thank you for being here.

5
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,780
My name is Weber Vanel vra, and I'm
a senior technical account manager

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,330
working at Amazon Web Services.

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,600
I'm really excited to talk to you today
about a topic that's become increasingly

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,610
critical in a interconnected world.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,070
Zero trust, security.

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,590
The title of my talk is Zero
Trust Security From Perimeter

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,940
Defense to Continuous Verification
in the Modern Enterprise.

12
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:38,200
For decades, our approach to
cybersecurity was largely based on a

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,380
model we often call the Castle and Moat.

14
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:48,220
We built strong parameters, our firewalls
and intrusion detection systems.

15
00:00:49,105 --> 00:00:50,725
To keep the bad guys out.

16
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:57,055
Once you were inside of that parameter,
within the corporate network, there was

17
00:00:57,055 --> 00:01:00,085
a significant amount of implicit trust.

18
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,740
We assumed that anything inside
was safe, but here's the reality.

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,900
The digital landscape has changed
dramatically with the rise of cloud

20
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:16,660
computing, mobile workforces, connecting
from anywhere on any device and

21
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,000
complex supply chain integrations.

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,500
Those traditional network boundaries
have essentially dissolved.

23
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:29,170
The moat has dried up, and the castle
walls have crumbled in many places.

24
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:34,390
This is why Zero Trust isn't
just a new buzzword or a product

25
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,890
you can buy off the shelf.

26
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:43,630
It's a fundamental paring shift in how
we think about security at its heart.

27
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,320
Zero trust eliminates that implicit trust.

28
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,640
It demands.

29
00:01:48,645 --> 00:01:53,265
Continuous verification for
every interaction on the network,

30
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:57,075
regardless of where it originates.

31
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:02,985
Whether you are inside the traditional
network or outside, you have to prove

32
00:02:02,985 --> 00:02:08,505
who you are and that you are authorized
to access a resource every single time.

33
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,220
Over the next few minutes, we'll explore
the evolution that brought us here, the

34
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:21,220
core principles of Zero Trust, why it's
so important right now, its key components

35
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,110
and where this approach is headed.

36
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,940
To understand where we are growing.

37
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,370
It helps to look at where we've been.

38
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,700
Security models don't just
appear out of nowhere.

39
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,950
They evolve in response to changes in
technology and the threat landscape.

40
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,740
Think back to the traditional model.

41
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,490
As I mentioned, this was
our castle and moat era.

42
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,580
We focused heavily on the parameter.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,360
Our main defenses were at
the edge of the network.

44
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:56,270
Inside things were relatively
open based on that implicit trust.

45
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,990
This work to a degree, when
most of our valuable, we're

46
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,310
at the edge of that network.

47
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,320
And.

48
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:08,255
Also, it worked to a degree when most
of our valuable assets and users were

49
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:10,025
inside that well-defined boundary.

50
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:15,425
It created a clear sense of trusted
and untrusted zones, but then

51
00:03:15,605 --> 00:03:17,465
came the digital transformation.

52
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:20,135
I. And this was a game changer.

53
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:26,225
Organizations embraced cloud
computing, moving applications and data

54
00:03:26,225 --> 00:03:28,385
outside the traditional data center.

55
00:03:28,955 --> 00:03:35,225
Our employees became mobile, working from
homes, coffee shops, airports, accessing

56
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:37,505
corporate resources from devices.

57
00:03:37,715 --> 00:03:42,845
We didn't control the internet of
things, or IOT added countless new

58
00:03:42,845 --> 00:03:45,335
devices connecting to our networks.

59
00:03:45,905 --> 00:03:49,595
These changes shattered,
those clear we control,

60
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:56,015
and these changes shattered those
clear parameters and exposed

61
00:03:56,015 --> 00:04:00,755
critical vulnerabilities because
our security still relied heavily

62
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:05,075
on those new porous boundaries
and that internal implicit trust.

63
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,900
This is what led to zero trust emergence.

64
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,580
Security professionals realized we
couldn't simply patch the old model.

65
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,150
We need a completely different philosophy.

66
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,080
The principle that
emerged was never trust.

67
00:04:21,425 --> 00:04:22,655
Always verify.

68
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:28,355
This means we don't trust any user,
device, or connection inherently,

69
00:04:28,985 --> 00:04:33,875
regardless of where they are
located or originate on the network.

70
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:40,655
Every single access attempt needs to be
authenticated and authorized continuously.

71
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,530
Moving forward, let's drill down
into that foundational principle.

72
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,080
Never trust, always verify.

73
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,740
It's simple in concept, but
profound in implication.

74
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,570
Built on a few key pillars.

75
00:04:57,135 --> 00:05:01,455
Firstly, and perhaps most critically
is continuous verification.

76
00:05:02,115 --> 00:05:08,355
This means that every time something, a
user, a device, an application, tries to

77
00:05:08,355 --> 00:05:13,095
access a resource, we treat that request
as if it could be potentially hostile,

78
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,065
even if they were verified a minute ago.

79
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,560
We don't implicitly trust
them for the next very access.

80
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:27,420
This requires robust identification
verification mechanisms for all entities.

81
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,020
It's not just about logging in once.

82
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,340
It's about validating access
for each specific interaction.

83
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,800
Secondly, we have least privilege access.

84
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:45,380
This is about granting entities only the
absolute minimum permissions they need

85
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,690
to perform their legitimate function.

86
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,670
If a user only needs to read a
specific document, they shouldn't

87
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,950
have right access to other systems.

88
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:01,640
This limits the potential, the blast
radius if an account is compromised.

89
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:02,975
An attacker.

90
00:06:02,975 --> 00:06:08,075
Gaining access to an account with
least privilege is far less damaging

91
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:10,355
than one with excessive privileges.

92
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,870
Thirdly, comprehensive monitoring.

93
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,330
In a zero trust model, you need
visibility into everything that's

94
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:26,060
happening across your network and
systems, all traffic, all access

95
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,750
attempts, all users and device behaviors.

96
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,940
This constant monitoring and analysis
is essential for detecting potential

97
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:40,100
threats, whether they originate from
outside or from inside the network.

98
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,830
Without this visibility, you cannot
effectively verify and respond.

99
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:53,990
In this slide, we will see why the shift
to zero trust not just a good idea,

100
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,420
but absolutely is essential right now.

101
00:06:57,155 --> 00:07:02,525
The factors driving it are the
realities of our modern IT environments.

102
00:07:03,185 --> 00:07:08,345
Cloud computing means that our
application and data are distributed.

103
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:14,945
They live in on-premise data centers in
one or more public clouds and corporate

104
00:07:14,945 --> 00:07:17,435
networks, increasingly at the edge.

105
00:07:18,185 --> 00:07:23,105
Securing this distributed landscape
with a single parameter is impossible.

106
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:26,885
The mobile workflows is here to stay.

107
00:07:27,245 --> 00:07:31,055
People work from anywhere
using a variety of devices.

108
00:07:31,295 --> 00:07:34,985
We can't rely on them being
inside a secure corporate network.

109
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:39,455
Access needs to be secured
regardless of location or device.

110
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,350
Supply chain integration, it means
our partners and vendors often need

111
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,210
access to our systems and data.

112
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,900
This creates complex interdependencies and
expands the network of who needs access.

113
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,195
Securing these connections based
on old trust models is risky.

114
00:07:59,705 --> 00:08:05,225
All of these factors contribute to a
significantly expanded attack surface.

115
00:08:05,645 --> 00:08:09,905
There are more ways for sophisticated
threat actors to gain unauthorized

116
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:12,035
access than ever before.

117
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:17,795
Zero Trust is designed to address
this expanded surface by focusing

118
00:08:17,795 --> 00:08:22,835
security controls closer to the
resources being accessed, rather

119
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:27,425
than relying on a parameter that
no longer effectively exists.

120
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,570
Let's see.

121
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,850
It's worth briefly
touching on the history.

122
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:36,570
The concept of Zero Trust
wasn't born overnight.

123
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:40,980
It really began with a recognition
of parameter limitations.

124
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,750
Security professionals observed
that once attackers bypass the

125
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,045
traditional parameter defenses.

126
00:08:47,955 --> 00:08:52,125
They could often move laterally
throughout the internal network with

127
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:56,505
very little resistance because of that
implicit trust that I talked earlier,

128
00:08:57,165 --> 00:08:59,295
this was a major vulnerability.

129
00:08:59,295 --> 00:08:59,985
Understood.

130
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:05,325
This recognition was often a direct
response to sophisticated attacks.

131
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:09,585
We saw attacks that successfully
breached the parameter and then

132
00:09:09,585 --> 00:09:13,065
lingered undetected inside the networks.

133
00:09:13,365 --> 00:09:17,145
For extended periods
causing significant damage.

134
00:09:17,595 --> 00:09:22,455
This highlighted the failure of
relying solely on parameter security.

135
00:09:23,025 --> 00:09:26,205
So the conceptual shift happened.

136
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,300
Instead of focusing on where the access
requests came from inside or outside,

137
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:39,990
the new thinking was to verify who and
what was making the request and what

138
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:45,840
they were trying to access, regardless
of their location, it was about verifying

139
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,150
everything before granting excess.

140
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,300
The birth of zero trust idea.

141
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,440
Let's revisit these core principles
because they are the foundation upon

142
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,745
which a zero trust architecture is built.

143
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:05,800
Firstly, authentication and
authorization for all traffic.

144
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,660
This is non-negotiable.

145
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,320
Every single connection,
every data request must be

146
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,150
authenticated and authorized.

147
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,230
Identity becomes the primary
security control point.

148
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,300
The new parameter, if you will.

149
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,690
Secondly, micro-segmentation.

150
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,380
This is a critical technique
to limit lateral movement.

151
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:33,190
Instead of having large flat networks,
we divide them into small isolator zones.

152
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,630
If one segment is compromised,
the attacker can't easily hop

153
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,100
to other parts of the network.

154
00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:44,545
It drastically limits the potential
blast radius of an incident.

155
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:50,755
Thirdly, dynamic policy
enforcement security policies

156
00:10:50,755 --> 00:10:53,605
in zero trust are not static.

157
00:10:54,595 --> 00:10:59,425
They are continuously evaluated
based on a variety of risk factors.

158
00:10:59,755 --> 00:11:04,375
During the session, is the
user's device compliant?

159
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,010
Is their location unusual
is their behavior.

160
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:15,100
Typical policies adapt based on
this ongoing assessment, not just

161
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,020
a one-time authentication event.

162
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,710
And finally, comprehensive
monitoring occur.

163
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,030
This principle underpins everything.

164
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:30,760
You need deep visibility into all
networks, activities, to enforce

165
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:36,550
policies effectively, detect threats,
and respond quickly to incidents.

166
00:11:36,635 --> 00:11:36,755
I.

167
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:42,955
This next slide really
highlights the contrast between

168
00:11:42,955 --> 00:11:45,115
the old way and the new way.

169
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:47,815
Look at the traditional security model.

170
00:11:48,025 --> 00:11:51,475
Its primary focus was on
building that strong parameter.

171
00:11:52,405 --> 00:11:55,585
Inside the networks we're really open.

172
00:11:56,155 --> 00:12:01,885
This created those distinct, often overly
simplified, trusted, and untrusted zones.

173
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,010
A major drawback was that it
granted excessive privileges

174
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:10,360
once a user authenticated at the
parameter and was inside of it.

175
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:16,225
It also often resulted in security
controls being implemented inconsistently

176
00:12:16,225 --> 00:12:20,455
across different parts of the
environment, and as resources migrated

177
00:12:20,455 --> 00:12:25,495
between on premises and the cloud,
these parameter cloud-based control

178
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:28,435
created significant protection gaps.

179
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:34,165
Now, compared that to zero trust
architecture, the fundamental

180
00:12:34,165 --> 00:12:37,285
starting point is assume a breach.

181
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:43,705
We operate as if a threat actor
could already be inside or could

182
00:12:43,705 --> 00:12:45,655
compromise any connection attempt.

183
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:50,785
Because of this, we implement
consistent verification processes

184
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:55,225
for all access requests, regardless
of their source or location.

185
00:12:55,765 --> 00:13:00,895
The focus now shifts from securing the
network segment to protecting the resource

186
00:13:00,895 --> 00:13:03,790
itself, the data, the application.

187
00:13:04,795 --> 00:13:10,675
Every single access is verified based
on multiple factors, user identity,

188
00:13:10,855 --> 00:13:13,855
device posture, context, et cetera.

189
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:20,575
This approach ensures consistent security
enforcement across all environments,

190
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:26,755
whether it is on prem, in the cloud, or
accessing resources from a remote device.

191
00:13:27,755 --> 00:13:32,075
Implementing Zero Trust requires
building a security architecture with

192
00:13:32,135 --> 00:13:34,595
several key components working together.

193
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:38,405
First, you need robust
identity verification.

194
00:13:38,645 --> 00:13:39,755
This is foundational.

195
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:44,465
You must be able to strongly
authenticate both user identities.

196
00:13:44,685 --> 00:13:48,765
And device identities before
making any access decisions.

197
00:13:49,275 --> 00:13:54,045
This goes beyond passwords and often
involves multifactor authentication,

198
00:13:54,315 --> 00:13:58,905
behavioral biometrics, and verifying
the security posture of the device.

199
00:13:59,615 --> 00:14:01,955
Next is microsegmentation.

200
00:14:02,195 --> 00:14:04,115
We've talked about its importance.

201
00:14:04,355 --> 00:14:08,435
This requires technologies that
allow you to create those granular

202
00:14:08,435 --> 00:14:13,565
network divisions to isolate sensitive
resources within protected zones.

203
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,085
This prevents the lateral movement.

204
00:14:17,045 --> 00:14:19,925
Then this security information management.

205
00:14:20,765 --> 00:14:25,835
Unique systems like the CM platforms
that provide comprehensive visibility

206
00:14:25,835 --> 00:14:30,665
by collecting and identifying potential
threats through behavioral analysis.

207
00:14:31,355 --> 00:14:34,535
Finally, you need policy
enforcement points.

208
00:14:34,835 --> 00:14:38,585
These are control mechanisms situated
throughout your architecture.

209
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:43,625
They could be security gateways,
proxy servers, next generation

210
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:48,815
firewalls, or host base agents that
evaluate every access request against

211
00:14:48,815 --> 00:14:50,705
your defined security policies.

212
00:14:51,365 --> 00:14:55,565
These decisions are based on all
the factors we've discussed, who the

213
00:14:55,565 --> 00:14:57,785
user is, what device they're using.

214
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,540
Where they are, what resource
they're trying to access, and

215
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,635
the current risk assessment.

216
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:04,565
Moving ahead.

217
00:15:04,685 --> 00:15:09,665
Let's spend a moment more on lease
privilege as it's a cornerstone.

218
00:15:09,935 --> 00:15:12,245
It's not just about basic access rights.

219
00:15:12,365 --> 00:15:14,675
It involves more dynamic approaches.

220
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:19,625
Just in time access means providing
elevated privileges only for the

221
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:24,575
specific task that requires it and
only for the duration of that task.

222
00:15:24,905 --> 00:15:28,050
This significantly reduces
the window of the opportunity.

223
00:15:28,465 --> 00:15:32,425
That an attacker has to misuse
the elevated permissions.

224
00:15:33,385 --> 00:15:39,895
Attribute based controls allows
for dynamic access decisions based

225
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:44,815
on a wide range of contextual
factors beyond just the user's role.

226
00:15:45,355 --> 00:15:49,285
Things like the device health,
location, time of delay, and the

227
00:15:49,285 --> 00:15:51,490
sensitivity of the data being accessed.

228
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:57,185
Identity governance is the ongoing
process of reviewing and managing user

229
00:15:57,215 --> 00:15:59,045
identities and their access rights.

230
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,510
Are the assigned
permissions still necessary?

231
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,580
Have any rules changed?

232
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,270
This helps ensure that the
principle of least privilege

233
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,130
is maintained over the time.

234
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,620
Ultimately, it all boils down to
ensuring that users and systems

235
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,000
only have the minimum necessary
permissions required to perform their

236
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,370
legitimate functions and nothing more.

237
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:29,280
Microsegmentation is a key zero
trust strategy to contain threats.

238
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,750
How do we achieve it?

239
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,250
By one approach is through
software defined networking.

240
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,320
Software defined networking.

241
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:42,060
SDN allows us to define
security policies centrally.

242
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:46,665
Independently of the underlying
physical network infrastructure.

243
00:16:47,085 --> 00:16:53,655
This makes it easier to enforce consistent
controls across diverse environments,

244
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:58,425
whether it's in your data center
or across multiple cloud platforms.

245
00:16:59,055 --> 00:17:02,895
Another powerful technique is
application layer segmentation.

246
00:17:03,405 --> 00:17:07,485
Instead of restricting communications
based on network addresses like

247
00:17:07,515 --> 00:17:11,685
IP addresses and ports, which can
be complex to manage in dynamic

248
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:16,365
environments, we restrict communication
based on the identity of the

249
00:17:16,365 --> 00:17:18,465
software or application itself.

250
00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:22,725
This provides a more robust
level of protection that remains

251
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:25,920
consistent, even if the underlying
network infrastructure changes.

252
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:32,370
Workload isolation takes this even
further establishing security boundaries

253
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:37,290
at a very granular level, such as
individual containers or processes.

254
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,880
This means that if one workload is
compromised, the potential damage is

255
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,110
confined to that specific workload,
minimizing the blast radius.

256
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:49,765
Crucially, implementing
effective microsegmentation

257
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:51,985
requires dependency mapping.

258
00:17:52,255 --> 00:17:56,425
You need a comprehensive understanding
of how your applications and

259
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:58,435
services communicate with each other.

260
00:17:58,765 --> 00:18:00,265
What are the dependencies?

261
00:18:00,505 --> 00:18:03,805
What communication flows are
legitimate, and mapping these

262
00:18:03,805 --> 00:18:08,395
dependencies is essential for defining
the correct segmentation policies.

263
00:18:10,635 --> 00:18:13,305
Remember, zero trust is continuous.

264
00:18:13,335 --> 00:18:14,805
It's not a one-time check.

265
00:18:15,165 --> 00:18:19,965
This is where continuous monitoring
and adaptive authentication comes in.

266
00:18:20,295 --> 00:18:22,784
It starts with baseline establishment.

267
00:18:23,325 --> 00:18:26,445
You need to understand what normal
behavior looks like for your

268
00:18:26,445 --> 00:18:29,025
users, devices and applications.

269
00:18:29,295 --> 00:18:31,335
What are the typical access patterns?

270
00:18:31,514 --> 00:18:33,135
What are the usual data flows?

271
00:18:33,315 --> 00:18:37,755
Establishing these baselines is
key to identifying deviations.

272
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,270
Then comes real-time monitoring.

273
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,530
You need to continuously collect
and analyze telemetry data from

274
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:49,450
every layer, endpoints, networks,
applications, identity systems.

275
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,680
This real-time stream of
information is vital for spotting

276
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,990
suspicious activity as it happens.

277
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:01,640
Based on that monitoring, you
perform risk assessment during a risk

278
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,040
assessment or an access request, right?

279
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:09,140
You evaluate multiple signals,
the user's behavior, the device's

280
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:13,370
health, the location, the time,
the sensitivity of the resources.

281
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,030
You assign a risk score to that specific
access attempt, and this leads to adaptive

282
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,910
response based on the detected risk level.

283
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:26,380
Your system can then dynamically
adjust the authentication requirements.

284
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:30,670
If an access attempt is at low
risk, perhaps standard MFA or

285
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,170
multifactor authentication is.

286
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,670
Successes are sufficient.

287
00:19:34,165 --> 00:19:38,335
If it's at high risk, say a user is
trying to access sensitive data from a

288
00:19:38,335 --> 00:19:43,855
new location at an unusual R, the system
might require additional authentication

289
00:19:43,855 --> 00:19:49,285
steps or even block access all
together and alert the security teams.

290
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:54,415
This dynamic response makes your
security posture much more resilient.

291
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:01,980
While Zero Trust encompasses users,
devices, and applications, the ultimate

292
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,990
goal is often protecting the data.

293
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,010
So a data-centric approach is vital
within the Zero trust framework.

294
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,230
It begins with data discovery.

295
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,870
You can't protect what
you don't know you have.

296
00:20:13,215 --> 00:20:18,015
You need to identify regulated and
sensitive information across all the

297
00:20:18,015 --> 00:20:22,905
storage repositories, databases, file
shares, cloud storage, et cetera.

298
00:20:23,295 --> 00:20:25,725
Once discovered, you need classification.

299
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:30,255
Categorize your data based on its
sensitivity and any regulatory

300
00:20:30,255 --> 00:20:34,545
requirements like g. D. Hipaa, et cetera.

301
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:38,235
This classification informs
the level of protection needed.

302
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,005
Then comes protection.

303
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:43,605
Apply appropriate controls
based on classification.

304
00:20:43,935 --> 00:20:47,145
This includes encryption of
data at rest and in transit.

305
00:20:47,355 --> 00:20:52,785
Robust access controls and data
loss prevention, DLP technologies

306
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:57,555
to prevent sensitive data from
leaving where the data is stored.

307
00:20:58,785 --> 00:21:00,315
And finally, governance.

308
00:21:00,675 --> 00:21:05,085
You need to monitor and control
information usage regardless of where that

309
00:21:05,085 --> 00:21:07,125
data is stored or being accessed from.

310
00:21:07,575 --> 00:21:12,975
This ensures compliance with policies
and regulations and helps prevent

311
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,315
unauthorized access or misuse.

312
00:21:17,655 --> 00:21:21,855
Implementing zero Trust is a
journey, not a destination, and

313
00:21:21,855 --> 00:21:23,775
it requires a strategic approach.

314
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:25,605
Start with an assessment.

315
00:21:25,845 --> 00:21:28,455
Understand your current
environment thoroughly.

316
00:21:28,845 --> 00:21:33,315
Document your existing architectures,
identify your most critical

317
00:21:33,315 --> 00:21:37,875
assets and data flows, and review
your existing security controls.

318
00:21:38,115 --> 00:21:39,765
This gives you a baseline.

319
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,180
Next is planning.

320
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,330
Define your target zero
trust architectures.

321
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,650
What will it look like?

322
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:50,880
Establish a conceptual framework that
aligns your zero trust implementation

323
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,980
with your organization's specific security
requirements and business objectives.

324
00:21:56,745 --> 00:21:58,425
Prioritize based on risk.

325
00:21:58,845 --> 00:22:01,155
Consider a phased implementation.

326
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:05,625
Trying to implement zero trust
everywhere at once can be overwhelming.

327
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:11,115
It's often best to begin with high
value or high risk environments, perhaps

328
00:22:11,115 --> 00:22:16,095
applications handling sensitive data
or user groups with elevated privileges

329
00:22:16,425 --> 00:22:21,075
gradually expand the implementation
to broader categories of resources.

330
00:22:21,075 --> 00:22:24,045
As your capabilities mature
and you gain experience.

331
00:22:24,585 --> 00:22:27,885
Finally focus on integration.

332
00:22:28,215 --> 00:22:31,425
You likely have existing
security infrastructure.

333
00:22:31,635 --> 00:22:34,605
The goal isn't necessary to
rip and replace everything.

334
00:22:35,025 --> 00:22:38,895
Adapt your existing infrastructure
where possible through technologies like

335
00:22:38,895 --> 00:22:43,215
security gateways, proxy architectures,
and enhancing your monitoring

336
00:22:43,215 --> 00:22:45,945
capabilities to fit the zero trust model.

337
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:52,830
The field of cybersecurity is constantly
evolving and the new technologies are

338
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,110
enhancing zero trust capabilities.

339
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:00,660
A IML is playing a significant role,
particularly in behavioral analytics.

340
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,580
Machine learning algorithms can analyze
vast amounts of historical access

341
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:10,890
patterns and contextual data to build
dynamic risk scores for users and

342
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,710
entities, improving anomaly detection.

343
00:23:14,115 --> 00:23:17,865
Cloud Native Security is
embedding zero trust principles

344
00:23:18,075 --> 00:23:20,055
directly into cloud platforms.

345
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:24,615
Service providers are offering
integrated identity federation,

346
00:23:24,885 --> 00:23:30,555
granular microsegmentation controls,
and API security mechanisms that align

347
00:23:30,615 --> 00:23:32,895
perfectly with zero trust architectures.

348
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:37,905
DevSecOps practices are helping
to embed security earlier in the

349
00:23:37,905 --> 00:23:42,075
application lifecycle rather than
trying to retrofit controls later.

350
00:23:42,495 --> 00:23:47,865
By building security into development
processes, we can ensure that

351
00:23:47,865 --> 00:23:54,465
applications are designed with zero
trust principles in mind from the start.

352
00:23:54,795 --> 00:23:58,665
And finally, the development of
standards and maturity models.

353
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,900
Is helping organizations understand
what a mature zero trust implementation

354
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,800
looks like and providing frameworks
for measuring their progress

355
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:10,380
across various security domains.

356
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:17,100
Finally, so looking ahead,
what's the future of zero Trust?

357
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:20,715
It's clear that zero trust
architecture has emerged as a

358
00:24:20,715 --> 00:24:22,575
transformative security model.

359
00:24:22,905 --> 00:24:27,615
It fundamentally changes how we protect
our valuable assets by addressing

360
00:24:27,615 --> 00:24:31,995
the inherent vulnerabilities of
traditional parameter based approaches.

361
00:24:32,235 --> 00:24:36,885
By implementing those continuous
verification processes across all digital

362
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:41,880
interactions, organizations are building
far more resilient security frameworks.

363
00:24:42,505 --> 00:24:47,335
These frameworks are capable of protecting
distributed resources effectively in

364
00:24:47,335 --> 00:24:49,645
today's complex computing environments.

365
00:24:50,215 --> 00:24:54,625
As implementation frameworks mature
and the integration with technologies

366
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:59,820
like artificial intelligence, cloud
security, and DevSecOps deepens zero trust

367
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,460
capabilities will continue to evolve.

368
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:08,215
This evolution will be crucial
to studying and staying ahead of

369
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,315
emerging threats and meeting the.

370
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:13,875
Ever changing operational
requirements of modern businesses?

371
00:25:14,475 --> 00:25:19,485
As I mentioned earlier, zero Trust isn't
a destination you reach and then stop.

372
00:25:19,755 --> 00:25:24,495
It's an ongoing strategy of philosophy
that will continue to adapt to the

373
00:25:24,495 --> 00:25:27,465
dynamic nature of technology and threats.

374
00:25:27,915 --> 00:25:30,915
It is the future of enterprise security.

375
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,790
Thank you again everyone for
your time and attention today.

376
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,690
I'm happy to take any
questions that you may have.

377
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,250
Feel free to let me know.

378
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,250
Thank you again and have
a great rest of your day.

379
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:45,660
Bye-bye.
