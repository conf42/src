1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,130
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,040
Welcome to corner 42 SRE 2025.

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,600
I am a pian a technology infras
specialist, and I will be talking

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,390
about how adopting effective site
reliability engineering practices can

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:18,420
significantly reduce operational it
streamline infrastructure deployments and

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,290
enhance our overall system performance
in multi-cloud infrastructures.

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,510
In agenda I'll be focusing on the overview
of multi-cloud infrastructures and their

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,880
complexities, and then role of SRE in
multi-cloud and how we can leverage SRE

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:39,320
best practices to to reduce or operation
over it and observability, automation

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,350
and tools and security and much more.

11
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:47,100
So multi-cloud infrastructures involve
leveraging multiple cloud providers.

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,080
Simultaneously to achieve optimal
flexibility, resilience, and performance.

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,490
So organizations are rapidly adopting
multi-cloud infrastructures to

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,610
capitalize on their distinct advantages.

15
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,569
But this also introduces
operational complexities that

16
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:07,869
blocks effective monitoring
security enforcement and performance

17
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:09,849
optimization across environments.

18
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:14,229
F first complexity like operational
and architectural complexity.

19
00:01:14,589 --> 00:01:17,709
So whenever you adopt multiple
clouds,  you are dealing

20
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:22,089
with different architectures,
APIs, and service offerings.

21
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:26,559
So which significantly increases
complexity in management and operations.

22
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:29,959
And second one,  visibility
and observability caps.

23
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,879
So maintaining a clear visibility
and a consistent observability across

24
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,299
various cloud environments often
becomes difficult due to different

25
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:41,099
monitoring tools and standards.

26
00:01:42,029 --> 00:01:44,969
And the third one,  data
silos or fragmentation.

27
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,809
So using separate monitoring and
logging solutions for each cloud

28
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:54,940
results in fragmented data that
limits the ability to have a unified,

29
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,309
comprehensive view of the entire system.

30
00:01:57,809 --> 00:02:02,360
And Atla the scalability and cost
management so efficiently managing

31
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,830
the scalability of data ingestion
and the retention across clouds,

32
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,220
while ensuring you remain within
the budgets can present substantial

33
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,020
financial and operational challenges.

34
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,456
Next, we can focus on the
role of SR in multicloud.

35
00:02:16,956 --> 00:02:21,936
So E core SRE principles so in
multi-cloud, we rely on clear measures

36
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:27,826
like SLI service level indicators to track
the performance SLOs, like service level

37
00:02:27,826 --> 00:02:34,026
objectives to set reliability targets and
error budgets to manage risk proactively

38
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:35,856
across distributed environments.

39
00:02:36,526 --> 00:02:38,706
Why SRE is critical in multi-cloud.

40
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,736
Like for coordination and standardization.

41
00:02:41,736 --> 00:02:47,326
SRE provides a unified approach ensuring
consistent processes, tools, and practices

42
00:02:47,326 --> 00:02:53,166
human across diverse cloud providers
and for reducing operation over it.

43
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:53,456
No.

44
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:58,386
We, if we implement consistent automation
leveraging self feeling infrastructures

45
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:03,426
and centralized observability, SRE
helps reduce manual intervention and

46
00:03:03,426 --> 00:03:04,776
those streamlines the operations.

47
00:03:05,511 --> 00:03:08,341
Also for performance and
reliability management.

48
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:13,151
If we establish clear performance
baselines and reliability thresholds

49
00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:18,081
it help effectively manage the
complexities and dependencies between

50
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:19,541
different cloud service products

51
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,381
and that last like
collaboration and organization.

52
00:03:22,621 --> 00:03:27,371
So for cross-functional teams, like if
you follow the effective multi-cloud

53
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:32,411
SRE, that involves like collaboration
among teams from operations, development,

54
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:36,681
security, and cloud providers
that helps, share fosters shared

55
00:03:36,681 --> 00:03:38,991
responsibility and efficient workflows.

56
00:03:39,591 --> 00:03:44,601
And also if we clearly align the SRE
objectives with organizational priorities

57
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:48,681
that ensures the reliability and
performance initiatives directly support,

58
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,741
broader business strategies and outcomes.

59
00:03:51,241 --> 00:03:54,171
So next is architecting for
reliability in multi-cloud.

60
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:58,761
The first, like we need to focus
on designing resilient services.

61
00:03:59,016 --> 00:04:02,416
So when architecting resilience
services, it's critical to

62
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,096
choose architectures wisely.

63
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:09,165
Adopting microservices or model
designs help because each component

64
00:04:09,225 --> 00:04:11,745
can scale and update independently.

65
00:04:12,505 --> 00:04:15,690
And also it helps us to reduce
the downtime and enhance the

66
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,915
reliability of the systems.

67
00:04:17,245 --> 00:04:21,025
So additionally implementing active
or active passive strategies across

68
00:04:21,025 --> 00:04:26,365
clouds that ensure high availability
and provides seamless failover in

69
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:28,605
the event of disruptions or outages.

70
00:04:29,105 --> 00:04:33,645
Also planning for failure and cross
cloud dependencies so we can proactively

71
00:04:33,645 --> 00:04:38,435
simulate potential failure scenarios,
ensuring that fallback mechanisms are

72
00:04:38,435 --> 00:04:40,475
not only effective, but tested regularly.

73
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,300
We can also focus heavily on maintaining
the data consistency and efficient

74
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,750
replication and synchronization
across multiple cloud environments.

75
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,640
And at last like network and data
management, so reliable network

76
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,235
and data management form a backbone
of resilient multi-cloud setup.

77
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:03,685
So we we can employ secure and high
performance data transfer designed

78
00:05:03,685 --> 00:05:05,695
explicitly for multi-cloud environments.

79
00:05:06,295 --> 00:05:10,536
So it is vital to manage data carefully
because achieving consistency across

80
00:05:10,536 --> 00:05:16,566
clouds without excessive replication over
it and that helps balance the performance,

81
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,036
reliability, and cost efficiency.

82
00:05:18,536 --> 00:05:23,751
So next we can see how we can
leverage SRE practices for re

83
00:05:23,871 --> 00:05:25,491
reducing the opportunity over it.

84
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:27,801
First is the automation and self feeling.

85
00:05:28,231 --> 00:05:31,861
By adopting IAC, the infrastructure
as code practices and human driven

86
00:05:31,861 --> 00:05:37,241
automation may the organizations or teams
can minimize the manual interventions

87
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:39,011
and mitigate configuration drift.

88
00:05:39,891 --> 00:05:42,471
Second is the standardized CICD pipelines.

89
00:05:42,651 --> 00:05:46,691
So implementing consistent CICD
pipelines across multiple cloud

90
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:52,121
providers that support uniformity and
reliability and software delivery.

91
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:56,891
So this standardization simplifies
the deployment processes, s

92
00:05:56,921 --> 00:06:01,431
errors, and accelerate the time
to market for critical updates.

93
00:06:01,931 --> 00:06:04,601
And the other one is the
observability and monitoring.

94
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:09,931
Deploying the advanced observability
frameworks can no provide or

95
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:13,351
support comprehensive logging
metrics, collection and tracing.

96
00:06:13,876 --> 00:06:17,815
To provide a deep visibility into
the system health and performance.

97
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:23,935
So this empowers various teams to
proactively identify agonize and

98
00:06:23,945 --> 00:06:29,626
address issues rapidly that helps
improve overall operational resilience.

99
00:06:30,126 --> 00:06:33,155
And at last, the capacity planning
and performance optimization.

100
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,550
Leveraging realtime performance
metrics and predictive analytics

101
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,450
enables proactive resource management
and efficient auto scaling.

102
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:45,100
So this approach ensures optimal resource
utilization and minimizes the cost over

103
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,450
next, how sari can improve
the performance reliability.

104
00:06:48,811 --> 00:06:52,710
For performance optimization, we
need to clearly identify and target

105
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:57,711
the most critical performance areas
that reduce latency and improving

106
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:00,741
the throughput with residency and
geographical dispersed setups.

107
00:07:01,241 --> 00:07:03,581
And the next is the
proactive capacity planning.

108
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:08,621
We can leverage predictive analytics
and forecasting to efficiency manager

109
00:07:08,621 --> 00:07:12,711
resources that prevents both research
shortage and over provisioning.

110
00:07:13,211 --> 00:07:15,271
And next the engineering.

111
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:19,981
So if we integrate some fault
injection tests across multi-cloud

112
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:24,491
environments that helps us to detect
weaknesses and also we can confidently

113
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:27,161
validate for any failover strategies.

114
00:07:27,661 --> 00:07:29,536
And at last resource allocation.

115
00:07:29,876 --> 00:07:32,966
If we strategically distribute
workloads to balance the cost,

116
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:34,101
efficiency and performance.

117
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:37,971
We can, and also leverage the
ephemeral and serverless computing

118
00:07:38,211 --> 00:07:43,051
to minimize the hover it without
sacrificing the reliability of systems.

119
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:47,591
Next, we talk about one of
the most crucial component

120
00:07:47,891 --> 00:07:51,531
of sorry, like observability
monitoring and instant response.

121
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:54,401
First is the unified monitoring.

122
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:59,481
So we leverage unified monitoring
techniques to seamlessly aggregate

123
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:03,141
metrics, logs, and traces
from diverse cloud vendors.

124
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:06,801
So delivering it helps us to deliver
comprehensive visibility through your

125
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:09,696
through single path or pan of class.

126
00:08:10,196 --> 00:08:12,056
And the next is a distributor tracing.

127
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:16,556
So distributed tracing ensures,  end
to end visibility by tracking requests

128
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:22,206
across microservices or environments
that span different cloud service

129
00:08:22,206 --> 00:08:25,886
products provide that helps provide
deep insights into performance,

130
00:08:25,886 --> 00:08:27,416
bottlenecks, and service interactions.

131
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,736
And the other one is the
electing and incident management.

132
00:08:31,156 --> 00:08:36,166
So if you configure the alert thresholds
and unified incident workflows, that

133
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:40,546
helps us to reduce the alert noise and
minimize the operational description.

134
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:45,316
And also it enables the faster
resolution times and improve

135
00:08:45,376 --> 00:08:46,936
overall service stability.

136
00:08:47,436 --> 00:08:51,526
And that lasts the tools and
platforms tools such as open

137
00:08:51,526 --> 00:08:53,721
telemetry Prometheus and Grafana.

138
00:08:54,096 --> 00:08:57,096
Support, multi-cloud visibility
and real time insights.

139
00:08:57,756 --> 00:09:03,956
So these powerful tools empower teams with
actionable data, accelerating response,

140
00:09:03,956 --> 00:09:07,471
and enhancing proactive management
across diverse cloud infrastructures.

141
00:09:07,971 --> 00:09:10,041
Next, the automation
and tooling strategies.

142
00:09:10,431 --> 00:09:12,381
First is the automated
C-I-T-C-D pipelines.

143
00:09:12,411 --> 00:09:16,501
If we establish automated continuous
integration and deployment pipelines

144
00:09:16,811 --> 00:09:20,381
that helps us like streamline
multi-cloud deployment releases.

145
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:24,131
Also, it minimizes the human
error and prevents configuration

146
00:09:24,161 --> 00:09:25,541
drift across platforms.

147
00:09:26,381 --> 00:09:29,771
And the other one is the the configuration
management and policy environment.

148
00:09:30,296 --> 00:09:31,016
Enforcement.

149
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:35,306
The tools such as like Ansible,
chef, puppet, and open policy

150
00:09:35,336 --> 00:09:39,706
agent that consistently enforce
security policies compliance and

151
00:09:39,706 --> 00:09:43,846
standardized to configurations
across the complex infrastructures.

152
00:09:44,346 --> 00:09:48,121
The next one is the self filling
mechanisms so we can design like

153
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:52,246
intelligence systems capable of
proactively detecting, mitigating

154
00:09:52,246 --> 00:09:56,386
and recovering from failures or
performance issues autonomously.

155
00:09:56,911 --> 00:10:00,301
So that helps us to reduce
any operational challenges.

156
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:03,861
And the last platform engineering
and developer enablement.

157
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:08,991
We can implement some intuitive
self-service portals or platform

158
00:10:09,081 --> 00:10:14,081
that interacts with the developers
to seamlessly build, deploy and scale

159
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:19,731
applications without any involvement
to work on any infras activities.

160
00:10:20,476 --> 00:10:23,776
They do not require to have
our infrastructure expertise.

161
00:10:24,276 --> 00:10:27,166
And the next is the security
and compliance in multi-cloud.

162
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:31,801
The first one, it's like your
unified security frameworks.

163
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:35,761
So if you implement a comprehensive
security scanning, automated

164
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:39,781
configuration checks and continuous
posture management, that helps us

165
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:44,861
to maintain a consistent security
baseline across diverse cloud providers.

166
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:48,801
And next, the IAM identity
access management.

167
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:52,101
So if you establish a
centralized IAM solution.

168
00:10:52,581 --> 00:10:58,501
That helps us to unify roles, permissions,
and enforce the least privileged

169
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:05,561
access models that can support,  IAM
policies across multiple cloud environs.

170
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:08,461
And the third one is the data
production and encryption.

171
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:12,576
And we can adopt some robust
encryption methods for data

172
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:14,471
first and in and in transit.

173
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:20,151
That leverages integrated key management
systems that operate eff effectively

174
00:11:20,151 --> 00:11:22,461
across different cloud provided platforms.

175
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:25,761
And at last, the zero trust architecture.

176
00:11:26,621 --> 00:11:32,001
So zero trust principles strategically,
can verify and secure every

177
00:11:32,001 --> 00:11:36,141
communication and transaction between
sources, applications, and users

178
00:11:36,141 --> 00:11:38,741
within complex multi-cloud landscapes.

179
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:42,571
And at last, to see future
trends and considerations.

180
00:11:43,071 --> 00:11:45,531
See here the evolution of
cloud native technologies like

181
00:11:45,531 --> 00:11:49,101
organizations will increasingly
leverage serverless architectures.

182
00:11:49,551 --> 00:11:53,901
Or like function as a service to simplify
the operations and optimize resource

183
00:11:53,901 --> 00:11:56,641
usage across various cloud platforms.

184
00:11:56,881 --> 00:12:01,871
Nowadays  AI driven practices or
like strategies known as  AI ops

185
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:08,231
or becoming, I know essential for
managing the scale and complexity of

186
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:09,881
large scale multi-cloud environment.

187
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:12,621
Next is the advanced SRES approaches.

188
00:12:12,781 --> 00:12:18,441
SRE practices will evolve through
advanced reliability modeling advanced

189
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:23,271
observability frameworks, proactive
chaos engineering and continuous

190
00:12:23,271 --> 00:12:29,391
resilience testing to ensure systems are
robust in multi-cloud infrastructures.

191
00:12:30,261 --> 00:12:34,041
And at last year, the shifts in
industry standards and compliance.

192
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:38,681
So we can anticipate more rigorous
and expansive data governance

193
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:43,481
regulations associating like
proactive adaptation and compliance

194
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:45,971
across global cloud infrastructures.

195
00:12:46,471 --> 00:12:46,861
Thank you.
