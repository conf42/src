00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,650
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,650
I am Guru Ti I go by Guru.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,680
Completed my masters in engineering from
Clemson University, and the last 16 years

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,750
I've been working in healthcare industry.

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,500
Today, I'm excited to share
how Kubernetes and cloud native

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,730
technology are reshaping one of the
most traditional, often frustrating

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,620
industries out there, which is insurance.

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,159
We will explore how real time
underwriting and enrollment can

9
00:00:24,159 --> 00:00:25,869
be achieved at Kubernetes scale.

10
00:00:26,229 --> 00:00:30,759
Why this matters for insurers and
customers, and I will share some real case

11
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:32,920
studies that prove it is just not theory.

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,880
It is happening Now, let's
start with the challenge.

13
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,560
Insurance has always been slow moving,
paper heavy and resistant to change.

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,540
Think about the traditional process.

15
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,805
You fill out long forms,
gather documents, submit them.

16
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,500
And then you wait for the edition.

17
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,380
The edition comes in
days or sometimes week.

18
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,420
That was acceptable 10 years ago.

19
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,500
But in today's digital world,
customer expect immediacy.

20
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,810
If FinTech apps can approve a loan in
second and in seconds, and Amazon can

21
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:06,580
deliver on the same day, why should buying
insurance feel like waiting forever?

22
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,740
This gap has opened the
door for insurtech startups.

23
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,320
They're cloud native.

24
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,000
From day one, they can deliver instant
personalized message and they're

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,039
eroding the market share of incumbents.

26
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,690
So here is the reality.

27
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:24,549
Unless insurers modernize with cloud
native architectures, their risk

28
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:28,889
irrelevance in a rapidly evolving market,
let me break down the pain points in

29
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:33,269
traditional insurance underwriting
cycle often take five to 15 days.

30
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:35,639
That is an eternity in
today's digital world.

31
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,749
Up to 30% of applications are
delayed or rejected because

32
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:41,130
they are missing information.

33
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,299
Human underwriters are overloaded
with repetitive tasks which

34
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,839
prevents them from focusing on
the complex and high value cases.

35
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:52,649
Customers abandon application
out of frustration and directly

36
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:53,609
hurting conversion rate.

37
00:01:54,374 --> 00:02:00,255
And compliance processes are still largely
manual, reactive and painfully slow, taken

38
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:05,984
together these inefficiencies screen for
automation, integration, and scalability.

39
00:02:06,195 --> 00:02:08,595
And that is exactly where
Cloud Native comes in.

40
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:14,165
So why Cloud native, unless unlike
the old and monolithic system,

41
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:18,395
insurers have relied on cloud native
architectures, break applications

42
00:02:18,395 --> 00:02:21,395
into microservices, connected by APIs.

43
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:23,315
There are three big benefits.

44
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,145
First one is adaptability.

45
00:02:25,565 --> 00:02:30,140
If regulation changes or pneumatic, or
there's a new mandate or a new product

46
00:02:30,305 --> 00:02:34,925
is needed, insurers can adapt quickly
without rewriting an entire system.

47
00:02:35,315 --> 00:02:36,635
Second one is scalability.

48
00:02:36,965 --> 00:02:41,105
Infrastructure automatically expands
our contracts depending on demand.

49
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:45,425
That is vital during peak enrollment
season when traffic surges

50
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,985
and third built in compliance
auditing are part of the system.

51
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:54,245
So insurers no longer have to
choose between speed and regulation.

52
00:02:54,745 --> 00:02:56,995
At heart of this shift is Kubernetes.

53
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:01,285
It has become the defacto standard
for container orchestration, and it

54
00:03:01,285 --> 00:03:03,175
provides exactly what insurance needs.

55
00:03:03,745 --> 00:03:08,845
Think about it, AI models, APIs,
underwriting workflows, they can all

56
00:03:08,845 --> 00:03:12,985
be deployed in containers that run
anywhere, whether on-prem or in the cloud.

57
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:18,170
During open enrollment, if 10,000
users log in at once, Kubernetes,

58
00:03:18,175 --> 00:03:20,895
autoscales instantly to meet the demand.

59
00:03:20,955 --> 00:03:23,085
No downtime, no bottlenecks.

60
00:03:23,715 --> 00:03:29,055
If a component fails, Kubernetes
restarts, its restarted automatically.

61
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:33,345
That means mission critical systems
stay available and for compliance.

62
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,275
Kubernetes integrates into
pipeline that are fully auditable.

63
00:03:37,365 --> 00:03:41,265
Every deployment is tracked and
logged and re regulators allow that.

64
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,989
Now let's talk about underwriting process.

65
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,700
Historically, underwriting many
days of manual checks, piles

66
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,529
of paperwork, and long delays.

67
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:55,670
But with cloud native architecture,
we can compress that cycle

68
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,559
time into less than 60 seconds.

69
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,249
This isn't just about speed,
it is about personalization.

70
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:04,999
By pulling in real time data
feeds, insurers can generate

71
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:06,710
offers that reflect an applicant's.

72
00:04:07,355 --> 00:04:11,225
Actual risk profile in that
moment that improves both accuracy

73
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,634
and a customer satisfaction.

74
00:04:13,264 --> 00:04:17,674
Underwriting goes from being a bottleneck
to being a competitive advantage.

75
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,385
So the engine behind this is the
AI driven underwriting pipeline.

76
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:25,885
These pipelines pull in data from
everywhere, credit score, medical

77
00:04:25,885 --> 00:04:32,125
scores, medical history, pharmacy data,
lifestyle attributes, and even iot

78
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,130
sources like wearable health devices.

79
00:04:34,015 --> 00:04:38,005
All of that flows into Kubernetes
cluster, where machine learning model

80
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:40,135
instantly analyze and score risk.

81
00:04:40,435 --> 00:04:41,725
The results are dramatic.

82
00:04:42,145 --> 00:04:45,955
The underwriting time is
cut down by 95% or more.

83
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:50,185
Accuracy improves because a model,
continuously learned, and monetary

84
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:54,415
monitoring systems check for bias,
compliance breaches, and data

85
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:58,075
drift, ensuring distance remain
ethical and regulator friendly.

86
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,600
So AI plus Kubernetes equals underwriting.

87
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,090
That is fast, fair, and scalable, but
underwriting is just half the story.

88
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,600
Enrollment is where customer
actually complete their journey.

89
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,290
Or dropout.

90
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,860
Kubernetes power enrollment
platform eliminate friction points.

91
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:18,030
Automated I ID verification,
ties into government databases

92
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:18,955
or other data sources.

93
00:05:19,595 --> 00:05:22,340
E-signatures are embedded
directly into the workflow.

94
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,060
Data validation APIs ensure everything
is correct before submission.

95
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:31,925
The result is up to 70% fewer errors,
less manual overhead, smoother

96
00:05:31,955 --> 00:05:34,265
onboarding, and higher conversion rates.

97
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,895
Customer trusts the process
because it feels seamless.

98
00:05:38,395 --> 00:05:40,915
Now imagine the entire
process as a digital journey.

99
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:44,095
A customer enters their
details into a portal.

100
00:05:44,425 --> 00:05:46,315
APIs validate the data.

101
00:05:46,735 --> 00:05:50,665
A risk station is returned within
seconds with approved, deny, or review.

102
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,100
Enrollment system handle id,
verification and signatures

103
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,960
automatically, and the policy is issued
instantly with complaints logging,

104
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,520
running quietly in the background.

105
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:05,350
That is insurance reimagine,
end-to-end, efficient, transparent,

106
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,790
and fast and compliant.

107
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:10,380
Let's bring this into live
with two case studies.

108
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,745
First, insurer A, their
underwriting process used to take.

109
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,370
Five days after migrating to
Kubernetes native pipeline,

110
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,830
they cut it down to 45 seconds.

111
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:26,360
For 85% of applications,
completion rates jumped 40%.

112
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,860
Customer satisfaction rose by
35%, and millions were saved

113
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,510
in operating operating cost.

114
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,105
Now moving on to the second use case.

115
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,160
As the Ensure B, their
bottleneck was enrollment.

116
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,300
Brokers complained about delays
and rework by implementing

117
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,100
Kubernetes powered workflows.

118
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,620
Manual overhead dropped 60%.

119
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,050
Complaints are audits became smoother.

120
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,800
Broker relationship improved
and scale sales conversion.

121
00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:56,025
Sales conversion rose significantly.

122
00:06:56,635 --> 00:06:59,770
These are real world transformation
that show both return on

123
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,910
investment and strategic impact.

124
00:07:01,465 --> 00:07:02,715
Okay, moving on.

125
00:07:03,285 --> 00:07:06,225
Integration is the glue that
makes realtime insurance possible.

126
00:07:06,465 --> 00:07:10,905
API Gateway securely connect internal
engines with external data sources.

127
00:07:11,295 --> 00:07:14,745
Even driven architectures like
Kafka enable instant updates.

128
00:07:14,895 --> 00:07:19,005
For example, if a medical score
changes mid application, the

129
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,505
system adapts immediately.

130
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,160
Hybrid cloud setup allows sensitive
datas to stay on-prem while leveraging

131
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,780
the scalability of public cloud.

132
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,070
And zero trust.

133
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,880
Security ensure every interaction
is authenticated and authorized.

134
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,860
Together these patents create a
resilient, compliant digital ecosystem.

135
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,380
Now, automation doesn't means.

136
00:07:41,785 --> 00:07:43,255
Humor are out of this picture.

137
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:46,255
It means they're focused
where they matter most.

138
00:07:46,615 --> 00:07:51,685
With exception based review, 85% of
applications are handled automatically.

139
00:07:52,225 --> 00:07:57,415
The remaining 50%, the Edge case, the high
risk profiles of Flag for Expert Human

140
00:07:57,415 --> 00:08:04,435
Review, this hybrid approach saves time,
reduces workload, and reissues regulators.

141
00:08:04,435 --> 00:08:06,535
That human oversight is still there.

142
00:08:07,035 --> 00:08:09,015
And of course, resilience is critical.

143
00:08:09,105 --> 00:08:11,325
Insurance is a high stakes business.

144
00:08:11,415 --> 00:08:13,935
Imagine systems crashing
during open enrollment.

145
00:08:14,475 --> 00:08:15,135
That'll be com.

146
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,665
That'll be a complete catastrophic.

147
00:08:17,265 --> 00:08:20,715
Kubernetes delivers resilience
through auto-scaling for traffic

148
00:08:20,715 --> 00:08:25,755
surges, multi-region deployments to
withstand outages, observability with

149
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,975
tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

150
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:30,555
Automated failover for
instant disaster recovery.

151
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:35,295
These capabilities don't just keep
the lights on, they build trust

152
00:08:35,295 --> 00:08:36,885
with customers and regulators.

153
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:39,125
So what does this all translate into?

154
00:08:39,425 --> 00:08:41,465
These all translate into measurable.

155
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,100
Transformative results.

156
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,020
Underwriting reduced from weeks to
under 60 seconds, not in good order.

157
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,090
Error rates down by 70%.

158
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,490
Data quality up by 60%.

159
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,360
Conversion rates increased by 30 to 45%.

160
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,470
Operational cost cut
down as much as by 55%.

161
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,220
Cloud native isn't just a
technology upgrade, it is a

162
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,090
strategic lever for revenue,
growth, retention, and efficiency.

163
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,440
Let's wrap up.

164
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,770
The insurance industry
is at a turning point.

165
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,280
Cloud native technologies powered
by Kubernetes are enabling

166
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,240
insurers to reinvent underwriting,
enrollment, and compliance.

167
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:24,700
The future is now real-time systems that
respond instantly secure and compliant

168
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,920
platform that scale with confidence.

169
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:31,255
Intelligent workflows that turn
disruption into advantage for

170
00:09:31,255 --> 00:09:35,635
insurance, for architects, for
engineers, the mandate is clear.

171
00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:37,795
Cloud native is not optional.

172
00:09:37,855 --> 00:09:39,955
It is the future of insurance.
