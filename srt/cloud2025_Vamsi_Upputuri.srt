00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:00,870
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,450
My name is Vamsi Upadhyay and I work
as a senior statistical programmer

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,710
in the biotechnology field.

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,770
Today I'll talk about how artificial
intelligence and machine learning

5
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:14,040
are revolutionizing the statistical
programming by enhancing the efficiency,

6
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:18,990
ensuring regulatory compliance, and
unlocking the data driven insights that

7
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:23,490
can accelerate the drug development
and improving patient outcomes.

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,619
AI driven automation has transformed
the way clinical trials operate,

9
00:00:29,499 --> 00:00:33,179
optimizing workflows and reducing
clinical trial duration by 45%.

10
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:38,150
For example, instead of manually
inputting and verifying patient

11
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:43,440
data, AI systems now automate this
process in real time, minimizing

12
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:45,650
errors and accelerating approvals.

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,839
Patient recruitment is one of
the biggest challenges in any

14
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:50,970
clinical trials like this.

15
00:00:51,144 --> 00:00:54,835
Finding the rights of patients

00:01:05,264 --> 00:01:11,100
For instance, in a cardiovascular
trial, AI is used to analyze electronic

19
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,770
health records and genetic data to
quickly identify eligible candidates

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,600
