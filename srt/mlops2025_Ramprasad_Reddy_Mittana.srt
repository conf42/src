1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,040
Good morning, afternoon, evening,
everyone, and welcome to my session,

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,809
ML Ops at Scale Production Ready
AI Systems for HR Transformation

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,050
here at ML 42 ml OPS 2025.

4
00:00:12,739 --> 00:00:14,719
My name is Ram PRIs Miana.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,570
A little bit about my
background as we begin.

6
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:23,330
I have over 20 years of work experience
in the technology space working at top

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,285
companies such as NSF International,
Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, and.

8
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:28,669
Oracle.

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,420
I'm currently serving as an
Assistant director of HR Information

10
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,610
Systems at NSF International.

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,420
Throughout my career, I've been
instrumental in driving digital

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,520
transformation, AI and ML integration
and enterprise technology architecture.

13
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,000
My expertise spans HR technology
modernization cloud ERP

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,810
implementations and AI driven
automation across various industries.

15
00:00:53,485 --> 00:00:58,435
These experiences have given me a deep
understanding of how innovative solutions

16
00:00:58,435 --> 00:01:03,055
can enhance operational efficiency and
deliver tangible business outcomes.

17
00:01:03,555 --> 00:01:08,294
Today I'll be sharing a little technical
blueprint for deploying generative AI in

18
00:01:08,384 --> 00:01:14,055
HR Shade Services Center, focusing on not
just operational excellence, but trust,

19
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,035
compliance, and the ability to scale.

20
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,490
Let's dive in.

21
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,990
Here's what I'll be covering
in the next 30 minutes, right?

22
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:25,640
First, I'll introduce our ML ops
architecture and show you what it really

23
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,460
takes to run a reliable production
grade ML system supporting over 10

24
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,560
million HR transactions every month.

25
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,830
Then I'll cover how we approach
performance monitoring, including

26
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,110
drift reduction and custom HR metrics.

27
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:47,290
Keep in mind, this is critical for any
regulated hr, high volume HR operations.

28
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,660
Next, I'll walk you through our data
engineering strategies, including

29
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,250
building privacy, preserving,
and real-time feature pipelines.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,960
After that, I'll break down our
scalable deployment patterns,

31
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:08,410
highlighting how we serve our 50,000
employees efficiently and securely

32
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,320
across multiple business entities.

33
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,019
And finally, I'll focus on our
operational excellence and governance

34
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:21,600
framework as to how we build audit
trails, how we reduce bias, and how we

35
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,579
can ensure compliance at every step.

36
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:27,200
Let's talk a little bit about
the HR AI Production Challenge.

37
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,809
HR Shared Service centers present
a unique set of challenges for AI

38
00:02:31,809 --> 00:02:38,075
operations, and we must process sensitive
employee data that crosses national

39
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:42,924
and legal jurisdictions, workforce
size and needs fluctuate seasonally.

40
00:02:43,749 --> 00:02:48,699
Mass hirings performance review
cycles and benefit open enrollments

41
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:51,069
can spike query volumes dramatically.

42
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:56,529
Models must deliver reliable,
consistent results across a

43
00:02:56,529 --> 00:02:58,959
wide variety of HR query types.

44
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:03,540
On top of that, strict compliance
requirements in regulated

45
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,939
industries are negotiable.

46
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:05,499
Okay.

47
00:03:06,224 --> 00:03:09,855
All of this has to operate
at massive scape, right?

48
00:03:09,914 --> 00:03:13,124
Over 10 million monthly interactions.

49
00:03:14,054 --> 00:03:19,334
Standard MOPS approaches just aren't
enough for these high stakes and

50
00:03:19,334 --> 00:03:20,624
in an ever changing environment.

51
00:03:21,554 --> 00:03:27,759
So we need a customized architecture and
continuous automation just to stay ahead.

52
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:29,129
Let's go to the next slide.

53
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:34,339
In this slide we'll talk a little bit
about the production ML ops architecture.

54
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:40,549
Our production environment is based
on containerized model deployment

55
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:43,010
orchestrated with Kubernetes.

56
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,349
This architecture gives us a
flexibility to optimize resource

57
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:52,879
use and tap into GPU acceleration
where needed for both training.

58
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:59,130
And in France we use an automated AB
testing and cannery deployment framework.

59
00:04:00,029 --> 00:04:05,279
This allows us to roll out new
models safely and deploying to

60
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:09,149
a small segment of users first,
backed by statistical significance

61
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:14,090
testing, so we never compromise on
the employee experience scheduled.

62
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,380
Automated retraining pipelines
are at the core of our life cycle.

63
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,365
Keep in mind that these key part models
maintaining at least 92% accuracy

64
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:29,885
even as business requirements and data
distributions shift across a diverse range

65
00:04:29,885 --> 00:04:32,695
of HR query types, and the next slide.

66
00:04:33,414 --> 00:04:38,354
Next, let's talk about the ML
Ops pipeline workflow here.

67
00:04:38,854 --> 00:04:44,015
Let's look at our ML ops pipeline designed
to ensure not just speed and accuracy.

68
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:46,249
But also the robust compliance.

69
00:04:46,749 --> 00:04:51,609
We start with data ingestion,
streamlining the data from HR

70
00:04:51,609 --> 00:04:56,369
systems, chat bot logs, and ticketing
workflows, and data validation is next.

71
00:04:57,299 --> 00:05:01,259
Applying strict privacy and
schema checks right upfront.

72
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,009
We dedicate significant effort to
feature engineering, creating and

73
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:12,079
transforming model features that
truly reflect HR business logic.

74
00:05:13,024 --> 00:05:15,424
Like capturing tenure
or internal mobility.

75
00:05:15,924 --> 00:05:17,724
Next comes the model training.

76
00:05:18,294 --> 00:05:23,094
It's tightly tracked and experiment
managed for reproducibility.

77
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:27,584
Every model goes through a
rigorous evaluation and approval

78
00:05:27,584 --> 00:05:32,159
process, combining quantitative
metrics with stakeholder reviews.

79
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:33,469
It's a balance.

80
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:38,509
This end-to-end workflow ensures
we never sacrifice quality

81
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:40,519
or auditability for speed.

82
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:44,199
And the next slide, let's talk
a little bit about the model

83
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,429
performance and monitoring.

84
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:46,679
This is the key.

85
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:50,819
Monitoring sits at the heart for
problem ready production readiness.

86
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:56,719
We maintain real time dashboards
that give granular visibility into

87
00:05:56,809 --> 00:06:02,899
every HR metric that matters, like
chat bot response accuracy, average

88
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:09,469
resolution time, or single satisfaction
rates, or robust drift detection

89
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,959
infrastructure spots, the changes.

90
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:17,419
In input data or model output,
very quickly recognizing the

91
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:21,679
degradation, 73% faster than before.

92
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,879
We track custom HR relevant metrics
and use automated alerting to guarantee

93
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,184
a 19 9.5 SLA for the business.

94
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:37,154
Staying proactive means catching
potential issues before the

95
00:06:37,154 --> 00:06:38,504
impact of real employees.

96
00:06:39,074 --> 00:06:40,094
We're not reactive.

97
00:06:40,594 --> 00:06:46,264
So now let's talk about the
continuous feedback and improvement.

98
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:51,489
As we can see in the diagram, we operate
a continuous feedback and implement loop.

99
00:06:51,989 --> 00:06:56,159
All user interactions, every
question, every chatbot

100
00:06:56,159 --> 00:07:00,959
response and every satisfaction
rating are thoroughly tracked.

101
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:08,179
We analyze fail interactions and
patterns that flag friction or confusion.

102
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:13,534
These insights flow directly into
our supervised retraining cycles.

103
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:19,944
Ultimately resulting in 28%,
which is a big number boost

104
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:21,834
to overall model accuracy.

105
00:07:22,824 --> 00:07:27,474
The lesson here is that HR AI
systems should never be static.

106
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:32,334
They should evolve as the workforce
and the business needs change.

107
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:35,744
In the next slide, we're gonna
talk a little bit about the

108
00:07:35,744 --> 00:07:38,624
data engineering for HR ai.

109
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:43,594
HR data requires the highest
standards of privacy and data quality.

110
00:07:44,104 --> 00:07:45,544
We cannot compromise on that.

111
00:07:46,044 --> 00:07:51,144
We have fully automated pipelines
for PII, detection and tokenization.

112
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:56,689
These are built to comply with
global standards like GDPR and CCPA.

113
00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:03,009
Data quality is protected by strict
schema enforcement and anomaly detection.

114
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:10,559
With our systems achieving a 99.2%
data accuracy rate to keep things fast,

115
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:16,319
we use real-time feature engineering
with streaming architecture, cutting

116
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,779
model inference latency by 65%.

117
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:25,159
That means no compromise between
privacy, compliance and user experience.

118
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:28,404
Now this is the key.

119
00:08:28,734 --> 00:08:30,114
How do we implement it?

120
00:08:30,894 --> 00:08:33,144
What is in store for each feature?

121
00:08:33,644 --> 00:08:39,374
This is the key enabler, right in our
pipeline, which is our HR feature store.

122
00:08:39,874 --> 00:08:44,219
This provides consistent
features for both training.

123
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:51,819
And real time inference with point in time
correctness to prevent leakage, especially

124
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:53,919
important for time series HR data.

125
00:08:54,419 --> 00:09:00,649
It's supposed low latency, less than
10 milliseconds feature serving for

126
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:03,409
instant response in HR applications.

127
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:10,459
And everything is automatically versioned
and lineage tracked using Spark and Flink.

128
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,099
The result is twofold.

129
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:19,019
A 65% reduction in latency for
end users and a 40% savings on

130
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:20,729
computer infrastructure costs.

131
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:22,709
This is a great outcome.

132
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:25,459
Now, how can we scale this?

133
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:28,719
Let's talk about the
scalability plumbing strategies.

134
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:30,999
So how do we operate at scale?

135
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:37,359
Our multi-tenant, my, our, excuse
me, our multi-tenant architecture

136
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:42,729
isolates business units while sharing
secure reliable infrastructure,

137
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:48,124
which supporting over 50,000
employees with risk separation.

138
00:09:48,624 --> 00:09:54,054
For model updates, we use BLUEGREEN
deployment, ensuring zero downtime and

139
00:09:54,114 --> 00:10:00,314
instant rollback If something goes wrong,
our auto scaling infrastructure gracefully

140
00:10:00,314 --> 00:10:03,704
absorbs traffic spikes up to 10 times.

141
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:10,584
During busy seasons, cost optimization
is built in leveraging spot instances

142
00:10:10,584 --> 00:10:16,884
and dynamic right sizing to deliver a
40% cut in the infrastructure spend.

143
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:21,229
Let's understand the graph about
the seasonal scaling patterns.

144
00:10:21,729 --> 00:10:22,929
This is some real data.

145
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:27,579
You'll see big spikes in query
volumes and infrastructure costs

146
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,829
corresponding to typical HR cycles.

147
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:33,909
For example, onboarding in January,
performance reviews in December,

148
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:35,679
benefits enrollment in the fall.

149
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:41,699
Our auto scaling setup dynamically adapts
to these cycles, so resources are always

150
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:47,629
available when needed, but we aren't
over-provisioned and wasteful in quite

151
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:50,749
periods, so we're saving some money there.

152
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:55,449
If you only remember one thing
here, keep in mind that you should

153
00:10:55,479 --> 00:11:00,099
align your technology scaling with
your business and HR calendar.

154
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:03,989
This brings me to the operational
excellence in governance.

155
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:07,549
Operational excellence goes
hand in hand with governance.

156
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:16,234
We've implemented a comprehensive ML
ops governance framework tracking all AI

157
00:11:16,514 --> 00:11:22,649
decisions with end-to-end audit trails
that enable rapid compliance responses.

158
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:28,249
Automated bias detection is built
in, and our approach has reduced

159
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:35,389
discriminatory outcomes by 89% while
maintaining high model accuracy.

160
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:39,999
We offer multi jurisdiction compliance
monitoring and model explainability

161
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:45,119
tools tailored to HR so that the
decisions impacting people's careers

162
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:47,639
can always be interpreted and justified.

163
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:53,439
Now talk about, let's talk about the bias
detection and mitigation on the critical

164
00:11:53,439 --> 00:12:00,509
topic of fairness, which is our automated
frameworks for bias detection, mitigation,

165
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:02,834
and validation have been transmitted.

166
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:09,424
We check for bias, both in training data
and during ongoing model evaluation.

167
00:12:10,024 --> 00:12:13,679
Constantly monitoring and revalidating
for each retraining cycle.

168
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:18,859
Thanks to this, we've reduced
discriminatory outcomes by 89%

while maintaining model performance.

170
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:25,929
Keep in mind that biases bias
is not something you solve once.

It's a continual responsibility for
hedge, for every HR data practitioner.

All right, so we reached the end
of our presentation, so let's

173
00:12:37,404 --> 00:12:42,194
talk about the key takeaways and
we can have a q and a to close.

174
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:44,804
Let me summarize the key lessons.

175
00:12:45,304 --> 00:12:51,664
Always use containerized deployments
and automated retraining to manage

176
00:12:51,664 --> 00:12:53,824
diverse changing HR workloads.

177
00:12:54,754 --> 00:12:57,634

You're dealing with HR
data, so we have to vary.

Always architect for scalability.

185
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,909
Use multi-tenant blue, green deployment,
auto scaling, and cost efficiency.

186
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:29,129
It's all about the numbers and about all.

187

Make comprehensive governance and bias
reduction a pillar of your operation.

188
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:39,704

trust, fairness, and compliance.
