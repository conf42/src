1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,910
Machine learning and AI are so
often used in current industries.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,420
We use to generate code or
comments around the code or

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,380
writing up some email, et cetera.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,660
This has become normal after,
GPT came into the picture.

5
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:17,299
when we take the same.

6
00:00:17,624 --> 00:00:23,144
machine learning and apply it to anomaly
detection on the day to day issues like

7
00:00:23,164 --> 00:00:29,114
production outages or security issues
or on call issues with one single goal

8
00:00:29,174 --> 00:00:33,804
of diagnosing the problem before a
developer or support tries to debug.

9
00:00:34,354 --> 00:00:38,614
This concept leads to AI powered
RCA or Root Cause Analysis.

10
00:00:39,114 --> 00:00:43,724
If we look at traditional RCA, it
is a pain, as support or on call

11
00:00:43,724 --> 00:00:47,994
engineer trying to go through logs
and reaching out to stakeholders and

12
00:00:48,004 --> 00:00:51,574
trying to verify product behavior and
creating a detailed documentation.

13
00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:56,304
This is so stressful and
it's so manual effort.

14
00:00:56,814 --> 00:01:00,174
And whereas a lot of things can go
wrong in this manual process, right?

15
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:04,184
So in experience, in my experience,
my first few on call shifts were.

16
00:01:04,684 --> 00:01:08,804
Heavily dependent on senior engineers
and I barely learned anything over time.

17
00:01:08,804 --> 00:01:13,304
I was able to understand the product
better and able to debug and gain

18
00:01:13,314 --> 00:01:18,544
significant experience so that I
can predict what might be the root

19
00:01:18,544 --> 00:01:23,805
cause of an issue and start the
investigation in the root in that route.

20
00:01:24,404 --> 00:01:29,254
so providing the same learning curve to
machines and enhancing the concept of

21
00:01:29,994 --> 00:01:34,404
RCA, this will definitely help us detect.

22
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:38,889
hidden patterns and provide
data points on what went wrong.

23
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:44,009
This reduces analysis by at least
70 percent and it is accurate

24
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:47,809
while the system is learning
continuously from each investigation.

25
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:52,649
That sounds cool to me, so I
lean towards AI powered RCAs.

26
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:57,069
Moving to the core concepts
of AI powered RCAs.

27
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:01,499
There are machine learning algorithms
is one of the core concept which

28
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:06,269
processes millions of data points
and correlates to patterns.

29
00:02:06,589 --> 00:02:11,349
These are self improving systems
which learn from each analysis

30
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:13,689
in turn increases the accuracy.

31
00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:16,239
And the second one is anomaly detection.

32
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:20,749
Once we establish the baseline
pattern metrics, anomaly detection

33
00:02:20,749 --> 00:02:25,429
comes into the picture with
instantly flagging deviations.

34
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:30,214
with precision and the last block is
more of a natural language processing

35
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:37,264
is required to analyze unstructured data
like technical logs, feedback and support

36
00:02:37,264 --> 00:02:39,054
tickets to identify emerging issues.

37
00:02:39,554 --> 00:02:44,134
So in order to implement the AI powered
RCA's, there are some prerequisites.

38
00:02:44,474 --> 00:02:48,874
So data collection is not easy, as
scraping some web pages as such.

39
00:02:48,934 --> 00:02:52,424
So this is the fundamental
part of, the prerequisites.

40
00:02:52,649 --> 00:02:58,529
And here we need human power to
categorize things like logs, metrics,

41
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:02,569
historical incident reports, into
structured versus unstructured data.

42
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:04,979
This is core step.

43
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:11,219
I cannot emphasize enough on the step, and
its importance to achieve AI powered RCA.

44
00:03:11,899 --> 00:03:16,379
So AI or ML, the second one is
AI or ML model selection itself.

45
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:21,719
it's selecting and training process of a
pre trained model or custom built models.

46
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:26,974
with respect to the domain is dependent
on each, industry and company itself.

47
00:03:27,604 --> 00:03:31,464
Then comes the integration
with existing IT ecosystems.

48
00:03:32,104 --> 00:03:37,094
Another core step of collaboration with
teams for human in the loop validation.

49
00:03:37,814 --> 00:03:41,994
Then comes governance and security
measures where we should be

50
00:03:41,994 --> 00:03:46,889
operating under All privacy laws
and role based access controls.

51
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:53,319
The last one is managing an incident
and on each incident level, we

52
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:56,839
should manage feedback loop so that
continuous learning is supported.

53
00:03:57,339 --> 00:04:01,949
When it comes to implementation of an
AI powered RCA, the data collection

54
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:06,939
and pre processing, this part we
can dive a little bit deeper and try

55
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:10,514
to understand what are the things
which are technically involved here.

56
00:04:10,904 --> 00:04:14,534
data collection and pre processing,
consists of a human intervention

57
00:04:14,574 --> 00:04:19,874
into, aggregating the logs, metrics,
establishing the baselines of metrics,

58
00:04:20,144 --> 00:04:22,904
and collecting event data from
Kubernetes, let's say, and microservices.

59
00:04:23,404 --> 00:04:27,744
and cloud providers, implementing
the ETL pipelines itself and feature

60
00:04:27,824 --> 00:04:29,924
engineering so that there can be scoped.

61
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:31,744
each feature can be scoped.

62
00:04:31,844 --> 00:04:33,654
Each issue can be scoped kind of stuff.

63
00:04:34,104 --> 00:04:37,684
then moving to the next step, which
is AI or model development itself.

64
00:04:37,884 --> 00:04:42,794
So using models like random forest,
deep learning and NLP for log analysis

65
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:50,214
and applying cash casual inference
and SHAP for explainability in RCA.

66
00:04:50,714 --> 00:04:55,024
SHAP is nothing but Shapely
Additive Explanations is a

67
00:04:55,064 --> 00:04:58,554
technique that explains how machine
learning models make predictions.

68
00:04:59,054 --> 00:05:01,944
Moving to the next step, which
is real time anomaly detection.

69
00:05:02,324 --> 00:05:08,024
deploying with Kafka or Prometheus
or Elk can be more technical.

70
00:05:08,824 --> 00:05:14,044
Technical side of things and using
super wise learning and graph based

71
00:05:14,054 --> 00:05:19,394
dependency mapping for RCA and the
next step is automated remediation and

72
00:05:19,394 --> 00:05:25,564
decision support, whereas we integrate
with various it tools like ServiceNow,

73
00:05:25,654 --> 00:05:30,194
PagerDuty for auto ticketing and
leveraging the reinforcement from there.

74
00:05:30,694 --> 00:05:34,784
This, these all things will obviously
lead towards the continuous learning

75
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:41,554
of AI and security compliance, which is
compliance with various privacy laws,

76
00:05:42,054 --> 00:05:46,244
let's take a deep dive on
actual, understanding of what

77
00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:47,934
happens in a model training flow.

78
00:05:48,464 --> 00:05:52,504
So if we take a look at
actually collecting the data,

79
00:05:52,554 --> 00:05:54,524
sources and logs and metrics.

80
00:05:55,024 --> 00:05:59,774
Or post postmortems as well, feeding
that to, basically filtering that

81
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:02,254
more in the preprocessing and scoping.

82
00:06:02,754 --> 00:06:08,304
For feature engineering, then feeding
it to the model itself is the core

83
00:06:08,724 --> 00:06:15,024
aspect and model then categorizes itself
into supervised learning, unsupervised

84
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:22,244
learning and graph networks where it can
map various key aspects and, Understand

85
00:06:22,244 --> 00:06:27,804
it by itself and whereas validation
and we store some data to validate

86
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:29,914
and provide the feed feedback as well.

87
00:06:30,594 --> 00:06:36,004
Then comes the real time, RCA
deployment where the anomaly

88
00:06:36,014 --> 00:06:42,194
detection can actually happen and
prioritized root causes can be created.

89
00:06:42,704 --> 00:06:45,124
This leads to a human feedback loop.

90
00:06:45,134 --> 00:06:50,694
So where we evaluate, what,
Categorizes as an RCA or whether the

91
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:53,714
root cause is actually valid or not.

92
00:06:54,054 --> 00:06:56,574
And then update the data accordingly.

93
00:06:56,574 --> 00:07:02,424
And that entire loop goes, again to get
trained or to train the model itself.

94
00:07:03,064 --> 00:07:07,944
This in turn leads to remediation
automation and, suggest fix

95
00:07:08,034 --> 00:07:09,644
and fixes and also runbooks.

96
00:07:10,144 --> 00:07:11,884
So key challenges to implement, right?

97
00:07:11,934 --> 00:07:15,114
there are many issues and
these are the top five.

98
00:07:15,614 --> 00:07:19,024
The key challenges are like
high initial investment.

99
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:23,774
This entire scale is not
easy to implement as such.

100
00:07:23,774 --> 00:07:29,394
We need to have a lot of data storage,
processing power, and AI expertise itself.

101
00:07:29,894 --> 00:07:33,394
Picking a model, making sure they
are trained well and all this stuff.

102
00:07:33,994 --> 00:07:37,744
And the second thing is data
quality and availability issues.

103
00:07:38,244 --> 00:07:43,814
Incomplete, inconsistent or noisy data
always leads to model inaccuracies

104
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:49,684
and requires effective ETL process
so that the real time data pipelines

105
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:56,444
don't give any of the third key
challenges with third key challenge.

106
00:07:56,989 --> 00:08:00,779
which is false positives
and negatives in RCA.

107
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:04,449
needs continuous feedback
loops and human validation.

108
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:08,959
If not, the false positives
are very, common in nature.

109
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:13,429
And the fourth one is integration
complexity with existing systems,

110
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:18,859
like must work with diverse
IT environments, requires API

111
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:22,759
standardization so that seamless
inter, interactions can be happening.

112
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:26,649
And the fifth one is security
and compliance risk itself.

113
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:28,429
Let's look at the benefits.

114
00:08:28,859 --> 00:08:36,129
the benefits of AI powered RCA are
faster incident resolution, AI automates

115
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:40,749
the root cause analysis, reduces the
time to detect, And resolve the issues.

116
00:08:41,069 --> 00:08:45,529
it'll be proactive in nature
and pre and takes the measures

117
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:47,129
to pre, prevent the issues.

118
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:53,369
And the third one is improve accuracy
and consistency, which leads to

119
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:56,069
the cost savings and efficiency.

120
00:08:56,699 --> 00:09:02,089
this is definitely an scalable
architecture and adaptable

121
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:03,349
architecture as well.

122
00:09:03,849 --> 00:09:05,709
in order to give some quantifying.

123
00:09:06,214 --> 00:09:12,464
details are of the benefits itself,
if we see the table, which shows the

124
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:18,054
performance indicator, between legacy
RCA systems and AI enhanced RCA's,

125
00:09:18,484 --> 00:09:23,174
the manufacture system diagnostic
accuracy increased from 78 to 95 in the

126
00:09:23,174 --> 00:09:25,524
industries, incident resolution time.

127
00:09:26,074 --> 00:09:30,114
Decreased from eight hours to four
hours, annual system downtime costs

128
00:09:30,374 --> 00:09:32,594
decreased by 20 billion to 10 billion.

129
00:09:33,064 --> 00:09:38,534
the data processing efficiency on a scale
of one to 10, it's one for legacy RCA

130
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:40,864
system, which is more of manual process.

131
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:45,269
Whereas AI enhanced, it's 10,
but I don't quote me on that.

132
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:49,779
systems scalability rating, that's
definitely improved from three to nine.

133
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:56,619
So this entire thing reveals that AI
powered RCA delivers sustainability

134
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:58,529
improvements across all metrics.

135
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:02,999
The future of AI powered root cause
analysis, continuous innovation.

136
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,999
This is not going to stop just.

137
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:06,829
Just over here.

138
00:10:07,219 --> 00:10:12,239
it's more of going to transform
the entire industry and AI powered

139
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:16,009
RCS will become standard across
different other industries like

140
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:17,789
healthcare, manufacturing and finance.

141
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:24,289
And technology convergence is around
the corner because integration with IoT

142
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:30,419
sensors, 5G networks and edge computing
will enable instantaneous analysis.

143
00:10:31,144 --> 00:10:36,804
Strategic imperative is one of the
future for sure, which organizations

144
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:40,674
will leverage AIRCA as cornerstone
of digital transformations.

145
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:47,284
As we move deeper into this digital age,
AI powered root cause analysis will become

146
00:10:47,284 --> 00:10:49,784
fundamental to organizational success.

147
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:55,994
Companies that harnesses these advanced
capabilities will achieve unprecedented

148
00:10:55,994 --> 00:11:00,954
levels of operational efficiency,
dramatically reduce downtime, gain

149
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:06,064
agility, and also solve complex
technical, technological issues.

150
00:11:06,424 --> 00:11:10,954
In the landscape itself this evolution
in analytical capability won't just be

151
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:15,644
an operational advantage It will become
a critical differentiator in maintaining

152
00:11:15,954 --> 00:11:18,354
market leadership by driving innovation

153
00:11:18,854 --> 00:11:20,104
Thank you for your time.

154
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,394
have a nice day See you
