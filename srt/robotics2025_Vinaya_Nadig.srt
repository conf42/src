1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,205
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,765 --> 00:00:07,840
I am Vi Nading, a principal software
engineer, and today I want to talk about

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,049
data governance in AI driven banking.

4
00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:15,480
When you think about automation
in finance, think back to 2008,

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,180
the global financial crisis.

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,000
We didn't have generative AI then,
but we had algorithms making decisions

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,550
with opaque logic and incomplete data.

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,009
Fast forward to today, AI is
exponentially more powerful.

9
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:37,880
It's approving loans, flagging fraud, and
even advising investments in real time.

10
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:44,419
The difference, we don't ground
that ai, we risk repeating 2008,

11
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:46,550
but at mission speed, remember.

12
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:47,839
So yes.

13
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:53,260
Today's talk is about the least
exciting word in AI governance.

14
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:57,325
But ironically, it's the
one thing that keeps AI from

15
00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:59,065
becoming tomorrow's headline.

16
00:00:59,565 --> 00:01:00,825
So let's dive in.

17
00:01:01,325 --> 00:01:05,485
In the last decade, banking has
quietly become one of the most

18
00:01:05,485 --> 00:01:07,255
robotic industries on earth.

19
00:01:07,755 --> 00:01:14,535
In 2016, for instance, JP Morgan
introduced its coin platform, a contract

20
00:01:14,535 --> 00:01:17,480
analysis AI that completed in seconds.

21
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,800
What used to take lawyers $360,000 a year.

22
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,620
Around the same time fraud detection
models began processing billions

23
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:33,170
of credit cards transactions daily
AI isn't the future of ranking.

24
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,380
It's already embedded
in its nervous system.

25
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,420
Think of the last time you
got a transaction alert before

26
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,040
you even checked your balance.

27
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,650
That's AI driven.

28
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,450
Robotics in action scanning,
predicting, reacting, all gone

29
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,150
by data pipelines we rarely see,

30
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,270
but there's a catch.

31
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,670
80% of the financial institutions
say data governance is the

32
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,430
biggest barrier to scaling ai.

33
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,170
The average deployment
delay is six to nine months.

34
00:02:06,575 --> 00:02:08,825
Purely due to compliance reviews.

35
00:02:09,575 --> 00:02:16,775
When GDPR took effect in 2018, several
major banks had to pass their projects

36
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:21,155
for months just to trace how customer
data was flowing into machine learning

37
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:26,530
pipelines, one European bank discovered
30 different versions of the same

38
00:02:26,615 --> 00:02:29,285
data set being used across models.

39
00:02:29,585 --> 00:02:31,565
None with consistent consent tracking.

40
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:35,494
Remember, consistent
consent tracking is the key.

41
00:02:35,994 --> 00:02:37,284
That's the governance gap.

42
00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:42,764
AI moves at milliseconds, but
our controls move at human speed.

43
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:51,334
Without governance, AI innovation turns
into AI improvisation, and in banking,

44
00:02:51,934 --> 00:02:54,744
that's expensive, not tolerable.

45
00:02:55,244 --> 00:02:56,325
What do we do about it?

46
00:02:56,825 --> 00:03:01,685
The legacy systems fall
short in several parts.

47
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:05,405
They're not designed for
business intelligence.

48
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:10,885
They're slow batch oriented
and blind to model lineage.

49
00:03:11,515 --> 00:03:14,245
Remember the word model lineage.

50
00:03:14,745 --> 00:03:19,185
The first generation of
governance tools emerged in 1990s.

51
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:25,365
They were built for static warehouses,
monthly reports, and Excel exports.

52
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:32,204
Then came AI pipeline dynamic, constantly
evolving auto retraining models.

53
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:38,295
Those old systems simply can't track what
happens inside a neural network trained

54
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,584
across 50 data sources, for instance.

55
00:03:42,084 --> 00:03:48,254
When L-I-B-O-R Scandal broke in
2012, regulators demanded proof

56
00:03:48,404 --> 00:03:50,834
of data lineage in risk models.

57
00:03:51,224 --> 00:03:53,384
Most banks couldn't produce it.

58
00:03:53,884 --> 00:03:57,724
They couldn't because their
systems had no unified trays.

59
00:03:57,874 --> 00:04:02,904
From data origin to decision
output, why was this decision taken?

60
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,279
What was the input data used?

61
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:10,429
That's the kind of gap modern
AI governance must never repeat.

62
00:04:10,929 --> 00:04:15,009
So here we are introducing
the unified framework.

63
00:04:15,309 --> 00:04:20,009
To address this, we want to build
a unified data governance framework

64
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:25,469
engineer specifically for AI driven
robotics heavy banking system.

65
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:30,649
It embeds governance directly into
AI lifecycle from feature engineering

66
00:04:30,859 --> 00:04:33,049
to model deployment and monitoring.

67
00:04:33,549 --> 00:04:40,379
It has four pillars, meta management,
where it's the central catalog for

68
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:43,419
every single data, asset and model.

69
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,779
Then comes lineage tracking.

70
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:47,429
This is super important.

71
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:52,049
Every transformation, every
dependency visible end to end

72
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:54,324
Then comes quality monitoring.

73
00:04:55,184 --> 00:05:00,564
Any automated drifts, anomalies
by and performance checks had

74
00:05:00,564 --> 00:05:03,564
to be performed at rapid speeds.

75
00:05:04,164 --> 00:05:06,444
Finally, the cloud native oversight.

76
00:05:06,944 --> 00:05:13,814
Sub 200 milliseconds query response
tracking 5,000 or 10,000 model

77
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:20,214
updates daily because fraud does move
quicker, AI has to be on top of that.

78
00:05:20,714 --> 00:05:26,769
For instance, if you follow the UK's
open banking rollout in 2018, regulators

79
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:28,689
required every participating bank.

80
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:35,169
To log data moment and consent lineage,
that same philosophy, transparency through

81
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,939
transparency, through traceability,
is what this framework enforces.

82
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:46,649
But for AI systems, it's let less like
a gatekeeper and more like a air traffic

83
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:52,859
controller, ensuring thousands of AI
models take off safely without colliding.

84
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:54,949
Then comes security.

85
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:57,139
Security is the other half of governance.

86
00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:03,405
The 2020 Solar Winds breach reminded
us that software supply chains

87
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:05,684
can become invisible entry points.

88
00:06:06,184 --> 00:06:12,604
For ai, the equivalent risk is
data lineage hijack when upstream

89
00:06:12,604 --> 00:06:17,514
data is tamper and silently
corrupts the models and the output.

90
00:06:18,014 --> 00:06:19,424
So what do we do?

91
00:06:19,924 --> 00:06:26,159
We want role-based, role-based access
control for tens of thousands of users.

92
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:32,349
We want full audit trail for every
access event, we need integration

93
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:35,679
with enterprise identity systems.

94
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:37,889
Let's take examples.

95
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:44,844
The framework we build has
to support G-D-P-R-C-C-P-A,

96
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:48,444
basil three and BCBS 2, 3, 9.

97
00:06:48,944 --> 00:06:54,494
For instance, it mandates risk data
to be accurate, complete, and timely.

98
00:06:54,974 --> 00:07:01,784
That's nearly impossible without
automated lineage and validation systems.

99
00:07:02,284 --> 00:07:07,614
For instance, when European
Central Bank audited AI credit

100
00:07:07,614 --> 00:07:12,954
models in 2022, the number one
failure point was missing lineage.

101
00:07:13,344 --> 00:07:16,614
Between feature data
and regulatory reports.

102
00:07:17,114 --> 00:07:22,124
So governance season paperwork,
it's survival in banking.

103
00:07:22,624 --> 00:07:24,784
Let's jump into a real world case.

104
00:07:24,814 --> 00:07:29,649
For instance, a tier one global
bank adopted this unified

105
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:32,409
governance framework in 2025.

106
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:35,039
Within months, they achieved.

107
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:41,219
30% foster AI deployment, no
manual compliance bottlenecks,

108
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:44,689
40% stronger audit readiness.

109
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:49,909
Traceability became automatic a
hundred percent compliance across

110
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:53,119
GDPR basis three and BCBS standards.

111
00:07:53,619 --> 00:07:55,659
And here is an interesting anecdote.

112
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:59,259
During an internal audit,
the regulator asked them to

113
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:01,359
trace a fraud detection model.

114
00:08:01,794 --> 00:08:06,624
Back to its training data in
2019, that would have taken weeks

115
00:08:06,684 --> 00:08:10,044
or months, even months in 2025.

116
00:08:10,284 --> 00:08:16,614
The answer came up in 0.3 seconds
through a single governance query.

117
00:08:17,514 --> 00:08:22,964
That's not just efficiency, that's
cultural transformation, and

118
00:08:22,964 --> 00:08:24,739
that's what we are headed towards.

119
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,339
How do we scale this responsibility?

120
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:30,519
How do we ensure robotics ready?

121
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,329
Governance?

122
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:33,519
There are four pillars.

123
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,119
If you can think of foundation,
build on cloud native infrastructure

124
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,819
with embedded governance.

125
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:47,024
Link your AI lifecycle tools
directly to governance pipelines.

126
00:08:47,524 --> 00:08:52,984
Automation, continuously monitoring
for bias, RIF compliance anomalies.

127
00:08:53,484 --> 00:08:59,094
Finally, scale, expand innovation
safety across all AI workloads.

128
00:08:59,594 --> 00:09:04,489
An interesting anecdote comes
to my mind in 2012 when Netflix.

129
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:08,249
Move its entire recommender
system to the cloud.

130
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,329
They built observability into
the migration from day one.

131
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:15,049
Banking needs to take the same approach.

132
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:18,049
Governance first, not governance later.

133
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:20,499
Here's what I want to leave you with.

134
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:23,039
Governance is an enabler.

135
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,169
It doesn't slow innovation.

136
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:26,189
It unlocks it.

137
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:29,089
Again, it doesn't slow innovation.

138
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:30,259
It unlocks it.

139
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:35,209
If we don't follow governance,
we end up slowing our business.

140
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,739
Robotics demands real time systems.

141
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:44,469
Governance must match AI's velocity
without which it won't work.

142
00:09:44,969 --> 00:09:46,349
Compliance, trust.

143
00:09:46,349 --> 00:09:47,039
Trust.

144
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:50,009
That's the cornerstone of AI adoption.

145
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:58,989
Every financial revolution, be it ATMs
in 1970s to blockchains in 2010s face

146
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:02,079
skepticism until governance caught up.

147
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:08,679
Today's AI revolution is no
different, especially for banking.

148
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,899
We are not just building models.

149
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:15,814
We are building systems that
society has to trust with its money.

150
00:10:16,314 --> 00:10:23,664
So next time you see an AI approving,
a mortgage, flagging a transaction, or

151
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:31,764
detecting fraud, remember behind every
intelligent decision should stand and

152
00:10:32,394 --> 00:10:34,794
equally intelligent governance system.

153
00:10:35,294 --> 00:10:35,774
Thank you.
