1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:01,670
Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:02,719
I am Chirag.

3
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,570
I work at Nutanix in
cyber security with AI ML.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:14,520
so today I am going to cover a
presentation on pioneering AI frontiers

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,040
using deep learning based techniques.

6
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:21,209
So what is reinforcement learning?

7
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:26,920
So reinforcement learning right now is a
very new frontier in deep learning, and,

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,830
Reinforcement learning is, a learning
which involves complex decision making and

9
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:37,900
there are a lot of reinforcement learning
based models, which involves neural

10
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,030
networks, which are currently in use.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,945
And the current market of,
AI is going to increase.

12
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:46,995
As you see over here.

13
00:00:46,995 --> 00:00:51,015
It'll increase by one
90 mil billion by 2025.

14
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:53,740
Maybe by 2030 it'll be.

15
00:00:54,495 --> 00:00:55,815
Almost 10 times more.

16
00:00:56,495 --> 00:01:01,485
And these kinds of deep learning
techniques currently can

17
00:01:01,545 --> 00:01:04,465
outperform traditional ML models.

18
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:09,605
So that is why deep learning based
techniques are a lot in demand.

19
00:01:10,135 --> 00:01:15,084
These are, used in a lot of applications
like image classification, autonomous

20
00:01:15,314 --> 00:01:18,494
driving, and, many other, techniques.

21
00:01:19,309 --> 00:01:25,469
So the main core over here is a neural
network and reinforcement learning

22
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:30,789
basically is a technique which involves
interacting with environments and

23
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:33,079
using trial and error based approaches.

24
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:38,289
So wherever the neural network works,
it tries to find the errors, then it

25
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:45,919
will try to minimize the errors and in
turn try to So that is how the algorithm

26
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:52,119
works and combines deep neural networks
and also it has state space management.

27
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,559
Now we come to the milestones.

28
00:01:55,609 --> 00:02:02,199
The AlphaGo's victory over Lee Sedol
highlighted superhuman strategic planning.

29
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:09,329
Then in 2018, we saw UC Berkeley,
which enabled robotic kind of

30
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:11,629
grasping, high success rate.

31
00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:18,249
And in 2023, Waymo self driving cars,
they achieved 35 billion simulated

32
00:02:18,249 --> 00:02:20,289
and 20 million real time miles.

33
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:25,649
So these are very good achievements,
which have reinforcement learning using

34
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:27,619
neural networks, which are being applied.

35
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:30,079
Now we come to.

36
00:02:30,354 --> 00:02:33,574
Accelerating training
using transfer learning.

37
00:02:33,964 --> 00:02:39,204
So what is transfer learning in
reinforcement learning enables agents to

38
00:02:39,204 --> 00:02:41,964
apply knowledge from one task to another.

39
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:44,914
And significantly, this reduces the.

40
00:02:45,649 --> 00:02:47,789
Timing, training time, and effort.

41
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:51,219
So this is a key advantage
of this algorithm.

42
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:54,359
It has faster adaptation
to new environments.

43
00:02:54,369 --> 00:02:59,649
So these kinds of neural networks in
reinforcement learning have a capability

44
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:01,759
to adapt to any kind of conditions.

45
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:04,699
And reduce training data requirements.

46
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:09,579
So machine learning algorithms
work by training the data and then

47
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,789
generating some of the results.

48
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:16,389
So the more you train the models,
there is a chance of overfitting

49
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:17,989
and that kind of scenario.

50
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:21,149
So neural network over here is very.

51
00:03:21,929 --> 00:03:27,379
Optimized and it will try to train the
model with reduced data Requirements

52
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:32,779
and it will try to provide generation
and output in a short span of time

53
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:38,339
with high accuracy So that is why these
kind of applications like autonomous

54
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:43,469
driving, robotics, then game AI, all
these kind of applications, they are

55
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:50,139
using reinforcement learning and, these
kind of, machines, they leverage, such

56
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:54,109
kind of neural networks, which will
take some of the training data and

57
00:03:54,109 --> 00:04:00,419
generate proper, kind of output, which is
capable of, Of improving the experience.

58
00:04:00,429 --> 00:04:06,379
So for example, in autonomous driving,
the neural networks are so advanced

59
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:12,179
that they will be able to detect
anything in the road, any issues which

60
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:16,619
are happening in the road, and it
will apply the brakes, then it will

61
00:04:16,619 --> 00:04:18,809
accelerate at certain point of times.

62
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:25,089
And similarly, in robotics, the robots
can detect any kind of boundaries or any.

63
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:32,789
Places where they are not supposed to go
and games, they perform quite better and

64
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:37,689
it will help in better game generation
and using less training of data.

65
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:42,009
So this is where reinforcement
learning is a boon.

66
00:04:42,489 --> 00:04:48,294
And, then we come up over here in this
slide, it, it provides information

67
00:04:48,294 --> 00:04:50,424
about the generative AI market.

68
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:54,024
So how much is the market
capitalization right now?

69
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:59,674
And by 2030 maybe the project,
projected, capitalization will be

70
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:03,155
a lot more, almost around 33.7%.

71
00:05:03,185 --> 00:05:08,380
So it would be, I guess it would
be like, around 40 billion.

72
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,500
30 to 40 billion.

73
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:09,945
Yeah.

74
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,700
And, over here, we also have GANs,
Generative Adversarial Networks, and

75
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,039
VAEs, which is Variational Autoencoders.

76
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:23,889
These are two different kinds of
models, so Generative Adversarial

77
00:05:24,489 --> 00:05:30,189
Networks, they focus on generating
data and through training, whereas

78
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:35,599
Variational Autoencoders, they
are actually, they create compact.

79
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,420
certain kind of data representation
for generation, some kind of

80
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,270
analysis, that kind of thing.

81
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,850
So these two are very
different kind of models.

82
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:49,260
And let's go over here in
this slide, how they work.

83
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:57,360
So GANs are two networks, generator,
discriminator, they compete to

84
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,380
improve data generation quality.

85
00:06:00,215 --> 00:06:05,795
And basically it will be utilized
to generate certain kind of things

86
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:08,785
like for example, image generation.

87
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,215
Then we have video synthesis.

88
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:15,515
Then we have medical data augmentation.

89
00:06:15,535 --> 00:06:21,245
So which involves classification
and then we have drug discovery.

90
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:25,855
So all these applications are it's
covering something and using model

91
00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:30,255
training to perform certain kind
of generation, image generation,

92
00:06:30,745 --> 00:06:36,075
video synthesis, then medically
in medical field, it will try

93
00:06:36,075 --> 00:06:38,285
to improve the classification.

94
00:06:38,295 --> 00:06:39,905
which is a very important thing.

95
00:06:39,915 --> 00:06:44,700
Like you, Using certain kinds of
inputs, it will generate certain kind

96
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,490
of patterns and we'll try to find
out the pattern and classify into

97
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,250
better thing or classify a medicine
or classify certain kind of things.

98
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,450
And similarly in drug discovery,
GANs will try to kind of classify

99
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:04,770
and generate certain kind of modern
molecules for medicine development, maybe

100
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,950
fighting certain kinds of illnesses.

101
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,340
So we see GANs.

102
00:07:09,635 --> 00:07:15,295
will have a lot of capability in next few
years where it will not only improve the

103
00:07:15,325 --> 00:07:21,615
drug discovery, but also help in image
generation and maybe in cyber security or

104
00:07:22,005 --> 00:07:26,245
security and that kind of applications,
it will have a very huge impact.

105
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:32,545
Now, we come to VAEs and over here
how VAEs work, they encode the data

106
00:07:32,555 --> 00:07:37,115
into latent space and reconstruct
it, and that is how it will learn,

107
00:07:37,115 --> 00:07:39,698
and it will become more efficient.

108
00:07:40,248 --> 00:07:43,218
one good example over
here is anomaly detection.

109
00:07:43,638 --> 00:07:47,568
so whenever certain kinds of
neural network, they find certain

110
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:52,758
kinds of issues in the data,
it'll classify it as an anomaly.

111
00:07:52,758 --> 00:07:53,958
anomaly detection.

112
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,808
Then we have dimensionality reduction.

113
00:07:56,808 --> 00:08:03,473
So over here it'll have compressed
gene data by 98% and it'll,

114
00:08:03,473 --> 00:08:05,003
reduce the dimensionality.

115
00:08:05,003 --> 00:08:09,413
And thirdly, another use case
would be music generation.

116
00:08:10,008 --> 00:08:16,198
generated, 16 bar melodies and it will
have a lot of, satisfaction rates.

117
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:21,178
So these, these don't do any
kind of generation, but they try

118
00:08:21,178 --> 00:08:26,008
to do certain kinds of, anomaly
detection and that kind of thing.

119
00:08:26,628 --> 00:08:27,868
And these.

120
00:08:28,183 --> 00:08:33,223
techniques will become popular in next
few years, and it will be utilized

121
00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:36,033
in a lot of other applications.

122
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:39,183
Now we come to AI in cyber security.

123
00:08:39,743 --> 00:08:45,863
So in this cyber security, it will do
a lot of things like threat detection,

124
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:50,983
threat monitoring, and vulnerability
assessment and fraud detection.

125
00:08:51,753 --> 00:08:56,273
We do see a lot of, in, cyber security,
we see a lot of, certain kinds of

126
00:08:56,313 --> 00:09:02,493
threats are not monitored properly and
it leads to a lot of, issues and, a lot

127
00:09:02,513 --> 00:09:05,243
of threats and a lot of vulnerabilities.

128
00:09:05,553 --> 00:09:08,773
And there are, Current tools, which
are available in cybersecurity,

129
00:09:08,793 --> 00:09:12,053
they don't detect such kind of
vulnerabilities and threats.

130
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:19,213
maybe in next few years, AI using GAN
and VIEs with, these techniques, they

131
00:09:19,213 --> 00:09:24,183
will improve the threat detection
and anomaly detection And basically.

132
00:09:24,548 --> 00:09:28,798
in cybersecurity, most of the companies
won't use these kinds of tools and

133
00:09:29,128 --> 00:09:33,628
they will rely heavily in this machine
learning models and such kind of things

134
00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:39,558
to improve their security posture
and, use AI based threat detection.

135
00:09:40,108 --> 00:09:44,468
It can also do maybe in
future AI based techniques.

136
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:48,408
We can also do threat modeling
and, identifying risks, within

137
00:09:48,418 --> 00:09:50,228
the organization and maybe.

138
00:09:51,018 --> 00:09:55,098
Possibly detecting DDoS attacks
and such kind of things.

139
00:09:56,058 --> 00:09:58,318
Now we come to future trends in AI.

140
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:04,863
So in future trends of ai, we have graph
neural networks, which can enhance,

141
00:10:04,913 --> 00:10:10,513
AI's capability to process graph
structured data like social networks,

142
00:10:10,513 --> 00:10:13,543
recommendation systems and drug discovery.

143
00:10:13,543 --> 00:10:19,003
So graph neural networks are also very
important kind of neural networks,

144
00:10:19,003 --> 00:10:21,463
which can be utilized in recommendation.

145
00:10:21,953 --> 00:10:23,388
for example, we see in Netflix.

146
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:25,508
and Amazon prime.

147
00:10:25,518 --> 00:10:29,318
There are a lot of recommendations and
certain things which are being done.

148
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:35,218
So these company maybe in future can
leverage a graph neural networks and

149
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:41,648
such kind of sophisticated algorithms to
improve the accuracy of recommendation.

150
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:48,508
Then try to process text image or video
and certain kinds of applications.

151
00:10:49,453 --> 00:10:54,563
Then we have AI in IoT and
certain, other applications

152
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,063
where AI can have a huge impact.

153
00:10:57,613 --> 00:11:00,163
this is what we have seen
in enforcement learning.

154
00:11:00,183 --> 00:11:06,343
It has a lot of unparalleled capabilities
in doing complex tasks like autonomous

155
00:11:06,363 --> 00:11:12,483
driving, robotics, industrial
automation, and it uses GANs and VAIs

156
00:11:12,983 --> 00:11:14,813
to unlock a lot of new possibilities.

157
00:11:15,563 --> 00:11:20,523
Helping creativity and problem solving
these kind of approaches can help the

158
00:11:20,523 --> 00:11:26,193
organization to improve upon their
security posture, improve the drug

159
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:32,663
discovery and have a lot of big impact
in decision making capabilities.

160
00:11:33,013 --> 00:11:40,043
Even in cyber security, maybe 30 which
are being used, they might be either,

161
00:11:40,043 --> 00:11:46,453
GANs or VAEs, which can be used to detect
certain kinds of threats and improve the

162
00:11:46,453 --> 00:11:49,363
security posture within the security org.

163
00:11:49,863 --> 00:11:51,583
So that's it from my side.

164
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:53,833
If you have any questions,
please let us know.
