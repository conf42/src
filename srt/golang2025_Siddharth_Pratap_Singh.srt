00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,279
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:04,609
Today we are diving into a topic
that sets at the intersection of

3
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:08,570
privacy and innovation, privacy,
preserving search systems.

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,410
These systems are revolutionizing
how we retrieve information while

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,090
safeguarding sensitive data.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,980
Imagine searching for medical records,
legal documents, or financial transactions

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,410
without compromising confidentiality.

8
00:00:22,265 --> 00:00:25,325
This is the promise of modern
privacy preserving technologies.

9
00:00:25,355 --> 00:00:30,075
Over the next, slides, we'll explore
their evolution, core principles,

10
00:00:30,475 --> 00:00:33,175
some real world applications,
and what the future holds.

11
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:34,425
Let's get started.

12
00:00:34,925 --> 00:00:38,734
Okay, so if we look at the
evolution of search systems, then

13
00:00:38,794 --> 00:00:40,324
early search systems were simple.

14
00:00:40,684 --> 00:00:43,084
Think basic keyword matching
with no personalization.

15
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:46,054
You typed a query, you got
results, and that was it.

16
00:00:46,954 --> 00:00:50,674
Fast forward to today, insert
systems are extremely sophisticated.

17
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:55,114
They analyze user behavior, they
understand context and predict what you

18
00:00:55,114 --> 00:00:58,654
need, but with great power came a problem.

19
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:03,844
Privacy as data collection crews,
so it concerns regulations like

20
00:01:03,844 --> 00:01:08,405
GDPR and CCPA have emerged, pushing
engineers to rethink system design.

21
00:01:08,905 --> 00:01:10,705
Enter privacy by design.

22
00:01:10,765 --> 00:01:14,095
A philosophy where privacy isn't
an add-on, but the foundation.

23
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:17,515
Today's systems balance
hyper-personalization with robust

24
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:22,105
protections using technologies like
data minimization and encryption.

25
00:01:22,605 --> 00:01:26,325
This evolution isn't just
technical, it's ethical.

26
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:29,015
Now, what makes these systems stick?

27
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,590
Three core principles.

28
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,900
First, privacy By design.

29
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,110
This means building privacy
into every layer of the system

30
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,690
upfront, and no bandaid fixes.

31
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,360
Second data minimization Instead of
holding data, systems collect only

32
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,250
what's essential for their function.

33
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,890
Think of it as a lesser more approach.

34
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,410
Third, encryption mechanisms.

35
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,480
Data is encrypted at rest.

36
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,030
In transit and even during processing
together, these principles create

37
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,680
a trifecta of protection, but
it's not just about technology.

38
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,070
Systems also empower users
with control over their data.

39
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,070
Privacy becomes the
default and not an option

40
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,639
tying into some technical details.

41
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,760
So modern systems go
beyond basic encryption.

42
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:16,325
Take private information retrieval.

43
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:20,855
For example, with PIR, you can
fetch data from a server without

44
00:02:20,855 --> 00:02:22,145
revealing what you searched for.

45
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:27,145
It's like checking a book out of a library
without the library knowing which one.

46
00:02:27,645 --> 00:02:28,605
How do you do that?

47
00:02:28,655 --> 00:02:31,625
there are lattice based cryptography
and homomophic encryptions

48
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,815
that make this magic happen.

49
00:02:34,429 --> 00:02:39,350
Then there is secure multi-party
computation where multiple parties

50
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,049
collaborate on computations
without sharing raw data.

51
00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:46,244
imagine something like solving a puzzle
together while keeping your pieces hidden.

52
00:02:46,744 --> 00:02:51,964
And then if you add query obfuscation to
randomized searches and then distributed

53
00:02:52,024 --> 00:02:56,134
trust architectures, they will help you
to eliminate single points of failure.

54
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,174
And then you've got a privacy fortress.

55
00:02:59,105 --> 00:03:02,894
These mechanisms work together
seamlessly, proving that privacy and

56
00:03:02,894 --> 00:03:04,904
functionality aren't mutually exclusive.

57
00:03:05,404 --> 00:03:07,414
let's talk about machine
learning integration.

58
00:03:07,514 --> 00:03:09,014
that's the secret source.

59
00:03:09,044 --> 00:03:12,884
So Federated learning trains
AI models across decentralized

60
00:03:12,884 --> 00:03:17,474
devices, hospitals, for instance,
can collaborate on a diagnostic

61
00:03:17,474 --> 00:03:19,244
model without sharing patient data.

62
00:03:20,204 --> 00:03:24,105
Differential privacy adds mathematical
noise to data sets, ensuring

63
00:03:24,105 --> 00:03:25,929
individual data points stay anonymous.

64
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:28,679
Homomorphic encryption takes it further.

65
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:33,269
It allows computations on
encrypted data like doing math on

66
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:35,099
a locked safe without opening it.

67
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:38,579
It's very interesting and secure enclaves.

68
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:42,689
These are hardware isolated environments
like vault inside your computer,

69
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:44,619
protecting sensitive operations.

70
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:49,019
Together these technologies safeguard
privacy across the entire machine learning

71
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,374
pipeline from training to deployment.

72
00:03:51,874 --> 00:03:53,105
There are trade-offs.

73
00:03:53,605 --> 00:03:56,995
to be truly honest, it
does come at a cost.

74
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:00,835
These enhanced protections impact
performance of these systems.

75
00:04:00,835 --> 00:04:05,330
For instance, search relevance
has seen drop as privacy.

76
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,454
Privacy, measures tightened.

77
00:04:07,954 --> 00:04:11,635
Imagine, librarian whispering answers,
but occasionally getting them wrong.

78
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:15,644
Systems combat this with real time
monitoring to optimize accuracy.

79
00:04:16,144 --> 00:04:20,024
Query latency also increases,
because now you've got multiple

80
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:22,125
systems added to your stack.

81
00:04:22,425 --> 00:04:25,645
that's, adding extra heartbeats
for getting your results

82
00:04:25,645 --> 00:04:26,755
from your search index.

83
00:04:27,255 --> 00:04:30,885
And then computational costs,
they have skyrocketed because,

84
00:04:30,935 --> 00:04:32,615
there is a resource usage.

85
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,400
But there is a good news, automated
resource allocations here and adaptive

86
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,980
tuning keeps these trade offs in check
goal being, maximizing privacy without

87
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,510
turning your search into a snail.

88
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,109
Let's shift to real world impact.

89
00:04:47,109 --> 00:04:49,690
And healthcare privacy isn't
optional, it's life or death.

90
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,920
Systems have, you know where
insured patient confidentiality With

91
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,300
granular permissions, only authorized
doctors can access specific records.

92
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,750
Secure retrieval mechanisms comply
with HIPAA and GDPR, letting nurses

93
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,469
pull critical data during emergencies
without exposing sensitive details.

94
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:11,659
Audit trails, log every access
like a security camera for data.

95
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:16,229
these systems together prove that
even in a high stakes environment,

96
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:18,869
privacy and accessibility can coexist.

97
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:23,009
imagine a searcher, assessing
a patient's history instantly,

98
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:24,959
securely and without hesitation.

99
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:28,939
That's the power of privacy,
preserving search beyond healthcare.

100
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:31,709
another example is law and finance.

101
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:35,429
Legal discovery platforms handle
mountains of sensitive documents.

102
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:39,889
privacy preserving search ensures
that confidentiality during these

103
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:43,589
investigations, for example, like
fighting a needle in a haystack

104
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:44,789
without revealing the needle.

105
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:49,289
In financial systems, encrypted
transactions such as protect your bank

106
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:54,379
records, securely checking your investment
portfolio tax history without exposing it

107
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:57,229
to hackers is a very fundamental use case.

108
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:02,229
These sectors show how privacy preserving
technologies meet strict regulations

109
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,819
while keeping operations efficient.

110
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,569
Compliance then becomes built
in, and now it's not a hurdle.

111
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:13,059
Now, how successful are
these implementations?

112
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:14,619
Let's look at the numbers.

113
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:20,514
these are recorded over multiple use
cases that people have built, so I. some

114
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:25,434
examples that we've seen is healthcare
systems achieve around 90% success rates.

115
00:06:26,014 --> 00:06:29,294
similar, thing for legal
platforms a little bit less.

116
00:06:29,324 --> 00:06:34,404
They have around, similar adoption,
balancing confidentiality with usability.

117
00:06:34,914 --> 00:06:37,974
Financial services also see
a similar rate, even with

118
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:39,324
real time processing demand.

119
00:06:39,824 --> 00:06:41,234
we've seen this in hfds.

120
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,169
Each sector faces unique challenges like
healthcare's need for instant access

121
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:49,979
or finances, real time requirements,
but the results speak for themselves.

122
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,630
Privacy, preserving search
is proven and practical.

123
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,170
Now you're ready to implement.

124
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,750
What's the roadmap?

125
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,340
So what you can do is you can start
off with a modular architecture, embed

126
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,590
privacy into every layer, like building
blocks, address integration challenges,

127
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,540
especially with legacy systems.

128
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,090
You cannot just overhaul
everything overnight.

129
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,040
But incremental upgrades, work
deployments require structured

130
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,800
monitoring and incident response.

131
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,075
Think of it as a fire
drill for data breaches.

132
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:27,895
And then you can optimize your performance
by balancing security with speed.

133
00:07:28,105 --> 00:07:30,985
It's not about technology,
it's about strategy.

134
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,685
A well planned rollout, ensure success.

135
00:07:34,185 --> 00:07:36,735
So future directions and conclusion.

136
00:07:36,735 --> 00:07:37,305
What's next?

137
00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:38,355
The future is pride.

138
00:07:38,755 --> 00:07:42,805
reduced computational overhead will make
privacy techniques faster and cheaper.

139
00:07:43,344 --> 00:07:45,175
We are seeing it already happen.

140
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:49,515
Scalability improvements
handle massive data sets.

141
00:07:49,725 --> 00:07:53,595
You can think of global financial
networks or genome databases.

142
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:59,085
And then dynamic data handling will
secure real time streams like stock

143
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:03,205
trade or, information coming out
of the sensors of your iot devices.

144
00:08:03,705 --> 00:08:06,975
As regulations tighten, these
advancements will redefine how

145
00:08:06,975 --> 00:08:08,865
we balance privacy and utility.

146
00:08:08,985 --> 00:08:13,455
The next decade isn't just about better
search, but it's about safer search.

147
00:08:13,965 --> 00:08:18,285
In conclusion, privacy preserving
search systems are no longer optional.

148
00:08:18,525 --> 00:08:22,485
They are essential from all the
use cases that we have discussed.

149
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:25,845
Healthcare to finance These
technologies protect sensitive data

150
00:08:25,845 --> 00:08:27,555
without sacrificing performance.

151
00:08:28,485 --> 00:08:33,105
They proof that privacy isn't a trade off,
it's cornerstone of modern innovation.

152
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:35,495
thank you so much for your time.

153
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:36,225
please.

154
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:38,495
I'm happy to answer any questions.

155
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:42,515
I think they might have my email linked
so you can reach out to me in case you

156
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:44,314
have anything that you want to talk about.

157
00:08:45,035 --> 00:08:45,814
Thank you so much.
