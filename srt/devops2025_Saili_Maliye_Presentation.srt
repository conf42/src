00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,180
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,920
Thank you so much for joining me today.

3
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,260
I'm Saily, and I've been an
esthete for almost 10 years now.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,069
Over the years, I have worked on testing
a variety of systems, especially in

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,410
cloud and serverless environments,
and I've learned a lot along the way.

6
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:18,969
Today, I'm here to talk about mastering
cloud and serverless automation,

7
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:20,740
the esthetes guide to success.

8
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:25,155
I'll share some key lessons and practical
tips that truly work in this field.

9
00:00:25,595 --> 00:00:29,064
I'd love to hear from you,
your experiences, thoughts, or

10
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:30,314
anything I might have missed.

11
00:00:30,705 --> 00:00:33,475
I'll share my contact at the
end so we can stay connected.

12
00:00:33,855 --> 00:00:34,975
So let's get started.

13
00:00:35,475 --> 00:00:39,405
way we build and deploy software has
changed dramatically with the rise

14
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:41,285
of cloud and serverless technologies.

15
00:00:41,665 --> 00:00:45,345
This shift demands a new, more
adaptable approach to testing.

16
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:50,354
As esthetes, we need to evolve our
skills and strategies to stay ahead.

17
00:00:50,935 --> 00:00:54,995
Mastering cloud and serverless automation
isn't just a nice to have anymore.

18
00:00:55,375 --> 00:01:00,625
It's a must for ensuring applications
are reliable, scalable, and high quality.

19
00:01:01,084 --> 00:01:05,465
In this talk, I'll share strategies,
tools, and best practices that

20
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:09,040
can help you excel in cloud native
and serverless environments.

21
00:01:09,734 --> 00:01:12,854
These approaches will empower
you to become a key contributor

22
00:01:13,104 --> 00:01:14,284
to your team's success.

23
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,375
So why is cloud and serverless automation
so important in today's tech landscape?

24
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:22,645
First, the cloud environments are dynamic.

25
00:01:22,645 --> 00:01:25,945
Cloud Infrastructures change
and scale in real time.

26
00:01:26,645 --> 00:01:30,385
Automation is essential for
testing and validating these

27
00:01:30,385 --> 00:01:32,535
changes quickly and reliably.

28
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:36,825
Second, cloud native applications
have complex dependencies.

29
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:40,965
They often involve multiple
interconnected services, and testing

30
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:45,225
these systems end to end, without
automation, can be a real challenge.

31
00:01:46,195 --> 00:01:49,335
And finally, it's also
about cost and efficiency.

32
00:01:49,854 --> 00:01:52,905
Automation saves time by
reducing manual testing effort

33
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:54,645
and speed up release cycles.

34
00:01:55,435 --> 00:01:59,745
Plus, identifying defects early
can significantly cut costs.

35
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:06,560
With this foundation in mind, let's dive
into how we can master this critical area.

36
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,540
Let's start with infrastructure
as code automation.

37
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,030
If you're working in the cloud,
this is a must have skill.

38
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:19,440
ISE, or infrastructure as code,
lets us define and manage cloud

39
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,940
infrastructure using code, making
deployments consistent and scalable.

40
00:02:24,795 --> 00:02:28,735
However, misconfigurations can
lead to issues like security

41
00:02:28,735 --> 00:02:32,895
vulnerabilities, unexpected costs,
and performance bottlenecks.

42
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:39,055
ISE validation ensures that infrastructure
is reliable, secure, and compliant.

43
00:02:39,815 --> 00:02:41,455
So what tools can we focus on?

44
00:02:42,155 --> 00:02:46,035
We can start with Terraform,
AWS CloudFormation, or

45
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:47,505
Azure Resource Management.

46
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:50,604
here's some advice on automating
infrastructure as code.

47
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,854
Validating before deployment.

48
00:02:53,354 --> 00:02:57,374
write tests to validate your ISE
templates before deploying them.

49
00:02:57,774 --> 00:03:01,354
Tools like Teratest can streamline
and automate this process.

50
00:03:02,134 --> 00:03:03,894
Next, enforce standards.

51
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:08,154
Use linting tools like Checkout
to ensure your code adheres to

52
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,804
security, performance, and benchmarks.

53
00:03:11,304 --> 00:03:14,954
These tools can help maintain
coding standards across the team.

54
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:15,894
rollbacks.

55
00:03:16,634 --> 00:03:20,764
Set up automated rollback
mechanisms for failed deployments to

56
00:03:20,764 --> 00:03:22,864
minimize downtime and reduce risk.

57
00:03:23,364 --> 00:03:23,994
for drift.

58
00:03:24,364 --> 00:03:28,704
Regularly validate infrastructure drift
to ensure your configurations remain

59
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:31,094
consistent with your desired state.

60
00:03:31,594 --> 00:03:35,374
Now let's move on to API testing
for serverless application.

61
00:03:35,374 --> 00:03:38,314
APIs are the backbone of
serverless systems, enabling

62
00:03:38,314 --> 00:03:40,224
communications between services.

63
00:03:40,774 --> 00:03:45,894
Testing them is crucial to ensure they
work reliably under various conditions.

64
00:03:46,564 --> 00:03:47,694
Why is this important?

65
00:03:48,154 --> 00:03:50,974
APIs connect distributed systems
and serverless architecture.

66
00:03:51,454 --> 00:03:54,594
Without proper testing, issues
can ripple through the system,

67
00:03:54,904 --> 00:03:56,234
causing major problems.

68
00:03:56,484 --> 00:04:01,254
By testing APIs thoroughly, we ensure they
function as expected, even under stress.

69
00:04:01,754 --> 00:04:03,424
what are some tools we can focus on?

70
00:04:03,984 --> 00:04:08,294
There's Rest Assured,
Postman, Neumann, Karate, etc.

71
00:04:08,544 --> 00:04:09,964
There are some really great tools.

72
00:04:10,464 --> 00:04:13,174
our IDE approach, Automating API Testing.

73
00:04:13,884 --> 00:04:19,604
Start with functional tests to check API
responses, payloads, and status codes.

74
00:04:19,924 --> 00:04:22,064
This makes sure the basics are working.

75
00:04:22,564 --> 00:04:27,304
Next, move to integration testing to
see how APIs work together seamlessly.

76
00:04:28,014 --> 00:04:31,654
Use contract testing to validate
dependencies between services

77
00:04:31,924 --> 00:04:33,424
and ensure everything aligns.

78
00:04:33,944 --> 00:04:39,294
Try fault injection to test resilience
and error handling by simulating failures.

79
00:04:40,204 --> 00:04:41,984
Don't skip on security testing.

80
00:04:42,084 --> 00:04:46,499
Validate things like authentication,
authorization, and input sanitization.

81
00:04:47,124 --> 00:04:52,214
Finally, use schema validation to
make sure APIs meet specifications

82
00:04:52,514 --> 00:04:54,034
like OpenAPI standards.

83
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:57,674
Now let's talk about performance
testing and optimization.

84
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:02,639
Serverless applications bring unique
challenges, things like cold start,

85
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:04,819
concurrency limits, and scaling behavior.

86
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:08,689
These can impact your app's
performance and user experience.

87
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:13,679
If performance isn't optimized, your
app might struggle during traffic

88
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:17,874
spikes or leave users frustrated
by delays caused by cold start.

89
00:05:18,654 --> 00:05:22,744
Performance testing ensures your
app is both efficient and reliable.

90
00:05:23,554 --> 00:05:29,244
Tools like Gatling, JMeter, Artillery,
AWS X Ray are great options for

91
00:05:29,244 --> 00:05:30,694
testing serverless performance.

92
00:05:31,324 --> 00:05:34,264
So here's how I'd
approach automating this.

93
00:05:34,764 --> 00:05:38,784
user test traffic to test impacts
of cold start and concurrency.

94
00:05:39,384 --> 00:05:42,874
Monitor key matrix like latency,
throughput, and response

95
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:44,494
time under different loads.

96
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:48,679
Use distributed testing tools
to mimic large scale and real

97
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:50,619
world user scenarios effectively.

98
00:05:51,179 --> 00:05:54,679
Analyze results to identify
bottlenecks and fix them.

99
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:59,249
Test for scalability to ensure your
system can handle sudden traffic spikes.

100
00:06:00,134 --> 00:06:04,104
Automate performance testing as
part of your CICD pipeline for

101
00:06:04,134 --> 00:06:06,474
ongoing monitoring and improvement.

102
00:06:06,974 --> 00:06:11,164
Next, let's discuss observability
and monitoring integration.

103
00:06:11,774 --> 00:06:15,334
This is a, this is critical
for keeping systems healthy

104
00:06:15,734 --> 00:06:17,164
and resolving issues quickly.

105
00:06:17,914 --> 00:06:22,934
Observability provides real time insights
into how your system is behaving.

106
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:28,034
Without it, finding and diagnosing
problems can feel impossible.

107
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:32,579
But with the right setup, you
can catch performance issues,

108
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:35,009
errors, or failures as they happen.

109
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:39,459
Tools like Grafana,
Prometheus, Elk Stack, etc.

110
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,709
are powerful options for observability.

111
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:44,769
So let's see how we can
approach automating that.

112
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:51,559
We can set up automated alerts to notify
us of performance drops or failures.

113
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:56,889
Using dashboards to track key metrics
like latency, error rates, and uptime.

114
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:02,899
We can integrate observability tools
into CICD pipelines for immediate

115
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:04,779
feedback during deployments.

116
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:09,299
Leveraging distributed tracing to
understand how services interact

117
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,919
and pinpoint bottlenecks also helps.

118
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:16,979
Automating log aggregation to
simplify troubleshooting and ensuring

119
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,329
compliance is also very important.

120
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:21,239
Now let's dive into.

121
00:07:21,914 --> 00:07:24,604
CI CD pipelines for cloud environments.

122
00:07:25,254 --> 00:07:28,454
They are essential for
modern software delivery.

123
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:34,414
CI CD pipeline automation
and testing, validation, and

124
00:07:34,424 --> 00:07:36,554
deployment is all a key part.

125
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:42,744
They help deliver software faster,
more reliably, while reducing

126
00:07:42,745 --> 00:07:44,514
errors and simplifying development.

127
00:07:45,014 --> 00:07:50,274
There are tools like Jenkins, GitHub
Actions, Circle CI, GitLab CI CD, they

128
00:07:50,274 --> 00:07:52,114
are widely used and worth learning.

129
00:07:52,834 --> 00:07:54,694
So here's how I'd automate this.

130
00:07:55,484 --> 00:08:01,444
Embed automation tests in your pipelines
to validate code quality and deployments.

131
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:04,914
Use infrastructure as code
tools to quickly spin up and

132
00:08:04,914 --> 00:08:06,304
tear down test environments.

133
00:08:06,424 --> 00:08:10,824
Use canary deployments to test
updates in a controlled environment.

134
00:08:11,544 --> 00:08:14,614
Use blue green deployments
for zero downtime releases.

135
00:08:15,264 --> 00:08:19,604
Automate rollback mechanisms to
maintain stability in case of failures.

136
00:08:20,104 --> 00:08:24,504
automated security and compliance
check to ensure your system

137
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,914
stays robust and secure.

138
00:08:26,414 --> 00:08:28,914
Next up is fault injection testing.

139
00:08:29,414 --> 00:08:33,424
This is a proactive way to
improve system reliability by

140
00:08:33,454 --> 00:08:35,064
simulating real world failures.

141
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:40,864
Fault injection helps us find weaknesses
in our system before users are affected.

142
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:45,949
By intentionally introducing failures,
we can validate recovery mechanisms

143
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:49,339
and ensure the system is designed
to handle unexpected scenarios.

144
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:54,689
Tools like Chaos Monkey, Gremlin,
AWS Fault Injection Simulator,

145
00:08:54,989 --> 00:08:59,139
Litmus Chaos are excellent for
creating fault injection tests.

146
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,349
So here's how we can automate this.

147
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,089
Simulate failure scenarios
like network latency, timeouts,

148
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,479
or service unavailability.

149
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:12,079
Test for cascading failures in
microservices based systems to

150
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:14,149
understand how dependencies interact.

151
00:09:15,109 --> 00:09:18,399
failure scenarios to validate
your system's recovery and

152
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,129
self healing capabilities.

153
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:20,579
capabilities.

154
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:25,909
Integrate fault injection tests
into your CICD pipeline to make

155
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,089
this a consistent practice.

156
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:30,469
let's move on to security automation.

157
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:33,099
This is a critical part of
modern testing workflows.

158
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:38,259
As systems grow more complex, automating
security processes is essential

159
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:39,919
to stay ahead of vulnerabilities.

160
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:44,349
Security automation ensures
compliance with standards, identifies

161
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:47,689
issues early, and protects your
application from potential attacks.

162
00:09:47,739 --> 00:09:47,799
Thank you.

163
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:50,419
So here's how we can automate this.

164
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:56,119
We can validate APIs for authentication,
authorization, and input sanitization.

165
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:01,069
We can automate vulnerability scans for
infrastructure as code templates and

166
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:03,509
container images to catch issues early.

167
00:10:04,474 --> 00:10:08,484
We can test for common attack vectors
like SQL injection and cross site

168
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,364
scripting using automated tools.

169
00:10:11,304 --> 00:10:16,094
Integrate security checks in the
CICD pipeline to ensure compliance

170
00:10:16,174 --> 00:10:18,114
throughout development and deployment.

171
00:10:18,614 --> 00:10:22,734
let's discuss about automated environment
cleanup, a practice that's often

172
00:10:22,764 --> 00:10:24,854
overlooked, but highly important.

173
00:10:25,314 --> 00:10:30,184
In cloud environments, Resources can be
left running unnecessarily, leading to

174
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:32,134
increased cost in cluttered environments.

175
00:10:32,664 --> 00:10:37,234
Automating cleanup helps reduce
cost, prevents resource sprawl,

176
00:10:37,494 --> 00:10:40,524
and keeps environment consistent
for testing and deployment.

177
00:10:41,054 --> 00:10:44,774
Tools like Terraform, Ansible,
AWS Lambda are excellent for

178
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:46,164
automating cleanup tasks.

179
00:10:46,784 --> 00:10:48,834
So here's how we can approach testing it.

180
00:10:49,334 --> 00:10:53,244
We write test scripts to identify
and remove unused cloud resources.

181
00:10:53,814 --> 00:10:59,854
We use lifecycle policies to automatically
delete old snapshots or unused objects.

182
00:11:00,344 --> 00:11:04,184
We can schedule cleanup jobs to
run after deployments or test

183
00:11:04,194 --> 00:11:06,294
execution to keep environments clean.

184
00:11:07,264 --> 00:11:10,704
We can automate tagging and resource
tracking to manage resources more

185
00:11:10,734 --> 00:11:13,314
effectively and simplify cleanup.

186
00:11:13,814 --> 00:11:18,349
So now that we have explored the
key areas to master, We can shift

187
00:11:18,349 --> 00:11:21,789
our focus to strategies for future
growth and continuous learning.

Now let's look, let's look at some
best practices that can help us

211
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:45,039
approach cloud and automations,
serverless automations effectively.

212
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,289
First, start small.

213
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:51,969
Focus on automating one part of your
pipeline, like API tests, and then

214
00:12:51,969 --> 00:12:53,759
gradually expand to other areas.

215
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:58,659
Starting small lets you refine your
approach without getting overwhelmed.

216
00:12:59,219 --> 00:13:01,079
Next, fail fast.

217
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:04,219
Catching issues early in the
development cycle is key.

218
00:13:05,004 --> 00:13:08,784
Prioritize early testing to save
time and prevent problems from

219
00:13:08,824 --> 00:13:11,084
escalating further down the pipeline.

220
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:12,354
tests modular.

221
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:16,984
Writing small, reusable, and
independent tests is very important.

222
00:13:17,654 --> 00:13:21,904

235
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,329
foundation for long term success.

236
00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:06,989
Now let's wrap up with some common
challenges in cloud and serverless

237
00:14:06,989 --> 00:14:10,534
automation, along with practical
solutions to tackle them effectively.

238
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:15,114
big challenges with cloud
infrastructure is that it is dynamic.

239
00:14:15,494 --> 00:14:17,854
It spins up and down on demand.

240
00:14:18,114 --> 00:14:21,144
This makes it tricky to
keep testing consistent.

241
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:22,534
So what's the solution?

242
00:14:23,214 --> 00:14:24,924
Using ephemeral infrastructure.

243
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:29,614
Using tools like Terraform or
AWS CloudFormation to set up

244
00:14:29,624 --> 00:14:34,004
resources on demand and ensure
consistency across your environments.

245
00:14:34,504 --> 00:14:36,854
let's talk about cold starts
in serverless applications.

246
00:14:37,354 --> 00:14:41,774
Serverless functions can slow down
during their first run because

247
00:14:41,804 --> 00:14:43,304
containers take time to start.

248
00:14:43,804 --> 00:14:46,354
fix this, we can use warm up scripts.

249
00:14:46,574 --> 00:14:51,354
They keep the container active or
try caching strategies to reduce

250
00:14:51,354 --> 00:14:53,464
latencies during critical operations.

251
00:14:53,964 --> 00:14:56,649
lack of observability in serverless.

252
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,209
When we can't see what's happening
inside a distributed system,

253
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,539
troubleshooting issues become tough.

254
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:07,319
The solution is to use AWS
CloudWatch, Azure Monitor,

255
00:15:07,349 --> 00:15:08,919
or custom logging frameworks.

256
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:11,119
They give us real time insights.

257
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:15,839
Distributed tracing is also great for
spotting bottlenecks between services.

258
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:18,869
Next, tool chain complexity.

259
00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:23,519
Having too many tools for automation,
monitoring, and deployment can

260
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,919
make things messy and inefficient.

261
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:31,439
To simplify, pick a set of tools that
work well together and stick with them.

262
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:36,269
Make sure your document to
make sure workflow so your team

263
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,919
stays aligned and productive.

264
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:42,419
By tackling these challenges with
these strategies, we can build

265
00:15:42,469 --> 00:15:46,729
a solid and efficient automation
system that works smoothly in

266
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:48,439
