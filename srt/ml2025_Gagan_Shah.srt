1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,090
Welcome everyone.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,830
I'm Gagan pre sha.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,640
As someone who helped transform
LinkedIn's messaging platform.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,630
I've seen firsthand how communication
at scale reshapes everything

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,610
from relationships to revenue.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,410
Today, we are going to explore how AI
is not replacing human communication,

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,390
but partnering with it to make messaging
smarter, faster, and more human.

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,890
Like the Hitchhikers Guide
reminds us don't panic Messaging

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,880
is changing, but that change is
something we can reshape responsibly.

10
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:39,765
When I led LinkedIn's messaging
revamp, we moved from a rigid InMail

11
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:44,025
inbox to a dynamic chat interface,
but that wasn't just the ui.

12
00:00:44,505 --> 00:00:47,055
It required rethinking
how professionals engage.

13
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:54,090
We had to rebuild the backend for
speed, scale, and migrate 17 years

14
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,650
of messages with zero downtime.

15
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,670
And evolved norms around
tone and responsiveness.

16
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,930
The result was dramatic.

17
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,099
Conversations increased, users
reconnected more frequently.

18
00:01:05,789 --> 00:01:09,480
This was the moment LinkedIn
messaging became a living, breathing

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,470
network, not, not a slow email proxy.

20
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,130
My messaging matters.

21
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,180
Let's zoom out.

22
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,610
Why does messaging matter so much today?

23
00:01:21,105 --> 00:01:23,595
First, it's the backbone of modern work.

24
00:01:24,195 --> 00:01:28,785
People use Slack teams, LinkedIn
chats, Facebook messaging

25
00:01:29,085 --> 00:01:30,555
as their primary workspace.

26
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:36,135
Slack alone processes over 1.5
to 2 billion messages a week.

27
00:01:37,155 --> 00:01:39,975
Second, it accelerates decision making.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,179
What used to take hours by email can
now happen in minutes via messaging.

29
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,339
Third, it builds relationships,
mentorship, networking, deal making.

30
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:53,220
Often all of that starts with one message.

31
00:01:56,699 --> 00:02:00,574
Professional messaging has come
a whole long way from the dear

32
00:02:00,675 --> 00:02:02,550
sir. Dear Madam, email days.

33
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,500
We're in a world of back
and forth emoji LA chats.

34
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,200
This evolution isn't just about speed.

35
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,670
It's a cultural shift.

36
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,430
Messaging is now less formal, more human.

37
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,830
A casual, got five minutes.

38
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,640
Ping has replaced a long outstretched
outreach and persistent group chats.

39
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,830
That's today's virtual office where
ideas live, decisions get made and

40
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,420
alignment happens in real time.

41
00:02:33,734 --> 00:02:38,745
Scaling messaging is more, more
than just about the servers.

42
00:02:39,135 --> 00:02:40,665
It's about social complexity.

43
00:02:40,935 --> 00:02:46,935
As the platform grows, we see new
problems, noise, spam, etiquette, drift.

44
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:50,954
So we invested in
features that scale trust.

45
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,600
Spam filters, rate limits,
message invitations.

46
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,210
Read receipts, do not disturb statuses.

47
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,150
Scaling communication
isn't just technical.

48
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,920
It's cultural shaping norms,
expectations, and invisible rules of

49
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,650
interaction, as well as responding to
the changes in these changing norms.

50
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,500
This is where the magic starts.

51
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,890
Today's messaging tools
are already including ai.

52
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:26,010
Think smart replies don't checks live
translation and message summaries.

53
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,630
We've already been playing with that
in all the tools that we all use.

54
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,310
But here's the nuance.

55
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,990
The best experiences are AI
assisted, not AI authored.

56
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,480
AI helps draft coach contextualize,
but it's still the human who

57
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,550
decides, personalize and connects.

58
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,800
That's the loop.

59
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,320
AI offers scale and speed.

60
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,730
Humans bring the nuance and meaning,
and that's where the power is.

61
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,460
As I look ahead for the next five years,
this is where I think messaging is headed.

62
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,820
AI message assistance
will become the norm.

63
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,570
They'll triage, they'll
draft and they'll schedule.

64
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,960
But you come in and
figure out what to send.

65
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:21,390
The boundaries are gonna drop real time
multilingual conversations with tone aware

66
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,310
translations are gonna become the norm.

67
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,650
It's gonna be the basic expectation
we have, uh, from our tools, the

68
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,770
language and country and location
barriers are gonna melt away.

69
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,670
Thirdly, I believe context of aware chat
platforms that pull up relevant docs.

70
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:46,410
Flag risks as well as contextualize
your conversation is again, going

71
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,120
to be a step by step increase in
expectations from all customers.

72
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,390
You know, one platform will bring
it in and then it'll be everywhere.

73
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,690
Lastly, we've just scratched the
surface on our mediums, right?

74
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,590
Right now it's all text chat, but as.

75
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:12,120
We, we move into this era of,
uh, AI spatial messaging with

76
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,860
gestures, voice, and even ar might
start showing up in a small way.

77
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:24,090
And lastly, but most cri critically
AI secured systems that ensure

78
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,350
authenticity are going to be where
most of the innovation is gonna happen.

79
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:33,645
People are assuming it's gonna end
up being ai, talking to ai, whereas

80
00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:40,905
my belief is at the end it is a human
connection that's going to be amplified

81
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:45,015
with the tools that are evolving around
us, and it is the tools that will

82
00:05:45,015 --> 00:05:50,145
ensure that we can have more authentic
conversation and dispense with all

83
00:05:50,145 --> 00:05:55,725
the other formality that was needed
and years before the line between

84
00:05:55,725 --> 00:05:57,825
email, chat and meetings will blur.

85
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,300
But AI will bring us together

86
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,950
and as humans, what else would we want?

87
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,770
Uh, as, as product leaders, as we think
about where we spend most of our time, I

88
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,390
would say the rules are still the same.

89
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,490
Keep it simple.

90
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,180
If it takes four clicks, it's too much.

91
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:27,510
You know, build for trust,
let users control or decide.

92
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,050
What do you do with their
data and their inbox?

93
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,550
Don't blindside them.

94
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:39,630
It's trust is very difficult to gain and
very easy to lose and use AI thoughtfully.

95
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:43,680
I know everybody who's talking
about AI talks about this, but it

96
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,130
it, here, the guidance is clear.

97
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,300
It should be used to enhance, not
replace the human voice, because

98
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,740
then what's about messaging?

99
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:54,540
Um.

100
00:06:54,570 --> 00:07:02,010
L. We also need to think about
how to operate at scale planning

101
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,390
for billions of messages.

102
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,530
But protecting the experience is
a very fine balance to maintain.

103
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,940
And as product leaders, we need
to think about how we shape the

104
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:17,219
culture, the norms, as well as the
safeguards for safety in place,

105
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:20,610
uh, and.

106
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,890
Like all good product leaders, focus
on the outcomes, you know, optimize for

107
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,260
message quality, then count quantity.

108
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,880
Optimize for human connection
rather than message depth.

109
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,430
And, uh, make your messaging products
feel like a superpower, not just another

110
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,680
inbox because you know, God knows
if we need to learn another inbox.

111
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,610
Zero technique for new
AI enabled messages.

112
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,370
Lastly.

113
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:56,909
At the heart of messaging,
it's the human right.

114
00:07:57,299 --> 00:08:02,099
All of this AI scaling transformation
still leads back to one thing

115
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:07,469
that is people tools must
strengthen trust and connection.

116
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:12,750
Empathy, nuance and authenticity
can't be automated even if we try.

117
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,870
So we follow a human in
loop philosophy, AI assists.

118
00:08:19,515 --> 00:08:23,685
Never replaces because messaging
at its core is about relationships.

119
00:08:24,645 --> 00:08:26,625
That's where I see the future heading.

120
00:08:28,755 --> 00:08:32,175
And you know, like Douglas
Adams says, don't panic.

121
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:38,775
Uh, the Babelfish will let
you understand any a language.

122
00:08:39,705 --> 00:08:46,090
And in today's world, AI is our babelfish,
translating, suggesting, reminding, but.

123
00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:49,140
We are still the pilots.

124
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,680
AI can chart the course,
but we set the destination.

125
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:54,540
So here's my ask.

126
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:55,709
Build boldly.

127
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:01,500
Use AI to reduce friction, but keep the
human touch at the heart of your product.

128
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,800
And lastly, grab your towel.

129
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,089
Let's go build messaging
platforms worthy of the future.

130
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:10,260
Thank you.
