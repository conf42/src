1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:00,770
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,990
I'm Venugopal Reddy Deepa, and I'm
really excited to be here today to talk

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,480
about topic that is shaping the future
of healthcare API integration and how

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,370
MuleSoft is playing a crucial role
in advancing personalized medicine.

5
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:15,980
So let's start with a big number.

6
00:00:15,989 --> 00:00:20,890
So by 2025, the global healthcare
API market is expected to reach 62.

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:21,390
8%. Billion.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,190
So that clearly signs that healthcare
industry is going towards the digital

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,190
transformation at an incredible phase.

10
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:28,889
but here is the challenge.

11
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:32,860
Hospitals, clinics, labs and pharmacies
all operates on a different systems

12
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,839
that they don't communicate effectively.

13
00:00:35,419 --> 00:00:35,959
So what?

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,740
What does that lead to?

15
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,370
So doctor struggles to access the
patient complete medical history and,

16
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,249
test results being delayed due to the
disconnected systems and hospitals

17
00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:49,409
realized on slow manual data entry,
increased errors and inefficiencies.

18
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:54,059
So ultimately, this issue slows down
the patient's care, increase cost and

19
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:55,400
lead to the poor healthcare outcome.

20
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,490
but, there are a good, what
are the good news is the API

21
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,960
integration is solving all this.

22
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,410
So with MuleSoft API integration
approach, hospitals and healthcare

23
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,310
organizations are seeing a 65 percent
reduction in the integration time.

24
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,084
So think about what does means,
what user to take months or years.

25
00:01:13,085 --> 00:01:16,405
to integrate is now happening in the
fraction of time, allowing healthcare

26
00:01:16,415 --> 00:01:20,475
providers to adopt new technologies,
faster, improve workflows and focus on

27
00:01:20,475 --> 00:01:22,525
the patient instead of it challenges.

28
00:01:23,265 --> 00:01:27,185
So in today's session, I will walk through
you through the biggest challenges in

29
00:01:27,205 --> 00:01:31,375
healthcare data integration and how
new software integration approach is

30
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:36,155
solving these issues and how, AI and
real time, data and enabling personalized

31
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:40,675
medicine and real world case study where
API integration is transformed major.

32
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,330
Healthcare network and the impact of
diagnostics, cost savings and security.

33
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,490
So by end of the sessions, I hope
you will see the API integration is

34
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,950
not is just improving the healthcare
it, but it's transforming the

35
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,000
way we deliver the patient care.

36
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,890
So let's move on to next slide.

37
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,740
Okay, Before we talk about the
solutions, let's take a step back

38
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,300
and look at the major challenges
in healthcare industry today.

39
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,500
So despite advancing digital
health, many hospitals, clinics and

40
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:11,540
healthcare institutions still face
serious roadblocks when it comes

41
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,040
to share and access patients data.

42
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,654
So this challenges fall
into that category.

43
00:02:16,685 --> 00:02:21,415
three key areas like data
fragment and legacy infrastructure

44
00:02:21,465 --> 00:02:23,315
and regulatory complaints.

45
00:02:23,345 --> 00:02:24,865
So coming to data fragments.

46
00:02:24,865 --> 00:02:27,125
So one of the biggest
issues is healthcare.

47
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:30,745
Today is how scattered patients
treat is across multiple systems.

48
00:02:31,365 --> 00:02:35,445
So 75 percent of healthcare organizations
struggle to connect patients

49
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:37,035
because across different platforms.

50
00:02:37,475 --> 00:02:41,375
So a single hospital must coordinate
patients across 18 different

51
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,945
electronic health record systems.

52
00:02:43,335 --> 00:02:46,834
So on top of that, hospitals
manage 450 terabytes of data.

53
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:50,685
patient's imaging data equivalent
to millions of medical images.

54
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:52,085
What does it mean?

55
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:55,035
So doctors many times don't
have full picture of, patient

56
00:02:55,045 --> 00:02:56,055
health care in real time.

57
00:02:56,775 --> 00:03:01,945
So imaging a cancer patient recording
being split across different hospitals,

58
00:03:01,945 --> 00:03:06,695
labs, and pharmacies, if these systems
don't communicate, doctors might miss

59
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:10,744
critical test results or pass treatments
leading to delayed care and repeat tests

60
00:03:10,744 --> 00:03:12,825
and potential diagnosis will happen.

61
00:03:13,415 --> 00:03:17,715
So Without seeming way to integrate
data, patient care slows down and

62
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:19,565
error increases and costs go up.

63
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,295
So in the second one,
legacy infrastructure.

64
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:25,155
hospitals and health institutions
depends on technology to power

65
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:26,895
increase critical operations.

66
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:28,125
But here's the problem.

67
00:03:28,145 --> 00:03:32,045
81 percent of healthcare institutions
are still running systems that

68
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,275
are 10, 8 to 15 years of old.

69
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:36,985
So These legacy platforms process 1.

70
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:41,625
2 million daily transactions, but they
were never designed for today's fast

71
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,915
moving and data driven environment.

72
00:03:44,305 --> 00:03:45,895
So why this is a problem.

73
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:50,885
So this outdated systems create
bottlenecks, slow down the flow of

74
00:03:50,895 --> 00:03:55,075
critical medical data when hospital
doctors and nurse spend more time.

75
00:03:55,205 --> 00:03:58,445
navigating outdated software instead
of focusing on the patient care.

76
00:03:58,885 --> 00:04:03,885
So in today's world where real time
data, saves lives, hospitals can suffer

77
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:06,055
to rely on slow disconnected systems.

78
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:08,455
So next one is regulatory complaints.

79
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:14,045
So keeping the patient's data secure,
healthcare is one of the most heavy

80
00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:18,207
regulated industry because of patient
privacy laws, data security laws,

81
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:20,852
rules, and, strict compliance standards.

82
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:21,992
every healthcare.

83
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:26,637
Facility is responsible for
safeguarding over 280, 000 patient

84
00:04:26,677 --> 00:04:31,637
records, and 92 percent of healthcare
organization report major challenges

85
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:34,927
in maintaining the compliance
across their integrated systems.

86
00:04:34,927 --> 00:04:38,657
So these compliance challenges
cause critical project delays,

87
00:04:38,707 --> 00:04:44,257
averaging 187 days, that's more
than six months of setbacks.

88
00:04:44,747 --> 00:04:46,167
So why does this matter?

89
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:47,717
So non compliance can result.

90
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:52,002
Hi, T. Finds legal risk
and loss of patient stress.

91
00:04:52,002 --> 00:04:56,562
So data breaches in health care cost on
average of 10 million per incident, making

92
00:04:57,182 --> 00:04:59,022
security failures with incredible cost.

93
00:04:59,462 --> 00:05:03,842
So at the same time, hospitals need
to share patients data securely

94
00:05:03,872 --> 00:05:06,392
across different systems to
make sure doctors have the right

95
00:05:06,392 --> 00:05:07,592
information at the right time.

96
00:05:08,232 --> 00:05:09,732
So why does this matters?

97
00:05:09,782 --> 00:05:11,502
And how do we solve these problems?

98
00:05:11,622 --> 00:05:13,962
he's these challenges is.

99
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:19,752
Fragmented data or data system and complex
compliance requirements, all creating

100
00:05:19,802 --> 00:05:23,992
roadblocks that slows down the healthcare
innovations and impacting patient's care.

101
00:05:24,432 --> 00:05:27,492
So that's where API
integration comes into picture.

102
00:05:27,502 --> 00:05:30,842
By connecting systems, automating
workflows, and making sure secure

103
00:05:30,842 --> 00:05:35,342
data across APIs allows hospitals to
break down into CLEOs, modernization

104
00:05:35,342 --> 00:05:39,282
infrastructure, and complying with
regulations without completely

105
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:41,532
replacing their existing IT systems.

106
00:05:41,572 --> 00:05:44,192
And this is exactly
where API led approach.

107
00:05:44,892 --> 00:05:45,842
makes a difference.

108
00:05:46,342 --> 00:05:50,732
Now that we discussed the challenges
in the healthcare industry, let's talk

109
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:55,512
about the how MuleSoft API LateConnect
approach solves these problems.

110
00:05:55,642 --> 00:06:00,782
So MuleSoft uses three layer API
architecture that creates a seamless,

111
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:03,112
secure and efficient healthcare ecosystem.

112
00:06:03,132 --> 00:06:08,472
Instead of replacing old systems,
it connects them, allowing workflow

113
00:06:08,472 --> 00:06:10,272
automation, a better user experience.

114
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:15,422
So system APIs, Connecting to the
legacy systems of instance data access.

115
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:21,082
So usually hospitals still rely on
the old disconnected systems, make

116
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:25,252
it difficult to retrieve patient
records and system APS act as a

117
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:29,412
bridge between the systems, allowing
data to flow securely and instantly.

118
00:06:29,832 --> 00:06:30,592
So 75.

119
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:36,519
78 percent of reduction in data access
time, meaning doctors and nurses can

120
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:41,527
quickly retrieve a critical patient record
instead of waiting on slow manual process.

121
00:06:41,987 --> 00:06:46,297
And this API standardized
complex medical data for mix.

122
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:52,107
Ensures that data from different
hospitals, labs and pharmacies can be

123
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:57,057
accessed in unified format that leads to
the faster diagnosis, quicker treatment

124
00:06:57,067 --> 00:07:00,167
decisions and improve the coordination
between the health care providers.

125
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:04,157
So other layer process API
automates workflows and.

126
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:05,527
Treatment protocols will follow.

127
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:10,887
So process APIs plays a crucial role
in orchestrating clinical workflows and

128
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,977
automating complex health care processes.

129
00:07:13,547 --> 00:07:17,837
So 63 percent of reduction in treatment
protocols implementing time, which

130
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:22,067
means that patient receives the right
patient faster and more efficiently.

131
00:07:22,907 --> 00:07:26,437
This API reduction medical errors
by making sure in the lab results.

132
00:07:26,872 --> 00:07:30,322
Prescriptions and treatments plans are
automatically updated across systems,

133
00:07:30,682 --> 00:07:34,792
and they also automated insurance
claims process appointment scheduling

134
00:07:34,812 --> 00:07:38,782
and, prescription, renewals, reductions
and workflows for medical staff.

135
00:07:39,102 --> 00:07:42,092
on the other hand, experience
API enhancing user experience

136
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:43,172
and patient engagement.

137
00:07:43,632 --> 00:07:48,702
So experience APIs make healthcare data
accessible in a simple, secure and user

138
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:53,782
friendly way for both So 82 percent of
increasing provider satisfaction because

139
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:58,122
doctors and nurses no longer have a
deal with slow, outdated interface.

140
00:07:58,852 --> 00:08:03,232
So these APIs power personalized
patient protocols, allowing end users

141
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:08,572
to view their health records and track
medications and schedule appointments.

142
00:08:08,992 --> 00:08:10,092
So why does it matter?

143
00:08:10,592 --> 00:08:15,502
By combining systems, process and
experience APIs, MuleSoft creates

144
00:08:15,502 --> 00:08:19,682
a fully integrated healthcare
environment where data flows

145
00:08:19,682 --> 00:08:24,842
seamlessly between the hospitals,
labs, pharmacies, and patient portals.

146
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:28,942
And treatments workflows are automated,
reducing delays and human errors, and

147
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:33,402
doctors and patients have easily Access
to critical information, improving the

148
00:08:33,402 --> 00:08:35,652
decision making, the case, outcomes.

149
00:08:36,152 --> 00:08:40,002
So MuleSoft API led approach isn't
just about the IT, it's about

150
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,982
transforming the way healthcare
is delivered, make it faster,

151
00:08:42,992 --> 00:08:46,042
smarter, and more, patient centered.

152
00:08:46,697 --> 00:08:47,987
Let's move on to the other slide.

153
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:53,167
Okay, now that we have seen the MuleSoft
API led approach connects healthcare

154
00:08:53,257 --> 00:08:58,997
systems, let's talk about how integration
is driving personalized medicine, where

155
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:02,577
treatments are trialized specifically to
each patient's unique healthcare profile.

156
00:09:03,507 --> 00:09:07,697
Today, healthcare is shifting from one
size fits all treatments to data driven

157
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:12,527
personalized care and APIs are playing
a crucial role in making these problems.

158
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:18,497
So there are three major ways APIs are
transforming personalized medicine.

159
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:22,007
First one is real time data integration.

160
00:09:22,017 --> 00:09:24,717
This is nothing but the fastest,
smarter, and decision making.

161
00:09:25,137 --> 00:09:28,247
So one of the biggest challenges
in medicine is getting the right

162
00:09:28,957 --> 00:09:30,627
data to doctors at the right time.

163
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:34,747
with MuleSoft API powered real time
data integration, we have processed 1.

164
00:09:34,747 --> 00:09:37,747
5 million patient data
points every second.

165
00:09:38,347 --> 00:09:42,497
this has resulted in 71 percent
patient, clinical decision making,

166
00:09:42,497 --> 00:09:46,447
meaning doctors can act quickly,
improving the patient outcomes.

167
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:50,187
with better data availability, we
have seen 48 percent of increase in

168
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:54,607
early disease detection, helping catch
illness before they become critical.

169
00:09:55,267 --> 00:09:59,117
Okay, and Treatments are now 62
percent more effective because they

170
00:09:59,117 --> 00:10:04,147
are based on the precise data driven
care plans, televised to each patient.

171
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:06,107
So what does this mean for patient?

172
00:10:06,117 --> 00:10:09,887
Imagine a heart disease patient
whose risk factors are identified

173
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:13,887
early, allowing doctor to start the
treatment before symptoms even appear.

174
00:10:14,307 --> 00:10:17,247
That's where the power of real time
integration and patient data will come

175
00:10:17,247 --> 00:10:20,027
into picture and advanced analytics.

176
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,977
So this comes as a AI powered
diagnostics and genetics insights.

177
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,437
So data alone isn't enough.

178
00:10:26,437 --> 00:10:30,187
So we need advanced analytics
to extract insights and make

179
00:10:30,187 --> 00:10:31,647
it actionable for doctors.

180
00:10:31,657 --> 00:10:34,487
So our AI powered imagining systems.

181
00:10:34,507 --> 00:10:39,507
process 920, 000 medical images
every day with 82 percent of greater

182
00:10:39,507 --> 00:10:43,347
accuracy, helping doctors spot
small but critical details that

183
00:10:43,347 --> 00:10:44,577
could be otherwise be missing.

184
00:10:45,267 --> 00:10:49,797
So genetic data analysis is
now 88 percent faster, allowing

185
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:51,647
physicians to create a heavily.

186
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:55,417
targeted personalized treatment
plans for over 28, 000 patients

187
00:10:55,457 --> 00:10:57,257
per facility each year.

188
00:10:57,547 --> 00:11:01,357
So what does this mean for patients
is instead of writing weeks for,

189
00:11:01,497 --> 00:11:06,027
genetic testing results, a cancer
patient can now receive a personalized

190
00:11:06,047 --> 00:11:07,497
treatment plans with hours.

191
00:11:07,707 --> 00:11:10,777
Improving, survivor rates
and treatment effectiveness.

192
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:13,817
So that one is clinical decision support.

193
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:16,437
that is nothing but AI
assisted smarter healthcare.

194
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:21,407
So with healthcare becoming a more complex
doctors need intelligent systems to

195
00:11:21,407 --> 00:11:23,427
assist them in making the best decisions.

196
00:11:23,457 --> 00:11:27,827
So our API driven clinical decision
support system is transforming

197
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,467
how care is, care is delivered.

198
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:33,047
So in, it handles 3.

199
00:11:33,047 --> 00:11:34,017
2 million clinical.

200
00:11:34,287 --> 00:11:38,507
Decisions daily with 98 percent
accuracy, helping doctors to

201
00:11:38,507 --> 00:11:40,367
make the best possible choices.

202
00:11:40,997 --> 00:11:43,877
treatment matching has improved by 68%.

203
00:11:43,907 --> 00:11:46,677
Make sure in patient received
the most efficient care of

204
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:47,997
their specific conditions.

205
00:11:48,847 --> 00:11:54,197
And most importantly, adverse drug
reactions have been reduced by 45%.

206
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:56,227
Thanks to smart, medical recommendations.

207
00:11:56,227 --> 00:11:59,477
So what does it mean for
the patient, a patient with.

208
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:03,387
Multiple chronic conditions can
now receive a personalized medicine

209
00:12:03,437 --> 00:12:07,327
plan that minimizes side effects
and improves the quality of life.

210
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:08,177
Okay.

211
00:12:08,677 --> 00:12:13,187
Now, why this matters by integrating
real time patient's data, AI powered

212
00:12:13,237 --> 00:12:16,437
analytics, and clinical decision support.

213
00:12:17,017 --> 00:12:22,557
We are making Medicine more precise,
more efficient and more patient center.

214
00:12:22,637 --> 00:12:24,997
So doctors get the data
they have instantly.

215
00:12:25,347 --> 00:12:28,647
Patient receive personalized treatment
trailer to their genetic and health

216
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:32,467
history and AI powered insights to
help prove errors and improve outcomes.

217
00:12:32,977 --> 00:12:35,857
So let's talk about the
unified data access.

218
00:12:35,857 --> 00:12:42,017
So doctors now access 15, 800 patients
data points per consult consultation

219
00:12:42,017 --> 00:12:44,857
compared to just 2, 900 previously.

220
00:12:45,487 --> 00:12:49,667
So this means that physicians no longer
need To manually pull records from

221
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:53,217
different systems, they get all the
relevant data in one place instantly.

222
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,807
So faster access to critical
information lead to early detection

223
00:12:56,807 --> 00:12:58,177
and better treatment decisions.

224
00:12:58,217 --> 00:13:03,517
Example, imagining an emergency case where
a doctor needs to check a patient's past

225
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:06,467
imaging lab records and genetic makers.

226
00:13:06,507 --> 00:13:09,417
Instead of searching a multiple
system, they get everything in one

227
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:11,277
unified dashboard in real time.

228
00:13:12,187 --> 00:13:13,777
Other one is lab integration.

229
00:13:13,777 --> 00:13:16,377
So it's a fast and more
accurate test results.

230
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:21,177
real time synchronization of lab data
has, accumulated diagnosis time by 74%.

231
00:13:21,737 --> 00:13:26,527
So automated lab data integration
that just manually data errors,

232
00:13:26,577 --> 00:13:30,237
ensuring doctors have the most up
to date test results in instantly.

233
00:13:30,737 --> 00:13:33,237
So third one is imagine analysis.

234
00:13:33,352 --> 00:13:36,372
This enhanced the radiology
and AI powered scans.

235
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:41,252
So MuleSAR platform enables real
time integration of imaging data.

236
00:13:41,312 --> 00:13:44,192
So improving diagnostic
speeds and accuracy.

237
00:13:44,632 --> 00:13:50,312
So imaging analysis accuracy has increased
by 82 percent allowing AI powered

238
00:13:50,322 --> 00:13:54,742
tools to detect early signs of disease
like cancer and neurological disorder.

239
00:13:55,652 --> 00:13:57,042
So false.

240
00:13:57,762 --> 00:14:02,382
Positive has been reduced and minimizing
cancer treatments and anxiety of

241
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:03,812
the patients will be reduced here.

242
00:14:04,372 --> 00:14:07,282
So third one is genetic analysis.

243
00:14:07,322 --> 00:14:10,602
This is nothing but 88 percent
faster genetic data process

244
00:14:10,622 --> 00:14:14,342
allowing for faster and more
efficient transform treatment plans.

245
00:14:14,862 --> 00:14:19,802
So genetic makers are now analyzed
alongside lab and imaging data

246
00:14:19,802 --> 00:14:24,322
providing a more compressive
approach to, disease treatment.

247
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,692
And, fifth one is, The
predictive analysis.

248
00:14:27,722 --> 00:14:32,872
AI driven predictive analysis
help identify at risk patient

249
00:14:32,882 --> 00:14:34,712
before symptoms even appear.

250
00:14:34,712 --> 00:14:38,252
diagnostic error rate have
dropped by 63 percent reducing the

251
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:40,992
unnecessary hospital readiness.

252
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:44,862
And, With seeming less integration
of lab reports, imagining data and

253
00:14:44,862 --> 00:14:49,402
genetical analyzing, MuleSoft platform
say define diagnostic in healthcare.

254
00:14:49,412 --> 00:14:54,002
So doctors know receive a complete
real time patient profile, leading

255
00:14:54,022 --> 00:14:55,592
to faster and more accurate.

256
00:14:56,092 --> 00:14:59,712
diagnosis and, treatment plans
are trialized based on real

257
00:14:59,722 --> 00:15:01,372
time data, improving outcomes.

258
00:15:01,872 --> 00:15:06,332
So let's talk about diagnostics to the
next level with AI power technology.

259
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:12,102
So AI is revolutionizing healthcare and
doctors to detect disease early, analyze

260
00:15:12,142 --> 00:15:16,992
genetic data faster and predict patient
outcomes with Unpredictable accuracy.

261
00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:22,132
So by combining AI and real time data
integration, we are moving from reactive

262
00:15:22,132 --> 00:15:27,132
in healthcare, treating disease after they
occur to proactive care and preventing

263
00:15:27,682 --> 00:15:29,702
illness before they even develop.

264
00:15:30,202 --> 00:15:31,727
AI can analyze 2.

265
00:15:31,787 --> 00:15:33,677
1 million diagnostic images per day.

266
00:15:34,607 --> 00:15:38,427
So this has led to thousands of
life saving early, interventions

267
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:41,667
preventing diseases from
progressing to critical stages.

268
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:43,987
And second is genetic analysis.

269
00:15:44,307 --> 00:15:48,357
So generally key analysis has
transformed medicine, but analyzing

270
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:53,267
vast amounts of genetic data used
to take days of days or even weeks.

271
00:15:53,677 --> 00:15:57,737
So now with AI driven genetic
analysis, our system achieves

272
00:15:57,737 --> 00:15:59,707
99 percent of accuracy in.

273
00:16:00,142 --> 00:16:03,872
genetic profiling, helping
identifying here data conditions

274
00:16:03,872 --> 00:16:04,912
and treatment processing.

275
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:11,462
And the process is 32, 000 genetic profile
daily in under four minutes per patients.

276
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:16,722
So this means that doctors can instantly
Match patients with most effective

277
00:16:16,762 --> 00:16:21,372
personalized treatment plans and,
and, prediction capabilities will

278
00:16:21,402 --> 00:16:25,062
comes into picture like forecasting
patients outcome before systems develop.

279
00:16:25,722 --> 00:16:31,122
So predicting patient comes user to
rely on past experience and intuition,

280
00:16:31,132 --> 00:16:33,517
but no, I can analyze millions of.

281
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:39,077
clinical cases to forecast healthcare
risk with extreme accuracy.

282
00:16:39,377 --> 00:16:44,097
So our prediction model modelizing
achieves 93 percent of accuracy in

283
00:16:44,097 --> 00:16:48,687
forecasting patient outcomes with
30 days and system analyzes 4.

284
00:16:48,687 --> 00:16:52,747
2 million clinical data points daily
providing proactive alerts to the doctors.

285
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:57,977
So this helps preventing complications
before they occur, allowing for

286
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:00,267
Early inventions and save lives.

287
00:17:00,637 --> 00:17:05,197
And why this matters with AI
power diagnostics and we are not

288
00:17:05,327 --> 00:17:08,867
just improving medicine, we are
changing the way healthcare works.

289
00:17:09,437 --> 00:17:13,707
So doctors can detect disease sooner,
leading the early treatment and better

290
00:17:13,707 --> 00:17:19,007
survival rates and genetic analysis allows
for prediction medicine, making sure every

291
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:20,937
patient gets the right treatment faster.

292
00:17:21,777 --> 00:17:23,137
Let's talk about the slide.

293
00:17:23,637 --> 00:17:26,517
Now let's move on from technology
theory to real world impact

294
00:17:26,557 --> 00:17:28,137
with groundbreaking case study.

295
00:17:28,607 --> 00:17:31,977
this case focus on one of the
America largest healthcare networks,

296
00:17:32,357 --> 00:17:37,617
which includes 920 healthcare,
facilitates and serves as 13.

297
00:17:37,617 --> 00:17:38,787
8 million patients annually.

298
00:17:39,637 --> 00:17:43,107
So before implementing
MuleSoft APL integration.

299
00:17:43,857 --> 00:17:47,867
This network struggles with slow
system deployments, high operation

300
00:17:47,897 --> 00:17:49,857
costs, and outdated infrastructure.

301
00:17:50,127 --> 00:17:54,107
however, by modernizing their
systems and streamlining integration,

302
00:17:54,617 --> 00:17:56,257
the results were transformative.

303
00:17:56,577 --> 00:18:02,757
68 percent of faster system integrations
from around 210 days to just 58 days.

304
00:18:03,257 --> 00:18:05,307
Okay, Let's break down
to key achievements.

305
00:18:05,807 --> 00:18:07,317
Let's break down to key achievements.

306
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:11,237
So before MuleSoft, deploying a
new system across facility took

307
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:13,657
210 days, almost like 7 months.

308
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:18,877
with MuleSoft API solutions, deployment
time was cut down into just 58 days.

309
00:18:18,957 --> 00:18:21,137
A 68 percent improvement will happen here.

310
00:18:21,827 --> 00:18:25,457
this allowed new hospitals, clinics,
and digital services to go live

311
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:29,057
with much faster, reducing the
bottlenecks in IT implementation.

312
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:30,947
So why does this matter?

313
00:18:31,257 --> 00:18:34,327
Hospitals adopting new technology
can't offer long delays.

314
00:18:34,857 --> 00:18:38,247
Faster integration means doctors
and nurses can start using new

315
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:41,677
digital tools soon and ultimately
the benefits to patient's care.

316
00:18:42,177 --> 00:18:47,097
And by optimizing workflows and
automating data exchange between

317
00:18:47,537 --> 00:18:51,367
hospitals, labs, pharmacies, and
insurance providers, the network served 9.

318
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:53,057
5 million annually.

319
00:18:53,587 --> 00:18:57,667
So manual data entry was reduced in
processes like insurance verification,

320
00:18:57,707 --> 00:19:01,847
patient records access, and
prescription fulfillment were automated.

321
00:19:02,397 --> 00:19:06,107
Redundant IT maintenance cons were
eliminated, making decisions much

322
00:19:06,137 --> 00:19:07,657
more cost efficient will happen.

323
00:19:08,317 --> 00:19:14,402
And, within 18 months, the healthcare
network achieved a 182% written

324
00:19:14,402 --> 00:19:17,722
on investment, one of the fastest
and highest in the industry.

325
00:19:18,342 --> 00:19:23,742
See the cost of implementing MuleSoft API
was fully recovered with the first year.

326
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:28,132
The success set to a benchmark for
other healthcare organization looking to

327
00:19:28,142 --> 00:19:31,862
modernize the systems without compiling,
replacing existing infrastructure.

328
00:19:32,532 --> 00:19:33,652
So why does this matter?

329
00:19:33,742 --> 00:19:37,420
So many healthcare organizations
hesitate to invest a new technology

330
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,142
due to budget constraints, but
this case study proves that API

331
00:19:41,142 --> 00:19:45,552
integration is not It's an investment
with fast and, miserable returns.

332
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:50,172
So, this case study proves
that APLA connectivity is

333
00:19:50,192 --> 00:19:51,712
more than just an IT upgrade.

334
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:55,262
It's just a fundamental shift
in how healthcare operates.

335
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:59,612
hospitals can integrate new systems
nearly 70 percent faster, making sure

336
00:19:59,752 --> 00:20:05,652
they stay ahead in digital transformation
and Massive card saving allow for better,

337
00:20:05,852 --> 00:20:10,702
resource allocation, improving all our
patient care, the ROI speak for itself.

338
00:20:10,702 --> 00:20:14,992
So modernizing healthcare IT
infrastructure is not just beneficial is.

339
00:20:15,552 --> 00:20:18,102
Essential for long term sustainability.

340
00:20:18,662 --> 00:20:21,912
MuleSoft don't just improve
this healthcare network.

341
00:20:21,952 --> 00:20:25,782
It's just set the stage of
smarter, faster, and more

342
00:20:25,782 --> 00:20:27,522
connected future for healthcare.

343
00:20:28,432 --> 00:20:30,292
Okay, let's move on to other slide.

344
00:20:30,792 --> 00:20:32,852
Okay, let's talk about diagnosis.

345
00:20:33,377 --> 00:20:38,337
So now let's see how seen API
integration transform system efficiency.

346
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:43,237
Now let's drive deeper into how
improved diagnostics, one of the

347
00:20:43,237 --> 00:20:45,287
most crucial areas in healthcare.

348
00:20:46,217 --> 00:20:48,207
How MuleSoft integration platform is.

349
00:20:48,777 --> 00:20:53,297
ensuring precision speed up results
and improving the patient's safety.

350
00:20:54,257 --> 00:20:58,137
So let's discuss about
accuracy enhancement.

351
00:20:58,487 --> 00:21:06,192
So 48 percent of boost in diagnostic
precision and preventing over 52, 000,

352
00:21:06,262 --> 00:21:09,682
15, 200 potential medical errors annually.

353
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:15,532
So this improvement has directly
contributed to better patient safety

354
00:21:15,532 --> 00:21:20,302
outcomes, reducing misdiagnosis
and unnecessary treatments.

355
00:21:20,302 --> 00:21:21,652
So why does this matter?

356
00:21:21,682 --> 00:21:26,572
Diagnosis lead to delight on
incorrect treatments, sometimes

357
00:21:26,602 --> 00:21:30,616
with life threatening consequences
with improved diagnosis.

358
00:21:30,716 --> 00:21:35,996
Accuracy patients get the right
treatment faster and improve the survivor

359
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,336
rates at long time health outcomes.

360
00:21:38,836 --> 00:21:39,716
processing speed.

361
00:21:40,036 --> 00:21:42,696
So from 52 hours to just 5.

362
00:21:42,696 --> 00:21:42,936
8 hours.

363
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:47,836
So before implementing use of solution,
diagnostics confirmation time took up

364
00:21:47,836 --> 00:21:51,206
to 52 hours more than a. two full days.

365
00:21:51,206 --> 00:21:51,606
I think.

366
00:21:52,046 --> 00:21:55,296
No, this same diagnosis
are confirmed in just 5.

367
00:21:55,296 --> 00:21:58,906
8 hours at an 89 percent
improvement happened.

368
00:21:59,436 --> 00:22:01,296
So what does this matter?

369
00:22:01,296 --> 00:22:04,146
So faster diagnosis means
for the treatment decisions.

370
00:22:04,186 --> 00:22:09,396
A patient in emergency room does
how, days to wait for test results.

371
00:22:09,406 --> 00:22:13,266
Getting a accurate diagnosis with
hours or even minutes can be life

372
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:16,696
saving and imagining analysis.

373
00:22:16,706 --> 00:22:19,761
So a I. diagnostic imaging process.

374
00:22:19,761 --> 00:22:23,701
1. 2 million medical
imaging images per month.

375
00:22:24,201 --> 00:22:24,551
So 99.

376
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:31,951
85 accuracy rate, meaning few misdiagnosis
and more confidence in imaging results.

377
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:36,891
So false results have been reduced
by 62 percent and make sure that

378
00:22:36,891 --> 00:22:41,051
patients aren't subjected to
unnecessary test treatments or stress.

379
00:22:41,471 --> 00:22:42,641
So why does it matter with?

380
00:22:42,931 --> 00:22:49,321
Traditional imaging errors or delays
in reading scans can lead to missed

381
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:55,091
tumors, undiagnosed fractures, or delayed
detection of life threatening conditions.

382
00:22:55,591 --> 00:23:01,121
AI powered Imaginary makes
sure every detail is captured

383
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:03,356
with very Perfect accuracy.

384
00:23:03,856 --> 00:23:09,316
So 71 percent of reduction in
diagnostics done around time for

385
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:15,166
critical cases, enabling rapid
interventions when every second.

386
00:23:15,676 --> 00:23:17,946
So in conditions like strokes.

387
00:23:18,376 --> 00:23:19,186
Heart attacks.

388
00:23:19,246 --> 00:23:22,986
Every minute of delay increased the
risk of complications out there.

389
00:23:23,366 --> 00:23:27,826
So with faster diagnostics, doctors can
immediately start life saving treatment

390
00:23:27,826 --> 00:23:29,416
instead of waiting for lab results.

391
00:23:29,856 --> 00:23:34,576
So doctors have access to
more precise real time data.

392
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:40,596
Patients have received a diagnosis faster,
leading to early treatments and AI power.

393
00:23:40,676 --> 00:23:44,236
Imagine they just the false
treatments to improve the confidence

394
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:47,626
in results and critical conditions
are identified sooner, giving

395
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,786
patients a better chance of survival.

396
00:23:50,436 --> 00:23:54,966
So this isn't just an idea, but it's
revolution in diagnostics, making

397
00:23:55,356 --> 00:23:57,466
better outcomes of millions of patients.

398
00:23:58,401 --> 00:23:59,861
So let's move on to other slide.

399
00:24:00,361 --> 00:24:04,831
so far we have talked about how API
integration has improved the diagnostics,

400
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:07,281
treatment, accuracy and patient care.

401
00:24:07,621 --> 00:24:13,491
But another major benefit is how
it enhances, efficiently, reducing

402
00:24:13,491 --> 00:24:14,901
cost and improves the system.

403
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:15,776
Scalability.

404
00:24:16,086 --> 00:24:20,856
So healthcare organizations deals with
millions of patients request daily and

405
00:24:20,856 --> 00:24:23,736
it access that data is slow or efficient.

406
00:24:24,086 --> 00:24:25,946
It directly impacts patient outcomes.

407
00:24:25,946 --> 00:24:31,936
So new soft API let integration has
transformed how hospitals manage

408
00:24:31,966 --> 00:24:36,576
patient records, cut development costs
and built a scalable infrastructure

409
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:37,816
that is ready for the future.

410
00:24:38,786 --> 00:24:42,651
So let's look at three key
Improvements in this area.

411
00:24:42,921 --> 00:24:44,921
So record access improvement.

412
00:24:45,711 --> 00:24:51,481
So healthcare provider no access patient
records in just 28 seconds down for 5.

413
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:54,511
5 percent improvement here.

414
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:59,151
So this enables faster emergency
response, better decision making

415
00:24:59,161 --> 00:25:01,051
and reduce wait times for patients.

416
00:25:01,051 --> 00:25:01,501
The system no process 1.

417
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:04,061
2 million.

418
00:25:04,561 --> 00:25:08,551
Patient records request party with 99.

419
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:14,831
995 percent accuracy, make sure in, real
and, secure access critical information.

420
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,151
So why does this matter?

421
00:25:17,191 --> 00:25:21,531
So in an emergency room setting,
waiting every five minutes of

422
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:23,101
patient record could mean delight.

423
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:23,711
treatment.

424
00:25:24,001 --> 00:25:29,001
So which instant access doctors can make
life saving decision faster, improving the

425
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:31,151
survivors and reducing the complications.

426
00:25:31,661 --> 00:25:34,181
So second is development cost reduction.

427
00:25:35,141 --> 00:25:36,051
So 14.

428
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:41,661
2 million in annual saving through
strategic system optimization and 58

429
00:25:41,701 --> 00:25:46,681
percent reduction in development cost,
which eliminates unnecessary technical

430
00:25:46,691 --> 00:25:51,531
depths created a more maintainable
future proof infrastructure that

431
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:54,051
benefit both providers and patients.

432
00:25:54,491 --> 00:25:56,121
So why does this matter?

433
00:25:56,201 --> 00:26:01,621
So many healthcare systems spends
millions of dollars maintaining outdated

434
00:26:01,781 --> 00:26:08,381
IT structure by maintaining MuleSoft API
organization can eliminate efficiency,

435
00:26:08,521 --> 00:26:12,861
reduce IT cost and, reinvest savings
into patient care and innovations.

436
00:26:13,811 --> 00:26:16,021
the other one is
maintenance and scalability.

437
00:26:16,101 --> 00:26:18,701
That is for future proof,
proofing healthcare systems.

438
00:26:18,721 --> 00:26:23,511
So 72 percent of decrease in
system maintenance costs, reduce

439
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:27,671
the operational expenses, while
maintaining high system performances.

440
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:32,911
So 78 percent increase in system
scalability allows, hospital to

441
00:26:32,911 --> 00:26:38,141
support more patient, integrate, new
technology and spend service without

442
00:26:38,141 --> 00:26:40,391
medical infrastructure, limitations.

443
00:26:40,971 --> 00:26:45,131
So this makes sure seamless HIPAA
compliance across all access

444
00:26:45,131 --> 00:26:48,611
points, keeping patients data secure
without slowing down the workflows.

445
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:50,321
So why does this matter?

446
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:54,061
So as healthcare system continues
to grow and handle large amounts of.

447
00:26:54,256 --> 00:26:54,546
data.

448
00:26:54,576 --> 00:26:58,136
They need scalable, efficient
and secure solutions.

449
00:26:58,656 --> 00:27:02,246
So this transformation makes
health care provider can expand

450
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:05,696
innovative and improve patient
experience without worrying about I.

451
00:27:05,696 --> 00:27:06,716
T. Limitations.

452
00:27:07,366 --> 00:27:10,456
So why this matters for
future of health care?

453
00:27:10,736 --> 00:27:16,016
So doctors and nurses get patient
recover faster, enabling Care and more

454
00:27:16,016 --> 00:27:21,136
informed treatment decisions and hospital
save, millions in it costs, allowing

455
00:27:21,136 --> 00:27:25,156
them to allocate more resources to
patient care and advanced technologies.

456
00:27:25,636 --> 00:27:27,646
So a scalable infrastructure may.

457
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:31,636
Sure healthcare organizations are ready
for future innovations, say driven

458
00:27:31,636 --> 00:27:34,666
healthcare and, expanded patients needs.

459
00:27:35,436 --> 00:27:39,156
this isn't just a short term improvement,
it's a long-term transformation,

460
00:27:39,156 --> 00:27:42,996
creating a faster and more efficient
and future-proof healthcare systems.

461
00:27:43,901 --> 00:27:46,671
So let's just work on other slide.

462
00:27:47,171 --> 00:27:51,141
okay, as a healthcare organization,
expand the digital capabilities,

463
00:27:51,141 --> 00:27:55,081
security and compliance,
become more critical than ever.

464
00:27:55,461 --> 00:27:59,711
So patient data is among the most
sensitive information in the world.

465
00:28:00,631 --> 00:28:06,181
And a single data breach can lead
to financial penalties and legal

466
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:08,111
consequences and loss of patient trust.

467
00:28:08,531 --> 00:28:14,021
So that's why MuleSoft APL8 integration
is built in enterprise grade security

468
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:19,321
and strict compliance measures and making
sure the data is protected, monitored,

469
00:28:19,321 --> 00:28:21,561
and accessible only by the right people.

470
00:28:21,671 --> 00:28:26,476
So let's explore a five key security
pillars that make it possible.

471
00:28:26,696 --> 00:28:28,386
So first one is end to end encryption.

472
00:28:28,386 --> 00:28:36,406
So MUSEF secures patient's data with
military grade encryption, providing 99.

473
00:28:36,646 --> 00:28:39,116
9995 percent protection effectiveness.

474
00:28:39,236 --> 00:28:43,786
So it handles 4.

475
00:28:43,786 --> 00:28:45,993
8 million sensitive transactions
daily, ensuring patient records

476
00:28:45,993 --> 00:28:47,096
remain private and secure.

477
00:28:47,176 --> 00:28:48,546
So why does this matter?

478
00:28:48,576 --> 00:28:55,691
So encryption makes sure that even
if data is intercepted, it Remains

479
00:28:55,741 --> 00:28:57,811
unreadable to unauthorized user.

480
00:28:58,351 --> 00:29:02,511
So this level of security meets and
exists healthcare industry standard

481
00:29:02,511 --> 00:29:07,151
protection, patient confidentiality,
and data governance coming to data

482
00:29:07,191 --> 00:29:11,651
government's 91 percent of improvement
in data quality metrics, reducing errors

483
00:29:11,691 --> 00:29:13,821
and inconsistency in medical records.

484
00:29:14,331 --> 00:29:20,661
So 76 percent of reduction data handling
violations ensures, hospitals compiles

485
00:29:20,691 --> 00:29:23,081
with strict data protection policies.

486
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:24,521
Why does this matter?

487
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:27,931
Clean, accurate data is
essential for patient safety.

488
00:29:28,421 --> 00:29:33,621
Error in medical records can lead to
misdiagnosis or incorrect treatments.

489
00:29:33,641 --> 00:29:34,011
Controls.

490
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:35,631
preventing breaches.

491
00:29:35,681 --> 00:29:42,731
14, 200 role based access
permissions per organization.

492
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:44,911
Make sure only unauthorized personnel can.

493
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,306
Access specific data.

494
00:29:46,726 --> 00:29:50,816
So 80, 82 percent decrease in
security breaches caused by

495
00:29:50,846 --> 00:29:52,586
unauthorized access attempts.

496
00:29:52,896 --> 00:29:54,486
So why does this matter?

497
00:29:54,756 --> 00:29:58,816
So not even hospital employees should
have access to all patient records.

498
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:00,346
So MuleSERP.

499
00:30:00,606 --> 00:30:05,356
enforces strict role based control
to prevent unauthorized access.

500
00:30:05,976 --> 00:30:10,736
So this makes sure that one doctor,
nurse, and unauthorized staff can

501
00:30:10,736 --> 00:30:12,546
see the information they need.

502
00:30:12,716 --> 00:30:14,246
Nothing more, nothing less.

503
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:15,866
And audit log.

504
00:30:15,986 --> 00:30:18,856
So AI powered threat
detecting and monitoring.

505
00:30:18,996 --> 00:30:19,491
We can.

506
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,461
Think about in this case.

507
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:22,421
