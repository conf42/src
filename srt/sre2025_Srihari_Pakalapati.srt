1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,190
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:04,550
Thank you for joining me today
for this critical discussion on

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,340
ransomware readiness, backup,
and recovery in the cloud.

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,410
My name is Sharri pti and I'm a principal
cloud and security architect currently

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,880
working for Trade and Track two, with
over 15 years of uni experience across

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,880
cloud, security, engineering, DevSecOps,
and cloud solutions architecture.

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,009
And then coming to this.

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,110
What is ransomware?

9
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:32,639
So ransomware refers to a business
model that a wide in a wide range

10
00:00:32,639 --> 00:00:38,609
of associated technologies that
unauthorized users to use to export

11
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:43,379
money from entities, unauthorized
users or system vulnerabilities to

12
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,889
access data and then restrict the
rightful owner from accessing it.

13
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,139
So ransomware encrypts your
data, making it, inaccessible.

14
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:58,230
Until your ransom is paid, attackers
often demand payment in cryptocurrency.

15
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,059
So before we dive in, so
let's start with some context.

16
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,799
Ransom error attacks have
exploded in recent years.

17
00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:10,899
It's hard to turn on the news without
seeing another company getting hit.

18
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:15,089
So according to the Sophos 2024 report.

19
00:01:15,589 --> 00:01:19,369
59% of the organizations
surveyed, they were done.

20
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:24,649
Out of 5,000 organizations were
hit by ransomware in the past year.

21
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:27,759
That's just the attacks
that were reported.

22
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,479
Many incidents go unreported due to
various reasons, like brand reputation,

23
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,964
stock price impact, various other reasons.

24
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:43,364
So if you look at the report,
94% of victim, victims said

25
00:01:44,024 --> 00:01:46,034
attackers targeted their backups.

26
00:01:46,544 --> 00:01:50,339
So that means it's, you're just
not, that the attackers are

27
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:56,069
targeting for your primary data,
but also the backup infrastructure.

28
00:01:56,069 --> 00:02:02,333
So 32% of the victims whose data
was encrypted also had data stolen.

29
00:02:02,753 --> 00:02:03,653
So that means.

30
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:10,523
They, once your backups are compromised
or your data is compromised, they

31
00:02:10,523 --> 00:02:16,653
will extract the data exfiltration
of data so that they can host

32
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:18,453
you as hostage for the data.

33
00:02:18,704 --> 00:02:24,014
And then the attacks, 70% of
attacks result in data encryption.

34
00:02:24,674 --> 00:02:30,074
So that means once they accelerated the
data out of the organization or network.

35
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:31,979
They encrypt the data.

36
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:38,029
And after that, so organizations
whose attacks began with exploitation

37
00:02:38,029 --> 00:02:42,648
of unpatched vulnerability report
considerably more severe outcomes

38
00:02:42,648 --> 00:02:46,999
than those were with the attacks
started with compromise credentials.

39
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:52,328
So based on these statistics, the
average initial ransom demand that

40
00:02:52,328 --> 00:02:54,928
was being demanded is $2 million.

41
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:59,909
And then 98% of the organizations
that were attacked were

42
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:02,388
recovered their encrypted data.

43
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:06,828
So either by paying the
ransom or from those backups.

44
00:03:07,578 --> 00:03:13,279
But lately the trend is slowly started
shifting towards the restoration is

45
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:16,489
happening from the backups that they have.

46
00:03:16,678 --> 00:03:17,428
Which is a good sign.

47
00:03:17,928 --> 00:03:19,273
And then the next one is.

48
00:03:19,773 --> 00:03:20,523
The recovery.

49
00:03:20,643 --> 00:03:24,934
So the average recovery
cost is $2.7 million.

50
00:03:25,113 --> 00:03:30,563
So we excluding ransom payment,
so 30% of these organizations

51
00:03:30,563 --> 00:03:32,873
had more than a month to recover.

52
00:03:32,903 --> 00:03:38,063
So that means once they're compromised,
it's either due to lack of backups

53
00:03:38,153 --> 00:03:41,603
or lack of readiness or playbooks.

54
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:43,433
There's no proper incident management.

55
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:46,433
So all these due to these factors.

56
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:50,769
It can take more than a month
to recover from those incidents.

57
00:03:50,858 --> 00:03:55,478
That means once your applications are
down or your organization applications

58
00:03:55,478 --> 00:03:58,928
are down, it can take 30 days to recover.

59
00:03:58,988 --> 00:03:59,709
That's a lot.

60
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:02,829
In some scenarios, it can go beyond that.

61
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:08,519
Today's object two is straightforward
but crucial to ensure you understand

62
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,298
the critical nature of disaster
recovery planning in the context

63
00:04:12,298 --> 00:04:13,978
of modern ransomware threats.

64
00:04:14,323 --> 00:04:19,243
We will explore cutting edge backup
strategies, bat battle tested

65
00:04:19,243 --> 00:04:23,804
techniques, zero trust architectures,
and automated recovery workflows,

66
00:04:24,253 --> 00:04:28,664
transforming your backup infrastructure
from your potential liability into

67
00:04:28,664 --> 00:04:30,674
your strongest security asset.

68
00:04:31,174 --> 00:04:34,054
So let's take a look at
the ransomware landscape.

69
00:04:34,554 --> 00:04:37,103
Ransomware is not a static problem.

70
00:04:37,253 --> 00:04:40,073
The ransomware landscape
is constantly evolving.

71
00:04:40,554 --> 00:04:45,713
You are playing chess with thinking humans
on the other side who can quickly adapt.

72
00:04:46,193 --> 00:04:51,203
Just in the last year, we have seen
threat actors significantly evolve

73
00:04:51,234 --> 00:04:56,723
their tools, techniques and procedures
like ransomware as a service, including

74
00:04:56,753 --> 00:04:59,153
AI based sophisticated techniques.

75
00:04:59,993 --> 00:05:04,253
For example, we have witnessed the rise
of intermittent encryption, so which

76
00:05:04,253 --> 00:05:10,373
speeds of the encryption process and
awais the detection ransomware operations

77
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:15,593
have become almost industrialized
with the different specialized groups

78
00:05:15,593 --> 00:05:17,453
handling different parts of the attack.

79
00:05:17,723 --> 00:05:22,603
From initial incursion to negotiation
specialists, reactor objectives

80
00:05:22,603 --> 00:05:24,103
are expanding beyond money.

81
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:28,123
So some groups are now taking
sides in geopolitical conflicts.

82
00:05:28,948 --> 00:05:32,068
Meanwhile, cyber insurance
is falling short.

83
00:05:32,638 --> 00:05:38,008
Major global underwriters are reducing
or re refusing ransomware coverage,

84
00:05:38,609 --> 00:05:40,948
adding sublimates to policies.

85
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:45,568
And we have seen cases where
payouts were denied, but classifying

86
00:05:45,628 --> 00:05:47,908
ransomware as an act of war.

87
00:05:48,408 --> 00:05:49,848
And attackers.

88
00:05:50,793 --> 00:05:54,454
Usually gain that attack
pattern is established and

89
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,344
repeating across ordinations.

90
00:05:57,214 --> 00:06:01,383
So usually it happens like event
of chain a chain of events.

91
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:07,174
So attackers gain initial access through
infection vectors, including like

92
00:06:07,179 --> 00:06:14,044
phishing mls in malicious attachments,
drive by downloads, vulnerabilities

93
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,813
in remote access protocols.

94
00:06:16,278 --> 00:06:20,538
Exploited vulnerabilities both
in operating systems or in

95
00:06:20,568 --> 00:06:22,368
framework language frameworks.

96
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:27,618
So compromise credentials, flawed
public facing applications, something

97
00:06:27,618 --> 00:06:30,558
like S3 or weak authentication setup.

98
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:36,278
So from there they can get
into your infrastructure, cloud

99
00:06:36,278 --> 00:06:37,928
infrastructure, and cloud storage.

100
00:06:38,468 --> 00:06:40,268
So they do the discovery actions.

101
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:46,538
Then they can go to the next state
of events like a data destruction,

102
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:48,968
data exfiltration, data encryption.

103
00:06:49,628 --> 00:06:51,908
So these can impact a lot of ways.

104
00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:54,818
So they establish a persistence.

105
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,338
They move laterally
throughout the network.

106
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:00,668
They exfiltrate data before encrypting it.

107
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:03,458
They deploy encryption and demand ransom.

108
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:09,869
So sometimes in usual cases, some of
these organizations, the attackers were

109
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:16,078
so persistent that they can stay there
for months, like two to three months.

110
00:07:16,528 --> 00:07:20,278
They will do the slowly
it, these operations in the

111
00:07:20,278 --> 00:07:22,378
backend without any detection.

112
00:07:23,188 --> 00:07:27,748
So once they hold all the footprint
what they want, that's when

113
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:30,088
they'll start encryption process.

114
00:07:30,388 --> 00:07:34,018
And here is what the particularly
concerning in most organizations

115
00:07:34,109 --> 00:07:38,938
making, it's much easier to block
inbound traffic than outbound traffic.

116
00:07:39,148 --> 00:07:44,458
So making data exfiltration a significant
risk because the, before they do the

117
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:50,278
encryption, usually they try to exfiltrate
your data so that they'll try to demand

118
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,489
or they'll try to do the extortion.

119
00:07:53,989 --> 00:07:58,609
They'll try to do the extortion
demand sim telling the sensitive

120
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:01,219
data to expose it public.

121
00:08:01,518 --> 00:08:06,058
And that's what like the, those are like
the chain of events that it can happen.

122
00:08:06,358 --> 00:08:11,278
So coming to attack scenarios, attack
scenarios are a little bit different,

123
00:08:11,278 --> 00:08:15,428
like the same little bit on similar
way that what we just talked about.

124
00:08:15,938 --> 00:08:17,648
So like data encryption.

125
00:08:17,738 --> 00:08:22,478
So usually attackers log down
critical data and files making it

126
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:25,228
inaccessible, and then system disruption.

127
00:08:25,228 --> 00:08:29,218
So they try to halt your, all your
systems, like operational systems

128
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:33,118
or rendered unusable, disrupt
critical systems and services.

129
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:36,988
So that means you cannot operate
anything inside your organization.

130
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:42,138
Related to infra infrastructure,
IT infrastructure DA acceleration

131
00:08:42,468 --> 00:08:45,378
is a sensitive data is
stolen before encryption.

132
00:08:45,378 --> 00:08:52,459
So they try to have this data before
encryption so that they can demand

133
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:58,674
ransom payments or threats saying
that this will be released to public.

134
00:08:59,174 --> 00:09:01,364
And then the next one is
the extortion demands.

135
00:09:01,394 --> 00:09:05,084
So they demand ransom payments to
restore access with threats or public

136
00:09:05,084 --> 00:09:09,594
data leaks, like you pay the ransom
through the crypto cryptocurrency.

137
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:12,684
Then they'll ask, they'll
tell you to give the key.

138
00:09:13,194 --> 00:09:16,104
They'll promise you that,
it never goes that way.

139
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,554
So the common fit Pauls.

140
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:25,999
In ransomware response is when an attack
happens, organizations often make critical

141
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,369
mistakes that compound the damage.

142
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:32,109
So these areas are little bit wider here.

143
00:09:32,229 --> 00:09:35,319
So there are inadequate
crisis communications.

144
00:09:35,319 --> 00:09:40,239
So that means too often organizations
lack a clear crisis communication plan.

145
00:09:40,739 --> 00:09:42,119
In the midst of an attack.

146
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:46,194
You need to know exactly who's involved
and who takes ga specific actions.

147
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,279
Accounting to a P WC study.

148
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,599
Pricewater Cooper study.

149
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:55,879
69% of our nation that
successfully navigated a ransomware

150
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:59,539
attack had a documented and
practiced communication plans.

151
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:05,989
So having that practice and documentation
will really help you when in need.

152
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:06,969
And there is.

153
00:10:06,969 --> 00:10:09,699
The other one is insufficient
logging and monitoring.

154
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:13,419
So usually security teams depend on these.

155
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:17,709
They need access to logs to build
an incident response timelines.

156
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:22,569
That's how they know when the
attacker enter into the network or

157
00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:24,849
when the data has been compromised.

158
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:30,039
But many organizations discovered too
late that their logging was inadequate.

159
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:35,364
So research reports found that
organizations with proper security

160
00:10:35,364 --> 00:10:41,904
monitoring detected breaches 74 days
faster on average than those without.

161
00:10:42,404 --> 00:10:45,794
And the next one is unprepared
for ransom decisions.

162
00:10:45,974 --> 00:10:49,454
So many crucial questions arise
when there is a incident happened.

163
00:10:50,264 --> 00:10:52,274
Who can authorize a ransom payment?

164
00:10:52,394 --> 00:10:54,674
Has your board approved such payments?

165
00:10:54,734 --> 00:10:56,834
Do you have cryptocurrency available?

166
00:10:57,374 --> 00:10:59,114
Are there legal implications?

167
00:10:59,714 --> 00:11:03,824
The user, US Treasury Department,
has sanctioned several ransomware

168
00:11:03,824 --> 00:11:09,974
groups, making payments to them
potentially illegal, so making this

169
00:11:09,974 --> 00:11:14,674
option completely off the table and
then underestimating recovery times.

170
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:20,719
So most of these organizations often
assume recovery will be quick, but

171
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:26,039
I. But the co but comprehensive
incident response takes a lot of time,

172
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:28,169
sometimes without any preparations.

173
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:32,759
So IBM's cost of data breach
report indicates that the

174
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:38,009
average time to identify and
contain a breach is 2 77 days.

175
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,239
That's over nine months.

176
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:44,689
So that's, those are like the common
pitfalls in ransomware response.

177
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:47,959
So without that proper response,
you will be doomed when there

178
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:49,909
is a real incident happens.

179
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:56,009
And then there are back of failures
happens because this is perhaps

180
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,809
the most devastating pitfall.

181
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:02,879
So many organizations discover
too late that their backups are

182
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:04,649
either compromised or encrypted.

183
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:12,169
Incomplete or too or doted to be useful,
inaccessible when needed, most unable

184
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:14,179
to be restored in a timely manner.

185
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:20,199
So here the key takeaway, it's not
if, but when ordination should be

186
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:22,239
ready for ransomware situations.

187
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:26,669
So how do you do this recovery
planning and the recovery planning

188
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:28,259
considerations or strategy?

189
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:34,019
The When planning your recovery
strategy, four key factors will

190
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,629
impact both effectiveness and cost.

191
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:38,369
So one is scope.

192
00:12:38,869 --> 00:12:43,989
This tells you how much data needs
protection, and then our people,

193
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,879
so recovery point object you.

194
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:49,659
How much data can you
offer to recreate or lose?

195
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:53,549
And the third one is r table
recovery time objective.

196
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:55,109
So how quickly.

197
00:12:55,454 --> 00:12:56,684
Must you recover?

198
00:12:56,894 --> 00:12:58,574
What is the cost of downtime?

199
00:12:59,074 --> 00:13:00,603
And then the last one is copies.

200
00:13:00,664 --> 00:13:03,124
So how many backup copies
do you need to maintain?

201
00:13:03,624 --> 00:13:08,574
So different workloads will have different
requirements, and then these things

202
00:13:08,574 --> 00:13:13,674
can be derived if you, in order to do
the recovery strategy or you want to

203
00:13:13,674 --> 00:13:15,834
do the optimize that recovery strategy.

204
00:13:16,334 --> 00:13:19,454
The critical thing that you need
to do is the data classification.

205
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:23,834
You need to have, you need to make sure
you have your organization has a data

206
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:26,084
classification already done or defined.

207
00:13:26,584 --> 00:13:32,084
Take a step back one step back
to like I did mention RPO and

208
00:13:32,084 --> 00:13:34,274
RTO as part of the strategy.

209
00:13:34,774 --> 00:13:39,934
These are critical in defining what kind
of strategy that you want to design.

210
00:13:40,234 --> 00:13:43,114
And to do that, you need to define these.

211
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:47,869
And you will define based
on the data classification.

212
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:54,559
So when it comes to RPO and RT O, how
much data can you afford to recreate

213
00:13:54,559 --> 00:14:02,089
or lose when a disaster happens, like
of the disaster happen couple of days

214
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:08,119
back, can you withstand these two days
downtime or two days loss of data?

215
00:14:08,619 --> 00:14:09,489
That's called RPO.

216
00:14:09,989 --> 00:14:13,169
Then the other one is how
quickly must you recover?

217
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,848
What is the cost of downtime?

218
00:14:15,598 --> 00:14:20,319
That means how long you can
offer to lose your downtime.

219
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:24,899
So that means your own application is
down, like how long you can offer that.

220
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:27,119
So you are, you can you offer one hour?

221
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:29,519
You can, you have eight
hours, can you 10 hours.

222
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,049
So that's our table.

223
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:32,019
And then.

224
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,559
Coming back to the data classification.

225
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:40,498
So that's a critical thing in
order to discover your R-P-O-R-T-O

226
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:42,809
or the scope or the copies.

227
00:14:43,468 --> 00:14:46,738
So how do you decide the criticality?

228
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:50,309
So if you look at here, you need
to understand what type of data

229
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:55,319
you have and who owns it, and if
it is critical for your business.

230
00:14:55,819 --> 00:14:57,589
What does actually critical means?

231
00:14:57,769 --> 00:14:59,479
So does it impact your customer?

232
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:01,609
Does it impact your cus business revenue?

233
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:05,239
So how do you determine your, the
criticality of data criticality

234
00:15:05,299 --> 00:15:06,349
or data classification?

235
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:09,529
So you do this by simple flow chart here.

236
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:15,229
So you can define is your data
operation so operational, that means

237
00:15:15,229 --> 00:15:18,209
your data is being, operated or not.

238
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:23,309
So that means you have, assuming
your data is completely lost.

239
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:25,019
So what do you do?

240
00:15:25,138 --> 00:15:30,388
So if the business was to move forward
without the data, or would there be

241
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:36,018
an impact, if there will be an impact,
that means can the data be recreated?

242
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:41,108
If you cannot recreate, that means that
is your critical, true, critical data,

243
00:15:41,258 --> 00:15:43,708
and then you should go for a backup plan.

244
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:47,028
If the data is not that
it can be recreated.

245
00:15:47,508 --> 00:15:51,348
So that means it takes how long
it'll take to recreate the data.

246
00:15:52,068 --> 00:15:54,018
Can it take in minutes or hours?

247
00:15:54,228 --> 00:15:59,688
So based on that new further
guidance is required, and if the

248
00:15:59,988 --> 00:16:02,448
data where there would be impact.

249
00:16:02,658 --> 00:16:05,298
If there is no impact, then
it is not a critical data.

250
00:16:05,418 --> 00:16:09,468
So that's how you simply follow
the chart and determine what

251
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,578
kind of critical data that.

252
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:11,738
You have.

253
00:16:11,978 --> 00:16:13,538
So first you need to know your data.

254
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:18,688
And then there's a different payer
and different RP and RP RTOs defined

255
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:22,708
for each of these kind of bus de,
depending on their data classification.

256
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:28,908
Generally the Michigan mission critical
systems, these are like re required true

257
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:34,068
disaster recovery solutions, typically
highest cost here, like example payment

258
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:36,048
processing, critical infrastructure.

259
00:16:36,418 --> 00:16:40,378
Which typically they have RP and
RTO within less than 10 minutes.

260
00:16:40,678 --> 00:16:44,518
So that means without these systems
you'll be losing a lot of money.

261
00:16:45,018 --> 00:16:47,298
And the next one is
business critical systems.

262
00:16:47,418 --> 00:16:51,728
These are like required for these require
robust disaster recovery solutions.

263
00:16:52,568 --> 00:16:58,148
Examples like ERP systems or customer
facing applications, and generally

264
00:16:58,148 --> 00:17:00,968
these RPOR tvOS for these type of.

265
00:17:01,568 --> 00:17:05,238
Business critical systems is
around less than one hour.

266
00:17:05,738 --> 00:17:09,008
And the next kind of hitting is
business Operational systems like

267
00:17:09,068 --> 00:17:12,368
these are, like, can we often
use standard backup solutions?

268
00:17:12,788 --> 00:17:17,078
The RPO and RT O is like less than eight
hours, like examples, like internal

269
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,628
collaboration tools, reporting systems.

270
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,618
So even if they are down, that's
the impact is not much for any

271
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:25,238
customer or revenue generation.

272
00:17:26,123 --> 00:17:28,613
And the last but not least,
is administrative systems.

273
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:29,663
These are like standard.

274
00:17:29,713 --> 00:17:33,563
You can go for standard backup
solutions that are sufficient like

275
00:17:33,563 --> 00:17:37,763
exams and HR systems or documentation
repositories, something like that.

276
00:17:38,393 --> 00:17:42,293
So these typically the RQR and
RQO fall in 24 to 48 hours.

277
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:48,143
So depending on these that you define
RT o at RPU and the data classification

278
00:17:48,143 --> 00:17:53,763
and critical systems, you can design
your, strategy against your resilience.

279
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:56,113
So how resilient you want to test set up.

280
00:17:56,323 --> 00:18:00,433
So if you take this one, this
slide gives you three scenarios.

281
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:04,748
Like one is a backup scenario, how much
it costs, and what are the RT word and

282
00:18:04,788 --> 00:18:07,363
RPO, and then the disaster recovery.

283
00:18:07,423 --> 00:18:09,428
So what are the typical RP and RT was?

284
00:18:09,928 --> 00:18:12,538
Remember that every minute
of downtime costs money.

285
00:18:12,598 --> 00:18:18,898
So according to Gartner, the average
cost of it downtime is $5,600 per minute.

286
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:24,508
So which extrapolates to over
300,000, 300,000 per hour.

287
00:18:25,008 --> 00:18:28,398
This will help you determine what
kind of application or what kind

288
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:32,658
of data that you have and what kind
of strategy that you want to build.

289
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:37,188
Resilience strategy like we, whether
you want to go for backups with RP and

290
00:18:37,188 --> 00:18:41,718
RTO within hours, or you want to go
with the disaster recovery, which has

291
00:18:41,718 --> 00:18:44,148
RPO and RTO within seconds and minutes.

292
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:48,693
Or you can go for R-P-Y-R-T-O
in real time, near real time,

293
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:49,773
literal, within seconds.

294
00:18:49,773 --> 00:18:52,173
Like basically this is
a high availability.

295
00:18:52,803 --> 00:18:58,133
So this is this high availability
is designed in the phase of

296
00:18:58,193 --> 00:19:00,713
architecture, operational mechanisms.

297
00:19:00,893 --> 00:19:02,723
That's when you design these things.

298
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,623
Obviously the cost association
will be something respect to

299
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,033
the, each of these strategies.

300
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:11,713
Then coming to the next part
which is my favorite thing.

301
00:19:11,773 --> 00:19:16,093
So let's talk about a functional
element of ransomware readiness.

302
00:19:16,303 --> 00:19:19,803
So the 3 2 1 1 0 backup tool.

303
00:19:20,313 --> 00:19:24,483
This is an evolution of the
traditional 3, 2, 1 backup strategy.

304
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:30,813
So design specifically to enhance data
production, again, as modern threats

305
00:19:30,813 --> 00:19:33,543
like ransomware, while ensuring reliable.

306
00:19:33,858 --> 00:19:33,888
Recoverability.

307
00:19:34,388 --> 00:19:38,918
So back in the days when I used to
work on the infrastructure, which

308
00:19:38,918 --> 00:19:43,418
is hosted in the on-prem, this used
to be a standard now like 3, 2, 1,

309
00:19:44,288 --> 00:19:46,988
and then now everything is cloud.

310
00:19:47,048 --> 00:19:51,758
Most of our nations moving towards
cloud and it's imperative that a lot

311
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:56,578
of the attacks that are also happening
in the same space now, there's a

312
00:19:56,578 --> 00:19:58,888
need to evolve that traditional.

313
00:19:59,653 --> 00:20:05,413
Rule to customize or adapt for the new
threats, modern threats like ransomware.

314
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,403
So let's go a little bit
more in detail on these.

315
00:20:08,443 --> 00:20:13,993
What is 3 2, 1, 1 0 backup rule is,
so the starting one, three through.

316
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:16,543
So to maintain three copies of your data.

317
00:20:16,828 --> 00:20:20,638
So basically it says you need to maintain
three copies of data, including your

318
00:20:20,638 --> 00:20:25,378
production, so one primary copy, which
is a production, and two backup copies.

319
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:30,478
This ancy ensures that even if
one or two copies are compromised,

320
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:32,278
you will have a reliable backup.

321
00:20:33,268 --> 00:20:34,678
And the next is number two.

322
00:20:35,488 --> 00:20:40,198
Use two different type of storage
media storage store backups on at

323
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:41,878
least two different storage types.

324
00:20:41,968 --> 00:20:45,988
So traditionally it should be
like hard drives, SSDs tapes.

325
00:20:46,258 --> 00:20:49,968
Now with the cloud, you can do
with the cloud storages like block

326
00:20:49,968 --> 00:20:55,098
storage or object storage based
on the Your data classification.

327
00:20:55,098 --> 00:20:58,868
Yeah, in the data tire, this
diversification minimizes the

328
00:20:58,868 --> 00:21:02,258
risk of simultaneous failures due
to hardware or software issues.

329
00:21:03,068 --> 00:21:08,888
The next is one, so keep one copy
offsite, so at least one backup should

330
00:21:08,888 --> 00:21:13,718
be stored in a separate location such
as a remote facility or in the cloud.

331
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:18,848
These products against local
disasters like fires or floods that

332
00:21:18,848 --> 00:21:21,428
could destroy all on premises data.

333
00:21:21,928 --> 00:21:26,458
Or if it is the cloud, then the
clouds does have regions that

334
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:31,138
available to zones they do can hit
with these natural disasters like

335
00:21:31,138 --> 00:21:33,058
fires or floods or earthquakes.

336
00:21:34,018 --> 00:21:35,488
So you need to be prepared for that.

337
00:21:35,988 --> 00:21:40,488
And then the next one is store one
copy offline or make it immutable.

338
00:21:40,788 --> 00:21:42,718
So this part is a new.

339
00:21:43,603 --> 00:21:47,383
In adoption of ransomware
readiness or ransomware production.

340
00:21:47,893 --> 00:21:49,813
So you need to make it I immutable.

341
00:21:49,903 --> 00:21:52,723
So this is crucial for
ransomware production.

342
00:21:53,233 --> 00:21:58,603
So one backup must be either offline,
like a gap, completely disconnected

343
00:21:58,603 --> 00:22:04,123
from networks, making it inaccessible
to ransomware, and then immutable,

344
00:22:04,153 --> 00:22:08,413
so cannot be altered or deleted
even by the administrators adding

345
00:22:08,413 --> 00:22:10,093
an additional layer of security.

346
00:22:10,593 --> 00:22:11,973
The last part is zero.

347
00:22:12,003 --> 00:22:17,463
So the zero represents ensure zero backup
errors through regular verification,

348
00:22:18,273 --> 00:22:24,093
regular test that backups are error free
and can be successfully restored ac.

349
00:22:24,153 --> 00:22:28,853
According to your Veeam survey, 40%
of recovery attempt fail and 70,

350
00:22:28,853 --> 00:22:33,873
70, 70 7% of our nations don't test
their backups frequently enough.

351
00:22:34,373 --> 00:22:36,273
I did mention a couple of terms there.

352
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:39,693
One is immutable, other one is AirCap.

353
00:22:39,753 --> 00:22:40,763
So let's see.

354
00:22:40,763 --> 00:22:41,903
What are those main terms?

355
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:48,873
So the immutable backups or write ones,
read many, like one model apply to

356
00:22:48,873 --> 00:22:54,653
backup data provides immutability to
recover from accidental or mania ions.

357
00:22:54,713 --> 00:22:58,313
Once data is written to your warm
compliant backup system, which is.

358
00:22:58,838 --> 00:23:00,158
Right ones read many.

359
00:23:00,308 --> 00:23:02,228
It cannot be altered or deleted.

360
00:23:02,498 --> 00:23:07,688
This immutability is your first line of
defense against both accidental deletions.

361
00:23:08,188 --> 00:23:10,198
And the next one is a gap walls.

362
00:23:10,378 --> 00:23:13,978
So this a gap walls is
the key to secure backups.

363
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:18,608
But immu immutability alone
isn't always enough, like what

364
00:23:18,608 --> 00:23:19,928
we talked about just before.

365
00:23:20,078 --> 00:23:24,518
So we did say that this immutability
is your first line of defense,

366
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:27,608
but it's not just always enough.

367
00:23:27,998 --> 00:23:32,638
With the recent threats, technology
or sophistication that what is going

368
00:23:32,638 --> 00:23:36,958
through these hands on wear, we need
to take it to the next step further.

369
00:23:37,378 --> 00:23:40,378
That's where the concept
of a gap vault comes in.

370
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:46,258
So imagine a secure, isolated
location for your immutable backup.

371
00:23:47,068 --> 00:23:51,148
This vault is logically separated
from your primary environment.

372
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:55,678
Make it significantly harder
for threats to reach and

373
00:23:55,678 --> 00:23:57,508
compromise your recovery data.

374
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:03,538
With the air gap vault, the immutable
backup copies are locked by default and

375
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:09,118
further protected through encryption
using service provider owned case.

376
00:24:09,238 --> 00:24:12,088
It's not a custom manager
or customer created keys.

377
00:24:12,848 --> 00:24:16,808
These are with the Hyatt highest
level of encryption, like a S 2 56.

378
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:22,628
Encrypting recovery points within
service provider owned key, not only

379
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:27,818
safeguards against accidental or unwanted
deletions of user management keys,

380
00:24:27,938 --> 00:24:32,288
but also reduces operational overhead
and key management costs for users.

381
00:24:32,288 --> 00:24:36,958
I. The Logically aid gap Vault
simplifies sharing backups for

382
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:42,508
restore purposes across accounts using
Resource Access Manager called ran.

383
00:24:42,778 --> 00:24:47,098
So customers can share the vault
data with the specific accounts,

384
00:24:47,128 --> 00:24:51,678
including cross organization, cross
region for faster direct restored.

385
00:24:51,918 --> 00:24:55,878
Once the vault is shared, the
backups can be directly restored.

386
00:24:56,313 --> 00:25:00,453
Removing the step where backups are
copied into the destination account

387
00:25:00,453 --> 00:25:05,863
first this reduces the operational
overhead time to recover from a data

388
00:25:05,863 --> 00:25:08,263
loss event and cost of extra copies.

389
00:25:08,983 --> 00:25:12,133
These walls can be configured
in couple of modes.

390
00:25:12,223 --> 00:25:14,703
So one is governance
mode and governance mode.

391
00:25:15,183 --> 00:25:16,113
So what is the difference?

392
00:25:16,113 --> 00:25:18,363
Like what is governance mode
and what is compliance mode?

393
00:25:18,363 --> 00:25:22,383
Governance mode is intended to allow
a war to be managed only by the

394
00:25:22,383 --> 00:25:25,173
users with sufficient IAM privileges.

395
00:25:25,443 --> 00:25:29,903
So that means specific level of
administrators can only administer them.

396
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:32,888
Vault lock is deletable if needed.

397
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:37,028
So all the recovery points in the
vault are locked and cannot be

398
00:25:37,028 --> 00:25:39,158
deleted until the lock is lifted.

399
00:25:40,118 --> 00:25:43,718
So that's the governance mode and the
compliance mode is a little bit different.

400
00:25:43,718 --> 00:25:48,428
So this is designed for backup walls
in which the vault is expected to

401
00:25:49,058 --> 00:25:53,228
never be deleted or altered until the
data retention period is complete.

402
00:25:53,528 --> 00:25:56,453
So when a vault is comple
is in compliance mode.

403
00:25:57,263 --> 00:25:57,953
Is locked.

404
00:25:58,283 --> 00:26:01,073
The lock can't be changed
because it's immutable.

405
00:26:01,463 --> 00:26:06,623
No one including the root user or your
service provider can manage or remove it.

406
00:26:07,403 --> 00:26:12,413
However, you can define a grace period,
also known as cooling off period before

407
00:26:12,413 --> 00:26:14,993
the war locks and becomes immutable.

408
00:26:15,413 --> 00:26:19,228
The only method to remove the
lock is to terminate the account.

409
00:26:19,228 --> 00:26:20,713
However, doing so also.

410
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:24,513
Deletes all your previous
backups if needed.

411
00:26:24,723 --> 00:26:29,523
Accounts can be restored from cloud
service providers within some time limits.

412
00:26:29,523 --> 00:26:34,563
So example, AWS, if your account is
getting deleted, then you can always

413
00:26:34,563 --> 00:26:36,273
restore it back within the 90 days.

414
00:26:36,273 --> 00:26:37,773
So that's an AM amount of time.

415
00:26:38,273 --> 00:26:39,683
And then implementation tip.

416
00:26:39,863 --> 00:26:46,463
So AWS backup and Google Cloud now
offers logically walls that are immutable

417
00:26:46,463 --> 00:26:48,203
by default with compliance mode.

418
00:26:48,203 --> 00:26:48,863
Wall log.

419
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:52,793
These walls support cross account
sharing with the resource access

420
00:26:52,793 --> 00:26:58,013
manager and use service phone KMS keys
to protect against key compromise.

421
00:26:58,403 --> 00:27:01,913
Along with these two providers,
there are other custom providing

422
00:27:01,973 --> 00:27:04,033
solution providers like, veeam.

423
00:27:04,183 --> 00:27:08,843
And then there's other one,
ELAs osteo, there's a red bear.

424
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:12,753
So there are multiple these different
multiple vendors that who supports

425
00:27:12,753 --> 00:27:15,208
these kind of AAF vault solutions.

426
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:17,478
And then moving on.

427
00:27:17,568 --> 00:27:21,138
So let's move on to the
advanced backup architecture.

428
00:27:21,198 --> 00:27:25,338
So let's discuss how to implement a
ransom resilient backup architecture.

429
00:27:26,253 --> 00:27:30,943
So if you look at this so before
I go into the architecture diagram

430
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:35,403
explanation, so I'll just do a little
bit approach like so how this is

431
00:27:35,463 --> 00:27:37,113
approached to recovery architecture.

432
00:27:37,233 --> 00:27:39,663
So it's a multi-layered approach.

433
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:43,683
In the security world, there is a
concept known as defense and depth.

434
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:48,843
So let's take a very similar approach
in terms of making it harder for bad

435
00:27:48,843 --> 00:27:51,273
actors to be able to compromise backups.

436
00:27:51,648 --> 00:27:55,968
But defense and depth, similar to
the analogy of casl, the A medieval

437
00:27:55,998 --> 00:28:00,578
casl where you have multiple layers
of defense, you'll have a MO filled

438
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,678
with water, you'll have big capes.

439
00:28:02,678 --> 00:28:05,558
A big approach is no different
in the security world.

440
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:10,718
So you want to make it as hard as
possible for the bad actors to be

441
00:28:10,718 --> 00:28:12,968
able to achieve those objectives.

442
00:28:13,468 --> 00:28:17,548
So implement a local backup walls
for operational backup needs.

443
00:28:18,178 --> 00:28:22,258
Create a logically air gap
walls in dedicated accounts

444
00:28:22,318 --> 00:28:24,058
to store immutable backups.

445
00:28:24,898 --> 00:28:29,128
So implement these logically air ga walls
for multi-cloud environments as well.

446
00:28:29,128 --> 00:28:32,578
So you can apply that for both
multi-cloud provider or standalone cloud

447
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:37,908
provider design, a cross design cross
region world architecture to provide

448
00:28:37,908 --> 00:28:39,858
production against regional disruption.

449
00:28:39,963 --> 00:28:42,508
So we do want to specify this because.

450
00:28:43,008 --> 00:28:48,578
If you are doing the backups in the same
region, when it comes to the disaster

451
00:28:48,578 --> 00:28:53,468
recovery, if something happens in that
region, could be natural disaster like

452
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,748
floods, fires, earthquake, anything.

453
00:28:56,558 --> 00:28:58,568
So this will really help you.

454
00:28:58,628 --> 00:29:01,928
So this will serve the boats of
both purposes, disaster recovery,

455
00:29:02,103 --> 00:29:05,458
as well as the ransomware recovery,
ransomware, backup and recovery.

456
00:29:06,093 --> 00:29:09,663
And then establish a clean room, so
which is like a new account for data

457
00:29:09,663 --> 00:29:11,913
validation from the aid gap world.

458
00:29:12,603 --> 00:29:18,033
So if you look at the diagram, so here,
so I have the main production workload

459
00:29:18,033 --> 00:29:19,743
accounts, which is in region one.

460
00:29:19,743 --> 00:29:24,503
So I have all these different type of
workloads starting from object stores,

461
00:29:24,503 --> 00:29:30,203
block storage, like computing resources,
relational databases, those equal

462
00:29:30,203 --> 00:29:33,263
databases or graph TVs or document ds.

463
00:29:33,803 --> 00:29:38,413
So all these are being, locked or
backed up to a local backup vault.

464
00:29:38,623 --> 00:29:43,393
So this local backup vault is being
encrypted with a, either a customer

465
00:29:43,663 --> 00:29:46,003
managed key or a service provider key.

466
00:29:46,153 --> 00:29:51,163
So this will help you in case of any
operational purposes, say you have

467
00:29:51,163 --> 00:29:55,728
some issue happen with your database
and you want to reach, restore the.

468
00:29:56,333 --> 00:30:00,443
Yesterday's backup or right before the
snapshot, right before that incident.

469
00:30:00,863 --> 00:30:04,943
So not related to the security
incident, but basically any

470
00:30:04,943 --> 00:30:08,483
operational incident that happened
internally or some deployment

471
00:30:08,483 --> 00:30:09,953
happened, which corrupted the data.

472
00:30:09,953 --> 00:30:11,213
So you want to roll it back.

473
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:15,338
So in those case scenarios, this
local backup port will help you.

474
00:30:15,838 --> 00:30:16,198
And the next one.

475
00:30:16,723 --> 00:30:21,463
So we are designing this, the air gap
vaults, to be in a dedicated account

476
00:30:21,463 --> 00:30:26,323
so that way, even if your primary
account gets compromised, you don't

477
00:30:26,323 --> 00:30:30,853
want the attacker to be connected to
your air gap vault account, so that

478
00:30:30,853 --> 00:30:37,243
way your Air Gap vault account is
completely isolated, cannot be reachable.

479
00:30:37,888 --> 00:30:42,678
Neither through network setup or your or
national network or production network to

480
00:30:42,678 --> 00:30:47,288
the dedicated account because you don't
need a network access kind of thing.

481
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:51,113
It can be either in the
same region or cross region.

482
00:30:51,173 --> 00:30:54,053
So for instance, for
demonstration purpose, I showed

483
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:55,253
you here as a region too.

484
00:30:55,613 --> 00:30:58,313
So that means we are calling
this as a data bunker account.

485
00:30:58,613 --> 00:31:03,713
So where you'll be saving or centralized
account to manage your a gap.

486
00:31:03,713 --> 00:31:09,138
World datas this one is being
guarded with a service provider keys

487
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:10,968
itself instead of your custom keys.

488
00:31:10,968 --> 00:31:11,748
So that way.

489
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:16,038
Even if something happened or attacker
gets gain access to the account, he

490
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:18,288
cannot do anything without the keys.

491
00:31:18,408 --> 00:31:23,628
So since it is not being created by
custom customer or custom key, it's a

492
00:31:23,688 --> 00:31:27,768
service provider, which he cannot, it's
impossible to get me access for the key.

493
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:33,768
So that makes it more harder for the
attacker to even touch the ACAP walls.

494
00:31:34,338 --> 00:31:38,918
So even if the account gets
account being compromised.

495
00:31:39,818 --> 00:31:43,178
The account, the backups are
immutable so it cannot be

496
00:31:43,178 --> 00:31:45,068
touched or altered or tampered.

497
00:31:45,248 --> 00:31:50,198
So all they can do is delete the account,
even if the account is been deleted.

498
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:52,658
We just talked about
it a little bit before.

499
00:31:52,928 --> 00:31:56,318
The accounts can be always be restored
within after some days or within a

500
00:31:56,318 --> 00:32:00,938
few months, so that way you still
have a chance of recording your data.

501
00:32:01,808 --> 00:32:04,658
And then the next crucial point here is.

502
00:32:05,158 --> 00:32:08,878
You have the backup account data,
bunker account where you are keeping

503
00:32:08,878 --> 00:32:14,638
your backups, and then, if the incident
happens, like if the ware attack happened

504
00:32:14,728 --> 00:32:20,438
and there is a need to restore your a
reward backup stuff to your account.

505
00:32:21,129 --> 00:32:24,309
We don't want to do that back to
your primary account like production

506
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:28,299
account again, back, because you never
know, the attackers still may have

507
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:29,889
access to your network somewhere.

508
00:32:30,579 --> 00:32:36,308
So don't assume that assume that it is
screen compromised, so don't ever put back

509
00:32:36,308 --> 00:32:42,008
your restore or backups or restored backup
solutions into the same account again.

510
00:32:42,788 --> 00:32:44,018
It'll be compromised again.

511
00:32:44,108 --> 00:32:47,348
The attacker can get an access and then
again, the same, repeated the same thing.

512
00:32:47,348 --> 00:32:48,338
So that's the first thing.

513
00:32:48,338 --> 00:32:50,498
So don't assume that
it's being compromised.

514
00:32:50,858 --> 00:32:52,478
You don't want to go back to that account.

515
00:32:53,078 --> 00:32:57,338
And the next option is you
create a, either you recover

516
00:32:57,338 --> 00:32:58,628
in the same backup account.

517
00:32:58,988 --> 00:33:03,518
Or you can create a fresh account so
that way you can deploy them clean.

518
00:33:03,668 --> 00:33:07,508
So that way you are sure that
attacker doesn't have any access

519
00:33:07,808 --> 00:33:11,588
that's clean, only you have access,
or your automation have access.

520
00:33:11,838 --> 00:33:16,738
Sometimes even if there's a the
assuming the backups are good

521
00:33:17,008 --> 00:33:18,858
is a is also a big mistake.

522
00:33:19,358 --> 00:33:23,078
So you need a security controls
for your backup systems.

523
00:33:23,348 --> 00:33:27,128
So you need implement multifactor
authentication for backup system access.

524
00:33:27,428 --> 00:33:31,328
Use role-based access control
with principle of least privilege.

525
00:33:31,928 --> 00:33:36,188
Enable geofencing to restrict access
from specific IP ranges because

526
00:33:36,188 --> 00:33:39,428
when in case to access the backups
you don't need, everybody doesn't

527
00:33:39,428 --> 00:33:41,408
need, doesn't access your backups.

528
00:33:41,468 --> 00:33:45,428
So only the administrators
or corresponding teams only.

529
00:33:45,863 --> 00:33:50,093
Do the just specific job, so you can
restrict that through the geofencing

530
00:33:50,843 --> 00:33:54,353
and set up detailed audit logging for
all your backup system activities.

531
00:33:54,413 --> 00:34:00,293
That means when these backups are being
done or initiated or completed, so make

532
00:34:00,293 --> 00:34:05,153
sure these actions are being logged so
that way you have a trail log and then

533
00:34:05,153 --> 00:34:09,743
deploy animal detections to identify
suspicious backup behavior in case.

534
00:34:10,243 --> 00:34:13,393
You wanna make sure if somebody trying
to tamper with your backup solutions

535
00:34:13,393 --> 00:34:15,703
as well, or backup systems or walls.

536
00:34:16,243 --> 00:34:20,263
So you need to make sure you have an
MLE detections enabled on these things

537
00:34:20,263 --> 00:34:22,063
to identify that kind of behavior.

538
00:34:22,963 --> 00:34:25,693
And also, next thing is
automated backup testing.

539
00:34:25,783 --> 00:34:31,243
So having backups a backup isn't a backup
until you have successfully restart it.

540
00:34:31,243 --> 00:34:37,703
So that means a crucial, but often
overlooked component is regular

541
00:34:37,703 --> 00:34:39,563
automated testing of your backups.

542
00:34:39,653 --> 00:34:43,853
So according to Gartner, 30% of our
nation that test their disaster recovery

543
00:34:43,853 --> 00:34:49,433
plans find critical gaps that would
have prevented successful recovery.

544
00:34:49,933 --> 00:34:53,993
So it's pretty important to have that
kind of automated backup testing.

545
00:34:54,023 --> 00:34:59,763
So in this scenario I explained or
design in such a way you, you can either.

546
00:35:00,378 --> 00:35:05,628
Do the automated testing in a different
account called the forensic account where

547
00:35:05,928 --> 00:35:12,228
you will be doing the backup, restore, and
then to a actual resource type that which

548
00:35:12,228 --> 00:35:15,078
you want to deploy the data to restore to.

549
00:35:15,828 --> 00:35:19,728
Using that, using the ram
like resource access managers.

550
00:35:19,728 --> 00:35:22,338
You don't need to do a
copy manually or anything.

551
00:35:22,338 --> 00:35:27,548
So it's easy with the air gap vault with
the resource access manager management

552
00:35:27,548 --> 00:35:32,138
access, so you can simply give the
access to a cross account or external

553
00:35:32,138 --> 00:35:37,178
account, anything that you trust, you
can configure that policy so that your

554
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:41,683
walls are being accessed to the your
resource can be accessed to the backups.

555
00:35:42,403 --> 00:35:46,483
Once you restore the backups in
the account or in the same account,

556
00:35:46,903 --> 00:35:51,733
you can test that backup data that
you need to make sure that you

557
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:57,513
validate data integrity, verify the
recoverability metrics, and then also

558
00:35:57,513 --> 00:35:59,223
schedule the regular test scores.

559
00:35:59,553 --> 00:36:05,403
So you do that and then you can
also add additional step on top

560
00:36:05,403 --> 00:36:10,353
of it, like a scanning, scan your
data that you restored, so that way

561
00:36:10,353 --> 00:36:12,993
your data is clean, malware free.

562
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:17,443
Or any kind of ransomware kind of
malware, so that way you can set

563
00:36:17,443 --> 00:36:21,493
up alerts if something like the
automation, automated backup testing

564
00:36:22,003 --> 00:36:23,893
completed successfully or not.

565
00:36:23,893 --> 00:36:27,073
So that way you will be informed and
if it is something happened, you have

566
00:36:27,073 --> 00:36:32,323
a way to track it and then pay the pay
immediate attention to that step or alert.

567
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:34,833
And then automatically
clean up the test resource.

568
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:38,733
So once you're done with automa, automated
backup testing, you need to make sure

569
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:42,933
you clean up your resource because
this is going to incur cost costs if

570
00:36:42,933 --> 00:36:47,023
you want to keep them running, because
it's just not a one-time iteration.

571
00:36:47,023 --> 00:36:50,653
It'll be keep happening every day
or every, based on how you schedule

572
00:36:50,653 --> 00:36:52,263
that kind of backup validation.

573
00:36:52,263 --> 00:36:55,843
It could be weekly ones, daily ones
monthly ones, something like that.

574
00:36:56,773 --> 00:36:59,533
So make sure you document
results for compliance purposes.

575
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:03,673
And then the last one
is how do you recover?

576
00:37:03,673 --> 00:37:07,993
So in case of actual incidents
happen now you have all these

577
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:10,183
precautionary steps all in place.

578
00:37:10,483 --> 00:37:15,193
You have the eight gap walls, you have
the locked vault locks, you have the.

579
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,958
Game as Keys service
provider game as keys.

580
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:23,458
You have the Restore automated test,
backup testing capacities, including

581
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:28,288
the scanning of the restore resources or
data and the data integrity validations.

582
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:30,748
So all these are steps
are already been placed.

583
00:37:31,018 --> 00:37:36,673
So now I. It's a one step thing that you
can restore your data in case of actual

584
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:40,923
incident, if some attack happens and
you cannot use your primary production

585
00:37:40,923 --> 00:37:45,633
environment, you can simply create
a new recovery account or clean room

586
00:37:46,053 --> 00:37:51,148
and then provide the resource access,
management access through the ran.

587
00:37:51,693 --> 00:37:56,343
Through your backup air gap ward to the
new account that you created, and then

588
00:37:56,343 --> 00:37:58,663
you can restore the backups straight.

589
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:02,833
You don't even need to copy the
backups from the Air gap ward account

590
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:06,333
to the new clean room because that's
the beauty of air gap ward log.

591
00:38:06,603 --> 00:38:10,523
So you can just assume that role and
then deploy it, restore, restored

592
00:38:10,733 --> 00:38:15,263
into your new clean room, and then
your applications, your all your data

593
00:38:15,263 --> 00:38:17,233
is being restored and ready to go.

594
00:38:17,733 --> 00:38:21,683
So that's a that's a design of a
ransomware recovery architecture, how

595
00:38:21,683 --> 00:38:23,393
you can implement that's effective.

596
00:38:23,393 --> 00:38:25,103
We have, and then the.

597
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:29,143
As I mentioned earlier, restore
testing is a critical piece

598
00:38:29,143 --> 00:38:30,583
that you need to consider.

599
00:38:30,863 --> 00:38:33,203
So most often this has been overlooked.

600
00:38:33,773 --> 00:38:38,063
Backup, restore testing can assess re
recoverability of your business data

601
00:38:38,063 --> 00:38:42,803
against data loss events and prove the
recovery posture of for compliance using

602
00:38:42,803 --> 00:38:44,903
custom defined resource testing plans.

603
00:38:44,903 --> 00:38:49,013
Because sometimes organizations do
have different kind of complaints

604
00:38:49,013 --> 00:38:51,908
that they need to follow, depending
on type of industry they are in

605
00:38:52,298 --> 00:38:54,968
financial healthcare kind of things.

606
00:38:55,088 --> 00:38:58,868
So those, this will really
help in managing that posture

607
00:38:58,868 --> 00:39:00,758
strong periodic resource test.

608
00:39:01,128 --> 00:39:03,658
The supported resources
that's been backing up.

609
00:39:04,078 --> 00:39:08,838
This will give you a much confidence
on restore care capabilities.

610
00:39:09,338 --> 00:39:13,228
And then moving on to the next
section, which is a ba what factors

611
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:17,888
impact the cost on these backup cost
associations or backup cost factors?

612
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:18,488
You can say.

613
00:39:19,478 --> 00:39:24,413
So there are four areas like scope,
how much data needs protection, and

614
00:39:24,413 --> 00:39:29,618
then frequency, how often should
backups occur, and then retention.

615
00:39:29,798 --> 00:39:32,023
How long should backups be stored.

616
00:39:32,523 --> 00:39:33,903
And then the last one is copies.

617
00:39:33,933 --> 00:39:35,943
How many redundant copies are necessary?

618
00:39:36,443 --> 00:39:41,333
So based on these things,
you, your cost can vary.

619
00:39:41,873 --> 00:39:47,063
So if you look at here, so that the
re resiliency options that you want

620
00:39:47,063 --> 00:39:51,563
to choose in the cloud environments,
so usually the backup and restore,

621
00:39:51,773 --> 00:39:57,203
that's a least cost associated because
your RPO and RT was typically in ours.

622
00:39:57,703 --> 00:40:01,463
And then the pilot light,
which is like a ready to go.

623
00:40:01,543 --> 00:40:03,453
But it can take a little
bit recovery point.

624
00:40:03,453 --> 00:40:04,683
Object too can be minutes.

625
00:40:04,683 --> 00:40:08,613
And recovery time object is an hour,
so that means your data is within

626
00:40:08,613 --> 00:40:12,573
the tolerable time, like a few
minutes, but your restore time is

627
00:40:12,963 --> 00:40:15,393
within one hour or one and a half,
two hours, something like that.

628
00:40:15,893 --> 00:40:19,823
And then the warm standby, this will
increase the cost as well because you

629
00:40:19,823 --> 00:40:23,543
are almost maintaining a secondary
kind of setup or environment.

630
00:40:23,843 --> 00:40:29,023
But you will get a good RPO and RTO in
minutes, but the cost will be much more.

631
00:40:29,743 --> 00:40:33,883
Then coming to the last one, act
two Act traditionally in the on-prem

632
00:40:34,123 --> 00:40:37,833
infrastructures architecture kind
of thing, used to have Act two.

633
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:41,463
Act two, like we used to have a
act two data center, and then there

634
00:40:41,613 --> 00:40:45,873
disaster recovery data center set
up where you have the global load

635
00:40:45,873 --> 00:40:47,673
balancers for every application.

636
00:40:47,673 --> 00:40:51,153
If something goes down in one of
one data center, automatically,

637
00:40:51,153 --> 00:40:52,233
the other one will pick up.

638
00:40:52,348 --> 00:40:57,418
The route traffic will be routed, so
it's like within seconds you won't

639
00:40:57,418 --> 00:40:59,678
see any customer impact or anything.

640
00:40:59,738 --> 00:41:02,558
So it's within seconds
or within real time.

641
00:41:02,888 --> 00:41:08,198
Your RPO and rts are close to real time,
and then cost is much more because you are

642
00:41:08,198 --> 00:41:10,508
paying twice your production environment.

643
00:41:10,748 --> 00:41:12,178
So that's that you should be wary of.

644
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:15,908
And then coming to cost
optimizations or use cases.

645
00:41:15,938 --> 00:41:20,318
So where this majority of your data
being sitting in your environments

646
00:41:20,368 --> 00:41:25,298
majorly you have three kind of storage
places where one is a block storage.

647
00:41:25,743 --> 00:41:28,673
Something like if I want to take
an analogy of AWS, like it's

648
00:41:28,673 --> 00:41:33,143
EBS volumes, like ideal for high
performance applications requiring

649
00:41:33,383 --> 00:41:37,553
fast access to data, and then
the other one is object storage.

650
00:41:37,613 --> 00:41:40,673
These are best for unstructured
data and large scale storage

651
00:41:40,673 --> 00:41:42,563
needs, like logs or anything.

652
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:46,853
So this is something related to,
you can analogy with S3 in AWS.

653
00:41:47,573 --> 00:41:52,073
And then the other one is relational
database or the non-relational databases.

654
00:41:52,463 --> 00:41:56,243
This is suitable for applications
needing complex queries and transactions.

655
00:41:56,543 --> 00:42:00,293
Typically, this is like
your RDS in the AWS.

656
00:42:00,773 --> 00:42:01,643
It could be anything.

657
00:42:01,643 --> 00:42:07,233
It could be my QL Postgres,
M-S-S-Q-L, or even the No SQL DB

658
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,493
Cassandra, something like that.

659
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:12,353
So these are the usual cases there
where you will be mostly, you'll be

660
00:42:12,353 --> 00:42:14,213
placing or holding your data onto.

661
00:42:14,588 --> 00:42:19,208
So based on how your application is
designed when it comes to the automation

662
00:42:19,208 --> 00:42:24,368
best practices, since we know the which
kind of what kind of cloud storage

663
00:42:24,368 --> 00:42:26,848
that you are using for your use cases.

664
00:42:27,268 --> 00:42:30,718
Based on that we can derive the
cost optimization based practices.

665
00:42:31,168 --> 00:42:35,728
So in terms of block storage, so this
is especially like block storage,

666
00:42:35,728 --> 00:42:40,288
something like EBS know your change
rate and projected gout, so you know.

667
00:42:40,648 --> 00:42:44,758
How much data you'll be accumulating or
what is the growth that you projected?

668
00:42:44,758 --> 00:42:48,868
Accumulated data and retain backups
only as long as needed because this

669
00:42:48,868 --> 00:42:53,038
could cost you a little bit more and
use cold storage when appropriate.

670
00:42:53,038 --> 00:42:57,058
So if you, if your data is not
in operation that you just need

671
00:42:57,058 --> 00:43:00,878
it for some kind of rare usage
you can use a cold storage.

672
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:04,918
That way you can reduce the storage
storage cost for, especially

673
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:05,968
related to block storage.

674
00:43:06,718 --> 00:43:09,598
And then the obs object
storage, so something like S3.

675
00:43:09,958 --> 00:43:14,758
So use continuous backups with periodic
backups, delete order back object

676
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:20,338
versions and clean up expired, delete
markets markers, adjust backup retention

677
00:43:20,428 --> 00:43:22,258
and copy frequency retention if needed.

678
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:25,638
Because those are the few ways
that you can optimize your costs

679
00:43:25,758 --> 00:43:27,378
in the object storage class.

680
00:43:28,113 --> 00:43:31,843
And the third one is database
or relational database storages.

681
00:43:31,933 --> 00:43:36,703
So you can leverage free backup during
continuous backup retention periods.

682
00:43:36,793 --> 00:43:41,533
Some providers offer these kind of
initial free backups, and then you only

683
00:43:41,533 --> 00:43:43,693
keep backups past continuous backups.

684
00:43:44,193 --> 00:43:50,188
Factor in backup copies costs because
based on your database size, you are you.

685
00:43:50,193 --> 00:43:54,303
You can incur a lot of costs when
you want to have number of copies,

686
00:43:54,303 --> 00:43:57,873
more number of copies, so that
will impact directly to your costs.

687
00:43:57,873 --> 00:44:03,353
Associations access and understand your
current cloud backup costs because you

688
00:44:03,353 --> 00:44:07,733
can assess your, what is your current
storage costs are, cloud operation

689
00:44:07,733 --> 00:44:11,843
costs are, and then how, what kind of
backup solution that you are planning.

690
00:44:11,933 --> 00:44:17,223
Like we, we just discussed our couple of
our picture styles or our pictures that

691
00:44:17,223 --> 00:44:19,813
can pull foolproof ransomware readiness.

692
00:44:20,313 --> 00:44:24,193
So these will give you a little bit
more understanding on your backup costs.

693
00:44:24,283 --> 00:44:28,393
Implement lifecycle policies to
automatically move older backups

694
00:44:28,573 --> 00:44:33,583
to lawyers cost storage tiers while
maintaining appropriate accessibility,

695
00:44:33,673 --> 00:44:37,363
because that's, you don't want to
have these ever-growing storage

696
00:44:37,393 --> 00:44:40,803
needs on a hot or hot storages.

697
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:45,413
So you can go for in infrequent
access or glacier storage,

698
00:44:45,473 --> 00:44:46,943
something like that kind of things.

699
00:44:47,033 --> 00:44:51,523
So that can reduce your storage
costs, especially related to

700
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:54,613
the cloud optimizations or cost
optimization best practices,

701
00:44:54,613 --> 00:44:56,743
especially related to the storage.

702
00:44:57,243 --> 00:44:59,183
So moving on.

703
00:44:59,393 --> 00:45:02,033
Building a ransomware
incident response plan.

704
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,233
So despite.

705
00:45:03,623 --> 00:45:08,903
Your best efforts, a ransomware attack
may still occur, so therefore, it's

706
00:45:08,903 --> 00:45:13,913
essential to have a robust incident
response plan in place to minimize the

707
00:45:13,913 --> 00:45:16,853
impact and facilitate a safe recovery.

708
00:45:17,603 --> 00:45:21,293
So you need to, there are a few
areas that you need to focus on.

709
00:45:21,443 --> 00:45:23,873
So define roles and responsibilities.

710
00:45:23,873 --> 00:45:27,323
So you need to make sure, establish
a cross-functional incident

711
00:45:27,323 --> 00:45:31,853
response team clearly define
who makes critical decisions.

712
00:45:32,453 --> 00:45:37,163
Include technical, legal, communications
and executive stakeholders.

713
00:45:37,853 --> 00:45:41,243
Document backup escalation
contacts for each one, each role.

714
00:45:41,873 --> 00:45:46,853
Believe me, these things will help you
a lot when you are in a real incident

715
00:45:47,783 --> 00:45:49,883
and then create communication protocols.

716
00:45:50,378 --> 00:45:54,423
So when some when things get seized,
you don't have a way to communicate in

717
00:45:54,423 --> 00:45:59,733
a normal organization, the communication
channels can be down, depending on

718
00:45:59,733 --> 00:46:03,583
what type of incident happened on the
type of ransomware attack happened.

719
00:46:03,943 --> 00:46:07,253
So it could be your administrative
tools or platforms got

720
00:46:07,333 --> 00:46:09,713
encrypted or, systems impacted.

721
00:46:09,713 --> 00:46:13,133
So in those cases, you don't have a
way to communicate in a regular way.

722
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:16,493
Instead, you should create
your communication protocols

723
00:46:16,493 --> 00:46:17,993
in case if something happens.

724
00:46:18,173 --> 00:46:23,483
So establish secure outand communication
channels, develop templates for

725
00:46:23,483 --> 00:46:25,283
internal and external communications.

726
00:46:25,643 --> 00:46:29,093
Include notification procedures
for regulatory requirements,

727
00:46:29,513 --> 00:46:33,828
document contact information for law
enforcement, and third party experts.

728
00:46:34,328 --> 00:46:38,088
Document recovery procedure is also
important because you need to create a

729
00:46:38,088 --> 00:46:43,758
step-by-step recovery playbook so that you
know who you know, who needs to do which

730
00:46:43,758 --> 00:46:46,158
parts, and what are the sequence of steps.

731
00:46:46,518 --> 00:46:50,208
And you need to include decision
trees for various attack scenarios

732
00:46:50,688 --> 00:46:54,858
and document restore procedures
for inform immutable backups.

733
00:46:55,308 --> 00:46:58,248
Maintain up to date system
conversation documentation.

734
00:46:58,818 --> 00:46:59,658
So these things.

735
00:47:00,158 --> 00:47:00,668
Excuse me.

736
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:03,798
And then the last one, practice regularly.

737
00:47:03,858 --> 00:47:06,028
This is the most oftenly over liquid item.

738
00:47:06,328 --> 00:47:08,463
So until, unless you test your backups.

739
00:47:08,963 --> 00:47:12,463
Unless you test your backups and they're
valid, you cannot call them backups.

740
00:47:12,523 --> 00:47:15,073
So you need to practice these regularly.

741
00:47:15,103 --> 00:47:20,503
So conduct tabletop exercises quarterly,
run full recovery simulations at

742
00:47:20,503 --> 00:47:22,393
least annually or semi-annually.

743
00:47:22,723 --> 00:47:26,743
Update processes based on
exercise findings involve

744
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:28,783
executors in practice scenarios.

745
00:47:29,728 --> 00:47:34,438
Remember that in the heat of incident
documented procedures are invaluable.

746
00:47:34,738 --> 00:47:38,848
The National Institute of Standards and
Technology reports that organizations

747
00:47:38,848 --> 00:47:43,918
with documented incident response
plans resolve incidents 40% faster

748
00:47:43,918 --> 00:47:45,453
than those without these plans.

749
00:47:45,953 --> 00:47:50,833
So coming to the end, so I'll just
to do a few conclusion and key stake,

750
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:52,853
key takeaways from this session.

751
00:47:53,353 --> 00:47:54,973
To wrap up today's discussion.

752
00:47:54,973 --> 00:47:57,553
So let's emphasize these critical points.

753
00:47:57,853 --> 00:48:02,893
So ransomware is evolving and
inevitable, so it's not going away.

754
00:48:02,893 --> 00:48:05,983
So you need to, it's not
a matter of if, but when.

755
00:48:06,223 --> 00:48:10,603
So that threat landscape continue
to evolve with attacks becoming

756
00:48:10,603 --> 00:48:12,343
more sophisticated and demanding.

757
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:17,113
So how, it doesn't matter how,
what kind of shift left kind

758
00:48:17,113 --> 00:48:18,553
of strategy that you follow.

759
00:48:19,543 --> 00:48:24,323
Predict two or pro to or detect two
kind of tools that you implement

760
00:48:24,323 --> 00:48:25,823
or technologies that you have.

761
00:48:26,323 --> 00:48:30,893
The scale that it is evolving, the
ransomware is evolving, the threat

762
00:48:30,893 --> 00:48:35,503
landscape is abnormal so that the
sophistication is also extended with

763
00:48:35,553 --> 00:48:38,203
recently with the ai introduction.

764
00:48:38,293 --> 00:48:40,898
So you know for sure it's not.

765
00:48:41,398 --> 00:48:46,668
It's not if, but when, and then
backups are your last line of defense.

766
00:48:46,908 --> 00:48:47,688
So believe me.

767
00:48:47,688 --> 00:48:52,158
So if, but only if backups are
properly protected, tested,

768
00:48:52,368 --> 00:48:57,768
recoverable, adopting the 3, 2,
1, 1 0 rule that we talked about.

769
00:48:57,978 --> 00:48:58,218
Zero.

770
00:48:58,333 --> 00:49:03,408
Trust, ransomware architecture, and
immutable backups provide a solid

771
00:49:03,408 --> 00:49:05,658
foundation for ransomware resilience.

772
00:49:06,158 --> 00:49:09,338
And the third one, recovery
capabilities must be tested.

773
00:49:09,518 --> 00:49:13,268
So untested backups often
fail when needed most.

774
00:49:13,598 --> 00:49:18,218
So regular testing is essential to
ensure your recover capabilities are

775
00:49:18,218 --> 00:49:24,518
functional and prepare preparedness
preparation reduces impact.

776
00:49:24,788 --> 00:49:30,488
So orations with documented and
practice response plans recover faster

777
00:49:30,488 --> 00:49:32,708
and experience less financial impact.

778
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:36,568
And then the last but not least
is incident response requires

779
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:38,278
cross-functional collaborations.

780
00:49:38,998 --> 00:49:43,258
So the technical teams, executives,
legal, communications, and other

781
00:49:43,258 --> 00:49:48,058
stakeholders must work together
tirelessly during an incident.

782
00:49:49,048 --> 00:49:51,868
So I would like to close with this part.

783
00:49:52,498 --> 00:49:55,408
Ransomware readiness isn't
just about technology.

784
00:49:55,783 --> 00:49:59,083
It's about people,
process and preparation.

785
00:49:59,593 --> 00:50:03,463
The organization that handle
ransomware incident most effectively

786
00:50:03,553 --> 00:50:07,543
are those that have invested
time in planning, practicing, and

787
00:50:07,543 --> 00:50:10,243
preparing before an attack occurs.

788
00:50:11,053 --> 00:50:14,413
Thank you for attending
today's UDE conference.

789
00:50:14,413 --> 00:50:17,523
Hope this session is useful
for you and your our nation.

790
00:50:18,183 --> 00:50:18,543
Thank you.
