1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,780
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,180
this is Pradeep Reddy Gupta.

3
00:00:02,219 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm here to discuss, about cloud native
application and then its principles.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,729
primarily Salesforce and its AI innovation
being leveraged as a cloud network

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:17,259
application and then how it's transforming
the AI, agentic AI in the CRM workspace.

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,280
And let's get into the agenda of this
discussion today and I'm going to

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,520
start with some introduction about
what is cloud native application and

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,550
then what its principles are and then
we'll deep dive into containerization

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,559
orchestration of these microservices
using cloud native application.

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,690
Kubernetes and then multicloud sub
multicloud support, metadata driven design

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,220
and how it's impacting or like improving
the scalability and performance of all

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,050
these SaaS applications behind the scenes.

13
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:48,000
and then at last, some Salesforce
agent AI in innovation, which

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,120
is called Salesforce Agent Force
built as cloud native application.

15
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,010
And then we'll end up some with
some conclusion note keynotes on it.

16
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,030
Thank you.

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,340
So introduction to cloud native
application, the cloud native

18
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,100
principles are main, back end
things that any cloud native

19
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,340
infrastructure app has to be built on.

20
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,380
So it has to be with some
containerization and then microservices

21
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,730
and then some orchestration.

22
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:15,429
And then for a metadata driven
support has to be there.

23
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:19,319
And then Salesforce platform AI is
indeed a cloud native application.

24
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:22,039
So it's leveraging all the
cloud native technologies.

25
00:01:22,414 --> 00:01:24,924
to build and deploy services back in.

26
00:01:25,024 --> 00:01:30,014
So those, the, it's offering a software as
service, but its infrastructure is built

27
00:01:30,014 --> 00:01:32,695
on its own AWS servers, behind the scenes.

28
00:01:32,735 --> 00:01:37,835
But it's offering all these through
orchestrations and then microservices

29
00:01:38,044 --> 00:01:41,765
using Docker, containerization,
and then Kubernetes orchestration.

30
00:01:42,285 --> 00:01:44,885
So if you look at this diagram,
any cloud infrastructure needs

31
00:01:44,885 --> 00:01:46,285
to have all these containers.

32
00:01:46,725 --> 00:01:49,895
All these backend services and
automation and then microservices

33
00:01:49,905 --> 00:01:51,485
and modern metadata design.

34
00:01:51,965 --> 00:01:56,075
So that's how any cloud native
app on an infrastructure works in

35
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:57,355
the behind the scenes platform.

36
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,495
There are cloud native principles.

37
00:01:59,835 --> 00:02:05,094
So like I said, microservices,
containerization, orchestration, the

38
00:02:05,095 --> 00:02:06,735
provisioning and then automation.

39
00:02:06,785 --> 00:02:10,455
All of these are part and
parcel of this cloud native app.

40
00:02:10,955 --> 00:02:14,775
So let's look into
containerization and microservices.

41
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:18,460
How Salesforce has transitioned
from a monolithic architectures to

42
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,240
microservices, and which are often
containerized and managed by Kubernetes,

43
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,490
which is the latest innovation.

44
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,179
And this allows for more agile
development, easier maintenance,

45
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,849
and better scalability of having
these platforms available on the, on

46
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,539
the servers, for all the customers.

47
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:36,309
By using microservices, Salesforce
can scale individual components of

48
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:41,359
its platform independently, improving
overall performance and resilience.

49
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:44,499
and then Kubernetes for orchestration.

50
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:49,140
If you think about, Salesforce using
Kubernetes is a, big microservices

51
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,419
platform behind the scenes, like on
its all environments, including both

52
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:58,399
on prem and public cloud deployments,
ensuring consistence and reliable service

53
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,170
deliverability for all its customers.

54
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,530
Kubernetes helps automated deployments,
scaling, and management of applications

55
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:11,759
aligning with cloud native principles,
primarily for automation and efficiency.

56
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,840
And then multi cloud support.

57
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,279
It can support all the multi clouds.

58
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:19,170
Salesforce has its own multi
clouds, and then they call us

59
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,240
like Salesforce Hyperforce.

60
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,660
It allows the platform to be
deployed on multiple platforms.

61
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:29,135
Public cloud providers like
AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.

62
00:03:29,535 --> 00:03:34,395
This flexibility is a hallmark of
cloud native applications, enabling

63
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:37,795
businesses to choose the best
infrastructure for their needs by

64
00:03:37,795 --> 00:03:40,385
supporting multiple Cloud providers.

65
00:03:40,415 --> 00:03:44,325
Salesforce ensures all its platform is
up running and easily replied and managed

66
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:48,525
across different environments without
significant reconfigurations because

67
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:53,425
it is supporting all multi clouds and
then it's all scalable and efficient.

68
00:03:54,215 --> 00:03:56,734
And then when you talk about
metadata driven design.

69
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:02,435
Salesforce architecture itself is metadata
driven, and it's not dependent on like

70
00:04:02,695 --> 00:04:06,855
on prem things, but it's all about more
dynamic and then more configurable, which

71
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:10,805
means most of its platform's functionality
is defined and managed through

72
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:13,954
metadata rather than hard coded logics.

73
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:17,825
The approach is more scalable
and customizable, and then

74
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:19,515
it's rapid in its development.

75
00:04:19,965 --> 00:04:24,645
The metadata driven design, allows
easier integration with other cloud

76
00:04:24,675 --> 00:04:28,825
native services, and then it can easily
integrate to other, SaaS applications.

77
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:31,575
And then scalability of performance.

78
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:35,665
So Salesforce cloud native design ensures
that the platform can handle large volumes

79
00:04:35,665 --> 00:04:38,705
of data and then user traffic efficiently.

80
00:04:38,985 --> 00:04:41,985
The use of distributed systems
and scalable storage solutions

81
00:04:41,985 --> 00:04:46,569
like Salesforce database supports
high performance and reliability.

82
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,370
Which it means all possible
through the cloud native principles

83
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,840
that being followed in its
infrastructure behind the scenes.

84
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,950
And now let's dig into the
Salesforce agent force.

85
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:01,420
So Salesforce came up with a new
innovation in AI, which has been

86
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,120
investing as like Einstein and
then many other clouds in the past

87
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,740
to support all the CRM workspace.

88
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,720
Now they came up with the data
cloud and then agent force.

89
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:15,740
Both of them are, which are tightly
coupled with the CRM and then data and

90
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,730
then trust itself with the compliance.

91
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,250
So they all like, work hand in
hand to make, to ensure like the

92
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:26,020
virtual agents for customer service
or sales or marketing agents.

93
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,520
It's not it's replacing all the agents
jobs, but it's all about, an agent is

94
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,810
still working around the clock of the
business hours for all his customers.

95
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,090
It can be a chatbot.

96
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:41,400
It can be, any of those, on demand
support agents working virtually.

97
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,480
So that's how it's all.

98
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,540
But it's behind the scenes.

99
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,170
It's using data cloud and
then containerization.

100
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,550
The cloud native principles as
infrastructure built on AWS.

101
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,500
That's one of those, year.

102
00:05:53,095 --> 00:05:57,345
let's dig into this, how these LLMs are
built on, the instant trust layer, what

103
00:05:57,345 --> 00:06:01,745
they call, and then it's come up, it
comes with the data masking, and it comes

104
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:07,665
with a dynamic grounding, and then audit
trail, and then demasking, and then it

105
00:06:07,665 --> 00:06:13,675
all also comes with a shield, and then
all the layers are like built on the SAS

106
00:06:13,685 --> 00:06:18,175
platforms for which all behind the scenes
will be the, Cloud native application.

107
00:06:18,175 --> 00:06:20,905
So this entire cloud itself
is Salesforce is built on it.

108
00:06:21,325 --> 00:06:25,365
So at last I would like to conclude
this session with some conclusion.

109
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:29,725
By leveraging cloud native technologies,
Salesforce has been scaling its

110
00:06:29,725 --> 00:06:34,195
services dynamically to meet
changing demand, ensuring consistent

111
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:36,195
performance for its users worldwide.

112
00:06:37,185 --> 00:06:41,365
In summary, in a nutshell, Salesforce
cloud native principles by leveraging

113
00:06:41,395 --> 00:06:45,685
containerization, microservices,
Kubernetes and admin editor driven

114
00:06:45,715 --> 00:06:50,005
architecture to deliver scalable,
flexible and high performance cloud

115
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,055
applications for all its customers.

116
00:06:52,935 --> 00:06:54,575
I hope you enjoyed this session.

117
00:06:54,895 --> 00:06:56,984
and thank you very much for being with me.

118
00:06:56,994 --> 00:07:01,005
And then I'm appreciating, and
giving thanking Conf42 platform

119
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:04,385
for giving me this opportunity
to leverage this content on.

120
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:05,035
Thank you.

121
00:07:05,145 --> 00:07:05,855
Have a great day.
