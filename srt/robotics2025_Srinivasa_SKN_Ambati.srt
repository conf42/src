1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,160
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,199
It's such a pleasure to be
here with you all of you today.

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:09,690
So my name is Rinni Vasa Ti and
I currently serve as a engineer

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,209
lead at one of the largest
healthcare company in United States.

5
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:18,349
Let me talk briefly about my experience.

6
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:22,689
So over the past several years I
have worked at the intersection

7
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,339
of data analytics, healthcare
systems, and automation.

8
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:32,559
So today I'm truly excited to share
how advanced analytics and artificial

9
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:38,459
intelligence or transforming clinical
robotics and the future of healthcare.

10
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:45,934
In this session we will walk through how
data and a are shaping healthcare's next

11
00:00:45,934 --> 00:00:53,064
frontier from from precision diagnosis
and robotic surgery to ethics, compliance,

12
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:55,684
and patient centered innovation.

13
00:00:55,984 --> 00:01:01,304
By the end I hope you all see
that e and robotics are not just

14
00:01:01,304 --> 00:01:07,944
technologies but they are instruments
of compassion, precision when

15
00:01:07,944 --> 00:01:11,004
built and trust and data integrity.

16
00:01:11,254 --> 00:01:13,924
Let's move forward and see how it works.

17
00:01:14,434 --> 00:01:16,344
So let me move to second slide.

18
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:20,474
So let's talk about a, let's talk a
little bit about abstract and overview.

19
00:01:20,954 --> 00:01:24,084
So let's begin with a quick
overview of what's that?

20
00:01:24,144 --> 00:01:25,674
What's this transformation look like?

21
00:01:26,064 --> 00:01:33,744
So healthcare today is moving rapidly from
reactive to prior to models of care, fuel

22
00:01:33,744 --> 00:01:37,594
by data analytics and a power insights.

23
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,634
So we call this as a data
driven evaluation of healthcare.

24
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:49,180
Imagine a system where every heartbeat,
scan and record isn't just stored,

25
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,790
but learn from the real time.

26
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:57,820
So our unified framework brings
together SaaS analytics, mission

27
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,250
learning, and robotics systems.

28
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:05,260
So forming a single ecosystem
like that, that suppose predictive

29
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,579
maintenance, precise diagnostics,
and continuous improvements.

30
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:15,940
But this evolution also requires a
strong ethical foundation as well, right?

31
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,649
So we have to ensure that all the
government regulations and, P-H-I-P-I

32
00:02:20,649 --> 00:02:26,049
data security, and then HIPAA and
GDP are compliance, transparency,

33
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:30,979
and explainability because healthcare
because in a healthcare trust

34
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:33,589
is the ultimate currency, right?

35
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:34,744
Yeah.

36
00:02:34,744 --> 00:02:36,844
So that's what we are
going to talk about today.

37
00:02:36,994 --> 00:02:39,574
So let's move on to next one.

38
00:02:40,304 --> 00:02:41,684
The healthcare transformation.

39
00:02:42,184 --> 00:02:45,454
So let's talk about the larger
transformation happening

40
00:02:45,454 --> 00:02:46,724
in healthcare currently.

41
00:02:47,324 --> 00:02:52,644
So we are witnessing a paradigm shift
from treating specific illness too,

42
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:55,404
predicting and then preventing it.

43
00:02:55,824 --> 00:02:59,334
So this shift is powered
by a data explosion, right?

44
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:04,984
So now we now collect the data
from multiple sources from amazing.

45
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,399
Genomics and then wearables, the
wearable devices, and then IOT devices

46
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:15,619
and electronic health records, and an
incredible multimodal data set that

47
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,709
can completely redefine how how how
we understand the health overall.

48
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:25,174
And but here is a challenge that
the integration is very challenging

49
00:03:25,174 --> 00:03:29,394
here because all of this data
lives in a different systems that

50
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:31,614
don't always talk each other.

51
00:03:32,604 --> 00:03:38,364
So connecting clinic, clinical robotics
with AI analytics, but requires a

52
00:03:38,364 --> 00:03:40,614
robust interoperability framework.

53
00:03:40,674 --> 00:03:47,099
That means we have to make a. Seamless
channel or connection between all

54
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:52,279
these sources to talk each other
and bring the data with the, in

55
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:53,989
a near real time or real time.

56
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:59,299
So that, the clinical robotics will
take a decision based on the the

57
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:01,189
collective data from all the sources.

58
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:04,254
So when we achieve this when
we achieve that connection,

59
00:04:04,734 --> 00:04:06,114
we can reduce medical error.

60
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:11,614
And then accelerate diagnosis
and enhance both patient outcomes

61
00:04:11,674 --> 00:04:14,284
and overall quality care as well.

62
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:18,234
So let's let's move on to how
the, actually the clinical

63
00:04:18,234 --> 00:04:19,854
robotics evolution happened.

64
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:25,704
Let's step back then, let's let's talk
about let's step back in time and see how

65
00:04:25,704 --> 00:04:32,874
clinical robotics has evolved In the 1980s
and 1990s systems like the Puma five 60

66
00:04:32,904 --> 00:04:39,024
and later, the Daven c surgical system
transformed minimally in VA surgery.

67
00:04:39,524 --> 00:04:45,834
They showed us that emissions could
enhance a human precision in the, in 2010.

68
00:04:46,374 --> 00:04:51,894
Robotics center, diagnostics and
rehabilitation, helping stroke patients

69
00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:56,894
regain mobility and supporting the re
procedures with a high year accuracy.

70
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:03,934
So by 2020, AI driven, robotics begin,
stepping in nearly every domain like

71
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:08,314
a surgery, pharmacy, automation,
elderly care, and hospital logistics.

72
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:14,684
Now we are entering, in a era
called, I call it a integration era.

73
00:05:15,044 --> 00:05:20,864
So where robotics data connects
directly with the patient analytics

74
00:05:20,864 --> 00:05:26,734
to enable closer loop care means
like a system where feedback and

75
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:28,924
action continuously improve outcomes.

76
00:05:29,424 --> 00:05:31,284
That's, that, that's important here.

77
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:32,694
When it comes to the integration area.

78
00:05:33,194 --> 00:05:34,634
So let's move back.

79
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:34,905
Sorry.

80
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:38,605
Let's for move forward and see
how AI and mission learning in

81
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,825
healthcare really, play a works.

82
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:45,469
So by touching all the key important
points, like a deep planning models,

83
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:49,459
how the deep planning models work and
neural language, sorry, natural language

84
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:51,409
processing and the predictive analytics.

85
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:54,139
And then, reinforcement learning, right?

86
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:56,569
And then finally, now
the precision medicine.

87
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:00,039
So let's talk about each
concept in a very high level.

88
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:04,619
So deep learning models can now
detect disease and CT scans.

89
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,379
MRIs and pathology slides
faster than faster and more

90
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:11,879
accurately than ever before.

91
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:11,969
Right?

92
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:14,120
And natural language processing.

93
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:20,030
So our visualization, NLP usually allow
us to extract insights from doctor

94
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:27,214
notes and unstructured text turning free
flowing narratives into structural data.

95
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:30,914
Then let's, and then
move to predictive model.

96
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:35,114
Predictive analytics helps us
detect sepsis, heart failures

97
00:06:35,614 --> 00:06:37,324
or infections before they come.

98
00:06:37,484 --> 00:06:41,904
Become a critical it's about
moving from cure to prevention.

99
00:06:42,294 --> 00:06:44,784
So then let's talk about
the reinforcement learning.

100
00:06:45,264 --> 00:06:48,474
So it, it is being applied
to a robotic surgery teaching

101
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:49,909
robots to adjust their movement.

102
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:54,699
Based on the outcomes, much like
a human lens through the feedback.

103
00:06:54,949 --> 00:07:00,029
And then we have a precision medicines
where ai analyze all the genetic

104
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:05,789
genetic data to design a personalized
therapies for each patient based on

105
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:09,979
its condition and many other factors
specific to that particular patient.

106
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:10,789
And then condition.

107
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:15,289
So this is how we move forward,
truly individualized healthcare.

108
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:20,440
Yeah, so I like to say here in the
past, doctors treated patients in the

109
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,159
future, the data will help doctors
know their patients well before

110
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:28,579
they even arrive to the, visit.

111
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,599
Yeah, that, that's all that's all about
the AI mission learning and healthcare.

112
00:07:33,544 --> 00:07:36,809
In this in this slide, and then
let's move forward to the evolution

113
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:38,329
of healthcare analytics framework.

114
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,899
Has robotics and ai matured?

115
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:44,919
Our analytics frameworks
evolved alongside them.

116
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:50,379
So like we started with a, descriptive
analytics, simply reporting what happened.

117
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:53,879
Basic descriptive analytics is
nothing but take all the existing

118
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,184
un historical data and what we have.

119
00:07:56,634 --> 00:08:00,445
In what our databases or in our
systems, and then just simply

120
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:02,434
reporting what happened, right?

121
00:08:02,855 --> 00:08:05,164
Then predict two analytics
came into the picture.

122
00:08:05,214 --> 00:08:10,824
So predictor analytics means like applying
some statistical models on top of what

123
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:15,684
on the top of the data that we have right
now in our system, and apply some mission

124
00:08:15,684 --> 00:08:18,174
learning algorithms to forecast outcomes.

125
00:08:18,594 --> 00:08:22,584
So now we are entering into the
era of prescriptive analytics.

126
00:08:22,989 --> 00:08:24,099
Descriptive is done.

127
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:25,959
Analytics, predictive is done.

128
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:32,329
And then now prescriptive analytics
means recommending what actions to

129
00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:38,479
take next based on predictive insights
that we have, predictive analytics,

130
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,829
and we have insights from that.

131
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:40,589
And then now.

132
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:46,209
Use this, by using this ai LLMs you can
just based on the predictor insights,

133
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:49,679
you can just recommending what kind
of, actions and, course of treatment

134
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:52,999
that we can design for the specific
patients and specific, conditions.

135
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:58,899
This shift is covered by a realtime data
pipelines, like using tools like a Kafka

136
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:04,619
spare and then Hadoop alongside advanced
modeling platform such as vo right.

137
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:09,259
And together all these tools enable
continuous intelligence where

138
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:14,754
analytics doesn't just analyze, but
it acts on the facts of the data.

139
00:09:15,469 --> 00:09:19,309
And when we visualize in dashboards
and KPIs, key performance indicators,

140
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:24,779
these insights empower clinic
clinicians directly bringing

141
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,609
data from the server room.

142
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:33,099
Server room means the data from all
the source systems to the bedside means

143
00:09:33,609 --> 00:09:37,824
where actually patient and and the
doctor actually, treats the patient.

144
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:42,879
So he has everything right now, next
to the patient and the next to the bed.

145
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:49,799
So the doctor's nurse, you don't
have to really go research, by diving

146
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:53,939
into multiple data sources and then,
take a call based on that or data.

147
00:09:53,939 --> 00:09:59,169
But that AI and the system will really
do it for the doctor so that they

148
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:03,160
can just quickly take a call and take
a decision and then, by providing

149
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,920
some prescriptive NLA, on treatment.

150
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,730
So let's move on to.

151
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,970
So proposed framework.

152
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:16,460
So what we are trying to propose
here, so let's talk about the five

153
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,820
layer architecture that brings
all these components together.

154
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,515
So we are divided into different
layers, like a data equation

155
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,420
layer, processing layer, yeah.

156
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:31,640
And analytics layer, and then
integration layer, and then presentation.

157
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,200
So let's talk about each.

158
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,970
So data equation layer collects inputs
from robotics or electronic health

159
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:45,160
records like EHS and iot sensors,
devices, and emerging systems and

160
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,510
all other devices, what are all
medical devices Processing layer.

161
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,470
So processing layer converts this
raw data, whatever we getting

162
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,140
from all the devices and what we.

163
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,180
In this processing layer is basically
like we consider the data from all these,

164
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:08,020
systems and then we convert this raw data
into structure and usable information.

165
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,030
Excuse me.

166
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,630
And then the next layer is
like AI and analytics layer.

167
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:19,360
So where mission learning and predictive
models turn the data into inside, right?

168
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:23,460
We have a structured and usable
information from the presentation layer.

169
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,410
Now we apply the all these AM models
in this analytical layer and where

170
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,060
mission learning and predictive models.

171
00:11:30,765 --> 00:11:33,825
The statistical models
turn data into insights.

172
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:36,595
They give, oh yeah this is
what the data shows tells us.

173
00:11:37,285 --> 00:11:38,455
And then this is the information.

174
00:11:38,455 --> 00:11:39,085
You have it.

175
00:11:39,595 --> 00:11:41,745
And then, then but still, right?

176
00:11:41,745 --> 00:11:44,075
Those are like a no
independent data points.

177
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:46,475
Now integration comes into the picture.

178
00:11:46,535 --> 00:11:48,215
That's why we call as a integration layer.

179
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:51,815
So APIs and middleware, right?

180
00:11:51,815 --> 00:11:55,685
And application interfaces and the
middleware ensures that interoperability

181
00:11:55,685 --> 00:12:01,065
across the systems we have all the data
points, data, source data objects, right?

182
00:12:01,065 --> 00:12:02,590
And then you need to integrate.

183
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,480
All the, data from different systems like
I sensor systems, scans and everything.

184
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,415
And then the move, the
data has to be collaborate.

185
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,545
Move between each systems and
then, collectively give make

186
00:12:15,545 --> 00:12:17,035
some kind of summarized insights.

187
00:12:17,545 --> 00:12:20,215
With that data that's
called integration layer.

188
00:12:20,715 --> 00:12:21,825
Now presentation layer.

189
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:27,055
So when we have all the data yeah,
integrated data and provides provides

190
00:12:27,055 --> 00:12:33,085
the dashboards alerts and patient support
directly to the clinicians, right?

191
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:37,865
And together these layers form
a unified ecosystem creating

192
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:43,400
end-to-end automation and delivering
insights the at the point of care.

193
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,810
So let's move on to let's move on
to the data pipeline architecture.

194
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,840
So this slide this slide shows how.

195
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,740
How that architecture looks in motion.

196
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,680
And first Apache Kaka, we,
let's talk about some technical

197
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,000
technical components here.

198
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:04,735
First Apache Kafka streams, robotic
telemetry and patient vital in real time.

199
00:13:04,805 --> 00:13:09,990
Apache Kafka, really streams, flows,
sensor data almost in real time.

200
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,700
Like a patient vitals or robotic er,
whatever, robotic tools actually,

201
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,370
performing at the point of time.

202
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,620
And then it talks to the patient vitals
at the same time, and then Apache Kafka.

203
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:25,220
So process these data streams
across the distributor cluster.

204
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,910
And then usually we have a huge
amount of data so for faster

205
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,840
processing or accessing, we, dis,
distributed into different clusters

206
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,490
for the parallel processing.

207
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,960
So these Apache spa process,
all these, cluster data.

208
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,090
Very fast.

209
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,370
And then next to Hadoop, HDFS, actually
Hadoop, HD FS is the file system storage.

210
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:51,110
Excuse me, the structured and
unstructured data securely.

211
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,520
So HDFS has the capability of storage,
like even structured, unstructured,

212
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,170
and, we can use we can implement proper
governance on those data elements.

213
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,530
Now let's talk about the SaaS wire.

214
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,130
SaaS wire.

215
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,840
It's it's an analytical tool, right?

216
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,990
I mean it's it adds analytical power
power to that data which resides

217
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:15,550
on the HDFS and then visualization
forecasting and predictive modeling.

218
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:22,480
And finally, HHL seven and FHIS
standards ensures interoperability

219
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,730
with hospital EHR system, right?

220
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,110
That's is interoperability like.

221
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:30,190
Communication between all
these different data points.

222
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,550
They ask for health electronic
health record system.

223
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:39,405
So together, together this pipeline
entire, the pipeline allows a low latency

224
00:14:39,405 --> 00:14:41,795
decision making in robotics workflow.

225
00:14:42,185 --> 00:14:42,640
So meaning.

226
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:48,105
Meaning like a clinical rewards
can respond to changing conditions

227
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:50,355
within a millisecond, right?

228
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,705
When we read the data in real time, when
we stream the data in real time, when

229
00:14:54,705 --> 00:14:56,855
we have the data, updating, almost in a.

230
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,165
In real time.

231
00:14:58,585 --> 00:15:03,385
So robotics should be able to capture
those updated, vital or, whatever

232
00:15:03,385 --> 00:15:07,905
that data patient data that come flows
through and should take an action

233
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:12,685
should, guide the patient doctors
almost like a, instantaneously.

234
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:16,375
So that's, that, that's what
another final goal is here.

235
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:21,490
So with another, the robots
should respond in milliseconds.

236
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,180
In essence, this is the digital
nervous system of a modern healthcare.

237
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,610
Okay, let's talk about mission
learning infrastructure, right?

238
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,510
When to make AI truly operational.

239
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,720
We need the right infrastructure now.

240
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,660
Yeah, we talked about different, software
components and, different pieces of

241
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:47,640
technology, how it works and how it really
integrates the data and it provides the

242
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,520
interoperability interoperability feature.

243
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:55,605
But in order to make you know all this to
work, we need the right infrastructure.

244
00:15:56,255 --> 00:16:00,955
That's where the automated ML lifecycle
covers automated Emission Learning

245
00:16:00,955 --> 00:16:04,525
lifecycle basically covers the data
preparation, featured selection,

246
00:16:04,945 --> 00:16:09,655
and then date model training and
validation, all seamlessly automated

247
00:16:09,655 --> 00:16:13,015
to save time and without any bias.

248
00:16:13,795 --> 00:16:17,535
And a hybrid cloud setup it's like
a hybrid, like you have an on-prem.

249
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,250
You have a better control over all
the go, data and governance applying

250
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:27,210
some securities and, control access
to specific PHI and PI data to

251
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:31,635
the limited, very secure people,
secure, I mean in a secure way.

252
00:16:32,085 --> 00:16:36,205
And, and then when it comes to
the cloud the cloud gives you the

253
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:40,405
opportunity either, what you call
them mean cloud actually help you to

254
00:16:40,405 --> 00:16:45,615
scale the product ally or vertically,
based on your need, based on your

255
00:16:45,615 --> 00:16:49,425
data, based on your processing power,
you can scale up and scale down.

256
00:16:49,935 --> 00:16:52,635
So there a s and does, it
comes into the picture.

257
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:56,635
So basically like an hybrid
architecture, you can secure the data.

258
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,575
You can, scale the scale, the product.

259
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:05,135
That's how a we hybrid cloud setup
and obviously GPU cluster, right?

260
00:17:05,135 --> 00:17:09,805
The GPU clusters enable, deep
learning models to understand

261
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:13,735
the images and medical images
like container medical images.

262
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:15,775
It requires a lot of, computational power.

263
00:17:16,345 --> 00:17:19,265
So here the GPUs actually works very well.

264
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:23,095
For the, to learn, to understand
and, know deep, take a deep dive

265
00:17:23,095 --> 00:17:24,565
into the medically amazing things.

266
00:17:25,135 --> 00:17:27,085
And then now container is deployment.

267
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:29,355
Container deployment is
nothing but irrespective of

268
00:17:29,355 --> 00:17:30,735
the operating system, right?

269
00:17:30,735 --> 00:17:35,525
And underlying operating system, the tool
and the product should work seamlessly

270
00:17:35,735 --> 00:17:38,260
because they're like nowadays the, there.

271
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,790
Infrastructure and underlying operating
systems are sh should not really,

272
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,950
limit the CAPAs limit the capability
of the product that you're building.

273
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:51,970
So that here, the containerized and
deployment ensures the flexibility

274
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,970
across multiple, across environments.

275
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,110
Now models are continuously
monitored for a drift.

276
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,940
Models are continuously monitored
for drift fairness and performance.

277
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:03,770
Okay.

278
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,025
And then, and when Drift is
detected retraining pipelines

279
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:08,255
automatically kicks in.

280
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:12,825
So some of the key algorithms in play
right include CNNs, like a convulsion

281
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:17,025
net natural networks sorry, convulsion
neural network for image recognition

282
00:18:17,475 --> 00:18:21,815
and recurrent neural networks, RN
for patient time series prediction.

283
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,815
And the transformers for clinical text.

284
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:28,605
And then reinforcement
learning for robotics control.

285
00:18:29,205 --> 00:18:35,465
This synergy enables the real time
adaptability where robots and algorithms

286
00:18:35,855 --> 00:18:40,105
keep learning, not just, working and
that they should, train themselves.

287
00:18:40,195 --> 00:18:43,015
They should keep learning and
then in keep working for us.

288
00:18:43,515 --> 00:18:48,125
Okay, so let's move on to
data governance compliance.

289
00:18:48,245 --> 00:18:48,515
Of course.

290
00:18:48,565 --> 00:18:53,345
With all these intelligence comes
responsibility and so in healthcare,

291
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:58,115
data governance and compliance
are non-negotiable at any cost.

292
00:18:58,815 --> 00:18:59,595
Very important.

293
00:19:00,255 --> 00:19:04,290
And that our systems implement
HIPAA controls including role-based

294
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:09,370
access like a ES 2 56 encryption
algorithm and full audit logging.

295
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,610
And we align with JDPR principles such as
consent tracking and privacy by design.

296
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,200
And of course, line know security
architecture involves multifactor

297
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,980
authentication and multifactor
authentication and network

298
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,625
segmentation and what we call
that now, intrusion detection.

299
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:33,305
And we maintain a data integrity
through metadata cataloging and linear

300
00:19:33,425 --> 00:19:36,335
tracking and data quality qua scoring.

301
00:19:36,835 --> 00:19:40,465
Ultimately this builds a chain of trust.

302
00:19:40,855 --> 00:19:46,775
Ensure like every data point is traceable
and then ethical and then transparent.

303
00:19:47,275 --> 00:19:48,625
Makes sense, right?

304
00:19:48,865 --> 00:19:53,505
And as often tell my team that
in healthcare, like data doesn't

305
00:19:53,505 --> 00:19:57,455
just need to be accurate, it
needs to be accountable as well.

306
00:19:57,955 --> 00:19:58,945
That is most important.

307
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:00,315
Hope I understand that.

308
00:20:00,675 --> 00:20:00,885
Yeah.

309
00:20:00,885 --> 00:20:03,115
So let's talk about next
clinical applications.

310
00:20:03,415 --> 00:20:06,535
So you know, some practical
application, look at some practical

311
00:20:06,535 --> 00:20:10,625
applications right in He enhanced
AI enhanced robotic surgery.

312
00:20:11,255 --> 00:20:16,065
The workflow is divided into
three stages, like a pre operator,

313
00:20:16,845 --> 00:20:18,735
in operator and post operator.

314
00:20:19,235 --> 00:20:27,095
So ai creates a three DR one maps that
helps surgeons plan every incision

315
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:29,405
with a millimeter position, right?

316
00:20:29,405 --> 00:20:34,275
That is very important because some of
the organs are very sensitive and very

317
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:37,965
minor, so it has to be the incision.

318
00:20:38,025 --> 00:20:40,045
It has to be very accurate.

319
00:20:40,765 --> 00:20:41,660
And then intraoperative.

320
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:47,240
Real time tissue classification
guides decision during surgery.

321
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,840
When the surgery happening, right?

322
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,000
The real time tissue
classification when you.

323
00:20:51,705 --> 00:20:56,555
When you put some incision on any
of the tissue and that that, that

324
00:20:56,885 --> 00:21:02,655
particular tissue need to be the robo
tick the component that, that is doing

325
00:21:02,655 --> 00:21:09,065
the operation the robotic operation,
that has to read, understand the

326
00:21:09,575 --> 00:21:12,255
understand the tissue classification.

327
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:17,205
What this tissue is and how it
reacts when we do an incision.

328
00:21:17,205 --> 00:21:20,565
And then how it actually, works and
how it actually bleeds and everything

329
00:21:20,565 --> 00:21:25,915
you need to, the robotic that should
robotic tool should understand this

330
00:21:25,965 --> 00:21:30,135
tissue classification and then guides
the decisions during the surgery.

331
00:21:30,435 --> 00:21:34,315
So it has to happen always
like a human right When doctor,

332
00:21:34,315 --> 00:21:35,725
when surgeon cuts a tissue.

333
00:21:36,225 --> 00:21:38,505
He knows what that tissue
is and how it works.

334
00:21:38,895 --> 00:21:42,055
And then, if something, she finds
something unusual, he should take a

335
00:21:42,055 --> 00:21:44,955
take call here and he should take a
decision and, he has to change the

336
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:47,115
course of surgery or maybe, do something.

337
00:21:47,655 --> 00:21:50,985
So in the same way, like we
expect the robotics, should do

338
00:21:50,985 --> 00:21:52,595
here in this situation as well.

339
00:21:53,195 --> 00:21:53,710
Then postop.

340
00:21:54,365 --> 00:21:59,465
Predictive models actually track
recovery and identity communications

341
00:21:59,555 --> 00:22:00,755
early complications early.

342
00:22:01,055 --> 00:22:04,295
So this predictor, we do right,
predictive means like applying some

343
00:22:04,295 --> 00:22:08,315
statistical models on top of what
we know, what we have right now.

344
00:22:08,825 --> 00:22:11,480
And then basically it tracks
it, track the recovery and

345
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,200
identify the complications like.

346
00:22:14,075 --> 00:22:14,225
Early.

347
00:22:14,275 --> 00:22:14,605
Okay.

348
00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:14,845
Yeah.

349
00:22:14,845 --> 00:22:20,675
This surgery this surgery gives more
complications in this particular area.

350
00:22:21,035 --> 00:22:22,955
So we cannot simply guess it, right?

351
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:26,795
And take the data based on historical
surgeries, similar kind of surgery,

352
00:22:27,395 --> 00:22:31,265
what happened, and and then what are the
complications and, and then apply some

353
00:22:31,265 --> 00:22:33,905
static statistical models and that data.

354
00:22:34,295 --> 00:22:37,130
And then, and then compare
it with the current surgery.

355
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,120
And then, then comes up with some kind
of, recommendations and saying that, hey,

356
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:48,050
this surgery or this post operation, these
are the, these probably these are the,

357
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:52,960
complications may arise and then, guide
the doctor and then treatment the patients

358
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,390
through doctor that, the post operator.

359
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,960
So these innovations have
reduced to operator times by 23%.

360
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,910
And then complications by
almost, one third like, and

361
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,560
then beyond the surgery, right?

362
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,690
And he also supports predictive
maintenance forecasting robotic component

363
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:18,410
failures with the, over 90% of accuracy
and reducing downtime by nearly 40%.

364
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:22,780
And finally, now, patient
risk satisfaction, right?

365
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,710
Satisfaction.

366
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:30,190
Patient stratification, like where
digital time as scoring helps hospitals

367
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:35,660
to prioritize, high risk patients
to and allocate resources smartly.

368
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,370
But that, that, that's yeah.

369
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,170
So that, that, that's a key here, right?

370
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:39,950
That, that's it.

371
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:44,790
This helps total hospital
admin, administration and to

372
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,560
control the resource wastage.

373
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:51,545
And also right person, right treatment the
critical person gets a treatment for us.

374
00:23:52,145 --> 00:23:57,205
So each of these use cases demonstrates
that when analytics meets robotics.

375
00:23:58,015 --> 00:24:01,315
We don't just treat patients faster,
but we, we treat them better.

376
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:06,495
Let's move on to, let's move
on to emerging technologies.

377
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:12,915
The next frontier lies in four kind
of technologies, for for powerful

378
00:24:12,915 --> 00:24:14,865
technologies, quantum computing.

379
00:24:15,365 --> 00:24:20,165
Edge computing, fer learning,
and finally explainable ai.

380
00:24:20,665 --> 00:24:20,755
Right?

381
00:24:21,055 --> 00:24:25,915
And then so let's talk about all these all
these that powerful technologies, quantum

382
00:24:25,915 --> 00:24:32,455
computing will revelation, revolutionize
the genomics, drug discovery, and

383
00:24:32,455 --> 00:24:37,675
molecular simulations by processing
massive dataset at quantum speed.

384
00:24:38,175 --> 00:24:44,665
Edge computing will push AI closer
to where the care happens besides

385
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:49,790
bedside phases or even insert surgical
robotics, really surgical robotics,

386
00:24:50,645 --> 00:24:53,665
reducing latency, and improving privacy.

387
00:24:54,655 --> 00:24:56,695
Now federated federated learning.

388
00:24:57,025 --> 00:24:59,700
So we enable hospitals across the globe.

389
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,510
To train a models together
without sharing sensitive data.

390
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,200
So a perfect balance of,
collaboration and privacy.

391
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,260
And finally, explainable tools
like, SHA and know Lyme health

392
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:19,670
clinicians understand why and made
a particular decision building.

393
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,730
Trust and transparency, right?

394
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,770
The clinician, that's
the most important thing.

395
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:27,140
They should understand why this
particular large language model or

396
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:31,440
some kind of together them really take,
made this kind of particular decision.

397
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:36,210
So that I know you can just try to, build
that trust, build that model output,

398
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:40,860
and also you can in a better position or
surgeon in a better position to explain to

399
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:45,620
the patient why they actually, that, that
kind of decision has been taken here and

400
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:52,550
these emerging technologies or extending
scalability, collaboration, and plus

401
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,985
across the entire healthcare ecosystem.

402
00:25:55,485 --> 00:25:59,535
Let's move on to challenges
and limitations, right?

403
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:03,885
So now it's very important to
be honest with you about the

404
00:26:03,885 --> 00:26:05,405
challenges what we face here.

405
00:26:05,975 --> 00:26:11,925
So from technical standpoint inconsistent
data quality, interoperability gaps,

406
00:26:12,465 --> 00:26:15,195
and high computational cost remains bad.

407
00:26:15,195 --> 00:26:16,995
Yes, no doubt about it.

408
00:26:17,915 --> 00:26:21,625
Because the data comes
like a, anything now.

409
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:25,775
So many variables, so many
iot devices, so many, systems.

410
00:26:26,555 --> 00:26:29,425
Every system sends the
data in its own way.

411
00:26:29,815 --> 00:26:36,005
And decoding the data and, understanding
and then making more, usable data.

412
00:26:36,005 --> 00:26:36,935
It is very challenging.

413
00:26:37,265 --> 00:26:39,515
And that is called,
interoperability gaps, right?

414
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:42,085
You get this data from here, you
get this data from, you get this

415
00:26:42,085 --> 00:26:45,515
data from here, and then you need
to you need to make sure that you

416
00:26:45,515 --> 00:26:49,075
know all the data data points are.

417
00:26:49,615 --> 00:26:56,145
Should be should be, understand in a
way that makes sense to other systems.

418
00:26:56,715 --> 00:27:00,195
Bringing the right point of data
from each system and, understand

419
00:27:00,195 --> 00:27:02,015
the data in a, meaningful way.

420
00:27:02,435 --> 00:27:06,305
And in order to do that, like it
requests a lot of computational

421
00:27:06,305 --> 00:27:07,595
power, computational cost.

422
00:27:08,495 --> 00:27:13,795
So means lot of gpu, a lot of, kind of
CPU power and lot of, things like that.

423
00:27:13,795 --> 00:27:16,425
Cause a bit of more comparatively.

424
00:27:16,925 --> 00:27:20,265
Keeping all the systems separately, right?

425
00:27:20,295 --> 00:27:23,005
That it has advantage, but
it has, some cost involved.

426
00:27:23,395 --> 00:27:24,955
So that is one challenge.

427
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:29,965
And the organizationally we face
clinicians' resistance often.

428
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,905
That, that makes sense
too, because like you.

429
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,170
Human no one.

430
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:38,640
As at this point, I don't think any
mission can really be the human brain

431
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,340
in, when it comes to take a decision.

432
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,980
And then when you call when do
something that is, you humans can feel

433
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,400
the thing, not the admissions, right?

434
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:50,310
I mean that, so that clinicians.

435
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:56,910
Can resist to, accept some changes
and often due to workflow changes.

436
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:59,340
And then we need to widespread upscaling.

437
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:03,735
That, that requires some kind of,
training and adaptability is required.

438
00:28:04,305 --> 00:28:07,745
And then there are ethical
concerns now, algorithm bias,

439
00:28:08,345 --> 00:28:14,165
black box decisions, and unclear
accountability in AI assisted outcomes.

440
00:28:15,155 --> 00:28:15,875
It's always there.

441
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:21,125
Every new thing, new technology always
have there you some kind of know concerns.

442
00:28:21,935 --> 00:28:26,395
And finally we have a regulatory and
clinical validation requirements.

443
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:30,325
Models must provide themselves
not just in theory, right?

444
00:28:30,325 --> 00:28:32,045
And, but in real world evidence.

445
00:28:32,345 --> 00:28:36,225
So it has to, prove that, okay,
this is not, I'm just, telling you

446
00:28:36,735 --> 00:28:40,125
or giving you the results, not just
based on the input that you provide.

447
00:28:40,155 --> 00:28:45,065
Now, these are the no real time
scenarios happen, different, cases,

448
00:28:45,065 --> 00:28:49,165
different patients and the different,
situations so that makes actually, more

449
00:28:49,165 --> 00:28:51,115
convincible and then more meaningful.

450
00:28:52,045 --> 00:28:54,295
So while the technology races ahead.

451
00:28:54,805 --> 00:28:59,815
Our responsibility is to ensure
empathy oversight and human.

452
00:28:59,855 --> 00:29:02,015
Judgment always remains at the center.

453
00:29:02,515 --> 00:29:02,815
Okay?

454
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:10,170
And then because no matter how smart AI
becomes, it must never lose a human touch.

455
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:11,635
This is very important.

456
00:29:12,135 --> 00:29:18,305
So the, let's move on to best
practices and recommendations.

457
00:29:18,605 --> 00:29:22,295
How do we move forward responsibly, right?

458
00:29:22,655 --> 00:29:28,295
And start with a small pilot project
always as we do and validate a clinically.

459
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:28,970
Yeah.

460
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,620
And then scale gradually.

461
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:36,140
So that's the way we do projects
are, the things everywhere, right?

462
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:40,675
Rather than just jump and do it,
large scale and, for all third user

463
00:29:40,675 --> 00:29:45,295
bases, we should slowly start small
and then go large and then adapt.

464
00:29:45,295 --> 00:29:51,165
All the standards like h Hhl seven FHAR,
and then API the first architectures for

465
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:55,845
interoperability and use hybrid cloud
models for flexibility and compliance

466
00:29:55,845 --> 00:29:57,375
as we talked in the previously.

467
00:29:57,885 --> 00:30:00,045
Cloud and, hybrid cloud
is very important here.

468
00:30:00,805 --> 00:30:05,785
And then implement continuous
monitoring for fairness and bias, right?

469
00:30:06,085 --> 00:30:10,865
Create ethics committees and, and
data steward stewardship roles to

470
00:30:10,865 --> 00:30:17,995
ensure the accountability and most
importantly keep clinicians, engineers,

471
00:30:18,385 --> 00:30:20,515
and patients in the same conversation.

472
00:30:21,465 --> 00:30:25,575
Because if I talk something, I mean as an
engineer, if I talk something, clinicians

473
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:30,975
may not understand and what clinicians
talk, I cannot understand fully.

474
00:30:31,695 --> 00:30:36,065
And patient, he cannot understand
what we are talking, and

475
00:30:36,065 --> 00:30:38,185
it has to be very the more.

476
00:30:38,685 --> 00:30:43,155
Layman kind of conversation when
it comes to now patient, right?

477
00:30:43,515 --> 00:30:46,695
You should understand and everyone should
understand like what we're talking about

478
00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:52,145
because that is a collaboration must
is a real backbone for this innovation.

479
00:30:52,645 --> 00:30:52,885
Okay.

480
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:58,775
And and then let's talk about
conclusion and future vision.

481
00:30:59,125 --> 00:30:59,155
Okay.

482
00:30:59,655 --> 00:31:02,565
As we look ahead I want to
leave you with this vision.

483
00:31:03,405 --> 00:31:09,485
So the convergence, the convergence
of air robotics, AI robotics and

484
00:31:09,485 --> 00:31:17,345
analytics is the most transformative
trial triad in modern healthcare.

485
00:31:18,035 --> 00:31:23,375
So we are entering an era of
predictive, personalized, and.

486
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:25,095
And participatory care.

487
00:31:25,575 --> 00:31:31,855
So where the medicine becomes proactive,
not reactive, the future includes

488
00:31:31,855 --> 00:31:37,735
quantum AI for genomic discovery, edge
robotics for remote telemedicine, right?

489
00:31:38,075 --> 00:31:42,005
And federated ai like for
global collaboration, right?

490
00:31:42,425 --> 00:31:47,315
And then, but above all, it's about
keeping healthcare patient centered

491
00:31:48,185 --> 00:31:53,915
guided by empathy, transparency
and ethical responsibility.

492
00:31:54,725 --> 00:31:59,735
So let's, so let's build a system that
just, that don't just, process the data,

493
00:31:59,915 --> 00:32:04,355
but truly understand the people behind it.

494
00:32:04,955 --> 00:32:09,355
And as I like to say, the stethoscope
defined in 19th century medicine.

495
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:13,070
Data and the AI will
define the 21st century.

496
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,410
Thank you all.

497
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:21,250
Thank you all so much for listening,
and I look forward to, c other,

498
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,840
presentation in this conference.

499
