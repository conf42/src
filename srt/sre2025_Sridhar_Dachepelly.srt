Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:02,420
Good morning.

3
00:00:02,689 --> 00:00:06,170
Today I will be discussing how
blockchain technology is pathed to

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,640
revolutionize tested data integrity
and compliance management across

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,030
regulated industries like healthcare,
finance, and pharmaceuticals.

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,309
Let's get into that one.

7
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,349
In 2023, global spending on
regulatory complaints reached

8
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:22,539
a strategy $8.7 billion.

9
00:00:22,569 --> 00:00:28,180
Additionally, the average cost per
data breach instant is $4.35 million.

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:34,150
Since 2020, there has been a 56%
increase in data integrity requirements.

11
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:39,894
Organizations is regulatory industries
face increasingly complaints,

12
00:00:40,015 --> 00:00:41,815
complex complaints, landscapes.

13
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:46,795
The financial burden is substantial
with complaints, costs continuing to

14
00:00:46,795 --> 00:00:49,675
rise annually beyond direct costs.

15
00:00:49,795 --> 00:00:53,664
The reparation damage from complaints,
failures can be devastating.

16
00:00:54,385 --> 00:00:57,410
Meeting the requirements
of regulations like hipaa.

17
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:04,250
Sarbanes Oxley and FDA 21 CFR Part 11
demands sophisticated approaches to

18
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,110
data management that the traditional
systems struggle to provide efficiently.

19
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,800
So core feature of blockchain.

20
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,020
Blockchains core features are
immutability, decentralization,

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,370
and smart contracts.

22
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:23,080
These can significantly enhance data
security and operational efficiency

23
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,180
in these high stakes environments.

24
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,550
Immutability ensures that once data is
recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted.

25
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,540
Providing a reliable audit
trial decentralization

26
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,520
reduces the risk of signal.

27
00:01:37,285 --> 00:01:42,505
Single pint of failure and hanahans
data security and distributing

28
00:01:42,774 --> 00:01:44,515
data across multiple nodes.

29
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:49,135
Smart contracts, automate
complaints processes, ensuring

30
00:01:49,135 --> 00:01:52,915
that regulatory requirements are
met without manual intervention.

31
00:01:53,415 --> 00:01:57,955
So how blockchain technology will
work in the healthcare industry.

32
00:01:58,455 --> 00:02:04,095
Organization face unprecedented data
management challenges with patient data

33
00:02:04,095 --> 00:02:07,054
doubling approximately every 73 days.

34
00:02:07,445 --> 00:02:12,125
The industry processes over 5.2
petabytes of sensitive information

35
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:17,430
daily, all of which must comply with
HIPAA and other regulatory frameworks.

36
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:18,990
Blockchains.

38
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,339
97% success rate in maintaining
data integrity and have reduced

39
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:33,289
unauthorized access attempts by 96 1%.

40
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:37,820
These improvements directly translate
to better patient outcomes, reduced

41
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,880
compliance costs, and minimize
risk of regulatory penalties.

42
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:46,390
Blockchain technology is
proving to be essential in

43
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,070

00:02:59,795 --> 00:03:03,395
Traditional complaints methods
involve manual audits, which are

48
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:05,075
high cost and time intensive.

49
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:08,285
However, with block blockchain
implementation, we can leverage

50
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:12,515
smart contracts and distributor
ledgers to streamline this process.

51
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:18,800
Organizations in financial sector
has been early adopters of blockchain

52
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,830
for complaints management, and
the results have been impressive.

53
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:27,050
They have reported a 72.8%
decrease in complaints related

54
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:31,875
costs, and compared to traditional
systems, perhaps more significant.

55
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:37,895
Is the 86.3% reduction in data integrity
incidents, which has dramatically

56
00:03:37,895 --> 00:03:41,825
decreased the risk of regulatory
penalties and reputational damage.

57
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:46,865
These improvements stem from blockchain's
ability to create immutable audit

58
00:03:46,865 --> 00:03:50,915

to overcome these challenges and achieve
successful integration Immutable.

115
00:07:44,109 --> 00:07:44,889
Audit trails.

116
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:50,589
So how blockchain technologies in
blockchain technology when you use the

117
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:54,639
blockchain technology, how the audit
trail audit trails are, how auditing

118
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,629
will help the blockchain technology when
you are implementing in your industry.

119
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:02,579
One of Blockchain's most valuable
compliance feature is its ability

120
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:04,349
to create immutable audit trails.

121
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:09,239
Every data transaction is recorded with
cryptographic proof of what change, who

122
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,459
changed it, and when the change occurred.

123
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:16,304
This level of detail creates unprecedented
transparency for auditors and regulators.

124
00:08:16,804 --> 00:08:19,804

data integrity across the network.

127
00:08:26,914 --> 00:08:32,074
Secure storage data is stored in
a tamper proof blocks linked to

128
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:35,164
cryptographically authorized access.

129
00:08:35,664 --> 00:08:38,514
Permission access is controlled
through smart contracts.

130
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:40,554
Audit verification.

131
00:08:40,764 --> 00:08:43,974
Complete history, accessible
to author, authorized, audited.

132
00:08:44,544 --> 00:08:49,944
So unlike traditional database logs, which
can be altered, blockchains distributed

133
00:08:49,944 --> 00:08:54,834
consensus mechanism ensures that the audit
trail itself cannot be tampered with.

134
00:08:55,104 --> 00:08:59,364
