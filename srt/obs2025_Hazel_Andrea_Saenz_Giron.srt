00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,040
Hi everybody.

2
00:00:01,369 --> 00:00:04,370
My name is Jason Z. I'm
so happy to be here.

3
00:00:04,399 --> 00:00:05,270
Thank you for joining today.

4
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:09,300
Session Today we're gonna talk about
about measuring the performance

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,770
of servers application with
generative A models and Amazon bed.

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,959
My name is Hazel Science
and I am from Guatemala.

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,999
I am an AWS serverless hero.

8
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,219
I am really passionate about se talking
serverless all the time, so you can find

9
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:33,785
me in AWS community Days Summits and all
text related events in Latin America.

10
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:34,475
And.

11
00:00:34,775 --> 00:00:40,115
I'm also the creator of q virtual
assistant that helps and try

12
00:00:40,115 --> 00:00:45,005
to revolution how is the way
that we are learning about AWS.

13
00:00:45,905 --> 00:00:52,265
So I write also technical articles, so
if you want to go and see my content

14
00:00:52,475 --> 00:00:55,475
and or even just connect with me to.

15
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:57,095
Talk about several desk.

16
00:00:57,095 --> 00:00:58,535
Please follow me on my media.

17
00:00:58,565 --> 00:01:01,025
This is the, I leave the QR in here for.

18
00:01:01,025 --> 00:01:04,175
You can follow me and I'll
be glad to talk to you.

19
00:01:04,835 --> 00:01:06,035
So let's get started.

20
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:12,245
What we are going to learn today, because
there was a really fancy table in the.

21
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,980
Talk today, but what is really what
we want to learn here, so I don't know

22
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:23,780
about you, but when I started to learn
about GAI, like a couple of years back

23
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:29,880
I started to test all the different,
models that come to the market, right?

24
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,570
Like everybody else, I started testing
and when I start evaluate them, I

25
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,080
see the publicity and say something
like this in the image in here.

26
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:45,159
So in all the ads they create,
like I want an image that can say

27
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:47,889
this about an eye, for example,
and create something like this.

28
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:48,909
And what's so awesome?

29
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:50,349
So I say, oh, this is great.

30
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:51,009
I wanna test this.

31
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:58,210
But when I started to test it, I realized
that my image, it wasn't exactly the same

32
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,899
as the ad. I didn't know that happened
to you, but it happened to me a lot.

33
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,119
And I was really frustrated and skinny.

34
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:09,529
Something like this, like I have a
character with three mouths instead

35
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:15,769
of one and, or sometimes even I
have more hands or more legs than

36
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,089
a character or something like that.

37
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:21,570
I just started thinking about I want
to build application with Gen ai.

38
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,880
Not only that, right?

39
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,700
For me, but actually
use it in my business.

40
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:34,675
So it's supposed to be easy and
straightforward, and they never

41
00:02:34,675 --> 00:02:38,024
should fail and sound easy, right?

42
00:02:38,415 --> 00:02:40,965
But for some reason it wasn't.

43
00:02:41,465 --> 00:02:43,655
So why so hard?

44
00:02:43,894 --> 00:02:50,945
When I started to actually build and
incorporate this different tools on it,

45
00:02:51,394 --> 00:02:58,325
I realized that, and I learned that with
Gene AI application, it is different

46
00:02:58,414 --> 00:03:01,605
about where we are used to work before.

47
00:03:02,105 --> 00:03:02,345
Why?

48
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:09,115
Because in my previous systems related
with banking e-commerce and all the

49
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:15,775
different kind of application, all
that program were deterministic.

50
00:03:16,255 --> 00:03:17,275
And what is that?

51
00:03:17,575 --> 00:03:23,875
That means that when I send an input,
I always get the same output because

52
00:03:24,175 --> 00:03:27,745
the logic inside the program, it was.

53
00:03:28,495 --> 00:03:29,785
Like a bunch of ifs.

54
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:33,655
Let's say if I, you give me
a one, I will return you.

55
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,590
The word yes.

56
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,800
If you give me a two, I
will return you the word no.

57
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,080
So every time that I say one, I'm
gonna have the same answer, and

58
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,290
every time I say two, I'm gonna
have exactly the same answer.

59
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,980
So everything is the
same one and over again.

60
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,920
But now is different.

61
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:01,000
With Gene AI application, we have
a pro, a program that is based in.

62
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:02,635
Probabilities.

63
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:07,675
It is probabilistic
what this concept mean.

64
00:04:08,035 --> 00:04:14,185
That means that I can have
the same input over and over

65
00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:18,495
again but my output may change.

66
00:04:18,915 --> 00:04:19,365
Why?

67
00:04:19,695 --> 00:04:25,395
Because the models were actually
going to give you as an answer

68
00:04:25,575 --> 00:04:28,485
is based about the probabilities.

69
00:04:28,515 --> 00:04:30,555
That could be the right answer.

70
00:04:30,555 --> 00:04:35,670
I. So the models have so much
information that they not always

71
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,050
going to return you the same.

72
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,440
Probably a hundred percent.

73
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:47,420
Ask the same question and the model
know that 98% of that that users like

74
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,055
what one kind of question they're
gonna provide you that answer.

75
00:04:52,385 --> 00:04:52,745
Yeah.

76
00:04:53,245 --> 00:04:55,075
But it's probably not the one you want.

77
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:01,480
Because you could be the 2% that it
wasn't looking that answer, right?

78
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:09,510
That's why is more difficult to actually
create an application that give you,

79
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,430
that, provide to the users the output that
you want based on probability, and that

80
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,950
opens a new door for me when I started to
actually build this kind of application.

81
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,040
Said.

82
00:05:22,715 --> 00:05:24,665
Okay, now I know the problem.

83
00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:30,705
I know why so hard and evaluate
a little bit in more details.

84
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:37,425
So now that I know that my previous
application was deterministic, that

85
00:05:37,425 --> 00:05:41,925
I know that is fixed result, that it
depends on fixed rules because it's was

86
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:45,935
a bunch of it, is it always the same?

87
00:05:46,435 --> 00:05:51,475
So I know what it works
in my previous projects.

88
00:05:51,865 --> 00:05:55,565
An example of this, it could
be like a binary search and all

89
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:58,355
that kind of application that
is already out there, right?

90
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,915
But prob probabilistic.

91
00:06:01,575 --> 00:06:02,925
I don't have fix the result.

92
00:06:03,465 --> 00:06:08,025
I don't have the same rules all the time.

93
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:13,725
It depends about, not only about what is
the outcome that I want, it's about what

94
00:06:13,755 --> 00:06:19,185
the model that I'm used, because each
model is trained with different data.

95
00:06:19,635 --> 00:06:23,415
So the output that can provide
me there are different.

96
00:06:24,045 --> 00:06:30,975
So now I have a new variable that I need
to consider what model I actually I do

97
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:33,855
need in my business for actually can.

98
00:06:34,365 --> 00:06:36,825
Get the output that I need, right?

99
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:42,275
And it may vary each time
that I ask the same question.

100
00:06:42,275 --> 00:06:45,665
So if I have a hundred user,
then I send the same question.

101
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,185
I'm not always going
to get the same answer.

102
00:06:48,185 --> 00:06:52,165
So what kind of examples
are the can I have in here?

103
00:06:52,165 --> 00:06:58,275
What I have all the ML models like
Amazon, Nova Cloud chapter bt.

104
00:06:58,775 --> 00:07:00,635
Every model is different.

105
00:07:01,265 --> 00:07:05,735
Every model processed
information differently and

106
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:08,345
collects different kind of data.

107
00:07:08,435 --> 00:07:12,845
So that's why their outputs change.

108
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:19,845
So if I still do want to have application
with Gene ai, because I do, because.

109
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,140
I need to have it in my business
to actually grow and take all

110
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,580
the capabilities that Gene AI
offers to me into my business.

111
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,730
What should be my goal?

112
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:38,930
How can I knowing that I have this
kind of challenge, can I face it?

113
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,390
So the first thing that we
need to understand is what

114
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,760
are the AI objectives because.

115
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,990
It is important to be aware of
that in a business decision.

116
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,890
So the first one, I want quality.

117
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,330
I don't want to have an
image with three mounts.

118
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:02,750
I want that my output, they always have
in the high quality that the user needs.

119
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,450
My user needs, right?

120
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,130
So that's an important fact.

121
00:08:07,925 --> 00:08:08,645
The second.

122
00:08:08,975 --> 00:08:12,395
The second one is I want
the best performance.

123
00:08:12,605 --> 00:08:16,205
I don't know if this happened to
you, but I use some of these tools

124
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:22,415
and when I create in one model,
I get the answer really fast.

125
00:08:22,505 --> 00:08:27,545
And when I test the other one, it
was more slow that the previous

126
00:08:27,545 --> 00:08:32,185
one, and maybe it's the lowest
and the quality is not that good.

127
00:08:32,755 --> 00:08:35,235
So which one should I use?

128
00:08:35,735 --> 00:08:38,285
Was the faster right and the best quality.

129
00:08:38,335 --> 00:08:44,065
But it comes to, into a balance
because you don't only want that

130
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:49,975
new application be a hundred percent
accurate all the time, but I want to,

131
00:08:50,185 --> 00:08:55,735
this application should be fast because
I don't want my users go to the author.

132
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:59,335
To the other company to get
the information that I want

133
00:08:59,335 --> 00:09:00,505
to provide them, right?

134
00:09:00,895 --> 00:09:02,635
And for that I need to be fast.

135
00:09:03,055 --> 00:09:05,635
So performance is really important here.

136
00:09:06,175 --> 00:09:12,965
And the other one that is maybe not
that impactful to the users but is

137
00:09:12,965 --> 00:09:16,985
impactful to my business is that
there needs to be cost effective.

138
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:22,175
So I want to have that this
application have high quality.

139
00:09:22,865 --> 00:09:28,685
We need to have best, the best performance
into the in the market, but I also.

140
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:37,430
Need to be careful with my prices because
with my cost itself, because gen AI is

141
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,400
expensive, the model use is expensive.

142
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:46,880
So I need to be wise when I select
what model should I use, and I

143
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,670
need to be aware that maybe I don't
need such intelligent models for

144
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,890
some tasks, but for others I do.

145
00:09:55,685 --> 00:09:57,995
So I need to learn how to balance that.

146
00:09:58,295 --> 00:09:58,595
Okay.

147
00:09:59,045 --> 00:10:04,475
And with that, if I get the three,
these three key objectives, I'm going to

148
00:10:04,475 --> 00:10:09,355
create a fully good gen AI application.

149
00:10:09,835 --> 00:10:10,195
Okay.

150
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:14,635
So to get here, we need to
understand what are the building

151
00:10:14,635 --> 00:10:17,545
blocks that CON consists on?

152
00:10:17,845 --> 00:10:18,925
General applications.

153
00:10:19,225 --> 00:10:19,375
No.

154
00:10:19,975 --> 00:10:22,045
Because it is a little different.

155
00:10:22,595 --> 00:10:26,945
If you have experience creating another
kind of application, like a e-commerce

156
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:31,015
application or a banking application
with g ai is a little different.

157
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:34,665
And this is why, this is the
blocks that we have to start.

158
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:37,005
We have the confidential model hub.

159
00:10:37,545 --> 00:10:43,305
This part of the application,
it, it has the communication.

160
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,330
Of the models itself.

161
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,930
So what models are you going
to use in your application?

162
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,680
Because in some cases we
want to build our own model.

163
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,120
In other cases, we're gonna use the
one that we already have in the market

164
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,630
and it's, that is good, but this
is the phase when you decide that.

165
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:00,230
Okay.

166
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,710
The second part is the data foundation.

167
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:04,940
Do you remember that?

168
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,640
I said that all the models has.

169
00:11:08,285 --> 00:11:11,315
Different outputs because
the data is different.

170
00:11:11,525 --> 00:11:13,475
So in your business is the same.

171
00:11:14,435 --> 00:11:20,585
I can have business that it provides
the same service, that another 10

172
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:26,345
company, but it's mine is gonna be
different because my data is different.

173
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:31,865
It provides something new to the
users and that is why this other

174
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:36,415
layer is really important, because
depends on the quality of your data.

175
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,800
Your application, the quality of
your application will be different.

176
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,990
The third layer is about
model adapting and prompting.

177
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,000
And this is something really important.

178
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,300
We, you can have the data that you
need, you can select the best model

179
00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:00,860
you can, but if you don't know what
is the right prompt to use that model.

180
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,120
You will probably will
not get the best results.

181
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:12,000
So this is the point when prompt
engineering is come to the game

182
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,220
and start changing the things.

183
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:14,670
Okay?

184
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,225
The other part is Gene AIOps.

185
00:12:17,725 --> 00:12:23,785
You already know what the true layer basic
of a of an A gene application, right?

186
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:32,305
But to actually have a successful
application running with different cycles

187
00:12:32,305 --> 00:12:38,215
of deployment, you need to get in place,
your software development lifecycle,

188
00:12:38,485 --> 00:12:41,185
and that is this part of Gene AI Ops.

189
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,704
How are you going to
deploy that application?

190
00:12:44,035 --> 00:12:49,215
You are gonna use a infrastructure as
a code for that all that kind of stuff.

191
00:12:49,215 --> 00:12:53,685
And what is the continue, did you gonna
have into different versions and all that?

192
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:59,895
And something that is important and we
cannot forget about that, is that you

193
00:12:59,895 --> 00:13:04,245
already have probably, you already have
some application with your clients.

194
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:08,505
They already know, and they are familiar
how this application's going to be

195
00:13:08,505 --> 00:13:12,285
connected to your new application
that is powered with gene ai.

196
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:17,415
So that is the other block that
we need to take in consideration.

197
00:13:17,915 --> 00:13:24,875
And this part, and to this point, we
know what are the components that are

198
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,245
part of a good gene AI application.

199
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:27,845
Okay?

200
00:13:28,415 --> 00:13:31,015
But we need to add something else in here.

201
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:35,935
We need to keep in mind that if you
gonna have this kind of application, you

202
00:13:35,935 --> 00:13:40,375
need to have in place a good government
and you need to have the country plan.

203
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:41,980
What is that?

204
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:47,050
You need to be aware about your user,
what kinda access they can have,

205
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:52,660
what the security you gonna have
in your application to not be be

206
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,220
attacked and all that kind of stuff.

207
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:00,520
But counterplan, it's gonna be the
one they can help you to improve

208
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,840
your application into the future.

209
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:04,620
Okay.

210
00:14:05,385 --> 00:14:05,745
Why?

211
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:10,635
Because it's open this world that
has been called observability and

212
00:14:10,635 --> 00:14:16,755
it allows you to actually, you can
monitor what is going on in all the

213
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:19,065
different blocks that I disrupt for.

214
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:19,755
Okay.

215
00:14:20,255 --> 00:14:27,675
And for the last layer then the last
block that we're gonna have in here is

216
00:14:27,675 --> 00:14:29,835
not that it's not important because it is.

217
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:33,815
All the infrastructure that is
running below this application

218
00:14:33,815 --> 00:14:35,975
that it make it to actually work.

219
00:14:36,185 --> 00:14:40,855
So in this session, we're going
to see, and we're gonna focus

220
00:14:40,855 --> 00:14:42,385
only in these three blocks.

221
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,905
We are gonna focus in the
foundational model hub.

222
00:14:44,935 --> 00:14:48,895
How do the models actually, we
can collect information from

223
00:14:48,895 --> 00:14:52,165
them and all the data foundation.

224
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:52,765
Okay.

225
00:14:53,755 --> 00:14:55,015
And we're gonna talk about.

226
00:14:55,105 --> 00:14:57,325
Observability And why observability?

227
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:03,245
Because if we want to have this, the
three objectives of this applications,

228
00:15:03,245 --> 00:15:08,615
the quality, the cost, and the
performance, we need to be, before we

229
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:15,995
can decide what we use, we need to be
aware what we need, how our application

230
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:19,625
is being, how is working behind.

231
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,850
Because with each interaction, I can
learn about it and I can improve it.

232
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:30,400
For the gene I application,
this is the key factor.

233
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:37,060
If you don't observe what is going on
in your application, you can improve it.

234
00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:43,065
So you're probably gonna be left behind
because the other companies, they

235
00:15:43,065 --> 00:15:47,025
are watching their own application
and they're improving itself.

236
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:49,905
In some cases, they're gonna
take the decision about, I'm

237
00:15:50,175 --> 00:15:52,095
going to change the model.

238
00:15:52,455 --> 00:15:53,625
I'm going to change.

239
00:15:53,905 --> 00:15:55,645
I'm going to improve my prompting.

240
00:15:55,675 --> 00:16:00,085
I'm going to change my data because
I'm not providing the data that I need.

241
00:16:00,415 --> 00:16:05,335
That kind of decision needs to base
on numbers and numbers is going to be

242
00:16:05,335 --> 00:16:08,035
provided to you using observability.

243
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:08,865
Okay.

244
00:16:09,855 --> 00:16:12,915
This is an example about what
is a foundational model health

245
00:16:13,185 --> 00:16:15,285
like in a high level, right?

246
00:16:15,495 --> 00:16:19,665
You can have a gene application and
you're gonna have a gene AI gateway

247
00:16:19,695 --> 00:16:25,905
that is going to be the point of access
for all your gene AI components that

248
00:16:25,905 --> 00:16:28,215
is gonna be part of their application.

249
00:16:28,815 --> 00:16:34,065
That could be like, you can use
models in Amazon Bedrock, for example.

250
00:16:34,635 --> 00:16:36,525
Or you can create your own models.

251
00:16:36,735 --> 00:16:37,395
You remember that?

252
00:16:37,395 --> 00:16:38,505
I said you can have those.

253
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:39,705
Yeah, you can have both.

254
00:16:40,185 --> 00:16:44,605
You can choose to have your own
model created from scratch, or you

255
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:48,415
can start using the tools that is
already in the market like Amazon

256
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:53,335
better that it provides you the comp,
the capability to, you can use the.

257
00:16:53,710 --> 00:17:01,140
Other models out there from
Cloud for yeah, Tropic Lama Nova.

258
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,930
You can use all that models just
by using the Amazon Metro, API, for

259
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:12,470
example, and in some way you can have
the benefit of all the different models

260
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:15,965
using just one language to do it right.

261
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:20,515
And the other part it was the
enhancement of data connotation.

262
00:17:20,845 --> 00:17:24,205
That is one example of that
is our wrap application.

263
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:30,395
So when you talk about gene AI project
applications, you need to put your data.

264
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:36,910
To this application for they can
answer or they can use it to train

265
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:41,890
and provide you outputs that you need
that will be custom to your clients.

266
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:46,380
So that's why it's so important
how you are going to provide that

267
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,730
information to the application.

268
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,435
And the rat comes up.

269
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:53,565
You can have ETL process.

270
00:17:53,565 --> 00:17:59,180
You can have applications
like Confluence, JIRA GitHub.

271
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:03,200
You can have a different input
that's going to provide that

272
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,480
information to your customers.

273
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:11,800
You can even have document PDF files,
c, s, B, files, whatever you need.

274
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,120
That is your data.

275
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:19,460
Even you can have APIs and you can have
databases that you need to provide that

276
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:26,000
information to your application for the
action can using to be trained, right?

277
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,660
So in here that comes to concept one,
the Amazon Belt drug knowledge base that

278
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,640
will allow you to have all the different,
files that I was mentioned before,

279
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:43,860
like easily get all that information
together, put it in a vector database,

280
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:50,070
and the models can actually use that
database to get the information right.

281
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,850
You can have actions, you can have
tools that you can incorporate in here.

282
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:02,090
But the main goal is to get your data
right and you can also have Amazon

283
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:06,320
bedroom Gogos that is going to be
the one that helps you to not only

284
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,690
have the information, but to protect
yourself and protect your data.

285
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,100
To be reading, read it, and mal intent.

286
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,375
For some of the users, for example,
what kind it, I don't know, but

287
00:19:22,005 --> 00:19:27,665
they can be like the informa, the
sensitive data from your customers.

288
00:19:27,755 --> 00:19:31,335
It's just something that you get in
your data, but you don't want that that

289
00:19:31,335 --> 00:19:33,975
application can have it or you don't want.

290
00:19:34,035 --> 00:19:34,335
Yeah.

291
00:19:34,665 --> 00:19:36,255
So you don't want your application.

292
00:19:36,615 --> 00:19:39,415
Another application can have that
information because it's protected.

293
00:19:39,655 --> 00:19:45,675
So you can do it with guardrail, okay, so
what are the key, what we need to follow

294
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:47,115
to actually implement observability?

295
00:19:47,955 --> 00:19:50,655
We need to have these
four layers in place.

296
00:19:50,805 --> 00:19:52,665
One, the company level.

297
00:19:52,935 --> 00:19:56,655
You need to have metrics
in your infrastructure.

298
00:19:56,655 --> 00:20:02,630
You need to have invocation errors,
latency utilization, because to order

299
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,620
to identify, to have a performance
issue, you should know how your.

300
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,780
Resources is performing.

301
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,000
So you need these metrics.

302
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,510
Yeah.

303
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,960
Layer two, you're gonna get
metrics from and the traces.

304
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:22,300
So when you work with models
you, the traces come be really

305
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,921
important because you need to know.

306
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:29,920
What actually is gonna happen when
the user asks for something and all

307
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,370
the different stuff that is related
with all the different components.

308
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,260
So this is why it came.

309
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:43,220
Important part layer three, the
metrics and analysis related to Gores.

310
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,730
How many how many users try to get
sensitive data for customer, how many

311
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,190
users can actually get trying to get.

312
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,180
Information about your cast or
something that is important.

313
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,330
That is something that you need to
keep an eye because you probably need

314
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:04,070
to change the way that your data is
being populated to, to your models.

315
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,000
And the fourth and last
one is the user feedback.

316
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:11,950
The user and feedback is important
because when you are interacting,

317
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,355
let's say like a chat bot.

318
00:21:14,135 --> 00:21:19,655
If the answer that provided to the
user it wasn't good enough, the

319
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:23,975
user can give you that feedback
and can say, yes, I, it was good.

320
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:25,715
I don't like it, I hate it.

321
00:21:26,135 --> 00:21:27,275
All of that kinda stuff.

322
00:21:27,425 --> 00:21:31,115
You can get it from there and you can
improve yourself because remember,

323
00:21:31,535 --> 00:21:36,185
each time you have an answer, it's
gonna be a different answer and

324
00:21:36,185 --> 00:21:41,355
could be a good one that satisfied
what the user need or can be another

325
00:21:41,355 --> 00:21:42,615
one that it doesn't do it at all.

326
00:21:43,155 --> 00:21:43,395
Okay.

327
00:21:43,695 --> 00:21:46,345
So that's why the before
layer is important.

328
00:21:46,735 --> 00:21:50,515
You can do it if you already have an
application, you can do it step by step.

329
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,255
So you can start step one.

330
00:21:52,255 --> 00:21:57,215
Then pro plan to have this layer two,
the layer three, and the level four,

331
00:21:57,575 --> 00:22:02,845
but the it is in this order because
it is important that you start to

332
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:06,175
do and you need to when you start.

333
00:22:06,675 --> 00:22:10,395
The science, your application, you
need to be aware that this is the road

334
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:15,345
that you must follow to actually can
have the most observability and the

335
00:22:15,345 --> 00:22:19,915
most decision data related, improve.

336
00:22:20,415 --> 00:22:23,265
And for this example, I'm
going to use Amazon CloudWatch.

337
00:22:23,515 --> 00:22:30,235
That is a service for AWS that is
used to collect all the, not only

338
00:22:30,235 --> 00:22:37,035
the logs, but also trace and collect
all the information from our s from

339
00:22:37,035 --> 00:22:40,095
the services that is involved in
this in this kind of application.

340
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:40,605
Okay.

341
00:22:41,105 --> 00:22:43,505
So with that, we can do it a demo.

342
00:22:43,685 --> 00:22:46,835
If you want to do it yourself, you
can do it, you can just scan this.

343
00:22:47,675 --> 00:22:49,055
I will try to give the link.

344
00:22:49,155 --> 00:22:50,715
But you can download in video.

345
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:57,735
I create a small application in GitHub,
and you can just download it, you can

346
00:22:57,735 --> 00:23:03,165
clone it, you can deploy it in your
own AWS account, and you can start.

347
00:23:03,735 --> 00:23:09,435
Just deploy it, use it, and start
to see the dashboard about how

348
00:23:09,435 --> 00:23:10,785
you are collecting the data.

349
00:23:11,235 --> 00:23:11,535
Okay.

350
00:23:11,585 --> 00:23:16,200
Okay, so let's take a look about the team.

351
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:21,950
Something that is important in here
is that, to actually, if you're going

352
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:26,030
to use some bad, you need to collect
your metrics and that is not at

353
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,470
the default picture that is turned.

354
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,420
You need to go and do it yourself.

355
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,560
I'm doing it in here really fast,
only to see how simple it is.

356
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,460
You can send it to a, an extra
bucket or you can send it directly

357
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,415
to, to cloud only to CloudWatch.

358
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:46,405
The target that you can have
all the different inputs that

359
00:23:46,465 --> 00:23:48,025
the models are actually working.

360
00:23:48,325 --> 00:23:52,705
So if you see here, I'm gonna, in
here in the example, you're gonna

361
00:23:52,705 --> 00:23:55,885
have an API that is a expert music.

362
00:23:55,885 --> 00:23:58,345
So you can ask it
anything about the music.

363
00:23:58,705 --> 00:24:05,235
And each time the user sent a question a
model is being indicate at the backend.

364
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:10,445
You will get the answer about
that question, and if you go to

365
00:24:10,445 --> 00:24:12,935
see now you, I turn off the logs.

366
00:24:13,445 --> 00:24:19,805
If you see here, you can get now
the information about that request.

367
00:24:19,895 --> 00:24:22,085
You will note what model was involved.

368
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:25,685
You can know what is the a, the
question that the user made, what

369
00:24:25,685 --> 00:24:30,755
is the answer that the model provide
and most, and really important, the

370
00:24:30,755 --> 00:24:32,915
token that's being used in here.

371
00:24:33,185 --> 00:24:37,355
It's gonna help you to get what
exactly the same, the cost that is

372
00:24:37,915 --> 00:24:40,585
is getting to you by using this.

373
00:24:41,185 --> 00:24:46,075
For example, if you want to compare to
a different model, you can have the same

374
00:24:46,075 --> 00:24:48,055
implication to two different models.

375
00:24:48,055 --> 00:24:52,850
You can count the tokens and you will
know which one was more expensive

376
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:57,440
or which one takes the longest
while the latency and all that.

377
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:01,070
And only like enabling that part.

378
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,100
Okay.

379
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,140
The other kind of of metrics is
the one you use with x-ray and

380
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:09,970
you use with CloudWatch, and
you use also with CloudTrail.

381
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:17,230
In this example I have in the Lambda, I
use a specific trace to actually can be

382
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:21,820
aware the timing that is consuming the.

383
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,920
All the different steps in the function.

384
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:28,750
And in the ripple you can see the
example and you will get the information

385
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:33,580
not only to the invocation, the
time that the Lambda takes to run,

386
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:37,515
but you will also know how long the
Lambda takes to execute the model.

387
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:41,585
And you will know the timing
of the metrics, for example.

388
00:25:41,945 --> 00:25:46,430
So in here, if you see if I can
go, if it can go to CloudWatch.

389
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:53,190
See the, now you are capturing all
the different locks in here and you,

390
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:58,620
we can go to x-ray because it is
instrumented to x-ray and you can see

391
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:04,170
that you're not only gonna get what
is the locks inside the Lambda, but

392
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,500
you also get this kind of diagram.

393
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:12,180
They show you what all
are, all the different.

394
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,670
Services in both to get that answer.

395
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:16,930
Okay.

396
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:22,175
So this is the cool part that you
have like different all is separate.

397
00:26:22,515 --> 00:26:26,615
You have the trace at the level
of the code that you need and

398
00:26:26,615 --> 00:26:31,385
you can go much deep as you like
and you need in your business.

399
00:26:31,415 --> 00:26:31,685
Okay?

400
00:26:32,495 --> 00:26:37,135
So what kind of the, lambda, I
recommend that I always have this,

401
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:40,955
the one that I use in the models
itself that is really important.

402
00:26:41,385 --> 00:26:43,845
The logs that you see in the
beginning about what's the

403
00:26:43,845 --> 00:26:45,165
answer to the models itself.

404
00:26:45,675 --> 00:26:50,715
And with that, you can also make
something really cool in, in cloud

405
00:26:50,865 --> 00:26:53,325
that is related with the dashboard.

406
00:26:53,565 --> 00:26:58,185
So by the fold, you can go
and create this dashboard.

407
00:26:58,185 --> 00:27:00,105
You only select that you want to have.

408
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,530
Like bedrock dashboard and you
will have the in implication

409
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,390
of the models, the input token.

410
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:10,800
And in here it, this kind provides
you a visual when you can have

411
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,560
the comparation between the
different model that you're using.

412
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,100
If you have, for example, like
10 models that you, you will

413
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,930
actually be able to see it.

414
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:18,990
Okay.

415
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:24,310
So this is only the implementation
of phase of layer one and

416
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,260
layer two for layer three.

417
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,050
That is part of the guardrails.

418
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:33,040
And number four, that
is an end user input.

419
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:38,030
I didn't have it in the demo, but
it's like the next steps that you can

420
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,730
have with this basic observability.

421
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,490
Okay.

422
00:27:41,935 --> 00:27:44,885
So with that I said I,

423
00:27:45,385 --> 00:27:47,260
so with that's all that I have.

424
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,120
Really thank you to be here.

425
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:52,350
I'm really, sLA to be part of.

426
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,740
With that, I am that will be all.

427
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,520
I'm really proud to be here in
this space, so let's connect

428
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,980
with me and have a nice day.

429
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,000
Thanks for watching.

430
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:03,480
Bye-bye.
