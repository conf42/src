1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,370
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,729 --> 00:00:04,460
Good morning or good evening,
depending on your location.

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:10,540
I am TU and I have 23 years of
experience in data engineering, AI and

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:16,884
a ML. Cloud Technologies, enterprise
bi, and in manufacturing industries.

5
00:00:17,215 --> 00:00:20,544
It is a pleasure to be here at
Platform Engineering Conference.

6
00:00:21,025 --> 00:00:25,584
Today I'm going to take you through
the journey of building scalable AI ML

7
00:00:25,584 --> 00:00:31,495
platform for industrial iot, specifically
through a cloud native approach for

8
00:00:31,495 --> 00:00:33,265
predictive maintenance infrastructure.

9
00:00:33,765 --> 00:00:39,615
This session combines of my 23 years
of experience in enterprise school data

10
00:00:39,615 --> 00:00:45,015
platform with real world lessons from
industrial transformation projects.

11
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:46,095
Let's get started.

12
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:48,815
Here is the agenda for today's conference.

13
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,170
The industrial iot landscape.

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,090
Challenges and opportunities evolving
from reactive to predictive maintenance.

15
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:01,940
The business use case for ai, ML
powered maintenance core architectural

16
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,610
patterns for iot platform success.

17
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,840
Cloud native platform
components for industrial iot

18
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,060
edge computing integrations.

19
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:16,010
ML Pipeline orchestration for predictive
maintenance developer experience,

20
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:20,600
enabling data science team case
studies for multi-site manufacturing

21
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:26,270
implementation roadmap, and key
takeaway for platform engineers.

22
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,920
The industrial IOT landscape,
challenges and opportunities

23
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,080
industrial iot has transformed how
manufacturing environment operates.

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,870
In industrial iot, we see 1.52,
2.3 data bytes of daily sensor

25
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:46,990
data is flowing from distributed
sites, each with mix of device.

26
00:01:47,545 --> 00:01:49,525
Protocol and requirements.

27
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:55,165
The opportunity here is huge, but
the challenges are from unifying

28
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:59,995
heterogeneous data stream to
meeting strict uptime requirement.

29
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:06,435
Our mission as a platform engineer is
to turn this raw data into actionable

30
00:02:06,435 --> 00:02:11,165
intelligence while keeping the
enterprise system reliability intact.

31
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:14,515
Evolving from reactive to
predictive maintenance.

32
00:02:15,265 --> 00:02:19,855
Here we have four types of maintenance,
reactive scheduled maintenance,

33
00:02:19,885 --> 00:02:21,385
conditional based maintenance.

34
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:23,845
Finally, AI driven predictive maintenance.

35
00:02:24,385 --> 00:02:26,275
Let's start with reactive maintenance.

36
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:30,865
Traditionally, reactive maintenance has
been fixing the things after they file,

37
00:02:31,465 --> 00:02:36,295
which needs more downtime and unplanned
production disruptions will cost you

38
00:02:36,295 --> 00:02:38,905
more than it came Schedule maintenance.

39
00:02:39,405 --> 00:02:46,005
Which is often meant fixing too early or
too late, which is also not best practice.

40
00:02:46,275 --> 00:02:48,345
Next is conditional base maintenance.

41
00:02:48,675 --> 00:02:52,035
Maintenance, which improve
the things, but still lack of

42
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:56,505
foresight and some limitations
are there in this method as well.

43
00:02:57,015 --> 00:02:58,725
The final only is AI driven.

44
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:01,515
Predictive maintenance
is the game changer.

45
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:03,885
It's giving you eight to 10.

46
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,860
12 days of advanced warning with
almost 90% prediction accuracy.

47
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:16,340
But to get there, we need infrastructures
that supports this evolution and

48
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,990
helps organizational changes both
technologically as well as culturally,

49
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,665
the business use case for AI
powered predictive maintenance.

50
00:03:25,215 --> 00:03:26,785
Here are the game changing results.

51
00:03:27,285 --> 00:03:28,425
Downtime reduction.

52
00:03:28,845 --> 00:03:35,655
Ines implementing AI driven maintenance
have reported 50% reduction in downtime,

53
00:03:36,165 --> 00:03:41,565
which is half the machine offline time
compared to before return on investment.

54
00:03:42,045 --> 00:03:47,715
Perhaps most impressive is
385% return on investment.

55
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:53,130
These projects don't just play themselves,
they multiply the value delivered.

56
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,210
Next is.

57
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,360
Predict prediction accuracy.

58
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:05,050
Model M and models can predict equipment
failure with 89%, 89.7% accuracy.

59
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,150
This means engineers and operators
can get clear, timely, alert.

60
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,770
The last is early.

61
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:17,920
Warning alert, these models can provide
eight to 12 days of advanced warning,

62
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,470
which is critical for planning downtime
and avoiding production disruptions.

63
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,150
This aren't just nice to have a metrics.

64
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:33,840
This trans, they translate directly
into operational and financial win.

65
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,210
That is why 60% of industrial
manufacturing or investing in

66
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,370
predictive maintenance platform.

67
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,260
Here.

68
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,290
The question is, how do
we build them at scale

69
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,330
core architectural pattern
for iot platform success?

70
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,950
It start with architectural
choice, multi-tier processing.

71
00:04:54,450 --> 00:05:00,390
Use edge device for quick real-time
decisions, and then use cloud for

72
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,880
deeper and more complex analysis.

73
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,980
Sometimes mix of both.

74
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:10,220
Hybrid is the best to balance
speed and heavy workloads.

75
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,600
Second is even driven architectures
instead of waiting in a line,

76
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,180
data is handled as even happens.

77
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,360
This lets systems smoothly manage
challenges, data volumes, and

78
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,550
unexpected, sudden surge of many
sensors, auto-scaling infrastructures.

79
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:33,610
Kubernetes driven elastic city
for peak loads, which means system

80
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,860
dynamically can scale up or scale
down to match the demand and workload.

81
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,370
The last one is distributed
storage strategies.

82
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,280
This keeps, data is different layer.

83
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:51,600
Hot storage for faster access to
real-time A and cold storage for

84
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,880
keeping older historical data used
in a training and long-term analysis.

85
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,575
These patents provide the backbone
of the scalable resilience platform,

86
00:06:02,075 --> 00:06:05,590
cloud native platform
component for industrial iot.

87
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,390
From ingestion to association,
every layers matters.

88
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,210
Let's start with data addition layer.

89
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:18,599
It connects machines and sensor using
standard protocol like O-P-C-U-A-M-Q-T,

90
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:26,360
and Modbus and stream streams data
with tools like Kafka and puls.

91
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,420
Next is storage and processing layer.

92
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:36,395
Source sensor data in time series database
and large scale data lakes like Snowflake

93
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:39,305
and Databricks ML orchestration layer.

94
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:46,475
It automates model training with tools
like Cube flow or ML flow, and manages

95
00:06:46,565 --> 00:06:48,935
reusable features in features stores.

96
00:06:49,435 --> 00:06:51,385
The last is application layer.

97
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:57,805
It provide graphical QL, API and
rest a PA for data access and powered

98
00:06:57,805 --> 00:07:00,295
real time dashboard with alerts.

99
00:07:01,015 --> 00:07:06,385
The key is loose coupling so that
each layer can evolve independently,

100
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,685
each computing integrations.

101
00:07:08,805 --> 00:07:13,275
Bringing AI to the source, one
of the most powerful enable.

102
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,170
Enabler here is edge computing.

103
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,680
Here are the some key
benefits of edge computing.

104
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:26,090
Critical alerts are handled up to
75 to 80% quicker only important

105
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,060
data is sent for reducing network.

106
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,000
Network load and bandwidth
systems keeps working.

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,090
Even if the internet connectivity
drops, press pre-processing edge.

108
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:42,460
We'll cut down the expense of cloud usage.

109
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,520
Next is platform engineer considerations.

110
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:51,760
Deploy ML model efficiently on the device
with limited memory and processing power.

111
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,840
Update edge device remotely
without manual inter intervention.

112
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:02,375
Ensure data is exchanged safely
using mutual authentication

113
00:08:02,434 --> 00:08:03,814
and secure communication.

114
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,640
Keep the data consistent between
edge device and the cloud.

115
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,370
Even unreliable connections.

116
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,500
Even with unreliable connections.

117
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,120
The ultimate goal is here, seamless
data flow between Edge and the cloud.

118
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,169
Cloud platform.

119
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:21,760
ML Pipeline orchestration
for predictive maintenance.

120
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,559
Predictive maintenance is not
just about the models, it is about

121
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:26,965
the full lifecycle development.

122
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:32,054
Start with data collections, gather
the real-time mission signals

123
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:38,174
such as vibrations, temperatures,
pressure, et cetera, from iot sensor.

124
00:08:38,595 --> 00:08:43,215
Second is processing clean,
normalize and extract meaningful

125
00:08:43,215 --> 00:08:45,195
patterns from raw sensor data.

126
00:08:45,975 --> 00:08:47,685
Third is train the ML model.

127
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:53,955
Use historical data to build algorithm
that predict occupant failures for this

128
00:08:53,955 --> 00:08:56,265
validation against real world failure.

129
00:08:56,985 --> 00:09:02,735
Test the model predictions against actual
breakdown events to ensure accuracy.

130
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:05,345
Fifth deployment into production.

131
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:09,805
Integrate the model into live
system for real time failure.

132
00:09:09,805 --> 00:09:11,725
Productions prediction.

133
00:09:12,225 --> 00:09:16,755
Last one is monitoring continuous,
continuously track the accuracy,

134
00:09:16,995 --> 00:09:21,735
data drift and retain when
the performance declines.

135
00:09:22,235 --> 00:09:26,390
Automation, observability and
governance needs to be built.

136
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:27,130
Every stage.

137
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,240
Developer experience
enabling data science team.

138
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,790
Data scientists should focus on
the model, not on the plumbing.

139
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:38,949
That means self-service infrastructure
give the data scientist on demand access

140
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:44,655
to scalable compute, storage and tools
without waiting on operation teams.

141
00:09:45,405 --> 00:09:48,774
Next is automated CICD for ml.

142
00:09:49,185 --> 00:09:53,949
Streamline the model development
with pipeline, that auto test version

143
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:56,415
control and auto deploy ML code.

144
00:09:56,915 --> 00:09:59,614
Last one is manage the feature stores.

145
00:10:00,244 --> 00:10:05,795
It provides centralized, reusable system
for consistent feature engineering

146
00:10:05,824 --> 00:10:08,194
across training and production systems.

147
00:10:08,694 --> 00:10:13,314
Yes, strong developer experience
accelerate adoption and productivity

148
00:10:13,314 --> 00:10:15,144
while maintaining the governance.

149
00:10:15,644 --> 00:10:19,904
Case studies, multi-site, multi-site
manufacturing implementations.

150
00:10:20,264 --> 00:10:25,064
Let me bring this to life with some
real time use case studies, a global

151
00:10:25,064 --> 00:10:29,685
manufacturer with 37 facilities
and 12 different equipment vendor,

152
00:10:30,104 --> 00:10:32,025
and a major downtime challenges.

153
00:10:32,504 --> 00:10:35,920
Our platform solution is
to use the hybrid cloud.

154
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:42,329
Which is AWS and Azure architecture,
snowflake analytics, cube flow

155
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:46,290
pipeline, and the custom adapters
Here are the end results.

156
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,550
43, 42 times 40, 42%.

157
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,670
Downtime reduction, 4.3 million.

158
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:59,430
Annual saving, 93% model deployment
success rate, and a 2.5 times

159
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,530
productivity boost for data science team.

160
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:07,250
Implementation roadmap for
platform evolutionary strategy.

161
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,060
We approach this in different phases.

162
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:15,380
First, to start with foundations,
it takes three to four months

163
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,189
of connectivity, building basic
pipeline, and data governance.

164
00:11:19,865 --> 00:11:24,635
Second ML deployment, it takes
two to three months for feature

165
00:11:24,635 --> 00:11:29,735
engineering training and initial
deployment scale and optimize.

166
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:34,865
This process takes four to six
months of edge integration, advanced

167
00:11:34,865 --> 00:11:37,295
automation, enterprise integrations.

168
00:11:37,715 --> 00:11:39,035
Last one is enterprise.

169
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,460
Expansion.

170
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:46,310
This is ongoing process platform as
a service offering multi-site ana

171
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,220
analytics and continuous evaluations.

172
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:54,410
This phased strategy delivers value early
while building towards full maturity.

173
00:11:54,910 --> 00:12:00,499
Here are some key for platform
engineers, architecture matters, design

174
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:06,050
end-to-end system that simultaneously
handle data from sensor to insight,

175
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:11,689
ensuring scalability, resilience,
and edge and cloud integrations.

176
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:16,479
Next is developer experience
drives adoption, provide a

177
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:18,219
simple and secure abstractions.

178
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:22,870
So that data science scientists
can focus on the models without

179
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,520
wrestling with infrastructure team.

180
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,660
Last one is incremental wins,
which means start small scale.

181
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,580
Small meaning begin with small,
which has a high return on investment

182
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:40,340
use case, and then scale globally
using model modular platform that.

183
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,480
Adopt to new needs and technologies.

184
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,590
The most successful platform aren't
just a technical achievement.

185
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,930
They are enabler of organizational
transformation from reactive

186
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,700
to predictive operations.

187
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,970
Thank you for time today.

188
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:01,650
I look forward for your questions
and discussions about how

189
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:05,970
we can shape the future for
predictive maintenance together.

190
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:06,955
See you later.

191
00:13:07,635 --> 00:13:08,205
Bye.
