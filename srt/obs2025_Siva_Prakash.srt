1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,249
Good morning.

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:02,510
Good afternoon, everyone.

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,640
My name is Siva Prakash.

4
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,350
It's a pleasure to be here.

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,360
With two decades in the IT industry,
I have dedicated the last four

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,550
years specifically to navigating the
intricate technological landscapes of

7
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:18,620
the financial and insurance sectors.

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,060
During this time, I have seen
firsthand the evolution of systems.

9
00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:27,395
The explosion of data and the
mounting pressure for absolute

10
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:29,075
reliability and security.

11
00:00:29,495 --> 00:00:33,905
Today I want to talk about a
transformative approach that addresses one

12
00:00:33,905 --> 00:00:36,365
of the most pressing issues in our field.

13
00:00:36,965 --> 00:00:40,805
Cloud native observability
financial institution are the

14
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:45,425
bedrock of our economy, processing
trillions of transactions annually

15
00:00:45,935 --> 00:00:47,675
through increasingly complex.

16
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:52,325
Distributed architecture, this
complexity while enabling innovations

17
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:57,125
being unprecedented, observability
challenges, the stark reality is

18
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:02,735
that traditional monitoring approach
often detect a mere one to two

19
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:05,345
percentage of critical anomalies.

20
00:01:05,615 --> 00:01:10,565
Think about that 98 percentage of
potential issues might be lurking, unseen.

21
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:13,775
This can and does lead to significant.

22
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:21,200
Downtime costs, customer dissatisfaction
and serious compliance viol violations.

23
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,500
But what if we could flip that statistics?

24
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,230
That's precisely what I'm here to discuss.

25
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,790
We will explore how cutting edge
cloud native observability solutions,

26
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,980
particularly those harnessing the power
of graph based topology analysis and

27
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:42,440
behavioral analytics, are fundamentally
changing financial systems monitoring.

28
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:50,735
We are aiming for and achieving up to 99.4
percentage accuracy in identifying system

29
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:55,985
anomalies while simultaneously making
a massive dent in operational noise by

30
00:01:55,985 --> 00:01:59,585
reducing false alerts by 87 percentage.

31
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:04,994
Let's spend a few moments dissecting
the current monitoring challenge because

32
00:02:05,324 --> 00:02:07,844
understanding the problem deeply is.

33
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,959
Appreciating the solution.

34
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,410
As this slide illustrates,
it's a multifaceted issue.

35
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,870
Number one, low detection rate.

36
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,370
I mentioned the alarming one to 2%
detection rate for critical anomalies.

37
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,500
Anomalies.

38
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,100
There is not just a statistics,
it is a significant business risk.

39
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,630
It means that by the time an issue
is manually discovered, it may

40
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,500
have already impacted customers
or critical financial processes.

41
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:37,864
Alert fatigue for the
anomalies that are detected.

42
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:42,635
Traditional system often vol,
they generate an excessive

43
00:02:42,635 --> 00:02:44,404
number of false alert positives.

44
00:02:45,304 --> 00:02:48,964
My colleagues in operation often
tell me they are drowning in alerts.

45
00:02:49,415 --> 00:02:51,214
This alert fatigue is dangerous.

46
00:02:51,364 --> 00:02:56,195
Critical alerts get missed because teams
are desensitized or simply overwhelmed.

47
00:02:56,695 --> 00:02:57,805
System complexity.

48
00:02:57,925 --> 00:03:00,205
Financial systems today
are no longer simple.

49
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:01,795
Monolithic application.

50
00:03:02,155 --> 00:03:06,295
They have evolved into incredibly
intricate webs of microservices,

51
00:03:07,015 --> 00:03:09,685
APIs, and distributed databases.

52
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,045
We are talking thousands
of interdependencies.

53
00:03:13,435 --> 00:03:19,075
Trying to manually map or understand this
with all tools is like trying to navigate

54
00:03:19,435 --> 00:03:22,915
labyrinth blindfolded financial impact.

55
00:03:23,215 --> 00:03:28,285
The direct consequence of this
shortcomings is significant.

56
00:03:28,785 --> 00:03:31,485
Downtime costs, but it's
more than just that.

57
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:38,865
It's reputational damage, loss of customer
trust, and the ever looming threat of

58
00:03:39,105 --> 00:03:41,385
regulatory penalties for non-compliance.

59
00:03:41,835 --> 00:03:45,345
So why are traditional tools failing us?

60
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:49,005
Predominantly, they rely on
threshold based monitoring.

61
00:03:49,635 --> 00:03:54,525
You set a static limit CP usage above
x percentage response time over y

62
00:03:54,525 --> 00:04:00,225
millisecond, but in a. Cloud native world,
these thresholds are often too rigid.

63
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:04,215
They don't understand the
content context or the complex

64
00:04:04,215 --> 00:04:05,565
relationship between the component.

65
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:10,814
This leads to those BL critical
blind spots and makes troubleshooting

66
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:16,789
are reactive, a resource intensive
and often frustrating process.

67
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:21,039
This brings us to our solution,
starting with a foundational

68
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:23,559
element, graph based ology analysis.

69
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,539
Imagine creating a dynamic
living and breathing blueprint

70
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:30,549
of your entire financial systems.

71
00:04:31,299 --> 00:04:32,409
That's what this is.

72
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,799
It's about understanding the
who, what, where, and how.

73
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:43,629
Your sensitive interactions, the process
unfold in logical steps, data collections.

74
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:48,789
First, we gather comprehensive
elementary, that include logs, detailed

75
00:04:48,794 --> 00:04:51,189
metrics, and distributed tracers.

76
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:55,769
From every single component in
your system, be it in a, be it

77
00:04:55,769 --> 00:05:00,299
an application, a microservice, a
database, or a piece of infrastructure.

78
00:05:00,929 --> 00:05:02,399
Number two, graph construction.

79
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:05,249
This is where the real
intelligence come into play.

80
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,169
We don't just collect data.

81
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:10,289
We use it to map out all
service dependencies and

82
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:11,879
their intricate relationship.

83
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:18,029
This construct, a graph model, a
visual and analytical representation

84
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:20,009
of your systems topology.

85
00:05:20,564 --> 00:05:24,014
Think of it like a social
networking for your services.

86
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:29,984
We see who took talks to whom, how
often, how politically pattern analysis.

87
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:35,114
With this dynamic graph, we can
analyze how services interact

88
00:05:35,114 --> 00:05:39,614
under normal condition, and more
importantly, identify behavioral

89
00:05:39,614 --> 00:05:42,224
patterns that deviate from this norm.

90
00:05:42,724 --> 00:05:44,494
Patterns that are anomalous.

91
00:05:44,824 --> 00:05:47,614
For instance, a service suddenly
trying to communicate with another

92
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:51,604
service it has never interacted with
before, or a critical pathway showing

93
00:05:51,994 --> 00:05:54,994
unusual latency, intelligent editing.

94
00:05:55,084 --> 00:05:59,794
This allows for highly targeted
notification because we

95
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:01,834
understand the relationship.

96
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:04,869
The alert come with rich
context, helping teams.

97
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:09,869
Understand the blast radius and
potential upstream downstream impact.

98
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,949
This also feeds into risk assessment,
helping prioritize issues.

99
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:19,349
The true power here, and I have seen this
make a huge difference, is its ability

100
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:24,419
to reveal those hidden connections and
dependencies that often go in notice.

101
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:29,519
This allows us to identify anomalies
that conventional detection methods with

102
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,729
their siloed views would invariably miss.

103
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:38,159
Sequently, we can precisely target
the root cause of issues rather

104
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:40,229
than just firefighting the symptoms.

105
00:06:40,619 --> 00:06:45,239
This shift from reactive to proactive
is a game change changer, especially in

106
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:50,399
preventing those fast escalating failure
that can ripple financial operations

107
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:54,294
hand in line with our graph
based apologies or behavior.

108
00:06:54,534 --> 00:06:58,549
And these frameworks, if the
graph tells us how components are.

109
00:06:59,034 --> 00:07:03,624
Interconnected Behavioral analytics
tells us how they should be behaving

110
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:07,074
within that structure and critically
when they start to deviate.

111
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:12,444
This framework is a continuous loop
number first metric collection.

112
00:07:12,534 --> 00:07:19,275
We are gathering over 300 different
system metrics in a real time

113
00:07:19,364 --> 00:07:20,684
from across your environment.

114
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:23,265
This provides a rich,
multidimensional view of.

115
00:07:23,765 --> 00:07:25,895
This is where it gets really smart.

116
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:29,614
The system does not rely on
predefined static thresholds.

117
00:07:29,794 --> 00:07:34,145
Instead, it uses machine learning to
establish normal operational pattern

118
00:07:34,145 --> 00:07:35,734
for your specific environment.

119
00:07:36,094 --> 00:07:39,844
Creating dynamic baseline that
continuously adapt to changing

120
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:41,554
condition and seasonality.

121
00:07:41,914 --> 00:07:45,695
What's normal on a Monday morning might
be different from a Friday afternoon

122
00:07:45,695 --> 00:07:48,215
during options expire, for example.

123
00:07:48,715 --> 00:07:50,844
Number three, contextual analysis.

124
00:07:51,114 --> 00:07:55,825
When deviation from this learned
baseline occur, the framework

125
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:57,864
evaluates their significance.

126
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:01,585
It considers the context what
else is happening in the system?

127
00:08:01,884 --> 00:08:04,224
How does this deviation relate to others?

128
00:08:04,465 --> 00:08:09,444
Is this a minor isolated blip or a
statistically significant pattern?

129
00:08:09,444 --> 00:08:12,494
That could be the early
warning sign of a larger issue.

130
00:08:12,794 --> 00:08:14,804
Number four, deviation detection.

131
00:08:15,524 --> 00:08:21,284
Based on the contextual analysis, the
system identify even subtle anomalies

132
00:08:21,284 --> 00:08:25,575
that might be indicative of potential
failure, often long before they would

133
00:08:25,935 --> 00:08:28,034
breach a traditional static threshold.

134
00:08:28,604 --> 00:08:31,634
The crucial differentiator
here is the move away from

135
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:33,555
those rigid static threshold.

136
00:08:33,885 --> 00:08:38,294
As I mentioned, static thresholds
often lead to a flood of false

137
00:08:38,294 --> 00:08:42,855
positives or conversely mis
emerging issues until it's too late.

138
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,069
Our behavioral analytics approach
by focusing on subtle deviation

139
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,660
from learn norms, achieve early
detection rate that are impressive.

140
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,160
5.3 times higher than typical
industry standard in my whole

141
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,780
years in finance and insurance.

142
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:03,749
Ability to get ahead of an issue to
detect it in fancy has consistently

143
00:09:03,749 --> 00:09:07,904
be been a key factor in maintain,
maintaining stability and trust.

144
00:09:08,404 --> 00:09:10,804
These are not just theoretical advantages.

145
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:16,114
The performance metrics speaks volumes
as you can see from this comparison.

146
00:09:16,384 --> 00:09:18,754
Let's first look at the
anomaly detection rate.

147
00:09:19,054 --> 00:09:24,694
Our solution represented by the
lighter bar achieves a 99.4%

148
00:09:24,694 --> 00:09:26,254
accuracy in detecting anomalies.

149
00:09:26,254 --> 00:09:29,664
Compare that to the very low single
digits of additional monitoring.

150
00:09:30,234 --> 00:09:31,404
That's a monumentally.

151
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,549
Now consider the false positive rate.

152
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:37,809
We have achieved an 87%
reduction in false alerts.

153
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:43,089
Imagine the impact on your operation
team, less noise, less wasted effort, and

154
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:47,229
the renewed ability to focus on genuine
issues that require their expertise.

155
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:52,009
This also the rebuilds plus in
the monitoring system itself.

156
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:56,689
Early detection, it is normally measured
in ours, is significantly enhanced.

157
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:02,389
This crucial lead time gives times a much
teams a much better chance to investigate,

158
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:06,709
mitigate, and resolve problems
before they impact users or escalate

159
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:12,169
into major incidents and critically
look at un unidentified failures.

160
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:16,849
There is a dramatic decrease
here translating to a 76.

161
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:21,439
Percentage increase in detecting
previously unidentified failure pattern.

162
00:10:21,499 --> 00:10:26,149
This means fewer unexpected outages,
enhanced system reliability, and

163
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:30,439
a more resilient infrastructure
Overall, this proactive discovery

164
00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:34,519
of unknown failure, more invaluable
for continuous improvement.

165
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:37,209
Financial systems are data factories.

166
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:43,569
They generate absolutely volumes
of tele data logs, metric prices,

167
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:45,514
often reaching data scale.

168
00:10:46,014 --> 00:10:49,494
Handling this sheer volume
efficiently is a significant

169
00:10:49,794 --> 00:10:51,444
engineering challenge in itself.

170
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:55,494
Slow processing or inefficient
storage can negate the benefit of

171
00:10:55,494 --> 00:10:57,594
even one, the smartest analytics.

172
00:10:58,284 --> 00:11:04,314
Our cloudnative platform is specifically
architecture to manage deluge effectively.
