00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,009
Hello all, thank,
welcome to con 42 python.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:09,599
I thank you for attending this session
and, I would like to go over some of the,

3
00:00:10,149 --> 00:00:15,929
use cases of python in, deep learning
and how it can help us in, building a

4
00:00:15,989 --> 00:00:20,870
lot of deep learning and data engineering
and these kinds of transformative apps.

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,830
And, let me first quickly give you
a short introduction about myself.

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:32,350
I have total experience of eight
plus years in machine learning, data

7
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,980
engineering, as well as cyber security.

8
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:40,229
I graduated from Northeastern
University with information systems

9
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,799
with specialization in machine
learning and data analytics.

10
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:48,599
So in this presentation,
we will dive deep into how.

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,230
Machine learning and deep learning
have enabled transformation and all

12
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,500
these applications, they are built
on Python using kind of packages

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,310
like TensorFlow, PyTorch and all
the other deep learning packages.

14
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,700
So let's go through this slide
over here, which illustrates

15
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,630
about reinforcement learning.

16
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,200
So as we, as we know, there are a lot
of capabilities in machine learning.

17
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,440
These are related to.

18
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,960
Supervised learning,
unsupervised learning.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,850
So these kinds of algorithms are
kind of very basic algorithms.

20
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:30,620
They are used widely in industries,
but right now reinforcement learning

21
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,620
is making a lot of inroads because
of a lot of good algorithms are

22
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,450
being developed on basis of that.

23
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,580
And these kinds of algorithms are
shaping the future and they are enabling

24
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,140
a lot of superhuman capabilities.

25
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,530
capabilities.

26
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,870
So these kind of reinforcement
learning they have once they are

27
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:54,810
trained in a very proper way manner
with less errors and higher accuracy.

28
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,550
These can lead to, you know,
building superhuman or, you know,

29
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,750
a deep brain kind of capabilities.

30
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,480
Like if you see chat, GPT and other LLM
models, they are generative and they

31
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,710
are able to Kind of do the thinking
and provide us with the answer.

32
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,600
So these kind of capabilities have
evolved through reinforcement learning.

33
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,930
For example, if you see DeepMind, AlphaGo,
then, recent breakthroughs in theory,

34
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,990
these have a lot of, reinforcement
learning involved, and these are shaping

35
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:32,180
the way for the future, especially
in robotics and various other fields.

36
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,660
Then we look into the
generative models over here.

37
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,770
So over here I have mentioned
about generative adversarial

38
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,780
national autoencoders.

39
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,610
So what is the difference between the two?

40
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:51,175
GANs are mostly generative models and
they are Kind of more of generation

41
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:56,395
image generation and that kind of thing
and they have They currently have higher

42
00:02:56,395 --> 00:03:03,375
accuracy as compared to VAEs, but VAEs are
more powerful probabilistic models which

43
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:08,435
have capabilities of anomaly detection
Then threat detection working on the

44
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:14,665
data set in cyber security realm So, in
cyber security, these kind of VAEs are

45
00:03:14,745 --> 00:03:19,415
very powerful and, they are utilized
and in future we might see lot of trends

46
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:21,865
of utilizing such kind of algorithms.

47
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,720
Both of these algorithms are based on
neural network based algorithms and

48
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,820
they have evolved and probably they will
make a system more capable and a lot of

49
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,330
applications will be developed in future.

50
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,409
Now we see over here the rise of
generative models in design and art.

51
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:43,955
So, currently machine learning and
deep learning technologies are being

52
00:03:43,955 --> 00:03:49,275
used in as well as healthcare and
cybersecurity fields, but in future

53
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:54,005
we'll see a rise of these kind of
models being utilized in architecture,

54
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:58,934
art, and all those industries
because they have the capability to

55
00:03:58,994 --> 00:04:03,210
kind of generate like They have the
ability to understand the pattern.

56
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:08,230
So if somebody has certain things in
mind, and if you enable such kind of

57
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:13,069
decision making, then these kinds of
models can generate certain kinds of

58
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:15,310
design, whatever you have in your mind.

59
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,970
And if you are able to convey it to
the model and the model will in turn

60
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,380
generate the design and art for you.

61
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,800
So it will become that kind of
a powerful system in future.

62
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:32,820
Now in, AI, AI is very useful in
cyber security, not because, it can

63
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,050
do all the basic tasks, but because
these generative models, they might be

64
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,570
able to do a lot of threat detection,
vulnerability assessment, fraud

65
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,060
prevention, and such kind of activities.

66
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,840
And this is because the algorithms
and, Algorithms have evolved in such

67
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,550
a high way that these kind of threat
detection, instead of taking sim tools,

68
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:58,469
we can use such kind of algorithms to
detect threats in the organization.

69
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,649
So for example, let me
give you a scenario.

70
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:07,241
If there are a lot of cyber criminals,
which are Using AI based tools

71
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:11,989
like chat GPT and various other
tools to do phishing attacks, DDoS

72
00:05:11,989 --> 00:05:13,335
attacks and such kind of things.

73
00:05:13,665 --> 00:05:18,715
So in threat detection, if we leverage
such kind of models, deep learning models

74
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:23,685
and train them using Python, then this
will become kind of good, kind of, it

75
00:05:23,685 --> 00:05:27,655
will become, it will help us in developing
and mitigating such kind of threats.

76
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:32,415
And it will also enable vulnerability
assessment, fraud prevention, and such

77
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,235
kind of activities, which are not.

78
00:05:34,885 --> 00:05:40,175
Clearly and not that powerful using
the existing tools, although I would

79
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:44,375
say, although these kinds of existing
cyber security tools are good enough,

80
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:49,085
but there is 10 percent chance
where such kind of tools might fail.

81
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:55,635
And in such kind of situation, If
we take help of AI tools like RNN,

82
00:05:55,675 --> 00:05:59,855
Recurrent Neural Network, these
kind of AI algorithms can help us

83
00:05:59,885 --> 00:06:04,164
to detect certain threats, then
predict vulnerabilities, some fraud

84
00:06:04,245 --> 00:06:06,035
prevention, that kind of activities.

85
00:06:06,045 --> 00:06:11,475
So these, these tools, instead of
relying on such kind of cybersecurity

86
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:15,374
tools, we can leverage AI algorithms,
which are trained using deep learning.

87
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:20,245
neural networks using Python and this
can enable us such kind of better

88
00:06:20,555 --> 00:06:22,915
security posture within the organization.

89
00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:27,764
There are multiple, many threat, many
algorithms like neural network, for

90
00:06:27,765 --> 00:06:33,975
example, Microsoft, as well as Amazon
also has certain kinds of threat detection

91
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,715
algorithms, which they are training.

92
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:41,555
And building upon their AI tools
to improve the cyber security and

93
00:06:41,595 --> 00:06:43,605
operations within the organization.

94
00:06:43,615 --> 00:06:48,755
So, in future, we might see vulnerability
assessment and fraud prevention

95
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:54,874
activities done by AI, and it will
have better accuracy score in future.

96
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:58,334
Now we come to graph neural network.

97
00:06:58,344 --> 00:07:05,461
So GNNs are also a powerful tool within
cyber security, which can enable us to

98
00:07:05,461 --> 00:07:10,460
identify anomalies, predict threats,
do complex kind of transformation,

99
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:16,393
relationship mapping, and, maybe it
can, detect certain kinds of anomalies

100
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:22,663
within the data, vulnerability data,
which SIM tools like Splunk, AlienVault,

101
00:07:22,663 --> 00:07:24,423
and such kind of tools cannot detect.

102
00:07:24,463 --> 00:07:29,403
So these algorithms, if they are
trained and if they are able to

103
00:07:29,463 --> 00:07:34,693
provide a good picture about the
anomalies and security posture, these

104
00:07:34,873 --> 00:07:36,493
algorithms can become very useful.

105
00:07:37,013 --> 00:07:40,403
Good helping hand in, uncovering
certain kinds of threats.

106
00:07:40,403 --> 00:07:44,893
And what I am explaining over here
is not just using these kinds of

107
00:07:45,003 --> 00:07:49,563
tools, but also integrating them with
the existing cybersecurity tools.

108
00:07:49,653 --> 00:07:52,263
Organization can have better outcome.

109
00:07:52,403 --> 00:07:57,433
of detecting DDoS attacks or certain
kinds of threat threat actors

110
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:59,703
and identifying cybercriminals.

111
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:04,713
So it's quite beneficial and these
kinds of models should be trained

112
00:08:04,713 --> 00:08:09,393
so that security posture and threat
detection capabilities can be increased.

113
00:08:09,893 --> 00:08:13,613
Now we come to future
of AI in cyber security.

114
00:08:14,303 --> 00:08:18,503
So, There are multiple
aspects where AI can help.

115
00:08:19,153 --> 00:08:21,443
This is right now in threat detection.

116
00:08:21,463 --> 00:08:26,323
Obviously, it can help us to
provide some immediate inroads.

117
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:31,903
And in future, it can also help
us to identify the attackers.

118
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:35,593
If let's say if the attacker
is using AI based tools.

119
00:08:36,103 --> 00:08:41,743
These kind of things can be kind of
detected by AI tools rather than using

120
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:43,923
the existing cyber security tools.

121
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:50,063
And organizations can improve their
security reporting then when there won't

122
00:08:50,073 --> 00:08:56,383
be that many requirement of that many
folks to look into the basic aspects.

123
00:08:56,383 --> 00:09:01,563
So basic security aspects and
reporting can be automated by using AI.

124
00:09:02,413 --> 00:09:08,183
Whereas security engineers and other folks
can look into some other advanced aspects.

125
00:09:08,193 --> 00:09:13,973
So the work can be distributed
and cyber security operations

126
00:09:13,973 --> 00:09:16,343
can be improved in such a way.

127
00:09:17,093 --> 00:09:20,823
And now we come to ethical
considerations in AI.

128
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:26,723
So over here, AI can be a good thing
in cyber security and other operations.

129
00:09:26,753 --> 00:09:32,603
But AI, there are a lot of issues like
Privacy and security issues, then bias

130
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:37,223
and discrimination and all those things
and job displacement kind of issues.

131
00:09:37,663 --> 00:09:42,413
So these are some ethical considerations
of AI, which we need to look

132
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:46,683
into as we try to fine tune and
deploy the models in production.

133
00:09:46,693 --> 00:09:47,533
We use.

134
00:09:47,773 --> 00:09:51,163
We need to look into the
compliance aspects as well.

135
00:09:51,163 --> 00:09:56,123
Compliance and governance related
processes that AI would be able

136
00:09:56,373 --> 00:10:02,023
to have any privacy implications
or security related implications.

137
00:10:02,023 --> 00:10:07,483
So based on what kind of data you are
feeding to the AI algorithm, these

138
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:11,403
kinds of things needs to be discussed
with the compliance and I would say

139
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:17,093
the security and compliance team
and also governance and other teams.

140
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:22,043
All these things need to be discussed
so that the AI algorithms are

141
00:10:22,093 --> 00:10:26,363
capable enough and they don't hamper
any of our ethical considerations.

142
00:10:26,863 --> 00:10:29,963
Now we come to recurrent neural network.

143
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,163
So recurrent neural network, what
is a recurrent neural network?

144
00:10:33,173 --> 00:10:38,983
This kind of a neural network is a very
advanced level neural network, which

145
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:42,373
focuses more on kind of detecting threats.

146
00:10:42,783 --> 00:10:45,213
finding the anomalies in the dataset.

147
00:10:45,643 --> 00:10:49,333
Then, predicting the anomalies
and that kind of thing.

148
00:10:49,723 --> 00:10:54,463
It behaves very different from
convolutional neural network because

149
00:10:54,463 --> 00:10:59,583
convolutional neural network, for
example, is used more into autonomous

150
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:04,413
driving and detecting images and
classifying images and such kind of thing.

151
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:08,373
Whereas is a neural network,
which is based on more of.

152
00:11:08,658 --> 00:11:13,668
Detecting anomalies in a data set and
finding and improving the security

153
00:11:13,668 --> 00:11:15,678
posture within the organization.

154
00:11:16,148 --> 00:11:22,358
So those, those are the use cases of RNN
and RNN is currently very extensively

155
00:11:22,368 --> 00:11:25,058
used in such kind of anomaly detection.

156
00:11:25,128 --> 00:11:31,078
I, I would say before implementing RNN
algorithm, we should look into some basic

157
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:33,888
algorithms like XGBoost is one of them.

158
00:11:34,558 --> 00:11:35,588
Then we have IsolationForest.

159
00:11:35,638 --> 00:11:36,858
XGBoost.

160
00:11:37,013 --> 00:11:41,083
which is also a very good algorithm,
which I have trained to look

161
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,173
into the cyber security data set.

162
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:45,523
We'll go through that
in our next few slides.

163
00:11:45,923 --> 00:11:51,673
So the RNN architecture, this slide
mentions about the architecture of RNN,

164
00:11:51,803 --> 00:11:58,238
and it has input layer, hidden layer,
Then activation function and output layer.

165
00:11:58,598 --> 00:12:03,238
So it's like advanced features as
compared to neural network where he,

166
00:12:03,258 --> 00:12:07,818
it has input layer, then hidden layer,
which are trained in a different way.

167
00:12:07,868 --> 00:12:14,028
Then we have activation function, which is
also kind of, developed in a different way

168
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:16,178
as compared to traditional neural network.

169
00:12:16,748 --> 00:12:23,158
And some of RNN are associated
to language modeling, generating

170
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:25,833
Then, speech recognition.

171
00:12:26,263 --> 00:12:30,313
Then we have, translation of
machines, image recognition,

172
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:31,993
and such kind of things.

173
00:12:32,693 --> 00:12:37,193
There are a lot of use case of RNN
currently in cybersecurity where it

174
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:41,943
can detect threats and then provide
details of the threats, vulnerability

175
00:12:41,943 --> 00:12:44,373
detection, and that kind of thing.

176
00:12:44,593 --> 00:12:48,773
The best, the currently the best
algorithm which can be used for

177
00:12:48,773 --> 00:12:50,463
time series is the transformer base.

178
00:12:51,154 --> 00:12:52,023
Time GPT.

179
00:12:52,493 --> 00:12:57,373
So time GPT is the algorithm, the
model, which is developed by next law.

180
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:04,363
This company uses heavily transformer
based models to predict it provides a time

181
00:13:04,363 --> 00:13:06,833
series analysis, and it is very powerful.

182
00:13:07,343 --> 00:13:12,210
And the use cases are related to
finance, web traffic analysis, internet

183
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:18,000
of things, weather forecasting,
are related to anomaly detection,

184
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,993
finding anomalies in data set.

185
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:24,038
Classifying the anomalies
and such kind of thing.

186
00:13:24,608 --> 00:13:26,758
So time series is also time.

187
00:13:27,128 --> 00:13:31,558
GPT is a very important algorithm and
it's, since it is transformer based,

188
00:13:32,048 --> 00:13:36,938
it has evolved quite drastically as
compared to traditional neural network.

189
00:13:36,938 --> 00:13:42,188
And I would like to, I, I. We will
be able to see a lot of applications

190
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:47,407
of transformer based algorithms in
near future, because right now the

191
00:13:47,407 --> 00:13:52,818
trend is going on where a lot of AI
applications are being developed on

192
00:13:52,818 --> 00:13:57,098
a transformer based kind of models
like chat, GPT, and all those things,

193
00:13:57,158 --> 00:14:00,988
all these kinds of applications are
developed using transformer based

194
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:06,158
models, even these kinds of algorithms,
which are being used in deep seek.

195
00:14:06,229 --> 00:14:09,648
Kind of these kinds of companies
are using transformer based

196
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:13,508
models, which are trained in a very
different way as compared to normal

197
00:14:14,118 --> 00:14:15,728
neural network based algorithms.

198
00:14:15,738 --> 00:14:20,808
So I believe transformer based
models will have a lot of big

199
00:14:20,808 --> 00:14:22,418
impacts in next few years.

200
00:14:22,588 --> 00:14:27,798
Now we've come to this very good use
case of Python with Spark integration.

201
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:31,328
So I have done some work on Spark earlier.

202
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:34,488
So I am providing some
details about how Spark.

203
00:14:34,648 --> 00:14:40,198
Can help backend and machine learning
engineers, because this is a distributed

204
00:14:40,478 --> 00:14:42,898
framework for big data processing.

205
00:14:42,908 --> 00:14:47,418
And it is very easy to use and,
it helps to integrate with REST

206
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:50,248
API and various other, databases.

207
00:14:50,568 --> 00:14:55,088
Spark, currently has a capability
to integrate with these backend

208
00:14:55,108 --> 00:14:59,479
data stores, like Cassandra, then,
MongoDB, then, all the, Elasticsearch

209
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:02,329
and other faster NoSQL databases.

210
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:06,109
Spark also integrates
very quickly with Kafka.

211
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:13,009
So, if your distributed system has
Kafka and all these tools, then you

212
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:16,239
should also consider Spark integration.

213
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:20,878
In Spark integration, what you
need to do is to use PySpark.

214
00:15:21,739 --> 00:15:26,889
Where you try to write an API,
query the API using Spark, PySpark,

215
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:29,669
and then store it into the tables.

216
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:34,159
You can also store it into any kind
of databases, and it is very powerful.

217
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:37,519
It works with distributed systems.

218
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,709
It can, Provide you the transformation.

219
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:44,199
You can do transformation using
Spark and then dump the data

220
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:46,189
into any kind of a data store.

221
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:49,569
And it is very fast and
very scalable enough.

222
00:15:49,729 --> 00:15:54,169
The real world applications of Spark are
related to big data processing, developing

223
00:15:54,169 --> 00:16:00,919
ETL pipelines, performing transformations,
then querying and writing into APIs,

224
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:04,329
fetching, ingesting data from APIs.

225
00:16:04,869 --> 00:16:09,389
And all those things and also machine
learning capabilities in spark is

226
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:14,389
also very good, but it is not very
much good like the existing deep

227
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:18,549
learning capabilities and streaming
spark applications are mainly used

228
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:23,239
for streaming, building streaming
applications and taking the data from

229
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:28,599
Kafka and putting it into any kind
of data store after transformation.

230
00:16:29,444 --> 00:16:33,764
Now, next we will go into
deep dive into the code.

231
00:16:33,904 --> 00:16:40,943
So this slide over here provides
details about the Python PySpark code.

232
00:16:41,024 --> 00:16:45,264
This code is basically to
ingest data from a REST API.

233
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:52,014
And after, We ingest the data in from
REST API, we are writing it and this

234
00:16:52,034 --> 00:16:58,784
code over here, it will try to take the
data from API and put it into a Spark

235
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:05,394
DataFrame and Spark DataFrame is very
powerful because it can handle tons of

236
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:12,664
data as compared to, and we can data store
after ingesting the data from web API.

237
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:14,814
Now we look into this.

238
00:17:14,854 --> 00:17:19,744
This is a vulnerability data set, which
I was talking about, where, deep learning

239
00:17:19,744 --> 00:17:25,164
and machine learning based capabilities
are good enough to detect threats.

240
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:31,264
So this vulnerability, this data is a
vulnerability data with, having multiple.

241
00:17:31,764 --> 00:17:33,884
columns related to vulnerabilities.

242
00:17:33,934 --> 00:17:38,934
Then, we want to identify these
kinds of vulnerabilities not by

243
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:41,314
using tool, but by using AI model.

244
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:47,020
So over here, I have developed
this AI model where I am

245
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,887
cleaning the vulnerability data.

246
00:17:47,887 --> 00:17:52,544
And, we have certain criteria
over here where we are taking

247
00:17:52,554 --> 00:17:54,934
the clean data with complexity.

248
00:17:55,914 --> 00:18:01,684
Over here, we are trying to find out
high complexity and medium severity

249
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:05,464
and CV as a score of greater than six.

250
00:18:06,104 --> 00:18:11,464
And then I have written this, first
of all, I have done perform cleaning

251
00:18:11,464 --> 00:18:17,594
over here, and, After cleaning the data
set, I have performed transformations

252
00:18:18,074 --> 00:18:23,114
and looked into certain features
which we require like CVSS score,

253
00:18:23,594 --> 00:18:29,264
severity encoded, complexity encoded,
and then I have trained the model.

254
00:18:29,424 --> 00:18:31,004
Isolation forest over here.

255
00:18:31,714 --> 00:18:36,884
And, after I perform model
training, I have also, predicted

256
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:38,634
and developed the anomalies.

257
00:18:38,674 --> 00:18:45,464
so this, anomalies of clean data consists
of, high, all those, rows which have,

258
00:18:45,904 --> 00:18:50,724
complexity high, severity of medium
and CVS score of greater than six.

259
00:18:51,314 --> 00:18:57,734
And, finally, I am able to, the model is
able to provide the anomalies and, this

260
00:18:57,734 --> 00:19:02,264
can be obviously automated, by using,
other, highly capable models as well,

261
00:19:02,294 --> 00:19:04,764
but I have tried using isolation forest.

262
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:12,059
And then, I had also tried, this kind
of anomaly detection using XGBoost and,

263
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:17,944
I am, trying to leverage RNN and other,
transformer based model to, predict,

264
00:19:18,014 --> 00:19:19,824
certain anomalies in the dataset.

265
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:21,144
So.

266
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:26,594
in few months I will be using
transformer based models to predict,

267
00:19:26,594 --> 00:19:28,664
certain anomalies within the dataset.

268
00:19:29,164 --> 00:19:33,284
now we come to over here, the
convergence of AI and security.

269
00:19:33,284 --> 00:19:35,884
So, AI and security.

270
00:19:35,984 --> 00:19:42,014
these are, very different kind of, things,
but, AI can be used in cybersecurity,

271
00:19:42,524 --> 00:19:45,224
in, Improving the security function.

272
00:19:45,234 --> 00:19:50,334
So it cannot, generally replace
all the existing security tools and

273
00:19:50,334 --> 00:19:56,804
features, but it can help us to provide
more, better mitigation, detection,

274
00:19:57,024 --> 00:20:00,884
threat detection, fraud detection,
and those kinds of capabilities.

275
00:20:00,884 --> 00:20:03,869
So it is likely to help.

276
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:08,869
The team in, building more, better,
security posture within the organization

277
00:20:09,569 --> 00:20:11,639
and, transforming industries.

278
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:17,509
The impact of AI advancement is,
kind of helping in building more of,

279
00:20:17,589 --> 00:20:22,439
autonomous systems, drug discovery,
and, developing personalized medicine.

280
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:28,534
So these kinds of things are the use
cases which can, be Done in future, but

281
00:20:28,844 --> 00:20:36,734
right now the capabilities of AI are to
improve the cyber security as well as

282
00:20:37,234 --> 00:20:42,534
some of the tech industry improvement of
the processes within the tech industry.

283
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,894
And, what are the key takeaways?

284
00:20:44,904 --> 00:20:49,404
So in this slide, I have mentioned
about the deep learning since it

285
00:20:49,734 --> 00:20:54,544
is, having a lot of, a lot of, AI
models like reinforcement learning,

286
00:20:54,544 --> 00:21:00,924
generative models, and, all these
things, but it is critical to understand

287
00:21:00,924 --> 00:21:03,189
what Use cases, they can help in.

288
00:21:03,189 --> 00:21:05,889
So we have to understand the
use case in a better way.

289
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:09,629
And then, go into specific
models, which can help.

290
00:21:09,629 --> 00:21:16,269
And, the basic things are to write, start
with the simpler models and then automate

291
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:21,309
it and improve upon, and then look into
some advanced modeling capabilities.

292
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:26,779
So in that way we can automate certain
processes, in our, In cybersecurity,

293
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:32,026
in data engineering, as well as,
analytics, and it can also help

294
00:21:32,026 --> 00:21:33,966
in, building analytic pipelines.

295
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:37,346
So that's it from my side.

296
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:41,836
hope you like this session and
let me know if you would like to

297
00:21:42,356 --> 00:21:44,136
have more, additional information.
