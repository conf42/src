00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,610
Hello everyone, myself
Sai Krishna Paladugu.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,250
I'm an iOS developer.

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:10,350
So today my topic is contactless
integration for kiosk and

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,420
iOS devices using JavaScript.

5
00:00:13,229 --> 00:00:18,930
So basically the technologies
I'm going to cover here NFC,

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,210
Bluetooth and QR code technologies.

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:27,020
Basically the implementation for the
kiosk for the various industries.

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,530
Yeah, let me go to my table of contents
and Yeah, here is all the contacts

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm going to cover about today.

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,119
the iOS kiosk integration, WebView
in native iOS development, With

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,150
javascript nfc technology for seamless
transactions bluetooth for proximity

12
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:48,720
based services qr code and barcode
scanning for contactless integration

13
00:00:49,459 --> 00:00:56,970
payment integration with apple pay custom
ios apps for kiosk and use cases of ios

14
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,950
kiosks in various industries mdm tools
for easy device management So let me go

15
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:09,229
to the first topic So the first topic
is introducing, the kiosk integration.

16
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:14,849
So basically, the kiosks where
outside industries use iPhones

17
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:21,480
and iPads, basically in the kiosk
wise, they need a big screen.

18
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,269
The people can come and
they can do their, tasks.

19
00:01:25,529 --> 00:01:29,829
from themselves, most preferably
iPads would be the best option.

20
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:34,439
So basically these iPads and iPhones
are increasingly being used in the self

21
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,349
service kiosks due to their intuitive
interfaces and powerful hardware.

22
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,969
so these are all, very efficient and also
we don't see any much lag and it is all.

23
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:47,239
prompt and it will be more effective.

24
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:51,779
these contactless experience are becoming
essential for reducing the spread of

25
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:54,469
germs and enhancing user convenience.

26
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:59,520
Basically, the people are experienced
a lot in the pre pandemic situation

27
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,340
where this interaction, to the people
to people will be, more concerns.

28
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,220
So where we come up with the solution
called a contactless integration for

29
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:17,940
kiosk where people can come to our store
for a shipping and they can do their

30
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,074
self scanning the packages and printing
the receipts and things like that.

31
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:25,765
All the stops they can do for
themselves without waiting for the

32
00:02:25,775 --> 00:02:27,835
team member to assist what they want.

33
00:02:28,435 --> 00:02:33,195
So Basically, this is all these
devices are very fast and secure and

34
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:38,224
touch free interactions Industry like
retail healthcare and hospitality.

35
00:02:38,724 --> 00:02:41,084
So let me go to the another slide.

36
00:02:41,584 --> 00:02:48,524
So WebView in a native iOS development,
Swift and Objective C with JavaScript.

37
00:02:48,944 --> 00:02:53,064
So basically in our current
application where we integrated,

38
00:02:53,184 --> 00:02:59,304
JavaScript for one of the function,
which is, to load, the web page.

39
00:02:59,714 --> 00:03:05,464
these are all the steps, We followed
and we implemented a webpage

40
00:03:05,464 --> 00:03:07,504
inside of a native iwas container.

41
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:11,754
So in the current project, we
just creating a project and just

42
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:15,984
adding a WK web view to your
current com, view controller.

43
00:03:15,984 --> 00:03:19,554
If it is a start view controller,
when you are starting a view, the

44
00:03:19,554 --> 00:03:24,084
first you there, you can integrate
the W controller where you want to

45
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:26,004
navigate to the specific webpage.

46
00:03:26,454 --> 00:03:28,884
So there we can import a web.

47
00:03:29,394 --> 00:03:34,034
Kit and create a outlet for web
view and write a code to load

48
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:38,644
page using url request So run
the app to test the web view.

49
00:03:38,664 --> 00:03:45,369
So optionally Enable the javascript handle
navigate events load HTML pages content.

50
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:47,869
This simple process allows
display web content within

51
00:03:47,869 --> 00:03:51,099
the iOS app using WKWebView.

52
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:56,729
Basically, this web view is more helpful
when your primary application, is a web

53
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:00,899
application where you want to use the
same features into your application.

54
00:04:01,694 --> 00:04:03,954
Native iOS, on the iPad.

55
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:09,484
So this will be more useful where you
can, inherit all the features using

56
00:04:09,484 --> 00:04:14,734
this WKWebView and you can just load
the URL and just access the features.

57
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:19,429
this is, the functionality where,
web developer can develop and, iOS

58
00:04:19,429 --> 00:04:21,899
developer can use, using a WebKit.

59
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:26,149
let's see how the code
and how we have to create.

60
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,129
basically, this is a iOS one of
the view controller where you

61
00:04:30,179 --> 00:04:32,279
have to import UIKit and WebKit.

62
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,989
In the particular view controller, you
just have to extend a view UI, view

63
00:04:36,989 --> 00:04:41,889
controller, and a script message handler,
the WK script message handler and

64
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:43,599
where you have to initiate a variable.

65
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:49,859
And, in the, when view is loading, in
the first time, it'll call the web view

66
00:04:49,859 --> 00:04:55,289
configuration that you have to load where,
use user content controller and add.

67
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,939
So here the self is.

68
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:01,849
self is the thing where, you have to,
call the current, view controller.

69
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,599
where you have to mention
the name of the application.

70
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:09,420
and where you have, Later on, you just
have to initialize your web view, how you

71
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,640
have to add and the configuration as well.

72
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:18,139
So if for example, I take
a url of our conference42.

73
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,220
com slash javascript2024.

74
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,385
I just want to load this url inside the
native app That we can do it using this

75
00:05:26,695 --> 00:05:31,885
request and URL request, where you have
to load all the features and requests.

76
00:05:32,155 --> 00:05:37,205
So these function, basically,
user content, controller, where

77
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:41,065
you have to, in, where you
have to create and just, pass.

78
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:47,790
the WK user content controller and in the
did this you just have to Message the WK

79
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:53,790
script message and here if the if you want
to receive a message and you just have to,

80
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,669
call the message equal to your application
name and just where you can print the,

81
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,479
whatever the message you want to print.

82
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,500
So basically this is an interaction
where JavaScript, that we can,

83
00:06:04,609 --> 00:06:09,099
use for loading the webpages
inside of a native iOS container.

84
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:15,724
So the next slide is about NFC technology
for seamless transaction, basically

85
00:06:15,754 --> 00:06:20,614
for the kiosk in our, shipping stores
where customer wants to, pay with

86
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,424
their Apple Pay, they can do it.

87
00:06:22,434 --> 00:06:26,314
So basically we designed this
using the predefined libraries that

88
00:06:26,314 --> 00:06:31,374
is provided by Apple and, where
you have to integrate the NFC.

89
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:36,579
frameworks and, just have to send
the token, the sensitive token

90
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:40,589
to when some customer wants to
pay at the end of the shipment.

91
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:42,650
this integration helps a lot.

92
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,760
this is again, does not require any,
team member help in, inside the store.

93
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:52,045
So this allows users to make secure
transactions and authenticate

94
00:06:52,085 --> 00:06:55,565
their identity by simply tapping
the driver's device on a kiosk.

95
00:06:56,015 --> 00:07:00,335
Apple Pay facilitates contactless
payments, making process fast and secure.

96
00:07:00,885 --> 00:07:05,915
So useful in various sectors like in
retail and transportation healthcare.

97
00:07:06,415 --> 00:07:10,555
These are all the industries where
this NFC technology is used a lot.

98
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:16,154
Even, I think this uses everybody
knows in, in current, outside

99
00:07:16,154 --> 00:07:17,675
space, so everybody knows.

100
00:07:17,685 --> 00:07:19,665
So how this is more useful.

101
00:07:20,165 --> 00:07:24,285
So next topic is, Bluetooth
for proximity based services.

102
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:29,135
So basically in our kiosk application,
basically, we use, Bluetooth

103
00:07:29,135 --> 00:07:33,725
services, BLE functionality, and,
where we have to discover our

104
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:36,395
printers and to, print the receipts.

105
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:44,585
So we use a Bluetooth technology and we
use an accessory in the iOS where you

106
00:07:44,585 --> 00:07:50,045
have to fetch the particular device,
the Zebra, if it is something like a

107
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,900
Example of a zebra device that we have
we will just fetch that particular

108
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:01,670
printer and we will connect and These
printers would help to print the receipts.

109
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:06,100
So basically these proximity
based services like Inside

110
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,510
the store it will be used.

111
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:13,650
So basically These actions these are
for triggering the print printing the

112
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:19,635
customer receipts and shipping labels
so So these, these are all ideal for a

113
00:08:19,655 --> 00:08:25,265
service kiosk and even it is useful for,
useful for hotel check ins, healthcare

114
00:08:25,295 --> 00:08:29,805
systems, where the interactions can
initially, initiated automatically.

115
00:08:29,955 --> 00:08:35,005
So this is like a, process
of integrating for a kiosk.

116
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:41,475
for customer usage is a lot, when team
member assistance is not required and

117
00:08:41,475 --> 00:08:47,245
customer usage is a lot where we have to
use a proximity services, is required.

118
00:08:47,775 --> 00:08:52,665
next thing is, QR code and barcode
scanning for, Contactless interactions.

119
00:08:53,045 --> 00:08:58,625
So basically scanning a QR code
nowadays, like it is very popular.

120
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:02,985
it's a, every iOS device has a,
it's a built in camera where, it

121
00:09:02,985 --> 00:09:07,495
is a capability to scan QR codes
and barcodes for contactless ways

122
00:09:07,515 --> 00:09:09,285
for user to interact with kiosk.

123
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,875
So easy to, and also if.

124
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:17,540
If it is a more faster system where we
can integrate third party scanners, the

125
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:23,840
third party scanners gives more, more
faster and it will be more accurate scans

126
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,360
where we can do that using the libraries
provided by the third party suppliers.

127
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,240
That is also doable for
kiosk implementation.

128
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:37,020
and, the currently the kiosks are
like using a lot in the airports for

129
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,300
ticket scanning and product information
retrieval and contactless check ins.

130
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,550
as I mentioned, it is, Used in the
different sectors retail healthcare

131
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:52,300
and transportation sector So when
coming to the qr code creation and

132
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:57,330
barcode creation the barcode creation
will be happen on there Based on the

133
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:02,670
business logic under the likewise
The same thing is for QR code.

134
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,330
So basically the creating the strings
when somebody scan the QR code, there

135
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:11,430
will be a string that will be sent to the
backend and backend gives the response.

136
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,000
That response we will be going to print
or we will going to show to the customer.

137
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:21,290
so this is something more, useful
for the contactless integration.

138
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:27,260
so these barcode and QR codes usage
is a lot even in especially in the

139
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:33,240
movie tickets or in the various
places for a passes and also.

140
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,320
So next topic is payment
integration with Apple Pay.

141
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:44,670
So this is very booming thing in United
States or everywhere and overall the

142
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,120
Overall all the countries so apple pay is
consumed a lot like, you know for secure

143
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:55,240
contactless transactions using face id
and touch id This is also integrated

144
00:10:55,330 --> 00:11:02,360
and In our Self serve kiosk, so this
is Reducing risk of both business and

145
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,320
customers like this is a good solution.

146
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:10,140
for Consumers retailers business
holders and customers are everybody

147
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,720
in the industry so Common use cases.

148
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,810
This is also helped a lot this
technology in the restaurants and public

149
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:22,945
transportation ticket purchases so in
our applications, when we You Involved

150
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:27,635
in coming to the coding part in our iOS
native library where we have to Use the

151
00:11:27,665 --> 00:11:32,055
predefined libraries provided by apple
and we just have to integrate passing

152
00:11:32,055 --> 00:11:34,195
our sensitive access tokens and all

153
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:40,775
the next thing custom ios apps
for kiosk so Basically based

154
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:42,795
on the business requirement.

155
00:11:42,795 --> 00:11:49,127
So every industry has their own
own way of serving people so

156
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:51,217
It is based on the requirement.

157
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:58,587
We just have to Do a custom solution using
ios and based on The devices that we're

158
00:11:58,597 --> 00:12:06,707
going to control in the enterprise level
so the We can develop the ios apps to

159
00:12:06,707 --> 00:12:10,837
create a specific kiosk experience that
integrate with back end systems like crm

160
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:17,227
erp and customer loyalty programs if we
If somebody goes to the example to the

161
00:12:17,457 --> 00:12:22,687
casino or they have a membership they can
just you know Swipe the card and just can

162
00:12:22,757 --> 00:12:24,927
check their points and all same thing.

163
00:12:24,927 --> 00:12:29,227
This loyalty is applied Lte
programs are applied everywhere.

164
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:36,292
So basically these kiosks are helpful and
we just have to create them library and

165
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:41,242
just, we just have to manage what, based
on the business requirement, how the, how

166
00:12:41,272 --> 00:12:43,062
their business want to serve the people.

167
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:48,692
So these features like, tap to pay,
push notification, digital receipt,

168
00:12:48,692 --> 00:12:50,572
enhancing self service experience.

169
00:12:50,612 --> 00:12:53,682
This is all the, so many advantages.

170
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:58,947
using the iOS space so custom apps
can offer multi ingredient support.

171
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:03,197
personalized interactions, user friendly
interfaces for better engagement.

172
00:13:03,697 --> 00:13:03,957
Yeah.

173
00:13:04,047 --> 00:13:05,337
Next slide.

174
00:13:05,837 --> 00:13:10,157
Use cases of kiosk for
various, industries.

175
00:13:10,737 --> 00:13:15,047
Basically, these kiosks in a retail
sector, the customers can browse,

176
00:13:15,057 --> 00:13:18,957
scan and purchase products, without
physical contact and stream,

177
00:13:19,087 --> 00:13:21,437
streamlining the shopping experience.

178
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:26,387
basically, this, in retail
industry, the customers are more.

179
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:32,692
And, the service, of service of
customers, like giving a best if

180
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:34,192
they are waiting on the lines.

181
00:13:34,202 --> 00:13:37,152
So it will be a, big
headache for the store.

182
00:13:37,252 --> 00:13:38,622
so it, it depends.

183
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:39,992
It is a huge traffic.

184
00:13:39,992 --> 00:13:42,082
It will be a, more wait time.

185
00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:43,802
Customer satisfaction is very less.

186
00:13:43,832 --> 00:13:48,542
If it is a self service kiosk,
so they can come and shop around

187
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:50,272
and just scan their stuff and go.

188
00:13:50,732 --> 00:13:55,622
As, easy so in the retail
industry, the, the satisfaction

189
00:13:55,622 --> 00:13:56,922
of the customer will be more.

190
00:13:56,922 --> 00:14:01,872
So now everybody like in the outside,
all the stores, retail stores, so

191
00:14:01,902 --> 00:14:07,002
reducing the human, power and just
increasing the kiosk where, serving

192
00:14:07,002 --> 00:14:09,132
the people is very better way.

193
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:14,212
in the healthcare, these kiosks
are, helpful for patient check in.

194
00:14:14,212 --> 00:14:18,002
If they can go and just enter
their confirmation, they can check

195
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:22,282
in themselves, and the technician
would know the patient is here.

196
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:27,402
And, without asking and just,
checking with the, whatever the store,

197
00:14:27,582 --> 00:14:30,362
representative or the, lab technician.

198
00:14:30,972 --> 00:14:35,072
In the transportation industry where,
in the, in airports and transit systems

199
00:14:35,072 --> 00:14:36,922
use kiosks for contact solicitating.

200
00:14:37,412 --> 00:14:41,502
So boarding pass retrieval
and, Journey planning.

201
00:14:41,592 --> 00:14:43,072
So basically that would help.

202
00:14:43,642 --> 00:14:50,442
So in the hospitality hotels use kiosk
for guest check ins, room selection,

203
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:54,652
contactless payments and improving
efficiency and guest satisfaction.

204
00:14:55,152 --> 00:14:59,242
So MDM tools for easy device management.

205
00:14:59,242 --> 00:15:07,542
Basically in our space we use MDM to
manage our enterprise mobile applications

206
00:15:08,162 --> 00:15:11,702
to Install on our enterprise devices.

207
00:15:11,882 --> 00:15:16,892
So these MDMs, tools are allow
business manage and update I was

208
00:15:17,452 --> 00:15:19,422
remotely ensuring smooth operations.

209
00:15:19,922 --> 00:15:26,362
because we will, Manage by pushing
from our MDM console without

210
00:15:26,382 --> 00:15:31,002
asking the team member or the store
representative to install app or

211
00:15:31,032 --> 00:15:38,212
update the app and Take care the iOS
updates and also we just use MDM too.

212
00:15:38,482 --> 00:15:42,492
This is very helpful and even in
the low staffed areas This would

213
00:15:42,502 --> 00:15:47,442
be useful and small Fixes that
we can perform over the MDM tool.

214
00:15:47,602 --> 00:15:51,945
So basically if something stuck, we
can just remove, reboot, over the MDM

215
00:15:51,975 --> 00:15:56,455
tool, that would be helpful managing
remotely instead of, somebody going

216
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,995
there and checking what happens.

217
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:02,390
So these tools are, we always
track the devices when it is on

218
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,880
online and it will go to offline.

219
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:09,360
So MDM tools can push software
updates, monitor performance

220
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,480
and security compliance across
large networks of kiosks.

221
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:18,230
So ideal for kiosks with multiple kiosks
in different locations, ensuring seamless

222
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,520
and secure service across all points.

223
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:28,600
The main more advantages using MDM
is, in my experience, So if something

224
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:33,100
happens, if the device is not
responding, or if we know this particular

225
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,620
location ID, we can just track the
particular serial number of the device.

226
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,870
And we can see if the device
is interacting correctly or

227
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,380
not, we can check the logs.

228
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:48,335
And, that way without asking the customer,
we can just help, over creating if

229
00:16:48,335 --> 00:16:53,095
somebody create the ticket and just, we
can just, fix as, as soon as possible.

230
00:16:53,165 --> 00:16:55,505
This will be a very convenient solution.

231
00:16:55,745 --> 00:17:00,575
So there is so many tools outside
where, MDM solutions, available

232
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,965
for enterprise, mobile devices.

233
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:05,745
So especially for iOS, is.

234
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,000
helps a lot.

235
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,510
these are all that.

236
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:09,440
Yeah.

237
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,900
this is all about I'm going to share.

238
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:12,910
today.

239
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:21,380
basically, I just want to let everybody
know that, using iOS devices and creating

240
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:27,320
business solutions For contactless
integration would be a, going to be

241
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,370
a greater deal in the near future.

242
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,370
and also we can gain more
customer satisfaction and also

243
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,300
it will be helpful for everybody.

244
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,480
In the, pre pandemic situation
and a pandemic situation.

245
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,780
So where these, interaction is
not required, with the people.

246
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:49,400
So thank you, for giving this
opportunity and thanks for joining

247
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,750
everyone conference 42 JavaScript, 2024.

248
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:53,570
Thank you.
