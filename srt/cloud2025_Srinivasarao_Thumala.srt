00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,900
Hi everyone, this is Srinivas Rautumala,
I'm a senior customer engineer helping

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,270
customers in the cloud journey.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,669
I'm here to talk about Azure landing zone
and how it benefits the organizations.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,509
Azure landing zone is a key element for
a successful cloud adoption journey, as

5
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:19,179
it establishes the platform competence
and helps organizations successfully

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,930
migrate and innovate in the cloud,
whether the organizations are building

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,710
a cloud native applications or building
applications for Azure virtual machines.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,300
Azure landing zone lets organization
build a strong foundation.

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,080
Without any delay, let's
jump into the topic.

10
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,930
Before we dive deeper into the Azure
landing zone itself, we need to

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,299
understand where does the landing
zone stand in the cloud journey.

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,540
Cloud Adoption Framework is a
Microsoft best practice guidance

13
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,309
for organizations looking to
migrate, modernize, and optimize

14
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:50,230
their cloud environments on Azure.

15
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,770
The CAF has been divided
into several phases, such as

16
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,900
define strategy, plan, ready.

17
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,570
adopt, govern, manage, and secure.

18
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,760
The first is defined strategy.

19
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,790
It's about defining the business
objectives and justification

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,700
for moving to Azure.

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,770
it's about aligning cloud
investments with business goals.

22
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,066
In the plan phase, organizations
will be assessing the current IT

23
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:16,888
landscape and workload dependencies.

24
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:21,685
In the ready Organizations are
preparing the Azure learning

25
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:25,395
zone, establishing a subscription
model, and configuring policies.

26
00:01:26,235 --> 00:01:29,535
This is, the phase in cloud
adoption framework where we

27
00:01:29,535 --> 00:01:31,045
are going to dive deeper today.

28
00:01:31,545 --> 00:01:35,485
Migrate phase is about, executing
migration plans using tools like

29
00:01:35,485 --> 00:01:39,285
Azure Migrate, Azure Site Recovery,
and Database Migration Service.

30
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:42,955
Governance is about establishing
a governance framework using

31
00:01:43,055 --> 00:01:44,655
Azure Policy and Azure Blueprints.

32
00:01:45,155 --> 00:01:50,275
And in managed organizations needs to
implement tools like Azure Monitor, Azure

33
00:01:50,665 --> 00:01:55,515
Log Analytics, Workspace, Application
Insights for proactive monitoring.

34
00:01:56,105 --> 00:01:57,885
Last but not the least is secure.

35
00:01:57,965 --> 00:02:01,135
Security is a very important
in the cloud journey.

36
00:02:01,574 --> 00:02:04,905
It's about identifying security and
compliance requirements, deploying

37
00:02:05,405 --> 00:02:08,615
cloud posture management tools like
different cloud and same tools like

38
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,415
Sentinel to keep the environment secure.

39
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:11,935
Why do we need a learning zone?

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,100
It's important to have a strong
foundation when we are building the

41
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:21,330
infrastructure, for example, like
building a house or a bridge or a stadium.

42
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,440
The same logic applies to
building the cloud infrastructure.

43
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,010
The strong foundation will enable
organizations to build a secure, scalable,

44
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,120
and a well governed cloud environment
that accelerates deployment while

45
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:40,365
ensuring compliance, security, and best
practices for The enterprise workloads.

46
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:42,515
What is Azure Learning Zone?

47
00:02:42,735 --> 00:02:46,555
Azure Learning Zone is a conceptual
architecture, which the organization

48
00:02:46,555 --> 00:02:48,275
used to build their Learning Zone.

49
00:02:49,145 --> 00:02:52,125
This will make the organization
more agile, and the Learning Zone

50
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:55,155
architecture will help them grow
their footprint in Azure with ease.

51
00:02:55,655 --> 00:02:58,915
Learning Zone will also
enable them embrace automation

52
00:02:58,955 --> 00:03:00,125
and integration with ease.

53
00:03:00,525 --> 00:03:03,915
Key benefits of the Learning Zone is
agility, scalability, and it's secure.

54
00:03:04,415 --> 00:03:08,465
So this is a very, common topic
and a very important, discussion

55
00:03:08,465 --> 00:03:11,955
we have with the customers, whether
they need a single subscription

56
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:13,975
versus a multiple subscription.

57
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:19,055
Organizations often, go with multiple
subscription to avoid a per subscription

58
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:23,645
resource limit and to better manage
and govern their Azure resources.

59
00:03:24,075 --> 00:03:27,365
It's important to define a
strategy for, scaling your,

60
00:03:27,585 --> 00:03:29,205
applications, in the subscriptions.

61
00:03:29,705 --> 00:03:32,875
Subscriptions have defined
limit for some resource types.

62
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:36,775
For example, the number of virtual
networks in a subscription is limited.

63
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:40,475
When a subscription approaches
these limits, organizations have

64
00:03:40,475 --> 00:03:43,145
to create another subscription and
put additional resources there.

65
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:47,395
Azure Management Groups are top
level containers in Azure hierarchy

66
00:03:47,445 --> 00:03:52,905
that helps organizations manage
access and policies and compliance

67
00:03:52,905 --> 00:03:54,235
across multiple subscriptions.

68
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:58,955
We can segregate the workloads using the
management group like what you're seeing

69
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:00,485
in the picture that's on the right.

70
00:04:01,045 --> 00:04:05,555
Based on environments such as, prod,
pre prod, development, QA, etc.

71
00:04:06,325 --> 00:04:10,505
We can apply these policies based on
different environments at the management

72
00:04:10,535 --> 00:04:14,015
group level, so we don't have to
manage the subscription individually.

73
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:17,725
Also, applying the RBAC policies
is much easier when we have

74
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:18,935
such a management model.

75
00:04:19,285 --> 00:04:22,215
so we can control who has
access to which resources.

76
00:04:22,715 --> 00:04:26,075
Let's look at the key challenges
when working with our customers and

77
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:31,315
partners, where we have received the
feedback on some challenges they face.

78
00:04:32,045 --> 00:04:35,305
When starting with Azure,
customers are being accustomed

79
00:04:35,315 --> 00:04:36,995
to a traditional IT architecture.

80
00:04:37,035 --> 00:04:41,305
The cloud model can get lost in the
translation between the technology

81
00:04:41,305 --> 00:04:43,215
concepts and security models.

82
00:04:43,715 --> 00:04:46,645
On the top of the architectural
challenges, there are challenges

83
00:04:46,655 --> 00:04:47,795
with operating models.

84
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,590
Traditional delivery and management
of IT services is not compatible

85
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,040
with the cloud operating models.

86
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,050
Lastly, our customers and partners
have desired for control of their

87
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:02,560
cloud environment and compliant
platform that generates trust.

88
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,170
What you are seeing here is the Azure
landing zone conceptual architecture,

89
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:12,070
which shows what are the things the
organization might have to be deploying

90
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,860
in the landing zone architecture.

91
00:05:15,705 --> 00:05:19,045
Not all, not all organizations
might need this big of a design.

92
00:05:19,525 --> 00:05:22,615
Depending on the size of the
organization, we can simplify this a bit.

93
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:28,925
On the top, it starts with, the identity,
which is also, called a secure tenant.

94
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:32,925
The organization then, will be
creating different management groups,

95
00:05:33,445 --> 00:05:36,945
underneath the tenants, and, they
are the logical containers for

96
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:38,145
separating different, workloads.

97
00:05:38,645 --> 00:05:40,785
First, we start with the root group.

98
00:05:41,285 --> 00:05:42,335
What you're seeing here.

99
00:05:42,795 --> 00:05:45,865
And, then we create, management
groups underneath it.

100
00:05:46,135 --> 00:05:51,595
Such as the platform, learning
zone, and the sandbox containers.

101
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:55,285
Under the platform, we have identity,
management, and connectivity.

102
00:05:56,235 --> 00:05:59,455
Under the learning zone, different
departments will be creating

103
00:05:59,505 --> 00:06:02,625
their own workloads, for deploying
their resources in Azure.

104
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,580
Each container, under the platform
such as, Identity has its resources

105
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,960
related to Identity, gets deployed
under the Identity subscription.

106
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,880
Let's say an organization is having
Active Directory servers, they'll

107
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,740
be, deploying that Active Directory
servers under the Identity subscription,

108
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,349
which you're seeing on the left.

109
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,610
Under the Management subscription,
resources are, resources

110
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,300
such as, Log Analytics, Azure
Policies are, gets deployed.

111
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,810
And in the connectivity
subscription as well.

112
00:06:31,915 --> 00:06:35,665
you are deploying the network
resources such as, VPN Express Route

113
00:06:36,235 --> 00:06:39,995
and this, connectivity, subscription
will become the hub for your network.

114
00:06:40,495 --> 00:06:43,800
Organization might also follow
different approaches, to get, to

115
00:06:43,845 --> 00:06:47,175
get to the end State organization
might, be of different sizes.

116
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:50,225
Organization might be building
just a platform subscription.

117
00:06:50,725 --> 00:06:55,155
And under the platform subscription, they
will, they might be deploying all the

118
00:06:55,185 --> 00:06:59,865
identity management and network resources
underneath it because they are very small.

119
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:04,405
They might also build a couple of
learning zones for their workloads.

120
00:07:05,205 --> 00:07:08,835
And some of the customers might have
hundreds of subscriptions, for different

121
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:12,445
departments, which who might follow
this, the conceptual model lasses.

122
00:07:12,945 --> 00:07:17,015
So these are the different stages that the
customer might be in the cloud journey.

123
00:07:17,365 --> 00:07:19,845
First is the start stage.

124
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,355
The customers are brand new.

125
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:26,335
They are, they want to move towards an
accelerator architecture with landing

126
00:07:26,335 --> 00:07:31,345
zone accelerator, which I'm going to dive
deeper into this in the latest slide.

127
00:07:31,845 --> 00:07:33,465
Organization might be in the align stage.

128
00:07:33,545 --> 00:07:35,575
Organization have built their design.

129
00:07:36,025 --> 00:07:38,895
but they would like to align
with the best practices.

130
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:41,765
The organization can review
the design areas and assess

131
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:43,135
what parts need to be improved.

132
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:46,915
In the enhanced stage, customers
might, like to enhance their enterprise

133
00:07:46,915 --> 00:07:49,965
case landing zone with some tweaking.

134
00:07:49,985 --> 00:07:53,205
Let's say they would like
to build a better governance

135
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:55,145
or even make it more secure.

136
00:07:55,915 --> 00:07:59,685
Let's start on the cloud journey by
looking at our Greenfield deployment.

137
00:08:00,185 --> 00:08:03,245
The term Greenfield means the
organization don't have anything running

138
00:08:03,245 --> 00:08:06,495
in Azure, and they are planning to
migrate their workloads into Azure.

139
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,595
Are they going to build
their workloads from scratch?

140
00:08:10,045 --> 00:08:14,465
Some organization might have, might
be doing some testing, in Azure,

141
00:08:14,505 --> 00:08:17,405
but they don't have a production,
any workloads running in Azure yet.

142
00:08:18,195 --> 00:08:21,225
If the organizations are in this
phase, it is much easier for them to

143
00:08:21,245 --> 00:08:22,915
build a landing zone from scratch.

144
00:08:23,445 --> 00:08:25,025
How are they going to
build a landing zone?

145
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,915
We have, we offer several options.

146
00:08:27,405 --> 00:08:28,825
which we are going to
see in the next slide.

147
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:33,665
Azure Learning Zone Accelerator are,
so Azure Learning Zone Accelerator

148
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:36,445
are a ready made deployment
experience for organizations where

149
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:41,565
conceptual architecture, fits in
with the operating model and resource

150
00:08:41,575 --> 00:08:42,925
structure they are planning to use.

151
00:08:43,845 --> 00:08:48,035
Organizations can choose, the design
which which they want to deploy using

152
00:08:48,045 --> 00:08:51,595
the Azure portal based deployment
to provide full implementation

153
00:08:51,595 --> 00:08:54,955
of the conceptual architecture
using that portal based interface.

154
00:08:55,455 --> 00:08:59,185
let's look at in detail how to
deploy, the landing zone accelerator.

155
00:08:59,685 --> 00:09:02,675
Organization can use the portal based,
accelerator which you are seeing at

156
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,175
the top to deploy the landing zone.

157
00:09:04,715 --> 00:09:08,195
Organization can also use ARM
template, Bicep, Terraform to

158
00:09:08,195 --> 00:09:09,405
build a landing zone design.

159
00:09:09,905 --> 00:09:13,475
On top of this, partners can build
organizations, sorry, partners can

160
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:17,575
help organizations, in building the
learning zone through automation.

161
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:21,755
The term brownfield, means they're already
running their workloads, organizations

162
00:09:21,755 --> 00:09:25,705
are running their workloads in the cloud,
but they would like to make changes,

163
00:09:25,795 --> 00:09:28,865
since they have, their requirements
have changed over the period of time.

164
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,060
Let's say they built their learning
zone with only 10 applications in mind.

165
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,780
Now they are expanding their portfolio
to 100 and like to make changes so that

166
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,930
they can run those 100 workloads without
any challenge, without any challenges.

167
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,530
Let's look at what are the
common approaches in learning

168
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,829
zone implementation look like.

169
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:53,685
Organizations seek to align with the
target state, target state architecture

170
00:09:53,695 --> 00:09:57,365
by looking at our client structural
alliance architecture, which we

171
00:09:57,395 --> 00:10:01,945
discussed earlier and come up with
tweaks to align with our best practices.

172
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:06,595
Some of the areas they can focus on is
implementing Azure policies for better

173
00:10:06,595 --> 00:10:10,475
governance, building management groups,
hierarchy, implementing ad backed

174
00:10:10,495 --> 00:10:15,425
policies, enhanced network architecture,
and centralizing the security model.

175
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:19,765
Alignment might involve such as
moving resources between subscriptions

176
00:10:19,765 --> 00:10:22,905
or building more subscription to
implement the required best practices.

177
00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:27,575
In the enhanced stage, organizations
have already built an enterprise

178
00:10:28,225 --> 00:10:33,545
scale landing zones and are liking to
make few changes to the landing zone

179
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:35,385
architecture to make it even better.

180
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,925
The areas they can focus on is
governance, management, and security.

181
00:10:40,165 --> 00:10:42,095
They would like to define a business risk.

182
00:10:42,595 --> 00:10:47,335
and convert those risks into policies,
monitor violations, and remediate them.

183
00:10:47,835 --> 00:10:52,215
The organization can use the security
tools, such as, to reduce the security

184
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:56,405
risk and ensure they are prepared for any
security incidents if they were to occur.

185
00:10:56,905 --> 00:10:59,455
I would like to summarize what
we, what we discussed today.

186
00:10:59,815 --> 00:11:03,655
First, I talked about, the
cloud adoption framework and its

187
00:11:03,655 --> 00:11:05,145
importance in the cloud journey.

188
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,840
Where does the landing zone
fit under the CAF framework?

189
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,880
We also looked at the Azure landing
zone conceptual architecture

190
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,180
and how does the design of each
components, such as the management

191
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,160
groups, and various subscriptions.

192
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,950
We looked at the landing zone deployments
options such as, portal, deployment to

193
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:28,120
portal, ARM, Bicep, Terraform options
to build landing zone architecture.

194
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,380
I also discussed about various stages the
organization might be in, in the cloud

195
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,910
journey based on how they have to build
or tweak their learning zone architecture.

196
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,160
Thank you very much.

197
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:44,219
I hope you got a good idea about the
learning zone and its importance.

198
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:44,670
Thank you.
