00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,390
Compared to 76% accuracy
rate of traditional manual

34
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,150
reviews, that is human reviews.

35
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,190
This improvement has led to a

That is you have refine approver
and the ref refiner agents.

56
00:04:22,955 --> 00:04:27,005
Initially, the initial contents
optimized with the 55% reduction

57
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:32,015
in review cycle and 91% accuracy
in identifying compliance issues.
