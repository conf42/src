00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,420
Hello and welcome to com 42 Site
Reliability Engineering 2025.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,140
My name is Ricardo Karo and
today we're going to see what

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,230
can we, what we can learn from
Formula One incident Management.

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:13,870
What are we going to cover today?

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,090
I'll start by setting the stage.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,590
We'll see a natural F1 incident, and
we're going to see how a team, namely

7
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,800
Red Bull went, the series of steps
that they took and the learnings

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,750
that we can take from that incident.

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,135
To overcome and actually have
a car that could run and score

10
00:00:29,135 --> 00:00:32,465
points at the end, we'll see how,
why all of this is important.

11
00:00:32,975 --> 00:00:34,565
So let's start by setting the stage.

12
00:00:35,065 --> 00:00:36,505
So the year is 2020.

13
00:00:36,715 --> 00:00:41,185
So after a series of years of Mercedes
just winning both the drivers and,

14
00:00:41,285 --> 00:00:42,605
and the constructions championship.

15
00:00:42,935 --> 00:00:46,265
2020 year was probably the first
year when there was a feeling that

16
00:00:46,265 --> 00:00:50,525
some other team could challenge the
title, where this is the third race.

17
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:54,505
So Red Bull is one of the contenders
for both the drivers and and

18
00:00:54,505 --> 00:00:55,675
constructions championship.

19
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:59,125
And Maxwell Staffer is their star driver.

20
00:00:59,695 --> 00:01:04,725
During the qualifying, max didn't do a
very good job, so he qualified seventh and

21
00:01:04,785 --> 00:01:06,615
during the Formation lab this happened.

22
00:01:07,115 --> 00:01:08,015
So what happened here?

23
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:11,675
So the formation lab is when the
drivers try to warm up the tires

24
00:01:11,675 --> 00:01:14,705
and get them to the most optimal
temperatures that they want.

25
00:01:15,035 --> 00:01:19,375
As you guys can see, the track is
is wet because it had been raining,

26
00:01:19,435 --> 00:01:20,965
and what happened was that max.

27
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,460
In a, in an effort to warm up the
tires as much as he possibly could.

28
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,645
He tra he brake too late and he had a
lockup by locking up and a track being wet

29
00:01:29,705 --> 00:01:33,565
max just sl just went through the barriers
and he actually crashed into the wall.

30
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:36,935
Let's see our first lesson
that we can refer today from

31
00:01:36,965 --> 00:01:38,135
and start with a small video.

32
00:01:38,634 --> 00:01:41,934
So I don't see if you noticed, but there's
a timer around the top left of the video.

33
00:01:42,324 --> 00:01:46,524
This means that at this point,
red Bull has under 23 minutes

34
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:50,554
to do something so that the car
is able to to be driven by Max.

35
00:01:50,855 --> 00:01:51,935
So what's happening here?

36
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:53,645
So Red Bull needs to make a decision.

37
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:57,125
They either go into the pit lane or
they try to fix the car on track.

38
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,589
So they need to make a fast
decision and they have very

39
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,250
little information at this point.

40
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:07,000
They have sensory information and the
feedback that Max has been giving them.

41
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,170
So no mechanic.

42
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,990
No mechanic has ever has seen the cardiac.

43
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,410
So although they understand that they
probably have a broken suspicion, they

44
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,030
don't really know what's in there.

45
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,870
So by making this decision, if
they go into the pit lane, they

46
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,650
have everything there, there's
their garage, all their tools are

47
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,090
there, all their parts are there.

48
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:29,655
But if the race, when the race
starts, Marx start, max starts last.

49
00:02:30,105 --> 00:02:33,555
If they do it on a track, they lose
four minutes, but, and they have to take

50
00:02:33,555 --> 00:02:37,575
everything in there, so they need to make
a fast decision with limited information.

51
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:41,405
So they need to act decisively even
if they don't have the full picture.

52
00:02:41,585 --> 00:02:42,365
Why is that?

53
00:02:42,605 --> 00:02:44,395
They want to minimize exp impact.

54
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:48,325
They act fast and they want
to stop small problems from

55
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:50,095
becoming big couches in our world.

56
00:02:50,185 --> 00:02:54,685
It's this worry that we need to
act fast before a small incident

57
00:02:54,685 --> 00:02:56,335
becomes a very big outage.

58
00:02:56,755 --> 00:02:59,575
Also, in our context, we need
to protect our customers.

59
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:02,125
We need to protect their assets and.

60
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:07,345
Everything that we own from them, of
course, come from a company perspective.

61
00:03:07,405 --> 00:03:08,845
We want to preserve revenue.

62
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:13,695
These the quick actions that we do reduce
downtime and reduce our financial losses.

63
00:03:13,755 --> 00:03:15,855
And of course, we want to
maintain customer trust.

64
00:03:15,885 --> 00:03:18,495
Customers need to understand that
we are in control and we're doing

65
00:03:18,495 --> 00:03:20,125
our best to solve the incident.

66
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,590
As engineers, we need to become
comfortable with this discomfort.

67
00:03:23,715 --> 00:03:23,775
It.

68
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:28,095
And we also need to keep in mind that
many of these decisions will oftentimes be

69
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:31,065
sub suboptimal or even completely wrong.

70
00:03:31,365 --> 00:03:36,345
So using F1 as an example, they,
no mechanic has ever even seen

71
00:03:36,345 --> 00:03:39,305
the car, and they decided to go
to the track and fix it there.

72
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:41,065
Let's see what they did next.

73
00:03:41,565 --> 00:03:45,685
As we can see here red Bull
is moving everything from

74
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:46,915
their garage into the track.

75
00:03:47,275 --> 00:03:50,815
So you see everyone speaking
clearly very commonly.

76
00:03:51,025 --> 00:03:54,175
So people are asking for tools,
people are asking for parts.

77
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:55,675
People are asking who is doing what.

78
00:03:55,675 --> 00:03:57,955
So it's very clear, so
there's no confusion.

79
00:03:58,075 --> 00:04:01,580
People are speaking in a
calm voice and very clearly.

80
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,520
So clear communication.

81
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,820
It's all about sharing the
right information with the

82
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,500
right people at the right time.

83
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:12,265
This will lead to faster
resolution of sance.

84
00:04:12,565 --> 00:04:15,625
Clear communication will get
everyone on the same page.

85
00:04:16,195 --> 00:04:18,655
This will reduce efforts
because good communication will

86
00:04:18,655 --> 00:04:20,515
prevent confusion and mistakes.

87
00:04:21,265 --> 00:04:24,625
It of course, improve coordination
because everyone will be working

88
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:28,075
together to fix an incident and
it'll increase transparency.

89
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,645
Open communication will keep everyone
informed and will build trust.

90
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:35,775
So takeaways from here from this
good communication helps everyone

91
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,845
understand and resolve incidents faster.

92
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:42,695
It will allow for everyone to be in the
loop and mentoring just during incidents,

93
00:04:42,695 --> 00:04:44,795
be them with stakeholders or clients.

94
00:04:45,295 --> 00:04:46,345
Let's see what comes next.

95
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:51,105
So as you can see here, we see an engineer
asking for a front wing, and immediately

96
00:04:51,105 --> 00:04:55,035
someone who's coordinating the incident
just raise the awareness that they

97
00:04:55,035 --> 00:04:56,985
have clear processes to do everything.

98
00:04:57,165 --> 00:05:00,225
So this means that they should
follow a predetermined process

99
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:01,545
to actually fix the car.

100
00:05:02,295 --> 00:05:03,255
Why is this important?

101
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:08,835
So clear processes are, it's all about
following defined steps that will help

102
00:05:08,835 --> 00:05:11,275
us be effective in incident resolution.

103
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,210
By following these processes,
we can enable a faster response.

104
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,270
This will enable quick rea
reactions to incidents.

105
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,740
It'll reduce chaos so everyone knows
what should be, do the what shape they

106
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,770
should be doing and at time, so they,
this will bring some order and will

107
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,420
prevent confusion during an incident.

108
00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:32,835
It, of course, will enable
consistent execution.

109
00:05:32,985 --> 00:05:37,065
These processes will ensure that incidents
are handled every time in the same

110
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:38,775
way, and it'll improve collaboration.

111
00:05:39,015 --> 00:05:42,075
Everyone understands their part, everyone
understands what they should be doing,

112
00:05:42,195 --> 00:05:45,525
so it'll be making clear that person
A and person B should be cooperating.

113
00:05:46,485 --> 00:05:49,275
So we need to plan for incidents
before they happen, right?

114
00:05:49,335 --> 00:05:52,850
So we need to try to do, to have
these processes defined and we need

115
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,680
to try them, we need to test them out.

116
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,860
We need to have simulations
how these are done.

117
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,390
And by doing that, these clear
steps will make for a fast response.

118
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,750
So next we talk a little
bit about teamwork.

119
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,830
Let's, so let's see an example.

120
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,650
As you guys can see here, it's a bit
a little bit of the process of taking

121
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,710
stuff into the into the track and
communicating what should be done.

122
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:16,180
So if there's no good teamwork
there, this would be possible.

123
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,390
They are literally transferring
a garage onto the track.

124
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:24,990
So collaboration and shared responsibility
will allow for a faster resolution.

125
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,160
So there's a diverse skill
set for faster fixes.

126
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,160
So different people will be,
bring different strengths for to

127
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,440
incident response, and they need
to cooperate and work together.

128
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,780
Of course, teamwork makes a dream work.

129
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,230
Collaboration will lead to small,
smoother, and faster resolution.

130
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,310
Everyone plays a part and they need
to understand in their processes

131
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,960
where they should be leaning into.

132
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,570
And of course, we will all learn together.

133
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,340
Teams that learn from incidents together
will get better together, so teams that

134
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,320
work together solve problems faster.

135
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,810
There's not one person who
fixed a whole incident.

136
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,590
It's a teamwork, and of course,
teamwork builds more resilience and

137
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,210
more effective response to incident.

138
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,445
Next we talk about columnists.

139
00:07:05,465 --> 00:07:06,365
So let's see an example.

140
00:07:06,865 --> 00:07:10,795
So at this point, red Bull has
under seven minutes to get a car

141
00:07:10,945 --> 00:07:13,215
running ready to be driven by Max.

142
00:07:13,765 --> 00:07:16,345
So you hear communication,
you hear no one screaming.

143
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:17,605
Everyone keeping calling.

144
00:07:17,765 --> 00:07:20,785
You hear Jonathan Whitley
asking for updates, right?

145
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:21,715
He's not screaming.

146
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:22,885
He's very calm.

147
00:07:23,005 --> 00:07:26,365
He knows that his engineers
are under enormous pressure.

148
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:30,655
They need, they not only need to get
a car fixed, they're going, they're

149
00:07:30,655 --> 00:07:32,455
having a car that's going to be driven.

150
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,630
And over 300 kilometers an
hour for 50, 60, 70 labs.

151
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:43,840
So it's not only about fixing the car and
making it run, it needs to be driven at

152
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,500
fast fast speeds under immense g forces.

153
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,590
So they need to nail this
right and Max will trust them.

154
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:55,590
So keeping calm, it's all about think
and post under pressure to be able to

155
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,840
think clearly and make good decisions.

156
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:03,750
If we have a calm mind, it means that we
can, that calmness can help us have, make

157
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,820
good decisions during the whole incident.

158
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,020
Of course, calm teams work better without
the other pressure of someone screaming

159
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,980
or someone asking constant feedback.

160
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,710
It'll reduce stress and will
help everyone to work better.

161
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:19,320
We have to stay tough in this, the, in
these situations we have, we need to

162
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,100
build our mental strengths to be able to
handle the strengths of these incidents.

163
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,860
So we should tr we should have
simulations before of actually

164
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,660
doing these things to actually
build that toughness over over time.

165
00:08:30,215 --> 00:08:31,925
And we don't need to rush, right?

166
00:08:31,985 --> 00:08:34,895
So we need to take as much
time as necessary to assess

167
00:08:34,895 --> 00:08:36,035
and plan before taking action.

168
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:39,195
Like I said before, they not only
need to assemble the car, but they

169
00:08:39,195 --> 00:08:42,375
need to keep in mind that someone
will be driving that car over 300

170
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,135
kilometers an hour for 67, 80 times.

171
00:08:45,945 --> 00:08:48,945
So a coal mine will make the
better decisions during incidents.

172
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,080
So we need to train our teams to
handle these stress situations.

173
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,760
So by simulating these situations
before so for example, in our

174
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,960
world, it'll be using game days
or using chaos engineering.

175
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,130
We will start to build that toughness
and their that control during incidents.

176
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,790
Next, we touch on technical proficiency.

177
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,930
So at this point, this is more
on the beginning of the incident.

178
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,970
Red Bull is assessing if
they can do it or not.

179
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,820
So they basically are saying
that they need to do it faster

180
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,740
than they ever done it before.

181
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,630
So this means very high
technical proficiency.

182
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,190
So they need strong skills to
be able to efficiently diagnose

183
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,510
and resolve the incident.

184
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,350
So in an incident, skills
will matter, right?

185
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,590
If you have strong skills,
they will be essential for a

186
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,120
quick and effective incident.

187
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,720
Resolution.

188
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,370
In an incident.

189
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,630
Knowledge will be power.

190
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,600
The more a team knows about
incidents, about their systems,

191
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,990
they will be better equipped to
prevent and handle those incidents.

192
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:49,240
And as F1 drivers, our teams needs
to be, need to be sharp, hone their

193
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,160
skills and train them over time.

194
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,630
So stronger technical skills means
that stronger, a stronger incident

195
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,260
response, and teams will need the
right tools to empower them to

196
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,030
resolve incidents effectively.

197
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,900
Last but not least, we have postmortems.

198
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,045
So let's see an example here.

199
00:10:05,545 --> 00:10:09,715
So for Formula One, teams are
famous for doing brutal postmortems.

200
00:10:09,745 --> 00:10:13,665
And when I say brutal, it means
that they go into very detailed

201
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:15,165
of what happened during the race.

202
00:10:15,195 --> 00:10:18,315
They're famous for doing not only
when things go wrong, but also

203
00:10:18,315 --> 00:10:19,815
when things go right as well.

204
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,975
So they really want to
understand how things went.

205
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:25,955
In this video, we saw an example
from the Mercedes, a MG team.

206
00:10:26,165 --> 00:10:29,525
They are very public about their
postmortems to the extent of what

207
00:10:29,525 --> 00:10:32,525
they can divulge, of course, without
compromising themselves and giving

208
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:33,995
secrets to their competition.

209
00:10:34,955 --> 00:10:39,635
So postmortems, it's all about learning
from incidents to prevent future problems.

210
00:10:40,235 --> 00:10:43,145
So after an incident is resolved,
we want to find the root cause.

211
00:10:43,205 --> 00:10:47,855
We want to dig deep and understand why an
incident happened, not just what happened.

212
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:48,935
So we want to understand the why.

213
00:10:48,935 --> 00:10:50,555
Why did this thing happen?

214
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,320
Also and very important, we
want to learn from mistakes.

215
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,520
We want to use incidents as opportunities
to improve processes and prevent

216
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,290
that incident doesn't happen again.

217
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,140
Very important is that we
have no blame postmortems.

218
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,190
We need to focus on learning and
improvement, not on blaming someone.

219
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,710
Postmortems will help teams learn from
incidents and get better over time.

220
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,970
They need to be focused on fixing
problems, not finding fault.

221
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,210
So why is this important?

222
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,960
At the end of the day,
here's what we want.

223
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,030
We want to prevent
incidents from happening.

224
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,170
When an incident happens, we
want to meet again, mitigate and

225
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,880
fix them as fast as possible.

226
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,830
And of course, we want that.

227
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,135
The same incidents don't
happen over and over again.

228
00:11:35,635 --> 00:11:38,635
Unfortunately, many organizations
don't have many of these

229
00:11:38,635 --> 00:11:40,110
practices that we see in mind.

230
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,830
But as we could see here, some of
the top engineering organizations in

231
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,750
the world do this because it works.

232
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,920
So either if you and independently, if you
like F1 or not we can all agree that F1

233
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,880
is one of the top engineering disciplines
in the world and these are the things

234
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,250
that they do to actually fix an incident.

235
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,600
And if I had to start somewhere,
I would start with postmortems.

236
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,320
Postmortems.

237
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,240
It's all about learning, right?

238
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,430
Learning from what happened.

239
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,000
And I think that postmortems will
help you develop all the others

240
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,520
because when you have an incident,
you do postmortem, you'll learn,

241
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,960
you understand, you will over time
will build the other capabilities

242
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,490
because you are constantly learning.

243
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,660
So at the end, what happens, let's see.

244
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,470
So let's take a moment here
to understand what happened.

245
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:25,790
So Max crashed his car, the radio
formation lap in under 20 minutes.

246
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,430
The mechanics transferred
their garage onto the track.

247
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:34,550
They fixed the car, and that allowed
Max to go from seventh into second.

248
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,840
This is amazing, right?

249
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,950
So all of these skills and all of these
items that you see during the presentation

250
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:45,210
allow for someone who had a broken car
and in under 20 minutes had a car able to

251
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,870
be driven to go from seventh to second.

252
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,130
This is simply amazing.

253
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,190
So here are just a few links
if you want to learn a little

254
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:55,040
bit more about this incident in
particular and see the whole video.

255
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,330
So the first one is the video.

256
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,710
So the video is roughly eight
minutes, but it's, it was reading it.

257
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,660
So the second link is about that grand
Prix that we just saw that was in Hungary.

258
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:07,130
And the third one is the Mercedes
a MG channel that has a lot of

259
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:10,760
forced postmortems that you can
see and see how they handle them.

260
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,310
And this is all for my part.

261
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,320
I hope you enjoyed it and I hope
to see you again in another day.

262
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,420
Thank you very much, and
follow me on my socials.
