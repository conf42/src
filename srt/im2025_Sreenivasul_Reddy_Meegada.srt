1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,260
Welcome to this conference.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,060
So my name is Rindi Ada, so I
work for Blue Cross Blue Shield,

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,110
love Michigan as a technical lead
and then a solutions architect.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,979
So today's session is to cover about
the wise parametrics in the healthcare

5
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:19,589
right and how secure the vice parametric
is and how can we streamline the

6
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:25,689
workflows with the new vice paramedics
technology to the healthcare, right?

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,930
The healthcare organizations enter in, in
the world, like facing a crisis, right?

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,369
So it's, they have a lot of data breaches,
everything that's getting breach as we all

9
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:38,989
know what is happening in the market and
more of what the data breaches compromised

10
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:41,119
in millions of patients records, right?

11
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,619
So if you are you'll be surprised
one to see like how much.

12
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:47,269
The data breaches.

13
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:50,119
Why healthcare and when
compared with the banks, right?

14
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:52,944
So if you look at the black market, right?

15
00:00:52,994 --> 00:00:58,234
Whereas for the general card information,
the credit card information, if

16
00:00:58,234 --> 00:01:03,194
it's like $5 but whereas the black
market, so the healthcare record, each

17
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:06,464
record is around like two $50, right?

18
00:01:06,464 --> 00:01:10,844
So it'll be very surprised to, or
shocking to to know that information.

19
00:01:10,844 --> 00:01:12,134
But it's accurate, right?

20
00:01:12,824 --> 00:01:17,984
So that's why most of the cyber
criminals target the healthcare industry.

21
00:01:18,524 --> 00:01:24,039
So that's where we need to ensure we
have right security, and also we are

22
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:30,149
maintaining all the security models in
the healthcare to, to ensure the data

23
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:36,554
related to the to the related to the
U user is accurately available, right?

24
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:39,854
So we don't want to, we don't want any
breaches into the healthcare environment.

25
00:01:40,544 --> 00:01:43,514
So with that said, so let's
go into more details, right?

26
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,944
So the next one is, what is the need?

27
00:01:46,184 --> 00:01:49,454
Why, what is the critical
need and why do we need that?

28
00:01:49,514 --> 00:01:52,994
In, in, in the enhanced, like with
the, in the healthcare security, right?

29
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:55,694
So there's, as I mentioned earlier, right?

30
00:01:55,694 --> 00:01:58,454
So cyber criminals are targeting
the healthcare industry.

31
00:01:58,934 --> 00:02:00,554
So because some of the.

32
00:02:01,214 --> 00:02:05,954
Some of the open challenges is like users
having the weak authentication processes

33
00:02:05,954 --> 00:02:12,374
and the practices and password base, which
is very inadequate to protect, right?

34
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,955
It's a older way of authenticating, right?

35
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:16,925
And when it comes to
unique challenges, right?

36
00:02:16,925 --> 00:02:20,555
So healthcare operation, very
high pressure environment, right?

37
00:02:20,555 --> 00:02:24,965
So where it, it has access to the critical
information, so live death and everything.

38
00:02:25,465 --> 00:02:29,245
All of this information, so the
clinicians required, and whenever,

39
00:02:29,245 --> 00:02:31,855
like it needs to be secured, right?

40
00:02:32,245 --> 00:02:34,585
So these emergency situations like
where traditional authentication

41
00:02:34,585 --> 00:02:36,805
creates dangerous delays, right?

42
00:02:37,165 --> 00:02:40,315
And some of the senior consequences,
like medical identity theft, can

43
00:02:40,315 --> 00:02:43,825
lead to incorrect treatments and
also some of insurance frauds.

44
00:02:44,245 --> 00:02:48,130
Author access can result in the
altering the stolen record, right?

45
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,890
And also prescriptions or
disrupt critical care operations.

46
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,260
So with that, say, let's go to
the next slide, which is the

47
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,310
evaluation of biometrics totally
in the healthcare industry,

48
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,990
specifically to the authentication.

49
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,770
So the biometric authentication
represent a fundamental shift from

50
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,660
the knowledge based security, right?

51
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,075
So if you look at the current market
or a current environment where majority

52
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:16,285
of the people are, wanted to have the
knowledge base authentication, right?

53
00:03:16,285 --> 00:03:20,775
So we're having the contract numbers,
date of birth, zip codes, all of

54
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:23,305
that data as a security, right?

55
00:03:23,665 --> 00:03:26,785
But if you all look at it, like
some of the data is already

56
00:03:26,785 --> 00:03:28,625
available in the internet, right?

57
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:33,255
So anyone would be able to pull the
data and should be, and we'll be able

58
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:36,375
to authenticate or as you, right?

59
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,770
So that's where we need to.

60
00:03:39,645 --> 00:03:44,145
We need to ensure, like we have
some new methods of authenticating

61
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:45,375
in the healthcare, right?

62
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:48,774
So there's are different
types of biometrics, right?

63
00:03:48,774 --> 00:03:51,325
Like the finger fingerprints,
which is leveraged in the,

64
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:52,765
some of the pharmacy accesses.

65
00:03:53,214 --> 00:03:56,755
And at the same time you have the
facial recognitions and also area

66
00:03:56,755 --> 00:03:59,755
spanning, and the same way, like
a palm in authentication, right?

67
00:04:00,385 --> 00:04:03,804
But out of all of these, so
the interesting one would

68
00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:05,004
be like wise biometrics.

69
00:04:05,664 --> 00:04:09,534
So it has significantly be,
this are significant changes in

70
00:04:09,534 --> 00:04:11,294
the wise biometrics technology.

71
00:04:11,844 --> 00:04:14,844
Which is currently leveraged in
majority of the organizations.

72
00:04:15,304 --> 00:04:19,084
Which can be leveraged for authenticating
the members or authenticating the

73
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:23,544
employees within the healthcare
and streaming the workflows using

74
00:04:23,544 --> 00:04:26,395
the standard wise of the customers.

75
00:04:26,395 --> 00:04:31,525
So the advantage of this is the
customer doesn't need to carry the.

76
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:36,085
The traditional contract
number, data, birth, the

77
00:04:36,414 --> 00:04:38,335
employee card everywhere, right?

78
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:40,825
So it doesn't need to be carried, right?

79
00:04:41,424 --> 00:04:45,595
So some of the key applications,
which can be leveraged which of the

80
00:04:45,655 --> 00:04:50,065
which of these can be leveraged is
like the access control staff, right?

81
00:04:50,395 --> 00:04:52,945
And the same way the fraud
prevention insurance claims.

82
00:04:53,395 --> 00:04:56,485
And at the same time, why metrics
in the contract center, right?

83
00:04:56,585 --> 00:04:58,490
Some of the benefits of this is like the.

84
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:00,725
Build security, right?

85
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:03,485
Reduced errors and also the same line.

86
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,330
It does streamline the workflows
and enhance the patient's

87
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,680
trust at the same time.

88
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,860
This is gonna have a lot of
cost savings in the environment.

89
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,385
And I we understand, like when we
look at the broader picture, right?

90
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:18,675
So there are some challenges, right?

91
00:05:18,675 --> 00:05:21,515
Everything is not like a
smooth in in, in the new.

92
00:05:22,385 --> 00:05:23,195
Technology, right?

93
00:05:23,195 --> 00:05:25,985
We need to look at from different
perspectives and we also need to

94
00:05:25,985 --> 00:05:27,605
understand what are the challenges, right?

95
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:30,395
So some of them will be like,
there, some of the privacy concerns

96
00:05:30,695 --> 00:05:33,900
and some of them will be bias and
accuracy of the authentication in

97
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,430
the healthcare with these adoptions.

98
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,170
And there'll be some
adoption barriers as well.

99
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,140
And also at the same time,
the regulations and standards.

100
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,750
So the biometric revolution in healthcare
is not, about the security, right?

101
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,320
It's about creating safer and
more personalized and efficient

102
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,545
healthcare so that, that's where
the wise biometrics is getting

103
00:05:54,545 --> 00:05:56,415
adopted in the healthcare industry.

104
00:05:56,915 --> 00:06:00,995
So we need to understand, so there
is a perception how, regarding

105
00:06:00,995 --> 00:06:05,315
the adoption wise biometrics is.

106
00:06:05,815 --> 00:06:09,145
Might have some other
challenges like fraud.

107
00:06:09,355 --> 00:06:13,295
But whereas if you understand
this technology more, right?

108
00:06:13,295 --> 00:06:16,355
So it's not like a wise print, right?

109
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:20,495
So there's a lot of factors that
are taken into consideration when

110
00:06:20,885 --> 00:06:22,955
this technology create a wise print.

111
00:06:23,455 --> 00:06:28,380
So some of them are like the
physiological foundation, so where

112
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,350
every individual person have a
unique vocal signature, right?

113
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,840
So it's vocal card, like article
gon, there's a lot of variations

114
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,000
in every unique voice, right?

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,020
There's a pattern.

116
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,790
So that, that, that's unique
to every person and there is a.

117
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,755
Behavioral pattern, right?

118
00:06:46,755 --> 00:06:51,435
So the habits of pronouncing the pattern
like a speech and innovation that

119
00:06:51,435 --> 00:06:53,385
develops over years of language, right?

120
00:06:53,715 --> 00:06:57,885
So all of these, including some of the
advanced processing behind the scenes,

121
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:02,235
like the modern security systems will be
leveraged like the fundamental frequency,

122
00:07:02,235 --> 00:07:06,285
like the spectral distribution, all of
these, including the machine learning

123
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,745
in order to create a wide sprint.

124
00:07:09,675 --> 00:07:11,835
So this is going, this is.

125
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,820
With all of these patterns, right?

126
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,910
Or the signs of the technology.

127
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,790
It always the unique voiceprint will
be created for every user, right?

128
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,585
So it's not like someone can
impersonate my voice so that the

129
00:07:26,085 --> 00:07:30,705
false accept would be very less if
you use the wise biometric solution.

130
00:07:31,205 --> 00:07:34,565
So now we also need to look at
it from the enterprise scale

131
00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:35,945
implementation, the healthcare.

132
00:07:36,445 --> 00:07:40,104
So there's a lot of deployments,
processes available, right.

133
00:07:40,104 --> 00:07:44,004
But as we always mentioned,
or we always plan to, right?

134
00:07:44,004 --> 00:07:47,545
We need to secure the wise to make
sure we are going with the right

135
00:07:47,545 --> 00:07:48,744
technology in the environment.

136
00:07:49,244 --> 00:07:53,504
So some of them, like we have to do
some pilot before we move, before

137
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:54,719
we migrate to the wise biometrics.

138
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,199
Identify all the challenges
because challenges, some of them

139
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,529
are unique to the platform, right?

140
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:05,669
And our techno and our application or our
environment or our organization, right?

141
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:09,269
So we need to ensure we learn
ahead of time what are those

142
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:10,289
challenges are going to be.

143
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:14,859
So that would be smoother
transition of the implementation.

144
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,010
And we also need to understand what are
the infrastructure preparations, right?

145
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,490
What is the network or the bandwidth
or the, what is the redundancy we

146
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:27,300
are going to have and at the same
time, continuing the performance

147
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,739
monitoring and the improvements.

148
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,520
And change management, right?

149
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,429
We, it's very crucial, right?

150
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:36,209
So we need in the environment to make
sure we have the right operational

151
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:37,889
efficiency and the patient safety.

152
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:41,739
So the same, if you look at the,
some of the measurable impacts

153
00:08:41,739 --> 00:08:42,909
on the clinical operations.

154
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:47,394
So the, what are the, so the,
based on a recent survey, right?

155
00:08:47,934 --> 00:08:51,994
So with the wise P implementation
in the clinical operation, there

156
00:08:51,994 --> 00:08:55,444
is a, there is authentication
time reduction of 83%, right?

157
00:08:55,444 --> 00:09:00,244
So generally the knowledge based
authentication as we previously discussed.

158
00:09:00,814 --> 00:09:04,684
So it's more like a traditionally
asking, Hey, what is your unique id?

159
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:06,304
What is your date of birth?

160
00:09:06,454 --> 00:09:07,804
What is your social security?

161
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:08,524
All of that.

162
00:09:08,524 --> 00:09:10,024
But with this new.

163
00:09:10,524 --> 00:09:12,024
Wise biometric technology.

164
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:15,264
So why something can like
manual credential entry.

165
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:19,525
We don't need to enter the
manual manually, all the

166
00:09:19,765 --> 00:09:20,935
credentials entries, right?

167
00:09:21,055 --> 00:09:24,115
So the, with the wise biometrics,
it's going to leverage your wise to

168
00:09:24,115 --> 00:09:25,915
authenticate and then just keep moving.

169
00:09:25,944 --> 00:09:30,085
It And at the same time, there's
also 67% support request.

170
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:31,705
Reduce reduction, right?

171
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:34,435
Some of them, majority of them
are related to the authentication.

172
00:09:34,795 --> 00:09:38,785
So where the member, where the
clinic clinician or the customer

173
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:41,515
try to authenticate if their
wise is not matching right?

174
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:41,815
Sorry.

175
00:09:42,145 --> 00:09:44,454
If the member if the clinician
tried to authenticate and some of

176
00:09:44,454 --> 00:09:46,045
these clinician doesn't work right.

177
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:48,954
So the, basically the knowledge
base, so majority of them will

178
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:50,275
be calling the customer care.

179
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,625
So for the support to look into the issue.

180
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,465
But with this biometric you'll not be
running into those challenges, right?

181
00:09:56,465 --> 00:10:00,925
So when you have a higher user
satisfaction rate because clinic

182
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:02,245
clinical operations, right?

183
00:10:02,245 --> 00:10:04,835
So it's very critical for
the, in the healthcare, right?

184
00:10:04,835 --> 00:10:08,285
So it's more like how much
satisfied your healthcare staff is.

185
00:10:08,645 --> 00:10:12,305
And at the same time, this will
increase the overall efficiency

186
00:10:12,305 --> 00:10:13,955
gain in the workflow process.

187
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:16,595
So there, these are some
of the measurable impacts.

188
00:10:17,045 --> 00:10:22,195
We have noticed in the clinical operations
and at the same time, so we have a

189
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:28,055
lot of platforms, our customers or the
providers available in the market, right?

190
00:10:28,745 --> 00:10:33,485
So we all need to make sure we
are going with the right product.

191
00:10:33,575 --> 00:10:39,155
So there are multiple products in
the market, so we all need to, so

192
00:10:39,395 --> 00:10:43,475
whenever there, there's a consideration
to make it to the wise biometrics.

193
00:10:44,285 --> 00:10:49,265
We as organization, we need to take
a look at it or assess what are the

194
00:10:49,685 --> 00:10:51,575
products that are available in the market.

195
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:57,625
And at the same time we need
to see what is what product can

196
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:02,695
work with our applications or the
integrations within the IVR, right?

197
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,040
Or the self-service.

198
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,270
And at the same time, at the CRMs, which
is like the main critical one for the csr.

199
00:11:08,975 --> 00:11:13,835
So we need to see which product is more
reliable and which can provide more

200
00:11:13,835 --> 00:11:17,945
accuracy with less false positives, right?

201
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,255
So that's the assessment
that needs to be done.

202
00:11:20,355 --> 00:11:24,345
And we also need to look at which
of these providers support some of

203
00:11:24,345 --> 00:11:27,015
the historical enrollments, right?

204
00:11:27,015 --> 00:11:31,665
Some of the previously recordings
available in the previous platform

205
00:11:31,995 --> 00:11:34,095
can be leveraged to enroll the.

206
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:39,540
Customers or clinicians so that when
they call next time, instead of enrolling

207
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,650
them again, we can be authenticated,
which is trying to gain an efficiency.

208
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:49,010
So at the same time, we need
to ensure we are following all

209
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,720
the HIPAA compliance, right?

210
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,820
So all that is main critical
for any of the healthcare.

211
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,310
So we need to make sure we are
following all the HIPAA complaints

212
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,930
when we try to integrate the
wise biometric solution, right?

213
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,050
So the next one is the challenges.

214
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:07,010
So there'll be a lot of technical
challenges, as we all know, right?

215
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,340
None of the product is a
hundred percent perfect, right?

216
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,640
But we need to see which, which
works for our organization.

217
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,000
Some of the technical challenges
is the nice environment, right?

218
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,150
So when you try to authenticate,
if there is background noise, so

219
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:25,060
then system, sometimes you may
not be I of getting a voice match.

220
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,620
You may get a voice mismatch, right?

221
00:12:27,385 --> 00:12:29,805
At the same time, as we all know, right?

222
00:12:29,805 --> 00:12:34,395
Doing when we are ill or very
great, so Wise will be different.

223
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,075
Little bit at the same system.

224
00:12:36,075 --> 00:12:39,275
We might have some challenges
in authenticating you.

225
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,525
And some of the organization
challenges are, we need to take a

226
00:12:41,525 --> 00:12:44,635
look at it software, like how much
the licensing cost is and how much

227
00:12:44,635 --> 00:12:49,715
is the training and the expenses
and what is that professionals like.

228
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,840
Workflows, disruptions, the
migrations and some of the regular

229
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,430
regulatory challenges is like privacy
concerns wise, web metrics, right?

230
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:02,180
We need to be very careful and
in attention to the compliance.

231
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:06,000
Some of the regulatories
are HIPAA and bpa and GDPR.

232
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:11,520
Some of these there are specific
requirements, so we need to ensure the

233
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:17,190
organization, we involve the primacy
and security team when we are coming up

234
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,810
with a lot of this strategy discussion.

235
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,660
We all need to make sure there's some
adv, some other mitigations is right?

236
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:28,205
So we need to balance it out whether we
wanted do threshold with a high match or

237
00:13:28,205 --> 00:13:33,575
whether we wanted to authenticate even if
the response came back as medium or a low.

238
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,810
Which all depends on how
you do the configurations.

239
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,590
And we also need to have
need to see what the.

240
00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:41,515
Business requirement is and
need to look at it like a

241
00:13:41,515 --> 00:13:43,045
multimodal authentication, right?

242
00:13:43,045 --> 00:13:45,055
Providing some of the
backups with the KPAs.

243
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:49,305
And we need to ensure we are following
all the right privacy policies and the

244
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:53,655
data requirements and where the data
is getting stored and at the same time.

245
00:13:53,655 --> 00:13:56,865
So we also need to look at deploying
in a phased approach rather than

246
00:13:56,865 --> 00:13:58,295
going in a single deployment.

247
00:13:58,795 --> 00:14:02,575
So some of the best practices
is pre rollout assessment.

248
00:14:02,965 --> 00:14:05,275
So we need to do a, we need to be very.

249
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:06,255
Planning.

250
00:14:06,255 --> 00:14:09,795
So some of these planning needs
to happen ahead of time, right?

251
00:14:09,795 --> 00:14:13,665
So we need to understand what is the
kind of comprehensive site surveys, so

252
00:14:13,665 --> 00:14:16,935
the infrastructure audits and the user
interviews and technical testing to

253
00:14:16,935 --> 00:14:22,335
identify potential challenges before
implementation and multimodal integration.

254
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:25,875
So we need to ensure some of the
backup options are available, so when

255
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:29,235
authentication fails, so in case of
wise authentication fails, we need to

256
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:33,585
switch back a failover to knowledge
based authentication without impacting.

257
00:14:34,085 --> 00:14:36,635
Clinical staff or the
members of the customers.

258
00:14:36,635 --> 00:14:39,875
And then from the deployment perspective,
we had to go in a phased approach.

259
00:14:40,415 --> 00:14:43,685
So with a very department
selected department for

260
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:45,575
testing, like a performance.

261
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,935
So there'll be opportunity for
tuning the application, right?

262
00:14:48,935 --> 00:14:50,510
So based on our environment.

263
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,590
At the same time, comprehensive training
needs to be performed to all the

264
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:59,770
users so that everyone understand the
criticality so that we can have, so the

265
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:04,990
right ROA is returned with the wise, with
these solutions and some of the, as I

266
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,430
mentioning earlier the security and the
benefits of the compliance advantages.

267
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,815
So it really, it does eliminate
the password vulnerable days.

268
00:15:12,315 --> 00:15:13,425
Wise cannot be easily stolen.

269
00:15:13,475 --> 00:15:17,555
So someone cannot take your voice
and try to authenticate you as you.

270
00:15:17,705 --> 00:15:23,005
So the system has is system would
automatically understand whether it's a

271
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:25,645
human talking or it's automated mission.

272
00:15:25,645 --> 00:15:29,635
So the same time some of the prevention
of the credential sharing, right?

273
00:15:29,635 --> 00:15:33,805
So whereas some of the credentials
are stolen, are shared.

274
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:38,125
So that's where now using the
Y makes this a common practice.

275
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,930
So now it is like non
address capabilities.

276
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:44,500
So it does create an indisputable
records of system access, user

277
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,830
actions, and the transaction
approvals that cannot be disputed.

278
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:52,800
So some of the complaints advantages
is, so it does provide a detailed

279
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,090
logging for user authentication, like
a granular access capabilities, which

280
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,730
are required for HIPA regulation, right?

281
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:04,110
So the technology strong authentication
s another unauthorized access.

282
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,180
So to in order to meet the compliance
reporting, so some of the principles of

283
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:14,430
least privileges system support, fine
grain access controls based on user

284
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,950
identity roles and the time of access in
order to meet the regulatory requirements.

285
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,129
So there are some privacy things
we need to take into control when

286
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:26,020
we are designing, like making
sure the customers are aware, like

287
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,050
we are gonna leverage their wise
for authentication or enrollment.

288
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:32,289
So there are some of the templates
which are available, right?

289
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:37,929
So that can be leveraged for as a
sample and global compliance, right?

290
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:42,639
So flexible architecture needs to be
planned to require while maintaining

291
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,189
consistent security capabilities
across the global organization.

292
00:16:46,344 --> 00:16:50,694
So some of the future trends and
technology advance advances we are

293
00:16:50,694 --> 00:16:53,754
seeing is like AI advancements,
where that's the buzz word.

294
00:16:53,754 --> 00:16:55,224
We are hitting everywhere, right?

295
00:16:55,899 --> 00:17:00,899
So there would be an, a quick learning on
the algorithm that is getting obtained,

296
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:06,589
which does improve the wise patterns
in order to reduce the false mismatches

297
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:11,129
during the when the user is having an
illness or emotional stage, at the same

298
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:15,029
time, like natural language processing,
it is like more sophisticated, like

299
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:16,529
reducing the training requirements.

300
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:18,349
As edge computing, right?

301
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:21,199
So which does relate to the privacy
concerns by managing any of the

302
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,859
data transmission and IO ot, right?

303
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:28,210
Like the integrations which does
monitoring the equipment and ensuring

304
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:32,260
the right controls are available in
order to meet the security requirement.

305
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,260
And the continuous authentication right
system continuously verifies whether the

306
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:42,320
users are getting authenticated rightly,
or if there is any imposters who are read.

307
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,670
Trying multiple times to authenticate
or impersonate, at the same time,

308
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,790
enhancing the technology, right?

309
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,820
And the next one is the path forward.

310
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:55,780
So the watch P metrics is a very
transformative opportunity, right?

311
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:56,830
In the healthcare industry.

312
00:17:56,889 --> 00:18:00,730
The technology is unique combination
of strong authentications, but we

313
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,460
need to ensure we are implementing
the right workflows are getting

314
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:08,379
integrated, and there is evidence of
from enterprise scale deployments that.

315
00:18:08,995 --> 00:18:12,445
Efficiency, the security and the
user satisfaction justify the

316
00:18:12,445 --> 00:18:13,524
implementation of the investment.

317
00:18:13,524 --> 00:18:17,944
However, successful implementation
requests, careful planning adequate

318
00:18:17,944 --> 00:18:22,594
resources, sustained commitment to address
technical challenges, user adoption

319
00:18:22,594 --> 00:18:24,364
issues, and declaratory requirements.

320
00:18:25,174 --> 00:18:29,104
So why of them is deployment is a very
comprehensive change shift from the

321
00:18:29,604 --> 00:18:33,999
historical knowledge base authentication
and leveraging technology to lever to,

322
00:18:34,944 --> 00:18:36,594
to leverage wise for the authentication.

323
00:18:37,224 --> 00:18:40,704
So this is a very huge shift from
the traditional KB authentication.

324
00:18:41,364 --> 00:18:44,964
So some of the recommendations
is the comprehensive assessments.

325
00:18:45,474 --> 00:18:49,824
So as we need to ensure, we do
evaluate security requirements, right?

326
00:18:49,824 --> 00:18:53,885
We need to ensure the privacy and security
teams are involved and identify all the

327
00:18:53,885 --> 00:18:56,014
use cases and what are the challenges.

328
00:18:56,014 --> 00:18:59,105
We are going to run into
the same time pilot program.

329
00:18:59,675 --> 00:19:02,389
So we need to go in a phased approach
of deploying the capabilities.

330
00:19:02,889 --> 00:19:06,969
That does minimize the risk and
resource commitments and making sure

331
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:10,179
the regulatory planning engage all
the legal and compliance experts

332
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:13,899
to ensure the implementation
meets the regulatory requirements.

333
00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:18,309
And some of the strategic planning
is the first rollout with appropriate

334
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:19,479
resource and executive support.

335
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:23,370
So that's where we need to be very
good planning so that you don't,

336
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,380
so that implementation will be
smoother if the planning is not good.

337
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,540
We run into a lot of challenges
during the implementation.

338
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,000
So that's all related to
this particular session.

339
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,570
I hope this will be helpful for
you and if you have any questions,

340
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,420
please feel to feel free to
reach out to me on the LinkedIn.

341
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,460
And thanks everyone.

342
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,650
Thanks for giving me this opportunity.
