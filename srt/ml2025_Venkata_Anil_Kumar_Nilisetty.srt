1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,090
Good morning or good afternoon everyone.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:10,230
My name is Kuman and I bring with me
over 15 years of experience in robust

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,840
scalable enterprise applications.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,370
I'm currently working as a
manager at Cognition Technology

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,990
Solutions US Core, where I lead
innovative technology solutions to

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,180
solve complex business problems.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,040
Today I'm excited to be here
to present my conference on.

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,360
Transforming supply chain, smart
logistics and fleet management

9
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,550
through event driven microservices.

10
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:43,290
Today I'm going to walk you through how
we can transform supply chain operations

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:50,100
using event driven microservices, a
scalable, intelligent, and architecture

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,070
that's already delivering measurable
impact in logistics and fleet management.

13
00:00:56,834 --> 00:01:03,944
We are going to move beyond buzzwords
and look at real world outcomes, lower

14
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:10,545
costs, faster operations, and smart
additions, all enabled by modern tools

15
00:01:10,545 --> 00:01:13,725
like Kafka, Kubernetes, and Springboard.

16
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:18,975
The problem with traditional mic,
traditional logistic systems.

17
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:24,975
Let's start with the reality Logistics
operations are under intense preserve.

18
00:01:25,695 --> 00:01:32,685
High delivery expectations, rising
fuel costs and complex urban routing.

19
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:41,054
At 60 to 80% of IT budgets in this sector
go toward maintaining legacy systems.

20
00:01:41,655 --> 00:01:47,715
These monolithic systems are
slow to update, often taking four

21
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:53,235
to six hours of minor changes,
vulnerability, vulnerable to downtime.

22
00:01:54,255 --> 00:01:56,565
Two to three hours per update cycle.

23
00:01:57,855 --> 00:02:03,555
Poor at scaling performance drops
drastically beyond thousand users.

24
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:13,125
And on top of that, and on top of that,

25
00:02:15,195 --> 00:02:20,145
data security concerns and
lack of digital readiness make,

26
00:02:20,145 --> 00:02:22,414
transform make transformation.

27
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:24,124
Incredibly difficult

28
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:29,674
for this.

29
00:02:29,704 --> 00:02:32,764
We have designed our
solution into microservices.

30
00:02:33,784 --> 00:02:37,759
Why microservices even microservices.

31
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:43,009
Because microservices enabled
independent deployment fee.

32
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:47,959
Deployment of features can scale
dynamically based on demand.

33
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,159
And also our fault.

34
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:51,929
Fault, tolerant.

35
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:53,369
And resilient.

36
00:02:53,879 --> 00:03:00,719
Although real time evil processing,
which is crucial for logistics, we

37
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:07,109
have built this using Spring Boot
for modular development, Kafka

38
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:12,419
for event streaming and Kubernetes
for auto scaling and resilience.

39
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:21,089
Event driven, a architecture,
high correlation accuracy, low

40
00:03:21,089 --> 00:03:24,089
latency and disruption detection,

41
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:31,739
core use cases, fleet and logistic
modernizations among them.

42
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,359
One is real time GPS
tracking implementation.

43
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:41,399
Traditional GPS systems
are passive and often lag.

44
00:03:42,059 --> 00:03:49,229
We implemented a hybrid active
passive tracking model that provides

45
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:55,169
five to 10 meter accuracy in cities
and 15 to 20 meters in rural areas.

46
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:05,069
Kafka processes up to 25,000 updates per
vehicle per hour with 95% transmission

47
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:08,009
success even in poor signal areas.

48
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,254
And coming to Edge, competing
for traffic management.

49
00:04:12,704 --> 00:04:19,484
Our edge competing setup processes,
vehicle speed behavior, and violations on

50
00:04:19,484 --> 00:04:22,364
the edge, not on the, not in the cloud.

51
00:04:23,144 --> 00:04:26,414
That is 85 milliseconds.

52
00:04:26,564 --> 00:04:33,524
Response for speed violations, one 20
milliseconds for complex vehicle behavior.

53
00:04:33,884 --> 00:04:37,304
This reduces false alarms and.

54
00:04:37,724 --> 00:04:41,684
Cuts bandwidth usage by up to 78%.

55
00:04:43,304 --> 00:04:45,284
EEA route optimization.

56
00:04:45,704 --> 00:04:53,174
We use historical data, realtime traffic,
and customer windows to dynamically

57
00:04:53,414 --> 00:05:02,114
reroute delivery deliveries with a
result of 40% pasture road planning,

58
00:05:02,504 --> 00:05:04,809
25% more deliveries per vehicle.

59
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:08,489
Up to 20% reduction in the vary costs.

60
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:12,719
What is the performance
and business impact?

61
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:15,659
Here is the results.

62
00:05:15,809 --> 00:05:21,179
We are seeing 45% reduction in
vehicle breakdowns, 25% lower

63
00:05:21,179 --> 00:05:24,509
in maintenance costs, 98.5%.

64
00:05:24,869 --> 00:05:33,449
Fleet tracking accuracy drivers
improved to 35% better driving behavior.

65
00:05:33,884 --> 00:05:39,074
30% fewer accidents and 20%
drop in insurance premiums.

66
00:05:39,434 --> 00:05:43,214
All told for a fleet of a
hundred vehicles, this system

67
00:05:43,214 --> 00:05:45,974
saved over three 50 K annually.

68
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,424
Just from fuel and maintenance

69
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:54,824
warehouse and urban logistic improvements.

70
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:58,364
Smart logic sticks isn't
just about vehicles.

71
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:00,749
It's about warehouses too.

72
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:11,039
We reduce picking times by 38% in
by 38% in using intelligent order.

73
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:17,879
Batching improved space utilization
by 42% through realtime inventory

74
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,669
management and in carbon delivery.

75
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:24,779
Last mile delivery cost dropped by 30%.

76
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:28,079
Carbon emissions reduced by 28%.

77
00:06:28,544 --> 00:06:35,449
Thanks to intelligent road planning and
load consolidation, the scalability and

78
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:38,624
reliability and architecture benefits.

79
00:06:38,894 --> 00:06:40,994
Let's talk about the infrastructure.

80
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:47,504
Our Kubernetes based architecture
allows horizonal scaling Autoscale spots

81
00:06:47,504 --> 00:06:55,004
between three to 10 instances, maintains
70% CPU usage, cost optimization.

82
00:06:55,094 --> 00:07:01,154
Ensurers, 99.95 uptime
even during updates.

83
00:07:01,694 --> 00:07:09,224
We also use service shedding to prevent
cascading failures, active replication to

84
00:07:09,224 --> 00:07:12,194
recover from outages in under 30 seconds.

85
00:07:12,554 --> 00:07:16,469
That is what modern
resilience look like, right?

86
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:23,804
Even driven microservices
are not just a tech trend.

87
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:29,579
They are strategic advantage in the
digital supply chain by shifting

88
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,919
monolithic to modular systems.

89
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:37,919
From static to real time processing,
and from human guesses to a additions.

90
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:42,899
We are all reshaping the way
goods move through the world.

91
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:49,139
This transmission is not optional, it's
essential, and it's already happening.

92
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,029
Thank you so much.
