00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,820
Hello, everyone, and thank you
for joining today's session.

2
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:05,139
My name is Siraj.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,590
We'll be exploring how containerization
and Kubernetes have transformed

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,290
the way we develop, deploy,
manage applications in the cloud.

5
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:21,590
This talk is especially important in the
context of IOT, where number of devices is

6
00:00:21,709 --> 00:00:24,740
exploding, data volumes are skyrocketing.

7
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,520
We'll see how these technologies
tackle scaling challenges, improve

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,140
efficiency, and enable rapid innovation,
both in traditional IT environment.

9
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,310
And the edge where IoT devices operate.

10
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:39,800
Let's get started.

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,199
we'll, discuss briefly
about the containerization.

12
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,269
what it means is like it packages
an application code, libraries,

13
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:50,509
and all dependencies together.

14
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:54,389
Ensuring it runs the same way
across different environment,

15
00:00:54,669 --> 00:00:56,839
development, testing, production.

16
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:01,629
Think of container as a sealed
box that includes everything

17
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:03,399
your app needs to function.

18
00:01:04,169 --> 00:01:09,719
For IoT, this means software running
on edge devices or gateways can

19
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,119
be developed and tested on laptop,
then deployed confidently in the

20
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:15,909
field without compatibility issues.

21
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:21,459
Popular tools include
Docker, Podman, and CRM.

22
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:26,359
So, like there are definitely a lot
of advantages using containerization.

23
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:29,829
the first one would be the portability.

24
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:36,800
it helps us to move from on premises setup
to cloud or edge environment effortlessly.

25
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,039
And next is consistency.

26
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:44,250
the application environment is identical
everywhere, reducing it works on.

27
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,150
My machine problem.

28
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,790
What it means is like
before containerization.

29
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:55,390
The problem was like, once a developer
developed any software, so it was

30
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:00,050
working fine on his machine, but not
on the real production environment.

31
00:02:00,089 --> 00:02:03,329
So the reason was there might be
some mismatch in the libraries.

32
00:02:03,809 --> 00:02:08,510
So all those kind of issues will
not happen here in dockerite

33
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,060
or in containerization.

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,829
And obviously they are lightweight.

35
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:12,179
Okay.

36
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:18,640
So they can start within seconds,
enable quick updates and scaling, and

37
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,359
coming to the scalability, it is easy,
easily spin up more containers to handle

38
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:29,400
additional load from surge in IoT sensors
data during peak time, like festival

39
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,450
or sporting event in the smart city.

40
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:35,150
These benefits help IoT deployment evolve.

41
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:39,965
rapidly without sacrificing
stability or performance.

42
00:02:40,055 --> 00:02:45,185
So now, as as the containers are growing,
as the applications are growing, the

43
00:02:45,235 --> 00:02:47,765
containers as well growing, right?

44
00:02:47,805 --> 00:02:50,485
So we need something to
manage those containers.

45
00:02:50,524 --> 00:02:52,705
That's where Kubernetes come into play.

46
00:02:53,434 --> 00:02:57,435
So Kubernetes is the
orchestration layer that automates

47
00:02:57,465 --> 00:02:59,415
managing containers at scale.

48
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:04,365
It schedules, scales and maintain the
health of containerized application.

49
00:03:05,095 --> 00:03:06,785
Removing a lot of manual overhead.

50
00:03:07,035 --> 00:03:12,425
For IoT scenarios, Kubernetes can
coordinate multiple services from

51
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:17,644
data ingestion at the edge to
centralized analytics, ensuring that

52
00:03:17,644 --> 00:03:22,265
if one component fails, another is
automatically restarted or replaced.

53
00:03:22,694 --> 00:03:27,154
Key features include self healing,
horizontal scaling based on

54
00:03:27,164 --> 00:03:30,035
demand, And built in load balancing

55
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:31,175
in the cloud.

56
00:03:31,415 --> 00:03:33,815
Kubernetes simplifies orchestration.

57
00:03:34,065 --> 00:03:38,214
Imagine trying to manage
thousands of containers by hand.

58
00:03:38,555 --> 00:03:40,555
It's error prone and time consuming.

59
00:03:41,135 --> 00:03:45,254
Kubernetes automates scaling
up and down as devices.

60
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:50,715
As device numbers fluctuate, ensures
resilience if hardware fails,

61
00:03:50,945 --> 00:03:52,855
work across different providers.

62
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:59,424
For IoT data pipelines, Kubernetes can run
analytics workload in different regions

63
00:03:59,424 --> 00:04:02,215
or clouds, preventing vendor lock in.

64
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:07,555
This flexibility is crucial as
IoT deployments scale globally.

65
00:04:08,055 --> 00:04:12,144
So yeah, let's discuss, innovation
driven by containerization.

66
00:04:12,974 --> 00:04:15,614
So the first one is
microservice architecture.

67
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:21,714
Instead of large application, we'll
break it into the small focus on services

68
00:04:22,575 --> 00:04:27,435
in iot that mean, that might mean
separate services for data ingestion,

69
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:32,004
separate service for pre-processing,
and machine learning, inter interface.

70
00:04:32,504 --> 00:04:34,385
And efficient resource use.

71
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:39,864
What it means is multiple services share
the same infrastructure without conflicts.

72
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:43,075
Crucial for resource
constrained edge environment.

73
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,494
and it helps in DevOps enablement.

74
00:04:46,814 --> 00:04:50,374
Rapid and continuous integration
and deployment pipelines keep

75
00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:52,924
IoT software updated and secure.

76
00:04:53,424 --> 00:04:59,484
And it quickly test new IOT, it help
us to like, definitely quickly test

77
00:04:59,894 --> 00:05:05,554
and deploy IOT features like anomaly
detection on sensor data without

78
00:05:05,584 --> 00:05:07,344
worrying about environment setup.

79
00:05:07,844 --> 00:05:11,134
So Kubernetes is widely used
across different domains.

80
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:16,564
Enterprise applications like banks,
healthcare system, retailers rely on

81
00:05:16,624 --> 00:05:19,944
Kubernetes for stable, scalable platforms.

82
00:05:20,704 --> 00:05:23,094
Kubernetes native development.

83
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:28,419
So startup leverage Kubernetes to
handle millions of concurrent users

84
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:33,639
and tools like Spark run efficiently
under Kubernetes helping analyze

85
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:39,409
massive IoT data sets and it helped
in AI and ML pipelines, model training

86
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:44,349
and interface scale up automatically
as data streams from IoT devices

87
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,359
increases and IoT deployment.

88
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:50,299
This is key for our audience today.

89
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:57,434
As IoT devices proliferate, smart
city sensors, industrial robots,

90
00:05:57,514 --> 00:06:02,634
autonomous vehicles, Kubernetes manages
containerized services at scale.

91
00:06:03,424 --> 00:06:08,949
It can autoscale to handle Growth
in connected device and data, bring

92
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:14,619
processing closer to the edge for faster
response time, essential in real time

93
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:16,949
IoT scenarios like traffic control.

94
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:22,669
Efficiently run multiple applications
on the same hardware, saving resources,

95
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,589
enable rolling updates of software on
thousands of devices simultaneously.

96
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:32,899
Support hybrid and multicloud
strategies to process IoT data where

97
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:35,229
it makes the most sense on prem.

98
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,289
So let's discuss about a few case studies.

99
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:45,419
So while not strictly IoT focus, so
let's focus on this Spotify story

100
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,789
shows the power of Kubernetes at scale.

101
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,259
They needed to handle
millions of concurrent users.

102
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:55,959
By adopting Kubernetes, they transformed
their monolithic setup into microservices.

103
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:00,699
They gain the agility to roll
out updates faster, improve user

104
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:02,969
experience, and control costs.

105
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:05,149
The same principles apply to IoT.

106
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:09,019
As your device count and data
volumes grow, Kubernetes helps

107
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,169
maintain performance and reliability.

108
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:16,659
Despite its benefits, Kubernetes
isn't without challenges.

109
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:17,729
Complexity.

110
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:19,849
Kubernetes has learning curves.

111
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:23,499
Engineers need training
to use it effectively.

112
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:27,779
And for monitoring and debugging,
understanding what's happening in

113
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:33,709
large IoT ecosystems spread across
edge devices and cloud requires robust

114
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:36,219
tools like Chrometheus, Grafana.

115
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:40,529
And coming to the security,
protecting IOT data is critical.

116
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:44,079
Ensuring containers and
clusters are secure and up

117
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:46,489
to date is a constant effort.

118
00:07:46,989 --> 00:07:47,939
Cost management.

119
00:07:48,749 --> 00:07:54,419
So scaling too aggressively or running
unused containers can inflate cloud bills.

120
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,689
Careful planning ensures resource
match actual IOT workload.

121
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:04,519
In a world where number of connected IOT
devices is exploding and data is flowing

122
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:11,273
from countless sources, containerization
and Kubernetes form a powerful foundation

123
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:16,029
for managing complexity and scaling,
scaling efficient, effectively.

124
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,549
As IOT systems become more
sophisticated, combining edge

125
00:08:20,549 --> 00:08:26,449
computing, AI and big data analytics,
this technology ensures agility,

126
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:28,399
resilience and cost effectiveness.

127
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:28,589
Thanks.

128
00:08:29,484 --> 00:08:33,524
yeah, a small startup experiment
with a small IoT application

129
00:08:33,574 --> 00:08:34,964
and scale it gradually.

130
00:08:35,544 --> 00:08:36,654
upskill your team.

131
00:08:37,234 --> 00:08:41,044
So invest in Kubernetes training
so your engineers can confidently

132
00:08:41,074 --> 00:08:42,604
manage these environments.

133
00:08:43,244 --> 00:08:45,044
So consult with experts.

134
00:08:45,554 --> 00:08:47,984
If you are new to this,
partner with consultants who

135
00:08:47,984 --> 00:08:49,634
can guide your IoT journey.

136
00:08:50,174 --> 00:08:53,954
Adopt best practices like
follow security hardening.

137
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:58,499
Monitoring and cost optimization
strategies to realize the full

138
00:08:58,499 --> 00:09:03,249
potential of containers and
communities in iot by embracing

139
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:05,449
containerization and communities.
