00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,500
Hello everyone, my name is Anil Kheri
and today we are gonna talk about how

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:12,660
healthcare can be changed using Salesforce
Health Cloud and how we can revolutionize

3
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,789
healthcare delivery using the CRM Cloud.

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,750
So over the past few years, as we all
know, healthcare sector has been under

5
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:24,559
immense pressure to, to enhance patient
care while improving personal efficiency.

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,460
So this discussion is based on a
comprehensive study on multiple

7
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,450
clients who has delivered,
their, health, healthcare, using

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,250
health cloud, infrastructure.

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,720
so this is being conducted
between 2022 to 2024, across

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,220
multiple healthcare facilities.

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,310
So, you know, it examines how
the implementation of Salesforce

12
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,690
health cloud has transformed care.

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:58,480
So, let's talk about, let's start
with the challenges healthcare,

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,270
organizations face today.

15
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,640
So, these include fragmented patient
data, inefficiencies in care coordination,

16
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,580
delayed response time, and care
gaps that can lead to complication.

17
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,200
Additionally, healthcare systems
struggle with operational inefficiencies,

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,889
resource mismanagement, and
compliance with stringent regulations.

19
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,800
These challenges not only affect
patient outcomes, but also

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,560
burden healthcare providers with
rising cost and inefficiencies.

21
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:32,120
So our study analyzed Salesforce
health data cloud implemented across

22
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,300
diverse healthcare environments and
produced some remarkable results.

23
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:43,530
So if you see here, the patient case
satisfaction, scores has increased by 26.

24
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,809
4%, so which rose from 78
to 91 in the first year.

25
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:51,360
Facilities where Facilit, the Health Cloud
was used and also the care coordination,

26
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:57,340
which means the time spent on care
coordination was reduced by 75%, from

27
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,220
48 hours to, 12 hours, enabling faster
interventions and better outcomes.

28
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:07,770
And also based on response time, the
response times were reduced by 83%.

29
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,790
So that means the communication
between the provider's office

30
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,510
and the patients have reduced
significantly, when people were using.

31
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:22,430
So this, this also, you know, we can
also say that, people who are using

32
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,680
health cloud were also implementing AIs
in, in giving their responses or, you

33
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,620
know, in, providing claims, so that you
don't have to talk to an actual person,

34
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,090
for, for your, issues to be resolved.

35
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:40,060
So you can just probably chat with
an AI bot, when, you know, you have

36
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,009
certain queries with your, users.

37
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,550
with your provider.

38
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:50,870
So, and also, if you look at like,
there is a care gap, identification.

39
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:58,770
So in, in that also the times have
reduced, significantly, from, like there

40
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,590
is an increase in the gap, which, which,
which, which enabled healthcare providers

41
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:07,250
to take preventive actions and deliver
more holistic and personalized cares.

42
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,390
And also.

43
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,040
The key additional, performance
indicators, as I said, you, the

44
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,690
response time, has been increased,
has been decreased, and also the care

45
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,760
gap identification has been increased.

46
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,080
So what are the critical, success factors?

47
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,830
So, the critical, success factors,
here are comprehensive staff

48
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,350
training, phased deployment
approach, and cross, collaborations.

49
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,360
So the comprehensive So the
training programs, increased the

50
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,640
system and operation rates by 85%.

51
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,870
Within six months, ensuring teams could
fully utilize the platform capabilities.

52
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,100
And also, by rolling out the
system in stages, starting with

53
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:53,100
pilot programs, organizations
reduced disruptions by 75 percent

54
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,510
compared to the traditional methods.

55
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,580
And also the cross function collaboration
alignment between IT, clinical, and

56
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,110
administrative teams ensured that this.

57
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,590
that needs all of stakeholders,
were paved away for smoother

58
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,850
implementation and operation.

59
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,080
So by this, what happened with the
cross functional collaboration, what

60
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,130
happened was that people who were
using different systems were under one,

61
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,320
under one, one umbrella, which was the
healthcare, the health cloud platform.

62
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,840
so what happened in this is they
were able to easily communicate and

63
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,200
get answers from cross, cross teams.

64
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,790
so the dependency

65
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:36,840
So, this is the practical implementation
framework and also I want to

66
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:43,380
talk about, like how healthcare,
how, Salesforce played a critical

67
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,570
role, in, achieving these results.

68
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,680
So 360 degree patient view.

69
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,990
So by consolidating patient data
into a single view, providers were

70
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,900
able to deliver more personalized
care and proactive care management.

71
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,020
Automated alerts and reminders help
prevent care gaps, ensuring patients

72
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,660
stayed on track with their care plans,
and also streamline communication,

73
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,390
securing messaging between care team
members, improve coordination, enabling

74
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:14,960
Seamless communications and reducing
errors and also data driven insights.

75
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:19,130
So powerful analytic tools within
health cloud supported better

76
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,090
clinical decision making and enabled
providers to identify patterns and

77
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,970
trends and areas for improvement.

78
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,850
So the health cloud matrices, were
giving a lot of, insights, to the,

79
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,180
provider, from the patient's previous
So they don't have to go through like

80
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,970
each and every notes that they had.

81
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,690
But, you know, they were able to,
look in a confide report form or

82
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,850
a dashboard form and then get much
of the information from there.

83
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,320
So beyond improving, care, Health Cloud
delivered substantial operational and,

84
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,450
compliance, benefits, such as, you
know, automation, reducing redundancies

85
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,460
and improved, resource allocations,
leading to a 32 percent reduction in

86
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,880
operational overhead in the regulatory
compliance, built in security.

87
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:10,040
Features, HIPA compliant data management
and role based access controls

88
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,570
and regular compliance training.

89
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,700
Ensure patient data, were protected,
and adherence to regulations.

90
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,390
These features were critical in
building trust with patients and

91
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,280
safeguarding sensitive information.

92
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,460
So the call to action.

93
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:30,755
So, so if you see here, how, how
can, healthcare organizations.

94
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,340
Replicate this success, like
who are not using CRM is

95
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,540
assessing their current systems.

96
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,600
where, you know, start by evaluating
the existing workflows, identifying

97
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:46,170
inefficiencies and understanding the
needs of the organization and also to

98
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,950
engage stakeholders, stakeholders, which
include clinical administrative and it

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,620
teams early in the planning process to
ensure alignment and buy in and also

100
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:01,380
to develop a tailored, strategy, You
know, customizing, the health cloud

101
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,540
implementation to meet their unique needs.

102
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,380
and, the organization needs.

103
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,390
And also commit to the, continuous
improvement, regularly gather feedback,

104
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,670
and also, you know, analyze performance
metrics and refine, processes

105
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,410
to sustain, long term benefits.

106
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:19,850
So, I just want to, conclude saying
that Salesforce Health Cloud has

107
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,640
proven to be a game changer for
healthcare, you know, significantly.

108
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,220
improving patient outcomes,
enhancing operational efficiencies,

109
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,360
and streamlining compliance.

110
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,620
So by leveraging this CRM technology,
healthcare organizations can not only

111
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,220
meet today's challenges, but also
future proof their systems for tomorrow.

112
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,030
And, thank you, everybody.
