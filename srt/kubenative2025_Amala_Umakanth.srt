00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,340
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:05,090
Welcome you all to this session,
generative AI Transforming

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,410
Healthcare Claims Processing.

4
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:08,330
I'm Amala Ala Oma.

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,129
I work as a junior principal data
engineer at a management consulting firm.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,620
I partner with our clients in leading data
architecture and digital transformations

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,370
by building scalable and robust data
pipelines at an enterprise scale.

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,870
It's a pleasure to be here
at Con 42 Q, native 2025.

9
00:00:27,815 --> 00:00:32,255
Today I'll be sharing my views on how
gene AI is transforming healthcare

10
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:36,785
claims processing space, especially
in speeding up operations, improving

11
00:00:36,785 --> 00:00:41,435
accuracy and detecting frauds in ways
traditional systems simply cannot.

12
00:00:42,245 --> 00:00:43,745
Let's dive into the challenge first.

13
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:46,649
The healthcare claims
ecosystem is massive.

14
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:51,569
Tens of millions of claims are
submitted, reviewed, and processed.

15
00:00:51,974 --> 00:00:56,025
Every single day across several payers,
providers, and insurance companies.

16
00:00:56,805 --> 00:01:01,514
Unfortunately, the system is so
fragmented, slow, and highly error

17
00:01:01,514 --> 00:01:06,364
prone due to the fact that how these
systems are built and managed claims

18
00:01:06,364 --> 00:01:12,304
essentially move through multiple layers
of processing, like eligibility, coding,

19
00:01:12,454 --> 00:01:15,695
validation, adjudication, and audits.

20
00:01:16,294 --> 00:01:19,924
Each step introduces potential
for errors or delays.

21
00:01:20,779 --> 00:01:27,019
According to recent studies, nearly
15% of claims are either denied or

22
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:33,409
delayed because of various reasons like
incorrect data, missing documentation, or

23
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:39,439
inconsistent codes, and then this fraud
ranging from upcoding to phantom billing

24
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,359
to collusive networks of providers.

25
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:47,239
These issues cost the healthcare industry
over a hundred billion dollars annually.

26
00:01:47,809 --> 00:01:51,859
Traditional rule-based systems
cannot adapt fast enough to

27
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:53,689
detect evolving patterns.

28
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:56,479
That's where gene AI comes into picture.

29
00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:01,149
Gene, I introduces a paradigm
shift almost in every industry.

30
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,100
The healthcare industry is no exception.

31
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,680
Unlike fixed rule automation, gene, I
systems learn from vast and diverse,

32
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,644
unstructured and semi-structured data.

33
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:15,625
Like claims text, EHR, records,
image, billing nodes, et cetera.

34
00:02:16,075 --> 00:02:19,495
It also generates context
aware and explainable insights.

35
00:02:20,094 --> 00:02:24,505
Let's break it down to see what makes
it transformative in top three aspects.

36
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:30,885
Number one, the speed AI agents can
process and validate claims in seconds

37
00:02:30,915 --> 00:02:36,464
nowadays, it streamlines the most time
consuming manual process like data entry,

38
00:02:36,704 --> 00:02:38,355
verification, and prior authorization.

39
00:02:38,855 --> 00:02:42,665
This reduces the administrative
burden on providers and expedites

40
00:02:42,665 --> 00:02:44,555
the payments in one case.

41
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:48,695
Generic model, increased
automated claim processing by 30%,

42
00:02:49,115 --> 00:02:50,765
resulting in faster approvals.

43
00:02:51,335 --> 00:02:52,445
Number two, accuracy.

44
00:02:53,345 --> 00:02:58,145
General leverages natural language
processing and contextual understanding to

45
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:00,575
reduce coding errors and mismatch entries.

46
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:05,495
This ensures coding, accuracy and
completeness before a claim is submitted.

47
00:03:05,945 --> 00:03:09,875
This minimizes human error
resulting in higher first pass

48
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,705
claim rate and fewer denials.

49
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:14,615
And third, the proactive fraud detection.

50
00:03:15,115 --> 00:03:17,095
AI analyzes large data sets.

51
00:03:17,425 --> 00:03:21,955
To correctly identify the subtle and
suspicious billing patterns or anomalies

52
00:03:21,955 --> 00:03:26,185
in the data that even humans or rule
engines often miss in traditional road

53
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:31,225
based systems By flagging questionable
claims in real time, genea helps

54
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:35,515
insurers prevent financial losses
and strengthen system integrity.

55
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:40,945
So instead of humans chasing anomalies,
the AI continuously watches and

56
00:03:40,945 --> 00:03:44,965
learns, making it a dynamic and
innovative and regulated system.

57
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:48,615
Let's look at the five
layer architecture here.

58
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,215
Each layer contributes to speed,
accuracy, and explainability.

59
00:03:52,635 --> 00:03:57,555
Before we dive any deeper, here's a high
level of these three, these five layers.

60
00:03:58,245 --> 00:04:00,525
The first layer is the data
ingestion and pre-processing.

61
00:04:01,185 --> 00:04:05,355
In this layer, the workflow cleans
and normalizes the fragmented inputs.

62
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:09,405
The second layer is the intelligent
semantic under understanding.

63
00:04:10,005 --> 00:04:11,085
This is the core layer.

64
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:11,825
Here.

65
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:15,755
The gene AI interprets the data
using natural language processing

66
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,765
to build accurate claim context.

67
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,925
Third layer is the decision engine.

68
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:24,245
Here, the workflow automates
the adjudication recommendations

69
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:25,535
and flag any outliers.

70
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:27,935
The fourth layer is the
validation and explainability.

71
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:32,875
This layer ensures transparency,
auditability, and trust, enabling

72
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,465
comprehensive compliance.

73
00:04:34,855 --> 00:04:37,255
And the final layer is the
integration and analytics.

74
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:41,545
This layer connects the pipeline to
enterprise systems and dashboards

75
00:04:41,755 --> 00:04:43,495
to deliver real time impact.

76
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:47,515
Let's look at each layer
a little more deeply.

77
00:04:48,015 --> 00:04:52,155
The biggest barrier we know in any data
pipeline is the data fragmentation.

78
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,805
Claims come in several formats,
like PDFs and hhl, seven

79
00:04:56,805 --> 00:04:58,725
messages or even DICOM images.

80
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:04,515
Gene consumes data in all of these formats
and converts them into structured data

81
00:05:04,515 --> 00:05:09,225
for downstream processing the ingestion
pipeline performs data cleaning,

82
00:05:09,285 --> 00:05:13,635
deduplication, and enrichment as part
of the data, pre-processing steps.

83
00:05:14,135 --> 00:05:18,875
Think of it as laying a solid
foundation without clean, unified data.

84
00:05:19,055 --> 00:05:22,325
No AI model can deliver
real reliable outcomes.

85
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:26,525
Once we have clean data, the next
challenge is understanding what

86
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:30,275
the data actually means, and that's
where the NLP comes into picture.

87
00:05:30,775 --> 00:05:35,065
Many of us have seen or heard medical
data, and it's not a simple text.

88
00:05:35,305 --> 00:05:39,745
It's full of medical codes, aberrations
context, and clinical nuances.

89
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,620
The second layer leverages natural
language processing to extract meaning

90
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,360
from these codes and aberrations.

91
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,070
JI reads, physician notes, discharge
summaries, and claim narratives.

92
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,170
Then it identifies entities like
diagnosis codes, procedures, and

93
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,990
medications, and it does not stop there.

94
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,480
It goes on building the
contextual understanding.

95
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,460
For example, it can distinguish
between a follow-up visit for diabetes.

96
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,950
Versus a new diagnosis for diabetes.

97
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,490
There is a subtle difference that
affect the billing accuracy in these two

98
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,560
scenarios, and the result is a claim that
is enriched with semantic intelligence

99
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,420
ready for automated decisioning.

100
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,890
Next is the third layer that
is validation and enrichment.

101
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:28,980
Here JI validates claims against
coding standards like ICD 10 CPT,

102
00:06:28,985 --> 00:06:33,930
and Ed ct it crosschecks medical
necessity provide credentials

103
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,850
and historical patient patterns.

104
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:40,920
The enrichment process then adds
auxiliary data, like clinical references,

105
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:46,200
lab results, or previous medical
encounters, thus creating a 360 degree

106
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,060
view of each and every single claim.

107
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,290
The goal here is not to just reject
back claims, but to improve the

108
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,000
equality before shop submission.

109
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,790
And the fourth layer is
a decision intelligence.

110
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,540
This layer handles what's known
as AI driven adjudication.

111
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,400
Let's see how this happens.

112
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,230
Once the claim is validated, the
decision engine determines whether to

113
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,570
approve, deny, or flag it for review.

114
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,740
It uses reinforcement learning to
get better with each iteration,

115
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,670
meaning the system improves
continuously from expert feedback.

116
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:22,320
We also use precision exception
handling, which means identifying

117
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,190
those edge cases that cannot be
decided or acted upon confidently

118
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,215
and routing them to human reviewers.

119
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:31,830
This brings human in the loop
along with the AI workflows.

120
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,440
The hybrid approach of AI with human in
the loop ensures both speed and trust.

121
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,980
This brings to the final
layer orchestration.

122
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,820
In this layer, the entire
ecosystem is tied together.

123
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:49,560
Consider this as a control plane that
coordinates the various AI models.

124
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,730
External data sources and business
rules required to automate and

125
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,290
expedite the claims adjudication.

126
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,660
It manages the APIs, the performance
metrics, and integrations with enterprise

127
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,670
workflows, whether that's paper payer
systems, or EHRs or analytic dashboards.

128
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,000
The orchestrator incorporates
quality control measures.

129
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:12,915
It can flag claims with high
risk factors for human review.

130
00:08:13,185 --> 00:08:17,745
Compare AI generated summaries against
source documents for accuracy, and even

131
00:08:17,745 --> 00:08:21,225
create a feedback loop to continuously
improve the model's performance.

132
00:08:21,885 --> 00:08:26,595
It provides continuous monitoring,
auditing, and traceability, which are

133
00:08:26,595 --> 00:08:30,135
the key requirements for regulated
environments like healthcare.

134
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:34,115
Now let's talk about the real
differentiator, the fraud detection,

135
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:37,505
how fraudulent claims are captured
in the traditional systems.

136
00:08:38,235 --> 00:08:43,215
The answer to this question depends
on the codified static business rules

137
00:08:43,605 --> 00:08:48,255
that captures thresholds like flag if
the amount is greater than X dollars or

138
00:08:48,255 --> 00:08:50,415
duplicate claim within 30 days, et cetera.

139
00:08:50,915 --> 00:08:55,145
However, fraud evolves so quickly,
often this slightly changing patterns.

140
00:08:55,145 --> 00:08:59,105
To bypass those rules, genea
brings multimodal analysis.

141
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:04,010
This means it combines a structured
data, claim, narratives, and behavioral

142
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:09,230
signals simultaneously in order to detect
the suspicious activity proactively.

143
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:14,480
By integrating these different data types,
the system gains a more comprehensive

144
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,490
understanding than any single source
could provide, leading to more accurate

145
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,200
and efficient claims adjudication.

146
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,060
It can identify sophisticated fraud
patterns even before human auditors.

147
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,750
Notice them and send the notification
to the right person to act on it.

148
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:34,970
For example, the most complex and hard
to detect patterns are often worried in

149
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,930
unstructured data, like clinical notes,
doctors letters, and claim description.

150
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:43,610
NLP could actually reveal a hidden
pattern in these unstructured data,

151
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:48,080
like when the description of a
patient in the insurance claim uses

152
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,790
inconsistent language, conflicting with
the factual medical records or hidden

153
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:57,290
linguistic cues such as repeated use
of qualifying statements, et cetera.

154
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,270
The emerging fraud schemes,
frauds and fraudsters have

155
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,800
evolved well over the years.

156
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,480
In our study, we identified three major
classes of these evolving fraud schemes.

157
00:10:08,064 --> 00:10:10,015
Number one, the pattern evolution.

158
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:14,245
Fraudsters modify known scams
just enough to slip through rules.

159
00:10:14,745 --> 00:10:19,965
Example, scammers now use gene AI to
create falsified medical records, such

160
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:25,125
as altered MRI scans, x-rays, or clinical
nodes to support your fraudulent claims.

161
00:10:25,515 --> 00:10:29,595
This makes detecting fraud much
more challenging as the supporting

162
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,515
documentation appears so legitimate.

163
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:37,125
Using realtime monitoring the JI
workflows claims as they're submitted,

164
00:10:37,365 --> 00:10:40,845
allowing for immediate intervention
before fraudulent payments are dispersed.

165
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:42,945
Next is the collusive networks.

166
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:47,475
This means the providers and patients
coordinate claims across institutions.

167
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:52,125
In this case, we use network
intelligence where this technology maps

168
00:10:52,155 --> 00:10:53,745
relationship between the providers.

169
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,020
Patients and clinics to
identify collusive fraud rings.

170
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,760
It can detect patterns like multiple
providers sharing the same address or

171
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,040
referring patients in circular patterns.

172
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,410
And third one is a behavioral anomalies.

173
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,360
Tiny shifts in billing or diagnostic
frequency that reveals the abuse of fraud.

174
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:16,485
We use behavioral analytics to
capture these types of fraud schemes.

175
00:11:16,965 --> 00:11:19,065
Example, a machine learning model.

176
00:11:19,065 --> 00:11:21,345
Identify anomalies in billing patterns.

177
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:26,025
By establishing a baseline of normal
behavior for each provider, any

178
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:30,585
significant deviation from that baseline
such as a certain spike in claims

179
00:11:30,585 --> 00:11:34,215
for a specific high cost procedure
can be flagged for investigation.

180
00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:39,525
JI continuously monitors for these
signals using unsupervised learning

181
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:41,805
clustering and pattern evolution analysis.

182
00:11:42,305 --> 00:11:46,175
Another innovative capability is
synthetic fraud scenario generation.

183
00:11:46,745 --> 00:11:50,855
It involves creating a fake identity
to submit a claim for reimbursement.

184
00:11:51,455 --> 00:11:55,595
The synthetic identity is typically
created by combining a stolen

185
00:11:55,595 --> 00:11:59,765
social security number with
fabricated personal details, making

186
00:11:59,765 --> 00:12:02,675
it difficult for the automated
systems to even detect the fraud.

187
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:07,025
Using generative modeling, we can
simulate fraudulent claims to stress

188
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:10,715
test the detection pipeline to
protect against these future threats.

189
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:15,035
This approach helps the system to
learn from possible future fraud

190
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:18,575
events, even before attackers,
thereby improving resilience,

191
00:12:18,575 --> 00:12:20,405
adaptability, and system integrity.

192
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:24,355
Let's look at the challenges
in implementing the AI

193
00:12:24,715 --> 00:12:25,675
at the enterprise scale.

194
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,470
Nowadays, AI has become a
part of life for many of us.

195
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,630
Building a prototype using
AI is quick and easy.

196
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:37,900
However, building a sophisticated AI
system to work for us at an enterprise

197
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,210
scale doesn't come in a most magical way.

198
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,050
Implementing gene AI in
enterprise healthcare environments

199
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,310
comes with its own hurdles.

200
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,840
Number one, the fragmented data
silos stakeholders use multiple

201
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,070
legacy systems, which has complete
interoperability between the systems.

202
00:12:54,415 --> 00:12:56,905
Making it hard for the data
to interact with each other.

203
00:12:57,205 --> 00:12:58,705
That's breaking the data pipeline.

204
00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:01,765
We have to overcome these
challenges case by cases.

205
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:05,635
For example, building a custom connector
to resolve the issue in this case.

206
00:13:06,415 --> 00:13:10,255
Number two is a model explainability
healthcare decisions, demand

207
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:12,235
transparency, for example.

208
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:16,555
Everyone is interested in knowing
why a claim was denied as opposed

209
00:13:16,555 --> 00:13:19,405
to if the claim was approved or
denied or flagged for review.

210
00:13:20,185 --> 00:13:21,865
Number three is a cultural readiness.

211
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:26,860
We have made AI capable enough to
build complex workflows, and it's super

212
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,900
critical for our human teams to have
data and AI literacy to seamlessly

213
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,220
navigate the intelligent pipelines
built by these AI applications, and also

214
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,200
interpret the AI argumented outputs.

215
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,030
Overcoming these challenges mainly
requires strong data governance,

216
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,920
standard interfaces, and human oversight
built into these AI enabled workflows.

217
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,650
Compliance and privacy.

218
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,330
Compliance is not an afterthought in any
industry when it comes to healthcare.

219
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:59,100
It's even more essential and critical
than it has to be embedded by design.

220
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:04,200
When using gene ai, we need to ensure that
the AI outcomes has a following trait.

221
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,660
Number one, explainable ai.

222
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:10,365
Where every decision should
be traced and explained.

223
00:14:10,845 --> 00:14:12,585
And number two is a federated learning.

224
00:14:13,275 --> 00:14:17,055
Here models train across institutions
without sharing raw data,

225
00:14:17,445 --> 00:14:19,275
thereby preserving the privacy.

226
00:14:19,695 --> 00:14:23,055
And number three is the bias
mitigation, continuous monitoring

227
00:14:23,055 --> 00:14:27,375
for demographic fairness, leaving no
room even for the unconscious bias.

228
00:14:27,765 --> 00:14:30,285
And number four is a regulatory alignment.

229
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:35,490
Here full adherence to the industry
regulations like HIPAA for us, GDPR, for

230
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,500
Europe, and emerging AI ethics framework.

231
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:43,140
These principles will make the system
both responsible and trustworthy, thus

232
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,090
still holding the humans accountable.

233
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,120
Let's look at the future
of healthcare claims.

234
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:53,250
Gen AI is reshaping the healthcare
industry at a larger scale in terms of

235
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,425
intelligence, efficiency, and performance.

236
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:02,130
Looking ahead, we could leverage AI to
have increasingly massive positive impact

237
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,370
with the revolutionary processing speed.

238
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:09,710
The end-to-end claim cycles could be
reduced from weeks to hours and minutes,

239
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,240
and it also supports a substantial
cost reduction by automating cuts

240
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,315
manual review and re rework there
by reducing the cost significantly.

241
00:15:18,815 --> 00:15:22,235
And finally, the unraveled fraud
detection self-learning models

242
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:25,355
that evolve with threats to handle
them effectively and securely.

243
00:15:25,855 --> 00:15:30,895
To conclude, we are witnessing how
GNI enables s smarter, safer, and more

244
00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:33,205
transparent healthcare payment ecosystem.

245
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:37,585
By improving trust between providers,
payers, and patients, all alike

246
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:42,025
organization must proactively address
the pressing challenges to ensure

247
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:45,925
safe and responsible deployment
of gene AI at an enterprise scale.

248
00:15:46,615 --> 00:15:51,145
With that gene AI can revolutionize
healthcare claims, but combining data

249
00:15:51,145 --> 00:15:55,855
intelligence, automation and fraud
analytics, all under one explainable

250
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:59,815
and compliant framework, that
brings us to our end of our session.

251
00:16:00,205 --> 00:16:03,085
Thank you all for your time and interest
in listening to today's session.

252
00:16:03,475 --> 00:16:06,895
I hope you got a better understanding
about the role of Genea and what

253
00:16:06,895 --> 00:16:09,985
it holds in the future of claims
processing in the healthcare industry.

254
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:13,345
You all have a good day, have
a great learning, and cheers.
