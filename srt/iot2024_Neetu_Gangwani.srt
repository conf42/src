1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:02,020
My name is Neetu Gangwani.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:06,849
Today I'm going to discuss about
enhancing IoT security and privacy

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:12,069
in cloud environments using
blockchain federated learning for

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,100
cross cloud trust and compliances.

5
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:16,119
So let's get started.

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:21,120
In today's world, when we talk about the
technologies and software industries,

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,040
everything is dependent on data, whether
you deal with investment banking,

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,389
healthcare, or inventory management
systems, or ERPs, or anything else.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,329
So when we talk about the data,
by default, something comes

10
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:36,110
into our mind, that's the risk.

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,730
Whether our data is secure or
not, is it okay to share the data?

12
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,580
Or what are the challenges when we
talk about the privacy and security,

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,250
especially when we are dealing
with a distributed AI system.

14
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:53,260
So to how we can overcome it,
how we can enhance the security.

15
00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:57,739
So let's first discuss the
problem challenges in privacy

16
00:00:57,739 --> 00:00:59,430
and security in distributed AI.

17
00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:03,790
First of all, data sensitivity,
distributed data sets often contain

18
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:09,380
sensitive personal and organizational
data that cannot be shared or centralized.

19
00:01:09,949 --> 00:01:14,069
We can't share our personal data
with anywhere like we don't want to

20
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:16,849
share it and other security threats.

21
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:23,280
AI systems are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks like model poisoning and Sybil

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,360
attacks compromising system integrity.

23
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,190
Trust defects, collaboration across
organization or cloud providers, lack

24
00:01:31,199 --> 00:01:36,820
of transparency leading to mistrust in
the AI outputs, regulatory pressures,

25
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,319
stricter data protections law, such
as JDPR, HIPAA, require systems to

26
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,789
ensure privacy and accountability.

27
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:46,580
So what are the solutions?

28
00:01:46,589 --> 00:01:47,729
So there are other solutions.

29
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:49,830
We can use a different methodology.

30
00:01:50,454 --> 00:01:55,514
To combine all these things to make the
system more reliable, secure and private.

31
00:01:56,195 --> 00:01:59,975
So first one is a blockchain,
a decentralized leisure,

32
00:02:00,014 --> 00:02:04,565
provide transparency, trust and
immutable for AI model updates.

33
00:02:05,014 --> 00:02:09,305
Another one is federated learning
and enable collaborative model

34
00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:12,855
training without sharing raw
data, maintaining data privacy.

35
00:02:13,394 --> 00:02:18,005
Cloud AI combines the scalability
and efficiency of cloud platform with

36
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,034
privacy and preserving mechanism.

37
00:02:20,825 --> 00:02:24,825
let's just see each and
every terminology in detail.

38
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:26,875
So first one is a blockchain.

39
00:02:26,895 --> 00:02:28,935
What exactly meaning of the blockchain?

40
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:32,995
So blockchain is basically a
decentralized distributed ledger

41
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:37,975
technology that ensure transparency,
immutability, security of the transition.

42
00:02:38,715 --> 00:02:45,445
So it uses the cryptographic technologies
and to create a chain of blocks Each

43
00:02:45,445 --> 00:02:48,605
contains a set of transaction key feature.

44
00:02:48,655 --> 00:02:53,175
Key features include decentralization
with no single entity has

45
00:02:53,175 --> 00:02:54,875
control over the entire network.

46
00:02:55,385 --> 00:03:00,025
Transparency as all transactions are
visible to the network participants

47
00:03:00,084 --> 00:03:05,704
and immutable, making it extremely
difficult to alert recorded data.

48
00:03:05,705 --> 00:03:08,535
So in blockchain, what exactly happens?

49
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:13,655
For example, user is sending one
sentence and then over the network it

50
00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:18,065
will block, it will create the, it will
break the sentence into the different

51
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:22,565
blocks and each block will be combined
after receiving by the participant.

52
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:29,795
And these blocks, have the private keys
and the, and they are getting transferred

53
00:03:29,805 --> 00:03:33,265
by using the different networks.

54
00:03:33,765 --> 00:03:35,565
Next, what is the federated learning?

55
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:40,105
Federated learning is a machine
learning paradigm that was built by

56
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:44,705
Google in 2017 that enables training
models to be distributed dataset

57
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:46,485
without centralizing the data.

58
00:03:47,055 --> 00:03:51,064
In federated learning, multiple
parties collaborate to train AI

59
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:55,165
shared models while keeping their
data locally, addressing privacy

60
00:03:55,165 --> 00:03:57,585
concerns, regulatory requirements, etc.

61
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,600
The process typically involves central
server coordinating the learning

62
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:08,189
process, where local models are trained
on individual datasets and only model

63
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,069
updates are shared with the server.

64
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,890
The server then aggregates these updates
to improve the global model, which

65
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,820
is redistributed to the party server.

66
00:04:19,205 --> 00:04:21,695
participants for the
next round of training.

67
00:04:22,365 --> 00:04:23,495
Next, Cloud AI.

68
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:28,985
Cloud AI refers to artificial intelligence
service and infrastructure provided

69
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:30,975
through cloud computing platform.

70
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:38,060
It encompasses A wide range of offering
from pre trained models and API to fully

71
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,980
managed machine learning platforms.

72
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,150
The current landscape is dominated by
major cloud providers offering scalable

73
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:52,050
AI solution, enabling our organization
to leverage advanced AI capabilities

74
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,630
without significant upfront investment
in the hardware and the expertise.

75
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,600
So what are the key components?

76
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:04,090
Blockchain, when we combine these two
technology into the framework, we are

77
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,590
getting the multiple and advantages
like decentralized model updates.

78
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:14,490
Each update is treated as a transaction
enhancing transparency traceability.

79
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,049
So when we record each and every
transaction, who has performed it,

80
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:24,070
how performed, and these transactions
should be immutable so that user

81
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,020
don't have the rights to remove
it, updated or do any modification.

82
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,460
In the logs, so that's the beauty
of the system moving to the next

83
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,630
one smart contracts Automates
validations and consequences for

84
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,210
model updates, ensuring integrity.

85
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:47,550
If something is updated at the one place,
the system has to make sure all the copies

86
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:52,660
are updated with the correct data and
none of the copies have the older data.

87
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,679
Incentive mechanisms reward
high quality data contribution

88
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,690
and prevent system gaming.

89
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:05,650
Access control cryptographic identity
management ensures only authorized.

90
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,430
Participants contribute.

91
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,900
For example, when you are dealing
with the mobile at that time, either

92
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,690
you use your mobile passcode or
your fingerprints or your face ID.

93
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:21,549
So these type of, Authentications are
known as the cryptographic identity,

94
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:27,759
then audit rail, immutable record of
all the interactions for accountability

95
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,549
and the compliances, benefits,
advantage of integrated approach,

96
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:39,034
enhanced Privacy keeps data localized
while securely sharing model updates.

97
00:06:39,394 --> 00:06:44,194
So whatever the base model you have,
that will be kept on your on prem servers

98
00:06:44,234 --> 00:06:48,434
or the centralized servers without
having the connection with the internet.

99
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:53,774
Improved trust, immutable records,
build confidence in collaborative AI.

100
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:59,284
cross cloud interoperability, enables
seamless use of diverse cloud AI

101
00:06:59,284 --> 00:07:05,284
service, resistance to attack, combines
block check consequences and federated

102
00:07:05,304 --> 00:07:10,114
learning, decentralization for robust
security, regulatory compliances,

103
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:16,774
providing transparency, audit drills to
simplify JDPR and the HIPAA compliance,

104
00:07:17,444 --> 00:07:19,894
potential applications, so there are many.

105
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:24,779
Many applications where we can
enhance the privacy and security using

106
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:26,899
blockchain enabled federated learning.

107
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:31,229
For example, healthcare collaborates
securely on patient data for drug

108
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,529
discovery and personalized treatment.

109
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:40,029
Finance trained fraud detection
models across institutions without

110
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:42,484
exposing sensitive transaction data.

111
00:07:42,864 --> 00:07:47,234
Smart cities optimize urban
planning and resource management

112
00:07:47,244 --> 00:07:49,714
with privacy preserving AI models.

113
00:07:50,164 --> 00:07:54,804
Supply chain improves forecasting
and inventory management without

114
00:07:54,814 --> 00:07:56,534
compromising business data.

115
00:07:57,284 --> 00:07:59,044
Age computing enabling AI.

116
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:05,479
Enable iot devices to collaboratively
train AI model keeping data secure

117
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:10,539
and localized Comparative advantages
why this approach is stand out.

118
00:08:10,549 --> 00:08:16,059
So first of all is a privacy preservation
Techniques like differential privacy

119
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:20,519
and homo Homomorphic encryption
prevents sensitive data exposure.

120
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:25,569
Select scalability layer 2 blockchain

122
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:32,869
Regulatory alignment designed
to comply with JDPR, HIPAA

123
00:08:32,869 --> 00:08:34,589
and other global regulations.

124
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:38,394
Collaboration innovation
incentive structure encourage

125
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:42,959
multiple party participation
while preventing manipulations.

126
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,689
Challenges and future direction.

127
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:48,749
Addressing challenges and
unlocking opportunities.

128
00:08:49,219 --> 00:08:50,209
Scalability.

129
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:56,219
Research efficient algorithms like
sharding to handle high volume

130
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:59,359

Governance, exploring DAOs for
decentralized model and version control.

138
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:32,389
Let's see a case study.

139
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:36,959
For example, healthcare use care
secure federated learning problem

140
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,769
