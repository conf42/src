00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,460
Hey everyone, this is Dlip Kumar
and I'm thrilled to be here today.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,030
I'm currently working as advanced
cloud engineering professional with

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,360
over 19 years of experience in the
information technology industry.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,980
Over the past several years, I have
been deeply engaged in initiatives

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,060
that leverage artificial intelligence
and machine learning to solve critical

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,410
business challenges, and particularly
within the financial services domain.

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:31,460
My experience with Swift integration
onto Azure has provided unique insights

8
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,570
into how machine learning can enhance
fraud detection and risk management

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,950
In payment processing, I have actively
explored how to apply machine learning

10
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:45,590
models to improve security and efficiency
of financial transactions, optimized

11
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,375
resource allocation, and improve
predictive modeling for customer support.

12
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:53,435
Today we are here to explore how
we ensure these models can operate

13
00:00:53,735 --> 00:00:55,235
effectively in the real time world.

14
00:00:55,985 --> 00:01:00,455
I will demonstrate how ML Ops can
help scale the models for financial

15
00:01:00,455 --> 00:01:04,265
systems and walk through the key
components of successful ML ops

16
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:06,425
strategy for financial institutions.

17
00:01:07,145 --> 00:01:10,475
So we'll try to explore on
understanding the problems and

18
00:01:10,475 --> 00:01:14,134
identify effective solutions that
is crucial for achieving success.

19
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:17,164
Ultimately, our goal is
to ensure success in that.

20
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:21,110
Financial industry so that fewer
individuals suffer from fraud.

21
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:26,480
We'll provide guidance on how to
implement the steps needed for AI models

22
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,560
to be reliable and capable of scaling
effectively with the financial sector.

23
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:35,690
Through this mops, principles can step
in, techniques, can help in creating

24
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,030
robust and highly effective ML pipelines.

25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,620
Okay, so how the current state of
ml in financial services looks like.

26
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:49,585
So financial institutions have
increasingly realized that the machine

27
00:01:49,585 --> 00:01:55,115
learning isn't just a passing trend,
it's truly changes the landscape, right?

28
00:01:55,625 --> 00:02:02,035
So they are increasingly relying on ML
for the first application is a real world.

29
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:06,115
You, if you can consider that as a
realtime fraud detection, allowing us

30
00:02:06,115 --> 00:02:09,385
to picture the potential prevention
of a fraudulent transaction.

31
00:02:09,805 --> 00:02:13,945
So the models can catch the crime
instantly, avoid the loss for

32
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:15,655
all who are, who all involved.

33
00:02:16,105 --> 00:02:19,285
So this will also contribute
to make an easier financial

34
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:21,505
system for every single one.

35
00:02:22,195 --> 00:02:27,125
So additionally ML can make accurate
credit risk assessments and follow

36
00:02:27,264 --> 00:02:29,064
specific financial regulations.

37
00:02:29,664 --> 00:02:34,414
However lots of organizations
experiencing the complications

38
00:02:34,414 --> 00:02:35,824
in implementing the above.

39
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:37,844
What are all the things that are there?

40
00:02:37,974 --> 00:02:42,624
So usually we will not be able to
experience such kind of complications

41
00:02:42,654 --> 00:02:46,984
when you try to follow the process or
the governance framework around it.

42
00:02:47,564 --> 00:02:51,464
Putting models in place is often
done manually, like imagining a

43
00:02:51,464 --> 00:02:55,964
team, taking a weeks to get set up,
putting systems in place, and also

44
00:02:55,964 --> 00:02:59,414
installing code rather than focusing
on making their models better.

45
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:03,939
So the poor tracking of models
can cause them to shift over

46
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:05,619
time, losing their accuracy.

47
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:09,169
Governance gaps, create
complaints, problems for all

48
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:10,789
of those about things, right?

49
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:15,739
We will discuss how ML Ops has
solved all those issues, right?

50
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,859
So with that, so we can see how ML
Lops transformation opportunity is

51
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:23,109
going to be looking like for us, right?

52
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:26,829
So let's take a look at
what ML Ops really is.

53
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:31,369
So in short, mops are
machine learning operations.

54
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,149
We can say like it's the same
as how you call it as DevOps

55
00:03:35,179 --> 00:03:36,349
development operations, right?

56
00:03:36,929 --> 00:03:41,699
But for ML ops in, as it has a
foster deployment to speed up models.

57
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:46,509
So deployment of systems can occur
with just hours which has never

58
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:50,214
happened before due to the old method
old methodology of implementations.

59
00:03:50,714 --> 00:03:54,794
So now lops can create an environmental
of enhancement, reliability,

60
00:03:54,794 --> 00:03:56,774
therefore preventing of any issues.

61
00:03:57,254 --> 00:04:01,334
So good collaboration with other
engineers is very important,

62
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:03,284
and lops can provide just that.

63
00:04:03,404 --> 00:04:07,774
So in addition to the various
other great points the one thing

64
00:04:07,774 --> 00:04:12,074
to highlight is the ML ops enhances
regularity, adherence, right?

65
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:17,174
So all of these things that ML Lops
provide can help create a strong

66
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:20,174
foundation for the AI models to develop.

67
00:04:20,684 --> 00:04:24,014
So with these concepts and
more, an organization can scale

68
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:27,764
with agile management and be
set up for a very nice system.

69
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:34,004
So to help out all these kind of
implementation of ml. So with these

70
00:04:34,004 --> 00:04:37,784
things like you can really achieve
what we are actually looking for.

71
00:04:38,264 --> 00:04:42,654
So the core, core components of
financial ML lops think of these core

72
00:04:42,654 --> 00:04:46,514
parts at the blueprint for building
a successful ML lops framework.

73
00:04:47,024 --> 00:04:52,004
So they are the main building blocks that
connect to make a great and robust system.

74
00:04:52,454 --> 00:04:54,974
So infrastructure automation
is the key point here.

75
00:04:55,024 --> 00:05:00,124
These are the clouds to manage resources
and set up with infrastructure as a code.

76
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:02,914
So the whole system must
be defined as a code.

77
00:05:03,274 --> 00:05:06,724
So ci cd pipeline automate the
process of building models.

78
00:05:07,654 --> 00:05:12,094
Testing and deployment, all the actions
can be quickly done and automated.

79
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:16,174
Monitoring and alerting is the
place where everything is checked.

80
00:05:16,624 --> 00:05:20,414
Always check if something is wrong or
not which is always a good thing, right?

81
00:05:20,414 --> 00:05:23,594
Like whenever something is wrong,
like you immediately alert it.

82
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:29,014
So since that can cause if you handle
the alert well, it can significantly

83
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:30,219
avoid any issues to happen.

84
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:34,309
Governance framework makes sure
everything goes as per the plan.

85
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:37,569
In a regular regulatory
compliance point of view, right?

86
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,269
It's important to take
a note in governance.

87
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:45,679
So these are all the, these are
all for major for implementing

88
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,359
a financial ML strategy.

89
00:05:47,859 --> 00:05:50,884
So infrastructure as a code
for ML neuro environment.

90
00:05:51,594 --> 00:05:56,004
So it is extremely important to understand
how necessary infrastructure as a code

91
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,654
is in the financial sector, right?

92
00:05:58,014 --> 00:06:03,384
So where regulations and safety and
security are very much important in

93
00:06:03,384 --> 00:06:06,234
this financial institutions especially.

94
00:06:06,244 --> 00:06:11,944
So if you, if there is no security,
there is so much of fraud to be

95
00:06:11,944 --> 00:06:13,624
prone in those systems to be.

96
00:06:14,134 --> 00:06:15,754
So that's why like you have.

97
00:06:16,254 --> 00:06:20,304
We should really be focusing on isolated
development environment so that there are

98
00:06:20,304 --> 00:06:22,404
no problems with current or new projects.

99
00:06:23,184 --> 00:06:28,064
It's extremely important to test every
single step and also the complete

100
00:06:28,064 --> 00:06:29,954
project you have to review thoroughly.

101
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:33,704
So there must be some sort of
production infrastructure so that

102
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:35,834
deployment is safe and secure.

103
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:39,284
So with the systems like
Terraform, it makes setting up

104
00:06:39,284 --> 00:06:40,934
and running the systems easy.

105
00:06:41,084 --> 00:06:44,319
You can also set your own security
in place with these systems.

106
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:49,999
So how CI ICD pipelines for
model deployment it's going

107
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:51,289
to be look like, right?

108
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:56,059
So the ci cd pipelines are like an
assembly line for artificial intelligence.

109
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:59,719
So this means every step can
move smoothly without breaking.

110
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:05,989
So CI I CD will help automate systems
with the steps like automated testing

111
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:07,819
and checking for a deployment.

112
00:07:08,224 --> 00:07:10,384
And how the post
validations are happening.

113
00:07:10,384 --> 00:07:14,164
Is there any pre-steps that needs to
be implemented before the deployment?

114
00:07:14,164 --> 00:07:17,374
And all these things can come
into, continuous integration and

115
00:07:17,374 --> 00:07:18,934
continuous deployment lifecycle.

116
00:07:19,384 --> 00:07:24,034
So you can test as many as
areas using automated testing.

117
00:07:24,034 --> 00:07:29,494
This makes it more accessible to detect
fraud and bad actors, especially, right?

118
00:07:29,994 --> 00:07:32,189
So this way you can easily handle CIC.

119
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:37,114
When it comes to advanced monitoring
for financial ML models, so data

120
00:07:37,114 --> 00:07:40,634
accuracy must be present for
the models will lose the edge.

121
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:44,354
So the way to solve this is
having a constant lance and

122
00:07:44,354 --> 00:07:46,184
monitoring the data all the time.

123
00:07:46,694 --> 00:07:50,404
So another thing is model metrics
needs to be tested constant,

124
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:52,504
constantly as well, right?

125
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:56,104
So this involves running through
different steps and setting

126
00:07:56,134 --> 00:07:57,469
outcomes become the model.

127
00:07:57,969 --> 00:08:02,639
So this constant cycle makes the
model accurate and ready to be

128
00:08:02,739 --> 00:08:04,999
useful for the users to test it out.

129
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:08,749
So the last thing to do important
can start tracking to make sure

130
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:10,759
the data does not shift and change.

131
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:15,039
So this can be solved through
checking feature importance.

132
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,399
All of these helps improve
a model performance.

133
00:08:19,344 --> 00:08:24,864
So how automated model model retaining
workflows that, we can imagine in this

134
00:08:24,864 --> 00:08:29,274
particular scenario, like you have to
make sure the models don't lose relevance.

135
00:08:29,694 --> 00:08:34,104
So keep in mind that the models
have to keep up with every change

136
00:08:34,104 --> 00:08:36,474
that is out there to prevent this.

137
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:40,644
Automate models are there to help
out with every situation, key

138
00:08:40,644 --> 00:08:44,094
components or drift detection to
see if the data changes, right?

139
00:08:44,664 --> 00:08:47,094
So if the situation is a change in data.

140
00:08:47,634 --> 00:08:50,544
Then next steps is to update
through the training pipeline.

141
00:08:50,634 --> 00:08:54,714
After this is done, then everything is
done and the model should be ready for

142
00:08:54,714 --> 00:08:57,354
you to use for a real world scenario.

143
00:08:57,544 --> 00:09:01,204
Any example, all of this happens
through an automated components.

144
00:09:01,204 --> 00:09:05,774
With all of this in mind, leading
firms can de, deploy models into just

145
00:09:05,774 --> 00:09:12,374
hours versus it becoming take days
and deployment like so everything

146
00:09:12,374 --> 00:09:16,364
comes down to a needing a quick
setup because all these settings

147
00:09:16,364 --> 00:09:18,284
can be very difficult and slow.

148
00:09:18,784 --> 00:09:23,614
So how ML governance and compliance can
be implemented for compliance models have

149
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:25,564
to go through the same rigorous steps.

150
00:09:25,684 --> 00:09:25,939
The step.

151
00:09:26,374 --> 00:09:30,424
The first step is to take when setting
up governance is the documentation you

152
00:09:30,424 --> 00:09:34,684
need to document, model data, and steps
to make sure nothing bad will happen.

153
00:09:34,984 --> 00:09:39,724
With all those in mind, you can follow
and automate systems when that occurs.

154
00:09:39,814 --> 00:09:43,029
Compliance with government can
also occur in just more natural.

155
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:48,989
So cloud platform and implementation
patterns we can discuss, like to create a

156
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:54,239
model that cloud is very much, IM a factor
nowadays because everything is, cloud

157
00:09:54,239 --> 00:10:01,199
version of data being a Azure platform or
Google cloud platform or AWS like whatnot.

158
00:10:01,204 --> 00:10:06,069
Like you can consider any cloud, but
it lets you, create your own artificial

159
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:10,419
in inte platform and have what it
needs to be successful platforms

160
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:12,334
can do what they do best, right?

161
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:15,969
However, you must consider all
situations before making a choice.

162
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:20,039
All in all, it comes down to your
needs and situations to do customizing

163
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:23,709
systems to make them unique and
in sync with important great

164
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:25,509
artificial intelligence solutions.

165
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:30,289
So how real time inter like
scaling for financial systems.

166
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:34,479
So in the space of financial systems
like every second matters, as one

167
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:38,469
of the things that everyone expects
are 24 7 availability and zero

168
00:10:38,469 --> 00:10:40,149
downtime for situations of fraud.

169
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:44,259
If one second there is a fraud
attack, there should be always

170
00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:47,864
be severe, ready to deal with
these kind of issues immediately.

171
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:53,029
One of the strategies to do this is to
have servers that automatically adjust.

172
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:57,119
So that allows them to handle
any type of, volatility, right?

173
00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:00,639
So you have to be ready
for any type situation.

174
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:03,689
AB testing frameworks
for model validation.

175
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:06,034
How you can do it before
every launch, right?

176
00:11:06,034 --> 00:11:08,644
Like you always wanted
to test if it'll work.

177
00:11:09,184 --> 00:11:11,879
The method you can implement
is using AB testing.

178
00:11:12,724 --> 00:11:16,684
Ab, it makes sure that
each change goes smoothly.

179
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:21,424
You also need to make sure that they are
not destructive and that they are very

180
00:11:21,424 --> 00:11:25,404
much safer to do and when it comes to
automated bias detection and mitigation

181
00:11:25,404 --> 00:11:29,664
like in every system people come from
a different background, ages, and more.

182
00:11:29,664 --> 00:11:31,944
You cannot discriminate
against anyone, right?

183
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,469
So it should be fair for in every AI
step that you are gonna implement.

184
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:39,169
So implement the right
process that we'll catch.

185
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:43,609
If AI is not what as expected,
so cross-functional ML ops team

186
00:11:43,609 --> 00:11:45,349
structure, how it's going to be.

187
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:48,659
So for artificial intelligence
relative, you need to a solid

188
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,909
team in order to prevent this.

189
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:52,839
Everyone should work together.

190
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:57,669
So there should not be any team that,
that say we don't, we do not connect.

191
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:01,659
So we have to be very
very manageable at times.

192
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:05,589
Like with all the cross-functional ML
ops team structures, everything has to

193
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:10,499
connect seamlessly so everyone can work
their best and give the best results.

194
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:13,579
So key and next steps.

195
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:16,859
In summary, there is a lot a lot
that goes into the system, right?

196
00:12:16,859 --> 00:12:20,639
As you all know, like you have to
monitor, automate, and be secure.

197
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,319
Everything has to work together.

198
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:27,299
But the highest chance of success, if you
are starting up, one of the main things

199
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:29,579
you should do is measure the situations.

200
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:33,209
To do this, you should measure
what is there, like what needs to

201
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:35,459
improvement, and then you are set to go.

202
00:12:36,294 --> 00:12:39,054
These are all the main
components that we can consider.

203
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:44,074
This is what I can, I know I can
provide with my best experience.

204
00:12:44,124 --> 00:12:48,529
So with all the information that I
have had by working with closely with,

205
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:50,629
many teams, many people in the past.

206
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:56,269
So it might be a useful session
for you folks, like hopefully it's

207
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:58,309
giving you good enough content.

208
00:12:58,699 --> 00:12:59,209
Thank you all.
