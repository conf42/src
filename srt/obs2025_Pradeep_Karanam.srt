1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,880
Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:07,779
I'm PK, and today we'll explore
how an event driven observability

3
00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:14,710
layer can finally light up the blind
spots between ECA and the MA teams.

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,620
Think of this session as
journey from today's file.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:25,404
Drop headaches to your future where
design changes surface in real time.

6
00:00:25,904 --> 00:00:26,324
Before.

7
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:31,414
They burn either schedule
or budget or both.

8
00:00:31,914 --> 00:00:32,514
Here is map.

9
00:00:33,014 --> 00:00:34,784
We'll begin with collaboration gap.

10
00:00:35,284 --> 00:00:38,764
Why late found issues are still the norm?

11
00:00:39,264 --> 00:00:43,794
Then we'll find defined
that event driven vision.

12
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:50,079
We'll unpack three core building
blocks named Schema audit.

13
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:58,459
And library sync and two cross cutting
enablers, taxonomy and resilience.

14
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:02,919
A quick architecture walkthrough
shows how it all fits.

15
00:01:03,419 --> 00:01:07,679
We look at pilot projects,
technical and business KPIs.

16
00:01:08,179 --> 00:01:12,169
Finally, we'll touch
on monitoring roadmap.

17
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:17,084
By the end, you will see
exactly where to start.

18
00:01:17,764 --> 00:01:19,504
Your own tool chain.

19
00:01:20,004 --> 00:01:23,054
Let's ground the problem even in 2025.

20
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:31,334
Most hardware programs pass files
between ECA and MA at a gated milestones.

21
00:01:31,834 --> 00:01:37,654
A study across eight boards
found over 10 snapshots per spin.

22
00:01:38,154 --> 00:01:41,634
Each snapshot a potential rerouting.

23
00:01:42,134 --> 00:01:48,164
Industry data shows that late
reworking inflates cost eight to 10%

24
00:01:48,644 --> 00:01:52,364
and drag schedules four to six weeks.

25
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:59,904
People end up in detective mode, which
file version, which variant who change

26
00:01:59,904 --> 00:02:02,959
the key part when that fog sets in.

27
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:05,109
Design energy shifts from.

28
00:02:05,904 --> 00:02:07,944
Innovation to forensic triage.

29
00:02:08,444 --> 00:02:10,364
That's the gap we must close.

30
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,004
Hope you all agree with me.

31
00:02:12,504 --> 00:02:14,964
Here's a story you'll recognize.

32
00:02:15,464 --> 00:02:20,894
Mid program mechanical changes at
chais rib by three millimeters.

33
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,994
Yeah, it's just three millimeters.

34
00:02:23,494 --> 00:02:24,174
Keyboard strengths.

35
00:02:24,674 --> 00:02:28,244
But ECA keeps routing blissfully unaware.

36
00:02:28,744 --> 00:02:37,694
A week later, the ya screams and suddenly
you are starting at a 250 K wrist

37
00:02:37,694 --> 00:02:41,924
pin and a six week slip as a sample.

38
00:02:41,924 --> 00:02:45,634
Numbers root cause isnt bad tools.

39
00:02:46,354 --> 00:02:49,444
It's timing of information, isn't it?

40
00:02:49,944 --> 00:02:53,844
The insight actually
arrived too late to matter.

41
00:02:54,344 --> 00:03:00,334
So why events first, they are push-based.

42
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:02,665
A tool emits a lightweight message.

43
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:05,900
The instance something meaningful happens.

44
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,070
Second events or context reach.

45
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:14,869
Bundle geometry, hashes,
user IDs, variant tax.

46
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:23,339
Third context leads downstreams check
file automatically, and third even flows

47
00:03:23,339 --> 00:03:25,619
through a broker that is resilient.

48
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:31,380
If M card is done, ECA can
keep publishing the system.

49
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:32,219
Replace.

50
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:35,149
Once MCA is back, the bottom line is.

51
00:03:35,944 --> 00:03:37,654
Decision that used to wait.

52
00:03:37,654 --> 00:03:40,294
This now happens in minutes.

53
00:03:40,794 --> 00:03:44,394
Our first billing block
is a shared schema.

54
00:03:44,894 --> 00:03:53,095
Every ECA change or MCA update
follows the same contract item id,

55
00:03:53,845 --> 00:03:57,305
revision id, geometry, hash user.

56
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:58,345
Timestamp.

57
00:03:58,845 --> 00:04:00,585
Optional blocks.

58
00:04:00,585 --> 00:04:05,055
Capture CC variance for bomb options.

59
00:04:05,555 --> 00:04:05,975
Tools.

60
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:10,705
Validate locally mal informed
events, never leave the workstation.

61
00:04:11,205 --> 00:04:20,810
Consistent structure is what lets hundreds
of tools speak one language without.

62
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:22,145
Back at the code

63
00:04:22,645 --> 00:04:29,595
Second, audit, logging every event
also lands in an immutable store.

64
00:04:30,195 --> 00:04:35,560
We track general workflow,
security, file access logs.

65
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,890
Who changed what and when These logs.

66
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:48,675
Cut your cost time from hours,
two minutes and satisfy the

67
00:04:48,675 --> 00:04:54,495
traceability mandate in medical
and automation automotive hardware.

68
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:59,765
They are exportable to CSV
for compliance reviews.

69
00:05:00,305 --> 00:05:05,145
No more screenshot archeology,
and it's library sync.

70
00:05:05,645 --> 00:05:07,625
Third library synchronization.

71
00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:18,175
Using ECA ed Library xml, we run
export library, sync Library, and multi

72
00:05:18,175 --> 00:05:25,595
revision check-ins that keeps symbols
and footprints aligned across tools like

73
00:05:25,655 --> 00:05:30,005
OrCAD, Allegro, and nx, where they live.

74
00:05:30,505 --> 00:05:35,425
The status file success
flag becomes another event.

75
00:05:35,725 --> 00:05:43,795
So analytics can spot its tail footprint
before it sneaks into schematic.

76
00:05:44,295 --> 00:05:50,885
Now we layer two crosscut enablers,
geometry events, board outline,

77
00:05:51,815 --> 00:05:54,245
key ports, mounting holes.

78
00:05:54,745 --> 00:06:04,185
Component events like placement moves,
part swaps analysis, events like DFM or

79
00:06:04,685 --> 00:06:07,340
thermal rule results during the projects.

80
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:15,990
Lightweight heuristics, nothing exotic,
mostly DUM, and the bonds cut irrelevant.

81
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,550
Charter by 54%.

82
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,370
That means engineers only see
the signal, not the noise.

83
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:28,570
Of course, events are great
until something starts so we

84
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,015
embed back pressure and replay.

85
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:37,890
If MCAT goes offline, the broker
queues safely and replace on recovery.

86
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:46,640
Compensating transactions, rollback
partial rights, A checksum, verifier

87
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:53,440
blocks, corrupt payloads, and a
circuit breaker isolate flaky.

88
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,790
PLM APIs.

89
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:00,770
The net result observability
you can actually trust at scale.

90
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:09,710
Putting it together, ECA and MA, published
into a Kafka broker stream processor,

91
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:17,695
compare events, geometry, deltas, and
bomb differences kind of violation.

92
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:20,635
Go to dashboard and chat channels.

93
00:07:21,135 --> 00:07:25,755
The audit store captures
everything for legal traceability.

94
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:28,385
This isn't a science project.

95
00:07:29,105 --> 00:07:32,135
These components are all off the shelf

96
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:33,025
here.

97
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:38,155
How a key out violation plays out.

98
00:07:38,655 --> 00:07:42,945
MA publishes an m, a update, rib added.

99
00:07:43,445 --> 00:07:49,845
Stream processor compares
geometry hash key out strike rule.

100
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,747
Engine flax, out of bound ECA and mca.

101
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:59,710
Both get a slapping with a 3D overlay
minute er, the change not base.

102
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:05,370
Yes, that's the magic instant
context rich feedback.

103
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,469
Let's look at the numbers
from pilot board changes.

104
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:14,409
Revision lead time dropped
from seven days to three days.

105
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:21,950
Second example, part number approvals
from four down to a day and half, and

106
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,890
board spins fell from three to two.

107
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,900
Those are scheduled wins.

108
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:28,939
Your CFO can bank

109
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,419
on the business side.

110
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:35,169
Time to decision, snapshot
count and conflict resolution

111
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,449
all improve by 60 plus percent.

112
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:42,959
Less churn means fewer
Friday night scrambles.

113
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:48,760
Lower expense and happier
engineers finally, which were

114
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,550
HR metrics will confirm, right?

115
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,629
Observability can't be blind to itself.

116
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:59,389
Grafana tracks events,
volume and broker lag.

117
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:02,739
Active workspace shows 3D Deltas.

118
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:09,984
Kibana lets you grab every payload
server, monitor config watches for DB

119
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:17,929
connection losses and deadlocks ping
ops only when threshold or breached.

120
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:23,449
That's how we keep the pipeline
healthy long after launch day.

121
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:25,659
Roll out in four phases.

122
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:32,709
Phase one, capture bomb outline
events, low noise, instant value.

123
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:36,659
Phase two, add constraints
and variant events.

124
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:41,519
Phase three, inline
DFM, and thermal checks.

125
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:44,339
Phase four feed.

126
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:49,679
Suppliers and manufacturing
within the same streams.

127
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,199
Each phase is incremental.

128
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:55,789
You harvest our ROI return investment.

129
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:57,409
Before moving on.

130
00:09:57,909 --> 00:10:02,069
If your scars to save you,
your paying, start small.

131
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:04,259
Too many events too soon.

132
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:05,699
Erodes trust.

133
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:08,359
Govern schema versions.

134
00:10:09,349 --> 00:10:09,679
Yep.

135
00:10:09,979 --> 00:10:10,879
Nothing breaks.

136
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:15,259
Integration faster than
silent field changes.

137
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:20,859
Align ECA and MCA naming
conventions on day one.

138
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:28,229
Invest early in broker observability like
lag metrics or your early warning radar.

139
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:29,239
Thank you.

140
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:34,039
That's the journey from blind
Spots to real time clarity.

141
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:36,454
Thanks for writing up the room with me.

142
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:38,935
Have a wonderful rest of the day.
