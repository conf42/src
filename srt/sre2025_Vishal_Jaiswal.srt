00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,485
needs and technology solution effectively.

15
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:53,865
Where it is enhancing solutions,
enabling predictive analysis, or

16
00:00:53,865 --> 00:00:55,845
supporting population health management.

17
00:00:56,325 --> 00:00:59,865
I'm passionate about transforming
raw data into strategic asset

18
00:01:00,315 --> 00:01:02,085
that drive better outcomes.

19
00:01:02,565 --> 00:01:07,185
So today we are going to discuss about
the building scalable t predictive

20
00:01:07,695 --> 00:01:09,525
analytics, data warehouse and healthcare.

21
00:01:10,665 --> 00:01:13,995
So this is how basically to
improve the care quality while

22
00:01:14,025 --> 00:01:16,245
optimizing resource utilization.

23
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,340
So when we talk about this topic,
let's first discuss that what

24
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,780
exactly it is important and how this
is going to work in this scenario

25
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,850
when we talk about data analysis.

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,860
This article is basically explored
the design and implementation of

27
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,250
predictive analysis in data warehouse
and modern hospital management system.

28
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,550
This also alsos the transformation
of healthcare operations.

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,960
Through sophisticated data management
architecture, focusing on the integration

30
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,530
of real time analytics, machine
learning, and advanced storage solutions.

31
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,940
It also address the critical
challenges in managing the structured

32
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,560
and unstructured medical data,
implementing security framework, and

33
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,470
ensuring scalability while maintaining
performance standard for the critical

34
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,230
healthcare operations in today's world.

35
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:10,304
When we are rapidly evolving healthcare
landscape, hospitals are experiencing

36
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:16,035
an digital transformation driven by
the imperative to optimize operations.

37
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:19,755
Enhanced percent care, quality
and control is collecting cost.

38
00:02:20,415 --> 00:02:25,575
If you talk about recent studies, as you
saw that here we are showing that 30% of

39
00:02:25,575 --> 00:02:31,424
global data, the whole healthcare will
represent 30% of all global data by 2025.

40
00:02:33,434 --> 00:02:42,135
That efficiency gain 37.4% and the care
quality is 42.8% enhancement in patient

41
00:02:42,135 --> 00:02:44,984
outcomes using analyticals platform.

42
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:50,505
So the recent studies indicate the
healthcare organization implementing

43
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:56,475
data-driven decision making framework
have witnessed a significant 37%

44
00:02:56,475 --> 00:02:57,825
improvement in ultrasound efficiency.

45
00:02:59,655 --> 00:03:04,265
The integration of big data analytics
and artificial intelligence in this

46
00:03:04,265 --> 00:03:07,565
healthcare delivery model, with
organizations reporting an average

47
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:14,675
reduction of around administration
overhead and a 28.6% increase in resource

48
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:19,025
utilization efficiency when implementing
a comprehensive data warehouse solutions,

49
00:03:20,795 --> 00:03:25,745
this whole healthcare sector, the
digital transformation has categorized.

50
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,570
A fundamental shift in how
medical institution approach

51
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,340
data management and analysis.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,660
The research indicate that our
healthcare organization leveraging

53
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,210
advanced analytics, have achieved a
remarkable around 45.3% improvement

54
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,970
in predictive accuracy for percent
admission pattern, and around 33%

55
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:52,070
of enhancement in basically resource
allocation efficiency, the implementation

56
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,780
operative analysis in healthcare.

57
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,030
It basically demonstrate substantial
impact on percent care outcomes

58
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,290
and operational efficiency.

59
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,570
According to the recent clinical
studies, hospitals are utilizing advanced

60
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:13,130
analytical platform and they have
reported a 41.6% reduction in preventable

61
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,649
readmissions, and around 38% improvement
in early intervention success rate.

62
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,810
The evaluation of healthcare data
warehousing has been marked by

63
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:28,430
significant technological advancement
and methodological innovations.

64
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,560
So when we talk about that, when the
healthcare institution implementing modern

65
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,480
data warehouse system that experience
around 47% improvement data processing,

66
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:44,840
and 44% enhancement in real time
analytics, the business impact, we can see

67
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,825
the cost reduction resource utilization.

68
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,689
Manufacturer saving and decision
making reduction they all are

69
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:56,589
effectively impact the whole
system of the healthcare industry.

70
00:04:57,309 --> 00:05:02,679
If we just implement a better and
modern way of data warehousing system.

71
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:09,909
The evolution of the healthcare data
warehousing thing is basically marked.

72
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,289
When we release that in the healthcare
institution implementing the modern

73
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:20,590
warehouse architecture, they can basically
experience around 47% improvement in data

74
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:26,320
processing efficiency, and 44% enhancement
in real time analytics capability.

75
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,610
As I told you, by 2025, we
have around 30% of the global

76
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,780
data is all about healthcare.

77
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,210
The adoption of cloud-based solutions has
further accelerated this transformation,

78
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:42,400
and that enable around 35% reduction
in infrastructure cost and 40%

79
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,929
improvement in system scalability.

80
00:05:44,739 --> 00:05:49,960
These advancement have been particularly
impactful in large hospital network, where

81
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,270
integrated data platform have facilitated
around 40% improvement in cross facility

82
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,830
coordination, and around 38% enhancement
in resource sharing efficiency.

83
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:07,134
So implementing a predictive analysis
in healthcare will demonstrate an

84
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:11,094
impact on present care outcomes and
also the operational efficiency.

85
00:06:11,754 --> 00:06:15,264
This is also shown by
all the other studies

86
00:06:17,304 --> 00:06:19,854
when we talk about the
architecture analysis.

87
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:24,474
There are multi-layer architecture
visualization here, analytics, air

88
00:06:24,714 --> 00:06:26,874
processing layer, and data storage layer.

89
00:06:27,894 --> 00:06:32,004
So when we talk about this analysis,
the foundation of effective healthcare D

90
00:06:32,155 --> 00:06:36,264
House architecture is evolved dramatically
within the exponential growth in

91
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:38,034
healthcare data complexity and volume.

92
00:06:39,144 --> 00:06:42,924
In the recent studies indicate that
healthcare Orions are experiencing an

93
00:06:42,984 --> 00:06:49,464
unprecedented search in data generation
with estimate suggesting that the

94
00:06:49,464 --> 00:06:53,034
healthcare generates approximate
30% of the world data volume, as

95
00:06:53,034 --> 00:06:54,714
I discussed, projected to read.

96
00:06:56,124 --> 00:07:00,384
Around 2000 or more than
that, exabytes by 2025.

97
00:07:01,914 --> 00:07:05,664
The emergence of multi-layer
architectural approach has ized

98
00:07:05,784 --> 00:07:07,314
healthcare data management capability.

99
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,830
The research demonstrate that healthcare
institutions implementing modern data

100
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,580
warehouse architecture have achieved
significant improvement in data

101
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,770
processing efficiency with organizations
reporting around 67% reduction in

102
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:25,599
data retrieval latency, and around 80%
improvement in data integration accuracy.

103
00:07:27,934 --> 00:07:32,469
The data injection layer represents
a critical component in modern

104
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:34,809
healthcare data architecture.

105
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,550
Processing and increasing complex
area of data types and sources.

106
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:44,260
When we talk about unstructured
data volume are expanding

107
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,000
is even more rapid race.

108
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,520
You can see the data is
coming in different formats.

109
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,610
Unstructured data more than rapid race.

110
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,860
You can see 60 to 65% per year.

111
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,855
This layer must accommodate
both real-time streaming data.

112
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:02,650
And percent monitoring system and
batch processing of administration

113
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:07,000
record with leading health
constitution reportedly daily injection

114
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,620
volumes exceeding 10 terabytes

115
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,250
hospitals information system.

116
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:17,290
You can see HIS have evolved to
become increasingly sophisticated

117
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,730
with modern platform managing an
average of 8,000 distinct data

118
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,710
points per percent encounter.

119
00:08:25,195 --> 00:08:29,934
The research source that integrated
HIS platform in healthcare setting

120
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:33,595
process across, you can say 1.2
million, operation operational

121
00:08:33,595 --> 00:08:37,855
connection daily basis with peak load
during admission and discharge period,

122
00:08:38,155 --> 00:08:40,525
reaching out about 3000 ions per minute.

123
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:44,405
If you talk about the more
how the healthcare data growth

124
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:46,324
and processing metrics, right?

125
00:08:46,474 --> 00:08:49,655
The annual metadata
growth rate is around 54%.

126
00:08:51,349 --> 00:08:54,770
We have to talk about the real
time processing because we are

127
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:58,760
talking patient monitoring,
resource allocations, emergency

128
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,430
responses, and operational dashboard.

129
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,079
As I said, there are 44.3%
improvement in real time analytics

130
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:11,919
capabilities by just implementing
a proper and enhanced version,

131
00:09:14,109 --> 00:09:17,574
a proper and enhanced version
of healthcare systems.

132
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:22,259
So when we talk about the systems we
can see our storage layer architecture.

133
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,619
Modern healthcare data warehouse
storage architecture have evolved

134
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:29,459
significantly to address the exponential
growth in medical data complexity.

135
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:35,519
The structural data storage component,
leverage modeling optimizes specifically

136
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,389
for the healthcare workload.

137
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,759
And you can see we are implementing
star schema normally in healthcare

138
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:47,249
facilities at implementing a structured
data that more than 180,000 daily

139
00:09:47,249 --> 00:09:51,239
percent transaction while maintaining
sub-second queries response.

140
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:56,939
For 88% of anus queries performance
analysis from leading healthcare

141
00:09:56,939 --> 00:10:00,989
institution source that properly
implemented dimension models can

142
00:10:00,989 --> 00:10:05,159
maintain consistent query performance,
even when processing a log queue

143
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,749
data spanning three to five years.

144
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:12,314
Organizations utilizing modern storage
optimization techniques have reported

145
00:10:13,004 --> 00:10:18,134
compressions ratio address of 6.1 for
clinical data resulting in substantial

146
00:10:18,194 --> 00:10:22,814
storage efficiency improvement while
maintaining critical performance record.

147
00:10:23,534 --> 00:10:26,894
The unstructured data management
capabilities have become increasingly

148
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:32,669
sophisticated as healthcare organization
deal with growing volumes of narrative.

149
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,169
Clinical content.

150
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:38,369
Current implementation shows that
unstructured data account for approximate

151
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:40,409
67% of total healthcare data volume.

152
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:43,289
With a typical hospitals, you can say

153
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,599
modern document stores have around
demonstrate significant improvement

154
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:53,234
in test processing capabilities
and achieve the success rate.

155
00:10:54,204 --> 00:10:59,264
Healthcare organizations utilizing
flexible schema design using JSON format

156
00:10:59,624 --> 00:11:03,614
have reported a 39% improvement because
data is coming unstructured format a

157
00:11:03,614 --> 00:11:11,864
lot, and it'll basically reduce the time
of data processing and manage around

158
00:11:11,864 --> 00:11:16,814
75 to a hundred million documents while
daily injection rate of around 15,000.

159
00:11:16,814 --> 00:11:17,564
New document.

160
00:11:17,774 --> 00:11:20,714
In a medium, medium to large
healthcare facility, you can see.

161
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:24,839
The integration between the structured
and unru data component through

162
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,649
reference pointers has emerged
as a crucial architecture feature

163
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:31,869
in our analytics layer architecture.

164
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:35,289
This analytics layer
architecture, if you talk about

165
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:40,569
our analytics layer, if you talk about
this layer where the machine learning

166
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:45,099
models and predictive algorithms
come into the picture in this model.

167
00:11:45,954 --> 00:11:49,374
The modern healthcare warehouse
has undergone significant

168
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:53,484
evolution to meet the demanding
requirements of healthcare operation.

169
00:11:54,384 --> 00:11:57,624

a 40% improvement in resource

182
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:50,529
allocation efficiently, and a
38% reduction in response time.

183
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:56,109
The batch processing infrastructure
that handle the complex analytics

184
00:12:56,109 --> 00:13:01,059
workload, that crucial for the healthcare
quality, our the ETL workflow in the

185
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:05,319
current healthcare system, manage an
average of 65 million records daily.

186
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:08,949
With peak processing volume,
reaching around 120 million

187
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:11,139
records during high demand periods.

188
00:13:11,739 --> 00:13:15,789
The organization we are implementing
in optimized ETL pipelines that achieve

189
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:20,049
transformation rates of approximate
1.8 million records per minute.

190
00:13:21,849 --> 00:13:25,749
Machine learning models that train
the pipelines have demonstrated

191
00:13:25,749 --> 00:13:30,339
significant advancement in healthcare
analytics, the machine learning pipeline

192
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:33,534
process, and average of eight terabyte
of historical percent data daily.

193
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:40,149
The capabilities for historical
trend analysis with modern system

194
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:44,079
efficiently processing three to five
years of historical data compromising

195
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,229
approximately seven 50000000% encounters.

196
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:54,129
When we talk about the performance
optimization and bi, the strategy

197
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:57,129
Healthcare data warehouse requires is.

198
00:13:59,814 --> 00:14:03,714
Sophisticated optimization strategy
to maintain performance at a scale,

199
00:14:05,904 --> 00:14:10,914
the query performance improve
and the cloud storage cost will

200
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:14,634
definitely improve, but it helped
to process the record faster.

201
00:14:15,324 --> 00:14:18,984
Modern healthcare facility typically
manage between three to five,

202
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:23,964
five petabytes of archive active
data with daily query volume.

203
00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:28,689
Reaching around 350,000 analyticals
requests distributed across various

204
00:14:28,689 --> 00:14:30,569
clinical and administrative department.

205
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:36,239
We are implementing the parting
strategies that evolve significantly

206
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:39,659
with the introduction of machine learning
driven partition scheme selection.

207
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,169
Partitioning framework can reduce
query execution time by 60% for

208
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:51,089
times risk analysis queries,
which represent approximate 58% of

209
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:52,889
analytical workload in healthcare.

210
00:14:54,884 --> 00:14:56,894
Healthcare organization
implementing is smart.

211
00:14:56,894 --> 00:15:02,144
Partitioning typically between 12
to 50 active partition point table.

212
00:15:04,664 --> 00:15:09,044
But by using the machine learning
integration, the diagnostic support,

213
00:15:09,464 --> 00:15:14,804
treatment planning and readmission
prevention, we can see more than 40%

214
00:15:14,804 --> 00:15:17,269
improvement in diagnostic accuracy
through the machine learning models.

215
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:21,629
Treatment planning is also
improved around 36.7% reduction

216
00:15:21,869 --> 00:15:23,039
in treatment planning time.

217
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:31,849
Machine learning help us to
improve the whole the whole time.

218
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:35,749
How can we make our time and
utilize the time more efficiently?

219
00:15:35,989 --> 00:15:40,699
The response time under 150
milliseconds for 88% of frequently

220
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:45,139
executed queries when you're
using column storage optimization.

221
00:15:46,414 --> 00:15:50,434
That benefited from Advanced com
algorithm and integrated data layout

222
00:15:50,434 --> 00:15:55,444
strategy integration with BI tool
has evolved through the adoption

223
00:15:55,444 --> 00:15:58,814
of, inte, inte intelligent query
routing and casing mechanism.

224
00:15:59,814 --> 00:16:03,984
The data storage optimization, we go
with three different format, hot data,

225
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:06,444
warm data tier, and the core data here.

226
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:07,899
Hot data means what?

227
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:11,739
Basically the high performance in memory
processing for missing critical present

228
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:14,019
information requiring instant access.

229
00:16:14,229 --> 00:16:19,269
For example, real time monitoring system,
active treatment protocol, or fast

230
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:21,189
retrieval of emergency clinical decisions.

231
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:22,779
Warm data.

232
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:24,819
Basically the balance, performance cost.

233
00:16:24,969 --> 00:16:26,829
SSD stories, high speed.

234
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:30,344
S-S-D-R-A comprehensive 30 to
90 days clinical histories.

235
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:32,769
Upcoming appointments.

236
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:33,759
See during and follow up.

237
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:37,659
You can see as scholar a warm data,
which frequently accessed cold data

238
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:41,739
is basically cloud-based archival
solution, secure cloud archiving.

239
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:46,359
With compliance certified encryptions,
we can regularly compliance records

240
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:47,979
with tamper proof audit traces.

241
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:52,179
Data will be saved successfully
and it'll be archive.

242
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:55,539
We are using ING approach, machine
learning approach for that.

243
00:16:57,204 --> 00:17:01,884
Data access layer performance
optimization has been re ized by

244
00:17:01,884 --> 00:17:05,304
predictive query optimization and
intelligence casting strategy.

245
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:10,824
Healthcare recognition Report that
machine learning enhanced view

246
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:16,554
ization strategy reduce an average
report generation time by 58% while

247
00:17:16,554 --> 00:17:22,014
supporting an average of 2,800
concurrent query sessions continuously.

248
00:17:23,784 --> 00:17:27,384
Modern healthcare data warehouse
must address complex scalability

249
00:17:27,384 --> 00:17:31,194
challenge while ensuring consistent
performance and data accessibility.

250
00:17:32,304 --> 00:17:36,744
Our studies indicate that healthcare
organization implementing cloud-based

251
00:17:36,744 --> 00:17:40,554
scalability and framework achieve
around one 34% high data processing

252
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:45,114
throughput, and 71% improved query
performance during high demand period.

253
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:48,984
In the healthcare domain
where everything is data.

254
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:51,279
We have to access the data.

255
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,199
So query optimization must to be improved.

256
00:17:54,129 --> 00:17:57,489
We are implementing the query
optimization, indexing strategies,

257
00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:03,539
data partitioning and compression
techniques, indexing strategy that

258
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:07,769
custom healthcare specific indexing
patterns like which by which pattern?

259
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:08,999
The data will be searched a lot.

260
00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:14,579
We can use that pattern to implement
indexes to make query performance faster.

261
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:17,609
Load balancing mechanism
have evolved to become.

262
00:18:19,034 --> 00:18:21,614
To become increasing sophisticated
in healthcare environment,

263
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:28,184
the development methodology significantly
influence implementation outcomes.

264
00:18:28,184 --> 00:18:32,354
In healthcare settings, organizations
start adopting I implementation

265
00:18:32,504 --> 00:18:36,914
strategy and they can report around
65% of higher project success rate.

266
00:18:37,664 --> 00:18:43,994
By time to time, the implementation
of cap capacity planning

267
00:18:43,994 --> 00:18:47,204
process have become increasingly
critical in health environment.

268
00:18:48,104 --> 00:18:53,414
Because data will be stored and
need to access from their ions.

269
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:58,124
Performance optimization process
is evolved a lot to incorporate

270
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,164
healthcare specific requirements.

271
00:19:00,164 --> 00:19:06,014
Organization report that it'll reduce
their average execution time and

272
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:09,494
improve the resource utilization
and improve the performance

273
00:19:11,804 --> 00:19:12,494
when you make it.

274
00:19:12,494 --> 00:19:13,459
There is many challenges.

275
00:19:14,264 --> 00:19:17,564
Because data is coming from the structured
data, unstructured data use volume

276
00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:22,784
of the data, a lot of data, how to
integrate with the EHR system, with a

277
00:19:22,784 --> 00:19:26,894
legacy system, with a security complex,
comprehensive, unstructured data.

278
00:19:27,404 --> 00:19:33,164
This all will be taken care if you
balance our system right, and create

279
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:38,294
our system in such a way so that
everything will be managed and enhanced.

280
00:19:38,294 --> 00:19:41,294
The query performance we have
to implement our roadmap.

281
00:19:41,969 --> 00:19:47,879
Assessment and planning, architecture,
design, pilot implementation, and we

282
00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:49,379
have to full development and training.

283
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:54,899
We have to understand how exactly
the architecture matters because a

284
00:19:54,899 --> 00:19:57,659
multi-layer design delivered around 48%.

285
00:19:57,659 --> 00:19:59,519
You can see improvement
in processing efficiency.

286
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:02,549
We have to focus on the primary goal.

287
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:03,779
Performance will be faster.

288
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:06,059
Present outcome as a primary goal.

289
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:08,519
The stakeholder involvement
is very necessary.

290
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:14,999
Build comprehensive into a
foundation, not as per afterthought.

291
00:20:15,989 --> 00:20:20,339
So just one thing here, I want to say
in the last that the implementation of

292
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:25,139
predictive analysis data warehouse has
fundamentally transformed modern hospital

293
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:28,409
management by enabling data driven
decision making across all operational

294
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:30,569
aspect healthcare organization.

295
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:35,264
Adopting these sophisticated architecture
frameworks have demonstrated significant

296
00:20:35,264 --> 00:20:36,904
improvement in patient care quality.

297
00:20:37,484 --> 00:20:39,674
Operational efficiency
and resource utilization.

298
00:20:40,184 --> 00:20:43,814
The success of these implementation
relies on carefully balanced architecture

299
00:20:44,174 --> 00:20:48,434
decisions that address the unique
challenges of healthcare data management,

300
00:20:48,494 --> 00:20:52,184
including the integration of diverse
data sources, realtime processing

301
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:58,784
requirement and significant security
standard, and the evolution of machine

302
00:20:58,784 --> 00:21:00,764
learning, enhanced optimization strategy.

303
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:05,669
Coupled with advanced storage solution
and analytics capabilities has

304
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:09,659
created a robust platform capable of
supporting both current operational

305
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:11,939
needs and future scalable requirement.

306
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:17,564
As healthcare continues to generate
increasingly complex and a lot of volume

307
00:21:17,564 --> 00:21:21,464
data, the importance of well-designed
predictive analysis data warehouse

308
00:21:21,704 --> 00:21:27,314
becomes even more critical for maintaining
high performance healthcare delivery

309
00:21:27,314 --> 00:21:31,814
system while ensuring patient data
security and mobility competencies.

310
00:21:32,264 --> 00:21:36,944
So it is very required how to make
our system in a much better way.

311
00:21:36,974 --> 00:21:39,524
Thank you so much for
joining this session.

312
00:21:40,664 --> 00:21:41,054
