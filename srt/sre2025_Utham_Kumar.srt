1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,810
Hello everyone, and
thank you for joining me.

2
00:00:03,349 --> 00:00:07,250
I'm excited to explore how site
reliability engineering practices

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,255
can power high performance payment
systems in emerging markets.

4
00:00:11,755 --> 00:00:15,055
Now with the limited banking
infrastructure, but widespread mobile

5
00:00:15,235 --> 00:00:18,695
use, these digital payments play a
crucial role in bringing financial

6
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:20,450
services to underserved communities.

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,119
Let me move on to the next slide.

8
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,310
Let's begin with an overview of the
technical architecture that supports

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,830
financial inclusion in these regions.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,000
I'll walk you through how various
components like APIs, blockchain,

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,490
and analytics and hybrid cloud
edge setups come together to build

12
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,530
a resilient payment ecosystem.

13
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:44,590
Now the objective is to
deliver a reliable, low latency

14
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,270
transition transactions.

15
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,090
I'm sorry, even in areas with
intermittent connectivity.

16
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,910
Moving on to the next slide.

17
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:57,410
Emerging markets present a unique
challenge, power outage, limited internet

18
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,020
speeds and regulatory complexities.

19
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:01,040
Now.

20
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:08,210
For overcoming all these barriers, we
need a fault tolerant design offline

21
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:13,070
capabilities and adaptable compliance
frameworks to navigate these obstacles.

22
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:18,740
Now think of rural areas where
two G or 3G networks dominate

23
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,990
and power might be out for hours.

24
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,970
Our systems must still function.

25
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,905
Now that's where we are
talking about reliability.

26
00:01:26,405 --> 00:01:29,315
Reliability metrics that really matter.

27
00:01:29,315 --> 00:01:33,635
The reliability metrics become
essential in measuring how well we

28
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,795
perform under these Haas conditions.

29
00:01:36,295 --> 00:01:42,875
Now, hybrid chlor cloud edge models often
show near perfect reliability, but then

30
00:01:43,505 --> 00:01:47,285
processing locally and a synchronizing
one's connectivity is risk stop.

31
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:52,025
That kind of an approach is very good
for in these kind of situations of these.

32
00:01:52,835 --> 00:01:57,875
Further, these approaches help maintain
97 percentage or higher transaction

33
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:04,025
success rates, which already impacts trust
and user adoption in underserved areas.

34
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:09,045
Moving on, let's look at specific
SRE practices that have driven

35
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,385
significant improvements in reliability.

36
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:14,345
All of these concepts are very
important for reliability, like we

37
00:02:14,345 --> 00:02:17,735
were talking about in the previous
slides, where there are several

38
00:02:17,735 --> 00:02:22,205
other infrastructure situations that
we'll have to take take care of now,

39
00:02:22,265 --> 00:02:27,515
advanced observability and distributing
tracing across all the services and

40
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:32,230
helping pinpoint issues and complex
heterogeneous environments all those

41
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,560
things is very important in this aspect.

42
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,290
And again, automated remediation.

43
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,710
And how engineering prepare
our systems to self-heal and

44
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,660
recover from regional failures.

45
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,780
That is very important in the
situation where we are talking

46
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,410
about power infrastructure not
being available for multiple hours.

47
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,990
Now, coupled with procession, SLOs,
these strategies have cut payment

48
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,910
failures by over 60 percentage.

49
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,405
We move on to the next slide.

50
00:02:59,905 --> 00:03:05,545
So to implement these SRE strategies
effectively, we follow a phased roadmap.

51
00:03:06,115 --> 00:03:10,045
First, we establish a baseline
metrics and simple monitoring.

52
00:03:10,605 --> 00:03:14,055
Then we introduce distributor
tracing and AVA testing.

53
00:03:14,535 --> 00:03:17,985
Finally, we move to AI
driven productive analytics.

54
00:03:18,495 --> 00:03:23,355
Now, this approach provides incremental
wins while steadily advancing

55
00:03:23,355 --> 00:03:26,655
towards a robust mature reliability.

56
00:03:27,155 --> 00:03:28,775
Cultural change is equally important.

57
00:03:29,015 --> 00:03:34,455
Reliability champions must be embedded
in dev teams, so that is equally as

58
00:03:34,455 --> 00:03:37,150
permanent as the other aspects of this.

59
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:44,695
Moving on, SRE in emerging markets also
calls for a context adjusted SLIs in SLOs.

60
00:03:45,195 --> 00:03:51,010
For instance a 99.95% success rate
might be adjusted to 97 percentage in

61
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,810
rural zones where connectivity is beyond
our control Now, ensuring fairness

62
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,020
and realistic targets just to make
sure you have a fair ground to play.

63
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,170
Now we pay tailoring these service level
objectives to real world conditions.

64
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,160
We keep teams motivated and still
accountable for what they can influence.

65
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,170
Moving on.

66
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:14,380
AI powered capabilities amplify
our resilience, shifting from

67
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,570
reactive to predictive reliability.

68
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:23,680
Now mission learning flags, unusual
transaction patterns, readouts data

69
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,070
around poor networks and blocks a
suspicious activity in real time.

70
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,160
With ai, up to 87 percentage
of the potential incidents are

71
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,350
caught before the effect uses.

72
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,590
That's a very huge jump from
threshold based systems.

73
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,950
Now let's examine a real world case.

74
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,050
Wherein we are talking, we
are gonna talk about a rural

75
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,670
healthcare payments platform.

76
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,969
This was one of the very
important and widely recognized

77
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:50,659
implementation world case.

78
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:53,364
That real world case that was
discussed in several areas.

79
00:04:53,864 --> 00:04:57,944
Serving millions of patients under two
G connectivity and frequent power autos.

80
00:04:58,244 --> 00:05:02,684
They've applied offline first
architecture and regional SLOs.

81
00:05:03,184 --> 00:05:08,335
The result transaction reliability sold
from 78 percentage to over 99 percentage,

82
00:05:08,335 --> 00:05:09,864
which is almost a hundred percentage.

83
00:05:10,254 --> 00:05:13,525
And patient satisfaction
jumped significantly, which

84
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:14,874
is crucial in this aspect.

85
00:05:15,374 --> 00:05:21,284
So for a technical deep dive service,
mesh architectures have shown tremendous

86
00:05:21,284 --> 00:05:23,414
values in these payment environments.

87
00:05:24,284 --> 00:05:30,255
Oh, where starting networking,
security observability of mesh empowers

88
00:05:30,284 --> 00:05:35,025
apps to focus on business logic,
even in a hybrid or legacy system.

89
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:39,485
Now in several cases, incident
resolutions has become 83

90
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:43,475
percentage faster, and security
incidents dropped by 76 percentage.

91
00:05:43,745 --> 00:05:49,235
Once policies were uniformly enforced
across all services, now that uniformity

92
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:54,245
accounts for making sure that your systems
are robust, that performance oriented,

93
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:57,395
and you have a very highly secure system.

94
00:05:57,895 --> 00:05:58,345
Moving on.

95
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:02,935
I just wanna quickly wrap up with
some key takeaways for tech leaders

96
00:06:02,935 --> 00:06:06,505
aiming to become, bring financial
services to emerging markets.

97
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:11,605
First, adapt, SRE Best
practices to local realities.

98
00:06:11,665 --> 00:06:15,115
Use the region specific SLOs and offline
capabilities like we were talking

99
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:19,645
about, how to make sure we have a
fair play on for every one of us that.

100
00:06:20,305 --> 00:06:24,085
Secondly, design for resilience
in corporate edge computing,

101
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:26,275
caching, and robust synchronization.

102
00:06:27,175 --> 00:06:32,005
Third, remain user centered reliability,
must directly enhance financial inclusion.

103
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:37,665
Lastly, adopt a phased approach to
implementation, and these will make sure

104
00:06:37,724 --> 00:06:40,094
we have a great implementation in place.

105
00:06:40,594 --> 00:06:42,094
So finally, thank you.

106
00:06:42,155 --> 00:06:43,474
Thank you so much for your attention.

107
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,000
I appreciate your time and I hope
these strategies for context of

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,570
our SRE help you build reliable,
inclusive, and payment systems.

109
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:54,710
If you have any questions or would like
additional details, please let me know

110
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,789
and be allowed to discuss and how we
can collaborate to advance financial

111
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:01,010
inclusion in challenging environments.

112
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:02,630
Thank you very much.

113
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:03,395
Bye.
