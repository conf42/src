1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
Hi everybody.

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,550
I'm Greg Lind, CEO, and founder of.

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,020
build these a software
architecture as a service, company.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,259
We have, open source products
and, products, labs, which is our,

5
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:15,899
product management through ai.

6
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,379
And, Product managers,
human as human oversight.

7
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:25,640
Also, managing partner at Open Build where
we do, open source management programs

8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:31,070
and mentorship programs for junior
developers to senior and senior to CTO.

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,860
but we're here to talk about,
radical therapy for software teams.

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,530
we wrote this book over the last
couple of years, but the focus on

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,190
it, was really about transparency,
and how to use that as a team, tool

12
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,250
to build for, successful teams.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,610
it's a lot about the fusion of dev
and product teams, which is also

14
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,170
what we've built into Build Link.

15
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:54,710
it's a big.

16
00:00:55,294 --> 00:00:59,744
milestone for us because we've
also added that to our, AI built-in

17
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:01,664
knowledge for our product manager.

18
00:01:02,024 --> 00:01:05,914
So you can actually use the tool and
get some insights from the book as well.

19
00:01:06,475 --> 00:01:09,655
but we'll go into in depth
today a little bit about.

20
00:01:10,264 --> 00:01:13,405
How to get started with,
radical transparency as well as,

21
00:01:13,464 --> 00:01:15,294
therapy for your software teams.

22
00:01:15,764 --> 00:01:19,214
and we will get a little more,
deeper into what those mean.

23
00:01:19,214 --> 00:01:24,565
So radical, obviously for us, it
means something that's, fundamental,

24
00:01:24,595 --> 00:01:29,304
changing something at a drastic
and a far reaching effect, right?

25
00:01:29,374 --> 00:01:32,554
not radicalness in Jeff, right?

26
00:01:32,554 --> 00:01:35,375
So we're not talking about surfers,
we're talking about radical.

27
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,860
It's a big change.

28
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,940
And therapy.

29
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:44,470
obviously I'm not a licensed therapist,
but I do see a lot of, software

30
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:49,119
developers in my, as a manager
and as I work with as colleagues.

31
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,369
that need help often, outside of work
sometimes, but related to work, having

32
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:57,939
to deal with things and you start to
feel, if you've ever managed a team

33
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:01,689
or if you've ever managed a product,
you know how it can feel sometimes.

34
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:03,490
Like you're also helping.

35
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,714
I. Folks through struggles, you're helping
them, to build their trust, accountability

36
00:02:07,714 --> 00:02:09,574
with them and with each other.

37
00:02:09,974 --> 00:02:13,604
so a lot of times you feel like
a professional therapist, right?

38
00:02:13,664 --> 00:02:17,534
But maybe you just play one on TV
or play one in product management.

39
00:02:18,045 --> 00:02:20,414
So we'll go into a
little bit more on that.

40
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:22,354
but let's start with the transparency.

41
00:02:22,504 --> 00:02:26,994
specifically the principles, but
transparency, first off, which is really

42
00:02:26,994 --> 00:02:31,944
just about open communication, encouraging
clear and honest dialogue with each

43
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:35,724
other and with your team as well as
with the larger organization, right?

44
00:02:35,724 --> 00:02:40,134
Transparency, however you're working, if
you're on a startup or a big organization.

45
00:02:40,674 --> 00:02:45,634
Having a clear and transparent
process as well as, open dialogue

46
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:49,174
with the rest of the organization's
only gonna help remove blocks.

47
00:02:50,014 --> 00:02:53,584
I think the other side of this is
data-driven decision making, right?

48
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:58,024
So collecting data and using it
for how, for your product to make

49
00:02:58,024 --> 00:03:02,014
it better as well as help to even
improve your process and your team.

50
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:04,744
So part of this is about taking things.

51
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:09,784
From Agile and other things like that
and adapting it to use it in a cloud

52
00:03:09,784 --> 00:03:14,704
native way, a microservice driven way
maybe, but also multi repository way.

53
00:03:15,204 --> 00:03:19,504
And how to use that to better
make decisions when you get data,

54
00:03:19,904 --> 00:03:23,164
and be able to apply that to
your decision making processes.

55
00:03:23,614 --> 00:03:27,704
Part of that's feedback, ongoing feedback
throughout your process from your team,

56
00:03:27,704 --> 00:03:31,634
as well as eventually your customers
and bringing that into the process.

57
00:03:32,384 --> 00:03:34,384
And then, inclusivity and diversity.

58
00:03:34,384 --> 00:03:40,544
I. diversity in terms of perspectives, as
well as, diversity in terms of the types

59
00:03:40,544 --> 00:03:42,014
of folks you're bringing into your team.

60
00:03:42,414 --> 00:03:44,394
ensuring that all of
those voices are heard.

61
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,289
and really part of the diversity
approach to this is also about just

62
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:51,809
getting those different ideas, right?

63
00:03:51,809 --> 00:03:55,729
Hearing, different perspectives gives
you a better product as long as you're

64
00:03:55,729 --> 00:03:57,799
willing to actually adapt and use those.

65
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,389
and then bringing your backlogs.

66
00:04:00,634 --> 00:04:04,234
Product backlog and merging it
with your developer backlog, right?

67
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:07,894
So having one process where everybody's
seeing where everything's doing

68
00:04:07,894 --> 00:04:11,374
it, and that's a lot of what we do
with product labs at ly, but it's

69
00:04:11,374 --> 00:04:15,409
also just about a simple way to do
that in terms of process overall.

70
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:17,809
So we wanna break down silos.

71
00:04:18,764 --> 00:04:19,784
Be more efficient.

72
00:04:20,224 --> 00:04:24,394
promote cross-functional communication,
collaboration, and then share insights

73
00:04:24,394 --> 00:04:28,954
between DevOps, product teams,
managers, developers, all of that,

74
00:04:29,474 --> 00:04:33,974
transparency, optimization, and,
reduce your time to market, right?

75
00:04:34,364 --> 00:04:38,004
Build something, do it
quick, and then, but focus on

76
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:39,874
quality and focus on feedback.

77
00:04:40,564 --> 00:04:44,994
That's really the best approach
for this is, and starting with that

78
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:46,464
is data-driven decision making.

79
00:04:46,464 --> 00:04:49,794
So helping you to make decisions faster.

80
00:04:50,184 --> 00:04:53,414
one of the best ways to do
that is to get feedback, And

81
00:04:53,414 --> 00:04:54,884
bring that into your process.

82
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:58,544
And then you are also getting higher
engagement and retention that way.

83
00:04:58,594 --> 00:05:02,734
People that feel invested in a product
are people that feel like their voices

84
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:07,564
are heard in the process, as well as
just feedback in terms of what they

85
00:05:07,564 --> 00:05:10,294
like about the product and what they
would like to see in the future.

86
00:05:10,984 --> 00:05:14,104
you're also reducing
conflict and resolution time.

87
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:18,934
When you're bringing in, you can show
a data point and you can show how

88
00:05:18,994 --> 00:05:21,754
to get through a conflict by just.

89
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:26,884
Showing to them, to a team member,
to a, a customer, to a manager.

90
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,344
If you can show them data,
they're obviously gonna be

91
00:05:29,344 --> 00:05:30,664
able, much easier to persuade.

92
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:35,734
So some companies that bring this
decision making process and radical

93
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:37,924
transparency in Atlassian's a great one.

94
00:05:38,414 --> 00:05:43,614
Google has a great, process where they
bring in, Teams and cross-functional

95
00:05:43,614 --> 00:05:48,774
teams that share, developers to
share members across each one, right?

96
00:05:48,774 --> 00:05:49,854
So they move back and forth.

97
00:05:49,854 --> 00:05:53,194
They all have the same process,
but they learn from each other

98
00:05:53,194 --> 00:05:55,174
by sharing team members across.

99
00:05:55,784 --> 00:06:00,334
Zappos is another one that had the
same sort of process and, Trust

100
00:06:00,334 --> 00:06:02,044
and ethical AI implementation.

101
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:07,764
IBM and their fairness, 360 and Netflix
and their responsible AI toolkit.

102
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:11,304
I'm not sure how much they're still
implementing that at Netflix anymore,

103
00:06:11,724 --> 00:06:17,244
but, they do have some great processes
around how to, bring responsibility in ai

104
00:06:17,304 --> 00:06:21,284
and that helps you bring, better data and
better decision making processes, right?

105
00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:22,964
So key steps.

106
00:06:23,844 --> 00:06:26,304
Establish a culture of open communication.

107
00:06:26,764 --> 00:06:31,384
again, that means, sharing what
you've done right from day one.

108
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:35,304
the scary thing for developers when
they come work with us at LY is,

109
00:06:35,734 --> 00:06:37,009
day one, you need to commit code.

110
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:41,429
I. It doesn't matter what type
of, product you're working on

111
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,259
that we need to see that commit.

112
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:47,639
Go into a branch, that's your branch
and you're gonna get feedback on it.

113
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:49,439
It's gonna be a little scary at first.

114
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:51,969
it's definitely unusual for some.

115
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,269
But, we also focus on,
positive feedback, right?

116
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:58,209
And making people feel good
about those steps, getting those

117
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,549
first movement into this process.

118
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:04,239
Again, data decision making
processes accessible.

119
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:07,259
So that means, not only
do you need to share.

120
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:10,259
What you're doing, but how you
came to that decision, right?

121
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:15,279
So where did that come from and how to
make that more accessible is just by

122
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:20,469
opening up your process, opening up your
backlog to your team, to your customers.

123
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:24,659
everyone should have access to
that and encouraging that feedback

124
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:28,379
and asking for it, asking for
criticism, hopefully constructive.

125
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:32,689
but certainly within your team, you can
ensure that it's constructive criticism.

126
00:07:33,574 --> 00:07:37,054
And then, introduce transparent
performance and compensation policies.

127
00:07:37,414 --> 00:07:42,284
So a lot of team conflict, doesn't
revolve around compensation, but

128
00:07:42,524 --> 00:07:45,584
within an organization, within a
management, if somebody's unhappy,

129
00:07:46,124 --> 00:07:49,994
usually it's because of compensation
or it's because of people that they're

130
00:07:49,994 --> 00:07:53,144
having to report to or sometimes
too many people to report to, right?

131
00:07:53,444 --> 00:07:56,384
So being transparent around
performance and how to get better.

132
00:07:56,849 --> 00:08:00,959
And sharing those compensation policies
and showing people how to move forward

133
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:05,399
both within your team and within
your organization, and then integrate

134
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:09,749
those transparencies into product
development along with AI ethics, right?

135
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:11,849
So everyone's using AI for something now.

136
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:15,748
you need to make sure that when you're
testing that ai, it's not just about.

137
00:08:16,613 --> 00:08:18,353
the LLM that built it, right?

138
00:08:18,353 --> 00:08:22,193
You need to test it both from your
production standpoint to see what

139
00:08:22,193 --> 00:08:26,754
people are, actually sending to
your ai, models and then also from

140
00:08:27,114 --> 00:08:29,274
your own, processes and tools.

141
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:32,934
How are you actually testing it before
it goes out, and how are you making

142
00:08:32,934 --> 00:08:37,674
sure that those ethical compliance
tools are embedded in that process

143
00:08:37,674 --> 00:08:38,664
so that you're making sure that.

144
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:43,384
It's not weighted in one direction
or that it's not, doing something

145
00:08:43,384 --> 00:08:46,594
that you don't even know when
it's suggesting to your customers.

146
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:49,434
let's talk a little bit about
enhanced innovation and problems.

147
00:08:49,494 --> 00:08:52,404
So diverse teams bring
very perspective, right?

148
00:08:52,404 --> 00:08:55,464
So what we wanna look for in diversity is.

149
00:08:56,094 --> 00:08:56,994
Innovation, right?

150
00:08:56,994 --> 00:09:00,714
So in diversity helps drive
innovation and problem solving.

151
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:04,944
So diverse teams bring varied perspectives
leading to more creative solutions

152
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,594
and better decision making processes.

153
00:09:06,954 --> 00:09:10,734
Stronger team performance and
productivity in inclusive teams

154
00:09:11,234 --> 00:09:15,874
prove, this is a McKinsey report that
showed that 35% better performance by

155
00:09:15,874 --> 00:09:19,684
leveraging different experiences and
skills versus non-inclusive teams.

156
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,164
That means.

157
00:09:21,004 --> 00:09:25,594
If you have a team that's diverse and
has a lot of different perspectives,

158
00:09:25,964 --> 00:09:29,564
you're getting better performance as well
as a better product out of that, right?

159
00:09:29,564 --> 00:09:32,174
And as a variety of skills.

160
00:09:32,174 --> 00:09:36,284
Along with that, better representation
and market reach, a diverse

161
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,464
team reflects the reality of who
you're trying to sell to, right?

162
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:43,279
So the, if you want to build something
that's user friendly and competitive,

163
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:45,919
diversity's gonna help with that, right?

164
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:46,959
Who's this guy?

165
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:48,669
This the cheerleader, right?

166
00:09:48,669 --> 00:09:53,674
So what, when we say we're talking
about, Being positive, right?

167
00:09:54,004 --> 00:09:57,354
And we're talking about being, an
encouraging person on your team.

168
00:09:57,624 --> 00:10:01,629
It doesn't mean go out and be rah,
yay, and super positive all the time.

169
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:05,839
it means trying to keep your team
positive by helping them with ways that

170
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,759
help sometimes, especially software
developers aren't comfortable, talking.

171
00:10:11,554 --> 00:10:12,334
Communicating.

172
00:10:12,554 --> 00:10:15,494
But helping them get out of their
shell, helping them get out and

173
00:10:15,494 --> 00:10:17,684
be part of the team is important.

174
00:10:18,194 --> 00:10:22,714
And that means doing that in a careful
and thoughtful way, and not in a,

175
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:24,304
in your face kind of way, right?

176
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:26,464
So team morale is important.

177
00:10:26,884 --> 00:10:28,369
You wanna focus on trust.

178
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:32,819
Safety when somebody's in that team
promote transparency and with team

179
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:36,899
members, but also try to reduce the stress
and workplace anxiety around it, right?

180
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:40,139
Encouraging open communication
with daily check-ins.

181
00:10:40,229 --> 00:10:43,079
Those can be online in Slack,
which most people are doing now.

182
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:46,739
If ideally, you're doing it
face-to-face so that you can

183
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:48,969
adjust, right there real time.

184
00:10:48,969 --> 00:10:52,939
But if you're not, online is great as
long as people are actually reading.

185
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:54,114
Those contributions.

186
00:10:54,164 --> 00:10:58,604
A lot of times when we do Slack check-ins,
I'm the only one that reads those things

187
00:10:58,994 --> 00:11:02,294
and you, that's great because I can
help remove some blocks and then I can

188
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:03,944
go back through and make some changes.

189
00:11:03,944 --> 00:11:06,734
But you really need to get your
team involved in making sure that

190
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:07,874
they're reading that as well.

191
00:11:08,684 --> 00:11:11,834
Celebrate wins and reduce
burnout and frustration.

192
00:11:11,894 --> 00:11:13,929
A clear one of the goals around.

193
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:18,179
This whole process has been to
help people feel more comfortable,

194
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,819
within teams and feel like they
have a path forward, and upward.

195
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:26,539
And one, the, one of the ways to do
that is, is to really celebrate and

196
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:30,919
show growth, but also really focus
on folks that are down like that are

197
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:35,149
having a rough time helping to bring
them up, both from your process and

198
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:38,929
your giving them clear goals, but
also just from how you work with them.

199
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:40,399
What tools are they working with?

200
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,539
Maybe they're getting, Over, burdened
with too many tools, or maybe they're,

201
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:46,369
they don't have the right tool yet.

202
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:48,219
so a lot of it's about that as well.

203
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:51,569
And then empowering folks with
autonomy and ownership, right?

204
00:11:52,229 --> 00:11:54,959
Employees have access to
information and decision making.

205
00:11:55,109 --> 00:11:59,159
They feel more accountable and invested
in their work, and that helps them.

206
00:11:59,464 --> 00:12:01,864
To feel like they're part of
that team, they're part of that

207
00:12:01,864 --> 00:12:03,424
product and they wanna see it grow.

208
00:12:03,484 --> 00:12:05,134
They want to see it get better, right?

209
00:12:05,644 --> 00:12:09,844
So you wanna run a product like
a lean startup and run a startup,

210
00:12:09,874 --> 00:12:11,134
like an open source project.

211
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:12,599
How do you do that?

212
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:13,829
And why would you do that?

213
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:14,609
One?

214
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:18,869
It encourages sharing work openly
and asking for feedback, right?

215
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,579
That's what open source projects want.

216
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:24,539
Like maybe they aren't great about
adapting to it, or they get overwhelmed

217
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:27,809
by it a lot of times, but that is
what they want and that's how we wanna

218
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:29,849
bring that process back to a startup.

219
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,439
Same thing with the startup.

220
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:35,029
A project that you're working on
inside your organization, right?

221
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:40,294
A larger organization still needs to feel
like there's communication, like there's a

222
00:12:40,444 --> 00:12:45,454
path forward, for everybody and promoting
a community that, con contributes

223
00:12:45,454 --> 00:12:47,484
to that creates innovation, right?

224
00:12:47,484 --> 00:12:49,464
Every organization wants
to have innovation.

225
00:12:49,464 --> 00:12:53,514
They wanna drive that in their
products, in their projects, and

226
00:12:53,544 --> 00:12:55,254
that means bringing that process in.

227
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:58,799
And emphasize the importance of
building inclusive communities while

228
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,089
you're doing that helps you bring
innovation, but also helps you bring

229
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:08,729
everybody along with you and embrace
competition, build new markets, right?

230
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:13,629
you don't, just because I.
Something existed already, doesn't

231
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:14,889
mean you can't make it better.

232
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,929
Why not build a better mousetrap?

233
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,039
I hate that analogy of don't try to
build a better mousetrap, but the

234
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:25,749
reality is there's plenty of products
that are okay, but they don't quite fit.

235
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,169
So make the product you want.

236
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:32,039
And if it's not in the marketplace,
go out and do it in the open.

237
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:36,329
Start sharing it right away, or build
your dream product and then share it.

238
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:39,509
Obviously you wanna bring the users
along with you as much as you can,

239
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:44,079
as early as you can, but I. Don't be
afraid to build something just 'cause

240
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,879
there's already a version of that.

241
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:50,024
I, my least favorite thing that
people say to me about, but

242
00:13:50,084 --> 00:13:51,374
this tool already does that.

243
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:51,824
Yeah.

244
00:13:51,824 --> 00:13:53,744
But it doesn't fit for my needs.

245
00:13:53,954 --> 00:13:54,764
And that's okay.

246
00:13:55,324 --> 00:13:58,264
they're gonna want competition
'cause it opens up their market.

247
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:02,054
So we want to, we wanna
focus on innovation.

248
00:14:02,054 --> 00:14:03,794
We wanna focus on getting things better.

249
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:07,334
That means going ahead and building
some that better mousetrap.

250
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:13,084
You said opposite example of someone
who built something very privately, a

251
00:14:13,294 --> 00:14:15,904
potentially very innovative product.

252
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:21,474
but everything was hidden from the
users and it was difficult for every,

253
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:23,359
everyone involved to understand.

254
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,984
'cause there was no transparency.

255
00:14:25,414 --> 00:14:27,634
So Theranos a very.

256
00:14:27,874 --> 00:14:31,984
Famous story for most people in the
startup world, really in any product

257
00:14:31,984 --> 00:14:36,574
world, was built behind closed doors,
hiding things from investors because

258
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:39,514
they weren't making the progress that
they thought they would, trying to keep

259
00:14:39,514 --> 00:14:41,404
it proprietary everywhere they could.

260
00:14:41,794 --> 00:14:46,154
And using the old fake it till you
make it approach, which in the end.

261
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,404
Really came back to bite them.

262
00:14:48,444 --> 00:14:52,704
So transparency would've helped a
lot from the very beginning, right?

263
00:14:52,704 --> 00:14:54,054
Building something from the start.

264
00:14:54,624 --> 00:14:55,854
Who knows where they could be?

265
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:56,124
Now?

266
00:14:56,124 --> 00:14:59,724
now, I don't know if they, I obviously
was not involved in this, but I don't

267
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:04,314
know if they had a better product
in mind and it just didn't come

268
00:15:04,314 --> 00:15:05,904
through or the idea was to fake it.

269
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:06,924
But I don't think so.

270
00:15:06,924 --> 00:15:11,754
I think they were trying to build
something truly revolutionary and it just.

271
00:15:12,429 --> 00:15:17,999
One person had too much control,
hid things, and was just not

272
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:19,499
able to make it happen, right?

273
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:22,649
So lesson learned, hopefully
for a lot of people.

274
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:26,349
so let's talk about the
radical process, right?

275
00:15:26,349 --> 00:15:30,199
So we know Agile, scrum, lean,
all of these different, tools.

276
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:33,629
and they work great for a
lot of different situations.

277
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:34,359
but I think.

278
00:15:34,914 --> 00:15:38,854
In a cloud native environment,
there's some things that

279
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:39,904
are missing in that, right?

280
00:15:40,404 --> 00:15:43,804
I think, one of the things that
we wanna focus on in our process

281
00:15:43,804 --> 00:15:47,704
is building trust with the product
team and the development team.

282
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:51,614
agile tins and Scrum tends
to separate you out, right?

283
00:15:51,614 --> 00:15:54,584
You've got the pigs and the
chickens and all the different

284
00:15:54,584 --> 00:15:55,754
things that they talk about there.

285
00:15:56,264 --> 00:15:58,814
And the reality is we're all
coming, need to come together

286
00:15:58,814 --> 00:16:00,584
to build that product, right?

287
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:03,704
But not everybody needs access
to everything all the time.

288
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,979
But they do need some sort of
idea of what's going on, how

289
00:16:07,979 --> 00:16:09,119
to work with that product.

290
00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:13,084
They want to be able to ha put their
voice into it, but they want, they

291
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:15,959
wanna feel like it's constructive
and they're not interrupting.

292
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:21,959
So clear communication, bringing the
process back to the development cycles,

293
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:26,399
but also bringing it back to the product
management cycles, the marketing cycles,

294
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:29,909
the design cycles, all of that into one.

295
00:16:30,734 --> 00:16:32,144
Radical process, right?

296
00:16:32,144 --> 00:16:34,974
Where we're building
everything from the start.

297
00:16:35,034 --> 00:16:38,874
We're not building artifacts, we're
not building documentation necessarily.

298
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:44,064
We're building a product that means
stakeholders are included from the

299
00:16:44,064 --> 00:16:47,064
beginning, and that's developers
are stakeholders too, right?

300
00:16:47,154 --> 00:16:52,764
Product managers are stakeholders, as
is management, and C-E-O-C-F-O, all

301
00:16:52,764 --> 00:16:54,559
of those people, especially marketing.

302
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:57,579
Need to be involved in at certain steps.

303
00:16:57,849 --> 00:17:01,749
So the more clear you are, the more
open you are from the very beginning,

304
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:03,189
the easier it is to bring them in.

305
00:17:03,739 --> 00:17:07,219
aligning your team across all of
these different silos helps to

306
00:17:07,219 --> 00:17:09,229
remove those silos when you need it.

307
00:17:09,874 --> 00:17:13,624
And then bringing that feedback
in, right Surveys, bringing in

308
00:17:13,624 --> 00:17:18,444
through, process tools, bringing in
through direct demo days, so that

309
00:17:18,444 --> 00:17:20,214
you can actually show progress.

310
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:24,244
and when you make a mistake,
be open about it, right?

311
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,444
And let people know.

312
00:17:25,774 --> 00:17:29,344
'cause the worst thing that can
happen is there's a mistake out there.

313
00:17:29,524 --> 00:17:33,579
There's a bug that brings
down part of your application.

314
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:35,139
Hopefully just part of it, not all of it.

315
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:36,069
and.

316
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:40,239
You didn't tell anybody and they
find it, it's much easier if

317
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:41,379
they know ahead of time, right?

318
00:17:41,379 --> 00:17:42,039
It's hard.

319
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,684
It's a hard lesson to learn, but that's.

320
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,144
The best thing you can do.

321
00:17:45,684 --> 00:17:50,184
And then when you do make that fix and you
do get that first release out, celebrate

322
00:17:50,184 --> 00:17:52,794
that with your team, with your users.

323
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:57,934
again, don't be a cheerleader, but
just, acknowledge those wins because

324
00:17:57,984 --> 00:18:02,114
they're sometimes few and far between,
but you still wanna be able to show

325
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:06,794
that the team's making progress, So
it's not about the tools necessarily,

326
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:12,514
but it is also about the tools, And for
us, building labs where we do product

327
00:18:12,514 --> 00:18:16,924
management and communication, that our
whole process is about removing those

328
00:18:16,924 --> 00:18:21,754
silos and letting people in without
having to directly connect them.

329
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:24,619
So one of my least favorite.

330
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:29,959
Problems is when a CEO has access
directly to a developer, right?

331
00:18:30,469 --> 00:18:34,219
Or a developer is asking
questions of a product manager.

332
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:39,289
They don't know how to answer that, and
so they go to the CEO or the manager and

333
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:41,299
have them talk directly to the developer.

334
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:45,309
that can be distracting for everyone
involved, and nobody wants to be involved

335
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:48,879
at that level necessarily when they're
thinking about high level things.

336
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:54,369
So bringing, breaking down those
silos, sharing code from the very

337
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:57,279
beginning again, like we talked about,
and then communicate through Slack

338
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,809
or whatever tool you like, but making
sure that is updated consistently

339
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,399
and everybody has access to it.

340
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:09,319
Now bringing philosophies and politics
and everything else into a, an

341
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:11,419
organization is not a good idea usually.

342
00:19:11,469 --> 00:19:16,589
But I think when you're talking about
finding the team that fits best, right?

343
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:21,569
And openly communicating, like some of
that is about stakeholder inclusion, but

344
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:26,189
it, some of it's also about transparency
and why are you involved in bringing that,

345
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:27,979
that up right from the very beginning.

346
00:19:27,979 --> 00:19:29,329
So open communication.

347
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:31,219
Builds trust, right?

348
00:19:31,219 --> 00:19:32,569
With customers and your team.

349
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:36,589
Transparency tends to attract
like-minded individuals, people

350
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:41,149
that also like transparency and it
brings loyalty to your employees.

351
00:19:41,689 --> 00:19:45,559
I think you, loyalty can
be a bad word for sure.

352
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:50,124
I. You don't like, but what you do
want to have is people that want

353
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:53,364
to see that product succeed, want
to see your organization succeed,

354
00:19:53,784 --> 00:19:55,944
including them from the very beginning.

355
00:19:56,484 --> 00:19:57,774
That's how that happens, right?

356
00:19:57,774 --> 00:20:02,224
So start small, really gradually
scale up your transparency efforts.

357
00:20:02,694 --> 00:20:07,224
but don't be afraid to bring it to your
organization, whatever that size it is,

358
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:09,654
and start to get buyout from the top down.

359
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:14,649
open build is a product and
a organization that's really.

360
00:20:14,989 --> 00:20:19,519
dear to me in terms of its approach
to open source, helping open source,

361
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:22,529
as well as helping developers learn.

362
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:26,499
So it's a thing that's missing a lot in
organizations right now is, mentorship.

363
00:20:26,649 --> 00:20:29,844
So open build is a place to
do that if you're interested.

364
00:20:30,214 --> 00:20:33,454
again, check out the GitHub
repository, come back and talk to us.

365
00:20:33,874 --> 00:20:35,584
we're expanding quickly with that.

366
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:38,614
We've got a lot of different developers
going through that process, and

367
00:20:38,614 --> 00:20:39,604
we're always looking for more.

368
00:20:40,104 --> 00:20:44,474
the Product Foundry again, build Lee
is focused on all of the ideas that

369
00:20:44,474 --> 00:20:46,694
are inside of the Radical Therapy book.

370
00:20:47,064 --> 00:20:51,244
but it's also partly, built
around a process that's

371
00:20:51,304 --> 00:20:52,984
documented in that book as well.

372
00:20:53,354 --> 00:20:57,404
if you're interested in learning more
about Build and our Foundry program for

373
00:20:57,404 --> 00:21:02,594
startups as well as just products in
small, who wants to learn more, and, yeah.

374
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,944
Thank you very much for listening.
