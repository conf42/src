00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,790
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,300
I am Abdul Hamid Mohamad, a certified
software engineer with over nine years

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,870
of experience in full stack development,
IoT integration, and cloud technologies.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,099
I have worked with major enterprises
like 7 Eleven, Deloitte, and

5
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:19,069
Resoltech, helping business modernize
their back end architecture and

6
00:00:19,069 --> 00:00:21,009
scale application efficiently.

7
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:24,119
Today we will discuss microservices.

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,400
So let's proceed.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,709
Have you ever struggled with scaling
applications, deploying features,

10
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:34,300
faster or maintaining system stability?

11
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:35,600
Imagine deploying updates every 11.

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,560
7 seconds, just like Amazon and Google.

13
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:44,669
That's the power of microservices
and today I'll show you how they are

14
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:47,050
revolutionizing modern web development.

15
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,845
In this presentation, we will explore
why microservices are replacing

16
00:00:51,855 --> 00:00:56,995
monolithic architecture, the real world
benefits of microservice adoption,

17
00:00:57,315 --> 00:01:02,485
how organizations can transition
successfully to microservices.

18
00:01:02,835 --> 00:01:06,005
Let's dive in the rise of microservices.

19
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:11,085
The shift to cloud native architectures
is now the industry standard.

20
00:01:11,735 --> 00:01:17,905
84 percent of enterprises have already
embraced cloud native architectures.

21
00:01:18,165 --> 00:01:23,175
Making a fundamental shift in how
applications are built and deployed.

22
00:01:23,565 --> 00:01:29,505
Since 2020, microservices adoption has
surged by 50 percent year over year.

23
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:32,225
Netflix is a prime example.

24
00:01:32,965 --> 00:01:39,695
Running over 900 microservices to deliver
167 million streaming hours daily.

25
00:01:39,895 --> 00:01:45,345
That's equivalent to 19, 000
years of content watched.

26
00:01:45,845 --> 00:01:49,665
So why are companies adopting
microservices at this scale?

27
00:01:50,065 --> 00:01:52,495
Let's explore their agility and speed.

28
00:01:52,995 --> 00:01:58,155
Organizations that transition to
microservices experience massive

29
00:01:58,205 --> 00:02:03,275
improvements in development
agility and deployment speed.

00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:18,060
23 times more frequent deployments
shifting from monthly releases to

33
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:25,320
multiple daily updates, 65 percent of
reduction in production failures, thanks

34
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,630
to fault isolation and best better
system resilience with microservices

35
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:36,340
businesses can experiment, innovate,
and adapt faster without being

36
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,120
considered by monolithic bottlenecks.

37
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,470
Core principles of microservices.

38
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,480
What makes microservices so powerful?

39
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:50,950
They rely on three core components,
resilience and recovery organizing report,

40
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,530
a 92 percent improvement in meantime to
recovery, reducing downtime and enabling

41
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:04,360
faster issue resolution, faster deployment
cycles, team achieve 75 percent shorter.

42
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,640
development cycle allowing parallel
deployment of independent services,

43
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,540
continuous integration and deployment.

44
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:19,570
CICD microservices support modern DevOps
pipeline ensuring automated testing,

45
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,250
faster deployments and smoother rollout.

46
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,020
The result, more action and
better customer experience.

47
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,240
the speed of updates.

48
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,770
Companies like Amazon and Google are
setting a new standard for deployment.

49
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,789
Every 11.

50
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:39,730
7 seconds, a new code update is deployed.

51
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,530
No scheduled maintenance windows,
just continuous improvements.

52
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,210
Critical security patches and new future,
new features are rolled out instantly.

53
00:03:50,365 --> 00:03:55,165
This shift means business can stay
ahead of security risk and deliver

54
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:57,715
new feature faster than ever before.

55
00:03:58,215 --> 00:04:00,955
Now discuss the benefits of microservices.

56
00:04:01,335 --> 00:04:04,935
Microservices unlock three key benefits.

57
00:04:05,435 --> 00:04:07,245
Scalability, maintainability.

58
00:04:07,775 --> 00:04:13,905
71 percent of enterprises handle
More than 100, 000 concurrent users

59
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:17,075
with reduced cloud cost by 30%.

60
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:22,045
Teams can scale individual
services independently, eliminating

61
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:22,695
performance bottlenecks.

62
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:30,795
Maintainability 68 percent of developers
report 75 percent faster update cycles.

63
00:04:31,665 --> 00:04:36,605
Bug fixes are deployed 37 minutes
after discovery instead of 24

64
00:04:36,655 --> 00:04:38,925
hours delays in monolithic system.

65
00:04:39,825 --> 00:04:43,925
Microservices are not just a
technology trend, but they are

66
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:46,235
business enabler adoption rate.

67
00:04:46,565 --> 00:04:50,705
Microservices are the future of
modern application development.

68
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:56,155
63 percent of enterprises have already
deployed microservices in production.

69
00:04:56,745 --> 00:05:01,185
29 percent are actively planning
adoption within the next year.

70
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:07,720
Only 8 percent of organizations
remain undecided with 92 percent of

71
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,180
businesses enabling microservices.

72
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,690
Their transformation is unstoppable.

73
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,950
So let's discuss how you can
transform your architecture,

74
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,810
how you can use a microservices.

75
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:26,230
There are three basic simple steps,
conduct a throw architecture audit,

76
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:32,390
identify bottlenecks and dependencies,
establish clear performance benchmark.

77
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,940
In your plan, design resilient
microservice aligned with business

78
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:43,190
goals, define microservice boundaries
and API contracts, develop a

79
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,400
strategy with risk migration plan.

80
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,880
Implementation.

81
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,000
Start by transforming low
risk, high impact service.

82
00:05:51,535 --> 00:05:56,555
Implement monitoring, automated
testing, and CICD pipelines.

83
00:05:57,305 --> 00:06:01,575
Optimize performance with real
time feedback and iteration.

84
00:06:02,075 --> 00:06:07,005
Now, let's go with real world
case study, e commerce platform.

85
00:06:07,505 --> 00:06:11,485
Here is how one e commerce
platform transform its

86
00:06:11,815 --> 00:06:14,065
performance using microservices.

87
00:06:14,255 --> 00:06:21,045
Before microservices, 48 hour deployment
cycle with frequent system wide outages.

88
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,630
could handle only 1, 000 concurrent
users with 3 second page load time.

89
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,560
8 hours of monthly downtime
due to full system updates.

90
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,020
After microservices, deployment
time reduced to 15 minutes

91
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,070
with 0 downtime updates.

92
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,340
Platform now supports 50, 000
plus concurrent users with 200

93
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,320
millisecond page load time.

94
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:50,745
99.99% uptime with three
time faster feature delivery.

95
00:06:51,155 --> 00:06:54,735
The result, faster
innovation, better user.

96
00:06:55,605 --> 00:07:01,275
Our key takeaways microservice provide
three game changing advantages, agility,

97
00:07:01,365 --> 00:07:03,375
scalability, and maintainability.

98
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,735
