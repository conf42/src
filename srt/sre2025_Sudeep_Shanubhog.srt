Performance, improve improvements and
vision of what's next in this space.

9
00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:34,125
Let's see how it works.

10
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:38,055
Imagine you are having a senior
full stack developer with over 10

11
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:42,405
years of experience in Microsoft
Technologies, someone proficient in

12
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:47,295
T net Core, angular, or React, and
databases like SQ Server or MongoDB.

13
00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:52,785
Searching manually through thousands
of profile on job portals can be

14
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:54,555
overwhelming and time consuming.

15
00:00:55,695 --> 00:01:00,375
So now picture how AI driven equipment
system that transform this process.

16
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:10,150
First, the profile filtering the AI
scans thousands of resumes extracting not

17
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,850
just keywords, but contextual insights.

Automated skill assessment.

29
00:01:58,165 --> 00:02:02,395
If the AI determines a strong match,
it automatically sends a personalized

30
00:02:02,395 --> 00:02:07,195
skill assessment to the candidate
via email id, tailored to their

31
00:02:07,615 --> 00:02:09,414
experience and job requirements.

32
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:14,205
Four realtime scoring and introduc.

00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:50,425
Final selection and letter.

41
00:02:51,385 --> 00:02:52,225
This is the final step.

42
00:02:52,975 --> 00:02:56,365
Once all interviews are complete,
the system sends an automated email

43
00:02:56,365 --> 00:02:58,195
informing the candidate of the outcome.

44
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:03,115
If selected, the candidate receives
the o. Along with the company's

45
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:06,925
