00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,630
Hello everyone and thank you for joining.

2
00:00:02,989 --> 00:00:07,729
Today I will be talking about platform
engineering for data science at scale.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,500
Over the past decade, data
science has evolved dramatically.

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:17,180
What started as individuals
analyzing spreadsheets has now

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,940
become enterprise wide AI projects.

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,010
These projects need sophisticated
and infrastructure and scalable

7
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,890
computing and reliable deployment pipe.

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,730
But here is the challenge.

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:36,450
Many organizations invest heavily
in tools and talent, yet still

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,090
struggle to move machine learning from
experiments into real business systems.

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,620
That's where platform engineering
plays a critical role.

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,840
Slide two.

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:55,340
The problem isn't usually the algorithms
or the data, it's the infrastructure.

14
00:00:55,985 --> 00:01:00,455
Traditional approaches often
create three main issues.

15
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:03,875
First, fragmented tool genes.

16
00:01:04,235 --> 00:01:09,370
Different team use different tools,
which makes integration very difficult.

17
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:12,530
Second inconsistent environments.

18
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,929
The classic works on my machine
problem where models fail

19
00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:20,010
once moved into production.

20
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,610
Third, deployment bottlenecks.

21
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,460
Data scientists build models,
but engineering teams struggle

22
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,050
to operationalize them.

23
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:35,140
Platform engineering solves this by
providing a centralized, scalable, and a

24
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:42,190
standardized foundation so data scientists
can focus on innovation, not firefighting.

25
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:49,279
Moving on, let's look closer at the main
challenges environment, inconsistency.

26
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:54,169
Models behave differently in
development versus in production.

27
00:01:54,669 --> 00:01:55,869
Tool fragmentation.

28
00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:00,309
Too many tools lead to silos
and maintenance, headaches,

29
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:02,830
resource inefficiency.

30
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:06,729
Sometimes too much
computing power is wasted.

31
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:09,430
Sometimes not enough is available.

32
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,060
Fourth, deployment complexity.

33
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,149
Putting a model into production
takes too much manual work.

34
00:02:16,649 --> 00:02:21,869
Fifth, security and compliance
risk Patchwork solutions make

35
00:02:21,869 --> 00:02:23,669
it hard to stay compliant.

36
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,229
These challenges slow down
progress and raise costs.

37
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:31,519
So how does platform engineering help?

38
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:34,939
It follows a few key principles.

39
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:40,189
Obstruction, hide the messy infrastructure
details, so data scientists can

40
00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:42,829
focus on their work self service.

41
00:02:43,384 --> 00:02:48,514
Let teams provision environments and
deploy models without waiting for it.

42
00:02:49,474 --> 00:02:54,664
Standardization, ensure everyone
follows the same patterns and tools.

43
00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:59,899
Observability, monitor model
behaviors, data quality, and

44
00:02:59,899 --> 00:03:01,879
performance at all times.

45
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:07,549
Scalability, make sure the
system grows and demands grows.

46
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:09,789
Security by design.

47
00:03:10,195 --> 00:03:15,564
Build security into the platform from
the start, not after the thought.

48
00:03:16,064 --> 00:03:22,714
Most of the most important foundation
is containerization, containerizations.

49
00:03:22,714 --> 00:03:28,805
Make sure models run consistently
across environments, avoid conflicts

50
00:03:28,984 --> 00:03:33,785
and even allow multiple versions
of a model to run at the same time.

51
00:03:34,655 --> 00:03:36,280
Then comes microservices.

52
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:43,999
Breaking big monolithic systems into
smaller focus services like data

53
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:47,149
integration, model training or monitoring.

54
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:53,140
Each can be scaled independently
together with or orchestration

55
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,390
and service mesh technologies.

56
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,405
This makes platforms more
flexible and easier to manage

57
00:03:59,905 --> 00:04:01,004
in cloud environment.

58
00:04:01,554 --> 00:04:05,695
Certain design patterns make
platform reliable and efficient.

59
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:12,205
12 factor methodology, a framework for
scalable maintainable applications.

60
00:04:12,595 --> 00:04:16,735
Even driven architecture
triggers training or scalable

61
00:04:16,945 --> 00:04:19,644
automatically when new data arrives.

62
00:04:20,274 --> 00:04:26,245
Immutable infrastructure, every change
creates a new version making rollbacks

63
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:29,600
very safe, circuit breakers and bulk.

64
00:04:30,549 --> 00:04:35,620
Protect against cascading failures
and keep workloads isolated.

65
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,359
Autoscaling expand or shrink resources
based on demand saving costs.

66
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:49,129
Machine learning pipelines are the most
likely to assemble line of data science.

67
00:04:49,609 --> 00:04:56,114
They like raw data, transform it, train
models, validate them, and deploy results.

68
00:04:56,614 --> 00:05:01,894
A strong pipeline provides
orchestration to manage dependencies

69
00:05:01,894 --> 00:05:07,324
and scheduling data, lineage and
versioning to track every step and

70
00:05:07,324 --> 00:05:13,150
ensure reproducibility fault tolerance
to recover gracefully from failures.

71
00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:17,949
Good pipelines also integrates
smoothly with enterprise

72
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:19,989
systems and optimized resource.

73
00:05:20,489 --> 00:05:24,359
A data science platform
must serve many groups.

74
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,150
Data scientists need quick
experimentation and easy access to data.

75
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:35,489
ML engineers, they need reliable
deployment and monitoring tools.

76
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:41,340
Platform engineers need visibility
into performance, cost, and compliance.

77
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:46,679
Security team needs strong control
without slowing others down.

78
00:05:47,624 --> 00:05:50,744
Business stakeholders need to see results.

79
00:05:50,775 --> 00:05:54,104
Metrics like performance speed and ROI.

80
00:05:54,854 --> 00:06:00,344
Balancing all of these needs is what
makes a platform truly successful.

81
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:06,424
Monitoring is the heartbeat of platform
engineering, the monitor infrastructure,

82
00:06:07,414 --> 00:06:10,369
server storage, networking application.

83
00:06:11,164 --> 00:06:15,424
They monitor latency,
throughput, error rates, data.

84
00:06:16,024 --> 00:06:22,054
In that we monitor freshness,
quality schema, compliance models.

85
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:26,104
What is monitored is
accuracy, drift and anomalies.

86
00:06:26,584 --> 00:06:31,715
With this data, we optimize performance
and set up alerts so issues are

87
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:34,174
fixed before they impact users.

88
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:37,074
The future of platforms is exciting.

89
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:41,859
Edge computing brings model
closers to where data is generated.

90
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,719
Automated ML reduces manual
work in model building.

91
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,969
Federated learning trains models
across different data sources

92
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:53,799
without moving sensitive data.

93
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,719
Multi-cloud strategies improves
resilience and flexibility.

94
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:02,200
Sustainability is becoming essential.

95
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:06,370
Building platforms that are efficient
and environmentally friendly.

96
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,300
Platform engineering changes the game.

97
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,060
It can triple productivity.

98
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,960
Since data scientists are no
longer required to deal with

99
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,420
infrastructure headaches, it can
cut deployment time in half, moving

100
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,550
models faster into production.

101
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:30,300
It can double the innovation because
teams share knowledge more easily and it

102
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,170
can reduce infrastructure costs by 40%.

103
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:40,499
Through efficient resources, it's a
real shift from fragmented systems

104
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:43,140
to a streamlined, scalable platform.

105
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,170
The key benefits, the benefits
are both technical and strategic.

106
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:53,594
Democratization making advanced
tools available to more people.

107
00:07:54,314 --> 00:07:57,390
Reliability, reducing risk in production.

108
00:07:57,789 --> 00:07:58,189
ML system.

109
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:04,455
Collaboration, helping teams share models
and insights instead of duplicating

110
00:08:04,455 --> 00:08:12,015
work cost optimization, using resources
more wisely, future ready, being able

111
00:08:12,015 --> 00:08:14,625
to adapt quickly to new technologies.

112
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,835
The implementation roadmap.

113
00:08:17,284 --> 00:08:20,015
So how do we actually build this?

114
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:21,215
Here is the roadmap.

115
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,549
Assessment.

116
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:25,049
Identify pain points and a plan.

117
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:30,860
Foundation, build core components
like containers and orchestration,

118
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,600
platform development, create
workflows and self-service

119
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,820
tools, operational excellence,
add monitoring and optimization.

120
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:46,430
Continuous evolution keep improving
with feedback and new technology.

121
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,165
To wrap up platform engineering
is more than a technical fix.

122
00:08:52,015 --> 00:08:53,935
It's a strategic investment.

123
00:08:54,505 --> 00:09:00,385
Yes, it takes planning and commitment,
but the payoff is huge, scalable,

124
00:09:00,685 --> 00:09:06,745
reliable, and efficient platforms that
give companies a real competitive edge.

125
00:09:06,775 --> 00:09:14,125
In an AI driven world, the organizations
that embrace this will move faster,

126
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:17,635
adapt better, and ultimately win.

127
00:09:18,135 --> 00:09:19,205
Thank you for listening.

128
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,240
I would be happy to answer any
other questions that anyone has.
