1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,470
Speaker 50: Hey everyone.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,880
I'm Vlad a software engineer
with over 11 years of experience.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,620
And last few years I was working
mostly as a platform engineer and as

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,129
an observability engineer, helping
teams to observe their systems.

5
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:19,600
And today we're going to talk a little
bit about AI agents for incident

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,919
response and different parts of that
side, like the good, the bad, the ugly.

7
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:28,529
So let's start and let's
start with a good part.

8
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:33,879
Modern ai, like it's
growing with a huge speed.

9
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:41,199
So like few years, like no one even
knew it exists and it'll grow like that.

10
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:42,039
But yeah.

11
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:47,989
Since people start seeing like great
value and integrating it into like their

12
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:53,259
process as companies, yeah, they see the
value and they do it like fast and fast.

13
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:55,209
And AI itself is also.

14
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:03,259
Growing really fast and many observability
platforms, tags, they start also

15
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:09,649
using ai, creating like AI agents
inside integrating AI in their flows.

16
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,859
And yeah, it happen everywhere.

17
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:17,799
So it's like for commercial stock, like a
data dock incident, AI pager duty agents.

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,789
Honeycomb, MCP and like New Relic AIOps.

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:29,690
And it also helps in open source when
you just get this open source platform.

20
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:34,400
Like you commonly use I don't
know, Lockkey tempo or a

21
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,690
LK stack or anything else.

22
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,690
And you can connect your AI agent.

23
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:47,839
Like whatever it is, like clo cursor,
like custom agent Codex or you

24
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:49,699
can use like also cloud solutions.

25
00:01:49,699 --> 00:01:53,749
They also provide their agents
like Grafana one for example.

26
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:59,179
And it happened really fast
and with high impact usually.

27
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,029
And we can see that like over 62.

28
00:02:03,675 --> 00:02:07,794
Percent of organizations started
implementing of different AI

29
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,624
agents half of them running pilots.

30
00:02:10,624 --> 00:02:12,604
And yeah, it's a growing trend.

31
00:02:12,604 --> 00:02:14,909
So like few years ago, no
one even thought about that.

32
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:20,140
And why it is helpful and why people
start even thinking about that.

33
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:26,539
One of first think of okay, if you are
sitting and working and like you get like

34
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:32,289
your lots of like slack washing or some
kind of alerts or need some investigation.

35
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:35,919
I don't know, like databases
slow or like some services

36
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,109
down or like jobs are failing.

37
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:45,909
So usually like we have some kind of
like common process to investigate.

38
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:51,154
It could be like rely on alert itself
on our stacks that we use, kind.

39
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:56,359
Knowledge that we know about the system
knowledge of other people about business

40
00:02:56,359 --> 00:03:01,519
or anything like how system works and
how it's supposed to work, and general

41
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,609
knowledge about okay, how this tool works.

42
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:09,869
And yeah, usually you got like some
kind of if we talk about alerts, let's

43
00:03:09,869 --> 00:03:15,599
say something is wrong, you most likely
have to and want to have some kind of

44
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,234
alerting for that, and you get alert.

45
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:22,389
You sometimes have, sometimes
you just know what to do,

46
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,159
like some kind of playbook.

47
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:26,649
So what to do in this case.

48
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:32,379
And after that you need to gather
information like what actually happening

49
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,289
potentially, like from multiple systems.

50
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:36,939
Correlate together.

51
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:39,909
So it means okay, here I
have this piece of data.

52
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:41,139
Here I see logs.

53
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:43,269
Okay, the service is failing.

54
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:47,659
And I see like in metrics, CPU
is high and something like that.

55
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:52,879
Or like memory is high and
yeah, you can provide a fix.

56
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:55,369
So okay, we just need to increase memory.

57
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:55,609
I don't.

58
00:03:56,274 --> 00:03:56,904
Something like that.

59
00:03:57,354 --> 00:04:00,974
But what if in this
flow we just inject ai?

60
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:05,174
So usually each of those
tab take some time.

61
00:04:05,594 --> 00:04:05,834
Okay.

62
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:09,069
We need to understand the context,
check, what to do if we don't.

63
00:04:09,804 --> 00:04:10,674
We are not sure.

64
00:04:10,674 --> 00:04:12,414
We don't remember anything like that.

65
00:04:12,714 --> 00:04:15,924
Gather all the information,
understand what happening and fix it.

66
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:21,974
But yeah, if we allow AI to do
those, like kind of initial analysis

67
00:04:21,974 --> 00:04:25,484
and like correlation and gathering
all the data and providing us in

68
00:04:25,484 --> 00:04:28,224
like simple format like we can.

69
00:04:28,724 --> 00:04:32,924
Skyrocket our speech to like
investigation and fixing problems.

70
00:04:33,114 --> 00:04:38,764
And if we talk about like minor incident
in it can free engineering time to

71
00:04:38,764 --> 00:04:42,334
spend for something more important and
like just reaction to some kind of.

72
00:04:42,904 --> 00:04:48,004
Alerts I don't know, sometimes can be
noisy, but yeah, whatever can happen.

73
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:53,094
And in case of some kind of measure
outages to faster gathers information

74
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:59,664
assume some fixes, understand potential
core reasons, and save company more money

75
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:04,434
because like usually like high incidents,
it means like business doesn't operate as

76
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:07,874
expected and it can result as money loss.

77
00:05:08,454 --> 00:05:08,754
Yeah.

78
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:14,564
In this case it's mostly you can
save lots of time on gathering the

79
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:20,864
data and improve your like option
to response to this incident.

80
00:05:21,314 --> 00:05:25,884
And usually how it's done
particularly I saw it many companies.

81
00:05:25,884 --> 00:05:27,864
So you have your AI.

82
00:05:28,734 --> 00:05:33,804
Like agent, it could be like custom
agent or like many companies I've

83
00:05:33,804 --> 00:05:39,744
used personally a lot like CLO code
or Cursor agent or some use Codex.

84
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:45,214
I wrote also some kind of smaller
agents like custom ones for part.

85
00:05:46,024 --> 00:05:50,704
Like use cases, but usually you need
to connect your AI to like different

86
00:05:50,704 --> 00:05:53,134
systems because AI itself, okay.

87
00:05:53,284 --> 00:05:54,834
It'll be like child GT itself.

88
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:55,044
Okay.

89
00:05:55,044 --> 00:06:01,054
It can research some information, help
you with understanding some kind of how

90
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:06,334
particular system works or like what
problems what solution to the problem.

91
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:13,299
Can be applied, but to make it more
like autonomous and powerful you usually

92
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:15,219
want to connect it to your systems.

93
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:20,869
And for this just two years ago, you
usually wrote your like, tools, how to

94
00:06:20,869 --> 00:06:26,989
connect to that particular API and like
lots of people did it in different ways.

95
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,799
And like they wrote their
own codes, but a year.

96
00:06:30,294 --> 00:06:34,464
A little bit more than a year ago, a
period like such, think as an MCP and

97
00:06:34,464 --> 00:06:36,024
like it's model context, protocol.

98
00:06:36,024 --> 00:06:40,384
And it's started standardization how
AI can connect to external systems

99
00:06:40,594 --> 00:06:46,504
and lots of like platforms for
observability, including open source.

100
00:06:46,664 --> 00:06:52,924
Like for they allow to connect their
AI agent with such MCP servers.

101
00:06:53,294 --> 00:06:54,319
To the platform.

102
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:58,699
So for example, you can connect
to your Slack and search for I

103
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:01,879
don't know, a similar discussions
that happened like a year ago.

104
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:07,669
Similar incident or like to Jira
to see what was the ticket and why

105
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:12,289
potentially could fail after deployment
or Datadog with lot, lots of information

106
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:16,854
there about, telemetry data like
Confluence as a knowledge source.

107
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:21,354
Also, Grafana has lots of telemetry data,
honeycomb, elastic search like PagerDuty

108
00:07:21,684 --> 00:07:26,804
to understand page itself or GitHub to
have the success to caught and see what

109
00:07:26,804 --> 00:07:29,024
actually can fail if it's like a service.

110
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:30,824
So lots of.

111
00:07:31,544 --> 00:07:33,224
Impact, lots of speed up.

112
00:07:33,644 --> 00:07:37,994
AI agent can really great gather
all the information, analyze it,

113
00:07:37,994 --> 00:07:39,764
and provide you with some solution.

114
00:07:40,214 --> 00:07:46,594
But yeah, that's a great part about AI
with great parts can go also a bad part.

115
00:07:47,144 --> 00:07:53,344
When you start implementing it, it's
great, it's fun until it is not so it.

116
00:07:54,114 --> 00:07:55,944
Not always work as you expected.

117
00:07:56,604 --> 00:08:02,784
So one of the big problems
is like it can go as deep as.

118
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,780
F It can sometimes, and you need to
limit it because like you can get into a

119
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:12,299
rabbit hole when it's always try to get
data, analyze it, try to get more and

120
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:16,939
analyze it, and try to get more and try
to fix something, or try to do something.

121
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:22,390
And that potentially can go into probably
not infin, but almost infinite loop.

122
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,690
And they try to change
crash, change, doesn't work.

123
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,890
And yeah, it can get stuck
analyzing strange things.

124
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:36,760
Of course, like you need to have a great
foundation to inject AI because as a

125
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,070
popular phrase, garbage in, garbage out.

126
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,180
It means like you have to provide.

127
00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:45,675
A great data for your AI agent.

128
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:50,435
So it can understand, okay,
I understand how to get the

129
00:08:50,435 --> 00:08:53,025
data I got from the systems.

130
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:57,585
I can analyze it and based on that
analysis, I can provide some kind of

131
00:08:57,795 --> 00:09:03,225
like summary and what to do next because
yeah, without that, if you don't have

132
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:07,525
like good alert and good telemetry
collection, good, access to that data.

133
00:09:07,885 --> 00:09:13,965
Yeah, it's most likely won't work
because if you cannot use that

134
00:09:14,465 --> 00:09:17,075
AI probably also won't use it.

135
00:09:17,675 --> 00:09:22,215
Also it's important to
understand like what and explain

136
00:09:22,215 --> 00:09:23,355
it and what they should do.

137
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,280
And usually as your system grows,
also like context of your system and

138
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,080
knowledge about your system grows.

139
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:36,640
And like you have like tools for
login, for metrics, for tracing,

140
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,500
for some kind of knowledge.

141
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:45,140
You have your code, you have I don't
know your like, workflows and jobs and

142
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:52,900
everything like AI cannot know everything
without training extras that you,

143
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,530
companies don't usually rely on that.

144
00:09:55,530 --> 00:10:01,650
So you need to provide a good
context on how your system works and

145
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,760
how it can analyze what happened.

146
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:08,140
And, best practice is usually
like to sculpt your agent to some

147
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:13,070
particular scope of work and do more
a swarm of agents or like cruise.

148
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,610
And it's, it works much better because it
can focus on one particular thing, analyze

149
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,860
logs and collect that and gather metrics.

150
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,330
Gather like some kind of.

151
00:10:24,885 --> 00:10:29,845
Event that happened, and after that
some analytical agent can, okay I

152
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:34,875
know how to analyze this data and
based on this playbook and also

153
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:39,775
data I collected, and you have an
orchestrator that can like orchestrate.

154
00:10:40,275 --> 00:10:45,205
So for example, if you use like CLO code,
it usually can be like multiple agents.

155
00:10:45,595 --> 00:10:51,265
Underlines it, execute your query, and
yeah, without that, like you can face

156
00:10:51,265 --> 00:10:57,385
like lots of contexts lower quality
of responses, and yeah, it can just

157
00:10:57,485 --> 00:11:00,635
start providing you with strange data.

158
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:06,485
And also like with when agents face
something unknown, like failures that.

159
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,720
And it doesn't know how to do.

160
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,840
Of course there are like lots of like
public information and it's great that

161
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,350
AI can understand that and provide
you a solution, but like such kind of

162
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:21,710
uncontrolled creativity and also not
always great because it can as provide

163
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,390
you with some kind of good solution.

164
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,600
Also, it can provide you with
a bad solution with a mass.

165
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:32,660
And you start collecting those like errors
and problems with times that can cause

166
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,390
much bigger problems like an incident.

167
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,840
With such things it had to be
reviewed and being under control and.

168
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:47,795
Explained, and of course one I think
we mentioned like we want to put

169
00:11:47,795 --> 00:11:51,585
like to our agent as many information
as much information as possible.

170
00:11:51,915 --> 00:11:57,850
But the problems that our AI agent is like
with limited context, even some million.

171
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,090
Tokens that some model provides.

172
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,800
It's sometimes not enough.

173
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,650
So you need to manage the context, okay?

174
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,945
Like your logs can be like,
utilized of data and you cannot

175
00:12:09,945 --> 00:12:12,535
just use that as is an AI agent.

176
00:12:12,535 --> 00:12:15,985
And you need to like
use tooling around that.

177
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:21,915
So cps, for example can help you
to substitute those logging, no

178
00:12:21,915 --> 00:12:24,135
substitute, reduce those login volume.

179
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:28,910
Let's say or yeah, you can provide
your AI context that, okay, if you

180
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:33,390
have this incident at this particular
time, please use this particular time

181
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:38,110
and like plus minus 10 minutes or
something like that to understand if it's

182
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,060
enough information to investigate him.

183
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:45,700
If you need more, you can try to extend
that, but yeah, it depends on cases,

184
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,730
but yeah, you need to limit those stuff.

185
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,760
Because otherwise it'll be just okay.

186
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,300
I reached my contact.

187
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,470
I don't have any information
and yes, that's it.

188
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,360
I just burning tokens.

189
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,110
And yeah, so it was mostly about
like problems that we can face

190
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,650
and we need to control, but
there are also like ugly parts.

191
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:11,830
So like the problems that like can go over
itself and can cause much higher problems.

192
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:18,280
So one of the big problems that recently
start raising, it's like engineers trust.

193
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,580
Yeah.

194
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,870
Without verification.

195
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,240
So you just stamp, approve what?

196
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,480
Okay, I like this
solution, or I don't care.

197
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:25,660
Yeah.

198
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:31,000
I just like Gomo with clo mo with
CLO coat or anything like that.

199
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,170
And you start just, okay.

200
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,140
Do is this?

201
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,925
So I have did like some projects where
I just didn't know any line of quote

202
00:13:37,925 --> 00:13:39,725
and the structure of the project itself.

203
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,345
It just wrote something.

204
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:46,245
But it's, yeah, it's fine for small
systems, small projects when yeah,

205
00:13:46,245 --> 00:13:50,735
it start growing and you add like
such kind of stuff to your system.

206
00:13:50,735 --> 00:13:53,225
It can collect errors pretty fast.

207
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:56,595
It can like eventually
cause much higher incidents.

208
00:13:56,635 --> 00:14:01,495
Yeah, and this like human in the loop,
like it stopped working because even

209
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:06,775
because of that, because yeah, people
just stamp and they don't check,

210
00:14:06,925 --> 00:14:13,595
and it's happen more and related
problems, it's like senior engineer,

211
00:14:13,595 --> 00:14:18,975
like skills degrade because like they
start using it much more and like they.

212
00:14:19,865 --> 00:14:24,035
Not always check it and junior
engineer cannot learn because okay.

213
00:14:24,535 --> 00:14:28,495
Some companies, especially a few years
ago, like they start, okay, why do

214
00:14:28,495 --> 00:14:32,485
I need senior, like junior engineer
if I have senior engineer with ai?

215
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:37,265
And yeah, that goes like gap in
knowledge that sometimes companies

216
00:14:37,265 --> 00:14:39,485
will have some trouble to renew.

217
00:14:40,475 --> 00:14:40,835
Yeah.

218
00:14:40,835 --> 00:14:43,080
And companies already started to upskill.

219
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:48,800
People in this, but yeah, it's still
like a new problem that had to be checked

220
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:54,350
and as a one, it's not only related to
observability or engineering, so yeah,

221
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,000
generally like new way of attacking
and security problems with the system.

222
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,470
Mostly it's related to application, but
it's also can be related to observability

223
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:10,060
because it's important to limit your like
agents in scope and don't provide it,

224
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:13,025
like to, don't allow it to do everything.

225
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,880
Everything because there are
like such thing like prompt

226
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,920
injection and it's something like
SQL injection like 20 years ago.

227
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,040
So yeah.

228
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,640
You, some kind of malicious prompt
can be injected even in your

229
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,885
logs if you look at some kind of
request or anything like that.

230
00:15:32,905 --> 00:15:39,130
And that can eventually someone can put
such request into your logs and you can,

231
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,420
during investigation, pick that up and
execute some kind of malicious comment,

232
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:49,730
send some kind of data or execute some
actions that will expose your data or do

233
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:55,289
some kind of other stuff and we can like,
definitely see that trend is growing.

234
00:15:55,289 --> 00:16:00,160
So there are like almost six
times more like in injection

235
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,000
attacks, prompt injection attacks
than was like before in 2025.

236
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:11,305
So yeah, it's a huge problem and it's
still like just starting to grow.

237
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,120
Because it's a new one.

238
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,920
But yeah, of course, company.

239
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,760
Think about that.

240
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,140
And they start doing different practices.

241
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:24,970
So they limit the scope of where AI can
have an access, can internet requests

242
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,070
or like what tools it can access.

243
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,910
Read on the mode and like it
needs an approved for everything.

244
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:34,450
Yeah, so lots of stuff
to work around that.

245
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,805
But yeah, it's one of the.

246
00:16:36,305 --> 00:16:39,245
Big problem people had to work with.

247
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:46,315
So eventually yeah AI will continue
growing and where it's right now we can

248
00:16:46,315 --> 00:16:51,355
trust it for this, like data gathering,
data like aggregation, analyzing.

249
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:56,645
Recognition of different patterns
and like faster investigation and

250
00:16:56,735 --> 00:17:00,125
those emission analysis it can do.

251
00:17:00,475 --> 00:17:05,475
Yeah, because it if you explain how
to do that it can do it really great.

252
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:11,485
But you still need to verify, basically,
like you have to verify everything

253
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:15,875
because yeah, you cannot fully rely
because of the problem I mentioned before.

254
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:20,285
But yeah, of course like you
can rely on it, but like you

255
00:17:20,285 --> 00:17:22,145
cannot rely fully and verify.

256
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:26,355
You need to verify anonymous
execution because if you like not

257
00:17:26,355 --> 00:17:30,255
verify what it's doing, it can
collect like a reward pretty fast.

258
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:35,445
And like you cannot like rely at
the moment on high risk actions.

259
00:17:35,775 --> 00:17:39,645
So yeah, you have to approve it
and to check if everything goes.

260
00:17:40,165 --> 00:17:40,855
As a plan.

261
00:17:40,855 --> 00:17:45,345
So that's why there are lots of
processes in companies that like require

262
00:17:45,345 --> 00:17:50,945
another engineer to verify engineer's
work just because of the same issue.

263
00:17:50,975 --> 00:17:56,675
So not rely on a single point of failure,
like in this case, like someone commits

264
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,085
something and you just approve it.

265
00:17:58,655 --> 00:18:04,585
And yeah, like new incidents and
most likely in current situation.

266
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:04,885
Yeah.

267
00:18:05,315 --> 00:18:08,495
Usually you have to be this,
make this final decision.

268
00:18:08,895 --> 00:18:13,095
But yeah, you can rely on AI on
some kind of basic analysis because

269
00:18:13,095 --> 00:18:14,715
it's like usually helps a lot.

270
00:18:15,465 --> 00:18:16,445
And yeah.

271
00:18:16,445 --> 00:18:17,225
So at the moment.

272
00:18:17,975 --> 00:18:23,425
No, you can think about AI as a not
replacement, but like more like a pilot

273
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:28,855
or, I like to think about that as a
kind of ai, as a like force multiplier.

274
00:18:28,855 --> 00:18:34,735
I just extend your capabilities, like
in times it can scale productivity, like

275
00:18:34,735 --> 00:18:36,775
decision making and impact you can make.

276
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:40,145
But with one caveat, it just
multiply everything if you don't

277
00:18:40,145 --> 00:18:44,395
control it, it'll multiply your
mistakes rules you collect and risks.

278
00:18:44,705 --> 00:18:45,155
Yeah.

279
00:18:45,545 --> 00:18:50,765
As we know with great power comes great
responsibility and we have to remember it.

280
00:18:51,455 --> 00:18:58,360
But yeah, I totally AI and I'm using
it every day and yeah, it's, growing is

281
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,610
huge, but it have to be under control.

282
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:01,780
So yeah.

283
00:19:02,515 --> 00:19:03,995
Thanks for listening.

284
00:19:04,495 --> 00:19:04,785
Okay.
