1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:00,830
Speaker 20: Hi.

2
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:01,639
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:02,059 --> 00:00:02,990
This is Puja.

4
00:00:03,479 --> 00:00:08,969
I am excited to be presenting at the
conference 42 Machine Learning of 2026.

5
00:00:09,579 --> 00:00:11,379
What a great way to start a year.

6
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:18,599
Talking about the IT of the IT
industry and the IT of all technology

7
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:23,879
that is machine learning and all the
cool advancements and developments

8
00:00:23,909 --> 00:00:25,169
we are seeing in the industry here.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,600
So let's dive into it.

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,820
Let me share my screen and, yeah.

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:32,610
Okay.

12
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:36,254
So I will go into the slideshow mode.

13
00:00:36,754 --> 00:00:42,305
Yeah, let's talk a little bit about me
first before we get into the fun stuff.

14
00:00:42,885 --> 00:00:44,265
I am Puja Ranjan.

15
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:48,015
I am an engineering
manager in Oracle America.

16
00:00:48,434 --> 00:00:50,175
I work in the Silicon Valley.

17
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:53,105
I work specifically for Oracle Cloud.

18
00:00:53,385 --> 00:00:58,684
Oracle Cloud has a lot of and recently
Oracle Cloud was the winner in the

19
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:04,375
second winner in the category of
highly fast growing cloud companies

20
00:01:04,884 --> 00:01:06,294
according to Gartner ratings.

21
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:11,174
We are doing a lot of cool cutting
edge feature development for cloud.

22
00:01:11,674 --> 00:01:15,484
And the push in the last couple
of years has been totally towards

23
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:19,654
building more AI centric tools
that will simplify enterprise

24
00:01:19,654 --> 00:01:21,994
use cases and business use cases.

25
00:01:22,564 --> 00:01:25,734
So yeah, I've been in this space
for about over a decade now.

26
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:28,134
I started as an software engineer.

27
00:01:28,504 --> 00:01:31,744
I worked on several SaaS
platforms and projects.

28
00:01:32,114 --> 00:01:35,594
I worked on one of one
of Zoom's competitors.

29
00:01:35,594 --> 00:01:37,334
Actually, zoom is our online meeting.

30
00:01:37,724 --> 00:01:41,380
A solution that most of you are aware
of, there is another product called

31
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:47,019
GoToMeeting, and I was the person who
was the, who started as an at 11 engineer

32
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:50,989
and then went to the lead engineer
level there on building it deploying

33
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:54,650
it, hosting it, and shipping it, and
constantly collecting customer feedback.

34
00:01:54,650 --> 00:02:00,010
And then, keeping on optimizing that
product over Oracle, like for the far

35
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:04,450
past four years, I, again, I started as an
engineer on this team as a lead engineer.

36
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,940
Then I shipped out some AI
ML solutions for the cloud.

37
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,210
My target audience has been data science,
data scientists, so I build machine

38
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,420
learning related tools that they could
use in their day-to-day lives too.

39
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,340
Make the entire ML engineering
pipeline simple for them and to

40
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,970
leverage the security and reliability
and availability of the cloud to to

41
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,085
keep, to make their lives easier.

42
00:02:28,585 --> 00:02:32,155
Over the past three years, I have
been leading a team of engineers.

43
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:35,774
It's a mix of software engineers and
machine learning engineers, and we try

44
00:02:35,774 --> 00:02:41,254
to again, come up with the coolest tools
that we can ship out to data scientists

45
00:02:41,254 --> 00:02:44,874
so they can easily extract, if they
have fragmented data sets, they can

46
00:02:45,174 --> 00:02:46,734
move all the data set on the cloud.

47
00:02:47,304 --> 00:02:51,754
So for migration purposes, for data
labeling purposes, for to organize

48
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:55,184
the data, especially unstructured
data to search through the data,

49
00:02:55,244 --> 00:02:59,434
all the tools that Oracle Cloud
provides and other providers also

50
00:02:59,484 --> 00:03:01,554
other competitive cloud providers do.

51
00:03:02,054 --> 00:03:06,984
At the same time we have we help
them, like models are a very big

52
00:03:06,984 --> 00:03:08,564
part of ML engineering, right?

53
00:03:08,874 --> 00:03:14,614
Building models, all the tools that they
need to have, like smart models smart

54
00:03:14,614 --> 00:03:17,524
model building and all the contact packs
that they need, all the environments they

55
00:03:17,524 --> 00:03:19,964
need to set up do provide tools for that.

56
00:03:20,524 --> 00:03:22,814
After that we also do, some more.

57
00:03:23,274 --> 00:03:25,614
ML tools, two one STEM models already.

58
00:03:25,614 --> 00:03:26,934
We provide ML tools.

59
00:03:26,934 --> 00:03:33,034
I overlook those divisions where we
deploy those models to our large scale

60
00:03:33,494 --> 00:03:35,354
heavy duty bare metal instances where.

61
00:03:36,054 --> 00:03:40,404
There is very little hypervisor between
you and your workload, or we have them

62
00:03:40,404 --> 00:03:43,674
deploy to GPUs that are shipped by
standard manufacturers like Nvidia.

63
00:03:44,244 --> 00:03:46,914
So deploying those models,
training them, retraining their

64
00:03:46,914 --> 00:03:51,364
models storing the results, doing
performing analytics on them.

65
00:03:52,174 --> 00:03:56,494
And so the, these workflows basically
are a part of my day-to-day life.

66
00:03:57,484 --> 00:04:00,244
So yeah, let's go to.

67
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:06,074
Why what we are doing right now in the
Silicon Valley is important for, the

68
00:04:06,074 --> 00:04:08,464
machine learning evolution altogether.

69
00:04:09,434 --> 00:04:13,564
So machine learning obviously is
is having, especially now AI are

70
00:04:13,684 --> 00:04:19,074
large language models integrating
them, using them as drive that a lot

71
00:04:19,074 --> 00:04:22,524
of large scale cloud organizations
and also smaller startups, smaller

72
00:04:22,524 --> 00:04:24,894
AI startups are totally going for.

73
00:04:25,394 --> 00:04:28,934
I, the trend that I see in the
Silicon Valley is, hey, let's

74
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:33,164
solve the more business use
cases we solve, the better it is.

75
00:04:33,164 --> 00:04:36,254
For example a simple one is it support.

76
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:40,324
So in the past organizations and
my current organization anybody

77
00:04:40,324 --> 00:04:43,834
having a problem with setting up
a policy or having an access issue

78
00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:49,084
while logging in or accessing some
specific tools or information.

79
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:53,299
I had to go through, obviously, the
wedding, and there was rules around

80
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:56,629
who can get access and whatnot, but
then troubleshooting was an issue.

81
00:04:56,929 --> 00:05:01,439
So then you had to wait for a person to
unblock you or come and help you out.

82
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:05,399
Sometimes the person had to be on
site to help you, that could add some

83
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:08,399
more delay and some more frustrations
to you trying to get your job done,

84
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,929
but having these logistical issues.

85
00:05:10,499 --> 00:05:16,269
But now with all these AI ML models
and innovation that bit has been.

86
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:22,209
I would say 70% automated, because
most of these articles on how to

87
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:26,079
troubleshoot and how to go deeper when
something is wrong are all written, but

88
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,589
they're fragmented in so many places
across the organization's databases.

89
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:32,849
And then sometimes some of this
information is also just public

90
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:36,239
information that's available
on some of Google's websites.

91
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:40,529
So I, we have now in
the AI space deployed.

92
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:45,769
Models that are smart it support
assistants and the past three

93
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:48,739
tickets that I had to file because
of some missing access or permissions

94
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:52,099
were resolved by just talking
to the bot in my organization.

95
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:54,689
The bot could point me
towards the right documents.

96
00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:56,294
Walk me through the steps.

97
00:05:56,604 --> 00:06:01,404
It could exactly pinpoint which permission
or which user group was I not a part of.

98
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:04,234
And and I also asked it, Hey,
but I was a part of this.

99
00:06:04,234 --> 00:06:05,134
I didn't know I was thrown out.

100
00:06:05,134 --> 00:06:09,214
So then it put together a plan on
how to, it'll automatically set

101
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:13,034
up a reminder for me to renew my
permissions every time they expire.

102
00:06:13,464 --> 00:06:17,654
Yeah, these level this is just an example
of how we are now integrating models

103
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:21,864
into our space of software development,
machine learning, engineering, the

104
00:06:21,864 --> 00:06:23,664
whole technology bracket basically.

105
00:06:24,024 --> 00:06:26,854
And that is helping us ship.

106
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:32,239
Focus on the real problems of machine
of data scientists and ML engineers

107
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:36,359
rather than spending our time on the
logistics part of everything that we

108
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:38,339
need to do to have access to our systems.

109
00:06:39,309 --> 00:06:44,389
Yeah, and just this example, if you look
at the entire flow end-to-end pipeline,

110
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:47,209
be it machine learning engineering
pipeline, or a software development

111
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:51,049
engineering pipeline that's ML enabled,
all these pipelines are very heavily.

112
00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:55,089
Inspired now and are benefiting
from having machine learning

113
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:58,989
integrated into several aspects and
several phases of their projects.

114
00:06:59,489 --> 00:07:00,839
Why is all this important?

115
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:05,499
Because if you look at the revenue
and the business that SAS systems

116
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:10,959
that cloud systems generate for the
Silicon Valley, it's over 350,000.

117
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:14,644
Three 50 billion plus revenue annually.

118
00:07:15,044 --> 00:07:17,954
And like just three to four top
players of the Silicon Valley are

119
00:07:17,954 --> 00:07:19,854
able to bring this revenue together.

120
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:23,934
And not only does it create this huge.

121
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,889
Industry with huge revenue.

122
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:31,499
It is also providing a lot of governance
and regulation in terms of how smaller

123
00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:37,239
businesses or enterprise customers, or
even a small or a personal entrepreneur.

124
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:41,259
If I want to have a small shop on
eBay or Etsy to sell a few of my

125
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:45,279
things I would be able to do that
in a secure and a reliable way by

126
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,659
creating an account with one of them.

127
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:48,369
So it's empowering.

128
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:53,284
People to have to go and build
and focus on their, again, on

129
00:07:53,284 --> 00:07:54,724
their actual business use case.

130
00:07:54,754 --> 00:07:56,884
Just worry about how will I sell this?

131
00:07:56,884 --> 00:07:59,434
And not worry about, oh,
how will I host this?

132
00:07:59,434 --> 00:08:01,294
Will my web website be up all the time?

133
00:08:01,624 --> 00:08:04,324
Will I be under some
sort of security threat?

134
00:08:04,654 --> 00:08:06,184
Or will my customer's data be lost?

135
00:08:06,364 --> 00:08:11,044
So all these problems can be outsourced
to the cloud to a SAS organization.

136
00:08:11,434 --> 00:08:12,094
And.

137
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:15,544
You as an individual or as a
business owner can only focus

138
00:08:15,544 --> 00:08:17,164
on your business use cases.

139
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:20,494
How do I get my customers
to buy my things?

140
00:08:20,494 --> 00:08:21,514
How do I boost that?

141
00:08:21,894 --> 00:08:23,094
Or what are the problems?

142
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:24,504
Why are these products not selling?

143
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,644
Or why are, why is this the most
highly returned thing in my catalog?

144
00:08:29,424 --> 00:08:32,214
So you can focus on that and you can
use ML engineering for that as well.

145
00:08:32,724 --> 00:08:35,524
But the whole logistics
and deployment part of it.

146
00:08:35,864 --> 00:08:38,084
That helps you maintain
an online presence.

147
00:08:38,294 --> 00:08:41,534
All of that has been shipped
out and that empowers you to

148
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:45,044
to have more smaller businesses
and in turn then generating more

149
00:08:45,044 --> 00:08:46,484
opportunities, more revenue, and so on.

150
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:51,404
So now that if you think of like
a customer or a person who wants

151
00:08:51,404 --> 00:08:55,734
to use I will, I can actually give
a data scientist example because

152
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:57,354
that sounds more machine learning.

153
00:08:58,074 --> 00:09:03,534
So if you talk about a data scientist who
wants to maybe has fragmented data sets

154
00:09:03,534 --> 00:09:07,964
and now wants to put everything together
and extract meaningful patterns from it,

155
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:14,614
see and, get the most out of the data
that they have what can they do about it?

156
00:09:15,114 --> 00:09:16,074
As step one, right?

157
00:09:16,074 --> 00:09:18,754
If they come to a cloud or
if they come, go to any cloud

158
00:09:18,814 --> 00:09:22,485
organization and request for certain
services like how do you start?

159
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,850
The first thing is like
feature definition.

160
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,890
So you might have a lot of data, but what
are you expecting to get out of the data?

161
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:31,490
There are two things.

162
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,460
What are you expecting versus what
the data is already giving you?

163
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:40,190
So for you to hey, I expect this data
to tell me the number of consumers

164
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,200
or the months in which the sale of.

165
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,530
Certain products go up, and now
I have this retail data that's

166
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,209
billions and billions of terabytes.

167
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:55,060
In these stages what you do is that
you use AI defined models, like

168
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,739
organizations will offer you a support.

169
00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:00,729
An option to choose okay, do you want
us to tell you the latest and the

170
00:10:00,729 --> 00:10:02,469
greatest of what the industry wants?

171
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,869
You may or may not have that data,
but there exists large language

172
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:10,199
models now that organizations
will offer you for nominal fee.

173
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:15,079
And these models strain on the latest
marketing trends that are collected.

174
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:16,189
And there are several sources.

175
00:10:16,189 --> 00:10:20,780
We're not gonna go into the sources of how
marketing data is collected in this for

176
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,790
the purposes to keep the scope limited.

177
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:28,210
But assuming that there exists marketing
data from several sources they do exist.

178
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,360
A whole bunch of models that will help
you train that will help you pull out

179
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,705
advertisement specific information to
help you what is the next big feature.

180
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,260
That your customer wants.

181
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:44,410
So as a data scientist who wants to
get most out of data that is sales

182
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,760
related our AI ML models integrated into
our system will give you an insight.

183
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,620
They will run they will train
on billions and billions of

184
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,410
sales data sets, excuse me.

185
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,520
And they will tell you what is the
next cool thing the customer wants.

186
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,969
A recent example in our times has
been, some customers requested

187
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:07,370
auto code, like a code assist, code
assistance integration into their

188
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,540
development environments where the
code assist could explain code to them.

189
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:15,720
It could interpret the code for them,
it could auto generate some unit tests.

190
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,230
So all these things, that's a feature
request that even the customer

191
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,610
did not know that they wanted.

192
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,650
But when AI recommended these things
to them they were very happy to cus oh

193
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,880
wow, I could do something like that.

194
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:33,020
After that comes in the part where maybe
the data scientist is not very heavily

195
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,970
involved, but it could move towards the
the software development engineering

196
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,670
part of it where machine learning
engineers actually come into play.

197
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,050
They look at architectural
design and UML compliance.

198
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:48,110
If you have a feature request how
will your provider provide it to you?

199
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,660
They could either have that
feature available and it's just

200
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,500
about doing the legalities and.

201
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,150
Sales part of it where you come on board.

202
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,180
But the other bit is if the feature
is missing, we will go back.

203
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,550
The cloud provider will go back and
build it for the data scientist.

204
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,200
This stage is so every cloud
provider again follows very

205
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,980
strict networking patterns.

206
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,170
Architecture two a, two B, two C,
three C are some common examples that

207
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,530
can be Googled in networking patterns.

208
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,530
And then there are compliance tools
that make sure that every time you

209
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:19,310
make a feature request sometimes it's
called release management related tools.

210
00:12:19,915 --> 00:12:23,605
And what these tools do is every
time you generate a new design

211
00:12:23,605 --> 00:12:26,825
for a new feature they run over,
they run some compliance checks.

212
00:12:26,825 --> 00:12:30,785
They run security checks to ensure that
you're not creating a breach or a leak.

213
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:35,765
They run some regression, they set
some platform acceptance standards in

214
00:12:35,765 --> 00:12:38,315
related to and with regards to testing.

215
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:41,335
And they also make sure that
the new architecture that

216
00:12:41,335 --> 00:12:43,315
you're introducing, the changes.

217
00:12:43,365 --> 00:12:44,805
Are you introducing API changes.

218
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:47,165
Are you introducing UI changes?

219
00:12:47,655 --> 00:12:51,305
Are you introducing like an
infrastructure as a level kind of

220
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:52,865
change, which is like a terraform change?

221
00:12:53,505 --> 00:12:57,925
If you're doing all these, then there are
other regulatory standards to ensure that

222
00:12:58,265 --> 00:13:01,445
your changes do not break or regress.

223
00:13:02,155 --> 00:13:04,555
Anything that the organization
is already offering.

224
00:13:05,055 --> 00:13:07,395
Once the architecture has been
laid out, that's when secure

225
00:13:07,395 --> 00:13:08,865
development and testing comes in.

226
00:13:08,865 --> 00:13:12,285
There's a huge bunch of software
engineers who will build code, will

227
00:13:12,285 --> 00:13:17,105
build they might use code assistant
technologies again to comp, interpret,

228
00:13:17,105 --> 00:13:20,595
comprehend to refactor that code, to
test the performance of that code.

229
00:13:21,285 --> 00:13:25,865
Once that is done they will
once they open a pull request,

230
00:13:25,865 --> 00:13:27,335
as we call it, a pull request.

231
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:29,675
There will be several tests run on it.

232
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,755
Although it's, it does require
some level of manual approval,

233
00:13:32,755 --> 00:13:33,835
it's not touchless totally.

234
00:13:34,225 --> 00:13:38,305
We do want developers to look at other
developers code and ensure that, Hey,

235
00:13:38,365 --> 00:13:42,775
this change looks good to me as a
developer before we let AI and ML take

236
00:13:42,775 --> 00:13:44,845
over and run compliance checks on it.

237
00:13:45,595 --> 00:13:49,075
Once that happens, it's usually
merging and then putting it out there.

238
00:13:49,335 --> 00:13:53,195
The deployment pipeline is totally is
totally orchestrated to be touchless.

239
00:13:53,195 --> 00:13:58,955
So once you build and test in a certain
testing environment, you will roll it out

240
00:13:59,015 --> 00:14:04,605
to like you will have a terraform level
infrastructure as a service tool that

241
00:14:04,605 --> 00:14:10,135
will help you roll out your changes into
a more production-like environment first

242
00:14:10,135 --> 00:14:11,425
and then into an environment and the.

243
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,030
In the live environment where
and usually you deploy it into a

244
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:21,660
smaller scale region where there are
lesser there are lesser customers.

245
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:25,500
Again, you have that insight from
the data that you collect and then

246
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,980
you deploy it to all your popular
regions with minimal impact to.

247
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,720
Existing performance of your system.

248
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,210
And then along with this,
there will be some compliance

249
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,440
verification standards, et cetera.

250
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,420
And so there are SOCs
as vpa data governance.

251
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:45,420
So there are certain e every
country basically has some

252
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,070
regulatory standards around data.

253
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:52,100
It implies not only to accessibility
and security, these compliances also

254
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,460
apply to, ease of use in simple terms.

255
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,140
So for example, VPA compliance says
that everybody, your websites have

256
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,970
to be accessible to anybody who's
reading a use, who is using a screen

257
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:07,020
reader or like an interpreter device.

258
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:13,190
Because they could have some hearing or
listening or speech related disabilities.

259
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,640
So your, the data, your website
should be very accessible to people

260
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,270
like these SOX compliance ensure that
everything that you promise a customer

261
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,310
or a data scientist you have set.

262
00:15:24,585 --> 00:15:26,685
Acceptance, minimum acceptance standards.

263
00:15:27,165 --> 00:15:32,125
And unless those standards are met,
you cannot call that criteria done.

264
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:36,925
Of course there are more legal legal and
sales later terms that come, but these are

265
00:15:36,925 --> 00:15:39,655
at the core software engineering level.

266
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:42,175
These policies are established
for a software engineer to

267
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:45,985
manage the expectations and
the requirements of a product.

268
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:51,805
So once a data scientist has requested
a feature that maybe was not there, but

269
00:15:51,805 --> 00:15:54,595
they wanted to use it on the cloud, and
the software engineering teams and ML

270
00:15:54,595 --> 00:15:56,245
teams have built it and deployed it.

271
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:59,095
There be some level of continuous
monitoring and automation, and

272
00:15:59,095 --> 00:16:01,675
that also requires a lot of
tools and ML specific tools.

273
00:16:01,675 --> 00:16:02,755
We talk about them ML more.

274
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:03,810
So yeah.

275
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:07,170
What have, introducing these
tools and letting smaller

276
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:10,630
businesses, data scientists what
has this done to the industry?

277
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,830
What it has primarily done is that
it has it has empowered them, as I

278
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:19,640
mentioned in the past, but how do you
continuously monitor something like that?

279
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,310
So to continuously monitor and monitor
something like that companies typically

280
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,340
sign an SLA service level agreements.

281
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,130
And these service level agreements,
again, they come at the legal.

282
00:16:29,935 --> 00:16:32,755
Aspect and sales aspect first, where
there'll be terms, you will sign

283
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:37,035
clauses with the companies, but for
continuous monitoring a company usually

284
00:16:37,035 --> 00:16:42,525
promises like 99.99% times availability
that the service is gonna be up.

285
00:16:42,555 --> 00:16:46,475
If you host your website on our
cloud, excuse me, your website

286
00:16:46,685 --> 00:16:49,085
will be up and running for.

287
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:52,890
All of the year, except for
maybe two or three hours of

288
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:56,240
downtime, which is unpredictable,
could happen, could not happen.

289
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,230
But that's the max.

290
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,100
Your website will go down
and are reliable, secure.

291
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,720
Hardware, data centers, and
all the software we write over

292
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,240
it is gonna ensure that your
website is always up and running.

293
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:12,250
So these benchmarks also there
are other benchmarks around

294
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,240
sustainability and clean.

295
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,840
A few of them apply to companies
internally who are the cloud providers,

296
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,130
and some apply to the people, the
customer who's walking in as well.

297
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,480
And to maintain these compliance
and standards and reliability.

298
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,490
Excuse me.

299
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,760
A lot of requests okay, now when you
send a request okay, now I'm a data

300
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,470
scientist, I'm sending in a new request.

301
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,145
I am sending a request to maybe
create or launch a notebook or

302
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:43,035
Jupyter lab notebook, which could
be, which is actually just a vs.

303
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:45,615
Code editor equivalent
for a software engineer.

304
00:17:46,015 --> 00:17:49,825
Now you launch a notebook because
you want to build a model inside it.

305
00:17:50,485 --> 00:17:55,255
So the request that I send it should
be fulfilled under 500 millisecond.

306
00:17:55,255 --> 00:17:58,555
If that's not happening, then that's
something that I put as a service

307
00:17:58,555 --> 00:17:59,910
level agreement to my cloud provider.

308
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:05,000
And the cloud provider then runs
tools, automation tools to ensure that

309
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,120
there are constant monitoring alarms.

310
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,840
There are health check alarms that run to
ensure that this requirement is being met.

311
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,745
And the minute we don't, even
in the ML world now, we are

312
00:18:13,745 --> 00:18:15,395
not even waiting for a breach.

313
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:19,750
We don't wait for the threshold to cross
500 milliseconds before you alarm and let.

314
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,800
Teams know that something is not right.

315
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,460
You start alarming at 300 milliseconds.

316
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,790
You expect your system to respond
within 200 to two 50 milliseconds.

317
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,790
And then if it's crossing
300, you start alarming.

318
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,060
You start creating tickets and
you start, and ML engineering not

319
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:37,390
only creates the alarm, but also
starts analyzing some possible ways.

320
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,765
Is there a hardware issue?

321
00:18:38,765 --> 00:18:40,585
Is that, is there a scheduling issue?

322
00:18:40,945 --> 00:18:43,075
Is there a round robin?

323
00:18:43,285 --> 00:18:44,935
Did one of these data centers come down?

324
00:18:44,935 --> 00:18:45,415
What happened?

325
00:18:45,915 --> 00:18:49,505
Or is there too much overload and
is this a noisy neighbors problem?

326
00:18:49,905 --> 00:18:52,245
Tenancy level issue, so
everything ML can help you.

327
00:18:52,515 --> 00:18:57,975
ML is helping us at this point of
time optimize how do we look at

328
00:18:57,975 --> 00:19:02,005
these problems and eventually provide
like great quality service to any

329
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:03,970
customer who is using the cloud.

330
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,950
Yeah, I did touch upon these regulatory
frameworks a little bit in the past.

331
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,810
So let's skip these for now.

332
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:10,610
Yeah.

333
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,620
Now in this pipeline of continuously
providing help and doing these things,

334
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,900
I spoke about Terraform bamboo and ci.

335
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,240
So now with.

336
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:24,280
Specifically talking about the CI ICD
stack and how it once a developer or a

337
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:29,410
machine engineer has built a cool feature
for his customer base, how is that gonna

338
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,820
land up in these production realms?

339
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,070
And what role does AI play here?

340
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:37,600
So although there are these automation
tools like GitLab, CI ICD, and even these

341
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,870
tools, these are third party tools and
even these tools are now integrating.

342
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:46,840
ML Insights through large language
models to understand what other

343
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,280
compliance gates are necessary.

344
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,530
So there are different tools
like clever that will analyze

345
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,880
the code coverage percentage.

346
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:56,660
You want to ensure that the best quality
code rolls out to your production regions.

347
00:19:57,165 --> 00:20:00,425
So for that, you're gonna use you
will have an integrated use of these

348
00:20:00,425 --> 00:20:04,645
tools and the ai and the algorithm
the large language or the small

349
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:10,185
language model that's optimizing your
prs your code that's coming in that

350
00:20:10,185 --> 00:20:11,805
will run all these compliance tools.

351
00:20:11,805 --> 00:20:13,995
It'll ensure that your
code coverage is optimal.

352
00:20:14,305 --> 00:20:17,485
If it drops below a certain percentage,
you're not allowed to merge that code.

353
00:20:17,635 --> 00:20:20,425
You have to add, you have to generate
your unit tests, you have to generate

354
00:20:20,425 --> 00:20:25,325
aggression tests, or you have to, it'll
run security tests to make sure that

355
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:32,120
it'll lie all those standards instead of
Strat static security run time where it it

356
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:36,650
bombards your, like cross two, like it'll
simulate basically cross side scripting.

357
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,305
In a way it will simulate
denial of service attacks.

358
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:44,100
So these tools now can auto do
these on all your prs and all

359
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,270
your code that you're merging in.

360
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:48,550
And then it'll merge
into the master system.

361
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,960
It'll produce a build.

362
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:52,270
It'll produce a build,
which is like an artifact.

363
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,630
And that artifact has to be
deployed through Terraform into

364
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,765
all these several data centers.

365
00:20:57,265 --> 00:21:01,475
Yeah, at every stage, ML is gonna
keep doing compliance automation

366
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:04,605
regression test to ensure
that your delivery is perfect.

367
00:21:05,105 --> 00:21:05,495
Yeah.

368
00:21:05,495 --> 00:21:10,835
And obviously the, coming back to the
resource optimization part of it, yes.

369
00:21:10,885 --> 00:21:14,455
Hardware optimization is a very major
deal for cloud providing companies

370
00:21:14,455 --> 00:21:15,895
because sustainability matters.

371
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:17,675
Your carbon footprint matters.

372
00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:20,925
We know that data scientists
and data engineer.

373
00:21:21,095 --> 00:21:23,315
Who manage like these huge data centers.

374
00:21:23,655 --> 00:21:26,315
They know that like the usage
of electricity and water to

375
00:21:26,405 --> 00:21:28,145
cool these data centers down.

376
00:21:28,145 --> 00:21:31,565
And all of this has a very
huge environmental impact.

377
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:35,465
So you can pay for it and
you can afford to pay for it.

378
00:21:35,465 --> 00:21:39,370
But then we are, we also have
responsibility towards the planet.

379
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,630
How are we utilizing ML in this space?

380
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,450
Machine learning optimizations now
most organizations like cloud engineer,

381
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:50,710
engineering orgs, especially huge orgs
that all orgs that, that manufacture

382
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,050
hardware or use hardware at a large scale.

383
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,040
They do have several.

384
00:21:55,955 --> 00:21:59,115
Machine learning tools like something
it could be called something like a

385
00:21:59,115 --> 00:22:04,735
cloud guard where these tools constantly
keep monitoring the usage of every

386
00:22:04,735 --> 00:22:06,205
server instance that is brought up.

387
00:22:06,705 --> 00:22:10,635
And if over a period of time if it
senses that, hey, your utilizations

388
00:22:10,635 --> 00:22:13,845
always lower, then it will cut down on.

389
00:22:14,505 --> 00:22:17,385
It'll automatically resize your
instances to a smaller size.

390
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:21,045
It'll run all load and performance
tests to ensure that the quality of

391
00:22:21,045 --> 00:22:25,695
services, not impli, is not degraded,
but you end up having some savings

392
00:22:25,695 --> 00:22:31,605
on how much CPU or GPU bandwidth or
memory that you're using there, you

393
00:22:31,605 --> 00:22:35,325
will start saving on that and that
will have a good environmental impact.

394
00:22:35,825 --> 00:22:36,095
Yeah.

395
00:22:36,095 --> 00:22:39,905
So I spoke about these policies in
detail and how are we building and

396
00:22:40,005 --> 00:22:42,135
monitoring at every stage of deployments.

397
00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:43,275
And yeah.

398
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:47,125
In summary, I would like to say
that, this is just the beginning for

399
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:52,555
most ML and AI integration systems,
and it's a promising future ahead.

400
00:22:52,855 --> 00:22:57,175
We have a lot of business and data,
sciencey based use cases that are

401
00:22:57,175 --> 00:23:00,615
benefiting and will continue to
benefit in the future because of the

402
00:23:00,615 --> 00:23:06,015
integration of large language models
and prompts and the data that we've

403
00:23:06,015 --> 00:23:07,605
collected over decades and decades.

404
00:23:08,205 --> 00:23:17,800
And the growth the growth and, the
growth of and explosion of AI for not

405
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,770
only, like smaller level use cases,
but even very high level use cases

406
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:28,210
like, or completely replacing search
algorithms with, large language models.

407
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,360
These things are in progress and these
things will continue to grow over time

408
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,180
and it's a very exciting future ahead.

409
00:23:35,135 --> 00:23:39,580
So thank you for joining me on this
talk and I hope to see you guys in

410
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,300
person in the, in the in-person meet.

411
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,470
Thank you everyone.
