00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,340
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,789 --> 00:00:05,390
I'm excited to present enhancing
enterprise security with ai,

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,780
a strategic framework for
automation and threat management.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,879
As cybersecurity threats continue to
evolve in sophistication and frequency,

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,660
organizations are turning towards
artificial intelligence as a game

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,480
changing LA to their security operations.

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,620
This framework explores how AI is
transforming enterprise security

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,120
automation and threat management.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,260
In this presentation, we'll examine
the essential components of AI

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,820
driven cybersecurity architecture,
how it enhances network security.

11
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:40,040
Automates reporting and enables proactive
security, pro poster management.

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,349
Ultimately creating more resilient
systems that can adopt to continuously

13
00:00:44,349 --> 00:00:45,550
changing threat landscape.

14
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,949
AI is changing how we protect our
networks and systems from cyber threats.

15
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,300
It helps us detect potential issues
faster, respond more efficiently,

16
00:00:54,569 --> 00:00:57,900
and adopt our security systems
to new and evolving threats.

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,230
This is important because
cyber attacks are becoming more

18
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,580
sophisticated and frequent.

19
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,590
AI brings us the ability to not
only defend against known threats,

20
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,860
but also to predict and stop
unknowns before they can cause harm.

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,460
Imagine you are a
security guard at a bank.

22
00:01:13,179 --> 00:01:16,000
Traditional methods would only
help you spot obvious threats

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,470
like a person trying to break in.

24
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,789
But AI would help you spot subtle
signs like a person trying to

25
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:25,630
gather information about security
systems even before they act.

26
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,840
The growing AI security adoption
landscape, the adoption of AI powered

27
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,430
cybersecurity solutions has witnessed
exponential growth over past five years.

28
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:40,304
Organizations across industries are
recognizing the value of integrating

29
00:01:40,335 --> 00:01:42,464
AI to their security infrastructures.

30
00:01:42,914 --> 00:01:45,434
Therefore, trend is driven
by compelling results.

31
00:01:45,934 --> 00:01:50,104
The key benefits of implementing
AI is reduced breach life cycle.

32
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:55,324
AI powered solutions significantly shorten
the time from threat identification

33
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,625
to contaminant cost savings.

34
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:03,685
Organizations utilize AI in their security
operations, realize cost savings up to 60%

35
00:02:03,685 --> 00:02:06,445
compared to traditional security methods.

36
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:08,114
Let's take an example.

37
00:02:08,654 --> 00:02:11,984
Think about a company dealing with
hundreds of security alerts daily.

38
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:15,855
Without ai, the security team has
to manually check each one leading

39
00:02:15,855 --> 00:02:18,195
to delays and missed threats.

40
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:21,105
But with AI, the system
automatically filters.

41
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,439
And prioritize alerts, making it
much easier for the team to focus

42
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,759
on critical issues, straight away.

43
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:30,199
Core components of AI
driven security framework.

44
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:34,729
A robust AI driven security
framework is built upon multiple

45
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:36,319
interconnected components.

46
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:40,569
At its foundation is a comprehensive
data collection and analysis

47
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:42,339
that fits intelligent systems.

48
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:46,539
Intelligence power machines,
learning models that accelerate

49
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:51,309
identifying anomalies that signature
based approaches often miss.

50
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:55,719
The middle layers enable automated
incident response through orchestration.

51
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:58,799
Technologies that accelerate
remediation at the top.

52
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:02,820
Predictive capabilities provide
pro defense by anticipating

53
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,290
potential attack factor before they
materialize a security poster that

54
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,684
stays ahead of emerging threats.

55
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:14,144
We, we would also like to integrate
a zero zero trust architecture.

56
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:15,814
Let's take an example.

57
00:03:16,174 --> 00:03:20,104
It's like setting up an automated home
security system where sensors detect

58
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:25,554
motion cameras, monitors suspicious
activity, and alarms go off before

59
00:03:25,554 --> 00:03:27,079
a burglar even tries to break in.

60
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:31,170
AI enhanced anomaly detection,
pattern recognition.

61
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,429
AI algorithms detect septal patterns
and correlates in network behavior

62
00:03:35,429 --> 00:03:37,200
that human analysis might miss.

63
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,560
Behavioral baselines.

64
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,100
Machine learning establishes
normal operation baselines,

65
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,780
flagging deviations with greater
accuracy and fewer false positives.

66
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:49,654
Real time analysis.

67
00:03:49,894 --> 00:03:54,305
Continuous monitoring provides instant
threat assessment and actionable

68
00:03:54,305 --> 00:03:56,135
intelligence for security teams.

69
00:03:56,464 --> 00:03:57,365
Adaptive learning.

70
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:02,735
AI systems evolve by incorporating new
data, improving detection capabilities

71
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:04,414
as threat landscape changes.

72
00:04:04,914 --> 00:04:06,024
Let's take an example.

73
00:04:06,534 --> 00:04:10,404
If an employee who usually logs in
from one location suddenly logs in

74
00:04:10,404 --> 00:04:15,354
from a foreign country, AI spots this
anomaly and flags it as suspicious.

75
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,500
Even though it might not be a direct
attack yet, let's take one more example.

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,400
An employee who logs in normally
from eight to five has an

77
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,550
unusual login somewhere around
3:00 AM or maybe, 2:00 AM.

78
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:36,720
So AI flags those suspicious
activities and based on that.

79
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:43,080
It can take some action like blocking
that account or analyzing the severity

80
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,880
and criticality of the application.

81
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,919
Based on that, it can take actions.

82
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:53,049
Automated incident response capabilities,
alert evaluation, AI evaluates

83
00:04:53,049 --> 00:04:57,099
incoming alerts based on severity,
context, and potential impact.

84
00:04:57,459 --> 00:04:59,194
Organizing critical threats.

85
00:04:59,694 --> 00:05:04,794
Contextual analysis enriches alerts with
relevant intelligence and environmental

86
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:07,044
context for more informed decision making.

87
00:05:07,764 --> 00:05:11,664
Orchestrated response automates
the executions of predefined

88
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:14,814
playbooks and response procedures
across security systems.

89
00:05:15,174 --> 00:05:19,254
Verification and reporting verifies
the effectiveness of remediation and

90
00:05:19,254 --> 00:05:22,614
provides detailed documentation for
compliance and future improvements.

91
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:27,194
By using all this, AI can prioritize
what critical threats, and based

92
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,724
on that it can take an action.

93
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:30,104
Let's take an example.

94
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:33,794
Imagine you get an alert that an
employee clicked on a suspicious email

95
00:05:34,274 --> 00:05:38,924
instead of manually investigating
ai, quickly analyzes the risk and

96
00:05:38,924 --> 00:05:42,644
either wants the employee or isolate
the issue to prevent the further harm

97
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:45,034
vulnerability management revolution.

98
00:05:45,534 --> 00:05:47,334
Intelligent continuous assessment.

99
00:05:47,604 --> 00:05:52,014
AI moves beyond traditional scanning
using machine learning to evaluate

100
00:05:52,014 --> 00:05:57,894
vulnerabilities based on exploitability
attacker behavior and asset criticality.

101
00:05:58,494 --> 00:06:02,994
Risk-based prioritization, AI
prioritizes remediation efforts based

102
00:06:02,994 --> 00:06:05,244
on actual risk to the organization.

103
00:06:05,784 --> 00:06:11,514
Rather than relying solely on CVSS
scores, faster remediation AI can

104
00:06:11,514 --> 00:06:13,554
recommend or even implement fixes.

105
00:06:13,794 --> 00:06:17,214
Significantly reducing the time
from discovery to resolution.

106
00:06:17,714 --> 00:06:21,104
AI is fundamentally transforming
vulnerability management by

107
00:06:21,104 --> 00:06:25,694
moving beyond simple scanning to
intelligent continuous assessment.

108
00:06:26,144 --> 00:06:29,384
Machine learning algorithms
evaluate vulnerabilities.

109
00:06:29,884 --> 00:06:33,514
This revolutionary approach
prioritizes remediation effects

110
00:06:33,514 --> 00:06:35,614
based on actual risk rather than.

111
00:06:36,049 --> 00:06:40,789
Generic ratings ensuring security
teams focus on what matters most.

112
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:42,489
Let's take an example.

113
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:46,809
Let's say your system has
vulnerability that is only exploitable.

114
00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:49,149
If an attacker is already
inside your network.

115
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:53,949
AI can consider this and tell you to
focus on fixing other vulnerabilities

116
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:59,009
that are more likely to be exploited from
outside automated compliance monitoring.

117
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:03,229
Continuous assessment, real-time
monitoring of systems, configurations

118
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:08,839
against regulate regulatory frameworks
like nist, P-C-I-D-S-S, hipaa, and a

119
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:12,639
SO 27,001 Documentation Generation.

120
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:16,029
Automatic creation of compliance
reports and audit trails,

121
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:19,509
reducing manual documentation
efforts for creation maintenance.

122
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:23,939
Drift detection, immediate
identification of configuration

123
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:27,959
changes that may impact compliance
status and enabling rapid remediation

124
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:32,869
by using automated compliance
monitoring, it is very easy to maintain

125
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,844
our certifications because AI will
take care of all the monitoring

126
00:07:36,844 --> 00:07:40,234
that are necessary and all the
documentation that is necessary

127
00:07:40,234 --> 00:07:41,884
for maintaining the certification.

128
00:07:42,484 --> 00:07:43,624
Let's take an example.

129
00:07:44,044 --> 00:07:47,554
AI works like an automatic compliance
audit that never misses anything.

130
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:51,304
It continuously checks if your
systems are following regulations,

131
00:07:51,544 --> 00:07:54,454
so you don't have to scramble
to prepare when an audit is due.

132
00:07:54,954 --> 00:07:58,509
Threat intelligence, integration,
collection and aggregation,

133
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:02,324
gathering threat data from diverse
sources, including commercial

134
00:08:02,324 --> 00:08:04,514
feeds, open source intelligence.

135
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:08,254
Dark web monitoring
and industry I-S-A-C-S.

136
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,194
Analysis and enrichment.

137
00:08:10,344 --> 00:08:16,074
AI processes raw intelligence to identify
patterns, relevance, and create actionable

138
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:18,324
insights specific to environment.

139
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:22,884
Operational integration, automated
distribution of intelligence to

140
00:08:22,884 --> 00:08:26,694
security controls for proactive
defense across security stacks.

141
00:08:27,194 --> 00:08:32,504
Advanced natural language processing can
analyze unstructured threat data from

142
00:08:32,504 --> 00:08:35,144
security blogs, forms, and social media.

143
00:08:35,174 --> 00:08:38,924
While machine learning algorithms
identify correlation between

144
00:08:39,164 --> 00:08:43,934
seemingly unrelated incidents, the
result is significantly more robust.

145
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:49,004
Defense poster that anticipates
and counters emerging threats.

146
00:08:49,504 --> 00:08:53,234
Let's take feedback and refinement,
continuous evaluation and adjustment

147
00:08:53,234 --> 00:08:56,324
of intelligence parameters
to improve future analysis.

148
00:08:56,774 --> 00:08:57,854
Let's take an example.

149
00:08:58,424 --> 00:09:03,344
If a hacker shakes new shares, a new
exploit tool on a forum, AI can detect

150
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:08,414
it, learn from it, and update security
systems to protect against that specific

151
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,634
tool before it's used in an attack.

152
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,234
Just in time security remediation.

153
00:09:13,774 --> 00:09:18,154
Just in time security remediation
represents a paradigm shift from a

154
00:09:18,154 --> 00:09:22,054
static defense to dynamic protection
measures that adopt in real time.

155
00:09:22,414 --> 00:09:27,064
The approach leverages AI to continuously
evaluate risk and automatically

156
00:09:27,064 --> 00:09:30,694
implement appropriate security
controls precisely when needed.

157
00:09:31,194 --> 00:09:34,884
Dynamic protection shifts from
static defense to adoptive real-time

158
00:09:34,884 --> 00:09:39,014
security measures that continuously
evaluate and respond to risks.

159
00:09:39,074 --> 00:09:43,694
AI driven security AI automatically
implements context aware security

160
00:09:43,694 --> 00:09:47,594
controls precisely when needed,
reducing unnecessary exposure.

161
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:53,474
Reducing attacks surface by moving away
from traditional always on-premise.

162
00:09:53,474 --> 00:09:57,544
Organizations can significantly lower
their attacks surfaces while maintaining

163
00:09:57,544 --> 00:10:00,214
operations efficiency cloud environments.

164
00:10:00,244 --> 00:10:04,534
This approach is especially beneficial
in cloud environments where perimeter

165
00:10:04,534 --> 00:10:06,394
based securities in insufficient.

166
00:10:07,354 --> 00:10:08,404
Let's take an example.

167
00:10:09,244 --> 00:10:11,734
It's like adjusting the
security level in your home.

168
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:14,349
When you are home, you don't need
high security locks everywhere.

169
00:10:14,854 --> 00:10:19,444
But when you are away, AI sets up
strong protections automatically.

170
00:10:19,944 --> 00:10:20,694
Just in time.

171
00:10:20,694 --> 00:10:24,504
Security remediation has three
main components temporary access

172
00:10:24,504 --> 00:10:27,805
controls, adoptive security
boundaries on demand isolation.

173
00:10:28,404 --> 00:10:32,724
By using these things, it'll only
implement when the security is needed,

174
00:10:33,144 --> 00:10:37,764
and other times it can relax so that
systems can perform more effectively.

175
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:40,934
Performance optimization
through AI integrations.

176
00:10:41,414 --> 00:10:47,324
By using AI integration we have, we
can reduce the false positives by 85%.

177
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:54,254
You can respond to incidents by increasing
your speed by 67%, and you can improve

178
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,654
the resource utilization by 73%.

179
00:10:57,154 --> 00:11:01,744
AI driven security solutions significantly
reduce false positives, helping.

180
00:11:02,374 --> 00:11:08,104
Elevate alert fat that often burden
security teams faster response.

181
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,944
Automated orchestration capabilities
have cut incident response time

182
00:11:11,944 --> 00:11:16,084
by over two thirds, enabling
quicker mitigation of threats.

183
00:11:16,194 --> 00:11:21,684
Intelligence, resource allocation, AI
optimizes resource users allowing security

184
00:11:21,684 --> 00:11:24,174
teams to achieve more with existing staff.

185
00:11:24,864 --> 00:11:26,814
Improved security and cost savings.

186
00:11:26,874 --> 00:11:30,684
These efficiency gains result in
stronger security poster and direct

187
00:11:30,684 --> 00:11:32,484
cost savings for organizations.

188
00:11:33,144 --> 00:11:34,164
Let's take an example.

189
00:11:34,164 --> 00:11:37,704
Think of security team constantly
overwhelmed with alerts.

190
00:11:37,794 --> 00:11:42,114
AI filters out unnecessary ones and
help the team focus only on what

191
00:11:42,114 --> 00:11:46,224
really matters, reducing burnout
and improving their effectiveness.

192
00:11:46,724 --> 00:11:49,094
Building your AI cybersecurity roadmap.

193
00:11:49,694 --> 00:11:53,774
Implementing an AI driven cybersecurity
framework requires a strategic

194
00:11:54,074 --> 00:11:57,494
phased approach tailored to your
organization's specific needs.

195
00:11:57,854 --> 00:12:01,394
Begin with the comprehensive assessment
of your current security poster

196
00:12:01,814 --> 00:12:07,264
and clearly define objectives of AI
integration, strategic phase approach.

197
00:12:07,764 --> 00:12:09,504
Begin with the
comprehensive assessment of.

198
00:12:10,134 --> 00:12:13,524
Your current security poster and
define clear objectives of AI

199
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:18,054
integration pilot projects start with
focused AI initiatives, high value

200
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:21,624
areas like phishing detection and
endpoint production to demonstrate

201
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:23,964
early value and build confidence.

202
00:12:24,084 --> 00:12:26,214
Integration not replacement.

203
00:12:26,694 --> 00:12:30,384
Emphasize integrating AI with
existing security tools and

204
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:34,674
practices rather than replacing them
entirely Continuous improvement.

205
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:39,399
Regularly assess the effectiveness
of AI solutions and refine the

206
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,319
approach as technologies mature.

207
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:43,449
Let's take an example.

208
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,519
It's like building a new bridge.

209
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:49,269
First, you need to assess the
land, plan, the design, and then

210
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,039
start with small test sections.

211
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:55,024
Once you've got it right, you
build more and refine the process.

212
00:12:55,524 --> 00:13:00,204
In conclusion, AI plays a critical
role in improving cybersecurity

213
00:13:00,444 --> 00:13:05,214
By making systems smarter and more
responsive, it helps detect threats

214
00:13:05,214 --> 00:13:11,064
faster, respond more efficiently, reduce
human errors, and improve compliance.

215
00:13:11,694 --> 00:13:15,654
AI makes security operations
more efficient and reduces costs

216
00:13:15,654 --> 00:13:18,084
while keeping organizations safe.

217
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:22,934
Just think of an AI as a superpowered
assistant that works 24 by seven,

218
00:13:23,654 --> 00:13:29,414
constantly improving and ensuring your
systems stay ahead of potential threats.

219
00:13:30,194 --> 00:13:30,734
That's all.

220
00:13:30,854 --> 00:13:31,364
