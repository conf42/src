00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,980
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,489
This is Rajesh Kamisetty.

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,660
I am a lead software
engineer at S& P Global.

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,830
I've been with S& P Global for almost
three years now, and I've been in

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:17,539
the data field for almost like 14
years, and my key passion is about

6
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:20,649
using data to create insights.

7
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:26,633
I have been doing this for many years
and for many companies, specifically,

8
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:33,251
in the past, I have worked for, retail
industry like Konagrafus, Cisco Foods,

9
00:00:33,251 --> 00:00:35,081
and pharmaceutical industry as well.

10
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:42,151
now at S& P, I'm a lead data
slash architect or engineer.

11
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:46,791
My main goal is here is to provide
insights for our customers.

12
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:53,306
as most of S& P is a, very big
organization, S& P being said stand and

13
00:00:53,306 --> 00:01:01,906
pull, we do have ETFs, we do have ratings,
we do rate organizations, and, we have,

14
00:01:02,406 --> 00:01:07,896
a group called Market Intelligence,
where we provide data sets to consumers.

15
00:01:08,036 --> 00:01:10,626
So I am a, I am part of that organization.

16
00:01:11,126 --> 00:01:17,846
my role is there to harness
the tons and tons of data and

17
00:01:17,846 --> 00:01:20,276
provide insights to customers.

18
00:01:20,396 --> 00:01:22,526
So that is my main, role there.

19
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:28,966
In this role, my main focus will
be always optimizing, the outputs

20
00:01:29,186 --> 00:01:31,706
and insights provided to customers.

21
00:01:31,806 --> 00:01:37,726
today's topic, is a topic which
everybody Has know about this.

22
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,536
Like autonomous vehicles, right?

23
00:01:39,576 --> 00:01:41,536
Everybody talks about Tesla, right?

24
00:01:41,876 --> 00:01:45,196
So a lot of people, know
Tesla and the car company.

25
00:01:45,196 --> 00:01:51,226
And they, this is the, is in positive
race for the autonomous vehicle race.

26
00:01:51,306 --> 00:01:53,146
With its own future as FSD.

27
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:54,596
fully self driving.

28
00:01:55,056 --> 00:02:02,056
basically, I want you guys to, to give an
idea about how these autonomous vehicles

29
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:10,246
work and in addition to that, how AI
plays a role in autonomous vehicles.

30
00:02:10,486 --> 00:02:16,256
So, I'll explain the basics of
autonomous vehicles, what technology

31
00:02:16,306 --> 00:02:21,866
they use and what is the impact
AI as artificial intelligence,

32
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:27,436
specifically, neural networking
plays a role in autonomous vehicles.

33
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:29,941
So stay buckled.

34
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,701
As I mentioned, we'll be talking
about autonomous vehicles.

35
00:02:32,991 --> 00:02:37,341
My main key area about, my
lecture today would be focusing

36
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:39,311
on the safety side of it.

37
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:42,951
And, these are the few topics
which I will be discussing today.

38
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:47,621
What are the, technologies like
perception systems, which we

39
00:02:47,621 --> 00:02:48,971
use in autonomous vehicles?

40
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:53,781
how is the integration between
sensors and data is handled?

41
00:02:53,781 --> 00:02:53,841
Thank you.

42
00:02:54,506 --> 00:03:00,896
And, just an example of, technologies used
by the companies like Tesla and Waymo.

43
00:03:01,826 --> 00:03:07,026
And then how AI is used in there
to drive the decision making.

44
00:03:07,806 --> 00:03:13,826
And also relate, how the fail safe
mechanism, works and what is the future

45
00:03:13,886 --> 00:03:15,916
path for these, autonomous vehicles.

46
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:21,346
And especially how AI is going to,
shape the autonomous vehicle futures.

47
00:03:21,906 --> 00:03:26,216
And then also we will discuss a little
bit on safety standards and delivery,

48
00:03:27,146 --> 00:03:28,646
and then we'll come to conclusion.

49
00:03:29,146 --> 00:03:33,726
The reason for me being picking
up this topic is, very inclusion

50
00:03:33,726 --> 00:03:38,986
because, the autonomous call vehicles
is pretty much like the driverless,

51
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:46,096
driverless, automated, these softwares
or technologies has, created so much.

52
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:46,111
Uh.

53
00:03:46,611 --> 00:03:48,501
excitement in that, general public.

54
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:54,771
so if you see today, AI is key, a playing
a key role in enhancing the safety

55
00:03:55,221 --> 00:03:56,991
and, the self-driving capabilities.

56
00:03:57,601 --> 00:04:03,211
And also if you look at, the amount
of data, this, that the AI models

57
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:08,401
are crossing or like it can of data.

58
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:16,741
So if you say, As of today, the data
is processed per second is almost 1.

59
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:23,431
5 terabytes, like sensor
data at an hour, for an hour.

60
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:30,711
So basically, the autonomous vehicles
process this sensor data and along

61
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:37,331
with other information, with built in
AI models, they are making decisions.

62
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:39,481
which is an exciting thing.

63
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:46,911
So I just want to dig deeper into this
technology and the key factor which

64
00:04:46,951 --> 00:04:52,341
made me pick this topic is like, what
is the, if you look at the number of

65
00:04:52,341 --> 00:04:57,721
the percentage, the percentage of this
effectiveness is like, for example, if

66
00:04:57,721 --> 00:05:05,176
you see that the numbers say that 37
percent has reduced when after the, in

67
00:05:05,176 --> 00:05:12,916
collisions, 37 percent of collisions got
reduced when compared to human drivers.

68
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:19,396
I'm not saying autonomous vehicles are
best, but it's just a statistical number

69
00:05:19,716 --> 00:05:26,706
where there is a lot of decreasing
collisions when compared to human drivers.

70
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:28,966
so that is the reason I picked this topic.

71
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:33,956
And we'll dig deeper and know more
about what are the technologies and how

72
00:05:33,956 --> 00:05:36,566
these autonom autonomous vehicles work.

73
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:40,456
As I mentioned, we would be
talking about few components

74
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:41,776
of these autonomous vehicles.

75
00:05:42,036 --> 00:05:47,066
So all these component in current
world are integrated with AI and

76
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:48,446
they are providing better results.

77
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:52,636
So the main components in these autonomous
vehicles are like sensor fusion.

78
00:05:52,876 --> 00:05:54,586
So what are the sensor fusions, right?

79
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,326
These are the sensors which are.

80
00:05:57,806 --> 00:06:03,176
assembled across the autonomous
vehicle, which provide a 360 degree,

81
00:06:03,676 --> 00:06:05,596
environment of this autonomous vehicle.

82
00:06:05,956 --> 00:06:10,836
And, and creates an awareness
and maps the vehicle accordingly.

83
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:14,226
So it plays, there are
so many sensors, right?

84
00:06:14,566 --> 00:06:15,556
360 degrees.

85
00:06:15,556 --> 00:06:18,946
We can see hell number of
sensors where this, where all

86
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,506
these sensors are integrated.

87
00:06:20,856 --> 00:06:26,686
And the data is, captured and provided
to the, software in the vehicle and,

88
00:06:27,046 --> 00:06:31,286
and the decision is made, decisions
are made based out of these sensors,

89
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:32,707
what the sensor has captured.

90
00:06:33,077 --> 00:06:34,667
and the other technology is LiDAR.

91
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:37,477
LIDAR stands for Light
Detection and Ranging.

92
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:42,297
It is one of the key, component or like
technology used in autonomous vehicles.

93
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:46,077
Usually what it does is based
out of, what do you call?

94
00:06:46,597 --> 00:06:51,957
It emits laser light, and captures
how far is the vehicle and what is the

95
00:06:51,977 --> 00:06:54,047
depth and all that kind of information.

96
00:06:54,472 --> 00:06:59,262
And it covers 360 degrees and
it does a 128 layer scanning and

97
00:06:59,742 --> 00:07:02,172
its range goes across 250 meters.

98
00:07:02,642 --> 00:07:04,402
And the next piece is like cameras.

99
00:07:04,732 --> 00:07:08,492
So a lot of companies like pretty
much if you talk about Autonomous

100
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:11,432
vehicle the big company we get
into our mind is like tesla.

101
00:07:11,652 --> 00:07:18,042
So tesla mainly relies on cameras So
so they use high end cameras Which like

102
00:07:18,052 --> 00:07:23,022
the sports cameras which capture like
more than 120 frames per second and

103
00:07:23,032 --> 00:07:28,386
all these The high resolution and the,
and the, and high resolution pictures

104
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:35,106
are captured and the neural networks in
the software or the, the software are

105
00:07:35,186 --> 00:07:42,166
captured and, sorry, the neural networks
in the software process this technology,

106
00:07:42,426 --> 00:07:47,176
process, sorry, use it to process these
images and then the decisions are made.

107
00:07:47,516 --> 00:07:49,066
And then the other piece is radars.

108
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:50,636
Radars also play a key role.

109
00:07:50,856 --> 00:07:55,506
So it detects, it detects,
vehicles 300 meters.

110
00:07:55,936 --> 00:07:59,886
And, these are also, these are very
critical for autonomous vehicles.

111
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:05,126
And usually the specs around these
vehicles are like, the specs around

112
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:09,036
these key, Key components are
listed here just for your reference.

113
00:08:09,276 --> 00:08:14,986
So FOV stands for front view and
horizontal scanning is like 360 degrees

114
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:20,846
for the lighter and cameras like for
low light they use infrared and stuff

115
00:08:21,106 --> 00:08:23,926
and radar like 300 meters, accuracy.

116
00:08:24,226 --> 00:08:26,686
The accuracy is like plus or minus 0.

117
00:08:26,686 --> 00:08:28,356
1 meter, which is really great.

118
00:08:28,656 --> 00:08:29,597
And the angle is 0.

119
00:08:29,597 --> 00:08:34,246
1, which is really great when compared
to components we are talking about.

120
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:39,576
Next we'll talk about, the technology,
as we spoke about, the technology,

121
00:08:39,826 --> 00:08:41,886
I'll talk about the companies, right?

122
00:08:42,176 --> 00:08:47,096
When we talk about AVs, the biggest
company we get to get remembered

123
00:08:47,096 --> 00:08:49,396
on, which crosses our mind is Tesla.

124
00:08:49,716 --> 00:08:54,816
specifically talking about Tesla,
it comes to, FSD, full self driving.

125
00:08:55,276 --> 00:08:57,386
And other companies like to buy more.

126
00:08:58,086 --> 00:08:59,466
Uber Mobile.

127
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:02,856
I, but I just pick two examples
here to just give an idea how

128
00:09:02,946 --> 00:09:04,356
Tesla is different from others.

129
00:09:04,596 --> 00:09:08,016
So Tesla is completely a vision
based approach, as I mentioned

130
00:09:08,016 --> 00:09:10,036
in the past, in the prior minute.

131
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:15,486
So it is all about ca capturing the
pictures around the, the vehicle

132
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:20,751
and processing the, the pictures
and, and providing the, output,

133
00:09:20,751 --> 00:09:22,101
like decision making to the.

134
00:09:22,601 --> 00:09:25,481
The driver, sorry, the autonomous vehicle.

135
00:09:25,661 --> 00:09:31,621
and so the main goal of Tesla, Tesla
is okay, how the better the picture

136
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:36,611
quality is and how many pictures
it is taking and how fast it is,

137
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:38,571
processing and providing a decision.

138
00:09:38,831 --> 00:09:41,141
So Tesla has a huge fleet of, vehicles.

139
00:09:41,141 --> 00:09:46,391
So it has so much of bigger data set,
when compared to other, other, other

140
00:09:46,391 --> 00:09:51,511
companies so it has a What I would say
is like upper hand one comparing to

141
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:58,841
them the sample data, very processing
uses the decisions and the main goal

142
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:05,621
for tesla to focus on this is to It also
comes to the cost lighter is a little

143
00:10:05,651 --> 00:10:10,151
bit expensive when compared to cameras
So I think like some people feel okay to

144
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:15,356
save money cost and lighter technology,
Tesla is using more of cameras.

145
00:10:15,536 --> 00:10:17,346
So that's one view of thinking it.

146
00:10:17,526 --> 00:10:22,976
When, when coming to Waymo, Waymo
uses lighter radars and cameras.

147
00:10:23,266 --> 00:10:27,276
I think a lot of people have seen
the Waymo cars on the streets.

148
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:33,886
It's like a, on the top there is a some
kind of a slider running across and

149
00:10:33,886 --> 00:10:39,861
there are a couple of cameras by the Two
doors and a lot of stuff around the car.

150
00:10:39,911 --> 00:10:46,031
so what lidar, what ymo is like,
it uses lidar, it rare, it uses

151
00:10:46,031 --> 00:10:50,671
radars and uses cameras to create
a comprehensive perceptive system.

152
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:56,491
And based on this, it has, it defines
it, it creates a high definition map,

153
00:10:56,971 --> 00:10:59,371
and then precise vehicle position.

154
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:05,331
So with this campaign, with machine
learning and ai, It gives, it

155
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,901
gives a better driving experience.

156
00:11:07,121 --> 00:11:13,631
So many people know that YMO is not fully
used in the market, but yeah, what I would

157
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:19,051
say is it's also in, it's also, getting,
trying to getting on par with SSD.

158
00:11:19,551 --> 00:11:25,011
If you look at the stats, like this amount
of data, which is being processed by

159
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,301
this, I would say that vehicle is amazing.

160
00:11:27,651 --> 00:11:31,291
For example, the neural networks
which are being built to serve the

161
00:11:31,381 --> 00:11:36,641
autonomous vehicle process almost
250, 000 scenarios per iteration.

162
00:11:36,921 --> 00:11:42,521
And the vehicle detection as of
today, as per 98 percent accuracy.

163
00:11:43,061 --> 00:11:44,581
Pedestrian detection is 95%.

164
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:49,981
There is a little bit of, Less
detection when compared to, vehicles

165
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:54,061
to pedestrians because pedestrians
are moving objects like moving people.

166
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:58,261
So they come, they may suddenly cross the
street or they suddenly pop in between.

167
00:11:58,411 --> 00:12:02,101
So that is the reason I guess,
there is a little bit less accuracy

168
00:12:02,211 --> 00:12:03,061
when compared to pedestrians.

169
00:12:03,061 --> 00:12:07,013
And if you look at the response
time, it is 300 milliseconds,

170
00:12:07,013 --> 00:12:08,441
which is really great.

171
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:13,721
And, which is really 500
percent or like 250 percent more

172
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:15,581
than what regular humans did.

173
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:19,631
So if you're a regular human, you're
driving, if somebody, if the average

174
00:12:19,701 --> 00:12:21,721
response time is 1, 500 milliseconds.

175
00:12:22,131 --> 00:12:27,571
But the autonomous vehicles like Tesla
or Vimo or whatever, Uber or Mobile line.

176
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:31,371
So all these companies, their
response time is Approximately

177
00:12:31,371 --> 00:12:33,201
around 300 milliseconds.

178
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:39,911
So that's one key factor, which make me
feel like this is an exciting technology.

179
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:45,256
as I said in the, in first
few minutes, the, there is a

180
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:51,691
reduction in the collisions when
compared to humans than Aries.

181
00:12:52,026 --> 00:12:54,186
So that this is the main reason, right?

182
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:58,071
So it's all about reaction time when
you're driving a car or any vehicle.

183
00:12:58,691 --> 00:13:02,851
So how fast you react is what it is,
which saves you from the collision.

184
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:09,601
And then it's always, having the data
fed and keep on processing the data

185
00:13:09,911 --> 00:13:15,601
and the data, if you see, it has 50,
000 hours of data and it process all

186
00:13:15,611 --> 00:13:17,841
this data for enhanced safety futures.

187
00:13:18,341 --> 00:13:23,081
And here are some of the stats, to prove
this technology is a viable technology

188
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:25,661
and, It has a clear path forward.

189
00:13:25,891 --> 00:13:29,911
So if you see, as I mentioned in
the past, 37 percent reduction

190
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:32,571
when compared to human drivers.

191
00:13:32,941 --> 00:13:35,361
Pedestrian safety, 90
percent effectiveness.

192
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:39,201
Detection accuracy is 98 95%.

193
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:42,831
And reliability is like top notch, 99.

194
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:43,501
99%.

195
00:13:43,941 --> 00:13:47,891
and if you see at the meantime
between failures, MTBF, it's a stat

196
00:13:47,931 --> 00:13:50,051
where how often the system fails.

197
00:13:50,091 --> 00:13:52,171
It's like 50, 000 hours.

198
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:57,061
so it is very, it's very, as I
said, it's an intrusive technology.

199
00:13:57,431 --> 00:14:02,891
So I see there is a future going to
be very bright in autonomous vehicles.

200
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:05,661
So as I mentioned, what
is the future, right?

201
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:07,651
So how do we improve safety?

202
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:10,431
how do we bring that 100%?

203
00:14:11,011 --> 00:14:13,896
Nothing will be 100 percent for
sure, but how do we bring that 100%?

204
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,136
safety as much as possible.

205
00:14:16,326 --> 00:14:20,636
So how AI artificial intelligence
is helping this is if you look at

206
00:14:20,636 --> 00:14:22,556
this, neural processing units, right?

207
00:14:22,586 --> 00:14:27,016
As of today, we are close to 1000
tops, terra operations per second.

208
00:14:27,236 --> 00:14:28,106
which is really good.

209
00:14:28,386 --> 00:14:34,996
And, and these, these number of
operations, makes, the output, like to

210
00:14:34,996 --> 00:14:39,926
say, this shall pass it by the A modems
be very, accurate as much as possible.

211
00:14:40,351 --> 00:14:45,191
Another thing is like the latency between
the communication between sensors or

212
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:49,371
cameras are being decreased and we are
looking at five milliseconds of latency.

213
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:53,861
Then when compared to, what you call
the reaction time of humans, which

214
00:14:53,861 --> 00:14:56,081
is like almost 1500 milliseconds.

215
00:14:56,431 --> 00:15:00,921
But, as we mentioned in the prior,
the reaction time of autonomous

216
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:03,131
vehicles is about 300 milliseconds.

217
00:15:03,131 --> 00:15:03,261
Okay.

218
00:15:03,721 --> 00:15:07,461
the more the latency, the
more problem we are in.

219
00:15:07,891 --> 00:15:12,121
the main goal for the autonomous
vehicles, when they are collecting

220
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:16,121
data, when they are passing the
information, for communication to

221
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:20,571
rest of the ecosystem in autonomous
vehicle, is trying to be reduced.

222
00:15:20,581 --> 00:15:25,151
today they are at, they are aiming
to get to 5 milliseconds or less.

223
00:15:25,681 --> 00:15:29,751
And the other thing is like with neural
networks, AI, machine learning, and

224
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:34,621
quantum computing, which is like the
next gen of computing, will improve all

225
00:15:34,621 --> 00:15:36,931
these processing and make it better.

226
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:41,121
And then, with the more amount
of data it is collecting every

227
00:15:41,161 --> 00:15:44,581
day, these vehicles roam across
and collect all this data, right?

228
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:49,501
And you are increasing data,
your data sample, enormously.

229
00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:56,141
So It will continuously, what you call,
feedback mechanism is there so that your

230
00:15:56,221 --> 00:16:01,751
algorithms are trained very well and they
are designed and deployed very well so

231
00:16:01,751 --> 00:16:06,671
that the decisions which are made by the
autonomous vehicles are close to accurate.

232
00:16:07,111 --> 00:16:14,451
And many people, there are some scenarios
where people think about like, how do you

233
00:16:14,461 --> 00:16:19,431
react when it comes to, so if there is a
scenario where this vehicle is to, to a

234
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:21,541
collision with a pedestrian or other car.

235
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:24,771
So these are the ethical
concerns which people have.

236
00:16:25,141 --> 00:16:31,581
But eventually, once, once the technology
is fully approved and completely used,

237
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:38,481
we will see where that ethical concern,
how that ethical concern is handled.

238
00:16:38,991 --> 00:16:42,201
But I am not going to talk
about the ethical concerns.

239
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,711
But we are just talking
about the technologies here.

240
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:51,201
So as we talked about ethics a little bit,
there are also safety concerns, standards,

241
00:16:51,451 --> 00:16:53,351
and compliance and regulatory, right?

242
00:16:53,351 --> 00:16:57,151
So there are a couple of few of the
regulators which are in place to

243
00:16:57,361 --> 00:16:58,761
make sure they are compliant with.

244
00:16:58,761 --> 00:17:03,801
So for example, ISO 26262 compliance
with functional safety standards,

245
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:07,661
that is, which defines how compliant
they should be, and there is also,

246
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:11,211
clarity of the client vultures
and something called SOTAR.

247
00:17:11,616 --> 00:17:15,686
guaranteeing safety under operational
conditions, and these are a few

248
00:17:15,726 --> 00:17:20,296
organizations which try to impose,
some kind of complaints and regulatory

249
00:17:20,466 --> 00:17:26,133
things, and there are also protocols,
how many miles of real world driving

250
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:30,776
this autonomous vehicle has done, how
many simulations, like what kind of,

251
00:17:30,836 --> 00:17:34,466
Simulations it's went through and how
many edge case scenarios it went through,

252
00:17:34,856 --> 00:17:37,836
covering like adverse, adverse terrains.

253
00:17:38,106 --> 00:17:42,446
It could be snow, fog, or
rain, or hail, or whatnot.

254
00:17:42,876 --> 00:17:49,286
And the other metrics which they
key focuses on, like, how far the

255
00:17:49,296 --> 00:17:52,386
radar is detecting, what is the
latency, as I mentioned, right?

256
00:17:52,736 --> 00:17:56,356
The latency at an average of 300
milliseconds, but they substantiate

257
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:59,366
they're trying to get to 100
milliseconds and reliability.

258
00:17:59,921 --> 00:18:02,181
Like what will happen if
the system gives up on me.

259
00:18:02,201 --> 00:18:03,501
So that is very important, right?

260
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:08,391
You cannot go stuck in the middle of
the road So the reliability should

261
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:09,431
end up time should be almost 99.

262
00:18:09,431 --> 00:18:14,211
99 percent Which is close to 100
percent once that is achieved.

263
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:19,491
I feel like if these three metrics like
if you get to 100 million 100 millisecond

264
00:18:19,491 --> 00:18:24,491
latency, that's a big achievement And
reliability close to 100 percent is also

265
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:31,626
achievement and currently, governments
are following, I see there is a good path

266
00:18:32,116 --> 00:18:34,116
going forward towards autonomous vehicles.

267
00:18:34,306 --> 00:18:37,926
So, we can see much more
development in next few years.

268
00:18:38,426 --> 00:18:44,036
In coming to conclusion, I just,
I want to mention the fact that

269
00:18:44,176 --> 00:18:46,506
AI is helping autonomous vehicles.

270
00:18:47,006 --> 00:18:48,676
Like crazy.

271
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:54,116
So AI is driving autonomous
vehicles to achieve what it

272
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:55,556
is supposed to intend to do.

273
00:18:55,956 --> 00:19:01,306
So if you look at the significant
strides, by improving safety, reducing

274
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,056
collision, identifying pedestrians.

275
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:06,486
AI plays a key role in this.

276
00:19:06,826 --> 00:19:07,976
especially neural networks.

277
00:19:08,686 --> 00:19:13,726
very process like closely to thousand
tops of data, and vehicle to vehicle

278
00:19:13,726 --> 00:19:17,566
communication, bringing the latency
to do less than five milliseconds

279
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:25,616
and making sure the reliability, 99%,
99.9% of the key, key concepts of the

280
00:19:25,616 --> 00:19:28,306
success for the autonomous vehicles.

281
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:35,826
So hopefully we will get there and
probably within few years we need not

282
00:19:35,886 --> 00:19:37,886
drive anymore and just sit and relax.

283
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:39,476
Thank you very much.
