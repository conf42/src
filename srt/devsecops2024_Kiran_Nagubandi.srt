00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,030
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:07,449
I welcome you all for the
conference 42 DevSecOps 2024.

3
00:00:07,949 --> 00:00:09,260
My name is Kiran Nagubandi.

4
00:00:09,959 --> 00:00:13,639
I'm glad to be here to discuss
with you all about navigating

5
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,750
security in subscription economy.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,290
I'll be discussing about
strategies, metrics, and

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,790
compliance for sustainable growth.

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,030
My background and experience as an
enterprise and or a solution architect

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,000
in this area really helped me to
contribute this knowledge to the industry.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,760
This session dwells into actionable
strategies for subscription based

11
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,730
businesses to navigate the related
challenges effectively while

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,770
fostering innovation and growth.

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,960
Join me to explore how to stay
ahead in security and compliance.

14
00:00:47,385 --> 00:00:51,645
While capitalizing on the subscription
boom, I hope to see you all enjoy the

15
00:00:51,645 --> 00:00:55,995
session and walk away with some good
knowledge after this talk, some key

16
00:00:55,995 --> 00:01:02,295
topics, which I'm going to be covering
or discussing in today's session are,

17
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:07,265
which are related to, an introduction
to the subscription economy while,

18
00:01:07,365 --> 00:01:09,785
why security and compliance matters.

19
00:01:10,285 --> 00:01:12,335
What are the regulatory
compliance essentials?

20
00:01:12,835 --> 00:01:18,825
strengthening cyber security payment,
enhancing customer trust, educating

21
00:01:18,865 --> 00:01:21,875
customers or consumers on the security.

22
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:25,495
And then we'll be discussing
some key takeaways at the last

23
00:01:25,735 --> 00:01:28,825
and also we'll do, we'll end the
session with a small conclusion.

24
00:01:29,325 --> 00:01:34,385
Let's talk about the next slide,
which is about introduction

25
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,215
to the subscription economy.

26
00:01:36,715 --> 00:01:41,905
In the age of digitalization, many
companies are under increased pressure

27
00:01:42,555 --> 00:01:47,385
to change due to product complexity,
growing customer requirements,

28
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:50,195
and digital business models.

29
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:55,965
The increasing digitalization of
processes and the products has opened

30
00:01:55,965 --> 00:02:01,490
up numerous opportunities for the
companies to exploit the resulting

31
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,829
potential for value creation.

32
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:07,279
And the resultant is the
subscription based businesses.

33
00:02:08,109 --> 00:02:12,689
Now to understand on a high level,
what is a subscription based business?

34
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:16,119
Subscription business is a new
form of business model in many

35
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:21,539
industries, which is like a, this is
a business model where customers pay

36
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:27,549
a recurring fee to access a product
or a service for a specific period.

37
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:33,059
So organizations aims to continuously
increase customer benefit.

38
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,419
to align the interests of
both companies and customers.

39
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,869
This can only be achieved by a
permanent data exchange or a database

40
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:48,309
learning about the customer behavior
and the transfer into, into continuous

41
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:50,739
innovations to increase customer value.

42
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:56,969
And all these efforts, are very
much needed and will be done, in the

43
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,849
subscription based business models.

44
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:05,139
And due to this fact, subscription
based businesses, helps to make

45
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:11,169
industry four times profitable what
they are making in a non traditional

46
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:13,119
model or a traditional model.

47
00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:14,949
Now, if you look at the statistics.

48
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:20,469
Due to this, because of these initiatives
that companies are driving towards moving

49
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:24,329
to the subscription based businesses,
the subscription economy has grown

50
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,739
over by 435 percent in the last decade.

51
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,960
And and these are driven by shifts towards
convenient and personalized services.

52
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,610
If you look at the market potential,
it is expected to reach 1.

53
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,110
5 trillion by 2025.

54
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:45,820
Spanning industries like a SaaS or
e commerce, media and healthcare.

55
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:52,470
So it can be like a SaaS can be
like a industry like a software

56
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,330
as a service or e commerce.

57
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,370
e commerce can be like a, any subscription
based models can be included there.

58
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,070
But in order to, for the
companies in order to achieve

59
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,470
this, there are challenges too.

60
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,980
These are the emerging challenges.

61
00:04:07,095 --> 00:04:11,405
which includes, increasing cost
consumer expectations for the data

62
00:04:11,405 --> 00:04:15,765
privacy because they'll be keep on,
there will be a constant exchange of

63
00:04:15,785 --> 00:04:20,095
information between the consumer and
the systems of the company who is

64
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,775
doing the subscription based models.

65
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:25,325
you're growing complexity in the
global regulatory compliance.

66
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:30,475
And then you're raising cybersecurity
threats with subscription platforms,

67
00:04:30,825 --> 00:04:32,895
which are handing more sensitive data.

68
00:04:33,165 --> 00:04:39,575
these are very much, need to be addressed
by all the companies who are moving

69
00:04:39,575 --> 00:04:41,095
towards subscription based model.

70
00:04:41,754 --> 00:04:46,004
so we will be going, discussing
more in detail, next slides.

71
00:04:46,624 --> 00:04:48,635
Let's look at the next slide,

72
00:04:49,094 --> 00:04:53,664
why, let's look at why security
and compliance matters.

73
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:59,024
Security and compliance are the pillars
of a successful subscription business.

74
00:04:59,524 --> 00:05:03,084
Nowadays, the machines and plans
are connected to the internet

75
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:07,054
and they exchange large amounts
of data, which has resulted in a

76
00:05:07,054 --> 00:05:09,564
critical information security risk.

77
00:05:10,064 --> 00:05:14,574
Whenever there is a loss of knowledge
and control, or whenever there is a data

78
00:05:14,574 --> 00:05:20,234
misuse or any kind of a manipulation of
the transactions of the production data

79
00:05:20,564 --> 00:05:24,864
in the context of subscription, in the, in
the context of subscription transactions.

80
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:29,474
They are really particularly at a high
risk and complimentary to direct and

81
00:05:29,474 --> 00:05:34,014
obvious consequences such as loss of
production, the attacks are increasingly

82
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:38,584
shifting to non transparents and creeping
impairments of production or product

83
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:44,094
quality, which are only apparent at a late
stage or the influencing of payment flows.

84
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:49,794
A transparent presentation of possible
risks and their scope as well as their

85
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:52,134
interrelationship does not exist.

86
00:05:52,634 --> 00:05:58,054
Nowadays, on an average, approximately
62 percent of customers express privacy

87
00:05:58,054 --> 00:06:03,934
concerns, and 54 percent are likely to
cancel subscriptions after a data breach.

88
00:06:04,434 --> 00:06:08,344
Regulatory noncompliance has
resulted in fines exceeding 1 billion

89
00:06:08,344 --> 00:06:09,894
globally in the past two years.

90
00:06:10,394 --> 00:06:15,704
Benefits of prioritizing security and
compliance includes, will certainly

91
00:06:15,724 --> 00:06:17,779
win the customer trust and loyalty.

92
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:22,799
And it enhances if it's already
there and then reduces the risk

93
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,029
of fines and reputational damages.

94
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:29,839
If you go to the next one, which is
a regulatory compliance essentials.

95
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:34,024
Regulatory compliance is the
cornerstone of subscription security.

96
00:06:34,654 --> 00:06:38,844
With laws like General Data Protection
and Regulation, which is nothing

97
00:06:38,844 --> 00:06:43,394
but GDPR, which is based out of
the European Union, and California

98
00:06:43,424 --> 00:06:45,554
Consumer Protection Act, CCPA in the U.

99
00:06:45,554 --> 00:06:48,514
S., these are basically
governing the data protection.

100
00:06:49,014 --> 00:06:51,204
With 62 percent of consumers.

101
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:56,729
Expressing privacy concerns, companies
aligning with these frameworks and

102
00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:00,749
the industry standards such as payment
card industry data security standards,

103
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:06,479
which is PCI DSS, is essential to
mitigate risks and build trust.

104
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:10,840
If you want to understand on a high
level, what is GDPR does, they do a,

105
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,570
like a data protection principles,
they deal with consent management

106
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,080
and then breach, notification rules.

107
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:22,985
And if you look at the CCPA, that they
are into, they deal with the transference

108
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:28,755
in the data handling, deletion
requests, and opt out rights, PCI DSS.

109
00:07:28,755 --> 00:07:32,175
They are for securing handling,
secure handling of the payment

110
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,095
data to protect against fraud.

111
00:07:34,595 --> 00:07:39,965
So the practical tips for compliance
includes regular audits and updates

112
00:07:39,965 --> 00:07:44,065
to align with changing laws,
appointing a data protection officer.

113
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,470
Transparent privacy policies and the
consent forms will certainly mitigate

114
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,670
the risk of this particular, global,
regulatory compliance and essentials.

115
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,770
Let's talk about strengthening
the cybersecurity.

116
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:03,270
The subscription business's success
hinges on addressing critical,

117
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,310
security and compliance challenges.

118
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,420
to maintain customer trust
and protect sensitive data.

119
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,570
The structure of subscription
models and their different

120
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:19,550
manifestations based on their risk
vulnerabilities are characterized.

121
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:26,120
This allows, suitable cyber security
measure to be taken at every early stage.

122
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,920
From this basis, companies can secure
existing or planned subscription business

123
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,060
models, and thus strengthen the trust
of business partners and customers.

124
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,470
Now, how do you build
robust cyber defenses?

125
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:45,710
Now, the key cybersecurity measures
include encryption of the customer data at

126
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:51,670
rest and in transit, regular penetration
testing to identify vulnerabilities,

127
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:57,885
Use of AI driven threat detection
systems to preempt cyber attacks.

128
00:08:58,385 --> 00:09:03,085
Now these data points could help
companies to consider the needed

129
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:06,905
measures like 30 percent of the reduction
in security incidents for companies

130
00:09:06,905 --> 00:09:09,195
adopting AI powered defenses in 2023.

131
00:09:09,695 --> 00:09:11,865
The average cost of data breach is 4.

132
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:17,925
45 million in 2023, making a
prevention as a critical investment.

133
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:21,825
these data points are not sufficient
for the companies to consider

134
00:09:21,855 --> 00:09:25,145
that these are, these costs
compared to, the implementation

135
00:09:25,145 --> 00:09:26,615
costs are pretty, pretty low.

136
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:30,315
So companies can really go for
it to save themselves from the

137
00:09:30,335 --> 00:09:34,475
potential attacks and also improve
their goodwill among the customers.

138
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:39,725
The pro, some of the proactive steps
also include employee training to

139
00:09:39,755 --> 00:09:41,385
recognize phishing and other threats.

140
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,900
And then also some of the things
like implementing multi factor

141
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,850
authentication for all access points.

142
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:59,890
Now, if you look at the securing
payments, securing payment solutions

143
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:06,020
also, they also play a pivotal role
as over 50 percent of the subscription

144
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,700
payments are now automated.

145
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,150
Supporting authentication methods
like 3d secure and adhering to the

146
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:18,340
payment card industry Data security
standards, which is PCI DSS, which I

147
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,530
have already discussed in my earlier
slide You know these standards ensure

148
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:27,950
both fraud prevention and a seamless
user experience Additionally providing

149
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:33,065
transparent and easy cancellation
mechanisms is not only a regulatory

150
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:38,735
necessity, but also a driver for customer
loyalty with 32 percent of subscribers

151
00:10:38,865 --> 00:10:40,815
valuing hazard free cancellations.

152
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:45,225
Companies has to ensure safe
and seamless payment processing.

153
00:10:45,815 --> 00:10:50,285
Key challenges in payment security
include handling auto payments

154
00:10:50,285 --> 00:10:55,525
across multiple geographies,
payment preventing fraud while

155
00:10:55,545 --> 00:10:56,965
maintaining a seamless user interface.

156
00:10:57,585 --> 00:10:58,515
experiences.

157
00:10:59,315 --> 00:11:03,285
now there are solutions where, which can
be implemented to prevent these challenges

158
00:11:03,285 --> 00:11:07,415
or overcome these challenges, which is
complying with the PCI DSS to prevent

159
00:11:07,425 --> 00:11:13,245
sensitive cardholder data or implement 3d
secure protocols, which add an additional

160
00:11:13,245 --> 00:11:16,145
authentication layer for online payments.

161
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:20,575
You can also partner with secure payment
gateways that support fraud detection.

162
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,620
And also, some of the key data points
to support these solutions, which

163
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,380
could motivate the companies to go
with these solutions is like security

164
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,670
companies who are following security
payment system process or, you know,

165
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,640
process they, these secure systems
in today's world process over 50

166
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,880
percent of subscription transactions,
ensuring compliance and consumer trust.

167
00:11:41,965 --> 00:11:43,304
