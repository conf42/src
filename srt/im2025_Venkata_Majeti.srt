1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:00,800
Hi.

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,679
Yeah, thanks for joining
the conference 42.

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:10,390
My name is Il Kumar Mati, working
as a product owner at Salesforce.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,710
I did my masters from National
Institute of Technology at Warangal.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,250
Today I'm going to present a topic
on AI driven incident resilience.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:26,130
Scaling subscription systems in the $400
billion economy without losing uptime.

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,130
And as for today's endeavor, we
are discussing ERA four topics,

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:39,210
subscription economy, landscape, AI
driven incident detection, architectural

9
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,035
foundations, revenue protection
strategies, implementation roadmap.

10
00:00:44,535 --> 00:00:51,075
So when it comes to subscription
economy landscape, that may go to the,

11
00:00:51,915 --> 00:00:58,004
it's a $400 billion opportunity, which
has a market size of 400 billion.

12
00:00:58,155 --> 00:01:02,945
The current valuation of the global
subscription economy, it's growing

13
00:01:02,945 --> 00:01:10,000
at a faster rate of 18.2% per Ann and
component annual growth rate since 2018.

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,800
The main focus is on the digital services.

15
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:19,170
The percentage of growth is
driven by these digital services.

16
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,480
The shift represents a fundamental
change in how business delivers

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,040
value and greater revenue.

18
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,785
The scale of the enterprise
reliability is, harm is now directly

19
00:01:29,785 --> 00:01:34,915
tied to revenue retention, so
revenue retention is important.

20
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:41,715
When considering, along with the
incident management systems, though

21
00:01:41,745 --> 00:01:47,295
the cost of downtime in subscription
businesses beyond immediate revenue

22
00:01:47,295 --> 00:01:54,035
loss, apart from the revenue loss, there
are other impacts that focus on the

23
00:01:54,035 --> 00:01:56,885
importance of doing the AI driven system.

24
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:02,365
The average enterprise size company
lost 300 K per hour of downtime.

25
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:09,735
With this downtime, it impact of is more
and customer acquisition cost wasted

26
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:17,195
when new users and counter error and
15 to 35% higher shun rates following

27
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,605
significant service disruptions.

28
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:23,425
Brand reputation damage requiring
six to 12 months to fully recover.

29
00:02:24,355 --> 00:02:29,485
So to recover a brand name, the
brand, the marketing, and all, it

30
00:02:29,485 --> 00:02:31,945
takes around a year to fully recover.

31
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:38,195
So to avoid this, the reliability
paradox, so we can say what

32
00:02:38,255 --> 00:02:41,285
factors affecting the reliability.

33
00:02:41,785 --> 00:02:43,855
So growth demands innovation.

34
00:02:44,355 --> 00:02:47,995
To get the growth we need A
innovation is required to excel.

35
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:55,045
So subscription business must continuously
apply new features to remind competi to

36
00:02:55,045 --> 00:02:58,525
and meet evolving customer expectations.

37
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:05,075
Without the new features, you can't grow
faster and compete with other competitors.

38
00:03:05,575 --> 00:03:08,785
So innovation is a must to grow.

39
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:12,295
And innovation introduces risk.

40
00:03:13,195 --> 00:03:14,905
When you're innovating something.

41
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:18,535
The risk will also add
with the new innovations.

42
00:03:19,225 --> 00:03:25,010
So each deployment integration and feature
adoption, it's potential failure points

43
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,465
in increasing complex systems is based
on the complex system, the new features.

44
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:36,590
The new integrations will increase the
failure points and comes to reliability,

45
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,670
require stability to get it more reliable.

46
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,170
The stability is a key.

47
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:47,230
Maintaining near feature uptime,
perfect uptime traditionally meant

48
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:53,960
slowing release cycles and limited
changes, so we try to reliability to

49
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,060
increase the reliability and stability.

50
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,170
We need a perfect up time and slowing
release cycles and limited changes.

51
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,070
So there is a tension between the
innovation and stability Created

52
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,410
impossible choice for engineering leaders.

53
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,890
Now, AI driving instant resilience
emerged as a solution that enables both

54
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,200
rapid evolution and robust reliability.

55
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,830
So this AI driven solution will help.

56
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,320
The robust.

57
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,270
So it gives the robust reliability.

58
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,960
That's what we are focusing
on with the AI reliability.

59
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:35,450
And comes to the second topic, the AI
drive, incident detection, the new parum.

60
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:43,600
So we going to, to the AI as a predictive
morals, so from reactor to predictive.

61
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,660
As of now, the traditional instant
management relies on monitoring predefined

62
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,330
threshold and metrics like log time, call
time durations, so detecting problems

63
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,250
only after they are impacted users.

64
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:03,030
We are getting the metrics or KPIs
after the users are getting impacted

65
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,930
that AI transforms this approach by
learning normal behavior patterns.

66
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:14,195
Yeah, we can we can understand
the behavior of millions of system

67
00:05:14,195 --> 00:05:21,535
transactions by analyzing the behavior
of the patterns, detecting septal

68
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,175
anomalies that human operators would miss.

69
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:25,035
Yeah.

70
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:30,195
Can find those septal anomalies
where human can't find it, and

71
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:32,205
predicting potential failures.

72
00:05:32,705 --> 00:05:36,725
Ai, you'll predict the failures before
it is cascaded into major incidents,

73
00:05:37,225 --> 00:05:42,565
continuously improving through feedback
loops and outcome analysis, feed

74
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:49,515
feedback loops like the ai trained
systems with the feedback responses,

75
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:51,885
and it'll give a better outcome.

76
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,125
Let me go to the next topic.

77
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:59,330
Architectural foundations of
resilient subscription platforms.

78
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:04,610
So it main focuses on
distributed arc processing.

79
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:09,920
This architecture lines the
foundation for distributor processing.

80
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:15,310
So how region is scalable, microservices
with intelligent load balancing

81
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,170
and regional failure capabilities.

82
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:23,700
Intelligent load balancing through the
traffic to the different microservices

83
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,950
in the highly scalable environments.

84
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:32,150
And data streaming real time event
processing with buffering and

85
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:39,320
replay capabilities to prevent data
laws during incidents or outages.

86
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,840
So data streaming with even
crossing and a sufficient buffer.

87
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:51,570
We won't lose the downtime and we
will get the required data even

88
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:57,650
during the loss of during incidents
and multi-region resilience.

89
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:03,010
So this one Act two diplomat models
with automatic traffic shifting

90
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,040
during regional incidents, like one
region has an incident, it'll route

91
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,290
to the traffic to another region.

92
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:16,960
So it'll provide better region
resilience and stateful recovery.

93
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:22,920
Stateful recovery is transaction and
session management with automated

94
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,380
recovery from partial failures.

95
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,030
So the stateful recovery is the failures.

96
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:33,620
Some of the failures which can
be recovered without any manual

97
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,080
intervention or human intelligence.

98
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:39,665
CI can recover partially.

99
00:07:40,165 --> 00:07:44,875
So these architectural components, these
four components work together to ensure

100
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:50,245
that even during incident response, the
customer experience reminds minimally

101
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:53,385
impacted with near continuous of time.

102
00:07:53,885 --> 00:07:56,980
Continuous of time is
minimizing the downtime.

103
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,470
Yeah, and intelligent storage
and retrieval systems.

104
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:07,150
These storage systems will minimize
the latency even during incidents.

105
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,740
Latency is like the time
the response is taken.

106
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,130
It'll minimize the latency.

107
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:18,660
The intelligent storage systems
and retrieval systems will minimize

108
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,100
the latency during incident.

109
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,460
So the one storage and retro
systems are critical to maintain

110
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,170
performance during incidents.

111
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:33,020
So these systems are critical to maintain
the performance when any incident happen.

112
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,150
So predict to caching.

113
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:40,430
So it'll predict how much what
to be cached that pre positions

114
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,900
frequently access the data.

115
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,260
So the frequently access
data will be cached.

116
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,720
Based on usage patterns and
intelligent data, tiring that balances

117
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,150
performance needs with storage cost.

118
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,130
The data tiring needs, which level
of data we to store is balancing the

119
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:04,250
performance when it getting accessed,
and which will reduce the storage cost.

120
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:08,360
The foster response
requires more storage costs.

121
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:15,250
Like RAM hardware, so the intelligent
data tiring is like that, and red

122
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:20,770
replicas that scale horizontally
to handle traffic spikes.

123
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,260
And so the red replicas is made
commonly used with data by multiple

124
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:33,570
millions of users that can scale
HORR to handle traffic spikes, which

125
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,610
distributed to multiple systems.

126
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:40,955
The graceful degradation that
prioritizes core functionality

127
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,935
during resource constraints.

128
00:09:43,435 --> 00:09:48,525
So this one is the priority goes
to the core functionality and that

129
00:09:49,105 --> 00:09:54,655
during resource constraints it'll
benefit in improving the latency.

130
00:09:55,155 --> 00:10:01,035
And this is the metrics, the leading
platform, 2 99 0.99% availability

131
00:10:01,455 --> 00:10:08,295
for read operations, even during
significant backend incidents, ensuring

132
00:10:08,295 --> 00:10:10,935
users can still access their content.

133
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:11,510
Yeah,

134
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,140
so the beyond detection.

135
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,750
Not only detect the problems
incident management, but building

136
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,310
revenue protection, it'll help in
building the revenue protection.

137
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,040
So AI stands beyond incident
management to actively protect

138
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,950
revenue streams without any outages.

139
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,520
Customer satisfaction, churn production.

140
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,610
So let me go to the next topic on this.

141
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,160
Adapt to churn models.

142
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,084
Retention during incidents.

143
00:10:44,584 --> 00:10:50,224
So add one, subscription businesses
are implementing aid Raven Retention

144
00:10:50,224 --> 00:10:55,504
Systems that specifically target risk
customers during and after incident

145
00:10:56,224 --> 00:11:02,234
Windows Risk customers are like, which
are sent due to the customer experience.

146
00:11:02,734 --> 00:11:03,724
And these are.

147
00:11:04,224 --> 00:11:06,444
VL evaluated using impact scoring.

148
00:11:06,944 --> 00:11:10,844
It'll real time assessment of how
instant effects specific user segment

149
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:14,584
based on their interaction patterns.

150
00:11:15,084 --> 00:11:19,774
Proactive engagement, so how it is
automatically personalized routers to

151
00:11:19,774 --> 00:11:26,064
effect users with appropriate contest
and compensation recovery monitoring.

152
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:32,279
Tracking post incident usage
patterns to identify users showing

153
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:39,239
disengagement signals so that
these three help in retention.

154
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:47,259
The customers during incidents or
like scoring how at what segments

155
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:53,649
of data users are getting impacted
and how we engage the users.

156
00:11:54,149 --> 00:12:02,299
How we can monitor them back after
incident and see how the user behavior,

157
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:09,539
so the engagement signals helps in
retention during incidents, how we

158
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:14,814
can retain returning the customer
using these models that help.

159
00:12:15,229 --> 00:12:22,389
To improve the user experience or user
customer satisfaction after incidents,

160
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:25,529
AI enabled personalization frameworks.

161
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:32,734
So AI is using these frameworks to better
improve the incident management and

162
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:35,814
revenue model, user behavior analysis.

163
00:12:36,314 --> 00:12:42,734
So in this it's continuously monitor
of interaction patterns, content

164
00:12:42,734 --> 00:12:48,484
preferences, and uses usage frequency,
how frequently they use the same data.

165
00:12:48,744 --> 00:12:51,144
What is the preference of using the data?

166
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:56,304
So this user behavior analysis
is the key part in the framework

167
00:12:57,114 --> 00:12:59,634
and dynamic segmentation.

168
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:03,534
So this is like on a real time basis.

169
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:05,724
Classification based on behavior.

170
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:11,804
So this is dynamically classifying
the behavior of the user, not just

171
00:13:11,804 --> 00:13:17,924
static demographic attributes like
a region how the user behavior is.

172
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:21,344
It's not like static behavior.

173
00:13:21,374 --> 00:13:28,354
It's dynamically based on the how user is
behaving it and personalized experience.

174
00:13:28,854 --> 00:13:31,074
This is like Tyler interfaces.

175
00:13:31,614 --> 00:13:33,294
Content recommendations.

176
00:13:33,924 --> 00:13:38,814
AI can identify what is good
recommendation based on the user

177
00:13:38,814 --> 00:13:41,334
behavior and feature highlights.

178
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:46,305
This is the key in the framework
and engagement measurement.

179
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:50,465
So we generally take the metrics,
comprehensive metrics, capturing

180
00:13:50,465 --> 00:13:52,295
depth and quality of interaction.

181
00:13:52,795 --> 00:13:56,874
How suppose they can, how long the video
is and how much time they watch it.

182
00:13:57,714 --> 00:14:00,655
This's the easy example
of engagement measurement.

183
00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:06,344
These systems maintain engagement
even during incident recovery periods

184
00:14:06,844 --> 00:14:11,164
by routing users to unaffected
features and contents, minimizing

185
00:14:11,164 --> 00:14:14,995
the would impact on their experience.

186
00:14:15,495 --> 00:14:23,465
So during instant recovery, even the EA
enabled system will track and provide the

187
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:29,335
unaffected features and content companies
implementing advanced personalization,

188
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:36,254
C 22 to 28, higher customer lifetime
value, and significantly improved

189
00:14:36,254 --> 00:14:38,264
resilience to service receptions.

190
00:14:38,764 --> 00:14:43,264
So the companies who are implementing
this model Frameworks has better

191
00:14:43,264 --> 00:14:48,034
advanced personalization, C 22, 20
8% higher lifetime customer lifetime.

192
00:14:48,664 --> 00:14:52,385
So those who are taking a one year
subscription, they're continuing

193
00:14:52,385 --> 00:14:56,224
to one year subscription, not
terminating at eight months.

194
00:14:56,704 --> 00:15:01,944
This frameworks help to retain
their customer lifetime and

195
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:06,414
significantly improved their service
during, even during descriptions.

196
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:08,774
And dynamic pricing.

197
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:14,494
All dams help in improving the
revenue model during the incident.

198
00:15:14,994 --> 00:15:18,655
So this is mainly focusing on
balancing value and revenue.

199
00:15:19,155 --> 00:15:23,925
So the pricing system say, help
in subscription business, maximize

200
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:25,800
both acquisitions and retention.

201
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:32,690
So it considers key parts,
value-based pricing that aligns

202
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,810
cost with customer benefit.

203
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:41,650
So it is derived by how satisfied
the customer, how the content is

204
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:46,930
useful for them, how value based
pricing, what value the company

205
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,640
is providing that much pricing.

206
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:54,360
And elasticity model that produce
conversion rates at various price points.

207
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:59,050
What is the best conversion
rate that can be available?

208
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:05,770
That can predict the, a model can
predict and complete to positioning that

209
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,050
dynamically adjust to market changes.

210
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,980
The market changes like the
customer behavior is tuning

211
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,499
to different, experience.

212
00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:21,179
So this AI helps metrics, helps these
algorithms, helps in trying to position

213
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:28,609
the company into dynamically adjustable
market changes, risk adjustment

214
00:16:28,609 --> 00:16:33,650
offerings that provides appropriate
discounts to add risk segments.

215
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,960
Some segments are risk, so it'll provide
a better offering and it'll recommend the.

216
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:44,710
Go right, or these algorithms help
in optimization need those risks.

217
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:49,740
These systems automatically adjust
during instant recovery periods.

218
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:57,140
So if an incident happens, so
how we it, the AI will balance

219
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,720
out the value and the revenue.

220
00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:05,240
These four models will help in balancing
out the value and revenue during.

221
00:17:05,645 --> 00:17:09,965
Incident recovery periods,
the downtime, future, and

222
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:13,185
availabilities system failures.

223
00:17:13,635 --> 00:17:19,695
So providing target and incentives to
users who experience service disruption.

224
00:17:20,535 --> 00:17:26,915
So it helped to find the right segment of
users and provide the rise in with broadly

225
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:29,015
discounting for unaffected segment.

226
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:33,145
And what is the journey to optimize this?

227
00:17:33,775 --> 00:17:38,815
How, what is aware user
journey optimization?

228
00:17:39,265 --> 00:17:43,165
What is the user journey during
this incident management process?

229
00:17:43,165 --> 00:17:45,310
So say the before the incident.

230
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:50,710
Pre-incident standard personalized
journeys based on engagement patterns.

231
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:53,365
And conversion optimization.

232
00:17:54,265 --> 00:17:56,575
This is before an incident happened.

233
00:17:57,385 --> 00:18:02,165
We have these engagement patterns,
how the customers are engaged with the

234
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:09,294
features or patterns we have, and active
incident dynamically during rerouting

235
00:18:09,294 --> 00:18:15,685
to functional features, transparent
communication and expectation management.

236
00:18:16,185 --> 00:18:22,004
So during an incident, this AI model
will help rerouting to functional

237
00:18:22,004 --> 00:18:29,284
features, how which feature is more
feasible and how we can transparently

238
00:18:29,284 --> 00:18:35,074
communicate those features to the
users and meet the user expectations.

239
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:36,475
Initial recovery.

240
00:18:36,975 --> 00:18:40,534
It's like enabling of features
with prioritized access

241
00:18:40,534 --> 00:18:42,064
for high value customers.

242
00:18:42,784 --> 00:18:48,814
So when you recover it, who is the
right set of users has to access that?

243
00:18:49,314 --> 00:18:55,465
Then we can reprioritize to a
low level of low level, low value

244
00:18:55,465 --> 00:18:58,274
customers and stabilization.

245
00:18:59,144 --> 00:19:03,404
Targeted re-engagement campaigns
and satisfaction monitoring

246
00:19:03,404 --> 00:19:05,834
with compensatory offerings.

247
00:19:06,334 --> 00:19:11,974
So to stabilize this to understand the
user behavior, understand the engagement,

248
00:19:12,274 --> 00:19:17,494
how user is engaging with, and by
monitoring with compensatory offerings,

249
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:22,564
it'll offer to provide a new offers, new
feature, new free features like that.

250
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,684
And post recovery growth.

251
00:19:25,184 --> 00:19:31,134
Post recovery growth how the growth of
the company or growth of the product.

252
00:19:32,124 --> 00:19:37,725
During our, after this is mainly focusing
on after incident accelerated feature

253
00:19:37,725 --> 00:19:43,304
adoption and expansion opportunities
with renewable trust emphasis.

254
00:19:44,145 --> 00:19:48,495
Try to build the trust, try to
provide the right service, try

255
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:49,949
to improve the good offerings.

256
00:19:50,449 --> 00:19:55,549
This AI leading subscription
business don't just manage incidents.

257
00:19:55,639 --> 00:20:00,279
They transform the entire user
experience around service descriptions

258
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:04,529
to maintain engagement and
protect customer lifetime value.

259
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:05,299
Yeah.

260
00:20:05,749 --> 00:20:12,109
And to implement this, what
roadmap we have in place psych

261
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:14,009
the main four categories we have.

262
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:16,469
Foundational data collection.

263
00:20:16,969 --> 00:20:22,339
It'll focus on comprehensive
telemetry across all the system

264
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:27,529
components with unified logging
and standardized event formats.

265
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:31,709
The timeline it takes around
one to two months, and the

266
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:32,954
next one is baseline modeling.

267
00:20:33,454 --> 00:20:39,154
So this in during this time, it'll
establish normal operation patterns and

268
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:44,964
identify key performance indicators,
what indicators are required for

269
00:20:44,964 --> 00:20:49,094
specific business and correlate
with user satisfaction to understand

270
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:52,569
the user behavior, which patterns,
which indicators are required.

271
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:55,719
It'll model during that baseline modeling.

272
00:20:56,679 --> 00:20:58,179
This will take around.

273
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,439
Two to three months.

274
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:00,489
Yeah.

275
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:06,699
And initial detection models,
so this is like a deploy first

276
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:10,929
degeneration, anomaly detection
with human verification feedbacks.

277
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:19,619
And this loops to minimize false post two
is AI system, which will be trained with

278
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:22,609
the feedbacks that's coming from human.

279
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:23,779
Verification.

280
00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:29,879
So initially it starts with the
AA first generation system and

281
00:21:29,879 --> 00:21:34,619
later on getting trained with human
verification feedbacks and it getting,

282
00:21:35,189 --> 00:21:39,909
trying and better for future model.

283
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:46,239
It takes around three to four months
and response automation gradually

284
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:49,269
implement automated responses.

285
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:55,294
For well understood incident patterns
with clear remediation parts.

286
00:21:56,014 --> 00:22:00,454
So after the initial detection models,
we'll go to response automation.

287
00:22:01,114 --> 00:22:05,914
It was system is fully trained
and it was gradually implemented

288
00:22:06,004 --> 00:22:10,374
the automated responses as we
captured the human responses in

289
00:22:10,374 --> 00:22:13,064
the third in the previous months.

290
00:22:13,484 --> 00:22:15,944
And now we are going
to automated responses.

291
00:22:16,444 --> 00:22:21,574
The incident patterns with clear
remediation parts will analyze it

292
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:26,214
and continuing the advanced
capabilities with implementation

293
00:22:26,214 --> 00:22:31,874
roadmap, there are two, which takes
one with the six to 12 months.

294
00:22:32,624 --> 00:22:35,594
This mainly focus on
user impact correlation.

295
00:22:36,094 --> 00:22:40,744
Connect systems metrics directly
to user experience indicators.

296
00:22:41,244 --> 00:22:47,994
So we have, it'll follow some of the
indicators, metrics, it'll co correlate

297
00:22:47,994 --> 00:22:54,624
with the user experience and predictive
modeling or predicting shift from reactive

298
00:22:54,654 --> 00:22:58,424
to anticipatory incident management.

299
00:22:58,924 --> 00:23:04,144
So this is a great, with predictor
modeling, it'll shift how the incident

300
00:23:04,144 --> 00:23:09,834
management system will re from
reactor to predictor and retention

301
00:23:09,894 --> 00:23:14,694
integration, link incident data
with customer engagement systems.

302
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:19,124
This will help in
retention of the customers.

303
00:23:19,624 --> 00:23:22,624
And the second model we
have here to and beyond.

304
00:23:23,124 --> 00:23:28,194
So in this phase it takes
autonomous recovery, self-healing

305
00:23:28,194 --> 00:23:33,324
systems with minimal human
interventions, autonomous recovery.

306
00:23:33,824 --> 00:23:38,744
It'll gain the knowledge by itself,
which is called self-healing

307
00:23:38,744 --> 00:23:44,144
systems, and trained by themselves
without human intervention.

308
00:23:44,644 --> 00:23:50,364
And the next topic it is cross
platform intelligence, which is shared

309
00:23:50,364 --> 00:23:52,704
learning across multiple product lines.

310
00:23:53,204 --> 00:23:57,704
So multiple A models or multiple
systems has common data.

311
00:23:58,214 --> 00:24:03,334
It'll share the data to get and
trying the A model, continuous

312
00:24:03,334 --> 00:24:08,554
architecture revolution system that
adopt based on incident patterns.

313
00:24:09,054 --> 00:24:14,394
This architecture will continuously
improve and improve adaptability

314
00:24:14,894 --> 00:24:16,754
based on incident patterns.

315
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:20,704
So incident patterns the first
quarter, what type of incidents

316
00:24:20,704 --> 00:24:23,869
and what geography or from which
discovery, which product line.

317
00:24:23,969 --> 00:24:26,229
So it's not like incident patterns.

318
00:24:26,944 --> 00:24:30,934
This is continuously evolve and find
the new patterns and continuously

319
00:24:30,934 --> 00:24:32,014
architecture will evolve.

320
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:32,804
Yeah.

321
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:34,419
Is the roadmap.

322
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:35,159
Yeah.

323
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:38,459
And the guidelines for
resource investment.

324
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:46,779
So the, we classify as team structure,
which is hybrid squared, combining SRE

325
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:49,929
data scientists and product engineers.

326
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:54,394
The ranges, it range from the project
size to five to seven members.

327
00:24:55,129 --> 00:24:57,260
And executed with execute sponsorship.

328
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:04,120
And when it comes to technology stack,
the real time data processing framework is

329
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:09,640
uses machine learning, operations platform
and automated orchestration tools.

330
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:15,130
It is visualization capabilities, so
we need a visualization to see the

331
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:19,639
performance, the matrix, the output,
along with the machine learning

332
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:21,534
frameworks and real time data crossing.

333
00:25:22,034 --> 00:25:27,774
With mathematical models which we covers
under technology stack and investment

334
00:25:28,014 --> 00:25:31,254
returns, we can take it around.

335
00:25:31,254 --> 00:25:36,445
On enterprise implementations, show
around three to five times the return

336
00:25:36,655 --> 00:25:42,284
on investments within 18 months
through reduce downtime and improve

337
00:25:42,284 --> 00:25:45,344
retention and decrease recovery costs.

338
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:51,345
Sees the what this AI driven system
is capable of giving three to five

339
00:25:51,345 --> 00:25:58,924
x or y. The KEYT chem is with this
model it a driven, it transforms

340
00:25:58,984 --> 00:26:02,614
AI transforms incident management
from reactive to predictive.

341
00:26:03,114 --> 00:26:06,204
So the A model is staying
from reactor to predictor.

342
00:26:06,504 --> 00:26:11,234
We are expecting the same early
detection and automated response

343
00:26:11,294 --> 00:26:13,604
dramatically reduced customer impact.

344
00:26:14,174 --> 00:26:18,254
We are predicting and detecting
early and providing automated

345
00:26:18,254 --> 00:26:24,334
response, which reduce customer
impact and architectural resilience

346
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:26,074
in your revenue production strategy.

347
00:26:26,574 --> 00:26:31,824
So how the architecture helps the
intelligent systems maintain functionality

348
00:26:32,604 --> 00:26:36,414
because the intelligent system know
which functionality is more critical,

349
00:26:36,914 --> 00:26:41,474
even during partial failure, it's keep
on running with critical functionality

350
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:47,624
and the user behavior preference drive
the, which functionality is critical.

351
00:26:48,124 --> 00:26:52,574
And user experience continuity
require cross-functional integration.

352
00:26:53,074 --> 00:26:56,044
This is like connecting
technical monitoring with

353
00:26:56,104 --> 00:26:57,964
customer engagement systems.

354
00:26:58,714 --> 00:27:01,404
And so it's cross-functional integration.

355
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:06,434
The technical monitoring with
the customer engagement systems.

356
00:27:06,974 --> 00:27:12,704
Hey, customer can do some part of
our operations by themselves and

357
00:27:12,704 --> 00:27:14,264
they can monitor by themselves.

358
00:27:14,764 --> 00:27:18,754
These features in the cross-functional
integration by cross-functionally

359
00:27:18,754 --> 00:27:22,444
integrate the technical monitoring
with the customer engagement systems

360
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:25,804
like CRM and back office systems.

361
00:27:26,304 --> 00:27:30,674
The user experience APRO
and implementation follows

362
00:27:30,674 --> 00:27:32,384
a clear maturity model.

363
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:36,934
So start with foundations and
progress build advanced capabilities.

364
00:27:37,434 --> 00:27:43,844
Like auto response start with initial
detection model and then growing up to

365
00:27:43,844 --> 00:27:46,424
advanced capabilities of auto response.

366
00:27:47,234 --> 00:27:53,454
These helps in implementing
with more clear maturity model.

367
00:27:53,954 --> 00:27:57,194
Thank you for joining this conference.
