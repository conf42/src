Performance and quality
benchmarks before release.

27
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,930
Despite advancements in automation,
traditional methods of generating

28
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,000
and validating test cases still face
significant challenges, including

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,290
prolonged timelines, human error,
incomplete test coverage, and

30
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,090
high cost of manual intervention.

31
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,009
These limitations often lead
to delayed product launches and

32
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,500
unidentified defects that compromise.

33
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:16,484

00:02:30,344 --> 00:02:33,855
traditional testing methods based
on static scripts and predefined

38
00:02:33,855 --> 00:02:35,774
scenarios struggle to maintain.

39
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:38,505
The second key challenge
is maintenance burden.

40
00:02:38,895 --> 00:02:43,605
Test maintenance accounts for
approximately 30% of total testing

41
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:48,825
effort, creating a significant drag on
testing efficiency as systems evolve.

42
00:02:49,275 --> 00:02:52,995
And the third challenge is limited
coverage, where traditional

43
00:02:53,055 --> 00:02:57,285
approaches typically achieve
only 40 to 60% test coverage.

44
00:02:57,555 --> 00:03:02,865
Missing critical integration scenarios
as interactions between systems create

45
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:05,355
exponentially more test scenarios.

46
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,130
In this slide, we can notice how
organizations are rapidly moving

47
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,170
from usage of traditional testing
methods to a power testing solutions.

More edge cases compared to manual test
design, significantly improving overall

78
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,045
test coverage and risk detection.

79
00:05:27,465 --> 00:05:32,145
And the third key aspect is usage
of natural language processing.

80
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:37,545
NLP based approaches transform how
test cases are created from business

81
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:42,315
requirements, enabling non-technical
stakeholders to contribute more

82
00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:45,465
effectively through the I interfaces.

83
00:05:47,385 --> 00:05:52,755
The next, a power testing solution is
usage of self-healing testing frameworks.

84
00:05:53,115 --> 00:05:56,715
A self-healing test framework is a
type of test automation framework

85
00:05:56,925 --> 00:06:01,575
that can automatically identify and
fix issues that arise during test

86
00:06:01,575 --> 00:06:06,015
execution due to changes in the
applications, UI or underlying code.

87
00:06:06,735 --> 00:06:10,485
This is achieved by using
a driven algorithms to

88
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:12,375
dynamically update test scripts.

89
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:17,820

structures, and business logics.

93
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,270
Another self-healing test framework is
to analyze the impact, which determines

94
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,700
how change affect existing test scripts.

95
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,080
And execution path.

96
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,120
And the third capability is adaptive
tests, which automatically update

97
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,719
test scripts to accommodate changes
without manual intervention.

98
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,969
Self-healing frameworks dramatically
reduce maintenance requirements,

99
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,770
which typically account for 70% of
the total cost of test automation

100
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,180
in traditional environments.

101
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,140
Research shows that these
frameworks can reduce maintenance

102
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,539
requirements by up to 60%.

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,550
With visual, A technologies
particularly effective for maintaining

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,550
UI tests across changing interfaces.

105
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:22,050
The next a power testing solution is usage
of autonomous execution and monitoring

106
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,969
techniques, which refers to systems
that can operate and manage themselves,

107
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:32,040
performing tasks and responding to issues
without constant human intervention.

108
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,550
This includes self-diagnosis, remediation.

109
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,650
And even re-planning based on a
real-time data and predefined rules.

110
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:46,890
Essentially, it's the ability of a system
to autonomously manage its own operations

111
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,770
and ensure its continued performance.

112

00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:36,375
Machine learning algorithms can identify
subtile patterns in system behavior that

122
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:41,685
might indicate potential issues before
they manifest as failures, reducing

123
00:08:41,685 --> 00:08:44,415
production incidents by up to 45%.

124
00:08:45,795 --> 00:08:51,380
Next, a power testing solution is usage
of advanced AI powered anomaly detection

125
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,515
