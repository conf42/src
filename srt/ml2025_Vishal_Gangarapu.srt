00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,860
Hi, I'm and welcome to my talk
on machine learning management.

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,970
I have over 13 years of experience in
finance, digital transformation, focused

3
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,840
on enterprise performance management
tools and expense optimization.

4
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,650
And today I want share some lessons
I've learned the way in my career

5
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,280
journey, and I hope this will be
useful for most of your listening.

6
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,580
In today's Asian world, we see many
organizations focused on optimizing

7
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,960
and reducing expense base as a way to
improve their profit margins and give

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,730
a better return to their shareholders.

9
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,860
However, we see many financial teams such
as F teams struggling with inaccurate and

10
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,390
inefficient processing of expense data.

11
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,305
They spend excessive time
with reconciliations.

12
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:57,225
While strategic decisions are
hindered by incomplete and

13
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:58,845
inaccurate expense forecasting,

14
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:03,795
some of these challenges can be addressed
by utilizing machine learning models

15
00:01:03,945 --> 00:01:07,395
to transform how businesses manage,
analyze, and optimize their expenses.

16
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:12,825
I've used financial services as
a reference for many of my slides

17
00:01:12,825 --> 00:01:15,855
here, but these concepts apply to
pretty much every industry out there.

18
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:18,860
So without further ado, let's just.

19
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,840
So to set a baseline, let's talk about
some problems with the traditional expense

20
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,380
forecasting methods where there is no
utilization of historical data trends and

21
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,470
patterns to refine your expense forecast.

22
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,900
So with those traditional methods, we
see about 27% of forecasting accuracy,

23
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,770
which means your expense forecast
deviate that much from your actions,

24
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,600
undermining your budget process.

25
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:45,554
We see about 42% classification.

26
00:01:45,945 --> 00:01:49,455
So these are pure expense categories,
categorization, classification,

27
00:01:50,115 --> 00:01:53,895
and it could lead to significant
misallocations of expenses across

28
00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:55,755
departments and their performance.

29
00:01:56,744 --> 00:02:02,115
And overall, this leads to high budget
volatility, meaning the way when you

30
00:02:02,115 --> 00:02:04,005
start off your budget exercise and

31
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:05,514
variation in.

32
00:02:06,514 --> 00:02:08,404
The budget exercise.

33
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,044
So as you can see, traditional
methods fall of expectations,

34
00:02:14,044 --> 00:02:15,305
and we need a smarter approach.

35
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:17,714
So what is that smart approach?

36
00:02:18,134 --> 00:02:19,004
Let's just get there.

37
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:20,154
Now.

38
00:02:20,154 --> 00:02:24,264
This approach is basically categorized
into four different steps, and

39
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:27,619
it's a sequential process here.

40
00:02:28,144 --> 00:02:31,804
Starting with organizing your raw
financial data, which includes your

41
00:02:31,804 --> 00:02:37,534
expense data into structured taxonomies
and hierarchies, which make it an optimal

42
00:02:37,534 --> 00:02:39,094
setup for machine learning analysis.

43
00:02:40,324 --> 00:02:45,334
And once you have your data ready to
go, you can deploy any basic outta

44
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:48,419
the box machine learning model, or you
can build your own custom models to

45
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:54,149
analyze that data and identify some
hidden patterns, correlations, and an

46
00:02:54,149 --> 00:02:56,789
anomalies with any complex expense.

47
00:02:57,789 --> 00:03:01,564
And after your initial analysis,
you can generate some insights and

48
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:06,454
discoveries using some strategic business
intelligence tools like dashboards or

49
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:10,714
even simple analysis tools like Excel
to give you some insights that help

50
00:03:10,714 --> 00:03:17,349
you make some strategic decisions which
drive measurable cost optimization

51
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:19,749
decision.

52
00:03:20,749 --> 00:03:22,849
Input make it.

53
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:25,289
So let's just go deeper here.

54
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:33,299
And before we go into side of things,
I wanna upon a few definitions and

55
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:38,549
way we define expense and department
hierarchies in organization.

56
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:43,319
Forecasting with machine
learning works the best.

57
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:48,389
So my first slide here is
about cost and profit centers.

58
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,789
And this concept I know is not very new.

59
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:54,654
Every organization, every company
out there has a concept of cost

60
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:58,574
and profit centers, but I've seen a
simple missing in many organizations,

61
00:03:58,574 --> 00:03:59,429
which I wanna highlight here.

62
00:04:00,464 --> 00:04:02,349
So I'll start off with the basic
definition of cost centers.

63
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:08,494
As you think of these are the departments
or in terms of data, the fields where

64
00:04:09,304 --> 00:04:15,274
you book your expenses, and these are
expenses that could be generated while

65
00:04:15,274 --> 00:04:18,844
you produce your revenue, or it could
be overhead costs necessary for running

66
00:04:18,844 --> 00:04:23,674
a business, which includes the pure
cost centers such as hr, IT facilities.

67
00:04:24,674 --> 00:04:30,684
And any nonpersonal expenses such as
data fees or sub subscription fees.

68
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:35,294
So in short, cost centers are
where you book your expenses.

69
00:04:37,154 --> 00:04:40,094
And moving on to the next definition
here, which is profit centers.

70
00:04:41,024 --> 00:04:44,654
These as a name suggest strategic
business units where you.

71
00:04:45,654 --> 00:04:50,514
Front trading or sales divisions or
product line divisions where you produce

72
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:53,074
or make a sale and generate revenue.

73
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,984
And that revenue is against
these profit center quote.

74
00:04:58,624 --> 00:05:02,794
Now, the nuance I wanna highlight
is every profit center should and

75
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:06,909
must have a equivalent cost center
where you book your expenses against.

76
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:13,429
So that means every profit center
has a cost center, but then not every

77
00:05:13,429 --> 00:05:16,249
cost center has a profit center.

78
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:18,589
So those pure cost like it,

79
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:24,214
they revenue need code for

80
00:05:25,214 --> 00:05:29,489
assuming that is clear, let's get to
the next set of business definitions.

81
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,659
Business definitions.

82
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:36,049
So I wanna talk about the expense
hierarchal framework here, which divides

83
00:05:36,049 --> 00:05:40,729
expenses into three different categories,
starting with direct expenses, which make

84
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:43,459
about 38% of any organization expenses.

85
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:50,644
These are costs that tied specific
to revenue activities with the,

86
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:53,609
with clear ownership of where
the revenues are coming from.

87
00:05:54,239 --> 00:06:00,929
So these could be personal compensation
and benefit expenses related to

88
00:06:00,929 --> 00:06:03,119
people and teams in profit centers.

89
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:10,079
Or it could be direct revenues
produced in revenue units such as

90
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:13,529
license costs or data, subscription
fees and things like that.

91
00:06:14,429 --> 00:06:17,834
So in short, direct
expenses are booked to.

92
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:19,464
Gets allocated to

93
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:20,644
now.

94
00:06:20,644 --> 00:06:22,354
The next bucket is allocated expenses.

95
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,504
This sounds a little bit like debt
expenses, but here I'm more focused

96
00:06:26,504 --> 00:06:32,014
on the organization overhead costs,
which you can think of the technology

97
00:06:32,014 --> 00:06:36,634
costs, the it costs the compliance,
legal risk teams cost, where these

98
00:06:36,634 --> 00:06:38,044
are all essential for a success.

99
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:41,804
And these are peer cost centers like
we spoke about in the earlier slide.

100
00:06:42,704 --> 00:06:47,624
And these could have some expenses,
which could be confused as

101
00:06:47,624 --> 00:06:51,584
direct expenses because all these
functions have dedicated personal.

102
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:55,304
So all those expenses are direct
expenses in those cost centers.

103
00:06:55,904 --> 00:07:00,554
But then at the end, all these expenses
get allocated to frontend profit

104
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:03,524
centers, which would then help you.

105
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:05,184
Expenses are

106
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:10,524
then waterfall method

107
00:07:12,714 --> 00:07:19,049
flow expenses, where when department
allocate to another department,

108
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:20,904
it only works one way and.

109
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:25,744
So these overall expenses make
about 45% of any organization's

110
00:07:25,744 --> 00:07:27,514
expenses, so roughly half.

111
00:07:27,784 --> 00:07:28,714
And that's very standard.

112
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:33,064
And then the third bucket
here is the variable expenses.

113
00:07:33,514 --> 00:07:37,204
So these, as the name suggest,
are variable and they scale up as

114
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:41,329
your organization or your company
scales up and these are produced as

115
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:42,499
and when you're producing revenue.

116
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:47,609
It could be any non overhead costs that
are directly a function of your revenues.

117
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:52,169
So these exceptions are a, these
expenses are a bit of an exception

118
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:56,849
because these are produced during
revenue generation process.

119
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:59,759
So these get booked
directly to profit centers.

120
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:03,734
So this is a slide deviation
from what we discussed earlier.

121
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:04,974
I would.

122
00:08:05,974 --> 00:08:07,234
So now this is established.

123
00:08:07,414 --> 00:08:12,154
Let's move on to the more technical
aspects of using machine learning models.

124
00:08:13,154 --> 00:08:16,094
So the first step for building
any technological solution to,

125
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:19,574
to make your business better is
to have a strong data foundation.

126
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,629
Is to identify your required types.

127
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,639
So in this case, we're
talking about forecasting.

128
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,889
So we need have clearly defined
transaction metta we need

129
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:37,304
historical categorization
between, it real estate and so on.

130
00:08:37,304 --> 00:08:38,979
Categor expenses have to.

131
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,719
We also need vendor information.

132
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:45,824
So these are third party vendors and
companies that we make payments to.

133
00:08:47,354 --> 00:08:50,744
And once you identify those data
types, you need to prepare your

134
00:08:50,744 --> 00:08:54,674
data to be able to be effectively
used in a machine learning model.

135
00:08:55,304 --> 00:08:59,184
So that means you need to standardize
your transaction formats handle

136
00:08:59,544 --> 00:09:00,569
missing values in your data.

137
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:05,229
This is, in other words, mastering
your categorization data.

138
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:08,859
And we also need to normalize your vendor
information in terms of formatting and

139
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,289
so that the machine can recognize it.

140
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:12,999
It's a vendor information
every time you input it.

141
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:17,769
And then once you have these steps
done, you need to build your data

142
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:21,129
structures around your transaction
records, which unique such as

143
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:22,659
primary keys and foreign keys.

144
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:23,349
And you.

145
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:25,339
Required for your organization.

146
00:09:25,489 --> 00:09:28,099
So if it's a financial services
firm, you might need some

147
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:30,469
external data as reference data.

148
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:31,819
So that's an example there.

149
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:36,699
So any robust machine learning
implementation requires comprehensive

150
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:39,939
data span at least 12 to 18 months
before you can utilize that to do

151
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:42,369
your budget reporting forecast.

152
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,039
And as they all say.

153
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:50,329
How properly your data is structured
and how it, how your math data

154
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:53,724
is defined, and how your data is
clean and all, all well defined.

155
00:09:54,724 --> 00:09:58,948
So with that, once we set up your
initial, your groundwork to set

156
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:00,193
up your initial data structures.

157
00:10:01,193 --> 00:10:04,973
I wanna talk about a simple low
hanging fruit use case of utilizing

158
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:07,853
a quick machine learning model
to make your job better as a

159
00:10:07,853 --> 00:10:09,653
financial analyst or an team member.

160
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:14,333
So one such use case is your, is
an automated class classification

161
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,383
using a machine learning model.

162
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:21,893
So this is simply helping you
automate the way you categor expenses.

163
00:10:22,893 --> 00:10:27,073
And with those transactions, you clearly
define your categories of expenses, spoke

164
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:31,973
before between it, hr, your reimbursement,
your travel costs, and so on.

165
00:10:33,713 --> 00:10:38,183
And then you engineer your
features around those expenses.

166
00:10:38,243 --> 00:10:43,433
So this could be your transaction
amounts, your vendor timing patterns,

167
00:10:43,553 --> 00:10:45,028
your payment methods, and also.

168
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:48,158
And using

169
00:10:49,158 --> 00:10:50,303
another use case for.

170
00:10:51,303 --> 00:10:53,253
So this anomaly detection here.

171
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:59,003
So these are simply identifying any
outliers or anomalies in your expenses.

172
00:10:59,543 --> 00:11:04,403
So an example would be a spike
in it to a product line unit.

173
00:11:05,783 --> 00:11:10,313
And this could be a allocation
or could be a misallocation.

174
00:11:10,313 --> 00:11:15,213
So this model identifies that,
and for that work you, you need

175
00:11:15,213 --> 00:11:16,308
to clearly define your features.

176
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:27,138
So that would include involve transforming
all your raw transac data into categories,

177
00:11:27,798 --> 00:11:34,458
your master metadata defined, and then
for your model itself around how much your

178
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,378
expenses are deviating from expectations.

179
00:11:37,158 --> 00:11:37,968
And you can also set up.

180
00:11:38,968 --> 00:11:44,698
Routing with expenses and
have them reviewed by,

181
00:11:45,698 --> 00:11:45,938
and

182
00:11:48,338 --> 00:11:55,113
you could also give feedback
them or help them better

183
00:11:55,113 --> 00:11:57,003
identify anomalies in the future.

184
00:11:57,003 --> 00:12:00,153
So that means reducing your false
positives and making your machine work.

185
00:12:00,973 --> 00:12:03,708
Machine learning model work better
with each cycle going forward.

186
00:12:05,388 --> 00:12:10,128
So typically, anomaly detection system
employs multiple sophisticated approaches.

187
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:13,338
They could be as simple as any
unsupervised learning algorithms,

188
00:12:13,908 --> 00:12:19,758
or you could also use statistical
techniques like which are applicable

189
00:12:20,058 --> 00:12:21,138
for any distribution functions.

190
00:12:23,613 --> 00:12:27,423
Further and deploy advanced
machine learning or deep learning

191
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:32,523
auto really complex patterns
with extensive financial data.

192
00:12:33,523 --> 00:12:37,663
And as you could, as you can imagine,
each model should be customed your

193
00:12:37,663 --> 00:12:40,123
organization size, complexity.

194
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:44,143
Model doesn't fit for
everybody is what the point is.

195
00:12:45,163 --> 00:12:48,733
And with those models you could
also define dynamic threshold.

196
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:54,083
So the model incorporates any
seasonal patterns on both while

197
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:57,883
customizing sensitivity controls
to allow precise tuning by expense

198
00:12:58,163 --> 00:12:59,643
category to minimize false positives.

199
00:13:00,643 --> 00:13:03,943
So these are some really like high
level use cases, which could be

200
00:13:04,093 --> 00:13:08,493
quickly achieved and established and
make a big difference to your day

201
00:13:08,493 --> 00:13:10,773
to day expense management processes.

202
00:13:13,173 --> 00:13:15,333
Now let's talk about a
bit more complex use case.

203
00:13:15,603 --> 00:13:18,483
So this is the time series
forecasting up expenses, so where

204
00:13:18,483 --> 00:13:19,833
you would forecast your expenses.

205
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:24,258
Where budgeting and forecasting into play.

206
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:33,243
So as mentioned, this complex
selection on timeframe,

207
00:13:34,243 --> 00:13:38,408
so starting with the smaller
timeframes for about one to

208
00:13:38,408 --> 00:13:39,703
three months, which is a quarter.

209
00:13:42,668 --> 00:13:48,033
You could use models such as the Arima
model, which is the integrated moving

210
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:54,243
average model, which is more suitable
for stable expenses such as it costs,

211
00:13:54,273 --> 00:13:58,293
which are more or less predictable
and for the not so stable expenses

212
00:13:58,293 --> 00:14:02,228
that compliance costs, which are more
variable depending on the business.

213
00:14:03,228 --> 00:14:03,978
Forecasting,

214
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:07,788
which again, would take into account

215
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:12,568
and those longer term, anything
over one year or longer, you

216
00:14:12,568 --> 00:14:13,618
might have to use an ensemble of.

217
00:14:14,618 --> 00:14:18,578
For each of these models focused
on individual timeframes, you

218
00:14:18,578 --> 00:14:21,098
could use metrics such as the MAPP

219
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:24,838
for any accuracy measurement.

220
00:14:25,978 --> 00:14:30,418
And these are powerful metrics to help you
identify if your model is working well.

221
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:32,918
And also to give it the right feedback to.

222
00:14:33,918 --> 00:14:39,348
Defining it further as you go into your
process and use them for dayday use cases.

223
00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:43,628
So again, I wanna highlight that for
all these work you need to have your

224
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:47,438
data those, you need to have your data

225
00:14:50,258 --> 00:14:51,073
recognized and.

226
00:14:52,073 --> 00:14:56,453
So with that I wanna also like
recap on the implementation roadmap.

227
00:14:57,823 --> 00:14:59,263
So starting with the data assessment.

228
00:14:59,663 --> 00:15:03,263
So this goes this back to
the step of organizing and

229
00:15:03,363 --> 00:15:04,713
figuring out your data sources.

230
00:15:05,703 --> 00:15:09,033
So your first step would
be to assessment to.

231
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:11,593
Think about buying a
machine learning model.

232
00:15:14,353 --> 00:15:18,013
And once, once you have the step
next, the next step would be to

233
00:15:18,013 --> 00:15:22,093
assemble and create a of engineers and
specialists and financial analysts.

234
00:15:22,513 --> 00:15:27,023
And this step is really the most
important step, and that's where

235
00:15:28,073 --> 00:15:34,028
many organizations fumble because
it's very quick and easy to.

236
00:15:35,028 --> 00:15:41,718
But then having that team that uses that
to its fullest extent and generates value

237
00:15:42,718 --> 00:15:43,558
the model,

238
00:15:44,558 --> 00:15:47,828
and assuming you have your team set
up then the next step would be to.

239
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:51,673
Deploy, deployment needs to be approach.

240
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:56,793
Don't wanna build a complex machine, wanna

241
00:15:57,793 --> 00:15:59,383
gains and some champions across.

242
00:16:01,153 --> 00:16:02,173
So let's consider.

243
00:16:03,173 --> 00:16:08,933
Of the simple models with automated
expense, categorization and detection,

244
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:13,553
and for those full time series
expense forecasting like we discuss

245
00:16:13,553 --> 00:16:17,093
in the previous slide, I would
give it on two to three months,

246
00:16:17,213 --> 00:16:21,653
assuming that models work well and.

247
00:16:24,503 --> 00:16:30,023
Keep in mind is to have a team, a
process for continuous monitoring

248
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,433
and improvement of the models.

249
00:16:31,563 --> 00:16:34,864
Because even if your models are
working very well, there's a need

250
00:16:34,864 --> 00:16:40,593
to refine, recalibrate, customize
as your organization changes or

251
00:16:41,343 --> 00:16:43,648
especially if it susceptible to any

252
00:16:46,028 --> 00:16:46,248
as.

253
00:16:47,248 --> 00:16:50,657
I wanna quickly touch upon the
technology stack options available

254
00:16:50,657 --> 00:16:54,407
for implementing these machine
learning models in your organization.

255
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:59,292
So if you're a small to medium
size business, there are many

256
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:02,457
open source solutions available
in the market for data processing.

257
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:07,537
Data to visualize it in a way that
makes sense to the business audience.

258
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:09,577
And for deployment.

259
00:17:10,627 --> 00:17:16,387
Like flak, Docker are small to
medium businesses, but if you're a

260
00:17:16,387 --> 00:17:20,457
more bigger business, there are many
other enterprise solutions available.

261
00:17:21,147 --> 00:17:26,637
And nowadays all the p and tools out there
come with inbuilt machine learning modules

262
00:17:26,637 --> 00:17:28,227
that you can quickly deploy and get.

263
00:17:29,227 --> 00:17:34,167
Factor that have to think about those
readily models even those clouds

264
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:35,387
and.

265
00:17:36,387 --> 00:17:39,117
You think about your data
integration architecture.

266
00:17:39,177 --> 00:17:43,677
So you build your data pipelines
for ETL from data sources.

267
00:17:44,127 --> 00:17:50,667
You need to build a feature store
for training your ML model, and then

268
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,107
a model registry for deployment.

269
00:17:52,467 --> 00:17:57,777
And also think about any a layers
that have to build to connect systems,

270
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:04,017
so of finance, build those systems.

271
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:07,977
Manufacturing, build a

272
00:18:10,447 --> 00:18:11,057
keys and

273
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:13,107
your supply chain units

274
00:18:15,847 --> 00:18:16,197
tools.

275
00:18:16,787 --> 00:18:23,927
Make sure effectively, and
again, like I before monitoring.

276
00:18:24,927 --> 00:18:26,787
So with that, I wanna close

277
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:30,048
I some case.

278
00:18:31,613 --> 00:18:33,102
So from finance.

279
00:18:34,102 --> 00:18:36,592
Achieved remarkable
improvements in classification.

280
00:18:37,102 --> 00:18:42,347
So it reduced its class
misclassification rate from 30%, 6%.

281
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:51,257
And in that process, an annual savings
of million, just simply from better cost

282
00:18:51,267 --> 00:18:55,222
visibility and optimization that follows.

283
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:02,617
They were able to achieve 76% reduction
in processing time from just utilizing

284
00:19:03,907 --> 00:19:09,997
a huge manpower for categorizing
and reconciling your expenses.

285
00:19:10,087 --> 00:19:15,412
So the machine model and freeing
up the time for a team to focus on.

286
00:19:16,412 --> 00:19:23,252
This was all achieved within like an 18
month timeframe and three to five, and

287
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:27,092
the initial values, the low three months.

288
00:19:30,062 --> 00:19:34,622
So I hope this inspires you and
this was for you to understand and.
