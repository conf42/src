1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,250
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:02,330
Good morning.

3
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:03,860
I'm Pradeep Kana.

4
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,770
Today we look at how quantum computing
can boost Siemens Teamcenter,

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,230
or any other PLM tool, the PLM
system many of you already use.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,000
So we can choose product options
faster and keep supply chain safer.

7
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:24,680
Think of this as a tool first,
we'll see the business pain.

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,169
Then a quick premium on quantum tech.

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,390
Real world cases, studies risk, and
finally, a step by step roadmap.

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,360
By the end, you should know why,
where, how to start a small but

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,390
meaningful quantum pilot inside PLM.

12
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,310
Let's start with pain
points in dollars and time.

13
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:51,260
A study from interior shows that
every big supply chain hiccups cost a

14
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,110
company about $22 million on average.

15
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:59,060
While the line has come down, we
burned roughly $1.5 million each day.

16
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,540
On top of that product
complexity is exploding.

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,130
The BMW Mini once offered
15 today and valid options.

18
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,720
Combination traditional rule
engines inside PLM, how to check

19
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,750
those options almost one by one.

20
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,430
An impassable task quantum
algorithm can search huge,

21
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,800
spacious infraction of these steps.

22
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,540
So we move from overnight bad
jobs to coffee break answers.

23
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,850
That's previous business case.

24
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,400
Two quick ideas.

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,780
Qubits are tiny elements that can be
one, zero or one at the same time when we

26
00:01:37,785 --> 00:01:40,870
link cobits through entire entanglement.

27
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,170
A singular operation
explores many paths in power.

28
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,820
There are three main
hardwares styles in 2025.

29
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:55,320
Gate model chips like IBM's that run
gentle quantum logic enter layers

30
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:02,490
from D Wave grade for optimization,
neural autumn array like Pascals

31
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,680
that behave like flexible graphs.

32
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,340
Today's machines are still noisy,
so we wrap a small quantum core

33
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,770
with good old classical core.

34
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,190
That hybrid mix already beats.

35
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,860
Classical only solver uncertain
optimization problems.

36
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:28,055
Here is what actually available not
just in labs, but through cloud APIs.

37
00:02:28,555 --> 00:02:31,635
TVA Advantage two 4,400 Kibitz.

38
00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:34,005
Lives since May, 2025.

39
00:02:34,545 --> 00:02:38,955
Pascal a hundred neural
autumn cubits on Google Cloud.

40
00:02:39,455 --> 00:02:46,925
BM Eagle 1 27 cubit gate model
with a 1,386 cubit chip plant.

41
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:53,025
This year, Fugi digital and
linear 8,192 bits already.

42
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:57,135
Plants daily work at
Toyotas tsunami plant.

43
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,445
The good news.

44
00:02:59,015 --> 00:03:01,325
Teamcenter can talk to each of these.

45
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:08,255
Through a simple rest core, the same way,
already sends jobs to an HPC cluster.

46
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:09,175
Nothing.

47
00:03:09,175 --> 00:03:11,425
Here rewrites Teamcenter score.

48
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:17,765
Step one, pull the bill of materials or
supply data through active workspace.

49
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:18,215
Rest.

50
00:03:19,145 --> 00:03:23,615
Step two, convert the data into
maths from the quantum mechanic.

51
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:25,145
Understands.

52
00:03:25,645 --> 00:03:30,550
A QO metrics for optimization or a
probability model for simulations.

53
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,450
And the next step three,
send it to the cloud.

54
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,810
Wait for a few seconds,
get the best answer.

55
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,220
And the last step four, write the new
configuration or risk score back into

56
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,070
Teamcenter so everyone can act on it.

57
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,079
It's a bold on microservice,
not a rip and replace.

58
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:58,219
Remember those 15 trillion mini
options with a quantum handling, we

59
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,490
treat every rule as an energy penalty.

60
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:08,590
The machine naturally slides to a valid
low energy build in milliseconds Toyota.

61
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,480
The idea daily production
sequence runs drop by 90% for

62
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,785
a 10,000 line bombing bomb.

63
00:04:17,285 --> 00:04:22,595
Engineers can now click validate
and see a feasible options list

64
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,965
before their coffee gets cold.

65
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:30,785
Exciting, right when a port
closes, planners run Monte or law

66
00:04:30,785 --> 00:04:33,455
simulation to see projected losses.

67
00:04:33,955 --> 00:04:37,495
Classically, that can mean
1 million scenarios with

68
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:40,075
quantum amplitude estimation.

69
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:49,384
We need only 10,000 to hit the same nce, a
hundred times fewer runs in D wave tests.

70
00:04:49,924 --> 00:04:54,559
Scenario speed jumped from
12 to two 90 per minute.

71
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:59,594
Shrinking is six day
recovery study, 220 hours.

72
00:05:00,094 --> 00:05:04,564
That can be difference between
scrambling and calmly rerouting parts.

73
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:07,494
Quantum is not just for logistics.

74
00:05:07,994 --> 00:05:08,234
Three.

75
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:10,684
Design waves, battery cooling.

76
00:05:10,775 --> 00:05:18,024
CFD covered 92% faster Crash,
FEA run counts fell 68%.

77
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:22,584
Saving 2.1 million per platform.

78
00:05:23,084 --> 00:05:27,019
Polymer chemistry simulations
that used to take three days.

79
00:05:27,584 --> 00:05:29,114
Now finish overnight.

80
00:05:29,614 --> 00:05:34,744
Each result fits back into Teamcenter
Digital Twin, letting designers try

81
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:37,684
more ideas in the same project window.

82
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:39,744
This isn't sign fiction.

83
00:05:40,585 --> 00:05:46,194
Big names are Live Toyota
Digital and Layer sequence.

84
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:48,195
It's line daily.

85
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:51,125
BMW Part plus Pascal.

86
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:59,175
Optimizing metal forming fur, lighter
cars, D-Wave running logistics

87
00:05:59,414 --> 00:06:01,245
pilots for German manufacturers.

88
00:06:01,745 --> 00:06:03,894
Their lessons start small.

89
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,224
Prove value, then scale.

90
00:06:07,724 --> 00:06:10,530
Leadership is on board in January, 2025.

91
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,720
S-A-P-C-U said Quantum
could shrink week long.

92
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,280
MRP runs into one hour.

93
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:21,251
Siemens Digital Industries,
up its quantum r and d budget.

94
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:21,970
In March.

95
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,250
Board level conversations are
sifting from why to when and where.

96
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,840
Quantum computers can also
break today's encryption.

97
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:32,210
So we must protect as we innovate.

98
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:37,270
NIST release the first post
Quantum standards in 2024.

99
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:44,310
Cloud Flare already sees 2% of all web
traffic using P-Q-T-L-S Action item

100
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,305
Audit Team center, supplier portal
for RSA 2048 and plan a cutover.

101
00:06:50,805 --> 00:06:52,740
Every new tech has hurdles.

102
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,900
Right show be decoherence.

103
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,350
We use hybrid error
aware code, vendor lock.

104
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:06,250
Insist on open standards like QIRK gap.

105
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,870
Trend quantum translators
inside the PLM teams.

106
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,720
Hype set phase gated ROI Checkpoints.

107
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,560
So projects live or die on real numbers

108
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,300
here.

109
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,490
A low risk plan, zero to three months.

110
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,025
Pick one high value use case.

111
00:07:26,605 --> 00:07:28,585
Do a cloud proof of concept.

112
00:07:29,085 --> 00:07:32,975
Four to 12 months YM micro
service into production.

113
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:37,211
Benchmark agne CPUs 12 to 24 months.

114
00:07:38,051 --> 00:07:39,281
Roll out to more sites.

115
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:43,446
Swap supplier portal TLS to post quantum.

116
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:47,096
Each gate has clear goals, top metrics.

117
00:07:47,696 --> 00:07:50,546
Keeping spender under control.

118
00:07:51,046 --> 00:07:51,407
Yep.

119
00:07:51,736 --> 00:07:52,787
Tech alone won't win.

120
00:07:53,287 --> 00:07:59,107
We need people who can speak both
PLM and Quantum, create a quantum

121
00:07:59,107 --> 00:08:05,167
translator role run internal hackathons
on real team center data and track

122
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:10,287
progress with new KPIs, like number
of quantum ator bond checks per hour.

123
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:14,837
That builds a culture,
not just a prototype.

124
00:08:15,337 --> 00:08:17,887
To wrap up, hardware is still in.

125
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:22,477
So hybrid approaches and
good data, privacy rules are

126
00:08:22,477 --> 00:08:25,377
vital, but the upside is huge.

127
00:08:26,337 --> 00:08:30,557
Faster designs, safer
supply chains, lower costs.

128
00:08:31,057 --> 00:08:34,087
Quantum PLM is moving from
labs to factory flows.

129
00:08:34,587 --> 00:08:39,207
Teams that explore now will shape
that future instead of chasing it.

130
00:08:39,707 --> 00:08:40,217
Thank you.
