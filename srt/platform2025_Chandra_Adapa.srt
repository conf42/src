1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,110
Hello.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:01,890
Hi everyone.

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,670
Good afternoon.

4
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,970
It's pleasure to be here today.

5
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,380
My session is about very exiting
area, using the blockchain technology

6
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,300
to reinvent master data management.

7
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,800
Where does this matter?

8
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,890
Because master data is like a patient
identities in healthcare or customer, and

9
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,585
the product data in enterprise systems is
a backbone of all the digital operations.

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,759
If this foundation is insecure and
consistent and reliable, everything

11
00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:31,279
build on top of it becomes fragile.

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,370
In my role at LabCorp, I have worked
hands-on with these challenges and I

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,020
will show how we solve them by combining
the blockchain with the enterprise MBM.

14
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,370
By the end, you will see how
the distributed, immutable, and

15
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,000
encrypted platforms can transform
enterprise data management.

16
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,989
What are the traditional MDM chart
data consistency issues with the

17
00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:00,460
traditional MDM and the security
vulnerabilities and performance

18
00:01:00,669 --> 00:01:03,189
bottleneck in compliance complexity.

19
00:01:03,669 --> 00:01:08,620
Traditional MDM started simple,
mostly as a database Consolidation

20
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,090
are data consolidation.

21
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,669
But modern enterprises operates across
multiple geographies and multiple

22
00:01:15,669 --> 00:01:18,250
clouds and dges of the applications.

23
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:24,100
That creates four big pain
points, data consistency.

24
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,750
The if the two systems update, the
customer recorded the same time, you

25
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,150
often get the conflicts are drift.

26
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,400
Second is security.

27
00:01:33,699 --> 00:01:34,600
Centralized.

28
00:01:34,835 --> 00:01:38,110
MDM is a huge target, one breach.

29
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,810
Under the attacker controls
all the master data.

30
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,380
Then the third one is,
which is performance.

31
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,250
As a data grows exponentially,
systems slows down.

32
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,840
And the fourth one, final one
is compliance competencies.

33
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,030
Regulated industries like
healthcare and finance requests,

34
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,000
detailed audit trails and lineage.

35
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,980
Most legacy systems will these
futures on or afterwards.

36
00:02:06,535 --> 00:02:09,025
So she makes them fragile.

37
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:13,615
These challenges show us
why we need new foundation.

38
00:02:13,645 --> 00:02:17,665
Blockchain is for mainly four
categories, immutability and

39
00:02:17,665 --> 00:02:22,735
consensus driven updates, and built in
cryptographic security and transparency.

40
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:26,965
Blockchain directly addresses
these four pain points.

41
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:31,795
First one is immutability
means that once, once data is

42
00:02:31,795 --> 00:02:33,715
started, it can be tampered with.

43
00:02:34,214 --> 00:02:35,384
That is automatic.

44
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:41,474
Second one is consensus means that no
single system decides multiple nodes

45
00:02:41,474 --> 00:02:46,694
must agree before the data changes, which
removes the single points of the failure.

46
00:02:47,054 --> 00:02:51,284
The third one is built in security
through cryptography, ensures

47
00:02:51,554 --> 00:02:54,344
authenticity and confidentiality.

48
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:56,684
And final one is transparency.

49
00:02:57,014 --> 00:03:01,614
Every participant can see and
verify the state of the data.

50
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:08,909
In short, blockchains DNA is natural
fit for the problems of MDM faces today.

51
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:14,339
In traditional systems, this
means keeping the logs and backups

52
00:03:14,339 --> 00:03:16,829
and complex access monitoring.

53
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,200
But in the blockchain,
immutability is built in.

54
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:25,345
Once the transaction is written, it's
mathematically locked into the chain.

55
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:32,365
If anyone tries to change it, the system
will reject it because the cryptographic

56
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:39,025
ash no longer matches these turns audit
trails from the complex manual process

57
00:03:39,025 --> 00:03:45,640
into something automatic under tramp
proof consensus is about the agreement.

58
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,710
In centralized system.

59
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,240
The database administrator or single
system can approve the changes.

60
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,720
That's a convenient but risky act.

61
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,140
With the blockchain, multiple independent
nodes must agree on the change.

62
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:09,030
We use a practical Biogen time
fault tolerance mechanism, which

63
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,450
can tolerate even third, one.

64
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,855
Third of the nodes being
compromised, still remain reliable.

65
00:04:17,395 --> 00:04:19,195
This critical for.

66
00:04:19,695 --> 00:04:20,565
Resilience.

67
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:26,445
It means the platform can withstand
failures and cyber attacks

68
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:29,775
are insider threats and skill.

69
00:04:30,015 --> 00:04:31,455
Deep data, trustworthy.

70
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:37,594
Every transaction is signed with a digital
signature, sadly, who performed it.

71
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:42,385
Data is encrypted both in
the rest and in the transit.

72
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:49,710
So that's much stronger and simple
than managing thousands of individual

73
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:55,499
keys in short securities over
into the fabric of the system.

74
00:04:55,999 --> 00:05:00,679
Transparency is about the trust
in many industries and disputes

75
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,270
arise because each party maintains
their own version of the truth.

76
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:11,119
For example, in supply chains, one
partner might claim and update.

77
00:05:11,554 --> 00:05:15,514
Was made while another
says that it wasn't.

78
00:05:16,114 --> 00:05:22,744
With the blockchain, everyone who has
access to see sees the same verified

79
00:05:22,744 --> 00:05:28,174
ledger that reduces the disputes,
increases the collaboration, and builds

80
00:05:28,174 --> 00:05:31,564
confidence across teams and organizations.

81
00:05:31,804 --> 00:05:35,079
Transparency doesn't mean loss of privacy.

82
00:05:36,005 --> 00:05:40,955
Data is encrypted, but the fact
that the transaction is happened

83
00:05:40,955 --> 00:05:43,405
is visual to authorize parties.

84
00:05:43,905 --> 00:05:47,744
Hyperledger Fabric is the one
of the thing, and attribution

85
00:05:47,744 --> 00:05:49,814
based encryption is another one.

86
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:57,134
IPFS is for large storage, large
data storage, and work to J-W-T-T-L-S

87
00:05:57,134 --> 00:05:59,294
1.3 for the modern security.

88
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:03,424
So we build our MDM platform
only carefully selected.

89
00:06:03,594 --> 00:06:09,129
Stack at the core is a Hyperledger
FA fabric, a permissioned blockchain.

90
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,740
Ideal for enterprise use
for fine-grained access.

91
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:20,130
We use attribute waste encryption, which
enforces the policy, set the data level

92
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:28,289
for storage, large data objects, going
to IPFS and a PPP two P file system.

93
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:33,060
And while the blockchain only keeps
the cryptographic fingerprints.

94
00:06:33,549 --> 00:06:36,909
Of those files keeping
the ledger efficient.

95
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:43,299
Finally, we secure everything with modern
protocols or the two for authentication.

96
00:06:43,299 --> 00:06:50,710
The WTS for session management,
TLS 1.34, encrypted communication.

97
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,864
Together, these technologies give
us both power and practicality.

98
00:06:56,364 --> 00:07:00,714
Our architecture is layered for the
clarity and the scalability at the top.

99
00:07:00,714 --> 00:07:06,174
Presentation layer exposes the
rest and drop graph ql APAs

100
00:07:06,174 --> 00:07:07,854
Enterprises can integrate easily.

101
00:07:08,484 --> 00:07:10,674
The next one is application layer.

102
00:07:10,704 --> 00:07:15,444
It contains the business logic
in the form of smart contracts,

103
00:07:15,744 --> 00:07:19,134
what Hyperledger calls chain code.

104
00:07:19,674 --> 00:07:27,504
And the con layer, con sense layer
ensures the agreement using the PFBT and

105
00:07:27,504 --> 00:07:35,754
the data layer combines the blockchain
metadata, IPFF, IP IPFS payloads and the

106
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:39,534
ready caches for the for fast retrieval.

107
00:07:40,404 --> 00:07:44,634
And at the base infrastructure layer runs.

108
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:50,129
On the Kubernetes clusters across the
availability dunes for the failover and

109
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:56,309
the scaling, each layer specialized,
but together they form a resilient hole.

110
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,919
We didn't jump straight into production
in the phase one, we built a proof

111
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:05,499
of concept, which is basically
crowd operations consensus testing

112
00:08:05,794 --> 00:08:10,114
and performance benchmarking that
validated the blockchain potential.

113
00:08:10,594 --> 00:08:12,154
In phase two, we.

114
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:16,879
Piloted with the real workloads and
developing smart contracts and the

115
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,499
optimizing throughput, we also deployed
the attribute based encryption.

116
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,989
Finally in the phase three phase of
production, building infrastructure

117
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:31,099
as a code, and setting up monitoring
with the different tools and

118
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,829
designing disaster recovery processes.

119
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,930
And this strategy changed the
journey, minimized the risks, and

120
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,940
ensure the enterprise readiness.

121
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:46,280
3090 9.9 percentage, 60 percentage.

122
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,760
The results are enter enterprise grade.

123
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:54,430
Our platform processes, or the 3000
transactions per second delivers

124
00:08:54,430 --> 00:09:01,150
99.9 percentage of time and includes
the data access by 60 percentage.

125
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,939
But the performance only the part of the
inventory compliance is automated and

126
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:13,689
smart contracts enforce retention policies
and every change is logged immutably.

127
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,875
In short, we didn't just
match the traditional MDM.

128
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:23,595
We exceeded in this, in scale and
reliability and trustworthiness.

129
00:09:24,095 --> 00:09:25,985
Security implementation.

130
00:09:25,985 --> 00:09:32,400
How security implemented in
defense, in depth a S 2 56 at

131
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,820
rest and the TLS 1.3 in transit.

132
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:42,630
We protect the data at two levels,
a s 2 56 encryption for storage and

133
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,510
TLS 1.3 for all the communication.

134
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:50,640
This ensures both the stored and
the transmitted data for secure.

135
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:53,219
And the second one is digitals.

136
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:58,829
Every transaction is digitally signed
and so we know what exactly who

137
00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:04,665
performed it and can be prevent further
remediation and zero knowledge proofs.

138
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:08,714
And for highly institute
operations we use.

139
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,650
Zero knowledge proofs.

140
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:14,849
This lets someone to prove
they are authorized without

141
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:16,920
revealing the actual data.

142
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,014
It's a security without
flexible or exposure.

143
00:10:20,194 --> 00:10:24,064
Instead of static rules, we use
the attributes based encryption.

144
00:10:24,064 --> 00:10:30,544
For example, only doctors with oncology
specialization and active license can

145
00:10:30,544 --> 00:10:35,999
access the oncology data policies drive
access, not the manual permissions.

146
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:39,409
The second one is dynamic
policy evaluation.

147
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:44,019
Access is evaluated in, if
someone's status is changed,

148
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,029
their access changes instantly.

149
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:47,679
No manual updates are needed.

150
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:54,139
Immutable, all access events are logged
immutably on the blockchain preventing

151
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:59,329
that, providing the regulator Reg Regulat
with the tamper proof Oddity system.

152
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:02,199
Third one is to treat me medication.

153
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:04,149
DDOS protection.

154
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:10,599
We use multi-level rare limiting
and failover to observe the of the

155
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:12,759
service attempts without downtime.

156
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:15,189
Insider threat prevention.

157
00:11:15,219 --> 00:11:17,799
The second one is in
insider threat prevention.

158
00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:22,779
No single administrator can override
the system because the blockchain

159
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:24,789
requests distributed consensus.

160
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:28,185
Even insider attacks are prevented.

161
00:11:28,635 --> 00:11:31,005
The third one is data leakage prevention.

162
00:11:31,335 --> 00:11:38,115
We integrated enterprise gate DLP tools
to stop the unauthorized data extraction,

163
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:41,355
adding it another layer of the safety.

164
00:11:41,855 --> 00:11:45,665
Data retention policies is the
automated compliance framework.

165
00:11:45,695 --> 00:11:50,855
Within that data retention policies,
the smart contracts automatically

166
00:11:50,855 --> 00:11:52,685
enforce the retention rules.

167
00:11:52,685 --> 00:11:55,655
No manual cleanups, no mis deadlines.

168
00:11:56,135 --> 00:12:00,245
Then the second one is comprehensive
access, logging, even accesses

169
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:06,155
logged mutable on the blockchain,
creating a reliable audit trail.

170
00:12:06,605 --> 00:12:08,640
And the third one is
complete data lineage.

171
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:13,695
We can trace the data across
its entire life cycle.

172
00:12:13,995 --> 00:12:17,385
Who created it, who modified
it where it is used?

173
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:22,635
Suppose the right to be forgotten
with the cryptographic deletion,

174
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:25,245
then HIPAA compliance and enhance it.

175
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:30,135
Protection for the sensitive
health information such compliance,

176
00:12:30,345 --> 00:12:35,925
building suppression of the duties,
ensuring financial accountabilities.

177
00:12:36,425 --> 00:12:37,835
Blue green deployments.

178
00:12:37,895 --> 00:12:41,300
We run two identical production
in environment side by side.

179
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:46,745
When the updates are needed, we switch
the traffic from blue to green, ensuring

180
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:48,695
the zero downtime, and then cany.

181
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:55,235
Religious new smart contracts are deployed
fast to the small subset of the no.

182
00:12:55,685 --> 00:13:01,745
If issues appears, we can roll back
automatically before the problem spreads.

183
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:03,245
Then future flags.

184
00:13:03,245 --> 00:13:04,220
Third one is future flags.

185
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:09,240
We can turn the futures on or
off selectively in production.

186
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,160
This lets us test the real world
behavior without putting the entire

187
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,980
system at risk monitoring and
observability the CPU and memory and

188
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,380
disc, and the network access for all.

189
00:13:22,395 --> 00:13:22,615
No.

190
00:13:23,265 --> 00:13:28,454
And predictor Analytics helps us
spot problems before they cause the

191
00:13:28,454 --> 00:13:31,064
outages and application metrics.

192
00:13:31,064 --> 00:13:33,105
The second one is application metrics.

193
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:38,505
We measure the transaction throughput,
latency, error rates, and business KPAs.

194
00:13:39,314 --> 00:13:43,995
Then the third one is block saying
basic metrics, and we monitor the

195
00:13:43,995 --> 00:13:49,964
consensus participation and blockchain
propagation times and chain growth

196
00:13:49,964 --> 00:13:52,725
rates to ensure the ledger itself.

197
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,660
Is running smoothly.

198
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,710
Incident response, how the
incidents are tracked and how the

199
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,930
incidents responses are captured.

200
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:07,260
Automated detection, machine learning and
anatomy detection, smart detection spot,

201
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,020
usually activity escalation procedures.

202
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,645
We have clear escalation paths
and automated notifications.

203
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:18,040
The right people are elected quickly.

204
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,560
Support motion buses post process.

205
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,680
Every incident is thoroughly
analyzed and lessons are added to

206
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,020
our runbooks and making the systems
smarter and stronger over the time.

207
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,440
And to conclude the future data management
is distributed, encrypted, and immutable.

208
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,140
Blockchain based MDM
is no longer a theory.

209
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,690
It's running in production
today, solving real challenges.

210
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,850
It gives the enterprises safe.

211
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,280
Platform that is faster, more
secure, more compliant than

212
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,380
the legacy systems at LabCorp.

213
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:58,540
This journey has just begin, but the
results already show the tremendous value.

214
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,920
I hope today's session give you
very clear picture that way the

215
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:08,020
blockchain D matters, and how it can
help your organizations build res

216
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,470
resilient future ready data platforms.

217
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:12,250
Thank you.
