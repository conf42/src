1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,110
Hello.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:01,890
Hi everyone.

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,670
Good afternoon.

4
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,400
it's pleasure to be here today.

5
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,810
My session is about very exiting
area, using the blockchain technology

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,730
to reinvent master data management.

7
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,230
Where does this matter?

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,320
Because master data is like a patient
identities in healthcare or customer, and

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,015
the product data in enterprise systems is
a backbone of all the digital operations.

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,189
If this foundation is insecure and
consistent and reliable, everything

11
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:31,709
build on top of it becomes fragile.

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:37,800
In my role at LabCorp, I have worked
hands-on with these challenges and I

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,450
will show how we solve them by combining
the blockchain with the enterprise MBM.

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,800
By the end, you will see how
the distributed, immutable, and

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,430
encrypted platforms can transform
enterprise data management.

16
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,150
What are the traditional MDM chart
data consistency issues with the

17
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:01,620
traditional MDM and the security
vulnerabilities and performance

18
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,349
bottleneck in compliance complexity.

19
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,780
Traditional MDM started simple,
mostly as a database Consolidation

20
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,250
are data consolidation.

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,830
But modern enterprises operates across
multiple geographies and multiple

22
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,410
clouds and dges of the applications.

23
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,260
That creates four big pain
points, data consistency.

24
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,910
The if the two systems update, the
customer recorded the same time, you

25
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,310
often get the conflicts are drift.

26
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,560
Second is security.

27
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,760
Centralized.

28
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:39,270
MDM is a huge target, one breach.

29
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,380
under the attacker controls
all the master data.

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,950
Then the third one is,
which is performance.

31
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,820
As a data grows exponentially,
systems slows down.

32
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,410
And the fourth one, final one
is compliance competencies.

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,930
regulated industries like
healthcare and finance, requests,

34
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,900
detailed audit trails and lineage.

35
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,880
Most legacy systems will these
futures on or afterwards.

36
00:02:09,435 --> 00:02:11,924
So she makes them fragile.

37
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:16,515
These challenges show us
why we need new foundation.

38
00:02:16,545 --> 00:02:20,565
Blockchain is for mainly four
categories, immutability and

39
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:25,635
consensus driven updates, and built in
cryptographic security and transparency.

40
00:02:26,174 --> 00:02:29,864
Blockchain directly addresses
these four pain points.

41
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:34,695
First one is immutability
means that once, once data is

42
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:36,614
started, it can be tampered with.

43
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,510
That is automatic.

44
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,600
Second one is consensus means that no
single system decides multiple nodes

45
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,820
must agree before the data changes, which
removes the single points of the failure.

46
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,410
The third one is built in security
through cryptography, ensures

47
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,470
authenticity and confidentiality.

48
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,810
And final one is transparency.

49
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,739
Every participant can see and
verify the state of the data.

50
00:03:06,435 --> 00:03:13,035
In short, blockchains DNA is natural
fit for the problems of MDM faces today.

51
00:03:13,635 --> 00:03:18,464
In traditional systems, this
means keeping the logs and backups

52
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,954
and complex access monitoring.

53
00:03:21,644 --> 00:03:24,644
but in the blockchain,
immutability is built in.

54
00:03:24,734 --> 00:03:29,790
Once the transaction is written, it's
mathematically locked into the chain.

55
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,810
If anyone tries to change it, the system
will reject it because the cryptographic

56
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:43,470
ash no longer matches these turns audit
trails from the complex manual process

57
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:51,120
into something automatic under tramp
proof consensus is about the agreement.

58
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,190
In centralized system.

59
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,720
The database administrator or single
system can approve the changes.

60
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,200
That's a convenient but risky act.

61
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:07,140
With the blockchain, multiple independent
nodes must agree on the change.

62
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:15,030
We use a practical Biogen time
fault tolerance mechanism, which

63
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,964
can tolerate even third, one.

64
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:23,370
Third of the nodes being
compromised, still remain reliable.

65
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,710
This critical for.

66
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:27,795
Resilience.

67
00:04:27,855 --> 00:04:33,675
It means the platform can withstand
failures and cyber attacks

68
00:04:33,765 --> 00:04:37,005
are insider threats and skill.

69
00:04:37,245 --> 00:04:38,685
Deep data, trustworthy.

70
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:45,765
Every transaction is signed with a digital
signature, sadly, who performed it.

71
00:04:47,235 --> 00:04:51,525
Data is encrypted both in
the rest and in the transit.

72
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:59,550
So that's much stronger and simple
than managing thousands of individual

73
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:05,340
keys in short securities over
into the fabric of the system.

74
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:11,070
Transparency is about the trust
in many industries and disputes

75
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,660
arise because each party maintains
their own version of the truth.

76
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:21,510
For example, in supply chains, one
partner might claim and update.

77
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:25,905
Was made while another
says that it wasn't.

78
00:05:26,505 --> 00:05:33,135
With the blockchain, everyone who has
access to see sees the same verified

79
00:05:33,135 --> 00:05:38,565
ledger that reduces the disputes,
increases the collaboration, and builds

80
00:05:38,565 --> 00:05:41,955
confidence across teams and organizations.

81
00:05:42,195 --> 00:05:45,469
Transparency doesn't mean loss of privacy.

82
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:51,345
Data is encrypted, but the fact
that the transaction is happened

83
00:05:51,345 --> 00:05:54,495
is visual to authorize parties.

84
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,760
Hyperledger Fabric is the one
of the thing, and attribution

85
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,830
based encryption is another one.

86
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:09,150
IPFS is for large storage, large
data storage, and work to J-W-T-T-L-S

87
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,310
1.3 for the modern security.

88
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,135
So we build our MDM platform
only carefully selected.

89
00:06:16,305 --> 00:06:23,215
Stack at the core is a Hyperledger
FA fabric, a permissioned blockchain.

90
00:06:23,895 --> 00:06:27,825
Ideal for enterprise use
for fine-grained access.

91
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:34,215
We use attribute waste encryption, which
enforces the policy, set the data level

92
00:06:34,575 --> 00:06:42,375
for storage, large data objects, going
to IPFS and a PPP two P file system.

93
00:06:42,555 --> 00:06:47,145
And while the blockchain only keeps
the cryptographic fingerprints.

94
00:06:48,045 --> 00:06:51,405
of those files keeping
the ledger efficient.

95
00:06:51,555 --> 00:06:57,795
Finally, we secure everything with modern
protocols or the two for authentication.

96
00:06:57,795 --> 00:07:05,205
The WTS for session management,
TLS 1.34, encrypted communication.

97
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:10,360
Together, these technologies give
us both power and practicality.

98
00:07:11,925 --> 00:07:16,605
Our architecture is layered, for the
clarity and the scalability at the top.

99
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:22,065
Presentation layer exposes the
rest and drop graph ql APAs

100
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:23,745
Enterprises can integrate easily.

101
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,565
The next one is application layer.

102
00:07:26,594 --> 00:07:31,335
It contains the business logic
in the form of smart contracts,

103
00:07:31,635 --> 00:07:35,025
what Hyperledger calls chain code.

104
00:07:35,565 --> 00:07:43,395
And the con layer, con sense layer
ensures the agreement using the PFBT and

105
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:51,645
the data layer combines the blockchain
metadata, IPFF, IP IPFS payloads and the

106
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:55,424
ready caches for the for fast retrieval.

107
00:07:56,294 --> 00:08:00,525
And at the base infrastructure layer runs.

108
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:06,630
On the Kubernetes clusters across the
availability dunes for the failover and

109
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:12,810
the scaling, each layer specialized,
but together they form a resilient hole.

110
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,970
We didn't jump straight into production
in the phase one, we built a proof

111
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:23,315
of concept, which is basically
crowd operations, consensus testing

112
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,930
and performance benchmarking that
validated the blockchain potential.

113
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,970
In phase two, we.

114
00:08:30,315 --> 00:08:34,695
Piloted with the real workloads and
developing smart contracts and the

115
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:39,315
optimizing throughput, we also deployed
the attribute based encryption.

116
00:08:39,735 --> 00:08:44,805
Finally in the phase three phase of
production, building infrastructure

117
00:08:44,805 --> 00:08:49,845
as a code, and setting up monitoring
with the different tools and

118
00:08:49,935 --> 00:08:52,575
designing disaster recovery processes.

119
00:08:52,935 --> 00:08:57,675
And this strategy changed the
journey, minimized the risks, and

120
00:08:57,675 --> 00:08:59,685
ensure the enterprise readiness.

121
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:05,025
3090 9.9 percentage, 60 percentage.

122
00:09:05,355 --> 00:09:07,995
The results are enter, enterprise grade.

123
00:09:07,995 --> 00:09:13,665
Our platform processes, or the 3000
transactions per second delivers

124
00:09:13,665 --> 00:09:20,385
99.9 percentage of time and includes
the data access by 60 percentage.

125
00:09:20,655 --> 00:09:26,175
But the performance only the part of the
inventory compliance is automated and

126
00:09:26,175 --> 00:09:32,925
smart contracts enforce retention policies
and every change is logged immutably.

127
00:09:33,735 --> 00:09:38,110
In short, we didn't just
match the traditional MDM.

128
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:43,750
We exceeded in this, in scale and
reliability and trustworthiness.

129
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,700
Security implementation.

130
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:54,750
How, security implemented in
defense, in depth a S 2 56 at

131
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,170
rest and the TLS 1.3 in transit.

132
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:04,980
We protect the data at two levels,
a s 2 56 encryption for storage and

133
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,860
TLS 1.3 for all the communication.

134
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,990
This ensures both the stored and
the transmitted data for secure.

135
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,569
And the second one is digitals.

136
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:21,180
Every transaction is digitally signed
and so we know what exactly who

137
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:27,750
performed it and can be prevent further
remediation and zero knowledge proofs.

138
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,800
And for highly institute
operations we use.

139
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:33,735
Zero knowledge proofs.

140
00:10:33,795 --> 00:10:37,935
This lets someone to prove
they are authorized without

141
00:10:37,935 --> 00:10:40,005
revealing the actual data.

142
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:43,455
It's a security without
flexible or, exposure.

143
00:10:43,635 --> 00:10:47,505
Instead of static rules, we use
the attributes based encryption.

144
00:10:47,505 --> 00:10:53,985
For example, only doctors with oncology
specialization and active license can

145
00:10:53,985 --> 00:10:59,440
access the oncology data policies drive
access, not the manual permissions.

146
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,850
The second one is dynamic
policy evaluation.

147
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,310
Access is evaluated in, if
someone's status is changed,

148
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,320
their access changes instantly.

149
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,970
No manual updates are needed.

150
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,080
Immutable,

151
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:20,700
all access events are logged immutably
on the blockchain preventing that,

152
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,500
providing the regulator Reg Regulat
with the tamper proof Oddity system.

153
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,849
Third one is to treat me medication.

154
00:11:29,849 --> 00:11:31,800
DDOS protection.

155
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:38,250
We use multi-level rare limiting
and failover to observe the of the

156
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,410
service attempts without downtime.

157
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,839
Insider threat prevention.

158
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,449
The second one is in
insider threat prevention.

159
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,430
No single administrator can override
the system because the blockchain

160
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,439
requests distributed consensus.

161
00:11:53,385 --> 00:11:56,205
even insider attacks are prevented.

162
00:11:56,655 --> 00:11:59,025
The third one is data leakage prevention.

163
00:11:59,355 --> 00:12:06,135
We integrated enterprise gate DLP tools
to stop the unauthorized data extraction,

164
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,375
adding it another layer of the safety.

165
00:12:10,665 --> 00:12:14,475
Data retention policies is the
automated compliance framework.

166
00:12:14,505 --> 00:12:19,665
Within that data retention policies,
the smart contracts automatically

167
00:12:19,665 --> 00:12:21,495
enforce the retention rules.

168
00:12:21,495 --> 00:12:24,465
No manual cleanups, no mis deadlines.

169
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:29,055
Then the second one is comprehensive
access, logging, even accesses

170
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:34,965
logged mutable on the blockchain,
creating a reliable audit trail.

171
00:12:35,415 --> 00:12:37,449
And the third one is
complete data lineage.

172
00:12:38,085 --> 00:12:42,975
We can trace the data across,
its entire life cycle.

173
00:12:43,275 --> 00:12:46,665
Who created it, who modified
it where it is used?

174
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:51,915
Suppose the right to be forgotten
with the cryptographic deletion,

175
00:12:52,395 --> 00:12:54,525
then HIPAA compliance and enhance it.

176
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:59,415
Protection for the sensitive
health information such compliance,

177
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:05,205
building suppression of the duties,
ensuring financial accountabilities.

178
00:13:06,975 --> 00:13:08,385
Blue green deployments.

179
00:13:08,444 --> 00:13:11,850
We run two identical production
in environment side by side.

180
00:13:12,345 --> 00:13:17,295
When the updates are needed, we switch
the traffic from blue to green, ensuring

181
00:13:17,295 --> 00:13:19,245
the zero downtime, and then cany.

182
00:13:19,574 --> 00:13:25,785
Religious new smart contracts are deployed
fast to the small subset of the no.

183
00:13:26,235 --> 00:13:32,295
If issues appears, we can roll back
automatically before the problem spreads.

184
00:13:32,505 --> 00:13:33,795
Then future flags.

185
00:13:33,795 --> 00:13:34,770
Third one is future flags.

186
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:40,380
We can turn the futures on or
off selectively in production.

187
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,300
This lets us test the real world
behavior without putting the entire

188
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:51,120
system at risk monitoring and
observability the CPU and memory and

189
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,520
disc, and the network access for all.

190
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:53,755
No.

191
00:13:54,405 --> 00:13:59,594
And predictor Analytics helps us
spot problems before they cause the

192
00:13:59,594 --> 00:14:02,204
outages and application metrics.

193
00:14:02,204 --> 00:14:04,245
The second one is application metrics.

194
00:14:04,485 --> 00:14:09,645
We measure the transaction throughput,
latency, error rates, and business KPAs.

195
00:14:10,454 --> 00:14:15,135
Then the third one is block saying
basic metrics, and we monitor the

196
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:21,104
consensus participation and blockchain
propagation times and chain growth

197
00:14:21,104 --> 00:14:23,865
rates to ensure the ledger itself.

198
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,800
Is running smoothly.

199
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,850
Incident response, how the
incidents are tracked and how the

200
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,070
incidents responses are captured.

201
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:38,400
Automated detection, machine learning and
anatomy detection, smart detection spot,

202
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,480
usually, activity escalation procedures.

203
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,105
We have clear escalation paths
and automated notifications.

204
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,500
The right people are elected quickly.

205
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,020
Support motion buses post process.

206
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:57,750
Every incident is thoroughly
analyzed and lessons are added to

207
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:03,090
our runbooks and making the systems
smarter and stronger over the time.

208
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:09,150
And to conclude the future data management
is distributed, encrypted, and immutable.

209
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,850
Blockchain based MDM
is no longer a theory.

210
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:16,980
It's running in production
today, solving real challenges.

211
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,140
It gives the enterprises safe.

212
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:24,569
Platform that is faster, more
secure, more compliant than

213
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:26,670
the legacy systems at LabCorp.

214
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:31,829
This journey has just begin, but the
results already show the tremendous value.

215
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,209
I hope today's session give you
very clear picture that way the

216
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:41,310
blockchain D matters, and how it can
help your organizations build res

217
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,760
resilient future ready data platforms.

218
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,540
Thank you.
