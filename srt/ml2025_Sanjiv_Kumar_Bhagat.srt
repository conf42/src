1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,960
Hello, friends.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,970
Welcome to the session Conference
42 Beyond Algorithms, and today's

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,700
session is Building Trust in AI
Enhanced Public Sector Systems.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,620
This session is about revolutionizing
government operations through

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,120
ethical AI integration.

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,215
So let's get started.

7
00:00:22,215 --> 00:00:28,515
Myself, I'm the presenter, Sanjiv
pga, and I have 21 years of experience

8
00:00:28,634 --> 00:00:31,784
working in it sector across all domains.

9
00:00:32,264 --> 00:00:36,614
I have currently I'm working for Amazon,
but prior to that I have worked in

10
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:42,324
different domains, higher education
for a huge part of my career and other

11
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,865
domains such as retail and supply chain.

12
00:00:46,095 --> 00:00:48,625
And yeah I have done more than 12.

13
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,810
A full lifecycle implementation
of ERP systems and currently

14
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,190
working on AI systems.

15
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:01,220
So let's get started on the topic,
the AI revolution in public sector.

16
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:08,420
What we have seen over the years is
that after the introduction of chat,

17
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,610
GPT and ai, artificial intelligence.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,660
Artificial intelligence existed
for many years, but with the

19
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,950
introduction of chat, GPD Open
ai, things have changed around us.

20
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:24,800
Things like how we do our day-to-day work
has changed a lot and how it has been

21
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,090
revolution revolutionizing the public
sector is what we are going to see here.

22
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:35,960
Now, we have seen 60% reduction in pre
previously incidents through enhanced

23
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,850
advanced protective frameworks.

24
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:42,830
And automated compliance monitoring,
which has been a major pain point.

25
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:48,590
Previously, we have also seen 75%
administrative overhead elimination,

26
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,600
streamlining workflows, workflows
with intelligent process automation.

27
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:00,200
We have also seen 82% enhanced
service accuracy, delivering precise.

28
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,700
Citizen Services.

29
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:08,210
Three critical pillars of the AI in public
sector is AI integration in public sector

30
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:12,920
is the first one is comprehensive data
privacy, which is of utmost important.

31
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:19,429
We know data is the new gold, and the
data privacy is of utmost importance.

32
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,220
So comprehensive data privacy is
one of the, key benefits of having

33
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,260
the AI integration in public sector.

34
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,250
This helps in adaptive
protection framework that

35
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,990
evolve with emerging threats.

36
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:38,230
Second is ethical algorithm, all
algorithmic fairness, which is

37
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:43,875
robust bias detection and mitigation
protocols across all demographics.

38
00:02:44,734 --> 00:02:48,195
The third one is system interability.

39
00:02:49,054 --> 00:02:52,954
Which is nothing but fully
transparent decision processes

40
00:02:53,255 --> 00:02:55,174
with accessible explanations.

41
00:02:56,255 --> 00:02:59,045
Let's move on to the next slide now.

42
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:00,665
Privacy protection framework.

43
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:07,424
In previous pre protection framework, the
three main components are comprehensive

44
00:03:07,424 --> 00:03:12,204
data audit, which is systematic
in inventory and classification of

45
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:14,214
all sensitive information sources.

46
00:03:14,814 --> 00:03:15,924
And repositories.

47
00:03:16,524 --> 00:03:21,474
The next is granular access control,
which is multifactor authentication,

48
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:25,874
like single sign-on and using mul
multiple factors, authentication

49
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:28,664
through phone or through text messages.

50
00:03:29,264 --> 00:03:32,924
Then role-based permissions with
traction logging and verification.

51
00:03:33,434 --> 00:03:35,234
And the third one is advance.

52
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:39,899
De-identification, which is
automated personal identifiable

53
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:44,789
information removal with cryptographic
safeguards and compliance.

54
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:52,269
Now let's look into each one of these
algorithmic fairness implementation.

55
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:57,729
This is all about defining the
fairness metrics, establishing

56
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:01,599
comprehensive standards tailored
to each demographic group.

57
00:04:01,929 --> 00:04:04,599
With quantifiable equity measures.

58
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:08,019
The next is measure outcomes.

59
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:10,279
In Measure outcomes.

60
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:15,859
What we look into is we conduct
rigorous data analysis across all

61
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:21,769
populations segments to identify
disparate impacts and effectiveness.

62
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:25,474
The third is stakeholder feedback.

63
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:30,574
Where we look into integrating
diverse community perspectives

64
00:04:30,634 --> 00:04:35,104
to validate real world equity
outcomes and guide improvements.

65
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:39,319
Now based on the feedback,
we also adjust the models.

66
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:45,259
We, so this is a ongoing circle, how
we make sure that the algorithm is

67
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:51,009
fairly implemented, which the last one
is adjust model based on the feedback.

68
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:55,809
So implement precise algorithm
refinements based on famous findings

69
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:58,059
to eliminate detected biases.

70
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,309
Moving on to the next one.

71
00:05:01,309 --> 00:05:07,549
Now interpretability mechanisms,
technical transparency, comprehensive

72
00:05:07,549 --> 00:05:09,619
system architecture, documentation.

73
00:05:09,964 --> 00:05:15,694
With accessible code repositories
and detailed process workflows is

74
00:05:15,694 --> 00:05:19,864
critical to interpretability of
the system of the AI interface.

75
00:05:20,374 --> 00:05:22,324
The second is decision explanation.

76
00:05:22,774 --> 00:05:27,574
Citizen friendly explanations
that translate complex algorithmic

77
00:05:27,604 --> 00:05:34,239
decisions into understandable
rationales with contextual examples.

78
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:37,269
The third one is human oversight.

79
00:05:38,049 --> 00:05:41,859
Robust review channels with
guaranteed human intervention

80
00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:48,039
options and clear appeal processes
for all automated decisions.

81
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:49,329
Next.

82
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:53,109
Looking at public sector
specific requirements.

83
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:57,699
Now these are the three main pillars
of the public sector requirements

84
00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:59,199
when it comes to AI integration.

85
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:04,419
The first one is enhanced
security, 40% higher resource

86
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:08,769
allocation and higher resource
allocation for critical protection.

87
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,119
Hardened infrastructure against
sophisticated cyber threats,

88
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:17,379
data sovereignty, compliance
across multiple jurisdictions.

89
00:06:17,904 --> 00:06:23,784
The next is frequent bias assessment,
mandatory quarterly audits with

90
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:29,844
documented remediation, multidisciplinary
stakeholder review panels with citizen

91
00:06:29,844 --> 00:06:36,204
representation, transparent publication
of assessment, findings and actions.

92
00:06:36,954 --> 00:06:42,984
The third one is regulatory compliance,
which is harmonized alignment across

93
00:06:42,984 --> 00:06:45,204
federal, state, and local requirements.

94
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,109
The third is second.

95
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,569
Next is comprehensive audit trails
for automated decisions, and the

96
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:57,549
last one is structured reporting to
overall committees and legislators

97
00:06:57,549 --> 00:06:59,049
and all other stakeholders.

98
00:07:00,049 --> 00:07:03,679
Now we have done some case studies and
here are the outcomes of the case study

99
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,229
of the AI integration in public sector.

100
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:13,489
Now what we have seen is that the
processing time is much less with the

101
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:18,619
AI integration compared to the usual
legacy in-house without AI integration.

102
00:07:19,474 --> 00:07:20,974
Next is error rates.

103
00:07:21,034 --> 00:07:23,734
The error rate is also significantly less.

104
00:07:24,484 --> 00:07:26,734
The third is public trust score.

105
00:07:26,884 --> 00:07:33,184
The public trust score, we see much higher
than a regular compared to AI processes.

106
00:07:33,664 --> 00:07:37,654
And the fourth one, which is the
biggest factor, is the service capacity.

107
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:42,784
Now having an AI integrated public
sector of businesses, we have seen the

108
00:07:42,784 --> 00:07:45,424
service capacity increase exponentially.

109
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:49,279
Now implementation roadmap.

110
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:55,269
The different steps of implementing the
AI interface is in the public sector,

111
00:07:55,269 --> 00:08:01,599
specifically is assessment, ethics,
audit of current systems to understand

112
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:05,949
how the current system works, what
are the challenges stakeholder need,

113
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:09,309
analysis, technical readiness, evaluation.

114
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:13,014
These are the three
assessments that we need to do.

115
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,234
The next is framework design.

116
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:21,234
In Framework design, the first step
is customize the ethical principles.

117
00:08:21,594 --> 00:08:27,594
Next is create governance structure,
and the third is define success metrics.

118
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:30,744
The next is implementation steps.

119
00:08:31,314 --> 00:08:35,274
The implementation steps
are in a iterative fashion.

120
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:40,780
It's phase technology integration,
staff capability building and

121
00:08:41,109 --> 00:08:42,489
public communication campaign.

122
00:08:43,869 --> 00:08:47,319
So these are the steps
for info implementation.

123
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:53,109
Other implementation roadmap,
success factors, there are

124
00:08:53,109 --> 00:08:55,149
four suc prime success factors.

125
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:57,339
The first is inclusive development.

126
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,959
Engage diverse stakeholders from
day one that is critical to the

127
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,369
success of the implementation.

128
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,899
Next is.

129
00:09:05,304 --> 00:09:11,244
Capability building continuous staff
ethics training program to make sure that

130
00:09:11,244 --> 00:09:17,304
they are able to support the application
and support the business processes

131
00:09:17,304 --> 00:09:19,405
or the system once it is implemented.

132
00:09:20,964 --> 00:09:22,885
Third is transparent communication.

133
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:29,484
Clear public explanation of AI usage
and if there are any challenges there,

134
00:09:29,544 --> 00:09:34,584
address those challenges early, earlier
in earlier stages of implementation.

135
00:09:35,244 --> 00:09:39,234
The last one would be adaptive
governance, which is regular

136
00:09:39,234 --> 00:09:40,974
review and refinement cycles.

137
00:09:41,064 --> 00:09:43,664
This makes stay aligned
with the customer needs.

138
00:09:43,904 --> 00:09:48,764
So adaptive governance is key
to sustain development and

139
00:09:48,764 --> 00:09:50,684
success of the implementation.

140
00:09:52,004 --> 00:09:53,324
Now, key takeaways.

141
00:09:54,284 --> 00:09:59,204
Ethical drive drives performance
organizations with strong

142
00:09:59,204 --> 00:10:02,804
ethical frameworks achieve
superior technical outcomes.

143
00:10:03,764 --> 00:10:06,224
Next is trust is measurable.

144
00:10:06,704 --> 00:10:13,724
Public confidence metrics directly
correlate with transparency mechanisms, so

145
00:10:13,754 --> 00:10:16,334
trust is definitely a measurable metric.

146
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:22,004
So over here, unique public requirements,
government AI demands specialized

147
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:24,164
security and fairness protocols.

148
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,614
And the fourth is continuous evolution.

149
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:33,409
Making sure that regular maintenance
and regular improvements are

150
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:39,719
done to stay in stay in base
with the developments happening.

151
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,939
Moving to the next slide,
and that was the last slide.

152
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:47,579
So thank you so much
for joining the session.

153
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:49,649
I hope you have a wonderful day.

154
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:50,759
Thank you.
