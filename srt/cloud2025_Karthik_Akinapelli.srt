00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,899
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,699
Greetings of the day.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,460
My name is Karthik Akinnapelli
and I hope you're all doing well.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,939
Today I'll be presenting a
phase 3 study findings which

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,009
revolutionized UTI treatment.

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,699
Here in this study, solopenum was
compared to suprafloxacin for treating

7
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:22,089
uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

8
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:29,255
This study tackled the critical issue
of raising antibiotic resistance

9
00:00:29,495 --> 00:00:33,824
and offered innovative strategies
for managing complex infections.

10
00:00:34,794 --> 00:00:39,015
The results provide valuable evidence
to guide treatment decisions in the

11
00:00:39,074 --> 00:00:41,104
evolving landscape of UTI resistance.

12
00:00:41,604 --> 00:00:45,914
Now, moving on to study design,
this phase 3 trial was a double

13
00:00:45,954 --> 00:00:51,974
blind multicenter study conducted
across 142 sites in 4 countries.

14
00:00:52,474 --> 00:00:57,474
It directly compared oral sulopenem
to suprafloxacin, focusing on

15
00:00:57,774 --> 00:01:01,924
real world clinical outcomes
in diverse healthcare settings.

16
00:01:02,424 --> 00:01:09,324
In terms of enrollment, the study included
a total of 1671 women with symptomatic

17
00:01:09,454 --> 00:01:11,534
uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

18
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:15,074
transcriptions, representing
the primary demographic most

19
00:01:15,114 --> 00:01:16,924
affected by these infections.

20
00:01:17,424 --> 00:01:22,614
This study addresses a critical healthcare
challenge, particularly in the US,

21
00:01:22,994 --> 00:01:28,604
where UUTIs account for approximately
30 million antibiotic prescriptions

22
00:01:28,664 --> 00:01:34,154
annually, making it one of the most common
infections requiring antibiotic treatment.

23
00:01:34,654 --> 00:01:39,284
Now in ciprofloxacin non
susceptible pathogens, sulopenum

24
00:01:39,344 --> 00:01:41,104
clearly demonstrated superiority.

25
00:01:41,505 --> 00:01:42,114
with 62.

26
00:01:42,474 --> 00:01:47,474
6 percent success rate
compared to ciprofloxacin's 26.

27
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:50,524
6%, with a highly significant p value.

28
00:01:51,024 --> 00:01:56,834
Now approximately 27 percent of urinary
pathogens in the study were found

29
00:01:56,834 --> 00:02:01,634
to be resistant to ciprofloxacin,
highlighting a significant challenge

30
00:02:01,794 --> 00:02:03,454
in current treatment options.

31
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:08,674
This underscores the crucial role
of sulopenum in bridging this gap

32
00:02:08,894 --> 00:02:13,284
by providing clinicians with an
essential alternative, particularly

33
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:17,884
for patients at a risk of treatment
failure and disease progression.

34
00:02:18,384 --> 00:02:23,124
Now, not only did sulopenum address
ciprofloxacin resistant infections.

35
00:02:23,684 --> 00:02:29,634
But it also demonstrated exceptional
efficacy, achieving an 80 percent clinical

36
00:02:29,664 --> 00:02:35,364
and microbiological cure rate in patients
with extensively drug resistant pathogens.

37
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:41,734
Those that are resistant to either beta
lactams, fluoroquinolones, or Bacrim, etc.

38
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:46,934
This highlights solopenem's potential as
a critical treatment option for patients

39
00:02:46,954 --> 00:02:49,354
with limited or no treatment alternatives.

40
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:54,134
Its ability to overcome multiple
resistance mechanisms presents a

41
00:02:54,394 --> 00:02:56,284
valuable oral treatment option.

42
00:02:57,084 --> 00:03:02,164
Potentially preventing hospitalizations
and reducing reliance on last resort

43
00:03:02,364 --> 00:03:04,674
option which is intravenous antibiotics.

44
00:03:05,174 --> 00:03:09,804
This makes solopenem a crucial treatment
option in managing resistant infections

45
00:03:10,084 --> 00:03:14,144
while improving patient outcomes
and healthcare resource utilization.

46
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:17,039
Now diving deep into
antibiotic resistance.

47
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:22,019
The analysis revealed that 32
percent of isolates were resistant

48
00:03:22,029 --> 00:03:27,560
to trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole,
which is Pactrim, whereas 18 percent

49
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,800
showed resistance to nitrofuranto, and
this is across all pathogen species.

50
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:38,119
This highlights a crucial evolution
in bacterial defense mechanisms,

51
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:43,359
representing a concerning shift in
antimicrobial susceptibility patterns.

52
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:48,640
These findings emphasize the urgent
need for novel therapeutic strategies

53
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,519
to combat emerging resistant trends and
ensure effective treatment options remain

54
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:57,649
available for managing uncomplicated UTIs.

55
00:03:58,149 --> 00:04:03,969
Now, beyond baseline resistance, the
study also revealed that 41 percent of

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,230
isolates that were initially susceptible
to ciprofloxacin developed resistance

57
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:13,519
post treatment, marking a significant
shift in susceptibility patterns.

58
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:19,289
This alarming rate of acquired
resistance not only jeopardizes future

59
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,119
treatment options for individual
patients, but also amplifies the

60
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:26,280
broader public healthcare crisis.

61
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:30,604
of antibacterial resistance.

62
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:35,835
These findings reinforce the urgent
need for alternative treatment

63
00:04:36,404 --> 00:04:42,144
strategies and enhanced antimicrobial
stewardship protocols to mitigate the

64
00:04:42,144 --> 00:04:44,184
accelerating threat of resistance.

65
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:49,854
Now, in the overall study population,
soloperium demonstrated statistical

66
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,724
non inferiority to ciprofloxacin.

67
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,229
overall study population includes
both susceptible and non susceptible

68
00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:00,889
pathogens to ciprofloxacin with
a clinical cure rate of 65.

69
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,930
6 percent for cilopenem compared to 67.

70
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,309
9 percent for ciprofloxacin.

71
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:10,059
Additionally, a secondary analysis
revealed that 18 percent of

72
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,809
patients developed asymptomatic
bacteria post treatment.

73
00:05:14,524 --> 00:05:17,064
with no significant difference
between treatment groups.

74
00:05:17,564 --> 00:05:22,604
This finding suggests that routine
follow up urine cultures in asymptomatic

75
00:05:22,664 --> 00:05:28,434
patients may not be clinically
significant, potentially helping to

76
00:05:28,434 --> 00:05:34,374
reduce unnecessary antibiotic exposure and
promote better antimicrobial stewardship.

77
00:05:34,874 --> 00:05:41,314
Now, sulopenum demonstrated a favorable
safety and tolerability profile, with mild

78
00:05:41,344 --> 00:05:46,894
and transient diarrhea as the only notable
adverse event, occurring in about 12.

79
00:05:46,934 --> 00:05:50,854
4 percent of patients in
sulopenum compared to 2.

80
00:05:50,854 --> 00:05:52,304
5 percent in ciprofloxacin.

81
00:05:52,804 --> 00:05:58,094
Very importantly, no serious adverse
events were attributed to the drug, and

82
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:01,154
discontinuation rates remained below 3%.

83
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:07,634
This exceptional safety profile positions
solipenum as a strong first line treatment

84
00:06:07,664 --> 00:06:14,834
option for UDTIs, particularly in diverse,
patient populations including elderly

85
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:17,444
patients and those with comorbidities.

86
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:23,434
Additionally, its minimum drug
interaction profile and lack of QT

87
00:06:23,434 --> 00:06:28,734
prolongation further reinforces its
suitability for widespread clinical use.

88
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:34,394
Now, sulopenum offers significant
therapeutic potential for the

89
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:39,084
63 percent of patients with beta
lactamase non susceptible infections.

90
00:06:39,584 --> 00:06:43,694
A population that was previously
had limited treatment options

91
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,484
due to antimicrobial resistance.

92
00:06:45,984 --> 00:06:48,784
The results are particularly
promising for the 13.

93
00:06:48,814 --> 00:06:52,994
5 percent of patients with
extended spectrum beta

94
00:06:52,994 --> 00:06:54,784
lactamase positive infections.

95
00:06:55,654 --> 00:07:01,044
As sulopenum provides a novel therapeutic
approach that effectively overcomes

96
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,914
traditional resistance mechanisms.

97
00:07:03,414 --> 00:07:10,394
This could play a crucial role in reducing
dependence on last resort antibiotics,

98
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:15,824
ultimately improving treatment
outcomes and antimicrobial stewardship.

99
00:07:16,324 --> 00:07:20,644
Coming to future directions,
further research is essential to

100
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:24,974
explore personalized treatment
approaches, gain deeper insights

101
00:07:24,974 --> 00:07:26,444
into resistance mechanisms.

102
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:30,609
and refined clinical
guidelines for UTI management.

103
00:07:31,429 --> 00:07:35,769
Additionally, conducting broader
studies in diverse populations will be

104
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:40,649
crucial to optimize treatment strategies
in the face of rising antibiotic

105
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:46,559
resistance, ensuring more effective
and targeted therapeutic interventions.

106
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:52,969
Now, finally, the key takeaways is that
Celebenum has shown strong efficacy

107
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:55,379
as an alternative to ciprofloxacin.

108
00:07:56,119 --> 00:08:02,259
particularly in drug resistant UTIs
with over 90 percent, supports its

109
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:08,169
role as a, sorry, with over a 90
percent success rates in ciprofloxacin

110
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:09,549
non susceptible infections.

111
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:14,039
It's excellent safety profile,
with minimal adverse events and low

112
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:18,789
discontinuation rates, supports its
role as a first line treatment option.

113
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:24,599
Moving forward, key priorities
include integrating these findings

114
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:29,159
into clinical guidelines, ongoing
resistance surveillance, and

115
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:32,819
developing targeted treatment
protocols based on patient specific

116
00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:35,859
factors and pathogen susceptibility.

117
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:40,999
These efforts are essential for
enhancing antimicrobial stewardship

118
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:46,889
and ensuring effective patient care
amid rising antibiotic resistance.

119
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:49,699
Thank you so much for
giving me this opportunity.
