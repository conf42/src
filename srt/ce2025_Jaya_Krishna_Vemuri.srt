1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:00,760
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,880
Hope everyone is doing great.

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,370
I'm Jayakrishna Vemuri.

4
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,650
I'm having more than 14 years of
experience in IT industry in implementing

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:14,479
high volume, high performance, large scale
investment banking products using multiple

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:21,160
database technologies like Oracle,
Sybase, Snowflake, Microsoft Azure.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:28,079
I have a strong expertise in front
to back trading applications on how

8
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,509
they work and how you just perform
the reconciliation process for the

9
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,329
regulatory and reporting needs.

10
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,589
As part of my job responsibilities,
I was primarily involved in building

11
00:00:39,599 --> 00:00:46,279
multiple applications using on
prem, hybrid and cloud technologies

12
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:48,379
with strong domain allies.

13
00:00:49,209 --> 00:00:53,769
Today, we're going to talk about
driving precision and efficiency of

14
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:57,749
cloud based reconciliation applications
in investment banking domain.

15
00:00:58,249 --> 00:01:01,949
as you all know, investment banking
industry operates on massive

16
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:06,939
scale of processing millions and
billions of transactions daily.

17
00:01:07,699 --> 00:01:11,259
accurate and timely reconciliation
of financial data is essential

18
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:15,249
for compliance, risk management,
and strategic decision making.

19
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:20,629
So this presentation will explore
the transformative power of Cloud

20
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:26,209
based reconciliation applications
and their impact on the investment

21
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,289
banking and IT industry.

22
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:29,779
Let's get into that.

23
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:34,089
So first, I'm going to talk
about the current challenges with

24
00:01:34,669 --> 00:01:36,459
traditional reconciliation process.

25
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:41,609
So Let's talk about how much time
consuming it's going to take.

26
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:47,329
So the legacy reconciliation often
involves, significant manual effort.

27
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:51,829
user has to perform the data analysis and
then prepare the data in the spreadsheet,

28
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:57,509
ingest the data, and once the data has
been loaded, so they have to perform the

29
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:03,749
Matching of the transaction between source
and target and identifying the expenses

30
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:06,279
and finally they prepare the reports.

31
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:13,249
This is so time consuming because
most of the process is manual and

32
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:17,009
even though they use tools, those
were not integrated properly.

33
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,594
So this can lead to delays in.

34
00:02:20,134 --> 00:02:22,324
Closing the financial periods many times.

35
00:02:22,824 --> 00:02:27,874
Second thing human errors as
we all do mistake at times.

36
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:33,334
So manual intervention always
increases the problem of errors.

37
00:02:34,124 --> 00:02:36,874
such as like when you're adding some data.

38
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:42,874
You do some mistakes and we miss some
transactions and then sometimes we

39
00:02:43,274 --> 00:02:49,424
perform the matching incorrectly and
then we may miss loading some data.

40
00:02:49,864 --> 00:02:55,904
So whenever we do this can
result in delaying the process,

41
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,084
this and all human address.

42
00:02:58,584 --> 00:03:04,074
And this can even potentially Go
into inaccurate financial statements.

43
00:03:04,314 --> 00:03:06,484
The third one is disjointed systems.

44
00:03:07,114 --> 00:03:11,644
So when we say disjointed systems
So this legacy systems, will have

45
00:03:11,694 --> 00:03:13,044
there'll be multiple systems.

46
00:03:13,074 --> 00:03:19,154
You have to integrate the systems We can't
integrate systems completely front to back

47
00:03:19,174 --> 00:03:25,164
end to end the reason is Each system will
have different software different product.

48
00:03:25,314 --> 00:03:30,864
Okay different external vendors like
Some people use this accounting software,

49
00:03:30,914 --> 00:03:32,914
custodian services, banking systems.

50
00:03:33,294 --> 00:03:38,034
So these kinds of fragmentation makes
it difficult to, get them into sync.

51
00:03:38,514 --> 00:03:42,784
Which leads to most of the
problems next delayed information.

52
00:03:43,784 --> 00:03:47,814
So most of the legacy systems
reconciliation systems

53
00:03:48,314 --> 00:03:50,624
Typically rely on batch updates.

54
00:03:50,704 --> 00:03:55,264
So which means they don't process
the data on real time So they

55
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:57,144
process the data on batches.

56
00:03:57,224 --> 00:03:58,774
They are they upload the data.

57
00:03:59,024 --> 00:04:03,654
So which means If user wanted to
perform the reconciliation, it will

58
00:04:04,204 --> 00:04:07,294
not be real time most of the times.

59
00:04:08,034 --> 00:04:12,764
So we can't perform the decision
making on the fly due to this

60
00:04:12,814 --> 00:04:14,694
outdated and incomplete information.

61
00:04:15,194 --> 00:04:18,314
And, the other point is
difficulty in audits.

62
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:23,144
So with all these problems, and
then, we don't have a proper end

63
00:04:23,144 --> 00:04:26,789
to end integrated systems, and
there are many manual and, it's.

64
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:33,049
So we can't audit each and every step
due to many manual interventions, human

65
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:36,319
errors, and then disjointed systems.

66
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:40,859
So auditing the reconciliation
process becomes so cumbersome,

67
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:45,429
which it didn't increase the time
and cost to complete the audit.

68
00:04:45,929 --> 00:04:49,759
These are the few challenges with
traditional reconciliation systems.

69
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:55,759
Now let's go into the features of
cloud based reconciliation system.

70
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:58,499
So first one is automated data matching.

71
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:04,739
So when we say automated data matching,
so we can design the cloud based platforms

72
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:09,384
to automate each and every process of
matching the transactions from Multiple

73
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:14,874
sources like sources can be banks, counter
parties, custodians and trading platforms.

74
00:05:15,634 --> 00:05:19,014
The system compares the internal
records with external records.

75
00:05:19,424 --> 00:05:24,024
So pre cancellation always performs
between two systems and, it

76
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:29,134
automatically flags if there are any
discrepancies for the user to review.

77
00:05:30,114 --> 00:05:34,554
once this is automated, the data matching,
so most of the problem will be solved.

78
00:05:35,054 --> 00:05:37,924
the second point is real
time data synchronization.

79
00:05:38,424 --> 00:05:43,374
With our new cloud evolving
technology, the data to be

80
00:05:43,554 --> 00:05:46,034
synced and updated in real time.

81
00:05:46,774 --> 00:05:51,224
So this means that as and when the
transaction occurs, as and when user

82
00:05:51,254 --> 00:05:56,634
posts something, there is, we can
do the reconciliation immediately.

83
00:05:56,724 --> 00:06:01,264
And, it can even speed up the
reconciliation process completely as

84
00:06:01,284 --> 00:06:02,774
we don't have to wait for anything.

85
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:07,489
As the system is system and data
is synchronized all the time.

86
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:12,209
And the third point is
integration of multiple systems.

87
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:19,259
So this is the key feature where these
platforms can seamlessly integrate with

88
00:06:19,369 --> 00:06:21,669
the various internal and external systems.

89
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:25,799
Any source system, accounting
system, custodian system.

90
00:06:25,809 --> 00:06:31,019
So if it is in cloud, if you configure
properly, so the things will be as

91
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:36,729
quick as possible and which will help us
break down the data silos and provide a

92
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,039
unified view of financial transactions.

93
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:43,949
and final thing is like reporting
once we perform the reconciliation,

94
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:46,129
obviously, we have to create the reports.

95
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:49,639
the cloud based systems
typically have powerful reporting

96
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:51,519
and analytic capabilities.

97
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:55,629
these tools allow firms to generate,
The comprehensive reports on the

98
00:06:55,629 --> 00:07:03,049
reconciliation process and highlight the
issues in real time are very quickly.

99
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:07,589
Reports can be customized as user
require, needs and they can be

100
00:07:07,609 --> 00:07:12,849
exported to other systems shared
with stakeholders and shared to

101
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,369
different, shared in multiple formats.

102
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:17,729
Everything can be done in a single click.

103
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:22,799
So once the report is unleashed,
and then the next thing is

104
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:25,249
audit trials and compliances.

105
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:31,549
So the most difficult part, is
audit trials and compliance.

106
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:36,349
So that too, for the financial
institution, maintaining accurate records

107
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:38,779
for regulatory reporting is very crucial.

108
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:42,749
So this cloud system maintains
the detailed audit trails of

109
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:46,514
all reconciliation activities
like Who made the changes?

110
00:07:47,014 --> 00:07:48,274
When it was done?

111
00:07:48,294 --> 00:07:49,424
How it was done?

112
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:52,054
If something is broken, how is it broken?

113
00:07:52,474 --> 00:07:57,404
All this will be properly audited
in the cloud based systems.

114
00:07:57,444 --> 00:08:01,384
This ensures complete transparency
and makes the process of auditing.

115
00:08:01,884 --> 00:08:02,784
More straightforward.

116
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:07,144
and machine learning and a
integration, which is a key

117
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:09,134
concept in any of the cloud stuff.

118
00:08:09,724 --> 00:08:14,444
So some of the advanced cloud
based reconstruction tools in cloud

119
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:16,969
incorporate machine learning and a.

120
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:21,259
These technologies can predict and
automatically resolve the discrepancies

121
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,089
based on historical patterns,
reducing human interventions, and

122
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:29,569
speeding up the process further
because it takes care of everything.

123
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:31,209
Those are the key features.

124
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:37,619
Let's come to the benefits of
cloud based reconciliation with

125
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:38,759
the features which we have.

126
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:41,909
First, increased efficiency.

127
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:43,679
So automating this.

128
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:49,339
Manual tasks like ingestion, data
matching, exception handling,

129
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:57,289
generating the reports and audit
trials, all this will be very quick.

130
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:01,519
Now, this leads to a quicker close
cycles and more timely decision making.

131
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:03,749
and reduce risk of errors.

132
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:08,439
So this old system, configure the
system properly, you develop something,

133
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:14,249
we produce it, this cloud platform
automate much of the reconciliation

134
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:15,869
process and reduce the manual entry.

135
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:19,869
The chances of human errors and
data mistakes are no more available

136
00:09:20,849 --> 00:09:25,229
except for the coding, of course,
which means our manual errors

137
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:27,759
are minimized more efficiently.

138
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:30,339
And now, enhanced collaboration.

139
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,879
Cloud platforms are accessible
from anywhere within Internet

140
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:39,589
connection, facilitating collaboration
across multiple teams or even

141
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:41,359
multiple regions and locations.

142
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:47,679
This is especially useful for investment
banks and financial firms with global

143
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:51,089
operations across teams working remotely.

144
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:53,629
Next, cost optimization.

145
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:58,029
The time savings from cloud based
reconciliation can translate into

146
00:09:58,069 --> 00:09:59,919
cost reductions, as expected.

147
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:05,409
Organizations can report around 60
percent faster monthly end closures.

148
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:08,859
So these month end reports,
month end closures are very

149
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,619
crucial for any financial form.

150
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:16,959
And they even realize approximately 50
percent in the manual introversion reduce

151
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:24,699
and the ability to reallocate 40 percent
of their savings in resource allocations

152
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:27,099
to improve the products even better.

153
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:31,289
So now, next point is better
complaints and transparency.

154
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:34,749
This cloud based reconciliation
systems are frequently updated to

155
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:37,129
meet changing regulatory requirements.

156
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:39,049
The built in audit trial features.

157
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:45,309
For this cloud provides clear visibility
into the reconstruction process making

158
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:52,529
it easier to comply with all regulatory
standards like GDPR and so on.

159
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:58,389
And major, very great benefit
is faster decision making.

160
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:02,739
With faster reconstruction cycles
and real time data updates,

161
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:05,979
decision making is, decision making.

162
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:11,764
Is very quick and this can rely on more
accurate and up to date financial data.

163
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:16,094
To inform business strategies
now, let's think about the

164
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:18,244
architecture of this reconciliation.

165
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:24,734
So If you if we just think any of the
reconciliation systems So data in this

166
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:29,744
we need to perform the load loading of
the data and then we have to build some

167
00:11:29,754 --> 00:11:34,714
reconciliation system and then we have
to perform the Some tool to validate

168
00:11:34,764 --> 00:11:40,314
and then we have to see some reporting
methodology It's like quite common, but

169
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:45,494
when it comes to cloud based thing, the
data engine, the system employs advanced

170
00:11:45,494 --> 00:11:50,054
APIs, excuse me, and connectors to
ingest the data from multiple sources.

171
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:53,714
That can include trade confirmations,
settlement transactions.

172
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,814
And, real time market fits.

173
00:11:56,314 --> 00:12:00,604
this features robust error handling
and data buffering capabilities.

174
00:12:01,294 --> 00:12:06,274
which ensures during peak hours, we
can queue the data than, breaking the

175
00:12:06,274 --> 00:12:09,354
system and go Oh, there's a huge data.

176
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:10,794
Oh, I can't handle the data.

177
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:11,424
Let's break it.

178
00:12:11,534 --> 00:12:17,634
let's ask users to push only little
more data on a batch of dates.

179
00:12:18,034 --> 00:12:19,344
So we don't have to do all of this.

180
00:12:19,844 --> 00:12:24,014
So the cloud based systems can
easily scale up and scale down

181
00:12:24,784 --> 00:12:26,564
if you architect it properly.

182
00:12:27,444 --> 00:12:28,784
That's the power of cloud based.

183
00:12:29,324 --> 00:12:34,104
And then once data is ingested, we
have to build a reconciliation engine.

184
00:12:34,604 --> 00:12:36,324
So what does this do?

185
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:39,984
That system can be a high
performance matching engine.

186
00:12:40,104 --> 00:12:44,454
So where we can configure the rules
and machine learning algorithms to

187
00:12:44,454 --> 00:12:48,554
perform multivariate reconciliation
across So any kind of data sources.

188
00:12:49,124 --> 00:12:54,254
Advanced pattern recognition
identifies complex expenses, while

189
00:12:54,994 --> 00:13:00,864
the intelligent AI handles routine
matches, escalating only the exceptions

190
00:13:00,894 --> 00:13:02,684
that require human interventions.

191
00:13:02,974 --> 00:13:08,314
And user can comment, annotate however
they want, they can make the changes, they

192
00:13:08,314 --> 00:13:10,494
can push the changes back to the system.

193
00:13:11,064 --> 00:13:15,094
So we can develop reconciliation in
such a way that it's more powerful

194
00:13:15,124 --> 00:13:22,084
for Front and back validations So
it's nothing but data processing and

195
00:13:22,084 --> 00:13:29,684
validation this sophisticated etl extract
transform language So this is a normal

196
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:36,539
etl system, but when it comes to cloud
it is so powerful by using automated

197
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:41,639
workflows, machine learning algorithms,
which can detect any anomalies,

198
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:47,019
built in validation rules, to ensure
the data quality and completeness.

199
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,169
and then issue resolution and reporting.

200
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:52,929
An integrated workflow management
system streamlines exception

201
00:13:52,939 --> 00:13:56,989
handling through automated routing
and collaborative resolution tools.

202
00:13:56,989 --> 00:14:02,139
The reporting layer leverages Business
intelligence capabilities to generate

203
00:14:02,229 --> 00:14:06,959
real time dashboards regulated
reports and Predictive analytics

204
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,759
that drives operational improvement.

205
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:15,909
So which means there is a issue We
can flag the issue and then send the

206
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:21,789
issue to corresponding user on an email
on Any kind of cloud based platform

207
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:27,689
where we can quickly check and then
perform the resolution accordingly.

208
00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:32,829
We can send the reports in
cloud as much faster as we need.

209
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:38,599
So that's the architecture now When
we do the when we do some kind of case

210
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:44,274
studies in the real world So so there
are some invest bank Is investment banks.

211
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:50,744
So when they use the cloud-based
platform, for their reconciliation, they

212
00:14:50,774 --> 00:14:53,114
within six months, they achieved 60.

213
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:55,044
60, not 60.

214
00:14:55,044 --> 00:14:59,834
It's 70% reduction in manual processing
errors, cutting reconciliation time

215
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:07,439
from 44 hours to less than 45 minutes,
and their accuracy rates sold to 99%.

216
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:11,649
While reconciliation related
operation cost decreased by 40%.

217
00:15:12,429 --> 00:15:19,199
So, more less operational cost, less
manual effort, more speedy approach.

218
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:23,499
So one of the company
have evolved with that.

219
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:27,919
So next, when it comes to hedge
funds, so a 10 billion hedge fund

220
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,389
revolutionized their portfolio
reconciliation through cloud technology.

221
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:36,009
The new system automatically resolves 92
percent of their position risk expenses.

222
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:41,519
within minutes compared to hours
when they do it perfectly or

223
00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:43,919
days if there are any mistakes.

224
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:48,479
Real time monitoring now flags 90
percent of potential issues before

225
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:51,029
they impact trading decisions.

226
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:54,619
This dramatically strengthening
their risk management framework.

227
00:15:55,499 --> 00:16:01,229
And, it is asset management company,
which is like 50 billion asset manager.

228
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,919
They streamlined the regulatory
reporting through this cloud technology

229
00:16:05,989 --> 00:16:11,179
reconciliation, daily reporting cycle
shortened from six hours to 90 minutes,

230
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:15,459
while accuracy improved from 96 to 99.

231
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:23,289
8%. The company now handles three
times the transaction volume.

232
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:29,299
more than what they used to handle
earlier with legacy applications.

233
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:34,459
this is the scalability and it can go
even 10 percent as 10 times as well.

234
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,239
So this is the cloud based and
then what is the future we can

235
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:43,629
even think of using an artificial
intelligence, what it will do.

236
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,879
So next generation AI transforms the
reconciliation through intelligent pattern

237
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:53,779
because Transcribed Recognization and
machine learning advanced algorithms

238
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,859
automate the complex matching while
real time anomaly detection prevents

239
00:16:57,944 --> 00:17:00,904
before they impact the operations.

240
00:17:01,594 --> 00:17:04,744
This reduces the manual
intervention by up to 80%.

241
00:17:05,674 --> 00:17:06,094
Yes.

242
00:17:06,314 --> 00:17:12,494
When AI comes, any similar activities can
be detected automatically and based on

243
00:17:12,494 --> 00:17:18,854
the historical data, it does, the pattern
matching and it speeds up the process.

244
00:17:19,804 --> 00:17:21,944
And we can use blockchain technology.

245
00:17:22,504 --> 00:17:29,101
This distributed ledger technology,
The reconciliation by creating

246
00:17:29,101 --> 00:17:33,491
a single source of truth, smart
contracts, automated verification,

247
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:37,451
while immutable audit trials,
enhanced transparency and compliance.

248
00:17:37,951 --> 00:17:40,311
Virtually eliminating the data
discrepancies between the parties.

249
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:44,221
The third point is data
analytics and visualization.

250
00:17:44,641 --> 00:17:49,911
Now, everything will be dashboards,
reports, hit a single click of button.

251
00:17:50,091 --> 00:17:53,371
They can just move from one
reconciliation to another reconciliation.

252
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:57,961
The interactive visualization that
highlights the trends and problems.

253
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:03,781
And it can even show us the predictive
models, forecast, potential issues,

254
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:09,941
which can be used for proactive
optimization of reconciliation workflows.

255
00:18:10,441 --> 00:18:14,341
So what are our key
takeaways and our next steps?

256
00:18:14,841 --> 00:18:20,571
So I believe we need to implement the
cloud based reconciliation solution

257
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:25,521
to reduce all this manual efforts
and, minimize the operation risk and

258
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,661
reallocate the valuable resources to.

259
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:33,411
Strategic initiatives than using
spreadsheets comparing taking more

260
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:39,281
time and second point is strengthen
the risk management established.

261
00:18:39,736 --> 00:18:44,416
Robust data governance frameworks
and automated validation process

262
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:47,676
to ensure 99 percent of accuracy.

263
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:51,026
This meets the regulatory requirements
and builds stakeholder stress.

264
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:56,156
Yes, as and when everything
is automated and validated.

265
00:18:57,066 --> 00:19:00,226
The chances of risk will be quite less.

266
00:19:00,726 --> 00:19:03,786
And next drive innovation leadership.

267
00:19:04,286 --> 00:19:09,766
Deliveries AI powered analytical and
blockchain technology to transform

268
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:13,656
the reconciliation from back office
function into a strategic advantage,

269
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:17,566
delivering the real time insights
and predictive capabilities.

270
00:19:18,516 --> 00:19:21,256
Yeah, it transforms everything.

271
00:19:21,756 --> 00:19:27,156
this is some, estimated changes
of the cloud based reconciliation

272
00:19:27,206 --> 00:19:28,746
in investment banking operation.

273
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:36,216
So it, as we talked, it reduces
around 75 percent of manual effort and

274
00:19:36,236 --> 00:19:39,846
improved accuracy in their systems.

275
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,156
And it lowered the cost,
operating costs also.

276
00:19:43,656 --> 00:19:45,596
So it's all savings.

277
00:19:46,056 --> 00:19:46,566
And,

278
00:19:46,616 --> 00:19:50,726
more efficient, more
savings, and, more scalable.

279
00:19:51,226 --> 00:19:55,126
And the conclusion, cloud based
reconciliation applications have

280
00:19:55,216 --> 00:19:58,976
revolutionized investment banking
operations, delivering up to 80

281
00:19:58,976 --> 00:20:04,226
percent reduction in processing
time, while ensuring unprecedented

282
00:20:04,576 --> 00:20:07,356
accuracy in financial data management.

283
00:20:07,856 --> 00:20:12,556
by leveraging intelligent automation and
real time analytics, companies are not

284
00:20:12,556 --> 00:20:18,166
only streamlining their operation, but
also uncovering valuable insights that

285
00:20:18,476 --> 00:20:23,606
drive the strategic decision making as the
financial landscape continues to evolve.

286
00:20:24,106 --> 00:20:29,246
Organizations that go with these
transformative solutions will be in a

287
00:20:29,246 --> 00:20:34,406
better position to scale efficiently by
maintaining the regulatory compliance

288
00:20:34,456 --> 00:20:37,116
and, capture new opportunities.

289
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:45,081
Very quickly in this competitive world,
which will make their company growth

290
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:52,901
go more success and scalable very
quick as cloud based reconciliation

291
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:57,701
systems can be scalable as easy
as possible, as quick as possible.

292
00:20:58,201 --> 00:20:59,311
And thank you.

293
00:20:59,811 --> 00:21:03,871
First of all, I would like to thank
you for giving me these opportunities.

294
00:21:04,371 --> 00:21:08,811
Thank you so much Con 42 for giving
me this opportunity and thank you for

295
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,511
listening to this great initiative.

296
00:21:11,611 --> 00:21:17,791
And I hope this gives you some kind
of more insight on reconciliation

297
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,201
processes by using cloud based systems.

298
00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:21,561
Thank you all.

299
00:21:21,951 --> 00:21:23,281
Have a wonderful day.
