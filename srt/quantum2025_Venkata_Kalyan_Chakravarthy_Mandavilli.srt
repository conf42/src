processing and structured data means.

48
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,319
SAP is helping to model, analyze
the customer interactions and also

49
00:03:09,619 --> 00:03:13,369
sure, also, gather the purchase
histories, the browsing patterns, and

50
00:03:13,369 --> 00:03:15,019
generate relevant product suggestions.

51
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:18,229
And let's see, demand forecasting
for inventory optimization.

52
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:20,869
SAP integrate times and series analysis.

53
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,619
External factors such as market
trends, seasonal variations,

54
00:03:24,619 --> 00:03:25,879
and social media sentiment.

55
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:29,899
Dark picture includes LSTM
Network to capture long term

56
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:31,669
dependencies in time series data.

57
00:03:32,374 --> 00:03:35,194
The systems typically
employ and symbol methods.

58
00:03:35,194 --> 00:03:40,174
Combining LLST and networks with
traditional RMI models achieving high

59
00:03:40,174 --> 00:03:46,024
forecast accuracy rates for short term
and medium term projections, demand

60
00:03:46,024 --> 00:03:50,944
forecasting and SAP is playing a
crucial role, the help of AI in this

61
00:03:50,954 --> 00:03:53,954
ERP World Extra Healthcare application.

62
00:03:54,454 --> 00:03:58,354
How it's helping care applications
with the AI optimization

63
00:03:58,954 --> 00:04:00,364
patient admission prediction.

64
00:04:01,204 --> 00:04:04,984
SAP healthcare AI solution utilize
multi-variate regression models and

65
00:04:04,984 --> 00:04:10,234
classification algorithms to predict
admission rates with remarkable accuracy.

66
00:04:10,804 --> 00:04:13,564
These systems analyze
historical admission data.

67
00:04:14,014 --> 00:04:19,054
Seasonal illness patterns, local event
calendar, population demography, and

68
00:04:19,054 --> 00:04:21,125
current facility utilization rates.

69
00:04:21,604 --> 00:04:26,015
It clearly says that it is collecting
the illness patterns and also the local

70
00:04:26,554 --> 00:04:31,184
event calendars with the helping patient
admission predictions to the hospitals.

71
00:04:31,244 --> 00:04:33,729
And next care enhancement early.

72
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:36,729
This is a detection, leverages
natural language processing to

73
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:41,114
mine un unstructured clinical notes
alongside structured patient data.

74
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:46,209
The system employs transfer based models
for text analysis, anomaly detection

75
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:50,889
algorithm to identify clear inpatient
metrics and secure data processing

76
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:53,019
that maintains the HIPAA compliances.

77
00:04:53,499 --> 00:04:57,339
It's also helping the hospitals
to make sure they're following

78
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,219
the HIPAA compliance processes by.

79
00:05:01,044 --> 00:05:05,594
Following patterns which I provided
with the help of SAP clinical impact

80
00:05:05,754 --> 00:05:10,614
facilities employing advanced NLP
for a clinical nurse analysis report.

81
00:05:10,674 --> 00:05:14,124
Early introduction, increase for
high risk condition, corresponding

82
00:05:14,124 --> 00:05:18,114
reductions in acute admission per
monitor condition, translating to

83
00:05:18,114 --> 00:05:20,004
average cost reduction per patient.

84
00:05:20,504 --> 00:05:26,054
It is like also helping in the cost
reduction and high risk introductions

85
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:28,654
eye finding acute admissions.

86
00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:30,859
Okay, now let's see.

87
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:32,839
SAP integration with ai.

Manufacturing facilitates employing
advance and predict to maintenance show

96
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:04,419
unplanned downtime reductions up to 50%.

97
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:09,129
And maintenance cost decrease of what,
10 to 40% compared to traditional

98
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:10,404
scheduled maintenance approaches.

99
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:17,269
These systems typically monitor thousands
of sensor per facility with edge

100
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:22,309
computing, noise processing, terabytes
of equipment, elementary data daily.

101
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:27,069
Here we can clearly see that SAP
integration with AI is helping good

00:07:10,989 --> 00:07:13,774
Enabling target process implements means.

114
00:07:14,274 --> 00:07:19,844
The quality of the images increased and
also AI is going to analyze the neural

115
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:22,004
network analysis images, detect defects.

116
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:27,134
If you see any precision exceeding human
inspection, production integration,

117
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:33,014
real-time feedback to manufacturing system
enables immediate process adjustments.

118
00:07:33,914 --> 00:07:37,994
CN based inspection system detect
up to 99% of surface defects and

119
00:07:37,994 --> 00:07:42,534
structural cy compared to 80 to
90% per traditional machine vision

120
00:07:42,534 --> 00:07:43,854
systems and human inspectors.

121
00:07:44,454 --> 00:07:47,544
The economic impact translate to
documented disease in customer

122
00:07:47,544 --> 00:07:51,504
reported quality issues and
assert variant claim reduction.

123
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:57,744
So it is also helping to reduce the
claim reductions and decrease in the

124
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:00,084
customer reported quality issues.

125
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,739
Finance and banking applications.

126
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:05,079
So finance and banking
are the most important.

127
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,959
And let's see, the fraud detection,
the document understanding

128

using, aI platforms are AI apps.

131
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:22,719
So instead of talking to the human, the
AI will provide all the informations

132
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:26,979
and it is the banks and everyone is
saying that is an accurate information.

133
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:30,849
Let's see how it is going to detect
the fraud graph neural networks

134
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:33,879
model relationship between the
entities to identify suspicions.

135
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:38,049
Pattern means it's also detect the
fraud if any unauthorized persons

136
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,549
are trying to use your accounts.

137
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:40,609
