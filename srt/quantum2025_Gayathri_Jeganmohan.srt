00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,560
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:05,430
Welcome to Quantum 42, quantum
Computing 2025 conference.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,060
I'm Ga Jar Mohan.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,850
I am a software engineer at
Microsoft and I'm gonna talk

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,430
about quantum powered iot today.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:18,810
How iot is gonna revolutionize by
the quantum computing concepts.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,150
So it's gonna change the entire
intelligence and security in iot space.

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,710
So let's get started.

9
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:31,955
So the first thing I wanna talk about is,
of course, like what is quantum computing?

10
00:00:32,585 --> 00:00:36,845
In classical computers we
usually have like zeros in ones.

11
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:41,465
That's how we process it so that it
logical is always either zero or one.

12
00:00:41,735 --> 00:00:43,595
You can see in the left side the bit is.

13
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:47,535
The logic is if it is existed as
one, and if it doesn't, it's zero.

14
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:51,710
But in the cons, in the case of quantum
computing, in the concept of quantum

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,510
world, we have something called a qubits.

16
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,150
Qubits actually exist in
a state of superposition.

17
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:02,410
Which means that it can either exist
in a state of, in between zero and one.

18
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,160
So it can exist at zero
and one at the same time.

19
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,710
So how, what is it?

20
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,550
Actually make an impact because
in a classical computer, you can

21
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,670
see the way we solve the problem
is if we are entering a maze.

22
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,030
Okay.

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,220
If the left one is blocked or not.

24
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:18,700
Yeah.

25
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,470
We keep continuing once we hit the
block and then we come back and

26
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,090
then we go and try the next route.

27
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,870
So it is serialized because
of the state of zeros in once.

28
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,970
But in the case of quantum computing.

29
00:01:30,345 --> 00:01:34,665
You can compute these things very
parallelly because these can exist

30
00:01:34,665 --> 00:01:36,585
in the state of both zeros and ones.

31
00:01:36,945 --> 00:01:42,525
So in this way you can calculate
or solve a puzzle much faster than

32
00:01:42,525 --> 00:01:43,935
a classical computer would do.

33
00:01:44,685 --> 00:01:47,805
So there is also something called
as entanglement, which is a

34
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:49,275
concept in quantum computing.

35
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,320
It is the state of one
influence the other.

36
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,250
Basically, if you know that this
route is gonna be all gone, then

37
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,660
we don't even try that route.

38
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,940
We instead just cancel out those
possibilities and then just move

39
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,610
ahead so that you don't have
to, waste time in the compute.

40
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:08,329
So that is how quantum computing
is actually different from

41
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:09,500
the classical computing.

42
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:15,745
So how this is going to change the iot
space or any other space in general?

43
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,510
We will see that.

44
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,219
But first let's get into how we
are gonna focus on the iot space,

45
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:22,450
which is Internet of Things.

46
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:26,739
So Internet of Things is like any device
that is connected to internet, right?

47
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:26,741
But.

48
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:30,834
They also have a huge
bottleneck currently.

49
00:02:30,834 --> 00:02:33,744
So the bottleneck, bottleneck
can be in the categories of

50
00:02:33,774 --> 00:02:37,074
intelligence and security, and
that's what we're gonna target today.

51
00:02:37,374 --> 00:02:40,314
So the quantum computing
can help in these two areas.

52
00:02:40,644 --> 00:02:45,114
So if you wanna focus on intelligence
first, when we'll get into these two

53
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:48,924
subcategories, which is iot, data
analytics, and then IOT machine learning.

54
00:02:49,564 --> 00:02:51,854
So first is in the intelligence space.

55
00:02:51,854 --> 00:02:53,744
Let's get into the iot data analytics.

56
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:57,389
So internet of things
actually create a lot of data.

57
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:59,309
They are very unstructured.

58
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,539
They're very noisy.

59
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:05,020
We don't know where the device is coming,
how this sensor data can be made sense

60
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,410
because there's temperature coming,
pressure coming, and there's like whole

61
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:13,300
lot coming from one factory and there's
like lot coming every minute and second.

62
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,370
So the data is pretty huge.

63
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,090
So what does quantum computing
can do in this space?

64
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,330
What is the main purpose
of quantum computing?

65
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,770
It can actually analyze like
large set of unstructured data.

66
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,940
It can make sense out of it, and it
can actually be more efficient in

67
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,600
terms of space and time and memory
when compared to classical computers.

68
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,109
And also it can accelerate the
machine learning world because mission

69
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:45,209
learning environment has a unique
pattern where it needs to do multiple

70
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:46,679
computation at the same time, right?

71
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:47,879
So it can accelerate.

72
00:03:48,314 --> 00:03:52,734
The anomaly detection and also it can
improve the inferencing at the edge.

73
00:03:53,004 --> 00:03:53,904
So we'll get into that.

74
00:03:54,504 --> 00:03:58,604
And also iot analytics in this
specifically will it improves the

75
00:03:58,604 --> 00:04:02,804
pattern recognition because, the
quantum algorithms are very powerful.

76
00:04:02,804 --> 00:04:05,384
HSL algorithm and quantum
game means algorithm.

77
00:04:05,384 --> 00:04:09,764
They can find patterns in
very large exponential data.

78
00:04:09,924 --> 00:04:14,184
It can actually try to look for
the main component of details and

79
00:04:14,184 --> 00:04:18,084
then it can quickly find a pattern
of the data that you're looking

80
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:19,584
for and can give you an answer.

81
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:24,549
So an example would be Volkswagen using
a quantum algorithm to detect the traffic

82
00:04:24,549 --> 00:04:30,419
flow and also patterns like which area
is more densely traffic area in the

83
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:35,339
urban areas, and also can try to optimize
the traffic systems in that space.

84
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:39,819
Other big, advantage of
in the intelligence space

85
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:41,049
is the anomaly detection.

86
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:45,989
So every time when we go to airports
or any even in healthcare, we wanna

87
00:04:45,989 --> 00:04:49,889
find out that or manner, in order
to do that we really heavily rely

88
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,419
on the machine learning algorithms.

89
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:55,484
So what quantum computing can
do it, it can scan the multiple

90
00:04:55,484 --> 00:04:57,164
possibilities simultaneously.

91
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,634
And as I said, it can actually, rule
out all the things which doesn't

92
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,354
make sense, and then try to get into
the solution directly so it can find

93
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:08,374
out those outliers and r events much
quicker than the classical computers.

94
00:05:08,884 --> 00:05:13,174
And it can really help in cybersecurity
also, like in, for example, in Cambridge

95
00:05:13,174 --> 00:05:16,804
Quantum, they have developed a highly
and enhanced anomaly detection.

96
00:05:16,804 --> 00:05:17,884
So they have a tool.

97
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:21,539
To spot unusual patterns in
the traffics network traffic.

98
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:25,439
So anything that happens in large scale
iot, they're able to quickly identify

99
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:29,489
what is the anomaly of out there in
the network, if there is any fraud

100
00:05:29,489 --> 00:05:31,109
happening or anything of that sort.

101
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:36,069
It, the quantum computing algorithms are
much, much powerful in detecting those.

102
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:40,059
So this can help in the iot
space when the network is much

103
00:05:40,059 --> 00:05:41,449
more complex and continuated.

104
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:43,899
So next comes the recommendation system.

105
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:48,199
Actually, quantum inspired recommendation
systems have been proved to be better

106
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:50,974
than the usual a recommendation system.

107
00:05:50,974 --> 00:05:53,704
So you can see Netflix and
Amazons are actually doing some

108
00:05:53,704 --> 00:05:58,794
research to explore the quantum
based collaborative methods par.

109
00:05:58,794 --> 00:06:01,974
It can filter out like the
preferences of the user and then

110
00:06:01,974 --> 00:06:03,714
try to make a better recommendation.

111
00:06:04,214 --> 00:06:07,604
Another very important thing in the
security space is the fraud detection.

112
00:06:07,604 --> 00:06:12,284
So we know every transaction is, must
be very secure in the case of iot space.

113
00:06:12,614 --> 00:06:17,534
So there is a quantum mono method
which actually provides more accurate

114
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:22,894
simulations, so it can find out if there
is any slight in prediction of any fraud

115
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:27,394
happening that it can actually detect
very quickly and it can actually find out.

116
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,234
If if the model if the fraud has
happened and it can quickly also notify.

117
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:36,075
So Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are
actually investing in the quantum

118
00:06:36,075 --> 00:06:40,125
computing because this is gonna make
a big difference in, in the future.

119
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,395
So next is the bioinformatics.

120
00:06:42,495 --> 00:06:46,635
Bioinformatics is like in the genome
space, which is basically finding

121
00:06:46,635 --> 00:06:51,885
out like how our DNAs and everything
basically studying in more depth of it.

122
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,820
So quantum computing is actually used
in the gen genomics sequence alignment.

123
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:01,279
So you can see these different
computations are actually happening,

124
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,739
which is very complex and heavy and to
understand and study the DNA sequencing.

125
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:06,640
So this.

126
00:07:06,935 --> 00:07:09,215
Is a space where quantum
computing can really help.

127
00:07:09,575 --> 00:07:12,965
And actually, D wave F system has actually
collaborated with the healthcare startups.

128
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:17,725
So they are doing this DNA analysis
workflows which can actually use the

129
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:20,035
quantum computing algorithms for that.

130
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:24,685
So next comes the main one, which
is the quantum machine learning.

131
00:07:25,165 --> 00:07:27,895
So in the compute space, in the
intelligence space, the machine

132
00:07:27,895 --> 00:07:31,725
learning is the biggest break
deal breaker in the coming future.

133
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:37,100
Because what happens, iot faces a lot of
problem with the respect to inferencing

134
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:42,320
in the edge because we always rely on the
cloud for inferencing for post-processing.

135
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,860
But now the way the world is
changing more towards edge, but we

136
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:51,699
also want a very backend powerful
way of inferencing at the cloud or

137
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:54,080
somewhere in the out outsource space.

138
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:57,020
So that is a place where
quantum computing can help.

139
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,400
Iot, as I mentioned, it can generate
lot of data, high intensity, high

140
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,569
high velocity data, and they're
very noisy and unstructured.

141
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:09,079
So these limited power and energy
at the edge can actually leverage

142
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:13,369
the compute quantum computing at the
backend so they can increase the need.

143
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:14,059
So basically.

144
00:08:14,675 --> 00:08:17,555
Real time decisions can be made
if the inferencing is very fast in

145
00:08:17,555 --> 00:08:21,534
quantum computing, and that can be,
offloaded to the quantum computer.

146
00:08:21,864 --> 00:08:25,254
And this machine learning
just makes the whole process

147
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,634
from start to end much easier.

148
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:34,585
So the next part I want to talk about is
how it helps in the world of security.

149
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,484
Also I wanted to talk about.

150
00:08:37,094 --> 00:08:38,954
How the inferencing happens in the edge.

151
00:08:39,194 --> 00:08:43,594
So when we can also leverage
the help of training because

152
00:08:43,594 --> 00:08:44,704
not just inferencing, right?

153
00:08:44,764 --> 00:08:47,314
Inferencing happens in the edge,
but in the case of training

154
00:08:47,314 --> 00:08:51,244
those models, large data sets, we
need the quantum support vector

155
00:08:51,274 --> 00:08:53,284
machines, well as kernel estimation.

156
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:57,364
So these are models from the quantum
computing machine learning models.

157
00:08:57,634 --> 00:09:00,604
They can actually improve
the predictor maintenance.

158
00:09:00,604 --> 00:09:02,254
They can put, they can even like.

159
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:07,274
Predict before anything happens in a much
faster, in a much advanced, and also in

160
00:09:07,274 --> 00:09:12,194
a very less time that it can actually be
very, really helpful for the predictor

161
00:09:12,194 --> 00:09:16,164
maintenance and ma manufacturing and
factories and every other field which

162
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:18,394
needs which needs predictor maintenance.

163
00:09:18,904 --> 00:09:21,484
And also it can handle high
dimensional sensor data.

164
00:09:21,484 --> 00:09:24,604
Because right now sensors are
usually are zeros and ones, right?

165
00:09:24,604 --> 00:09:24,994
So there is.

166
00:09:25,504 --> 00:09:28,414
Some concept called a quantum
sensors, which can actually

167
00:09:28,414 --> 00:09:29,974
do multiple sensor fusion.

168
00:09:30,214 --> 00:09:34,594
So these kind of multi, multiple fusion
sensors can be used in smart cities

169
00:09:34,594 --> 00:09:39,364
and smart agriculture, especially also
in the ag autonomous vehicle world.

170
00:09:39,884 --> 00:09:44,004
So as I mentioned, backend influencing is
the very key process of machine learning

171
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:45,834
with the help of quantum computing.

172
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:48,594
So when we have a model
which is optimized for.

173
00:09:48,894 --> 00:09:53,124
Quantum world and then in the inferencing
becomes much easier and much, much faster.

174
00:09:53,124 --> 00:09:57,024
And this can really help
the whole internet of things

175
00:09:57,024 --> 00:09:59,044
space using quantum computing.

176
00:09:59,614 --> 00:10:01,774
So next is the security.

177
00:10:01,774 --> 00:10:06,094
So we have touched based on how
quantum computing can really help

178
00:10:06,094 --> 00:10:08,164
and break the intelligence space.

179
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:13,319
But the security is another side of the
coin, which is amazing because as you

180
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:18,969
see today's classical world, we actually
have RSAs encryption algorithms, which

181
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:22,869
cannot be broken today because the
classical computers are beyond that.

182
00:10:23,229 --> 00:10:24,579
The keys are very long.

183
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:25,749
It's enough to break.

184
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,489
It is very hard to break them.

185
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:32,795
But in the world of con quantum
computing, RSAs, all this complex

186
00:10:32,795 --> 00:10:37,655
security algorithms can be easily broken
because they are very good and highly

187
00:10:38,255 --> 00:10:42,344
ly ruling out all the possibilities
and trying to get into the crux of it.

188
00:10:42,344 --> 00:10:46,005
So the security becomes weaker as in
the introductions of quantum computing,

189
00:10:46,364 --> 00:10:50,704
but also when it comes, it also comes
with an advantage that you can leverage

190
00:10:50,704 --> 00:10:54,364
some of the principles of quantum
computing and en enhance security.

191
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:59,519
So in IOD space, the security is such a
big problem because in initially it was

192
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,800
not designed for our security in mind.

193
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,159
So the critical vulner liberties
that we have today, it can be

194
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:07,270
solved using quantum computing.

195
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,930
So there are four techniques that are
followed, which is defense against

196
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,620
quantum attacks, quantum key distribution,
as well as quantum random generator,

197
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,150
as well as identity management.

198
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,099
We'll look into all these four right now.

199
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:19,889
So the first one is the.

200
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:21,235
Quantum attacks, right?

201
00:11:21,235 --> 00:11:26,755
So what happens, as I mentioned the RSA
is E-E-S-A-E-S is the most used algorithm.

202
00:11:26,755 --> 00:11:29,695
So these are very vulnerable
to source algorithm.

203
00:11:29,935 --> 00:11:34,475
If we have a quantum computer that
can uses algorithm and because it

204
00:11:34,475 --> 00:11:39,165
can easily break the, it can find the
keys that were used to encrypt while

205
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,505
doing a ES and R sale encryptions.

206
00:11:41,895 --> 00:11:46,920
So what happens is when we have a
quantum, when we have a. When we have

207
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,130
a very powerful algorithm coming up,
we have a quantum safe protocol that

208
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,380
can future proof the iot ecosystems.

209
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,720
Especially with these long, long
life cycles like vehicles and medical

210
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,410
and implants and satellites, they
can foolproof the whole entire

211
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,490
space when we use quantum computing
because it strengthens entire

212
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,050
strengthens is much better than
RSC and EECC that we have today.

213
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,930
So the next one is
quantum key distribution.

214
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,920
So right now we have the public and
public key and private key, a combination,

215
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,470
which will be used to set in one
place and authenticate another place.

216
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,710
But in the case of quantum queue key dev
distribution, we have this method, which

217
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:29,700
is a much secure communication which
uses the principle of quantum mechanics.

218
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,080
So the way it uses a quantum mechanism
is like to make it much more powerful the

219
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,450
way we exchange keys, the encryption keys.

220
00:12:37,005 --> 00:12:40,855
This way, the keys are much more
secure and it's very, it takes very,

221
00:12:41,005 --> 00:12:44,965
even more powerful to put a powerful
tool of condom computing to break it.

222
00:12:45,505 --> 00:12:49,255
Also as gu, it also guarantees
detection of any eavesdropping.

223
00:12:49,255 --> 00:12:52,135
If there is any facing that happens,
it can immediately detect and

224
00:12:52,135 --> 00:12:56,165
also figure out like where it has
happened and notify it very quickly.

225
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,075
It also enables unbreakable key exchange.

226
00:12:59,075 --> 00:13:02,615
So whenever we have IOT devices
from the cloud center and

227
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,725
as well as the edge devices.

228
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,700
So it enables that exchange
to be much more secure.

229
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,000
So for example, the secure key
exchange between the autonomous

230
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,500
vehicle and the roadside units, right?

231
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,700
So these things can be tightly coupled
when we use quantum key distributions.

232
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,260
So the next concept of security is
quantum random key generated, which

233
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,550
uses quantum phenomena to generate
truly random numbers because as we

234
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,970
agree today, if you use a ran function,
it actually generates some random

235
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,530
numbers, but they're not truly random.

236
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,950
But in order to get a truly random
numbers, you can use a quantum method.

237
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,550
So it enhances the encryption key
strength as well as, it can authenticate

238
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:43,860
it much better by using a very
stronger key example is you can use

239
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,190
ORNG for secure session initiation
for industrial sensors because

240
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,960
industrial sensors are, as I mentioned.

241
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:52,365
They need to first start
the nodes and then start

242
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,405
communicating the channel, right?

243
00:13:54,645 --> 00:13:58,335
So once we, once they start with the
proper random generator, they can

244
00:13:58,335 --> 00:14:00,105
actually secure it from the start itself.

245
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:04,655
So the last but not least is
tamper proof identity management.

246
00:14:04,655 --> 00:14:09,280
So we have signatures today that we sign
and send so that it creates that kind of

247
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,160
an extra level of encryption and security.

248
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,310
But in the case of quantum enhanced
authentication method, we have

249
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,170
something called quantum signatures.

250
00:14:17,545 --> 00:14:21,975
So these signatures are they ensure
that devices are verified correctly,

251
00:14:21,975 --> 00:14:23,115
and they're not like spoofed.

252
00:14:23,505 --> 00:14:25,155
And also the communication is traceable.

253
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:29,205
So anything, anywhere, any chain
breaks, it can easily detect it.

254
00:14:29,565 --> 00:14:33,475
For example, in critical
infrastructures, only the authenticated

255
00:14:33,475 --> 00:14:37,475
and quantum sign devices can
actually, send actuated signals.

256
00:14:37,775 --> 00:14:40,115
So basically it can open the
wall and shut down a tower.

257
00:14:40,115 --> 00:14:41,915
And so all these critical
things can be done.

258
00:14:42,245 --> 00:14:46,085
So in this way, you're maintaining
the identity management much better.

259
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:50,035
So these are all the techniques
that we saw in the space of quantum

260
00:14:50,035 --> 00:14:53,405
computing as well as quantum quantum
computing is doing the space of

261
00:14:53,405 --> 00:14:55,205
intelligence as well as in security.

262
00:14:55,385 --> 00:14:58,755
So hope you learn something
new and if any questions, feel

263
00:14:58,755 --> 00:15:00,480
free to reach out in LinkedIn.

264
00:15:00,855 --> 00:15:01,400
Thank you so much.
