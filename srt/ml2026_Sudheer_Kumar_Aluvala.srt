1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,989
Speaker 32: good morning everyone.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,030
I am Kumar Alala.

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,309
It's happy to be part of con 42
Machine Learning 2026 conference.

4
00:00:08,649 --> 00:00:13,649
Today we are going to explore a critical
evolution in the world of cybersecurity.

5
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:18,259
The topic which I chose is a
machine learning driven complaints

6
00:00:18,259 --> 00:00:19,904
engines for zero trust, security.

7
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,379
As we navigate the complex
landscape of 2026 and the sheer

8
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:29,690
volume of the data and the speed of
modern attacks have fundamentally

9
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,930
outpaced human managed security.

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,170
We are here to discuss a paradigm
shift which is transforming static

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,970
policy enforcement into an inclusion
adaptive security controls.

12
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:44,455
This isn't just an automation.

13
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:49,585
It is about building a defense
system that thinks, learns and

14
00:00:49,585 --> 00:00:55,065
reacts autonomously at the same
velocity as the adversaries we face.

15
00:00:55,735 --> 00:01:00,995
Before getting into the topic more I would
like to have a quick intro of myself.

16
00:01:01,305 --> 00:01:05,120
Currently I'm working as a
client delivery director at heel.

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,450
America and do with this role we
are primarily providing ZT and a

18
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:16,680
frameworks and the aid driven compliance
solutions for multiple enterprises.

19
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,730
And also SMB customers few of them are
part of fortune five organizations.

20
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:28,150
The insights, which I'm sharing today are,
primarily coming from the challenges which

21
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:32,850
we faced while implementing our solutions
in high stakes environments where

22
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,195
static is synonymous with vulnerable.

23
00:01:35,714 --> 00:01:37,705
Let's get into the topic itself.

24
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:44,915
The while we are trying to implement
these solutions primarily it's a gap of,

25
00:01:44,965 --> 00:01:47,575
the compliance gap in zero Trust itself.

26
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:53,115
While many organizations have implemented
a Zero Trust network security protocols

27
00:01:53,115 --> 00:01:59,679
and access they're still tethering this
modern architecture to a legacy mindset.

28
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:05,249
Currently many of these organizations are
rely on static manually defined policies.

29
00:02:06,134 --> 00:02:11,284
Now that simply cannot keep the pace with
the rapid evolution of modern threats.

30
00:02:11,684 --> 00:02:16,894
These traditional rule-based controls
struggle to adapt a new attack

31
00:02:16,894 --> 00:02:22,624
patterns and fail to scale across
hybrid and multi-cloud environments

32
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:24,939
that define our businesses today.

33
00:02:25,309 --> 00:02:29,349
Let's deep dive into why the
status quo is failing us.

34
00:02:30,134 --> 00:02:36,204
Because many of the organizations have
defined their policy enhancements or

35
00:02:36,204 --> 00:02:39,264
upgrades or updates is very periodical.

36
00:02:39,764 --> 00:02:45,064
This traditional policy refresh
on fixed schedules often leaving

37
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:48,084
security gaps between update cycles.

38
00:02:48,414 --> 00:02:50,454
While threats evolve continuously.

39
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:55,669
And the second thing what I found is
the manual configuration risk itself,

40
00:02:56,119 --> 00:03:02,469
the human defined rules are primarily
it's pro to misconfigurations or

41
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:08,589
inconsistencies and simple errors that
create exploitable vulnerabilities.

42
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:13,129
The third one, which we've seen
is that scalability barriers.

43
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:19,144
As digital footprint is kept on expanding
maintaining thousands of individual

44
00:03:19,144 --> 00:03:23,684
rules whether it's individuals or
whether it's for groups within the

45
00:03:23,684 --> 00:03:30,334
organizations are fragmented systems are
becoming operationally unsustainable.

46
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:35,074
So these are the three key
pillars in terms of the issues

47
00:03:35,134 --> 00:03:38,409
which we can categorize while
implementing these solutions.

48
00:03:39,264 --> 00:03:40,224
Let's move on.

49
00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:44,204
What exactly the solution which we
are looking currently our solution

50
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:49,494
is a transition to and a machine
learning driven compliance framework.

51
00:03:49,694 --> 00:03:54,444
We are moving away from very
rigid rule-based logic and two

52
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:56,454
words and intelligent models.

53
00:03:56,934 --> 00:04:02,654
So these models are capable of learning
adapting and enforcing complaints.

54
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:06,379
In real time directly with ZTNA ecosystem.

55
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:11,329
We are essentially replacing the
manual bottleneck with an intelligent

56
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:13,169
and a self garnering engine.

57
00:04:13,649 --> 00:04:18,709
So if you see the architectural
overview so it's a closed loop design.

58
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:22,809
It functions across four
critical repeating stages.

59
00:04:23,299 --> 00:04:26,449
One is the the first step
is the data ingestion.

60
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:32,079
This is the sensory layer gathering the
telemetry from across the enterprise.

61
00:04:32,369 --> 00:04:36,914
And the second area is second
pillar is the model training where

62
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:42,009
the engine turns the raw data
into an actionable intelligence.

63
00:04:42,754 --> 00:04:47,549
The third one is predictive
enforcement based on the data

64
00:04:47,549 --> 00:04:51,679
which got through the ingestion
layer and the model training layer.

65
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:56,839
This is a a proactive layer
which makes an access decisions

66
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,399
based on the projected risk.

67
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,739
The fourth one is the automated feedback.

68
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:06,709
This primarily ensures the system
learns every outcome and create

69
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:09,299
a self-optimizing control layer.

70
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:13,429
So with these four layers where
we are currently looking at

71
00:05:13,429 --> 00:05:19,169
predictive enforcement and automated
feedback we can ensure we we can

72
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:21,324
avoid the delays and then secure.

73
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:22,849
The organizations.

74
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:28,209
So if you see the source of powering
these decisions are primarily if

75
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:33,449
you see that the engine pulls the
data from three primary pillars.

76
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:38,979
One is endpoint telemetry which provides
the real time data on the device health

77
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:41,779
configuration states and the patch levels.

78
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,879
And the second is the user
behavioral analysis itself.

79
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:52,464
From which we can analyze and access
the pattern and authentication history

80
00:05:52,614 --> 00:05:57,974
to generate the contextual risk
force, risk score for the individuals.

81
00:05:58,314 --> 00:06:02,454
The third one is the cloud native
threat intel where we integrate

82
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:07,184
global threat feeds and industry
specific vulnerability intelligence.

83
00:06:07,644 --> 00:06:11,054
Data to stay ahead of
emerging attack vectors.

84
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:15,524
While we are by synthesizing
these data points, we enable a

85
00:06:15,524 --> 00:06:17,444
dynamic risk assessment model.

86
00:06:17,674 --> 00:06:20,464
We no longer rely on snapshots in time.

87
00:06:20,744 --> 00:06:24,394
The system evaluates risk-based
on current conditions.

88
00:06:24,674 --> 00:06:28,434
If threat indicators change
access decisions are just.

89
00:06:28,894 --> 00:06:29,914
On real time.

90
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:34,644
And furthermore, predictive analytics
allow us to identify potential

91
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:40,234
complaints violations before they
occur moving us from reactive defense

92
00:06:40,264 --> 00:06:42,704
to a proactive posture management.

93
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:48,959
So while deploying these production
solution, these ML based solutions what

94
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:54,479
we found is, there is an achievement
of 40% faster incident response through

95
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,199
automated enforcements and also 98
percentage of reduction in critical policy

96
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:03,009
errors through ML generated controls.

97
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:08,119
And and there is an a 60% decrease in
manual effort allowing team to pivot

98
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:13,009
into the new strategic initiatives
rather spending on mundane daily tasks.

99
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:18,239
So the continuous learning feedback
loop this is primarily the brain

100
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:22,209
of the system is the self-improving
int intelligence itself.

101
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,829
Every enforcement decision
becomes a training data.

102
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:31,529
The system learns from both successful
interventions and false positives

103
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,939
continuously refining its accuracy.

104
00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:38,089
This closed loop approach
ensures the framework evolves.

105
00:07:38,494 --> 00:07:41,804
Alongside the environment
and emerging threats.

106
00:07:42,304 --> 00:07:45,804
Next is the enterprise
considerations for this framework.

107
00:07:45,854 --> 00:07:50,124
Likely to be succeed it must have
explainability and governance.

108
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:55,164
Enterprise adoption requires trust,
so we provide a clear decision,

109
00:07:55,164 --> 00:07:57,454
rational and complete audit trails.

110
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,680
This ensures that even though even
though the engine is automated

111
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:08,270
it remains transparent and meets
all regulatory requirements the

112
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,945
security must be also be ethical.

113
00:08:11,195 --> 00:08:18,005
The bias detection and mitigation should
be avoided because it ensures the access

114
00:08:18,005 --> 00:08:20,715
decisions remain non-discriminatory.

115
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:26,890
A human oversight which is required
sometimes security teams, we should have

116
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:33,740
a supervisory control with the ability to
review and override the decisions privacy

117
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:39,170
and preserving the analytics, which
are primarily respecting user privacy.

118
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:44,095
Through anonymization and the purpose
Limited only to the data processing

119
00:08:44,595 --> 00:08:46,665
deployment, flex flexibility.

120
00:08:46,715 --> 00:08:50,595
What we have done is we
have designed this for SMEs.

121
00:08:50,885 --> 00:08:56,875
We have considered as a lightweight
deployment with managed ML services for

122
00:08:56,875 --> 00:09:00,305
rapid time to value for large enterprises.

123
00:09:00,845 --> 00:09:04,835
Primarily we support hybrid
deployments and integration with

124
00:09:04,865 --> 00:09:07,535
existing SIEM and so platforms.

125
00:09:07,585 --> 00:09:08,155
As well.

126
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:14,730
The future of the z zero trust
compliance is in conclusion, what

127
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,140
I would like to say is machine
learning transforms complaints from.

128
00:09:19,705 --> 00:09:24,975
A static checkpoint into an intelligent
self-learning control layer.

129
00:09:25,195 --> 00:09:29,535
This represents the vital shift
from reactive policy enforcement to

130
00:09:29,815 --> 00:09:32,295
proactive intelligence driven security.

131
00:09:32,795 --> 00:09:34,650
Thank you thank you for your time.

132
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,110
My name is Kumar Ala, and it's been.

133
00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:44,055
Privilege to share this vision at
conf 2042 machine learning 2026.

134
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:45,205
Thanks everyone.

135
00:09:45,705 --> 00:09:45,995
Okay.
