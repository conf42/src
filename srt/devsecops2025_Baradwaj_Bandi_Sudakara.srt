1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,240
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:02,980
Thank you so much for joining today.

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,170
My name is Bar Ndira.

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,510
I'm a senior software engineer at
Ascension Health, and today I'm excited to

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:16,660
talk about how AI and generative machine
learning are transforming DevSecOps into

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,825
foster, smarter and more secure discip.

7
00:00:20,325 --> 00:00:25,155
In the organization I have worked with,
we have seen firsthand how traditional QA

8
00:00:26,055 --> 00:00:30,555
and security practices struggles to keep
up with the modern delivery velocity.

9
00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:34,185
So this session is focused on one idea.

10
00:00:34,725 --> 00:00:39,975
How do we evolve devs SecOps
into an intelligent, productive,

11
00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:42,075
autonomous system through ai?

12
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:43,355
Let's dive in.

13
00:00:43,855 --> 00:00:47,605
The challenge by traditional
dev SecOps is falling behind.

14
00:00:48,385 --> 00:00:52,855
Today's software delivery environment
is fundamentally different from

15
00:00:52,915 --> 00:00:55,135
DevSecOps was originally built for.

16
00:00:55,635 --> 00:01:00,885
We are dealing with extremely
high deployment velocity, daily

17
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:02,205
and continuous deployments.

18
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:08,415
Microservices are distributed cloud native
architectures, right, dynamic attack

19
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:10,935
surfaces, and unpredictable interactions.

20
00:01:11,435 --> 00:01:15,994
But our QA cycles, security
reviews, unscripted automation

21
00:01:16,054 --> 00:01:17,884
are still largely static.

22
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:23,015
The result, a widening gap between
deployment, speed and assurance.

23
00:01:23,735 --> 00:01:29,045
Traditional pipelines simply cannot
safeguards today's complexity because

24
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:35,524
they rely on rigid tests and predefined
security rules while real world systems

25
00:01:35,524 --> 00:01:38,434
behaves in fluid, unpredictable ways.

26
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:41,270
This is why we need significant evolution.

27
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,270
Evolution required for reactive
to intelligent DevSecOps.

28
00:01:46,575 --> 00:01:53,545
DevSecOps has to move from reactive to
predictive manual to automated static

29
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:56,025
context error, gatekeeping acceleration.

30
00:01:56,535 --> 00:01:59,535
We are no longer talk, talking
about adding more checks.

31
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:03,375
We are talk, talking about
self-learning systems.

32
00:02:03,885 --> 00:02:07,635
That enhance QA and
security automatically.

33
00:02:08,134 --> 00:02:09,214
So think about like this.

34
00:02:09,304 --> 00:02:13,445
AI becomes the engine that drive
this transformation, right?

35
00:02:13,505 --> 00:02:17,195
AI is going to be feature that's
going to drive this transformation.

36
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:18,725
Let's move on to this next slide.

37
00:02:19,445 --> 00:02:24,605
Generate you AI accelerating test
and security script creation.

38
00:02:25,105 --> 00:02:26,424
One of the biggest.

39
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:32,289
Breakthrough is generative AI for
tests and security automation.

40
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:39,495
AI tools like copilot can do everything
right, but I just shot it into a

41
00:02:39,495 --> 00:02:44,445
little bit of what are I am seeing
it day to day read usage storage.

42
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,529
It was able to re it stories,
understand code context,

43
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,719
generate complete test suits.

44
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,339
Create security validation
scripts built end-to-end scenarios

45
00:02:55,429 --> 00:02:57,109
aligned with real business logic.

46
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,359
These are automated these are excellent.

47
00:02:59,749 --> 00:03:01,429
So read user stories.

48
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:05,429
It was able to read the user
stories and add stories to our

49
00:03:05,429 --> 00:03:06,774
Jira as well using cps, right?

50
00:03:06,824 --> 00:03:07,554
JIRA plugins.

51
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:11,054
So these are all something which
GitHub copilot can do right now.

52
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:15,824
This drastically reduces manual
scripting efforts and ensures.

53
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:19,394
Coverages of scenarios
humans often overlook.

54
00:03:19,894 --> 00:03:24,844
In short, yay becomes your
automation engineer working 24 7.

55
00:03:25,344 --> 00:03:30,684
Moving on to next slide, machine
learning, predictive quality engineering.

56
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:34,015
This is an interesting topic,
which we are like using.

57
00:03:34,204 --> 00:03:37,144
Most of the companies started
using day-to-day, so machine

58
00:03:37,144 --> 00:03:41,674
learning takes this step further by
making your pipeline intelligent.

59
00:03:42,174 --> 00:03:45,414
Machine learning models can
analyze it, analyze production

60
00:03:45,414 --> 00:03:47,484
logs, historical defects.

61
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:48,684
What else?

62
00:03:48,684 --> 00:03:49,584
Code changes.

63
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:54,444
Any threats, intelligence system,
behavior patterns, and then they can

64
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:56,779
make predictions, which models are risky.

65
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:58,829
Why is that risky?

66
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,929
Which tests should run fast?

67
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:02,969
Why is it running fast, slow now?

68
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,219
Which areas are likely to break?

69
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:10,049
What is the, what are the chances that
data can break in future code changes

70
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,934
where new vulnerabilities might emerge?

71
00:04:13,314 --> 00:04:14,374
That's again, key, right?

72
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:20,125
We are all into security where I'm seeing
like the security testing is rapidly going

73
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:25,675
fast and machine learning can, using,
use that this create risk-based testing

74
00:04:25,735 --> 00:04:28,315
strategy that reduces execution time.

75
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:30,655
While improving the
accuracy, that's the key.

76
00:04:31,155 --> 00:04:34,005
QA is more crucial for accuracy.

77
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:38,865
So here we are increasing the execution
time and increasing the speed of the

78
00:04:38,865 --> 00:04:41,414
testing and while improving accuracy.

79
00:04:41,835 --> 00:04:45,675
Think of this as your pipeline,
learning from every release and

80
00:04:45,675 --> 00:04:48,905
getting smarter over time, that's
like excellent feature, right?

81
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:53,255
Machine learning was able to help us,
that our pipeline itself learning,

82
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:54,755
okay, these are the things going on.

83
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:56,615
Okay, this needs to be improved.

84
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:02,015
If you receive a email with all
the issues, what are the things we

85
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:06,635
changed from the previous things
that's going to make a real impact.

86
00:05:06,685 --> 00:05:07,525
Let's move on to.

87
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,195
The key thing, the real world impact.

88
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:15,195
When teams adopt a driven
SecOps, the impact is dramatic.

89
00:05:15,695 --> 00:05:19,775
Major reduction in text
test, execution time, foster

90
00:05:19,835 --> 00:05:23,825
identification of vulnerabilities,
huge drop in manual scripting.

91
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,730
Better coverage of edge cases is
early detection of system anon.

92
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,760
You in this way, what will happen,
what is the real world impact here?

93
00:05:33,549 --> 00:05:37,260
You deliver faster, safer,
and with higher confidence.

94
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:38,760
That's the key.

95
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:41,610
We need to be confident when
we are delivering something.

96
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,270
Let's move on to a case study here.

97
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,585
A driven test data generation.

98
00:05:46,085 --> 00:05:51,215
Let me share a real world example
in microservices environment.

99
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:57,770
Generating realistic, interconnected test
data is extremely dissolve difficult.

100
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,150
Yay.

101
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,885
Solve this by how can yay help us?

102
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,925
Yay, can solve this by understanding the
schemas, what kind of schemas we have.

103
00:06:06,425 --> 00:06:10,265
Analyze the production data patterns,
what kind of data we are getting

104
00:06:10,265 --> 00:06:14,555
in production, what kind of data we
should use to recreate these issues,

105
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:19,475
or what kind of data if we use, we can
eliminate some of these issues to do.

106
00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:24,955
That's something we can use the AI
for Synthesize realistic data sets.

107
00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:28,045
That bunch of data sets can be there.

108
00:06:28,105 --> 00:06:31,290
It can help us to synthesize
the realistic data sets.

109
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,060
Auto generating boundary
and edge case data.

110
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,920
So that's something
which is always tricky.

111
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,630
There are multiple edge
cases can be there.

112
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,520
We can use here.

113
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,840
Help to understand some of the
edge cases, the outcome of this

114
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,630
case study, test data generation.

115
00:06:50,455 --> 00:06:56,275
Test data preparation time drops massively
while coverage significantly increases.

116
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:57,175
That's the key.

117
00:06:57,925 --> 00:07:01,795
Dramatically reduces the test data
preparation time with significantly

118
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:06,175
improved coverage across service
boundaries and data sets.

119
00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:07,485
That's key.

120
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:14,440
Let's move on to another case study where
machine learning based anomaly detection.

121
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,420
Another powerful use case
is anomaly detection.

122
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:25,620
Machine learning can learn what
normal looks like across distributor

123
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,770
services, and then monitor for
deviation in the real time.

124
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,400
That's very key, right?

125
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,975
Performance drifts, suspicious
access patterns, latency spikes.

126
00:07:37,885 --> 00:07:39,385
Unusual resource conception.

127
00:07:39,715 --> 00:07:43,395
This are something where which we
can use the machine learning set.

128
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:50,295
When ano an anomaly occur, the system
can trigger automated workflows, alert,

129
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:52,725
security systems, or even mitigate.

130
00:07:53,355 --> 00:07:57,105
We stage attacks where in my case,
we are triggering a Slack alert.

131
00:07:57,475 --> 00:08:02,125
Hey, there is some kind of spy
thing, suspicious pattern going on,

132
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,475
which is not happening day to day.

133
00:08:03,895 --> 00:08:07,135
We can, we are seeing like there
is a slowness when a user try to

134
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:11,425
submit a prob, this is taking this
long, this was not the case in past.

135
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:16,270
So un importantly, unusual unusual
resource conception like memories.

136
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,045
It, we can also see memory
conception might be too high.

137
00:08:20,405 --> 00:08:22,140
This was never happened in the past.

138
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,040
We can request, we can.

139
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,510
We will receive a Slack notification.

140
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,870
If it's way bad, we will
also receive a call.

141
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:34,440
This brings us closer to
autonomous operation in pipeline.

142
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,330
Okay, let's move on to next slide.

143
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,920
Integration strategy.

144
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,290
How to bring a into your pipeline.

145
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,010
You don't need to rebuild your digs.

146
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,420
DevSecOps pipeline.

147
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,640
Your adaption happens in phases.

148
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,500
Phase one, assess and pilot.

149
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:51,700
Start small.

150
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,280
It's always important.

151
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,390
Don't rush into the things.

152
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,170
Start small.

153
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,870
Usually with AI based generation
and vulnerabilities planning, that's

154
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,015
where you, you should start phase two.

155
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,140
Integrate and train.

156
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,580
Connect AI tools into your ci cd pipeline.

157
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,170
Train machine learning models
using historical locks.

158
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,240
Incidents.

159
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,940
How the, how, what are
the errors were happening?

160
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,400
Give enough access to the
machine learning models.

161
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,110
What are the things it should rate?

162
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,010
Okay, on phase three, the key
thing, skull and optimize.

163
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,010
Expand to more service.

164
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,350
Refine your models with feedback loop.

165
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,320
The model service, you gi give the machine
learning models, it can get more data

166
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,150
and understand how the system works here.

167
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,230
And phase four is again
another important one.

168
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,030
Autonomous operation enable
AI to make real time decisions

169
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:51,090
such as test prioritization
and automated security export.

170
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,590
So those are some key things.

171
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,995
Okay, to move on to next slide.

172
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,175
No complete overhaul required.

173
00:09:57,565 --> 00:09:58,555
This is important.

174
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:00,385
Yay augments.

175
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:05,125
It does not, doesn't replace
your existing framework space.

176
00:10:05,995 --> 00:10:07,105
It would, it won't.

177
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:09,955
It's not going to change your
existing automation framework.

178
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:12,905
It's just going to improve it.

179
00:10:13,495 --> 00:10:13,765
Okay.

180
00:10:13,765 --> 00:10:16,975
That's the key thing again how
efficient it's going to be,

181
00:10:17,455 --> 00:10:19,545
how important it's going to be.

182
00:10:19,605 --> 00:10:20,415
That's the key thing.

183
00:10:20,915 --> 00:10:24,395
Your security policy, stay your
security policy means your company

184
00:10:24,395 --> 00:10:25,985
security policies is going to stay.

185
00:10:26,435 --> 00:10:27,365
That's again, a key thing.

186
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:27,760
Okay?

187
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,400
Alright, next one.

188
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,020
Your CACD pipeline stay.

189
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,590
Your CACD pipeline is going
to not going to change.

190
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,520
It's going to still stay
same as it was before.

191
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,500
Focus.

192
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:39,800
Yay.

193
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,700
On the areas where manual
efforts is highest and risk

194
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,620
is greatest for maximum R way.

195
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,480
Yay.

196
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,230
Simply takes over the most
repetitive, complex and high risk

197
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,620
tasks to boost speed and quality.

198
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,360
Let's move on to this
next slide number 10.

199
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,780
Risk-based testing Focus, vari matters.

200
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,400
Yay enables intelligent
prioritization there.

201
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,640
In my opinion, it's a pyramid.

202
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,850
There are five important things,
which A, is AI prioritize.

203
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,270
Okay.

204
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:16,540
Critical parts, high risk models
recently change code, change

205
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:23,100
components in integration boundaries,
low risk, stable code, and I like

206
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,020
to tell a stable low risk areas.

207
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,630
This cuts execution time and
improves precision by validating.

208
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:35,200
What truly impacts business critical
functionality, so that's important, right?

209
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,450
Validating the what truly impacts
our business Critical functionality.

210
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,770
MI models analyze the code, changes
historical defect rates, and

211
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,680
business impact to automatically
prioritize testing effort.

212
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:52,520
This intelligent allocation ensures
critical functionality issues maximum

213
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:57,860
validation while reducing wasted
efforts on stable low risk areas.

214
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,980
Let's move on to the next slide.

215
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,900
Slide number 11, automated
vulnerability detection.

216
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,670
There are three key things,
statistic analysis, runtime

217
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,930
protection, and dependence.

218
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:09,680
Intelligence.

219
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,770
AI improves security through
context of our statistic analysis.

220
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:20,530
Also, realtime behavioral
monitoring supply chain intelligence

221
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,905
prioritized patching this
transform security from reactive

222
00:12:24,905 --> 00:12:27,385
patching to predictive protection.

223
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:32,250
And if you see dependency intelligence,
yea continuously tracks supply chain

224
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:39,130
risk, automatically prioritizing patches
based on exploitability and impact.

225
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,820
That's important.

226
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,040
Okay, let's move to next slide.

227
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,750
Benefits, speed, cost, and confidence
when YEA becomes part of DevSecOps.

228
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,800
Organization experience poster releases.

229
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:58,020
Reduce the test maintenance,
proactive security postures, lower

230
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:03,450
operational cost, higher customer
trust, resilient systems quality and

231
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,370
security no longer slows you down.

232
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,040
They become business accelerator.

233
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,875
So let's move on to the key slide.

234
00:13:10,935 --> 00:13:17,235
Actionable stake takeaways for your
team to wrap up with practical aspects.

235
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:19,515
Start with one pilot.

236
00:13:20,015 --> 00:13:24,705
Start with one pilot use case,
improve your data quality, build your

237
00:13:24,705 --> 00:13:26,795
work, build cross-functional teams.

238
00:13:27,455 --> 00:13:29,115
Create feedback loops.

239
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:30,155
That's again important.

240
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:36,795
Create mechanisms for models to learn
from production incidents and fall and

241
00:13:37,585 --> 00:13:40,505
continuous implement is essential focus.

242
00:13:41,005 --> 00:13:44,505
Focus on enablement, not
replacement position.

243
00:13:44,505 --> 00:13:47,715
A s an enabler, not a replacement.

244
00:13:48,705 --> 00:13:50,145
It's not going to replace anything.

245
00:13:50,145 --> 00:13:52,965
It's just going to improve
it, so it's enabler.

246
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:56,835
With these steps, you can move
towards intelligent DevSecOps

247
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:59,615
without description, conclusion.

248
00:14:00,035 --> 00:14:01,410
The next slide will be conclusion.

249
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,970
AI driven DS DevSecOps is not the future.

250
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,900
It's the present.

251
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,230
We are not going to enter
into a, we are already in ai.

252
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,950
It transforms quality and
security from bottlenecks into

253
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,020
powerful competitive advantages.

254
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,820
With the predictive defect
detection, automatic security

255
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,110
scanning, and self-learning
pipelines, teams can deliver faster.

256
00:14:25,515 --> 00:14:31,305
Safer and with the complete confidence,
the organization that adopt AI

257
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:36,735
early with lead innovation, customer
trust, and operational excellence.

258
00:14:37,235 --> 00:14:38,945
