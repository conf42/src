00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:02,070
Hi.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,030
Good morning everyone.

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,230
I'm Bala pna.

4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,360
Today I'm going to talk about how Agent
TK is transforming enterprise integration

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,340
from being reactive to resilient.

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,690
Most modern enterprises confront
significant challenges in maintaining

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,710
reliable integrations across increasingly
complex application ecosystems.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,335
As organizations adopt specialized
software solutions, the dependability

9
00:00:27,355 --> 00:00:28,575
of these interconnections.

10
00:00:28,935 --> 00:00:32,504
Directly impacts business continuity
and operational excellence.

11
00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:39,254
This presentation explores how care is
transforming the enterprise application

12
00:00:39,254 --> 00:00:43,575
integration and EDA frameworks through
site reliability engineering principles.

13
00:00:44,114 --> 00:00:49,724
The result is a self-healing, highly
observable integration systems that

14
00:00:49,724 --> 00:00:53,025
substantially improve the key reliability,
metrics, and operational performance.

15
00:00:53,685 --> 00:00:55,394
This is the key for any business success.

16
00:00:56,985 --> 00:01:01,425
Before we dive deep into the agent TKA
framework, I would like to emphasize

17
00:01:01,425 --> 00:01:06,645
the integration challenges that these
enterprises face in today's landscape.

18
00:01:07,395 --> 00:01:10,665
There are three main things that
I would like to highlight on first

19
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:15,555
scale requirements, the need to manage
growing, number of integration points.

20
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:16,605
Yes.

21
00:01:17,115 --> 00:01:19,305
every day there is a new language model.

22
00:01:19,395 --> 00:01:21,855
Every day, there are hundreds
of new apps being built.

23
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,710
And these are required for
the business to stay relevant.

24
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:31,750
And if these are integrated into the
ecosystem, then the integration team

25
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:39,580
needs to adapt itself and scale itself
to integrate with these new head systems.

26
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:45,480
Second is the system complexity,
the in intricacy of, integrating

27
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,810
complex heterogeneous and
diverse software ecosystem.

28
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:53,355
With this growing challenge of
more and more apps being built,

29
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:57,915
each enterprises has hundreds
and thousands of applications,

30
00:01:58,255 --> 00:02:00,655
interconnected for various reasons.

31
00:02:00,895 --> 00:02:06,445
So these complex ecosystem is a real
challenge for integration teams.

32
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:08,875
And third is the time sensitivity.

33
00:02:09,865 --> 00:02:14,155
Any failure in integration, and if it
is always connected to any business

34
00:02:14,155 --> 00:02:15,745
critical time, critical interfaces.

35
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,840
It is going to cause a huge
financial loss for the business.

36
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:26,234
So the business will be always be on
top to fix these integration, failures.

37
00:02:26,385 --> 00:02:31,225
So it is always time critical to
address these integration, challenges.

38
00:02:31,495 --> 00:02:34,435
So these are the three main
challenges the integration team

39
00:02:34,675 --> 00:02:36,775
faces in today's enterprises.

40
00:02:38,035 --> 00:02:41,855
This is where I would like to
propose, the agent TK framework to

41
00:02:41,855 --> 00:02:43,565
resolve these integration challenges.

42
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:50,765
Let us get into the Agent K framework,
specialist agents, collaborative

43
00:02:50,765 --> 00:02:54,635
intelligence, self-healing systems,
and continuous optimization.

44
00:02:54,995 --> 00:02:59,915
These four components weave together
to make the fabric of the agent K.

45
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:02,285
In integration specialist agents.

46
00:03:03,155 --> 00:03:07,595
We have task specific problem
specific agents, which takes care of.

47
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:12,619
Resolving a specific problem and
modeled in such a way that they

48
00:03:12,619 --> 00:03:14,950
don't, overlap with the other agents.

49
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:21,119
when you put together all these agents in
a workflow, it needs to be overseen by an

50
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:23,999
orchestrator in aa orchestrator decides.

51
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:29,069
what agents needs to be involved
in this specific workflow and

52
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:32,849
they decide and create that
workflow using a workflow agent.

53
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:37,929
And once that is done, if there are any
issues in this whole business workflow,

54
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:43,599
we just deduct it and resolve those errors
without any human intervention using the

55
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,579
self-healing system or the remediation,
plan that these orchestrator have.

56
00:03:50,004 --> 00:03:51,444
EA can Hal need.

57
00:03:51,744 --> 00:03:56,274
So we need to put a self-healing
mechanism to ensure and

58
00:03:56,274 --> 00:03:58,494
monitor and detect any issues.

59
00:03:59,244 --> 00:04:06,654
The whole business workflow, can be
optimized by learning new designs, by

60
00:04:06,654 --> 00:04:12,494
learning, the pattern and understanding,
the business workflow that is suitable

61
00:04:12,494 --> 00:04:14,654
for our business and optimized in a.

62
00:04:15,644 --> 00:04:21,794
Best possible way by adhering
to the rules and AI governance.

63
00:04:23,294 --> 00:04:28,394
Let's understand how these agent
aea, correlates with the SRE model.

64
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:34,034
This slide shows the pillars of
the site, reliability, engineering

65
00:04:34,034 --> 00:04:38,414
model, automation, service level,
objectives, incident management.

66
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:43,244
Observability capacity planning,
shared responsibility, which all

67
00:04:43,364 --> 00:04:45,074
enhance the service reliability.

68
00:04:46,184 --> 00:04:52,454
This slide resonates with the agent
TK framework where we do automation.

69
00:04:52,604 --> 00:04:56,714
We ensure that the service level
duties are measured and addressed.

70
00:04:57,104 --> 00:04:59,024
the incidents are automatically handled.

71
00:04:59,294 --> 00:05:04,334
We have an observable, highly
observable case where we monitor

72
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,064
and the capacity is planned.

73
00:05:07,424 --> 00:05:11,474
And forecasted and the
responsibilities naturally shatter.

74
00:05:12,824 --> 00:05:17,264
Let us get into the technical architecture
of the agent Dke and understand better

75
00:05:20,384 --> 00:05:22,904
let us get into the technical
architecture and framework of the

76
00:05:22,904 --> 00:05:25,124
A Agents in EEA and EDA piece.

77
00:05:25,874 --> 00:05:28,934
This diagram shows the business
flow and the agent flow.

78
00:05:29,324 --> 00:05:34,844
The business flow has, the external users
communicating to the B2B software, which

79
00:05:34,844 --> 00:05:38,654
internally transforms the data from the
external users, like trading partners,

80
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:43,914
customer suppliers, or government
agencies and banks, into the, format that

81
00:05:43,914 --> 00:05:49,424
the internal application ERP solutions
CRM solutions require, based on their

82
00:05:49,424 --> 00:05:51,014
own data architecture or the schema.

83
00:05:51,344 --> 00:05:57,614
And that is consumed by those applications
and applies the business logic to.

84
00:05:58,064 --> 00:06:02,434
Or complete the O2 C or P two P or
inventory management or any kind

85
00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:07,194
of, application level business logic
are applied and the corresponding

86
00:06:07,464 --> 00:06:11,604
acknowledgements or the invoices
or the payments or anything is

87
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:16,834
being rerouted back to the same,
partner in the current framework.

88
00:06:17,324 --> 00:06:20,864
the reports are generated from
these application layer for the

89
00:06:20,864 --> 00:06:24,444
management and stakeholders to
ensure, the forecast is good.

90
00:06:24,774 --> 00:06:28,104
the baseline of the cloud
company is doing good.

91
00:06:28,464 --> 00:06:30,294
All these are happening in today's world.

92
00:06:31,644 --> 00:06:35,754
Over and top of this business
flow, we build an agent workflow.

93
00:06:36,924 --> 00:06:41,184
The customer service agent is the
front end of this whole agent workflow,

94
00:06:41,454 --> 00:06:46,794
which can handle any queries or ments
from both internal and external users.

95
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:52,914
The customer service agent takes these
requirements, splits it into individual

96
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:56,214
task, and sends it to the AI orchestrator.

97
00:06:56,394 --> 00:07:00,944
The AI orchestrator consumes
these tasks and, refines it and

98
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:02,774
send it to the specialist agents.

99
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:07,229
And each specialization agent
completes the task by connecting to

100
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:11,669
the corresponding application layer and
ensuring the business logic is implied.

101
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:15,089
And, completing the whole
any, business processes.

102
00:07:16,109 --> 00:07:19,434
This whole, architecture is
governed by the governance layer.

103
00:07:20,109 --> 00:07:24,729
The governance layer has it,
security, data security, yay.

104
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:25,989
Governance and policies.

105
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:26,859
All those are.

106
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:30,259
based on the corresponding
market that this particular

107
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:31,969
business is delivering it to,

108
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:38,719
every data which is being recorded
in this business process is being

109
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:43,789
stored in the data lake that is
then being refined and again stored

110
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:48,709
into a training data which trains
these language models and AI agents.

111
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:55,399
This way, we complete the whole framework
and the continuous, optimization.

112
00:07:55,864 --> 00:08:02,894
continuous, an autonomy and, the, highly
efficient, integration model is being

113
00:08:02,894 --> 00:08:05,044
built using this agent, a framework.

114
00:08:06,844 --> 00:08:09,874
Let's understand its, users
and other functionalities.

115
00:08:09,874 --> 00:08:10,564
In the next slide line,

116
00:08:12,814 --> 00:08:16,294
let us understand the various
specialist agents that are.

117
00:08:16,714 --> 00:08:18,424
Defined in this process.

118
00:08:18,694 --> 00:08:21,604
There could be like several hundreds
of specialist agents that we can build.

119
00:08:22,094 --> 00:08:26,984
one is the validation agent that ensures
the data integrity and SMA schema

120
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:29,254
compliance in case of, formatted data.

121
00:08:29,524 --> 00:08:33,124
It could be an idoc, it could
be edifact, it could be e an

122
00:08:33,124 --> 00:08:35,104
CX tool or any particular.

123
00:08:35,494 --> 00:08:39,194
Format, that the particular
business use, it could be HEPA

124
00:08:39,404 --> 00:08:41,264
standard or any other standards.

125
00:08:41,504 --> 00:08:45,284
All those are insured in this
validation by this validation agent.

126
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,314
And, translation agents.

127
00:08:47,584 --> 00:08:51,814
Translation agents take care
of transforming the data from

128
00:08:51,814 --> 00:08:53,794
one format to the other format.

129
00:08:54,424 --> 00:08:56,614
The third is the monitoring
and detection agent.

130
00:08:57,064 --> 00:08:59,614
It identifies the anomalies and.

131
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:06,989
potential failures in different, cases
and ensure the Y agent doesn't hallucinate

132
00:09:07,349 --> 00:09:10,229
or any other process has any bug.

133
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:14,759
And those bugs are remediated
orchestration agents.

134
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:18,209
These are agents which takes care
of building this whole workflow

135
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:22,699
of, collaborative, structure that
multiple agents can work together.

136
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:24,349
Connector agents are.

137
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:29,459
To establish a new connection to
your new application, or a new

138
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:34,059
a system or a new, enterprise to
establish all these connections.

139
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:39,639
A connector agent can consume whatever
the requirement is, and, generate

140
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:43,649
the corresponding firewall, changes,
requests, and all those, internal

141
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:49,349
requirements that are necessary for
completing the connection security agents.

142
00:09:49,859 --> 00:09:55,909
Security agents ensure the security
of all the data security and, user

143
00:09:55,909 --> 00:10:00,849
security by ensuring, that it is
all the data is either encrypted

144
00:10:00,849 --> 00:10:02,409
or decrypted in the right format.

145
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:08,629
And, similar to, all the cloud native
infrastructure where the IAM module takes

146
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:13,700
care of the, user, security, even here,
the specialist agents takes care of.

147
00:10:14,135 --> 00:10:16,985
Connecting, user security
and data security.

148
00:10:17,975 --> 00:10:21,905
Similarly, we can build any number of
AI specialized agents, and these AI

149
00:10:21,905 --> 00:10:29,710
agents ensure, to complete a specific
task or resolve a specific problem.

150
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,445
This is a pictor representation
of how agentic workflow in

151
00:10:38,015 --> 00:10:39,455
E-A-A-D-A integration happens.

152
00:10:40,175 --> 00:10:42,335
First, the rating partner
requirements are submitted.

153
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,090
to the customer service agent.

154
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:49,060
The customer service agents, in its
own natural language processing,

155
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:54,290
redefines it and marks down as various
steps and send it to the orchestrator.

156
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,420
The, a orchestrator then takes those,
whole checklist and redefines them.

157
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,260
As modular components that will be
assigned to the specialist agent.

158
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,940
From there, if there are any EEA EDA
requirements, the validation agents

159
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:14,220
ensures that the data or the format
that is required or specified in

160
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,840
the requirements, follow a specific
protocol or specific validation.

161
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,340
From there, there is a technical
processing phase where it evaluates

162
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,470
the best possible optimal.

163
00:11:26,975 --> 00:11:27,815
set up strategy.

164
00:11:28,265 --> 00:11:33,005
The whole, process is being then
implemented, using the corresponding

165
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:38,265
application and communicated, to the
database for ensuring that the end-to-end

166
00:11:38,505 --> 00:11:40,185
business process flow is completed.

167
00:11:41,385 --> 00:11:47,715
This process flow is being validated
and quality assured by the qualities

168
00:11:47,885 --> 00:11:53,735
assuring agent, and the further data is
being used for training the AA agents.

169
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:59,420
This is a simple workflow that explains
the EDA integration post implementing

170
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,640
agents in the integration space.

171
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:10,250
Agent TK implementation in enterprises
do come up with its own challenges,

172
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,610
data privacy, concern being the primary.

173
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:18,230
One of them organizations are really
worried about the sensitive data

174
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,090
exposure to the AA processing.

175
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,880
Our approach in this architecture uses
federated learning techniques that

176
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,910
allows models to improve without raw
data leaving secure environments, and

177
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:37,310
we also ensure specialized encryption
techniques are being followed

178
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,720
throughout the business process.

179
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,220
This maintains the compliance
and regulations like global data

180
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,810
privacy regulations and hipaa.

181
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,740
The second is legacy
system integration issues.

182
00:12:49,655 --> 00:12:54,065
Most legacy system doesn't even have
an a PE capability and there are

183
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:59,175
many limited connectivity, that are
available for these agents to connect.

184
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:06,525
So ma making these agents work with these
legacy systems is one issue, and these

185
00:13:06,825 --> 00:13:08,920
two are not the primary issues alone.

186
00:13:09,345 --> 00:13:12,495
There could be like a cultural
resistance, there could be also

187
00:13:12,765 --> 00:13:15,075
issues with, other governance issues.

188
00:13:15,315 --> 00:13:18,465
Our approach is not a
big bandwidth method.

189
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:24,855
Let us go with a phased manner where
you decide and define only a specific

190
00:13:24,855 --> 00:13:31,585
agent where, the organization is
comfortable with, and you expose the only

191
00:13:31,585 --> 00:13:37,865
those data that are not as sensitive,
or not sensitive for this particular

192
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:42,475
agent, and see how these agents,
explore and provide business value.

193
00:13:42,475 --> 00:13:48,640
I. Based on this approach, we can
definitely, keep scaling these agents

194
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:53,610
for different, applications and on
a phase manner we should be able to

195
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,370
achieve the highest autonomy levels.

196
00:14:01,815 --> 00:14:06,355
These, agents also enhance the
observability framework, which

197
00:14:06,355 --> 00:14:09,265
is a key pillar of SRE model.

198
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:16,300
Comprehensive tracing, business
aligned, service level objectives

199
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,830
and predictive alerting.

200
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,600
These are all required for a
successful business to be relevant

201
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,790
and successful in the business.

202
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:30,130
The end to end visibility in every
transaction is important for ma

203
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:34,480
various stakeholders, so that has
to be inbuilt in this whole agent

204
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,270
process and business aligned.

205
00:14:37,735 --> 00:14:41,185
service level objectives that
directly reflect business impact

206
00:14:41,455 --> 00:14:45,535
rather than technical metrics,
bridging the gap between IT

207
00:14:45,535 --> 00:14:47,275
performance and business outcomes.

208
00:14:48,865 --> 00:14:53,935
A driven predictive alerting based on
understanding the data and business

209
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:59,950
flow and completely training the
previous transactions, help and

210
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,855
enhance the observability framework.

211
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:11,685
Another feature of this whole, agent
TK is self-healing capabilities.

212
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:17,455
First is the anomaly detection where
whenever there is an, hallucination

213
00:15:17,455 --> 00:15:21,985
in the GT K or if there is an issue
with the business process flow,

214
00:15:22,465 --> 00:15:26,755
this whole infrastructure takes
care of identifying those anomalies

215
00:15:26,935 --> 00:15:29,355
and deduct it, automatically.

216
00:15:29,745 --> 00:15:35,615
And then identifies what caused these
anomalies by root cast analysis.

217
00:15:36,095 --> 00:15:41,645
And that provides a list of checklists
that needs to be done for remediation and

218
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:44,495
that is handled in an automatic fashion.

219
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:50,645
And this whole process is logged
in our knowledge base so that

220
00:15:51,065 --> 00:15:53,485
the next, agent or any other.

221
00:15:54,145 --> 00:15:57,925
Business process doesn't face the same
issue again, and the remediation step

222
00:15:57,925 --> 00:16:00,265
can be implemented wherever is required.

223
00:16:00,985 --> 00:16:05,065
This health healing capability
enhances this whole integration

224
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:07,385
process, to your new level of SRE.

225
00:16:11,675 --> 00:16:16,505
This chart shows post implementation
of Agent TK in different sectors

226
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:18,965
in our evaluation metrics and.

227
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:26,240
It shows that healthcare has 87% financial
services has 94%, manufacturing has 79%.

228
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,070
Retail has 82%.

229
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,230
Logistic has 91% improvement.

230
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,310
this helps patient care efficient
processing time, reducing the

231
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:38,780
waste, improving the sales,
improving and optimizing the

232
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,550
supply chain in various sectors.

233
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,210
This definitely shows that implementing
the agent TK in any sector is a boom.

234
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,920
These are the key metrics that are
recorded post the implementation of

235
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:02,030
Agent K in application integration,
92% reduction in MTTR 78% fewer

236
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:07,950
incidents and 320% throughput
increase, and 99.99% system uptime.

237
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,890
These are impressive numbers and this will
definitely drive business to implement

238
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:16,080
Agent K in enterprise integration.

239
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,680
All these values, definitely impact
the, business baseline and make

240
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,090
the business more competitive.

241
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,820
These metrics definitely prove a
point that agent TK is the future

242
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,990
of integration and a business
will reap benefit out of it.

243
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,580
