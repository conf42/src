00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,750
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:09,070
I'm Teta with about 15 years of
experience into integration and AI

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,580
and enterprise integration platforms.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,030
So today we are exploring how machine
learning acts as a catalyst for

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,740
cloud native digital transformation
over the next several flights.

6
00:00:24,115 --> 00:00:30,375
We will see how embedding ml into
microservices containers and serverless

7
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:36,735
architectures not only accelerates
innovation, but also drives operational

8
00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:40,035
efficiencies that weren't possible before.

9
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:40,560
So

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:47,270
before diving into the topic, let's just
cover the evolution of cloud architecture.

11
00:00:48,255 --> 00:00:50,355
Let's begin with cloud architecture.

12
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:55,885
We started with traditional monolithic
applications, static, tightly

13
00:00:55,885 --> 00:00:58,675
coupled and hard to scale systems.

14
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:03,564
Then came lift and shift migrations
to the cloud where we gained

15
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:07,970
better sources utilization, but
little architectural change.

16
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:14,909
Cloud native approaches broke these
monolithics into microservices

17
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:20,809
in containers with orchestration
delivering resilience and flexibility.

18
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:28,909
So finally, by augmenting this model with
embedded ml, our systems continuously

19
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:33,759
learn and adapt unblocking predictive
and automated decision making.

20
00:01:35,134 --> 00:01:39,934
In the next slide let's just look about
the distributed computing benefits.

21
00:01:41,654 --> 00:01:48,274
Deploying ML in a cloud native environment
lets us leverage distributed computing

22
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:55,604
to its fullest, VHU around 10 to 20 times
faster training via paralyzed pipelines.

23
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:00,549
Elastic scaling automatically
matches resources to demand.

24
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:07,139
So a petabyte scale data
processing becomes routine and

25
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,419
we only pay for what we use.

26
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:13,669
So we would be optimizing costs.

27
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:18,719
So together these capabilities
enable us to tackle complex

28
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:21,989
problems at unprecedented scale.

29
00:02:23,264 --> 00:02:23,684
Speed.

30
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:31,214
So now let's look about the
intelligent automation capabilities.

31
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:37,674
So ML driven cloud integration powers
intelligent automation across it

32
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:44,204
operations With predictive scaling systems
can anticipate spikes before they occur.

33
00:02:45,029 --> 00:02:51,269
So self-op optimization tunes parameters
continuously based on performance data and

34
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:56,969
automated security detects and neutralizes
threats without manual intervention.

35
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:03,979
So organizing organizations leveraging
these features report around 45 to

36
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:10,029
60% of less downtime and 30 to 40%
of greater resource efficiency.

37
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:16,959
Now let's look at the cross cloud
mul machine learning deployment.

38
00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:25,539
So in hybrid and multi-cloud world, we
need seamless ml across environments.

39
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:31,569
So centralized governance ensures
consistent model management, monitoring

40
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:33,264
and security policies everywhere.

41
00:03:34,404 --> 00:03:39,564
Edge deployments push inference
closer to latency sensitive users.

42
00:03:40,244 --> 00:03:45,994
Provider optimization lets us exploit
hardware accelerators or pricing

43
00:03:46,264 --> 00:03:51,814
advantages and failover, recie
keep predictions services running

44
00:03:52,414 --> 00:03:54,334
even when a region goes offline.

45
00:03:55,024 --> 00:03:58,484
So this flexibility strategy
maximizes performance.

46
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,124
While guarding continuity.

47
00:04:03,194 --> 00:04:07,304
Now in the next slide, we will be
looking at the implementation challenges.

48
00:04:07,754 --> 00:04:13,114
In the implementation challenges in
today's integrating ML into a cloud

49
00:04:13,114 --> 00:04:15,544
native systems is not without hurdles.

50
00:04:16,054 --> 00:04:21,754
So models can drift as real world
data changes, demanding continuous

51
00:04:21,754 --> 00:04:23,434
monitoring and retraining.

52
00:04:24,724 --> 00:04:29,804
Deep Networks act as black boxes
making inter interpretability

53
00:04:29,864 --> 00:04:32,054
and audit auditability difficult.

54
00:04:32,684 --> 00:04:37,724
So ensuring high quality data across
distributed services remains a

55
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:44,274
perennial struggle and new security
risks advisor attacks, model poisoning.

56
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:47,294
Privacy leaks require robust defenses.

57
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,239
So overcoming these challenges
for structured processes

58
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:52,739
and specialized skillsets.

59
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:59,609
Now let's look at what are the
emerging solutions for this integrating

60
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:01,469
ML into cloud native systems.

61
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:10,359
So emerging, the ecosystem is
evolving rapidly, so ML ops platforms

62
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:12,729
automate the end-to-end lifecycle.

63
00:05:13,074 --> 00:05:18,164
From data prep through deployment,
slashing deployment times by almost

64
00:05:18,224 --> 00:05:21,525
80% and enforcing reproducibility.

65
00:05:22,215 --> 00:05:28,794
So ex explainable AI frameworks
like SHAP and LIME, demystify

66
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:33,434
model behavior to build trust
and meet compliance requirements.

67
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:40,234
Federated learning lets us train on
decentralized data without ever moving it.

68
00:05:41,164 --> 00:05:44,004
Preserving privacy and
cutting bandwidth costs.

69
00:05:44,604 --> 00:05:48,745
These innovations make cloud
native ML far more accessible.

70
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:53,484
So now let's look about the
business impact metrics.

71
00:05:53,945 --> 00:05:58,595
When we measure the outcomes,
the gains are striking.

72
00:05:58,645 --> 00:06:05,245
Teams deploying ML powered cloud solutions
bring new features to market 65% faster.

73
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,320
So operational efficiency leaps forward.

74
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,760
So customer satisfaction and
employee productivity both ways.

75
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:19,180
And while revenue growth improvements may
appear modest in percentage terms, they

76
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,360
translate into significant absolute gains.

77
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:31,080
So leaders report around 20 to 30, 20
to 30% higher growth versus pace relying

78
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,640
on the conventional architecture.

79
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,550
So now let's look at, look, let's
look about the implementation

80
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,620
framework for this ml integration.

81
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,460
So

82
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,550
a proven roadmap ensures
these benefits materialize.

83
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,220
First, conduct a strategic
assessment to align ML initiatives

84
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,270
with business priorities Next.

85
00:06:57,245 --> 00:07:00,985
Design your cloud native ML
architecture defining microservices,

86
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:03,025
data pipelines and governance.

87
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:10,645
Then run a focused POC or proof of concept
to validate assumptions and demonstrate

88
00:07:10,825 --> 00:07:13,645
clear RYA, written on investment.

89
00:07:14,425 --> 00:07:18,905
Finally, scaling successful patterns
enterprise wide building the

90
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:23,740
organizational confidence and operational
rigor you need for long-term success.

91
00:07:25,615 --> 00:07:31,455
So what are the future trends
in this article in this area?

92
00:07:31,505 --> 00:07:32,465
What's on the horizon?

93
00:07:32,795 --> 00:07:37,655
Autonomous ML promises self designing
neural architectures that minimize

94
00:07:37,745 --> 00:07:39,635
human effort in model creation.

95
00:07:40,385 --> 00:07:43,015
AI specific hardware think AI optimize.

96
00:07:43,015 --> 00:07:47,975
The processors in the cloud will deliver
order of magnitude performance boosts.

97
00:07:48,545 --> 00:07:53,645
So mesh intelligence will embed,
distribute distributed ML throughout

98
00:07:53,675 --> 00:07:58,205
and organization ecosystem, enabling
services to share insights seamlessly

99
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:05,115
and natural interfaces conversational
and multimodal will put ML capabilities

100
00:08:05,115 --> 00:08:07,035
directly into the hands of business users.

101
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,470
Without running requiring
specialized technical skills.

102
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,290
So what are the key takeaways and
the action plan in this session?

103
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,590
So to wrap up four priorities
will set you up for success.

104
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:27,500
First, align each ML initiative with
clear business value and metrics.

105
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,320
Second ensure your platform is truly
cloud native containers microservices.

106
00:08:33,295 --> 00:08:38,925
Infrastructure as code before you layer
on the ml. Third, invest in DataOps

107
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:43,935
and ML ops to automate the pipelines,
maintain model quality at scale.

108
00:08:44,205 --> 00:08:49,285
And lastly, upskill your team
upskilling combining data science

109
00:08:49,645 --> 00:08:54,355
cloud, cloud engineering, and domain
expertise in cross-functional squads.

110

So following this action plan, and you
will build adaptive intelligent systems.

111
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,800
That continuously drive business values.

112
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:09,670
And lastly, thank you everyone for your
time and detection and how I hope this

113
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:15,310
discussion has given you a clear view of
how ML and Cloud Native patterns coverage

114
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,850
to accelerate digital transformation.

115
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,960
I'm happy to take any questions or
dive deeper into any of these topics.
