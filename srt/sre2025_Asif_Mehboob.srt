1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,950
Hey everyone, this is Asaf Mabu, and
today we are diving into how we can

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,700
revolutionize legacy systems with
the power of t net and microservices,

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,389
thereby transforming your rigid,
monolithic architectures into an

4
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:13,309
agile and more scalable ecosystem.

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,830
Now, legacy systems, although
reliable, they bring with them a

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,219
lot of complexity and are often
inflexible with the capabilities

7
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:21,899
of a modern framework like T net.

8
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,709
We can redesign these systems without
needing a complete rebuild from scratch.

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,150
By using microservices, we break down
these legacy systems, also sometimes

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,720
known as monoliths into smaller,
more independent and more manageable

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,709
chunks that allow for scalability
and adaptability, depending upon

12
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:39,209
the changing needs of your business.

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,710
Now, using microservices not only enhances
your applications, agility, which is

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,430
the speed with which your code can adapt
to your changing business needs, but

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,800
it also provides a certain degree of,
future proofing into your applications.

16
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,160
you get faster deployments, you get
quicker turnarounds, you get better fault

17
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,900
isolation, and essentially more efficient
use of resources with this approach.

18
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,500
So in the next few minutes, we'll
explore how dotnet and microservices

19
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,150
work together and, transform legacy
systems and, why this transformation

20
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,920
is essential for your organization.

21
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,030
So let's get started.

22
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,820
in my experience, legacy systems present
major challenges for organizations.

23
00:01:16,195 --> 00:01:18,055
They act as roadblocks to innovation.

24
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:21,355
They slow down growth and they
prevent development of new features.

25
00:01:21,535 --> 00:01:24,955
Now, over time, the cost of maintaining
these outdated systems also rises,

26
00:01:25,195 --> 00:01:28,045
and the specialized expertise that
you need to support them becomes

27
00:01:28,045 --> 00:01:30,115
harder and more expensive to find.

28
00:01:30,745 --> 00:01:34,165
Now, beyond operational concerns,
legacy systems also pose serious

29
00:01:34,165 --> 00:01:37,915
security risks since they lack
all of these modern protections.

30
00:01:38,155 --> 00:01:42,295
So that leaves the organization vulnerable
to compliance issues and cyber threats.

31
00:01:42,985 --> 00:01:47,215
So if we want to remain competitive, we
must, address these challenges head on.

32
00:01:47,665 --> 00:01:51,355
Modernizing our technology is not
just an IT initiative anymore,

33
00:01:51,385 --> 00:01:52,825
it's actually a business necessity.

34
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:56,305
So let's take a small example
to illustrate the challenges and

35
00:01:56,305 --> 00:01:59,215
issues with legacy systems and
this monolithic architecture.

36
00:01:59,425 --> 00:02:00,055
Right now.

37
00:02:00,055 --> 00:02:02,065
Let's consider this video
that I'm currently recording.

38
00:02:02,305 --> 00:02:05,485
Let's say I recorded this entire
session in a single continuous,

39
00:02:05,524 --> 00:02:09,005
recording, and then I need to apply
some effects between each slide.

40
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:12,515
So I write a script that will apply
certain effects at certain timings

41
00:02:12,515 --> 00:02:17,015
In this video and on post review,
I decide that slide number X and

42
00:02:17,015 --> 00:02:20,224
slide number Y need to be updated
and I need to record them again.

43
00:02:20,885 --> 00:02:23,825
So since this is a continuous
session, I would either have to redo

44
00:02:23,825 --> 00:02:27,815
my entire session, or I would have
to use certain complicated tools to

45
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,885
replace these parts of these videos.

46
00:02:30,544 --> 00:02:35,284
So then I would have to write, rewrite the
timings on my script, and all subsequent

47
00:02:35,284 --> 00:02:36,935
timings would also need to be adjusted.

48
00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:36,964
It.

49
00:02:37,445 --> 00:02:41,825
So you see how a small change easily
snowballs into this massive effort.

50
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:45,875
On the other hand, if I were to record
this session as one video per slide

51
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:49,774
and later just merge all the videos,
making edits to individual sessions

52
00:02:49,774 --> 00:02:53,914
would just be as easy as rerecording
that particular slide video and

53
00:02:53,914 --> 00:02:55,115
then merging them all over again.

54
00:02:55,505 --> 00:02:58,414
My script would not have to be
reworked because, each script

55
00:02:58,414 --> 00:02:59,809
would be built to be run at.

56
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:03,729
the end of a particular slide and the
timing on the slides would have no

57
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:05,669
effect, as to when the script ran.

58
00:03:06,179 --> 00:03:09,289
Now, of course, this is a very simplistic
way of, looking at this whole thing,

59
00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:13,419
but I hope this gives you an idea of,
how monolithic systems differ from

60
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:15,249
these, microservices based architecture.

61
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:18,799
like I said, modernizing your
system is no longer optional.

62
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:20,929
It's actually a strategic necessity.

63
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:24,619
The key drivers are clear,
better user experience, reduced

64
00:03:24,619 --> 00:03:26,389
costs, enhanced security.

65
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:27,949
And improve scalability.

66
00:03:28,369 --> 00:03:32,759
Now, intuitive and user-friendly
interfaces are essential to provide a good

67
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:35,039
user experience and improve productivity.

68
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:39,209
At the same time, modernization reduces
maintenance and operational expenses.

69
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:41,589
it delivers significant cost savings.

70
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:46,149
And with the ever-growing cyber threats,
modern security measures are all the

71
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:50,849
more important to protective, your
sensitive data and ensuring compliance.

72
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,949
as your, organization grows, your
scalable systems will allow you to

73
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:57,669
expand without, compromising performance.

74
00:03:57,999 --> 00:04:01,209
And by embracing modernization,
organizations position

75
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:02,799
themselves for long-term success.

76
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,899
They offer better user experiences.

77
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:08,139
They lower costs, they
strengthen security, and they

78
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:09,189
prepare for future growth.

79
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:13,649
Now, the Dotnet platform has undergone
significant evolution over the years.

80
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:18,000
It began with the Dotnet framework, which
was a Windows only platform that offered.

81
00:04:18,354 --> 00:04:19,974
rich Libraries and Services.

82
00:04:20,254 --> 00:04:23,404
this was then followed by T Net
Core, which was an open source

83
00:04:23,404 --> 00:04:26,624
cross platform version, which was
designed for better performance.

84
00:04:26,864 --> 00:04:28,964
And then starting with T Net five.

85
00:04:28,964 --> 00:04:32,084
And as of today, I think it's dotnet
nine, the latest version of T net.

86
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:34,074
Microsoft Unified these two worlds.

87
00:04:34,104 --> 00:04:39,084
So T net now combines the robustness
of dotnet framework and also the

88
00:04:39,084 --> 00:04:41,704
flexibility and speed of dotnet, code.

89
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:45,049
So this timeline visually
highlights the key milestones in

90
00:04:45,049 --> 00:04:46,699
the journey of, the doted platform.

91
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:51,139
So here are some benefits that
we saw at our organization by

92
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:52,459
moving to this new architecture.

93
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:57,689
we now have a 24 7 development cycle with,
continuous operations across three shift.

94
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:01,529
So this ensures that our software is
constantly evolving and improving.

95
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:05,069
Modernizing our DO net
infrastructure has also accelerated

96
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:07,949
our development speed by 67%.

97
00:05:08,514 --> 00:05:11,394
this allows us to, deliver
new features faster than ever.

98
00:05:11,964 --> 00:05:16,294
Also, by optimizing our computing
resources, we have increased efficiency

99
00:05:16,294 --> 00:05:21,294
by 40%, and this enables us to achieve
more while, using fewer resources.

100
00:05:21,794 --> 00:05:24,104
So what are microservices?

101
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:29,984
Microservices are essentially small,
independent services that collaborate

102
00:05:30,014 --> 00:05:31,964
to deliver specific business functions.

103
00:05:32,234 --> 00:05:35,774
Each microservice performs one
and only one business function.

104
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:40,344
Now, unlike monolithic architectures,
microservices are decoupled, this

105
00:05:40,344 --> 00:05:44,544
means that microservices can be
independently developed and deployed.

106
00:05:45,114 --> 00:05:48,594
The key characteristics of microservices
include being loosely coupled,

107
00:05:48,844 --> 00:05:52,114
business focused, independently
deployable, and resilient.

108
00:05:52,804 --> 00:05:55,924
Now, this slide offers a high level
introduction to the microservices

109
00:05:55,924 --> 00:05:59,404
architectural style, and this is the
foundation for the rest of the session.

110
00:05:59,904 --> 00:06:02,304
Now, why should we use microservices?

111
00:06:02,934 --> 00:06:07,074
microservices architecture allows us to
scale individual components independently.

112
00:06:07,344 --> 00:06:11,514
It supports up to 40% annual growth
in system capacity, and, this

113
00:06:11,514 --> 00:06:13,314
design enhances fault isolation.

114
00:06:13,844 --> 00:06:14,894
what is fault isolation?

115
00:06:14,944 --> 00:06:18,484
if one service fails, the rest of
your system remains unaffected.

116
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:20,104
So greater reliability.

117
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:23,164
It also gives us the flexibility
to choose the best tools and

118
00:06:23,164 --> 00:06:25,294
technology for each service.

119
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,655
This avoids the limitation of,
this one size fits all approach.

120
00:06:29,194 --> 00:06:33,779
So if I want to develop a microservice and
t net because, it gives good performance

121
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:38,729
in database suites and, develop this other
one in, Python because it has this one

122
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:42,989
library that performs this particular math
function very efficiently and quickly.

123
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,159
I can, most importantly, the modular
structure allows us to deliver new

124
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:51,929
features and fixes faster, which in
turn means faster time to market huge

125
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:54,239
advantage in a competitive landscape.

126
00:06:54,739 --> 00:06:58,849
Microservices architecture allows, teams
to deploy new features independently

127
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:00,469
without updating the entire system.

128
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:04,649
it reduces the overhead of coordinating
with multiple teams in order to release

129
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:09,659
a new feature or bug fix, and eventually
it accelerates development, deployment,

130
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:11,569
and most importantly, innovation.

131
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:14,989
It also supports a fail
fast, learn quickly mindset.

132
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:18,709
This allows teams to experiment with new
ideas and test them with minimal risk.

133
00:07:19,364 --> 00:07:19,514
more.

134
00:07:19,514 --> 00:07:23,204
Our microservices align seamlessly
with modern DevOps practices.

135
00:07:23,264 --> 00:07:25,694
So think automation and
continuous delivery.

136
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:30,854
This boosts agility and helps teams
deliver value faster and more efficiently.

137
00:07:31,354 --> 00:07:34,944
So how do we go about modernizing
our, legacy applications?

138
00:07:35,044 --> 00:07:38,464
there are four primary approaches
and each of these have varying

139
00:07:38,464 --> 00:07:40,224
complexity and, impact.

140
00:07:40,734 --> 00:07:43,524
The first is rehosting, also
known as lift and shift.

141
00:07:43,884 --> 00:07:48,044
This simply moves your application to
more, modern, infrastructure and does

142
00:07:48,044 --> 00:07:49,754
not alter your code in any shape or form.

143
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:51,944
The next one is refactoring.

144
00:07:52,154 --> 00:07:55,634
Now this improves the internal code,
quality and structure, but keeps the

145
00:07:55,634 --> 00:07:57,764
applications, external behavior the same.

146
00:07:58,404 --> 00:07:59,994
then we have re-architecting.

147
00:08:00,024 --> 00:08:03,684
Now this involves more significant
structural changes to your

148
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:07,114
code, which then unlocks newer
capabilities for your application.

149
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,100
and the final one that we have is
rebuilding, which involves fully

150
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,250
recreating the application with,
modern technologies and approaches.

151
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,940
Now, of course, each of these method
offers distinct benefits for your

152
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,380
organization, and it all depends
on your goals and your, resources.

153
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,479
To kick off our modernization
journey, the first step is a thorough

154
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:26,979
analysis of your current system.

155
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,349
We'll begin by identifying
key stakeholders.

156
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,130
This includes business users, IT
teams, and other critical players.

157
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,559
this will help us understand the
business context and the user

158
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,870
needs, which will then allow us to
capture the essential requirements.

159
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,650
Next, we'll create detailed system,
architecture diagrams, document all

160
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,390
components and the dependencies.

161
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,680
And, this will allow us to gain a complete
picture of the current environment.

162
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,280
Finally, we'll assess the
system's technical debt, which is

163
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,300
evaluating the code quality and
identifying performance bottlenecks.

164
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,210
and anything that requires our attention.

165
00:09:01,005 --> 00:09:05,505
A deep understanding of the current state
is absolutely essential before we can move

166
00:09:05,505 --> 00:09:07,635
forward with our modernization strategy.

167
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:12,245
So as we embark on this modernization
journey, it's essential that

168
00:09:12,245 --> 00:09:15,245
we define clear business
objectives and success metrics.

169
00:09:15,865 --> 00:09:19,195
we need to find the right strategy
for each system component.

170
00:09:19,195 --> 00:09:22,705
Now whether that's re-platforming,
refactoring, re-architecting, it

171
00:09:22,705 --> 00:09:25,645
all depends on the specific needs
and goals of your organization.

172
00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:27,875
detailed roadmap should then be developed.

173
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,705
we need to outline the transition
steps and the timeline.

174
00:09:31,275 --> 00:09:35,265
Finally, we need to secure full
stakeholder alignment and ensure we have

175
00:09:35,265 --> 00:09:39,405
the necessary resources and support as
that is critical to executing this plan.

176
00:09:39,435 --> 00:09:40,065
Successfully.

177
00:09:40,315 --> 00:09:43,375
as monolithic applications
grow in complexity, they can

178
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,815
become difficult to maintain.

179
00:09:44,965 --> 00:09:48,175
So breaking them down into
smaller focused microservices,

180
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:49,955
can help solve this problem.

181
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:54,275
The first step in this process is
identifying your bounded context,

182
00:09:54,305 --> 00:09:58,405
so essentially mapping business
domains to, distinct context

183
00:09:58,435 --> 00:09:59,905
and defining clear boundaries.

184
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:03,085
This ensures that each of your
service will have a well-defined

185
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:04,855
scope and responsibility.

186
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,140
Next, we define the service boundaries,
which is designing each service

187
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,450
around a specific business capability.

188
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,930
The aim is to keep the
services focused and cohesive.

189
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,840
this avoids complexities that can,
arise from trying to cover too many

190
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,220
areas in, one or many services.

191
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:25,580
effective communication between
these services is also key, so

192
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,360
APIs and messaging patterns are
used to define integration points

193
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,160
and data flows between services.

194
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,240
thus ensuring smooth interactions.

195
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,290
Finally, we create service templates
to standardize development processes,

196
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,500
enabling, consistent implementation across
teams working on different microservices.

197
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,620
Now, this approach helps us,
achieve better scalability, better

198
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,940
maintainability, and, of course agility
in your application development process.

199
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,150
By migrating to scalable cloud
databases, we can utilize managed

200
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,990
services to dynamically expand
our data infrastructure as needed.

201
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,350
by implementing repositories, ORs,
and data abstraction layers, we

202
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:06,270
will be able to simplify our data
access and, improve usability.

203
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,700
Maintaining data integrity across services
and employing eventual consistency

204
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,450
strategies, is crucial for ensuring that,
we have consistency in our distributed.

205
00:11:16,465 --> 00:11:17,035
Systems.

206
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:22,005
Lastly, enforcing encryption, strict
access controls and, robust data

207
00:11:22,005 --> 00:11:25,365
protection measures will, greatly
strengthen the security of our data layer.

208
00:11:25,865 --> 00:11:29,225
Now, implementing A-C-I-C-D
pipeline is a key step in

209
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:31,145
automating your software delivery.

210
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:35,825
This ensures a consistent, reliable,
and scalable deployment process.

211
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:39,475
So the key components include
automated bills that, compile your

212
00:11:39,475 --> 00:11:41,035
code and then run your unit test.

213
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:45,125
containerization to package your
application and its dependencies.

214
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:49,575
an orchestration platform like Kubernetes
to manage and scale your containers.

215
00:11:49,695 --> 00:11:52,845
And then a deployment automation
with, release gates and monitoring.

216
00:11:53,535 --> 00:11:57,385
Now these, elements enable
fast and confident delivery of

217
00:11:57,385 --> 00:11:58,945
your new features and updates.

218
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:02,875
The diagrams on this slide showcase
the technical components and

219
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,825
flow of a modern CICD pipeline.

220
00:12:04,965 --> 00:12:07,395
this is all crucial for,
cloud native development.

221
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:11,465
The S-O-L-I-D principles are
five key design guidelines

222
00:12:11,555 --> 00:12:15,295
and, they promote maintainable,
extensible, and testable software.

223
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:19,395
two important design patterns
for, data access are repository

224
00:12:19,395 --> 00:12:21,175
and unit of work, patterns.

225
00:12:21,415 --> 00:12:23,905
These help organize and
manage your application data.

226
00:12:24,115 --> 00:12:27,745
also you have the factory method and
dependency injection patterns, which

227
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:29,305
enhance flexibility and testability.

228
00:12:29,555 --> 00:12:32,405
when you're optimizing for the
cloud, it's important to focus

229
00:12:32,405 --> 00:12:36,785
on autoscaling load balancing
caching and resource optimization.

230
00:12:37,305 --> 00:12:40,245
this ensures both performance
and cost efficiency.

231
00:12:40,785 --> 00:12:44,775
Incorporating these principles and
patterns into your refactoring process

232
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:48,615
will lead to improved code quality,
improved scalability and maintainability.

233
00:12:49,115 --> 00:12:52,685
Modernizing legacy systems comes
with a significant challenge.

234
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,300
First, there's a skill gap because
teams need new training, on the

235
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,730
new tools and practices, which
can then affect productivity as

236
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,810
they climb that learning curve.

237
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,560
second resource allocation.

238
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,620
it's important to balance resources
across services to prevent, performance

239
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,030
issues during this transition.

240
00:13:09,295 --> 00:13:13,230
Finally, managing distributed
complexity is a major hurdle as,

241
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,950
troubleshooting across various
services can become difficult when, the

242
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,095
components interact with each other.

243
00:13:18,855 --> 00:13:22,155
To successfully navigate these
challenges, a strategic and

244
00:13:22,185 --> 00:13:26,125
thoughtful approach is necessary,
when you're looking at modernization.

245
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:31,215
This case study showcases the, successful
modernization of a core banking platform,

246
00:13:31,495 --> 00:13:33,245
at a leading, financial institution.

247
00:13:33,305 --> 00:13:35,255
And, it delivers some remarkable results.

248
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:39,970
there was a 50%, reduction in operational
costs, 30% improvement in response time,

249
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:45,110
a 75%, faster deployment time, basically
reduced from a hundred to 25 hours.

250
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,270
there was a 40% increase
in developer productivity.

251
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:52,570
So basically these outcomes highlight,
the significant business benefits that

252
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:56,860
your organization can, gain as part
of a well executed, modernization.

253
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,620
As someone who's gone through this
exercise myself recently, I'd say

254
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,460
begin with small pilot projects to
demonstrate the value of modernization.

255
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,980
Before you go full throttle on
scaling up, focus on training.

256
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:11,490
Focus on upscaling your, team,
to, make sure that they have the

257
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,730
skills and the resources that are,
needed for this ongoing learning.

258
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,570
make sure you prioritize your
security, embed it at every stage of

259
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,900
the process and ensure that you have
compliance throughout this process.

260
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:27,315
Lastly, implement strong observability
and monitoring to continuously define

261
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:31,805
and optimize the transformation based on,
data that you collect from your world.

262
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:36,357
Now let's look at some of the future
trends in dotnet and microservices.

263
00:14:36,415 --> 00:14:40,535
there's serverless architecture,
particularly, function as a service.

264
00:14:40,845 --> 00:14:44,775
this is becoming a new standard due to
the cost effective pay execution model.

265
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:49,055
We have machine learning, which is now
being integrated as, into services,

266
00:14:49,465 --> 00:14:52,555
powering intelligent applications
with predictive capabilities.

267
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:56,445
there's edge computing, which is bringing,
processing closer to data sources.

268
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:59,755
thus, minimizing your latency
for your time operations.

269
00:15:00,365 --> 00:15:04,485
also web assembly, which is delivering
neo native performance and, browser

270
00:15:04,785 --> 00:15:08,085
unlocking, your, new distribution
possibilities for, applications.

271
00:15:08,585 --> 00:15:13,065
Lastly, digital transformation is not
just a one-time event, but an ongoing

272
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:14,565
journey of continuous improvement.

273
00:15:15,085 --> 00:15:19,475
by, embracing modernization, organizations
can stay ahead of the competition

274
00:15:19,535 --> 00:15:21,875
and seize, new market, opportunities.

275
00:15:22,385 --> 00:15:26,290
It's essential to build adaptable
foundations so that even with,

276
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:30,195
emerging technologies and newer
future trends, you will be poised

277
00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:31,905
perfectly to evolve with them.

278
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:37,200
Staying agile and committed to constant
improvement will make sure that with

279
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,220
rapid, changing business environment, your
organization is in a position of success.

280
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:47,390
and with this, I conclude my talk on
transforming legacy systems with.net

281
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:51,050
and microservices to build a more
scalable and agile application.

282
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,930
I hope you enjoyed this talk and
we'll consider some of these talking

283
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,200
points, when embarking on your own
journey at your own organization.

284
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,315
Hope you have a wonderful
rest of the conference.

285
00:16:00,775 --> 00:16:00,995
Bye.
