1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,495
Welcome everyone to our discussion.

2
00:00:02,595 --> 00:00:04,305
This is Ra Pala.

3
00:00:04,525 --> 00:00:08,184
Today we'll be discussing the
topic, mastering observability

4
00:00:08,184 --> 00:00:09,415
and distributed Systems.

5
00:00:09,684 --> 00:00:14,424
This is an important topic for analytics
leaders navigating complex environments.

6
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:18,549
Today we will explore the strategic
approach to achieving true visibility,

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,060
generating meaningful insights,
and driving impactful action

8
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:24,070
across your distributor systems.

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:29,890
The key is developing a comprehensive
observability strategy that goes beyond

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,269
just monitoring, it's about unlocking
the full potential of your idea.

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,769
To drive business outcomes, we will dive
into the critical capabilities required

12
00:00:37,949 --> 00:00:42,540
and share our real world examples of
how leading organizations are putting

13
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,940
observability into practice, right?

14
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,790
By the end I'm sure you'll have
a clear roadmap for elevating

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,200
observability as a strategic imperative
within your own organization.

16
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,060
So let's get started.

17
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,140
Let me dive into slide number two here.

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,100
So the business case for
observability is clear.

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,460
It delivers faster incident resolution.

20
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:09,020
Cost savings and improved
customer satisfaction.

21
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:16,220
Observability helps reduce meantime
to resolution by 73%, allowing us to

22
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,010
identify and fix issues more quickly.

23
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:24,320
It also leads to 42% cost savings
by optimizing our infrastructure

24
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,179
spend and reducing waste.

25
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:30,230
Most importantly, observability
drives a 91% increase.

26
00:01:30,545 --> 00:01:35,495
And customer satisfaction through
better user examples or experiences.

27
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:41,305
A 99.99% availability targets
translates to 22 minutes of

28
00:01:41,305 --> 00:01:42,805
allowable downtime per month.

29
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,170
As you see in the picture right
here, these metrics demonstrate the

30
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:52,630
tangible benefits of investing in
observability for our organization.

31
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:58,000
With observability, we can proactively
monitor our systems, rapidly, troubleshoot

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,320
our problems, and continuously
improve the services we deliver to our

33
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,990
customers and clients across the world.

34
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,700
As you look at this slide,
traditional monitoring focuses

35
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,780
on known issues with predefined
metrics and threshold based alerts.

36
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,730
This is reactive approach.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,630
In contrast, modern observability
aims to uncover unknown unknowns

38
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,340
and through high cardinality
telemetry and context rich insights.

39
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,210
This allows for more
proactive troubleshooting.

40
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,380
The key differences are that
observability deals with the unknown,

41
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,200
uses more comprehensive data, and
provides deeper context to drive

42
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,320
faster problem solving, right?

43
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,080
Observability gives you a more complex.

44
00:02:45,755 --> 00:02:49,745
Complete picture of your systems,
allowing you to be proactive rather

45
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:51,965
than just reacting to the issues.

46
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:58,705
With observability, you gain a more,
complete picture of your systems, allowing

47
00:02:58,705 --> 00:03:03,355
you to be proactive, like I mentioned,
rather than just reacting to the issues.

48
00:03:04,075 --> 00:03:07,675
And also with observability, you can
gain visibility into the unknown and

49
00:03:07,675 --> 00:03:11,995
unknowns that traditional monitoring
may miss leading to a better overall

50
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:13,855
system health and performance output.

51
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:15,045
This slide.

52
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:19,035
As you can see, observability is
a key capability that allows us to

53
00:03:19,035 --> 00:03:22,935
understand the health and performance
of our systems and applications.

54
00:03:23,435 --> 00:03:25,625
Again, it provides three main benefits.

55
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:31,520
Basically business insights giving us
visibility into the user journeys and

56
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,830
behaviors to inform product decisions.

57
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,120
Operational intelligence, helping
us detect patterns and anomalies

58
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,690
in systems behavior to quickly
identify and resolve issues.

59
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,240
Telemetry, foundation, essentially
providing the underlying data,

60
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,640
sources of traces, logs, and metrics
that power the other two areas.

61
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,690
Observability is not just a technical
capability, but also a strategic

62
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,400
data product that can deliver
value across the organization.

63
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:03,870
All right.

64
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,295
As you can see, we have there are
four pillars of observability.

65
00:04:07,795 --> 00:04:11,695
They are the key data sources that
provide visibility to the health

66
00:04:11,695 --> 00:04:13,045
and performance of a system.

67
00:04:13,705 --> 00:04:19,225
Metrics gives us the quantitative
measurements over time, like CPU, memory,

68
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:24,915
latency and throughput as you can see
logs provide detailed event records with

69
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:27,755
timestamp and structured data process.

70
00:04:27,815 --> 00:04:31,655
Show the request flows across
the services, helping us

71
00:04:31,655 --> 00:04:32,945
improve performance bot.

72
00:04:33,445 --> 00:04:38,185
Whereas events capture the state changes
and transitions like deployments and

73
00:04:38,185 --> 00:04:44,995
configuration changes together, these four
pillars gives us a comprehensive view into

74
00:04:44,995 --> 00:04:47,755
the behavior and operating of our systems.

75
00:04:48,595 --> 00:04:51,435
Now observability is critical
for understanding complex

76
00:04:51,435 --> 00:04:55,065
systems and identifying issues
before they impact the business.

77
00:04:55,165 --> 00:05:00,415
Analytics capabilities, like interactive
data exploration, machine learning driven

78
00:05:00,505 --> 00:05:05,930
anomaly detection, and predictive insights
can significantly enhance observability.

79
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,600
Data exploration allows you to query
across all your telemetry data to

80
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,785
uncover hidden patterns and trends.

81
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,850
Pattern recognition uses machine learning
can automatically detect anomalies

82
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,640
that may indicate emerging problems.

83
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,130
Correlating business and technical
data provides important context to

84
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,110
understand the impact of issues.

85
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,690
Predictive analytics can forecast
potential issues before they

86
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:37,350
actually occur, allowing you
to get ahead of the problems.

87
00:05:38,325 --> 00:05:44,625
These analytics capabilities gives us
a deeper, more proactive observability

88
00:05:44,805 --> 00:05:47,115
into your own systems and processes.

89
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:53,935
Alright, now this slide outlines the key
components of a scalable observability

90
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:56,815
architecture and also the infrastructure.

91
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:02,445
The instrumentation layer includes
tools like Open Telemetry agents and

92
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:07,725
SDKs to capture observability data
from applications and infrastructure.

93
00:06:08,225 --> 00:06:13,340
The collection and transport layer,
ingest the data using technologies like,

94
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,680
excuse me, Kafka, Panis, and Flint.

95
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,070
The storage and processing layer stores
the data in time series databases

96
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,870
and distributed tracing systems.

97
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,600
Finally, the analysis and visualization
layer, as you can see, provides

98
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,920
dashboards, notebooks, and alerting
to make sense of observability data.

99
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:40,370
Each of these layers plays a critical
role in building an end-to-end

100
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:45,530
observability pipeline that can scale
to handle growing volumes of data.

101
00:06:46,325 --> 00:06:47,315
In your systems.

102
00:06:47,815 --> 00:06:51,535
As you can see, the tooling landscape
for observability and monitoring

103
00:06:51,535 --> 00:06:55,555
is broad with many different
tools and technologies available.

104
00:06:55,655 --> 00:07:01,475
This slide provides a gallery of some of
the major players in the space, including.

105
00:07:02,045 --> 00:07:08,915
PROEs Grafana Elastic Search
Open Telemetry, Jagger, Datadog,

106
00:07:09,155 --> 00:07:11,195
new Relic, and Dynatrace.

107
00:07:11,915 --> 00:07:15,905
These tools cover a range of
capabilities from metrics collection and

108
00:07:15,905 --> 00:07:20,895
visualization to distributing, tracing
to full stack observability platforms.

109
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:26,495
When choosing tools for your observability
stack, it's important to evaluate the

110
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:31,235
specific needs of your organization
and architecture and how well each

111
00:07:31,235 --> 00:07:33,485
tool fits those requirements, right?

112
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:40,085
Some key factors to consider are ease
of use, scalability, integrations,

113
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:42,215
and oral cost and complexity.

114
00:07:42,715 --> 00:07:46,914
The right combination of tools can
provide deep visibility into the

115
00:07:46,914 --> 00:07:51,775
health and performance of your systems,
enabling faster, troubleshooting,

116
00:07:52,075 --> 00:07:55,605
and better patient making right now.

117
00:07:55,664 --> 00:07:56,865
Rolling onto the next slide.

118
00:07:57,365 --> 00:08:02,105
This slide outlines for common
pitfalls that organizations offer

119
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:06,305
encounter when managing their IT
operations and monitoring systems.

120
00:08:06,805 --> 00:08:11,225
The first pitfall is data deluge
collecting vast amounts of

121
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:12,455
data without a clear purpose.

122
00:08:12,955 --> 00:08:17,695
Leading to an overall overwhelming
signal to noise ratio that makes it

123
00:08:17,695 --> 00:08:19,975
difficult to extract meaningful insights.

124
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:25,735
The second pitfall is Tools Pro, having
a fragmented visibility across multiple

125
00:08:25,735 --> 00:08:30,505
platforms, making it challenging
to correlate and connect the data.

126
00:08:30,985 --> 00:08:34,200
The third pitfall is SLO ownership.

127
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,419
Where the platform teams work in
isolation, limiting the cross-functional

128
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:42,230
insights and collaboration needed
to effectively address issues.

129
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:47,660
The fourth pitfall is alert fatigue
where teams are bombarded with too

130
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:53,000
many notifications, many of which are
low value and disruptive, leading to a

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,820
lack of focus on the critical issues.

132
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,860
These are the common challenges that
organizations need to be aware of and

133
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,445
proactively address to improve their IT
operations and monitoring capabilities.

134
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,015
Moving on to the slide number 10 here.

135
00:09:08,705 --> 00:09:15,215
Observability is a key capability that
organizations need to measure over time.

136
00:09:15,575 --> 00:09:19,775
This slide outlines a four stage
maturity roadmap for observability.

137
00:09:20,275 --> 00:09:25,435
At the reactive stage, we are simply
responding to S after they have

138
00:09:25,435 --> 00:09:27,985
already, being impacted by the business.

139
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:33,310
The proactive stage is about
identifying issues as they emerge

140
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,620
before they cause major disruptions.

141
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,650
In the analytical stage, we gain
a deeper understanding of patterns

142
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,870
and dependencies in our systems.

143
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:48,540
The ultimate goal is to reach the
predictive stage where we can forecast

144
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,940
issues before they even occur.

145
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,280
Going to the next slide.

146
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:58,720
As you see most of the analytics leaders,
our role is to bridge the gap between the

147
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,990
technical and business domains, right?

148
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:06,220
Translating the telemetry and
insights as we gather into

149
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,960
the tangible business impact.

150
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,480
And we need to architect the data
driven feedback loops that correct the

151
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,189
insights we uncover to meaningful action
and change within the organization.

152
00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:21,869
As championing cross-functional
collaboration is a key here.

153
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,099
Breaking down silos between the
teams and getting everyone aligned

154
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:30,910
around a shared understanding of
the data is a very key point here.

155
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:36,099
Ultimately, our goal is to drive a
data literacy and culture empowering

156
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:41,739
everyone in the organization to
leverage insights as we surface to make

157
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:44,170
better and more informed decisions.

158
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,830
The sliding material here is
basically about the key takeaways

159
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:53,150
from our discussion today for
driving value from observability.

160
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:59,990
First, we need to clearly define
the business outcomes we want to

161
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:05,240
achieve and link our observability
efforts to those metrics.

162
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,319
Second.

163
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:12,560
We should start small by prior
prioritizing high impact services,

164
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,790
then scale our observability
capabilities incrementally over time.

165
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:23,000
Building cross-functional teams that blend
analytics and operations expertise will

166
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,550
be crucial for driving maximum value.

167
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:30,910
And the finally, the last STA is we
need to evolve our observability.

168
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:37,320
Maturity, step by step following the clear
roadmap to reach our desired future state.

169
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,080
So these steps will help ensure
our observability investments

170
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,235
deliver meaningful business
