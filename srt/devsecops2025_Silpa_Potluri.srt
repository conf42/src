00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,250
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:06,410
My name is Shilpa and I'm a staff software
engineer With our 20 years of experience

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,459
in software development and more than a
decade of specialization in the payments

4
00:00:10,459 --> 00:00:15,250
industry today I'll be talking about a
transformation that's reh reshaping the

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:21,180
financial technology world, how DevSecOps
plays a central role in securing payment

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,740
gateways during the migration from
monolithic architectures to microservice.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,510
This shift touches not just
technology, but also culture,

8
00:00:29,569 --> 00:00:31,310
process, and risk management.

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,680
So with that, let's begin.

10
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,290
To start, let's take a step back
and understand what's happening

11
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,670
in the payment gateway landscape.

12
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:45,370
For many years, payment systems were
built as large monolithics stable,

13
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,920
predictable, but extremely slow to change.

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,090
And because they handle sensitive
transactions, modifying them was

15
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,260
risky and involved long development
cycles, but the world changed.

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,740
We now have real-time payments, internal
international commerce, mobile first

17
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,350
users, and 24 by seven consumer demand.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,850
As a result, payment process began
shifting towards microservices

19
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:14,120
because microservices offer
agility, independent scaling, faster

20
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,400
updates, better fault isolation.

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,620
However, and this is important,
microservices also introduce

22
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,040
new complexities, especially
for security and compliance.

23
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,700
So this modernization is not just a
technical upgrade, it's a complete

24
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,900
reimagining of how security fits
into the software lifecycle.

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,745
With that foundation set,
let's talk about DevSecOps.

26
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,340
Traditionally, security happened at
the very end of the development cycle.

27
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,390
Developers wrote code.

28
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,460
QA tested it and only then
security reviewed everything.

29
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,630
This cause delays,
friction and bottlenecks.

30
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,580
And in the microservices world where
deployments happen multiple times a

31
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,040
day, this model simply doesn't scale.

32
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,550
That's where DevSecOps come.

33
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,009
DevSecOps integrates security
from the beginning, embedding in,

34
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,860
embedding it into design development,
built deployment operations.

35
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,950
It shifts security left, meaning
security moves earlier in the life cycle.

36
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,469
This ensures that security becomes
a continuous collaborative and

37
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,370
automated part of development
rather than a final checkpoint.

38
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,730
Now let's start transitioning to a
topic that is unavoidable in payments.

39
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:37,920
PCID S'S Compliance.

40
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,940
PCID.

41
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,200
S'S define strict rules for
protecting call holder data, access

42
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,405
control, network segmentation,
encryption, logging, and monitoring.

43
00:02:48,194 --> 00:02:52,394
In traditional monolithic systems,
organization relies, relied

44
00:02:52,394 --> 00:02:56,774
heavily on perimeter security,
isolated networks, firewalls, DMZs.

45
00:02:57,164 --> 00:03:00,765
But in microservices,
workflows are distributed.

46
00:03:01,004 --> 00:03:03,074
Data moves across many services.

47
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:07,094
Perimeter became less clear,
the attacks surface grows.

48
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:12,464
So complaints must evolve from being
network based to being service based.

49
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:15,884
And failure to comply could
result in heavy fines.

50
00:03:16,649 --> 00:03:20,999
Loss of processing privileges,
significant reputation damage.

51
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:27,420
In short complaints becomes a constant
priority, not something done once a year

52
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,420
with complaints in mind.

53
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:34,100
Let's shift into what changes
when you move to microservices.

54
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:38,690
There are three major paradigm
shifts, expanded attack surface.

55
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:43,805
Instead of one app, you now
have dozens of services, each

56
00:03:43,805 --> 00:03:45,425
one, a potential entry point.

57
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:50,645
Dynamic infrastructure, containers and
services scale up and down constantly.

58
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:54,925
Security controls must handle
rapid change, integrated

59
00:03:54,925 --> 00:03:56,365
security responsibility.

60
00:03:56,605 --> 00:03:59,365
Security is no longer
owned by just one team.

61
00:03:59,815 --> 00:04:03,475
Every team and every service
carries shared responsibility.

62
00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:07,915
This shift requires new tools, new
thinking, and new design patterns.

63
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,715
Now that we understand the
challenges, let's move into the

64
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:16,260
architectural solutions that help
secure microservices service mesh.

65
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,630
A service mesh provides mutual
TLS encryption, authorization

66
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,250
traffic policies all automatically,
meaning developers don't need

67
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,060
to manually code these features.

68
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,090
Next is API Gateways.

69
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,330
An API Gateway becomes
the secure front door.

70
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,400
It handles authentication rate, limiting
threat detection and input validation.

71
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,400
Lastly, zero trust.

72
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,080
Zero Trust essentially means
trust, nothing, verify everything.

73
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,980
Every service must authenticate
and authorized every

74
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,720
request, even internal ones.

75
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,740
Now let's talk about
protecting the data itself.

76
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,100
We use a layered approach.

77
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,560
Tokenization actual card
data is replaced with tokens

78
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,230
reducing PCI risk dramatically.

79
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:07,260
Encryption address stored data is
encrypted using strong keys and

80
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,150
managed through secure keywords.

81
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,060
Encryption in transit.

82
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,880
All network communication is
encrypted with TLS Secrets Management.

83
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,740
Secret Secrets must be stored
in secure walls, not in code

84
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,990
and environment files or repos.

85
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,550
With these combined, we
build defense in depth.

86
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,700
At this point, you might be thinking.

87
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,290
With so many security
checks, won't they slow us?

88
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,770
Slow us down, not if we automate.

89
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,050
Automation enables security to
keep pace with rapid deployments.

90
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:48,350
We automate static analysis checks code
for vulnerabilities early, and we automate

91
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,880
dynamic testing attacks the running
application to find runtime issues.

92
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:58,390
Name container scanning ensures images
and libraries are secure and up to date.

93
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,460
Automation turns security from
a body like into an enabler.

94
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,440
Now let's build on automation by
talking about infrastructure as code.

95
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:13,760
Infrastructure as code allows us to
define networks, servers, configurations,

96
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,040
security settings, all as code.

97
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,719
This provides consistency, version
control, and automated guardrails.

98
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,430
Similarly, there is compliance
as code, which converts PCR

99
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,115
requirements into automated checks.

100
00:06:27,995 --> 00:06:32,555
The sensor's complaints becomes
continuous, real time auditable.

101
00:06:32,945 --> 00:06:36,935
Instead of waiting for a quarterly
or an annual audit, we validate

102
00:06:36,935 --> 00:06:38,560
complaints on every deployment.

103
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,909
Now let's move into what
happens after the deployment.

104
00:06:42,405 --> 00:06:46,455
Even with strong prevention,
incident will still happen.

105
00:06:46,844 --> 00:06:49,455
So detection and response
become essential.

106
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:56,474
We rely on SIM systems, which collect
logs EV from everywhere to spot suspicious

107
00:06:56,474 --> 00:07:01,834
patterns, fraud detection models, analyze
transactions and behaviors in real time.

108
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:06,804
Distributed tracing allows us to
trace individual transactions across

109
00:07:06,804 --> 00:07:08,544
potentially dozens of microservices.

110
00:07:09,044 --> 00:07:13,394
Anomaly detection alerts when something
deviates from normal behavior.

111
00:07:13,894 --> 00:07:19,414
These capabilities give security teams
visibility and actionable insights.

112
00:07:19,914 --> 00:07:23,784
Now let's turn our attention
to the CICD pipelines, which is

113
00:07:23,784 --> 00:07:25,344
often the first line of defense.

114
00:07:25,844 --> 00:07:27,224
Source control, security.

115
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:31,905
This prevents secrets from being
committed, prevents secrets from

116
00:07:31,905 --> 00:07:35,914
being committed, requires code
reviews, and then coming to bill

117
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:42,564
process, analyzes dependencies and
libraries for vulnerabilities and

118
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:45,159
vulnerability issues, artifact signing.

119
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:51,139
Ensures all images and binaries are
trusted and unmodified deployment

120
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:56,049
gates block insecure builds
automatically, and then rollbacks

121
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,019
allow quick recovery during incidents.

122
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:03,099
Microservices rely heavily
on this pipeline discipline.

123
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,179
Next, let's talk about the cloud.

124
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:12,629
Since microservices often live there,
cloud platforms provide fine grained

125
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:18,539
identity access management network,
microsegmentation managed security

126
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,939
services, automated encryption.

127
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:26,729
However, the shared responsibility
model means organizations must still

128
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:33,029
secure application code configurations,
access permissions, cloud can strengthen

129
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:36,239
security, but only when used properly.

130
00:08:36,739 --> 00:08:39,140
How do organizations actually succeed?

131
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,199
Here are the proven
strategies phased migration.

132
00:08:43,699 --> 00:08:47,180
Start small, learn and iterate.

133
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:54,790
Security champions empower individuals
on each team to be security advocates.

134
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:00,209
Threat modeling, identify
risk early before writing code

135
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:02,104
realistic test environments.

136
00:09:02,604 --> 00:09:06,234
Mirror production closely to
catch real vulnerabilities.

137
00:09:07,134 --> 00:09:10,554
These approaches reduce risk
and increase predictability

138
00:09:11,054 --> 00:09:12,494
when implemented well.

139
00:09:12,944 --> 00:09:19,304
DevSecOps offers clear benefits,
stronger security posture, faster

140
00:09:19,304 --> 00:09:21,014
and more reliable releases.

141
00:09:21,824 --> 00:09:27,404
Easier compliance, better cross
team collaboration, a culture where

142
00:09:27,404 --> 00:09:30,434
security is shared, not siloed.

143
00:09:30,434 --> 00:09:35,414
Ultimately, DevSecOps aligns
both innovation and protection.

144
00:09:35,914 --> 00:09:38,729
As we wrap up, let's take a
forward looking perspective.

145
00:09:38,849 --> 00:09:38,879
Okay.

146
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:43,309
The shift from monolithic payment systems
to microservices is one of the most

147
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:49,099
significant transformations in FinTech,
but to succeed, organizations must commit

148
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:55,219
to new architectures, robust automation,
continuous monitoring, a culture change.

149
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:58,059
Security is not a one-time achievement.

150
00:09:58,119 --> 00:09:59,349
It's an ongoing journey.

151
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:05,589
Those who build security first cultures
will be the ones best positioned to handle

152
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:07,929
future threats and industry expectations.

153
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:10,124
Thank you so much for
your time and attention.
