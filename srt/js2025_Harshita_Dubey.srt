00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,370
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:05,750
I'm Harshita Doe from Apex FinTech
Solutions former with Technologies,

3
00:00:05,959 --> 00:00:09,920
and I'm thrilled to be here at
conference 42, data Script 2025.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,670
Today we are diving into how
embedded analytics and data

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,510
scripts are transforming enterprise
knowledge systems, turning what

6
00:00:17,515 --> 00:00:21,650
used to be static repositories into
dynamic intelligent ecosystems.

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,440
Let's start with the problem.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,150
More than 50% of the enterprise knowledge
systems fail to deliver real value.

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:32,260
We are talking about massive
organizations, a hundred K plus

10
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,590
employees across hundreds of
countries, spending millions on

11
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,450
tools that people don't actually use.

12
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,520
Our journey to fix this took 24
months, two years of transformation

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,540
to make knowledge accessible,
contextual, and measurable.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,870
Why do these systems fail?

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,220
First, static architectures
legacy tools can't keep up with

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,990
how modern themes actually work.

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,570
Second, disconnected content information
lives in silos, making it nearly

18
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,460
impossible to find what you need.

19
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,040
And third, poor user experience.

20
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,660
If finding information feels harder than
asking someone on Slack, people won't

21
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,335
self serve, and that's the reality.

22
00:01:11,835 --> 00:01:14,025
So how did we turn things around?

23
00:01:14,445 --> 00:01:17,565
We approach this like a
data-driven product transformation,

24
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,065
not just an IT project.

25
00:01:19,425 --> 00:01:23,955
We embedded analytics to understand
user behavior, mind search patterns,

26
00:01:23,955 --> 00:01:28,695
to uncover intent, built real-time
feedback loops, and enhance SharePoint

27
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,915
with custom JavaScript microservices.

28
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:34,570
In other words, we stopped guessing
and started listening to the data.

29
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,530
JavaScript was our engine
for transformation.

30
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,480
We built dynamic UI components that
adapt in real time to user behavior,

31
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:48,570
context aware filtering made sure people
saw only what was relevant to them, and

32
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,130
natural language search allowed users to
ask questions the way used humans too,

33
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,140
not the way research engines expect.

34
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,400
That's how we brought intelligence
and empathy into enterprise systems.

35
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,490
Here's a quick look under the hood.

36
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:06,080
We use SharePoint online as a secure
foundation, and on top of that, we layered

37
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:11,090
custom JavaScript, microservices handling
analytics, search and personalization.

38
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,980
The analytics engine processed live data
for insights, while the UI delivered

39
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,020
a responsive, tailored experience.

40
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,925
It's modular, scalable, and measurable.

41
00:02:21,425 --> 00:02:23,135
The results speak for themselves.

42
00:02:23,255 --> 00:02:26,045
We got information retrieval times by 33%.

43
00:02:26,465 --> 00:02:32,255
Self-service resolution jumped 22
points from 62% to 84%, and onboarding

44
00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:35,195
time also dropped by 21% in short.

45
00:02:35,435 --> 00:02:37,925
Employees found answers faster.

46
00:02:38,135 --> 00:02:41,905
Got up to speed quicker,
and less on support.

47
00:02:42,405 --> 00:02:46,155
From a business per standpoint,
the impact was just as powerful.

48
00:02:46,455 --> 00:02:51,165
We saved $3.7 million annually
through efficiency gains support.

49
00:02:51,165 --> 00:02:55,755
Tickets also dropped by 35% because
users were solving problems themselves.

50
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,215
Analytics didn't just improve experience.

51
00:02:58,395 --> 00:02:59,595
It drove measurable.

52
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:00,165
ROI.

53
00:03:00,665 --> 00:03:03,785
This transformation also
changed how we governed content.

54
00:03:04,235 --> 00:03:06,155
Our dashboards track engagement.

55
00:03:06,305 --> 00:03:07,085
What's working?

56
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:10,595
Watch it note analyzed where
users abandoned searches to

57
00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:14,705
fix broken experiences, and we
detected emerging needs before

58
00:03:14,705 --> 00:03:16,415
users even request new content.

59
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:19,745
It's governance powered
by insights, not instinct.

60
00:03:20,675 --> 00:03:24,995
At the core, three engines drive the
system intelligent search powered

61
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:29,705
by NLPA personalization engine
tuned to behavior and roles and real

62
00:03:29,705 --> 00:03:34,055
time analytics dashboards that kept
everything transparent together.

63
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:38,975
They formed a living learning system that
evolved with users, not despite them.

64
00:03:39,475 --> 00:03:43,075
If I had to summarize what really made
this work, it's these four principles.

65
00:03:43,435 --> 00:03:47,335
First, modularity build
independent service pieces that

66
00:03:47,335 --> 00:03:49,045
grow without breaking each other.

67
00:03:49,525 --> 00:03:52,855
Analytics first, that is
measure everything from day one.

68
00:03:53,185 --> 00:03:56,305
Third, scalability, assume
success and design for it.

69
00:03:56,394 --> 00:04:00,600
And fourth and finally user-centric
development because tools fail when

70
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,075
people aren't part of the build process.

71
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,464
Here are a few lessons that stuck with us.

72
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:05,935
Start with user behavior.

73
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,904
Don't just assume,
invest in microservices.

74
00:04:08,904 --> 00:04:13,795
You'll unlock flexibility without even
replatforming and make data visible.

75
00:04:13,914 --> 00:04:17,094
Real time dashboards create
accountability and momentum.

76
00:04:17,604 --> 00:04:21,235
These lessons are universal,
no matter your tech stack.

77
00:04:21,735 --> 00:04:25,035
If you're wondering how to get started,
here's the roadmap that we used.

78
00:04:25,575 --> 00:04:27,135
Assess where you are today.

79
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:29,265
Lay the foundation with analytics.

80
00:04:29,565 --> 00:04:32,235
Add intelligence with
JavaScript powered features.

81
00:04:32,595 --> 00:04:36,255
Optimize based on feedback, then
scale across the organization.

82
00:04:36,555 --> 00:04:40,275
It's a repeatable, proven approach,
not just a one-off success story.

83
00:04:40,775 --> 00:04:41,645
Let's wrap it up.

84
00:04:41,794 --> 00:04:44,284
First, embed, analytics and everywhere.

85
00:04:44,705 --> 00:04:48,844
Second, leverage JavaScript to make
systems adaptive and intelligent.

86
00:04:49,054 --> 00:04:52,114
Third, focus on measurable
outcomes that prove ROI.

87
00:04:52,114 --> 00:04:56,284
And finally, build modular, scalable
architectures that evolve with

88
00:04:56,284 --> 00:04:59,520
your business, and that's how we
transform knowledge into action.

89
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,820
Thank you so much for joining me today.

90
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,230
I hope this session sparks ideas on how
you can make your own knowledge systems

91
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,180
more intelligent and human centered.

92
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,969
You can find me on call 42 or LinkedIn,
and I'd love to continue the conversation.

93
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:13,960
Thanks all.

94
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:14,560
Bye.
