1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,070
Good morning, good afternoon,
good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,420
I'm Kumar End from Chicago, Illinois USA.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,880
First of all, thank you for investing
your time to join this conversation

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,640
with me here at conference 42.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,810
The topic of this conversation is beyond
production, how generative AI is reshaping

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,420
the future of a smart manufacturing.

7
00:00:28,755 --> 00:00:33,405
Over the past decade, we have
heard the worst industry 4.0 and

8
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:38,625
artificial intelligence so often that
the risk sounding like yesterday's

9
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:43,815
news, yet something fundamentally
new is happening right now.

10
00:00:44,775 --> 00:00:49,455
Generative AI is moving us beyond
prediction and dashboards into

11
00:00:49,455 --> 00:00:54,015
a world where machines create
new designs, new workflows, even

12
00:00:54,015 --> 00:00:56,115
new business models every day.

13
00:00:58,004 --> 00:01:00,214
This talk is not a technical deep dive.

14
00:01:00,934 --> 00:01:06,484
Instead, I want to paint a clear
business picture, why generative AI

15
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:13,054
matters, what results are already being
achieved, what challenges you must

16
00:01:13,054 --> 00:01:20,494
anticipate, and how to get started
without ing day-to-day presence by

17
00:01:20,494 --> 00:01:22,294
the end of the next half an hour.

18
00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:26,809
You will have a tested framework
you can take back to your team.

19
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:34,309
Let us begin with the outcomes that
matters most and that make executives and

20
00:01:34,309 --> 00:01:42,019
shareholders sit up and listen when the
board asks why Now, why generative ai?

21
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,779
There are some numbers that becomes
important and which cannot be ignored.

22
00:01:49,624 --> 00:01:54,365
Almost 40% sort of product
development timelines is achieved

23
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,975
at an aerospace supplier.

24
00:01:56,975 --> 00:01:58,865
We studied digital parts.

25
00:01:58,865 --> 00:02:02,524
Once took almost 18 months
from concept to certification.

26
00:02:03,994 --> 00:02:08,455
After embedding generative design,
generative AI design, that cycle

27
00:02:08,455 --> 00:02:10,195
failed to almost 11 months.

28
00:02:10,855 --> 00:02:16,285
And in another case, it was almost nine
months while still meeting FAAA standards.

29
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:23,125
Almost 35% improvement has been seen
in overall equipment efficiency.

30
00:02:24,955 --> 00:02:31,165
A consumer package goes CPJ, planned to
use a generative AI scheduling agent.

31
00:02:31,555 --> 00:02:39,985
That sequence sqs hour by hour and planned
downtime drop by roughly a third, and

32
00:02:40,015 --> 00:02:42,325
overtime costs fell right alongside it.

33
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:50,305
Almost 40 per 42, 40 to 42% lift in
successful innovations have been seen.

34
00:02:51,655 --> 00:02:54,805
Think of this as an
idea to impact velocity.

35
00:02:55,645 --> 00:03:01,075
A tier one auto supplier did not
merely brainstorm more concepts.

36
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:05,395
They commercialized more of them
because generative as simulation

37
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:10,045
flagged and factor ability issues
before the first prototype.

38
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,930
These gains are not edge cases.

39
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,290
In meta-analysis across more than
60 plants on three continents, we

40
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,150
see similar order of magnitude.

41
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,370
The takeaway, generative AI
turns marginal, kaizen gains

42
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,980
into step change performance.

43
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,110
Two, appreciate why
the gains are so large.

44
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,020
Plus, compare conventional
AI and generative ai.

45
00:03:40,105 --> 00:03:44,605
Conventional or traditional AI works
with the boundaries of past data.

46
00:03:44,935 --> 00:03:48,565
It forecasts outcomes
based on historical trends.

47
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:51,565
It is predictive and reactive in nature.

48
00:03:53,575 --> 00:03:59,470
However, genetic AI, on the other
hand, explores what could be.

49
00:04:00,385 --> 00:04:02,635
It models multiple alternative features.

50
00:04:02,905 --> 00:04:06,805
It synthesizes novel solutions
and a number of them.

51
00:04:08,035 --> 00:04:12,745
In manufacturing, this means
designing a new process, a new

52
00:04:12,745 --> 00:04:17,924
product configuration or even a new
materials before a problem arises.

53
00:04:18,944 --> 00:04:19,995
That's for illustration.

54
00:04:20,985 --> 00:04:27,405
A predictive model wants that a press
break is likely to fail in next 24 hours.

55
00:04:28,155 --> 00:04:29,625
That is valuable information.

56
00:04:32,235 --> 00:04:33,765
A generative model asks.

57
00:04:34,094 --> 00:04:39,284
What new process or press break
configuration would boost throughput

58
00:04:39,344 --> 00:04:44,474
by 20% and minimize maintenance
events in the first place.

59
00:04:45,674 --> 00:04:51,030
Then it produces a 3D Toolpath while you
can send a straight to your CAM system.

60
00:04:53,804 --> 00:05:00,464
In short, generative AI collapses the
gap between analysis and creation, and

61
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:02,684
that is game changing for manufacturing.

62
00:05:03,434 --> 00:05:03,885
Environ.

63
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:08,084
Now let's take this to production floor.

64
00:05:09,914 --> 00:05:12,495
Let's zoom into three day-to-day benefits.

65
00:05:12,674 --> 00:05:19,784
Every plant manager cares about number
one, eliminating the bottling, realtime

66
00:05:19,784 --> 00:05:25,574
layout engines, EST sensors, feed,
and automatically surfaces between

67
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:31,840
metal flow, canon position, and even
a MR that is autonomous mobile robot.

68
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,060
Routes.

69
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,820
Plants report almost 30% fewer
micro stops, and a visible

70
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,760
is smoothing off at times.

71
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:48,540
Number two is cutting
energy by almost 20 to 25%.

72
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,995
A European glass manufacturer
used a generative AI energy

73
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,420
optimizer that predicted furnace,
thermal inertia, hours in advance.

74
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:04,275
Power drawn now rises and falls
with the heartbeat of demand rather

75
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:10,155
than staying flat out a savings
of almost 2 million euros annually

76
00:06:10,365 --> 00:06:12,735
and a happier ESG scorecard.

77
00:06:14,835 --> 00:06:19,605
A third and most important aspect
is hours, not weeks in changeovers.

78
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:23,195
That's quick changeovers
between processes or operations.

79
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,099
During Covid, one electronics line
needed to swap from automotive

80
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:30,740
sensors to medical ventilator boards.

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,650
Historically, that would have been
at least 14 to 15 day revalidation

82
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:42,409
Generative VA process planner
produced new SMT recipes overnight

83
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,469
Fast pass yield was
97% the next afternoon.

84
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,099
Individually, each metric is impressive.

85
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,360
Together.

86
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,880
They create an operational operations.

87
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:02,360
Flywheel throughput funds
more AI plots or pilots, which

88
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,390
uncover more savings and so on.

89
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,120
Manufacturing strength means very
little without a robust supply chain.

90
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,940
There is some example where
generative AI science, knowing

91
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:21,140
about disruptions in advance, for
example, by blending weather feeds.

92
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:26,599
For traffic, APAs and supplier
health indicators, the model can

93
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:33,559
flag the material shortage week, two
weeks, or even a month in advance.

94
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:39,059
Prompting, preemptive action that can
be taken to streamline or smooth in

95
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:47,099
the supply chain process, identifying
alternative vendor or supplier instead

96
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,960
of a static approved vendor list.

97
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:55,409
The generative AI dynamically compiles
and risk scores, new suppliers worldwide.

98
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:56,520
Complete.

99
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,180
Complete those with the compliance
documents that can be clicked through.

100
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,620
Last but not least,
logistics auto rerouting.

101
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:10,930
There is a possibility that
traffic is closed or there is a

102
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,330
closed place or some accidents.

103
00:08:14,765 --> 00:08:19,719
The AI agent rerouted or optimizes
the routes reax containers by

104
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:25,299
cube key utilizations and reissues
updated to ETS to customers.

105
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:28,510
This all happens before
a human planners logging.

106
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:34,569
Ultimate result is this, all
pivot happens in our not in weeks.

107
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:39,419
In a world where a stuck container
can cost billions of dollars,

108
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,030
that agility is priceless.

109
00:08:43,454 --> 00:08:46,064
The scholars and practitioners
are converging fast.

110
00:08:46,905 --> 00:08:48,824
Let's picture a simple batch out here.

111
00:08:50,474 --> 00:08:53,685
Research publications
on one axis and industry

112
00:08:53,685 --> 00:08:55,545
implementations on the other axis.

113
00:08:56,474 --> 00:09:02,025
Research publications almost tripled
from 2023 to 2024, and during

114
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:05,805
the same timeframe, pilot project
implementations nearly doubled.

115
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,265
How has this happened?

116
00:09:09,045 --> 00:09:13,905
This is simply because simulation
to software friction is falling, and

117
00:09:13,905 --> 00:09:15,345
there are three main reasons for that.

118
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:21,435
Number one, foundation models trained
are trained on massive engineering.

119
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:25,605
Data sets are now available
and accessible via APIs.

120
00:09:27,705 --> 00:09:32,295
Number two, industrial iot maturity
finally provides the volume and

121
00:09:32,295 --> 00:09:34,575
velocity of data generative systems.

122
00:09:36,795 --> 00:09:44,025
Last but not least, cloud costs are
sliding, constantly making per flow

123
00:09:44,415 --> 00:09:46,785
scale, training economically viable.

124
00:09:47,985 --> 00:09:52,455
The bottom line is sandbox phases
over and we are in the mainstream

125
00:09:52,455 --> 00:09:55,065
adoption phase, and late movers risk.

126
00:09:55,065 --> 00:09:57,285
A structural disadvantages.

127
00:09:58,605 --> 00:10:02,750
The next question is what separates
the leaders from the laggards?

128
00:10:03,945 --> 00:10:04,545
Step four.

129
00:10:04,755 --> 00:10:05,955
Typical behaviors.

130
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:10,515
Number one, leisure focus
on high value use cases.

131
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:15,964
Leaders start with one pain
point worth, multimillions, not

132
00:10:15,964 --> 00:10:17,854
a skunk works science project.

133
00:10:19,564 --> 00:10:23,884
Convergence of informants and
technology team and operations team.

134
00:10:25,894 --> 00:10:30,519
In such scenario they get the CI and the
plant engineers in the same room early.

135
00:10:31,534 --> 00:10:37,114
So MES or manufacturing execution
system data meets cloud AI without

136
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:38,884
endless middleware battles.

137
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:47,764
Third objective and transparent KPIs
like overall equipment deficiency,

138
00:10:47,764 --> 00:10:53,464
OE scrap and energy KPIs are
published daily on shared dashboards.

139
00:10:54,064 --> 00:10:57,004
Turning an anecdote into accountability.

140
00:10:58,684 --> 00:11:01,504
Last but not least,
playbook driven scaling.

141
00:11:02,104 --> 00:11:06,754
Once one line works, they replicate
the same tech stack, same change

142
00:11:06,754 --> 00:11:11,164
management rituals across plants,
regions, and business units.

143
00:11:12,514 --> 00:11:13,389
So what is the payoff?

144
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:20,914
At least 35% faster time to market
and 42% higher innovation hit

145
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:26,284
rates versus peers sustained over
a five year, five year horizon.

146
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:32,119
So are these implementations
smooth without any challenges?

147
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:32,599
No.

148
00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:34,909
Let's not sugarcoat the hurdles.

149
00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:40,009
Then you will generally
face three big challenges.

150
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:44,929
At the top of the list is
data quality and governance.

151
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:51,139
Governance main gap will be missing
sensors on your legacy equipment.

152
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,979
There is another possible
noise that is PLC.

153
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:59,209
Time stamps are out of sync, so
that data needs to be corrected.

154
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,099
Ski semantics here is, there are
10 ways to spell the part IDs.

155
00:12:04,729 --> 00:12:06,259
Each company has different way.

156
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:10,489
Each team may have different way
of work, spelling or naming apart,

157
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:15,019
so this needs to be solved with
the modern data fabric layer and a

158
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:17,029
single owner for data towards it.

159
00:12:19,099 --> 00:12:21,979
Second biggest to challenge
is security and IP protection.

160
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:26,749
Generative models may
ingest CRL process knowhow.

161
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:32,209
Without a strict access controls
and federated learning options,

162
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:34,759
you risk leaking trade secrets.

163
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:37,189
Zero.

164
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:43,249
Trust architecture and secure model
incls are must have not a nice to have

165
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,829
in any genetic AI implementations.

166
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:53,179
Last but not least, algorithmic
bias and model shift any historical

167
00:12:53,179 --> 00:13:00,919
data set Under underrepresents new
recyclable design, the AI may prefer

168
00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:06,314
old plastics sabotaging sustainability
targets continuous monitoring

169
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:09,409
and periodic model code reviews.

170
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:11,089
Keep the system honest.

171
00:13:12,484 --> 00:13:18,604
Companies that invest in these foundations
upfront, consistently capture higher

172
00:13:18,604 --> 00:13:22,124
ROI and face fewer boardroom surprises.

173
00:13:23,984 --> 00:13:28,974
Next million dollar question is what is
the return on investment and which is most

174
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,369
important on any project implementation?

175
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,915
Return on investment
is not just impressive.

176
00:13:34,974 --> 00:13:37,909
It is exponential in this
kind of implementation.

177
00:13:39,104 --> 00:13:43,394
In the first three months, companies
invest in a strategy and system set up.

178
00:13:44,564 --> 00:13:49,514
By month four to five, they begin
saying miserable process improvements.

179
00:13:50,684 --> 00:13:56,564
By month seven to eight, they typically
reach some kind of breakeven, and by

180
00:13:56,564 --> 00:14:01,389
end of the first year, many companies
report a hundred percent plus ROI

181
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:05,829
without with continuous compounding,
as the system learns and evolves.

182
00:14:06,564 --> 00:14:11,814
This is intelligent automation that pays
for itself quickly and continuously.

183
00:14:13,224 --> 00:14:16,224
Now, let's talk about some
implementation approaches, to

184
00:14:16,224 --> 00:14:22,314
achieve successful implementation,
there are four phase playbook that

185
00:14:22,314 --> 00:14:24,555
can be implemented or utilized.

186
00:14:25,305 --> 00:14:29,494
A step one is our phase one is assessment
process, which can be between two to

187
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:34,144
four weeks or six weeks, depending
on the nature of an implementation.

188
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:40,294
In this process, map data sets rank
pain points by value and feasibility

189
00:14:40,774 --> 00:14:42,994
and secure leadership sponsorship.

190
00:14:44,404 --> 00:14:49,834
Phase two is data preparation, which
can be between six to eight weeks in

191
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:57,384
this phase, clean level and integrate
sensors manufacturing, SY execution

192
00:14:57,384 --> 00:15:03,054
systems, ERPO, that is enterprise source
planning and supplier data into common.

193
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:05,109
Data warehouse.

194
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:12,519
Next phase is pilot deployment,
which can last for eight last

195
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:15,879
between eight to 12 weeks run.

196
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:21,579
One contained use case for high high,
highly high important business process.

197
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,420
For example, generative is generative.

198
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,060
AI is scheduling on a
single packaging line.

199
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,230
With crystal clear success
criteria and measurable KPIs.

200
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:38,380
Fourth phases is scaling,
which is ongoing flow.

201
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:43,979
The stack and new use cases
are basically identified.

202
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,180
Institute AIOps for continuous monitoring.

203
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:54,449
This needs to be then needs to be put
some guardrails, which are basically

204
00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:59,599
change management training, fortnightly
stakeholders demos and rollback plan.

205
00:16:00,979 --> 00:16:06,439
You hopefully never use need to use, but
in case you have to, that comes handy.

206
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:10,279
Let's talk about the next steps.

207
00:16:10,954 --> 00:16:16,060
If you remember nothing else from
this discussion or for some reason.

208
00:16:17,124 --> 00:16:18,354
Take these three action.

209
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,605
Back to the team.

210
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:27,615
Number one, conduct a readiness assessment
in this assessment or audit data,

211
00:16:27,615 --> 00:16:30,045
talent, culture are to be included.

212
00:16:32,175 --> 00:16:38,385
The gaps are need to be identified and
what are quick wins are hiding in plain

213
00:16:38,385 --> 00:16:39,885
sight that needs to be identified.

214
00:16:41,595 --> 00:16:44,925
Number two is basically
select a lighthouse pilot.

215
00:16:45,465 --> 00:16:50,215
That is the key business process where
it can be implemented, which is of high

216
00:16:50,215 --> 00:16:52,465
value and low political resistance.

217
00:16:53,785 --> 00:16:58,555
Let's think about packaging line, not the
company's flagship process on day one,

218
00:17:01,045 --> 00:17:05,125
and then draft a 12 month
roadmap that links milestones to

219
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,974
financial KPIs and ESG targets.

220
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:16,540
Share it widely and publicly on company
dashboards which basically talks about

221
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,150
transparency and that creates momentum.

222
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,010
You start a smart major
ruthlessly scale fast.

223
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,270
That is the recipe for durable
transformation implementation.

224
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,260
I'd like to thank you for your attention
and engagement during this discussion.

225
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,170
We are at an infection point.

226
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:43,379
Where factories are no longer constrained
by yesterday's data, but powered by

227
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:48,570
tomorrow's possibilities, those who
act now will set the pace for the

228
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,430
next era of industrial leadership.

229
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,310
I look forward to your questions
and to discussing how we can partner

230
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,879
on your own generative AI journey.

231
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,425
Thank you very much.
