00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,100
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,050
My name is Ravi Chandra,
principal salesforce developer

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,950
and architect at Temple V Capital.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,110
Today, I am excited to share
our journey of transforming the

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,270
borrower experience through a
responsive loan application portal.

6
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:17,809
This isn't just about improving
functionality, but creating an

7
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:21,110
entirely new digital landscape
that empowers borrower.

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,880
Let's dive into how we tackle
legacy challenges and design a

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,040
revolutionary borrower centric solution.

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,550
The need for change.

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,260
We started this transformation
journey by recognizing the critical

12
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,260
pain points in our legacy systems.

13
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,690
First, we faced inconsistent
performance that frustrated users

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,880
and led to lower conversion rates.

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,380
Next, there was a glaring gap in
mobile accessibility, a catastrophic

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,720
60 percent abatement rate among mobile
users on our digitally native customers.

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,430
Lastly, our outdated technology
infrastructure created complex

18
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,034
workflows that made the loan
application process much more difficult.

19
00:00:59,275 --> 00:01:00,055
Pretty complex.

20
00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:05,565
These challenges were our call of
action for the change, crafting

21
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:07,145
a seamless digital experience.

22
00:01:07,645 --> 00:01:09,565
Our solution focused on three pillars.

23
00:01:09,835 --> 00:01:15,185
First, an adaptive user interface ensured
intuitive navigation across devices,

24
00:01:15,705 --> 00:01:19,955
making the portal equally effective on
mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

25
00:01:20,475 --> 00:01:24,355
Second, we streamlined the application
process with intelligent document

26
00:01:24,365 --> 00:01:29,035
management using MuleSoft IDP
tool and secure e signatures.

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,920
Slashing processing time.

28
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,870
Lastly, we introduced a comprehensive
loan management hub, a real time

29
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:40,050
dashboard offering borrowers complete
visibility and control of their loans.

30
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:45,480
Together, this innovative, this innovation
transformed the borrower journey

31
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,780
into a seamless digital experience.

32
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,089
Measuring success, the
results have been remarkable.

33
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:57,160
We accelerated processing efficiency by
30%, cutting the average application time

34
00:01:57,179 --> 00:02:00,120
in half from 25 minutes to just under 15.

35
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:03,380
Support call volumes dropped by 40%.

36
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,350
Reflecting a more reliable and user
friendly systems, perhaps most rewarding

37
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:14,600
was the 35 percent increase in customer
satisfaction scores, demonstrating the

38
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,650
value of a borrower focused approach.

39
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,729
These metrics show the power of
aligning technology with user needs.

40
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:24,710
Coming on to design
principles and technologies.

41
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,070
Our design principles were
rooted in three key elements.

42
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,590
A mobile first approach ensured responsive
across all devices, accommodating

43
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,440
the growing mobile user base.

44
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,769
By leveraging user centric
design, we built an interface that

45
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,189
dynamically adopts user preferences.

46
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:51,150
Finally, advanced technologies including
cloud infrastructure, robust APIs, and

47
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,870
multi factor authentication formed the
backbone of this innovative portal.

48
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,960
This strategic combination was
essential for delivering A secure

49
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,610
and scalable borrower experience.

50
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,950
Lessons learned.

51
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,450
Optimizing for user engagement.

learned valuable lessons.

53
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,000
First, data driven
insights were important.

54
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,509
Those allowed us to optimize the
portal based on the real user behavior.

55
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,780
Next, clear and concise communication.

56
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:24,955
including real time updates,
built borrower confidence, and

57
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:26,455
reduced application errors.

58
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:31,065
Finally, establishing a continuous
feedback loop ensured the portal

59
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:33,434
evolved with borrower expectation.

60
00:03:34,055 --> 00:03:38,275
These lessons are not just milestones,
but stepping stones for future innovation.

61
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:41,154
Beyond the portal, future innovations.

62
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:46,420
Looking ahead, we are excited to explore
Three transformative innovations.

63
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,410
First, intelligent AI powered chatbot
will provide 24 by 7 personalized

64
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,420
support, guiding borrowers through
the most complex workflows.

65
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:02,459
Second, voice activated loan application
will enhance accessibility, offering

66
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,990
natural language interactions.

67
00:04:04,435 --> 00:04:09,705
Finally, integrating blockchain
technology will revolutionize transparency

68
00:04:09,815 --> 00:04:15,344
and security, creating immutable
loan records while reducing fraud.

69
00:04:15,825 --> 00:04:20,894
These innovations promise to take
borrower experience to the next level.

70
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,304
The power of modern approach.

71
00:04:23,824 --> 00:04:26,734

We have streamlined workflows,
cutting processing time up to by 70%.

73
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:36,089
Borrower experience has improved
significantly, driving a 40

74
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:38,009
percent increase in loan approvals.

75
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:43,339
Operational costs were reduced
by 50%, enhancing our overall

76
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:45,469
efficiency and brand perception.

77
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:50,789
Most importantly, we have expanded
financial accessibility, empowering

78
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:53,229
underserved population, and creating.

79
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,259
