1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,350
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,560
My name is Lata Putar Laka,
and I'm currently working as a

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,620
senior, a and developer at the
US Food and Drug Administration.

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,490
I bring 18 years of experience in the
financial and healthcare industries.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,450
Having worked extensively as a
QA automation architect, I have a

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,190
strong background in automation.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,290
Quality assurance and
process optimization.

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,490
Today I focus on leveraging low-code
platforms to accelerate application

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,180
development, streamline workflows,
and deliver scalable solutions

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,770
that meet complex business needs.

11
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,030
My deep industry knowledge, combined
with low-code expertise, allows me

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,960
to build efficient, compliant and
user-friendly applications that drive

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,480
innovation and operational experience.

14
00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:44,355
I am passionate about creating scalable
applications using visual development

15
00:00:44,355 --> 00:00:49,125
tools, enabling me to rapidly deliver
powerful solutions that bridge the gap

16
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,464
between business needs and technology.

17
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,245
By minimizing traditional
coding, I help accelerate project

18
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:58,635
delivery, improve collaboration,
and drive digital transformation.

19
00:00:58,964 --> 00:01:03,045
I enjoy turning complex problems
into simple automated workflows that

20
00:01:03,045 --> 00:01:05,474
empower teams and enhance productivity.

21
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:09,465
I am excited to take you through
a journey of transformation from

22
00:01:09,465 --> 00:01:11,145
the fragmented manual process.

23
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,750
That have long slowed down clinical
research to a future where automation

24
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,590
and low-code platform drive
agility, precision, and innovation.

25
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,640
We are going to explore how modern
clinical research operations can

26
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,210
evolve through smart platform
engineering, leveraging low-code

27
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,289
technologies and automation to
remove inefficiencies, reduce human

28
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:34,705
error, and ultimately accelerate the
delivery of medical breakthrough.

29
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,900
Our goal is not only improve research
outcomes, but to positively impact

30
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,980
patient care, faster, smarter,
and with greater reliability.

31
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,300
Let's dive in.

32
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,850
To understand why automation and low-code
platforms are so critical, we first

33
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,420
need to acknowledge the challenges that
currently plague clinical research.

34
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,140
Despite being the engine of
medical innovation, clinical

35
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,740
research operations are still
bogged down by three major issues.

36
00:02:01,085 --> 00:02:03,304
First, there's paperwork overload.

37
00:02:03,634 --> 00:02:06,965
Many teams still rely on paper
forms, manual data entry,

38
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:08,375
and physical documentation.

39
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:13,415
This creates bottlenecks, increase the
risk of human error, and add significant

40
00:02:13,415 --> 00:02:15,935
time and cost to every phase of research.

41
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:18,275
Second, regulatory complexity.

42
00:02:18,695 --> 00:02:24,035
Navigating complaints, requirements across
ethics boards, government agencies, and

43
00:02:24,035 --> 00:02:28,180
institutional review boards is not only
time consuming, but resource intensive.

44
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:33,545
It creates a massive administration burden
that distracts from actual research.

45
00:02:33,845 --> 00:02:36,335
And finally, fragmented data systems.

46
00:02:36,575 --> 00:02:40,925
Researchers are constantly switching
between siloed systems, EHRs,

47
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:44,555
lab systems, trial management
platforms just to reconcile data.

48
00:02:44,855 --> 00:02:48,155
Instead of analyzing results,
they are stuck performing tedious

49
00:02:48,155 --> 00:02:52,715
data integration task at the,
and the image here tells a story.

50
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,660
Brilliant minds are stuck under
piles of administrative work

51
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,460
when they should be innovating.

52
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,550
This is the reality we aim to transform.

53
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,590
Even though research teams are highly
skilled and deeply committed to

54
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:11,030
advancing science, the reality is
they are spending far too much time on

55
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,190
administrative work instead of research.

56
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:16,175
Let me share some numbers that
illustrate the challenges.

57
00:03:16,535 --> 00:03:20,675
60% of research coordinators
time is consumed by documentation

58
00:03:20,975 --> 00:03:22,205
and manual data entry.

59
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:26,915
That time they could be spending
engaging with patients or focusing

60
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:32,135
on trial execution, but instead they
are managing forms, spreadsheets,

61
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:32,885
and disconnected systems.

62
00:03:33,385 --> 00:03:38,245
On average, a researcher has to log
into three to five different systems

63
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:42,835
each day just to complete core task
that adds unnecessary complexity,

64
00:03:43,075 --> 00:03:46,675
drains time, and increases the
chance of data inconsistencies,

65
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:48,685
and the impact is significant.

66
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:53,875
25% of clinical trials are delayed not
because of scientific barriers, but

67
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,495
due to the administrative bottlenecks.

68
00:03:55,855 --> 00:03:56,425
That's one.

69
00:03:56,425 --> 00:04:00,355
In our four trials, potentially
life-saving treatments slowed

70
00:04:00,355 --> 00:04:02,485
down by outdated workflows.

71
00:04:02,995 --> 00:04:05,485
These inefficiencies are
more than frustrating.

72
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,845
They directly delay patient's
access to new therapies.

73
00:04:09,295 --> 00:04:14,095
Clearly, it's time to reimagine the
way research workflows are designed and

74
00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:17,635
executed, and that's where automation
and low-code platforms come in.

75
00:04:18,135 --> 00:04:21,885
Now that we have seen the challenges,
let's talk about our vision.

76
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,500
We believe clinical research
platforms should no longer be

77
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,890
a source of frustration, but
instead a source of empowerment.

78
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,030
Our goal is to build platforms
that are modular, automated, and

79
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,710
integrated modular so that they can
evolve with research needs, adapting

80
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,300
without requiring full results.

81
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,170
Automated to remove repetitive
to manual task, freeing up

82
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,150
researchers to focus on the science.

83
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:50,130
And integrated so that data flow
seamlessly across systems, reducing

84
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,050
friction and improving accuracy.

85
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,640
Ultimately, we want researchers to
spend less time wrestling with tools

86
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,780
and more time doing what they do
best, innovating, experimenting, and

87
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,770
pushing the boundaries of science.

88
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,940
Technology should handle
complexity behind the scenes.

89
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,710
That's the heart of our approach, using
smart automation and low-code platforms

90
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,540
to make the heart vision a reality.

91
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,540
We are not just solving
human efficiencies, we are

92
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,400
accelerating medical progress.

93
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,760
Now let's talk about how we can
bring this vision to life, and

94
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,980
that's through low-code platforms.

95
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,750
Low code is a game changer because
it allows research organizations

96
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,500
to rapidly build and evolve
applications without requiring

97
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,120
deep software development skills.

98
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,460
There are three powerful benefits.

99
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,440
One rapid prototyping.

100
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,210
Research teams can test and deploy
new workflows in days, not months.

101
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,210
This speed means we can spend faster than.

102
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,640
New to new trial needs, regulatory
changes or process improvements without

103
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,010
wasting for traditional IT talent.

104
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,080
Second is the customizability.

105
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,170
No two clinical trails are exactly alike.

106
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:04,075
Low-code platforms allow for
flexible configurations, so each

107
00:06:04,075 --> 00:06:07,255
workflow can be tailored to the
unique needs of the study without

108
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:08,845
rebuilding everything from scratch.

109
00:06:09,445 --> 00:06:14,725
Third and last, accessibility, perhaps
most importantly, low-code makes

110
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:16,885
digital transformation more inclusive.

111
00:06:17,395 --> 00:06:21,715
Even non-technical stakeholders like
clinical coordinators, regulatory

112
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:25,210
leads, can take part in designing
workflows that meet their day-to-day.

113
00:06:25,835 --> 00:06:26,795
Operational needs.

114
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:32,855
So in essence, local enables smarter,
faster, and more collaborative innovation,

115
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:38,045
and it's one of the most effective ways to
remove friction from research operations.

116
00:06:38,545 --> 00:06:41,485
This case study really brings
a transformation to life.

117
00:06:42,475 --> 00:06:46,735
Let's start with the challenges before
implementation, which are all too

118
00:06:46,735 --> 00:06:48,895
familiar across many research teams.

119
00:06:49,515 --> 00:06:52,995
The first one is a manual data
entry meant that staff were

120
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:56,565
entering patient information into
spreadsheets, a slow error from process

121
00:06:56,565 --> 00:06:58,395
that created data about clinics.

122
00:06:58,995 --> 00:07:03,495
Startup delays occurred because trial
immunization depended on fragmented

123
00:07:03,495 --> 00:07:08,025
systems and manual approvals offered
dragging timelines out of weeks.

124
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,675
And complaints are nightmares where
audits require weeks of staff time

125
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:17,415
to manually gather, validate, and
compile documentation for regulators.

126
00:07:17,475 --> 00:07:23,065
Now look at the impact after implementing
low-code automation, electronic

127
00:07:23,065 --> 00:07:27,595
data capture replaced manual forms
with automated systems, improving

128
00:07:27,595 --> 00:07:29,635
data accuracy and reducing delays.

129
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:31,435
Streamlined startup.

130
00:07:31,525 --> 00:07:33,835
Automated workflows
meant trial minimization.

131
00:07:33,835 --> 00:07:38,425
Time dropped from weeks to just pace,
and finally, the continuous complaints.

132
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:42,445
With real-time monitoring and
built-in audit trials, staff could

133
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:46,615
meet regulatory requirements without
the chaos and last minute scrambles.

134
00:07:46,885 --> 00:07:49,345
This shift didn't just improve efficiency.

135
00:07:49,555 --> 00:07:53,035
It fundamentally changed how the
team worked, enabling them to

136
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,610
move faster with few errors and
more confidence in compliance.

137
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,100
Now let's take a look at how
this solution comes together.

138
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,900
From a technical perspective, we have
built a modular platform architecture

139
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,670
where each component is designed to
work independently at, seamlessly

140
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,320
integrates with the rest of the system.

141
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,420
First, we have data capture.

142
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,140
This is where clinical data enters
the system either through electronic

143
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,630
forms, APIs, or direct system input.

144
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,450
It ensures accuracy right from the start.

145
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:28,849
The integration engine connects diverse
tools like EHRs, lab systems, and third

146
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:31,340
party software into a unified workflow.

147
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,190
This eliminates the
friction of siloed systems.

148
00:08:34,609 --> 00:08:39,200
With workflow automation, we streamline
routine tasks like documenting,

149
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,149
routing, notifications and approval
ing, reducing human intervention,

150
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,470
and speeding up timelines.

151
00:08:46,264 --> 00:08:47,135
Complaints man.

152
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:51,694
Monitoring is a built in, so audits and
checks can be done in real time, and

153
00:08:51,694 --> 00:08:55,925
we maintain a clear audit trial without
needing extra effort from the team.

154
00:08:56,254 --> 00:09:01,204
Finally, the analytics dashboard gives
stakeholders clear visibility into

155
00:09:01,204 --> 00:09:05,655
performance, bottlenecks and trends,
allowing for faster data-driven decisions.

156
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,280
The key takeaway here is flexibility.

157
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:13,650
Each component is independently
deployable, meaning we can scale or adapt

158
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:18,330
to changing regulatory and clinical needs
without overhauling the entire system.

159
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,280
This slide highlights one of
the most powerful shifts enabled

160
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,390
by our platform, moving from
periodic to continuous compliance.

161
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,500
Traditionally, complaints relies
on scheduled audits, which are

162
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,910
reactive and time consuming.

163
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,960
But with automation, we
take a proactive approach.

164
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,560
Real time validation rules
captures inconsistencies as

165
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,610
data is entered, preventing
errors before they can snowball.

166
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:49,220
Automated crosschecks can run behind the
scenes continuously, comparing data across

167
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,920
systems to flag discrepancies early.

168
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:57,050
Comprehensive audit tile trials are
automatically generated, sharing every

169
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:02,390
system interaction, and making it easy
to trace what happened, when and by whom.

170
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,350
And we have automated complaints
reporting, which can instantly

171
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,730
produce regulatory documents.

172

Align platform features with
real on the ground needs rather

186
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,430
than relying on assumptions.

187
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,140
When people heard and involved,
they more invested in success.

188
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,610
Change management.

189
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,030
Rolling out new technology
can disrupt workflows.

190
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,900
So structured training programs
and phase rollouts are essential.
