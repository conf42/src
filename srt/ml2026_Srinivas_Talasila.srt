1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,339
Speaker 30: Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:04,970
Welcome to Con 42 20 26.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,729
This is Riva.

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:13,580
I have 19 plus years of
information technology experience.

5
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:22,520
Worked with companies like at and
t, Adobe Systems, hp, and presently

6
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,530
I'm working with SAP America.

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,095
Today's topic is.

8
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:34,635
To discuss on a high level, what are the
challenges and key factors that needs

9
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:40,185
to be given a deep thought while moving
ML systems from experimental labs to

10
00:00:40,185 --> 00:00:46,545
production systems, and what are the
infrastructure challenges that needs

11
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:52,025
to be given a thought and considered
while planning phase with that quickly.

12
00:00:52,525 --> 00:00:54,085
Go through the agenda.

13
00:00:54,585 --> 00:01:00,815
Today's agenda would be to go on a high
level, what are all the key challenges?

14
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:07,205
We can talk more on challenges to help
us understand why this is important

15
00:01:07,205 --> 00:01:12,625
and what are the key factors that
needs to be considered to overcome

16
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:15,415
the production use case challenges.

17
00:01:15,915 --> 00:01:21,225
And we can also go over modernizing
infrastructure availability and why

18
00:01:21,225 --> 00:01:28,295
it is needed to have more scalability,
resilience, reliability, also

19
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:32,495
observability and security compliance
requirements for the production

20
00:01:32,495 --> 00:01:38,045
systems and available options that
needs to be looked in the market to

21
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:39,755
address some of those challenges.

22
00:01:40,255 --> 00:01:47,085
And IBM Cloud Soft Layer Foundation,
it has a good backend infrastructure

23
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:52,445
which gives us a good performance
metrics and resilient as well.

24
00:01:52,835 --> 00:01:59,135
So we can go, as an example, what
it gives us pillars of resilience.

25
00:01:59,635 --> 00:02:00,955
What are those like?

26
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:04,555
High availability, security, and
performance as previously mentioned,

27
00:02:04,615 --> 00:02:10,725
reliability, also scalability zone
deployments for high availability.

28
00:02:11,225 --> 00:02:19,385
And we can also talk about people and
process as this is a must need for

29
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:24,290
production systems where teams will
be cross-functional teams will be.

30
00:02:24,925 --> 00:02:34,885
Coordinating and using the systems for
use cases depending upon the use and what

31
00:02:34,885 --> 00:02:42,654
are the deployment patterns and how cloud
native approach will help us to maintain,

32
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:50,414
simplify the deployment patterns to
version maintenance and reproducibility.

33
00:02:50,914 --> 00:02:52,774
And for also the auditing.

34
00:02:52,834 --> 00:02:56,314
This is a comprehensive
requirement, which will help.

35
00:02:56,814 --> 00:02:59,154
And finally, we'll be
talking about key takeaways.

36
00:02:59,654 --> 00:03:07,954
Let's start talking about the challenges,
what we have from mowing ML systems from.

37
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:14,779
Pro experimental labs to production
systems and the key things in a

38
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:19,929
experimental labs where the data will
be pure and we will be more focusing on

39
00:03:19,929 --> 00:03:27,109
benchmarking the performance metrics,
use cases but in production systems,

40
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:32,059
there are a lot more challenges
because of the drift management.

41
00:03:32,765 --> 00:03:35,015
Use case scenarios varies.

42
00:03:35,584 --> 00:03:37,265
It's not always the same.

43
00:03:37,924 --> 00:03:42,915
And the scalability requirements
and latency comes into play.

44
00:03:42,944 --> 00:03:47,355
Performance metrics and
availability as well.

45
00:03:48,045 --> 00:03:53,125
That is the reason why, these are
the things that needs to be given

46
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,405
a deep thought while planning.

47
00:03:55,905 --> 00:04:01,185
A move of ML systems from experimental
labs to production systems.

48
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:04,635
These are the sum of the key comparisons.

49
00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:11,295
What we have from legacy systems and
current production demands and what modern

50
00:04:11,295 --> 00:04:19,345
platforms offers the modern platforms
is more towards cloud native approach.

51
00:04:19,975 --> 00:04:24,415
And in the market we have many
cloud providers, which does that,

52
00:04:25,135 --> 00:04:29,985
and cutting edge technologies and
with the integrations, all the

53
00:04:29,985 --> 00:04:35,895
reliability aspects, security aspects,
and also the monitoring alerting.

54
00:04:36,285 --> 00:04:41,555
Absorbability made easy with
the cutting edge cloud agnostic

55
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,865
or cloud native approaches.

56
00:04:44,365 --> 00:04:48,235
Now let's see about IBM Cloud Soft Player.

57
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:54,155
So this gives high performance, bare
metal and virtual compute options.

58
00:04:54,655 --> 00:05:01,280
Also, we have global availability
zones and IBM Cloud Soft Player network

59
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,025
backbone, optimized for larger dataset.

60
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:12,645
Data transfers, which is key aspect to
consider while moving to your production

61
00:05:12,975 --> 00:05:22,355
systems to overcome any bottlenecks on
throughput, iops, or it could be latency.

62
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:28,095
So IBM provides some of these
cutting edge technology options.

63
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,190
Which will help
productizing the ML systems.

64
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:37,260
Now, the what are the pillars
of resilient ML infrastructure?

65
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,200
The key pillars would
be high availability.

66
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:45,930
High availability, as we
discussed before on a high level.

67
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,360
While planning and designing phase, we
will have to think about the use case

68
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,070
scenarios like multi-zone deployments,
which cloud provider provides us

69
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:01,510
a zone features, which has their
presence across multiple zones and

70
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:08,350
offering its customers to deploy across
multiple zones with minimal latency.

71
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,900
And those benchmarks needs to be
looked at depending upon the use case.

72
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:19,680
That way, we have clear understanding
on what will be our latency

73
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,500
patterns, performance metrics, iVOS,

74
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,420
and this is mainly also
for disaster recovery.

75
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,310
When we have multi-channel deployments,
we will, it is good that we will

76
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,960
have another zone available.

77
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,750
And disaster recovery.

78
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,180
What in case everything goes down, right?

79
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,260
So a different site
from backup strategies.

80
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:47,340
There are, many a gap solutions
or you call it immutable backups.

81
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,360
These are the things that
needs to be given a thought.

82
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:57,140
While considering a disaster recovery,
that will minimize our recovery times.

83
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,915
And we should also consider which
cloud provider provides this as an

84
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:09,445
option in terms of the time to recover
should be minimal, and that should

85
00:07:09,445 --> 00:07:13,865
be, understood before designing
a disaster recovery planning.

86
00:07:14,365 --> 00:07:16,695
And security by design.

87
00:07:17,195 --> 00:07:18,545
Yeah, zero trust.

88
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:27,185
These are must in today's infrastructure,
as we are mostly leaning towards cloud

89
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:35,345
agnostic and cloud native and multi-cloud
adoptions being a top priorities for most

90
00:07:35,345 --> 00:07:38,455
of the organizations, the observability.

91
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:46,350
And security compliance are key metrics
for any organization, and we will have to

92
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:50,010
look into a cloud providers who does that?

93
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:59,110
Like who provides default blocks for
DDoS attacks or for ransomware attacks.

94
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,450
Those has to be thoroughly.

95
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:06,460
We've gone through while designing
this security by design and who

96
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,040
are all the players in that area

97
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,420
and the design of the production systems.

98
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:20,090
High availability architecture is a
must of our seamless activities and

99
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:27,570
for ensuring the s. Oh, we call four
nines or finance, whatever the numbers

100
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,960
are to meet those SLA Benchmarkings.

101
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,580
High availability architecture.

102
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,340
Architecture plays a critical role.

103
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:39,150
And the apps, what kind of flow?

104
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:45,060
Balancing distributed traffic across
Jones we are, we will be using and

105
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:50,670
if it is a, stateless serving server
models without a local space state.

106
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:59,295
Which will help us minimize our fail lines
and the availability will be much more

107
00:08:59,295 --> 00:09:02,855
higher and there should be a mechanism.

108
00:09:02,855 --> 00:09:08,285
We should also have fault tolerance
detection and take a preventative

109
00:09:08,285 --> 00:09:16,315
measures for failing over the systems to
available systems to solve the traffic.

110
00:09:16,815 --> 00:09:19,785
And health recovery is also a must.

111
00:09:20,295 --> 00:09:26,905
And in this model, we should cover
like what Monitoring, preventative

112
00:09:26,905 --> 00:09:34,945
measures, thresholds, setting up a
triggers for failovers or next step,

113
00:09:35,005 --> 00:09:40,555
the correctable action items to
recover and how do we fail back to.

114
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:44,010
These are the things that needs to
be considered for high availability

115
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:49,215
architecture to achieve a good
high level uptime of the systems.

116
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:52,415
And how do we sustain ML workloads?

117
00:09:52,445 --> 00:09:59,055
These are the, some of the, model linings
for the real case production ML systems.

118
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:04,505
De depending upon the types of the
workloads, we have each presenting unique

119
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:06,875
challenge for robust system designs.

120
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,195
Again, this will be on sorry.

121
00:10:09,385 --> 00:10:12,205
Again, this will be on
case to case design.

122
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:18,475
This has to be given and how do we
rate limits, for example, rate limits

123
00:10:18,505 --> 00:10:20,665
for unpredictable traffic spikes.

124
00:10:21,165 --> 00:10:24,345
That has to be clearly
defined and benchmarked.

125
00:10:24,735 --> 00:10:32,324
That way it doesn't affect
the other users traffic.

126
00:10:32,824 --> 00:10:36,935
If there is an unpredictable
traffic in one of the use case, it

127
00:10:36,935 --> 00:10:39,785
should not impact the other case.

128
00:10:39,844 --> 00:10:44,845
For that, real time serving rate limits,
all this will help come into your play.

129
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:49,864
It could be, or in the case of
DDoS attack as well, how do we

130
00:10:49,864 --> 00:10:51,544
limit, how do we predict that?

131
00:10:52,114 --> 00:10:57,784
How do we set alerts at what are
the limits that the traffic should

132
00:10:57,784 --> 00:11:02,514
be, blocked from a particular
source in a use case scenarios.

133
00:11:03,014 --> 00:11:06,594
So that is how we will be,
more looking into sustaining

134
00:11:07,094 --> 00:11:08,984
models for production systems.

135
00:11:09,484 --> 00:11:14,374
And this plays a vital role, zero
trust segmentation for ML systems.

136
00:11:14,824 --> 00:11:20,774
As we discussed in my previous slide,
discussions, security plays a vital role.

137
00:11:21,404 --> 00:11:26,424
And for this, it could be, customers
auditing purpose and the compliance

138
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:30,944
requirements has to be clearly
defined and well known in advance.

139
00:11:31,444 --> 00:11:37,644
And the drift management should be
there to ensure annoyingly something

140
00:11:37,644 --> 00:11:39,444
got changed on the infrastructure.

141
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:44,684
It could be rate limits, it could
be, allowed port listing, or it could

142
00:11:44,684 --> 00:11:49,499
be allowed software versionings,
or the release versionings.

143
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:52,239
So for all that, we can also make use of.

144
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:54,599
Cloud native approach.

145
00:11:55,099 --> 00:12:00,319
Most of the cloud public cloud providers
are providing this as a feature.

146
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:05,789
I think it's a paid feature depending
upon the use case scenario and

147
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:10,489
what kind of network design that
we choose for the ML systems.

148
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:13,729
That has to be, clearly given a thought.

149
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:17,479
What are the available
options and cloud providers?

150
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:24,499
Who provides these information and
available for usage, depending upon the

151
00:12:24,499 --> 00:12:31,899
test case scenarios, sign benchmarkings
SLAs, these can be considered and mainly

152
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,364
this is to, data set production and
training environment registrations.

153
00:12:36,394 --> 00:12:42,814
The QA there of the training of the
testing beds should be separate from the.

154
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:44,469
Quality checks.

155
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:48,249
And from the quality checks, the
producting system should be isolated,

156
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:54,069
where always the changes should
come from the lower environments

157
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:55,569
to the higher environments.

158
00:12:56,069 --> 00:13:01,079
Post testing, thoroughly testing,
and post security declarance.

159
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:05,539
And there should be a model
serving security, which is like

160
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:10,309
endpoints protected by an A PA
authentication rate limiting as we.

161
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:16,694
Spoke in my previous slide, discussion
and network segmentation policies.

162
00:13:16,724 --> 00:13:25,114
If we are choosing a NSC level at the
cloud, NSC rules or acls, these are all

163
00:13:25,114 --> 00:13:27,405
the things that needs to be predefined.

164
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:33,230
And most of the cloud providers
pro provide this by default, as

165
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:38,339
when we are consuming their service
for zero trust segmentation.

166
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:42,170
And let's talk about the
framework alignment, right?

167
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:43,579
Operational controls.

168
00:13:43,609 --> 00:13:50,560
This is required for ensuring there
should be an asset management.

169
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:58,319
To ensure, the versioning
and maintenance releases are,

170
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:01,579
appropriately managed and effectively.

171
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:09,539
And for this also, we have identity and
access management for model registries,

172
00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:12,139
which is nothing but access management.

173
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:17,509
A privileged access management is
available with most of the cloud

174
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:23,399
providers, which will clearly
define the roles, rollbacks and

175
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:29,549
responsibilities, a different version
where we can limit the users, depending

176
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:34,409
upon the use case scenarios and the
pipe, excuse me, and the pipelines.

177
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,089
Usage.

178
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:43,329
So this will be, through this we can bring
in more observability at the user levels

179
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:50,019
on who needs to access the production
systems and what can be done by defining

180
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:56,919
the clear roll center rollbacks, using
the, these are, these can be integrated

181
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,839
from the cloud, or if we have our.

182
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:04,624
At the odds that in the past that
I work, they have their own forest

183
00:15:04,624 --> 00:15:10,844
management, which is DNS or, user
management use of active directory.

184
00:15:11,504 --> 00:15:15,974
And that can be, integrated with
cloud providers, privileged access

185
00:15:15,974 --> 00:15:21,374
management roles by defining is,
account and only the people who

186
00:15:21,374 --> 00:15:24,224
are part of those account will be.

187
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:29,459
He able to perform the defined
roles according to the role

188
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:35,339
defined and audit logging across
training and serving pipelines.

189
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:41,799
This is critical for any kind of
debugging or to know exactly what

190
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:47,589
happened in the environment or
while executing the pipelines.

191
00:15:47,964 --> 00:15:49,584
What is the source?

192
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:51,054
What are the targets?

193
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,014
What happened?

194
00:15:52,464 --> 00:15:56,724
And if there is a failure, where
did it go wrong for debugging?

195
00:15:56,874 --> 00:16:03,354
This is going to help us and compliance
validation for regulated ML workloads.

196
00:16:03,474 --> 00:16:08,624
And there should be a, a defined
model of frequently to know to

197
00:16:08,624 --> 00:16:11,064
meet compliance requirements.

198
00:16:11,564 --> 00:16:17,144
And this is also important to automate
security scanning of container images.

199
00:16:17,294 --> 00:16:23,654
Whenever there is an image that we wanted
to deploy or make use of, it has to, or

200
00:16:23,654 --> 00:16:29,684
there should be a model that it should
come to the come to the environment

201
00:16:29,684 --> 00:16:34,494
with proper scanning meeting all the
security and compliance requirements

202
00:16:34,704 --> 00:16:36,354
and the versioning requirements.

203
00:16:37,254 --> 00:16:40,854
Then only it should be allowed
to the, repositories for the

204
00:16:40,854 --> 00:16:42,704
use within the environment.

205
00:16:42,704 --> 00:16:47,384
Specific environment from QA to
production, or it could be from,

206
00:16:47,434 --> 00:16:49,144
testing environment to production

207
00:16:49,644 --> 00:16:51,054
and performance.

208
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:53,874
Now let's talk about
the performance metrics.

209
00:16:53,974 --> 00:16:57,154
And what are the available
tools that we need to consider?

210
00:16:57,304 --> 00:17:03,064
There are public cloud, which will
offer these when we consume their

211
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:06,054
services, or we can have our own.

212
00:17:06,114 --> 00:17:10,424
Every org has its own tools like
performance metrics that can

213
00:17:10,424 --> 00:17:13,434
be measured for the resilience.

214
00:17:13,584 --> 00:17:13,824
Right?

215
00:17:14,514 --> 00:17:17,624
And models are up time, which provides us.

216
00:17:18,044 --> 00:17:23,084
The up times of all the assets in the
production infrastructure, availability

217
00:17:23,594 --> 00:17:30,354
and in interference endpoints, failover
recovery, if there are any, use case

218
00:17:30,354 --> 00:17:35,904
scenarios in the production systems
and automate automated recovery

219
00:17:36,204 --> 00:17:38,574
time from zone level failures.

220
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:41,534
And if there are any
security breaches, right?

221
00:17:41,684 --> 00:17:45,434
Lateral movement incidents
and segmentation deployment.

222
00:17:46,184 --> 00:17:48,974
And these are all must things to consider.

223
00:17:49,154 --> 00:17:54,644
And a training throughput improvement
and distributor training performance,

224
00:17:55,034 --> 00:18:02,614
all these things are must while for
a, measuring platform resiliency and

225
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,774
every organization will have its own.

226
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:07,129
Benchmarking and SLAs.

227
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:09,499
So it has to be planned accordingly.

228
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:14,399
While considering to
define performance metrics,

229
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:17,419
now let's talk about people and process.

230
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:20,839
So this is some of the.

231
00:18:21,214 --> 00:18:22,114
Areas, right?

232
00:18:22,714 --> 00:18:28,384
Where it requires more than technology
that demand cultural shift towards shared

233
00:18:28,384 --> 00:18:30,304
responsibilities across organizational.

234
00:18:30,804 --> 00:18:35,034
When security and available team ownership
extends beyond the infrastructure

235
00:18:35,034 --> 00:18:41,004
teams to include data scientists, ML
engineers, ML ops practitioner, and

236
00:18:41,064 --> 00:18:46,614
platform engineers organization create
systems where resilience is built in it.

237
00:18:47,114 --> 00:18:50,834
Every stage from model development
to deployment and monitoring.

238
00:18:51,494 --> 00:18:56,084
This distributed ownership model
ensures team collaborate on shared

239
00:18:56,144 --> 00:19:01,694
outcomes rather than simply handing
of responsibilities that result.

240
00:19:02,444 --> 00:19:07,579
ML systems that are robust,
secure, scalable by design,

241
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,499
not as an afterthought.

242
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:14,709
And this has to be, as we were talking
about, more on high availability,

243
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:19,509
performance, be benchmarking,
security, availability, scaling, right?

244
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:22,419
These are all, these
shouldn't be afterthought.

245
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:26,819
These should be considered during
the design and planning phase

246
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:31,699
because with the people and process
right now, the responsibilities

247
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:37,699
are shaped where engineering
teams deploy or test in the labs.

248
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:40,084
And roll out a solution.

249
00:19:40,584 --> 00:19:44,064
And the operational teams
productize it, right?

250
00:19:44,094 --> 00:19:48,354
Product teams productize it, and
the operational teams to ensure

251
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:53,694
availability, uptime, and scalability
of this particular product.

252
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:59,504
So all these teams are critical
and they have to go hand in hand

253
00:19:59,504 --> 00:20:06,514
by having a clear understanding
and, on, end to end deployment

254
00:20:06,604 --> 00:20:14,524
of these systems into production
where these key metrics are, met.

255
00:20:15,024 --> 00:20:18,904
So this is the, cross-functional,
responsible model looks like.

256
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,784
And, you can go through the slide,

257
00:20:22,284 --> 00:20:26,884
which will give you a clear, clear
understanding on how the cross-functional

258
00:20:26,884 --> 00:20:28,624
responsibility should look like.

259
00:20:28,654 --> 00:20:33,634
And depending upon the organizational
use, there could be a number of teams,

260
00:20:34,084 --> 00:20:36,424
even more teams like change management.

261
00:20:36,924 --> 00:20:38,004
Vendor management.

262
00:20:38,574 --> 00:20:44,934
All this comes into play depending upon
the kind of cloud we chose, vendors

263
00:20:45,264 --> 00:20:50,184
comes into play and we'll have to
closely work with vendors or the cloud

264
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:57,794
providers to ensure, their well level
of any situation or any support required

265
00:20:57,794 --> 00:21:00,884
for any deployments or availability.

266
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:07,019
And there should be also a clear
visibility on vendor Cloud S

267
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:11,969
maintenance, which should not impact the
availability of a production ML system.

268
00:21:12,469 --> 00:21:18,199
So by ensuring that it is highly
available, architecture is applied there.

269
00:21:18,699 --> 00:21:21,309
Now let's talk about deployment patterns.

270
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:26,019
Cloud native and hybrid, depending on
these are depending upon the typically.

271
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:33,124
When we are moving from legacy to
cloud, we end up using hybrid or

272
00:21:33,364 --> 00:21:38,164
depending upon the journal presence
of the cloud providers, we end up,

273
00:21:38,194 --> 00:21:40,984
we might end up using multi-cloud.

274
00:21:41,484 --> 00:21:46,834
So these are the things that we
need to, consider what model.

275
00:21:47,334 --> 00:21:48,834
What adoption?

276
00:21:48,924 --> 00:21:53,634
Is it a hybrid adoption or a
completely cloud native adoption

277
00:21:54,174 --> 00:21:56,924
or, multi-cloud adoption?

278
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:59,264
What is required for
the use case scenarios?

279
00:21:59,264 --> 00:22:01,784
Depending upon the use case scenarios?

280
00:22:01,874 --> 00:22:07,444
This has to be given a thought
during the design and planning phase.

281
00:22:07,924 --> 00:22:10,504
And again, this is also
not a afterthought.

282
00:22:10,534 --> 00:22:13,864
This has to be given
a good thought before.

283
00:22:13,964 --> 00:22:20,404
Even starting, or I would say
before, considering a locked

284
00:22:20,494 --> 00:22:23,704
architectural design for ML systems

285
00:22:24,204 --> 00:22:30,384
and let's go over these, some of the
areas where in, you know, which talks

286
00:22:30,384 --> 00:22:31,974
about infrastructure foundation.

287
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:34,284
Matters and matter security.

288
00:22:35,064 --> 00:22:38,964
This has to be early, as we
discussed before, design for failure.

289
00:22:39,384 --> 00:22:44,274
How, what is our, recovery strategy,
high availability, and what are

290
00:22:44,274 --> 00:22:46,044
the key components involved in it?

291
00:22:46,714 --> 00:22:49,714
How do we define and
distribute responsibility?

292
00:22:49,714 --> 00:22:53,359
This is between the teams and
there should be clear acy defined.

293
00:22:54,254 --> 00:22:59,334
Between the teams on who is responsible
and who is accountable for what and

294
00:22:59,334 --> 00:23:04,494
how the handholding should be that
should be, clearly defined operational

295
00:23:04,494 --> 00:23:09,224
model and and last measure and iterate.

296
00:23:09,274 --> 00:23:13,804
So establish a clear SL os
for availability performance.

297
00:23:14,374 --> 00:23:19,414
And security, then continuously
improvement against them because from

298
00:23:19,414 --> 00:23:24,964
time to time there will be difference and
there will be different hot fixes that

299
00:23:24,964 --> 00:23:31,114
will be coming in that will different
findings where we will have to quickly

300
00:23:31,174 --> 00:23:33,304
adopt depending upon the criticality.

301
00:23:33,764 --> 00:23:38,494
Some would be, less vulnerable,
some would be highly vulnerable.

302
00:23:39,139 --> 00:23:43,399
And some would be highly critical
where we will have to immediately

303
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:48,659
address those to make sure that
the data or the, the data is not

304
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:54,709
compromised or the environment is not
contaminated with these vulnerabilities.

305
00:23:55,209 --> 00:24:01,149
So with all this, this will ensure that
building a robust, secure, scalable ML

306
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:06,264
systems, when we take all these metrics,
what we have gone through on a high level,

307
00:24:06,634 --> 00:24:12,249
we'll ensure building a robust, secure
environment for production ML systems.

308
00:24:12,749 --> 00:24:15,979
And these are the key take
takeaways from this session.

309
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:21,899
And thank you very much for giving
