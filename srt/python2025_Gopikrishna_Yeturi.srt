1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,360
Good morning team and good morning all.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:07,819
Hello, this is Gopi and today we are
discussing about and I'm going to

3
00:00:07,829 --> 00:00:15,369
give a presentation on SAP BW system
to migrate to AWS cloud and that

4
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:19,799
AWS cloud, the transformation with
enhanced performance and scalability.

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,720
So basically this presentation
outlines a comprehensive strategy

6
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,040
for migrating SAP BW system to AWS.

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,520
Leveraging data driven insight
and proven best practices to

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,630
achieve enhanced performance,
scalability, and cost efficiency.

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,530
This session offers actionable insights,
including a real world example and

10
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:47,720
data driven results, empowering
organizations to confidently embark

11
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,460
on their cloud migration journey.

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,060
So what is the understanding our last A
PBW landscape data volume and complexity,

13
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,790
as well as dependencies and integration?

14
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,059
First, we are going to talk about conduct
a comprehensive assessment of our SAP

15
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:07,899
data ecosystem and S-A-P-B-W ecosystem.

16
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:14,169
Evaluating inate data volumes that
frequently span for terabyte two petabyte

17
00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:19,389
and critical analysis helps identify the
precise cloud infrastructure requirements.

18
00:01:19,784 --> 00:01:24,104
To support our organization's
complex data management needs.

19
00:01:24,554 --> 00:01:27,984
The second option is
dependencies and integration.

20
00:01:28,484 --> 00:01:34,504
Meticulously document and analyze
dependencies across our SAP BW system.

21
00:01:35,134 --> 00:01:41,285
Include, including interstate connections
with ERP platforms, diverse data

22
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:43,555
sources, and enterprise reporting tools.

23
00:01:44,095 --> 00:01:48,804
This holistic mapping ensures a
static, strategic, frictionless

24
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:52,835
migration and integration within
the AWS Cloud environment.

25
00:01:53,684 --> 00:01:59,145
So leveraging AWS for a seamless
migration, AWS Migration Hub,

26
00:01:59,354 --> 00:02:05,164
and second option is AWS Server
Migration Service, that is AWS SMS,

27
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:10,869
and the third option is AWS Database
Migration Service, like AWS DMS.

28
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:17,110
So first, when we, so we are, if we
are going to first option or just

29
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,940
rush our entire migration strategy
through AWS Migration Hub, offering a

30
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,860
unified platform that provide a real
time visibility, tracks, progress

31
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,720
and enable cross team collaboration
for a streamlined transformation.

32
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,905
If I go with AWS Server Managed Migration
Service, Automatic and accelerate your

33
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:43,225
server migrate with AWS Server Migration
Service, reducing a manual intervention,

34
00:02:43,565 --> 00:02:48,405
minimizing potential downtime, and
ensuring a smooth risk migrated

35
00:02:48,405 --> 00:02:50,685
transition to the cloud infrastructure.

36
00:02:51,085 --> 00:02:55,665
The third one is AWS Data
Migration Service, AWS DMS.

37
00:02:56,165 --> 00:03:01,705
Execute a precision driven database
migration using AWS Database

38
00:03:01,705 --> 00:03:06,452
Migration Service, enabling zero
downtime replication, data integrity

39
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:12,274
presentation, and seamless transformation
of our SAP database ecosystem.

40
00:03:13,064 --> 00:03:16,014
optimizing the data transfer
for a large data sets.

41
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:19,124
If you're using image
and S3 for data storage.

42
00:03:19,624 --> 00:03:23,604
Or AWS data direct connect
high speed transfers.

43
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:29,284
So if I go with the S3 data storage
utilize image and S3 advanced object

44
00:03:29,284 --> 00:03:38,174
storage architecture to securely host SAP
BW data sets Providing petabyte two scale,

45
00:03:38,224 --> 00:03:47,414
scale storage with 99.9999% of durability,
automating data replication, and storage

46
00:03:47,474 --> 00:03:49,604
options for optimal cost management.

47
00:03:50,054 --> 00:03:53,894
If you go with AWS Direct connect
for it, high speed transformation.

48
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:59,534
Implement AWS Direct Connect to
establish a private dedicated network

49
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:02,849
connection with a consistent 1 2 10 gb.

50
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:08,859
BS bandwidth, enabling encrypted low
latency data migration and reducing

51
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:14,369
network complexity compared to
traditional internet based transfers.

52
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:18,129
enhancing performance
in the AWS environment.

53
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:19,659
Imagine EWS.

54
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:26,389
leveraging, leverage provisional IOPS
EBS volumes to deliver high performance

55
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:34,089
and low latency BW workloads, ensuring
constant IO performance and rapid data

56
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:36,009
retrieval for complex analytical process.

57
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,109
Optimized EC2 instance.

58
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:44,699
Strategically select a memory optimized
or computer optimized EC2 instance

59
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:51,939
that align precisely with our SAP VW
concept, computationally complexity,

60
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,084
enabling scalable performance and
cost efficient resource allocation.

61
00:04:57,584 --> 00:04:59,914
Ensuring scalability and reliability.

62
00:05:00,094 --> 00:05:02,664
What is the high performance
infrastructure or dynamic

63
00:05:02,664 --> 00:05:03,704
resource optimization?

64
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,014
What is a high performance infrastructure?

65
00:05:06,604 --> 00:05:12,754
Generally, if big systems like SAP
VW systems, we are going to use X

66
00:05:12,754 --> 00:05:17,074
large EC2 instance strategically
designated to accelerate complex SAP

67
00:05:17,074 --> 00:05:23,944
VW analytical workloads, delivering
a robust processing capabilities

68
00:05:24,054 --> 00:05:25,584
and expensive memory resources.

69
00:05:26,254 --> 00:05:28,504
for sophisticated data queries.

70
00:05:28,914 --> 00:05:34,664
If we go with the dynamic resource
optimization, deploy AWS autoscaling to

71
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:41,444
intelligently and automatically modulate
EC2 instance capacity in real time,

72
00:05:41,964 --> 00:05:46,704
dynamically reporting to fluctuating
workloads demand while maintaining

73
00:05:46,704 --> 00:05:48,654
peak performance and cost efficiency.

74
00:05:48,654 --> 00:05:54,204
Optimizing SAP BW for cloud performance,
cloud specific configuration,

75
00:05:54,744 --> 00:05:56,914
tune your SAP BW parameters.

76
00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:01,979
For cloud specific configurations,
taking advantage of AWS services

77
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:06,769
for features to enhance performance
and reduce resource consumption.

78
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:08,989
Second one is query optimization.

79
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:15,309
Optimize our query SAP BW queries to
minimize processing time and improve

80
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:20,525
response times, ensuring efficient
data retrieval and analysis purpose.

81
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:21,787
Cost reduction.

82
00:06:21,787 --> 00:06:24,179
Optimize our AWS resource.

83
00:06:24,194 --> 00:06:26,406
the first one is, performance testing,
the second one is, utilization to

84
00:06:26,406 --> 00:06:29,571
reduce overall cost, leveraging
cost effective EC2 instance, and

85
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:32,221
storage option to minimize expense.

86
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:35,651
Regardless, post migration testing.

87
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:39,941
Once the migration is complete,
then we are going to do that

88
00:06:40,141 --> 00:06:41,521
different type of testing.

89
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:46,181
The first one is functional testing,
second one is performance testing,

90
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,492
third one is, Security testing.

91
00:06:48,912 --> 00:06:53,062
Generally, the functional testing
functional team will validate the core

92
00:06:53,102 --> 00:06:59,092
functionalities such as a data loading,
reporting and data analysis operated

93
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:01,812
as expected in the AWS environment.

94
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:05,982
Also, once the functional testing
completed, we are going to

95
00:07:05,982 --> 00:07:07,481
deal with performance testing.

96
00:07:08,112 --> 00:07:13,232
Generally, the performance,
like the SAP BW system, in any

97
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:18,062
organization, it's a high system,
high volume, high resources system.

98
00:07:18,902 --> 00:07:23,112
Once the migrating completely, we are
going to do that performance testing

99
00:07:23,112 --> 00:07:28,622
in AWS environment, perform performance
tester under various load scenarios

100
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:33,592
to ensure That the migrating system
can handle with anticipated workload

101
00:07:33,602 --> 00:07:36,282
demands the final security testing.

102
00:07:36,872 --> 00:07:41,932
So generally SAP BW system and
ERP system, any ERP system is

103
00:07:41,972 --> 00:07:44,492
going for audit for that purpose.

104
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:53,252
Various security of our migrated SAP BW
system in the AWS environment and ensuring

105
00:07:53,252 --> 00:07:55,182
data integrity and confidentiality.

106
00:07:55,682 --> 00:08:01,512
Embracing the power of AWS for SAP BW,
enhance its scalability, leverage us.

107
00:08:02,297 --> 00:08:07,337

our S-A-P-B-W system up and down,

108
00:08:07,747 --> 00:08:10,987
based on our changing analytical needs.

109
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:16,037
Ensure optimal resource allocation,
increased performance, utilize

110
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:20,177
the AWS High Performance Computing
resources and optimize slower

111
00:08:20,177 --> 00:08:26,197
resolution to significantly improve
the performance of S-A-P-B-W system.

112
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:28,778
Register the cost benefit from AWS.

113
00:08:29,432 --> 00:08:34,562
Cost effective price models and
optimized resource utilization to

114
00:08:34,602 --> 00:08:40,012
achieve significant cost saving
compared to on premises environment.

115
00:08:40,162 --> 00:08:43,612
Sorry, key takeaways
and actionable insights.

116
00:08:43,752 --> 00:08:45,552
The first one is strategic planning.

117
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:49,972
The second one is leverage
