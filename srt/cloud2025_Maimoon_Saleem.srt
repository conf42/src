1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,730
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,610
My name is Mehmood Saleem, and I work as a
senior program manager in the tech sector.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,350
I will be speaking on the topic of
revolutionizing last mile delivery,

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,650
the power of cloud computing and IoT.

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,060
This talk is structured into three parts.

6
00:00:13,229 --> 00:00:17,479
The first part goes around introduction
and importance of last mile, the bot.

7
00:00:17,909 --> 00:00:21,439
The second part presents the challenges
in the sector and the role of cloud

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,729
and IoT in parts two, three, and
four on the slide, the so what.

9
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:28,070
The third part is around real world
use cases and industry examples.

10
00:00:28,735 --> 00:00:32,655
Followed by a teaser into how the next
five years in the space would look like.

11
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,735
Finally, the closing, the so what.

12
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:38,405
The obvious question that
pops up is, what is last mile?

13
00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:42,395
So last mile is the last leg of the
journey of a parcel or shipment to you.

14
00:00:42,855 --> 00:00:46,384
The object started from a vendor,
went through a warehouse, probably

15
00:00:46,384 --> 00:00:50,034
in a semi urban area, reached a
final mile warehouse, and then was

16
00:00:50,195 --> 00:00:52,695
dispatched to the ultimate customer, i.

17
00:00:52,695 --> 00:00:52,995
e.

18
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:53,374
you.

19
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:58,185
This is the customer facing part of the
journey in the supply chain of e commerce.

20
00:00:58,545 --> 00:01:03,294
Another reason for the importance of
LastMile is the fact that 53 percent of

21
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:08,085
total shipping costs stem from LastMile,
primarily rider driver wages, fuel,

22
00:01:08,425 --> 00:01:10,285
insurance, and maintenance of vehicles.

23
00:01:11,074 --> 00:01:16,045
Purpose of this talk is to elucidate
how IoT and cloud computing are

24
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:19,435
transforming LastMile delivery
through real time tracking, predictive

25
00:01:19,615 --> 00:01:21,585
analytics, and smart logistics.

26
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:25,065
Coming to challenges in the
last mile delivery space.

27
00:01:25,435 --> 00:01:27,865
Firstly, the high cost inefficiency.

28
00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:31,695
Last mile logistics are expensive
due to fuel costs, traffic

29
00:01:31,705 --> 00:01:33,605
congestion, and failed deliveries.

30
00:01:34,054 --> 00:01:35,645
Secondly, lack of visibility.

31
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:38,935
Traditional logistics lack
real time tracking, leading

32
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:40,395
to poor delivery accuracy.

33
00:01:40,845 --> 00:01:42,905
And finally, customer expectations.

34
00:01:43,175 --> 00:01:44,525
The customer is never happy.

35
00:01:44,825 --> 00:01:48,465
Consumers expect fast, reliable,
and transparent deliveries, a

36
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:50,145
challenge for the logistic providers.

37
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:55,155
Amazon Same Day Delivery has set the bar
very high for other companies to match.

38
00:01:55,505 --> 00:01:59,585
Customer expectations are growing
fast around free and fast deliveries.

39
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:04,495
Role of Cloud Computing in Last
Mile Logistics So, Cloud Computing

40
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:06,604
allows real time data processing.

41
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:11,444
Cloud platforms are able to process large
volumes of logistics data in real time,

42
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:13,734
enabling accurate tracking and routing.

43
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:18,405
Cloud based algorithms can analyze
traffic conditions, delivery windows, and

44
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:22,845
package sizes in real time to calculate
the most efficient delivery routes,

45
00:02:22,905 --> 00:02:25,795
minimizing delivery time and costs.

46
00:02:26,465 --> 00:02:30,454
Secondly, predictive analytics
utilizes machine learning algorithms

47
00:02:30,455 --> 00:02:34,324
to forecast demand, optimize delivery
routes, and predict delivery time.

48
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,835
Thirdly, scalable infrastructure.

49
00:02:37,105 --> 00:02:40,145
Cloud solutions scale
effortlessly during peak periods.

50
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:44,315
For example, Black Friday,
Prime Day, allowing even smaller

51
00:02:44,335 --> 00:02:48,305
companies to flex their operations
during these peak periods.

52
00:02:48,705 --> 00:02:53,735
Example of this would be AWS, Amazon
Web Services, which powers Amazon's last

53
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:57,165
mile logistics by optimizing delivery
routes and inventory management.

54
00:02:57,665 --> 00:03:00,965
Now coming to the impact
of IoT on smart logistics.

55
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:03,545
So firstly, real time
tracking and monitoring.

56
00:03:03,925 --> 00:03:07,865
IoT devices, for example, GPS
trackers, RFID tags, provide real

57
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:11,515
time location data, and also provide
condition monitoring, for example,

58
00:03:11,695 --> 00:03:13,654
for temperature sensitive products.

59
00:03:14,334 --> 00:03:15,785
Secondly, smart warehousing.

60
00:03:16,124 --> 00:03:20,195
IoT enabled warehouses use connected
sensors and automated picking systems

61
00:03:20,404 --> 00:03:25,055
for faster order fulfillment, allowing
for a better last mile operation.

62
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:26,985
Thirdly, fleet management.

63
00:03:27,325 --> 00:03:31,015
IoT devices in delivery vehicles
monitor fuel consumption, driver

64
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:32,705
behavior, and vehicle maintenance.

65
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:34,775
Reducing operational costs.

66
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:39,485
An example of this from the industry would
be DHL's IoT enabled delivery vehicles,

67
00:03:39,695 --> 00:03:43,765
which reduce fuel costs by 15 percent
using real time route optimization.

68
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,085
Coming to real world use
cases and industry examples.

69
00:03:47,365 --> 00:03:48,405
Firstly, Amazon.

70
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:52,955
Amazon combines AWS Cloud Analytics
and IoT devices for real time

71
00:03:52,955 --> 00:03:55,885
route optimization and delivery
prediction and was able to

72
00:03:55,885 --> 00:03:58,645
reduce its delivery times by 25%.

73
00:03:59,135 --> 00:04:00,085
Another example is UPS.

74
00:04:00,585 --> 00:04:05,165
which uses Orion, on road integrated
optimization and navigation, powered

75
00:04:05,185 --> 00:04:09,154
by cloud computing and IoT, which
saved 10 million gallons of fuel

76
00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:10,955
annually and is still doing so.

77
00:04:11,374 --> 00:04:15,935
Finally, Alibaba's Kyrio network,
which leverages IoT enabled smart

78
00:04:15,935 --> 00:04:19,785
lockers and cloud logistics for
contactless last mile delivery.

79
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:24,615
Now, as promised in the early part of
the presentation, what is coming in the

80
00:04:24,615 --> 00:04:26,635
next five years in the last mile space?

81
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:31,310
Two technologies will change the
landscape of last mile delivery till 2030.

82
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,550
One being drones and the second
being autonomous vehicles.

83
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,680
Technological and regulatory constraints
have held back the two technologies

84
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:44,299
till date, but that is changing fast
and will continue doing so up till 2030.

85
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:49,790
On one hand, drones have seen
growing adoption by FAA, the Federal

86
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,669
Aviation Administration in the U.
S., and the EU is looking to work

87
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,449
on drone fleet legislation as well.

88
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,030
On the other hand, in AVs, the U. S.,
Europe, China, and Japan are at the

89
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:05,200
forefront of AV innovation, and regulatory
environments are being created that

90
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,919
encourage safe development and testing.

91
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:13,059
For drones, Amazon is working on MK30,
and Alibaba has started drone delivery

92
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,079
for selected products in Shanghai.

93
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:21,080
For AVs, mobility companies are working
on AVs, and one use case being researched

94
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,020
and trialed is last mile delivery.

95
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,410
In five years, cloud and IoT will be the
enablers that would drive mass adoption.

96
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,460
You would see a swarm of drones in
the air delivering shipments and

97
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,420
AVs delivering without drivers.

98
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,210
Both these technologies would drive
a reduction in A, cost per delivery

99
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:40,880
because no humans would be involved.

100
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,720
B, delivery times being because
you would be able to bypass urban

101
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,010
congestion and traffic jams.

102
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:52,165
Thirdly, less moving parts would mean
less carbon footprint and more Uh,

103
00:05:52,205 --> 00:05:54,055
environmentally friendly deliveries.

104
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:56,165
Now coming to some final thoughts.

105
00:05:56,495 --> 00:05:59,794
The key takeaway from the talk is
that cloud computing and IoT are

106
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:04,424
revolutionizing last mile delivery by
enhancing visibility, reducing costs,

107
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,294
and meeting customer expectations.

108
00:06:06,624 --> 00:06:10,465
The future outlook of last
mile deliveries looks bright.

109
00:06:10,895 --> 00:06:14,985
Furthermore, integration of AI
and 5G with cloud and IoT will

110
00:06:15,005 --> 00:06:16,555
further optimize this space.

111
00:06:17,015 --> 00:06:20,665
Closing statement would be that by
embracing cloud computing and IoT,

112
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,700
Businesses can transform last mile
delivery from a cost center to a

113
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,640
significant competitive advantage.

114
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,410
Thanks for being a patient audience.

115
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,470
I hope you are as excited as me about
the future of last mile logistics.

116
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,159
Thank you
