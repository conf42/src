00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:01,590
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,780
I'm Rag Ola, senior Cloud architect
at Miracle Software Systems.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,960
While my core work has been in pharmacy,
retail, and food industries today I'm

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,000
excited to share how those relationship
play breakthrough in cloud banking through

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,380
ours cloud banking algorithm or ECBA.

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:27,169
Let's begin with the challenge
that inspired ECBA and why secure

7
00:00:27,409 --> 00:00:29,270
scalable transactions are more.

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,450
Critical the digital banking challenge.

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,010
Growing demands, digital banking
has transformed financial

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,290
services, creating unprecedented
pressure on transaction systems.

11
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:46,780
Cloud environments must deliver high
performance processing, uncompromising

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,804
security regularity, comprehensive
continuous availability, traditional

13
00:00:51,804 --> 00:00:54,485
load balancing falls short round robin.

14
00:00:54,985 --> 00:00:58,855
Distributes requests sequentially
without considering server

15
00:00:58,855 --> 00:01:00,895
capacity or current workload.

16
00:01:01,585 --> 00:01:07,734
So leading to uneven utilization, leased
connection routes to servers with fewest

17
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:13,495
connections, but ignores processing
power and response times common problems.

18
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:19,615
So dynamic workloads cause bottlenecks,
uneven resource utilization, and degraded

19
00:01:19,615 --> 00:01:21,384
service quality in banking system.

20
00:01:21,884 --> 00:01:24,464
Introducing E-C-B-A-E-C-B-A.

21
00:01:24,705 --> 00:01:30,074
The Ansible Cloud banking algorithm
is a hybrid approach combining weight

22
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:33,225
round robin and adaptive load balancing.

23
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:38,324
It's designed to intelligently
manage cloud banking transactions.

24
00:01:38,774 --> 00:01:42,914
Let's look at how ECBA works
and how it adapts in real time.

25
00:01:43,414 --> 00:01:48,095
ECBA monitors, server capacity,
transaction types, latency.

26
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,190
And throughput.

27
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,789
It routes request based on real-time
metrics and predictive analytics with AI

28
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,280
forecasting and reinforcement learning.

29
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,680
ECBA evolves continuously anticipating
spikes before they happen.

30
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,140
A spotlight is behind ECBA intelligence.

31
00:02:08,615 --> 00:02:13,085
It enables fraud detection, predictor
routing, conce monitoring, and.

32
00:02:13,585 --> 00:02:19,825
Even self-healing in DevSecOps, these
capabilities make ECBA, not just

33
00:02:19,825 --> 00:02:21,865
a scalable but smart and secure.

34
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:26,175
Let's look at how we validated
this research methodology.

35
00:02:26,775 --> 00:02:30,585
Python based simulations, we
conducted comprehensive testing

36
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:36,285
across various workloads to benchmark
performance workload ranges.

37
00:02:36,425 --> 00:02:40,685
We tested from thousand two,
10,000 transactions compared agist.

38
00:02:41,525 --> 00:02:46,985
Round Robin leased connection and
standalone A LB measured response time

39
00:02:47,285 --> 00:02:53,825
and throughput and utilization, real world
banking transaction patterns, integrated

40
00:02:54,455 --> 00:03:00,995
power ly detection to validate system
behavior under unexpected load conditions.

41
00:03:01,505 --> 00:03:06,695
Future simulations will integrate a
models to predict workload spikes and

42
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:09,035
based on historical transaction data.

43
00:03:09,535 --> 00:03:10,135
Performance.

44
00:03:10,135 --> 00:03:11,605
8,000 transactions.

45
00:03:11,905 --> 00:03:13,345
8,000 transactions.

46
00:03:13,465 --> 00:03:18,175
ECBA achieved the lowest response
time, just 15 point milliseconds.

47
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:24,915
That significant efficiency gain,
let's see how it performs under heavier

48
00:03:24,915 --> 00:03:30,855
load scaling to 5,000 transactions
as we scale to 5,000 transactions.

49
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:32,940
ECBA maintained its age.

50
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:39,420
With 36.9 requests per
second and 83.3% utilization.

51
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,610
This consistency under pressure is
what makes ECPA enterprise ready.

52
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,070
Let's summarize the key advantages.

53
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:53,690
ECPA ensures fairness, prevents overload,
and maintains performance, consistency,

54
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,210
even under fluctuating workloads.

55
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,590
These strengths are especially
critical in secure environment.

56
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,860
Let's talk about DevSecOps integration.

57
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,170
DevSecOps Integration, ECB operates
within DevOps SecOps frameworks to

58
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:13,430
ensure end-to-end encryption for
transactions regularity, compliance

59
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:18,080
monitoring, AI power compliance
in monitoring, continuously scans

60
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,200
for anomalously and regular risks.

61
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,080
Audit trial generation a driven.

62
00:04:24,425 --> 00:04:27,755
Threat detection identifies
suspicious traffic patterns in

63
00:04:27,755 --> 00:04:33,365
real time using behavior, analyze,
analyzing, and automated risk scoring.

64
00:04:33,935 --> 00:04:38,015
So resilience features, so built in
capabilities for security operations.

65
00:04:38,555 --> 00:04:43,495
So ECB operates within dec DevSecOps
Frameworks supports encryption,

66
00:04:44,365 --> 00:04:47,314
ly detection, audit trials,
and zero trust architecture.

67
00:04:48,124 --> 00:04:51,574
It's built for resilience
and regularity alignment.

68
00:04:52,054 --> 00:04:54,064
Now let's talk about the implementation.

69
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:58,554
Deploying ECBA starts with
infrastructure assessment, metric

70
00:04:58,554 --> 00:05:01,044
configuration, and rigorous testing.

71
00:05:01,614 --> 00:05:04,674
It's designed for continuous optimization.

72
00:05:05,244 --> 00:05:10,224
Let's explore how ECBA applies
across real world banking patterns.

73
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:12,374
So real world banking patterns.

74
00:05:12,704 --> 00:05:16,409
So from payment processing to
fraud detection, ECBA, adapt.

75
00:05:17,324 --> 00:05:21,434
Across platforms, ensuring
seamlessly customer experiences

76
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:23,054
and real time analysis.

77
00:05:23,504 --> 00:05:26,864
These use cases show ECBA Ality.

78
00:05:27,254 --> 00:05:30,194
Let's wrap up with key
advantages and key takeaways.

79
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,284
So key takeaways from here.

80
00:05:33,764 --> 00:05:34,904
Here is what we learn.

81
00:05:34,964 --> 00:05:37,934
Hybrid algorithm, alpha
form legacy methods.

82
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:42,614
Adaptability is essential, and
AI transforms load balancing.

83
00:05:43,154 --> 00:05:45,464
ECPA isn't just a technique upgrade.

84
00:05:45,884 --> 00:05:46,724
Technical upgrade.

85
00:05:47,204 --> 00:05:50,744
It's a strategic leap
forward for cloud banking.

86
00:05:51,244 --> 00:05:51,724
Thank you.

87
00:05:52,224 --> 00:05:53,694
Thank you for your attention.

88
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:57,734
I hope ECBS sparks ideas for
your one in cloud strategies.

89
00:05:58,094 --> 00:05:59,984
