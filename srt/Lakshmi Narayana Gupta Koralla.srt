1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,380
Hello.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,340
Very good morning.

3
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,560
So this is Lakshmi RN gta.

4
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,440
I'm working in the Starbucks
as a senior data engineer.

5
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,060
So today we are going to talk about
hyper personalization, transforming

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,810
digital experience through
advanced data analytics and ai.

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,030
So the, firstly, the hyper personalization
represent a paradigm shift in customer

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,830
experience operating on the principle
of dynamic identity recognition.

9
00:00:26,325 --> 00:00:31,485
So the concept that consumer preferences
exist in constant contextual facts

10
00:00:31,515 --> 00:00:33,375
rather than their fixed attributes.

11
00:00:33,735 --> 00:00:38,625
So this approach leverages real time data
analytics, AI and mission learning to

12
00:00:38,714 --> 00:00:40,935
deliver precisely tailored experiences.

13
00:00:41,925 --> 00:00:45,614
Organizations implementing
hyper personalization strategies

14
00:00:45,705 --> 00:00:49,330
achieve substantial improvements
in conversation rates, customer

15
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,090
retention and operational efficiencies
through algorithm architecture.

16
00:00:55,845 --> 00:00:59,385
President engagement systems and
signal intelligence ecosystems.

17
00:00:59,535 --> 00:01:05,045
So the inquiry demonstrates how
organization es incognitive computing

18
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:09,214
frameworks, multi-dimensional
attribution attribute systems and

19
00:01:09,214 --> 00:01:13,505
privacy, enhancing computation to
balance improved customer experiences

20
00:01:13,505 --> 00:01:15,304
with ethical consideration and.

21
00:01:17,525 --> 00:01:21,755
Ultimately achieving this measurable
business value to more precise

22
00:01:21,755 --> 00:01:26,825
targeting, enhanced customer journeys,
and strengthen relationship durability.

23
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:32,875
Okay, next the next we'll go
with what the concept framework.

24
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:37,695
The the very first thing is
algorithm edition architecture.

25
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:44,159
So the Salesforce customer 360 platform
processes, 80 plus billion AI predictions

26
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,559
dialed through algorithmic edition
architecture where AI systems continuously

27
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:54,570
recalibrate customer interactions
based on micro feedback loops.

28
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:02,160
These clients there 20% in conversation
rates and 27% higher average order values.

29
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,389
Hardwar Business School
research identifies four pillars

30
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:08,190
underlying this transformation.

31
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:13,779
Integrated data ecosystems, talent
hybridization, ethical governance,

32
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:15,670
and continuous experimentation.

33
00:02:16,029 --> 00:02:21,129
Companies expecting these characteristic
percent higher shareholder returns by

34
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:25,524
fundamentally changing how decisions
propagate through organizations.

35
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:30,369
Okay, and the next one is the
precision engagement systems.

36
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:35,694
A prominent software companies
experience platform employs computational

37
00:02:35,694 --> 00:02:41,244
contextualization process in
environmental, behavioral, and historical

38
00:02:41,304 --> 00:02:47,634
variable simultaneously explaining how
a pharmaceutical company achieved 8%

39
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,019
higher perception earlier and through.

40
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:54,820
Patient specific adopt to messaging
organizations with unified

41
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,239
customer data platforms achieved
personalization maturity scores

42
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:03,730
2.8 times higher than fragmented
architectures by ably cross contextual

43
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,769
consistency across touch points.

44
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:10,339
And the next one, the
mechanism based value creation.

45
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:17,029
A streaming services recommendation
system influence 75% of the content stream

46
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:18,825
through preference cascade modeling.

47
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:24,290
So the tracking, how initial choices
create ripple defects across the

48
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,900
preference I heard is, so this
explains there 90% retention rate

49
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:34,870
work, 8.5 billion annually as a
system minimizes such friction while

50
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,210
maintaining perceived choice anatomy.

51
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:42,940
An e-commerce company applies elastically
fingerprinting, identifying unique

52
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:49,440
price sensitivity patterns at individual
levels, explaining their 28% increase card

53
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,270
conversation as prices aligned with the
individual willingness to pay thresholds.

54
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,415
A digital audio platform
utilizes a multimodal preference

55
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:04,230
interference to extract insight
from seemingly unrelated behaviors.

56
00:04:05,085 --> 00:04:10,215
Driving 3.0 times higher customer
engagement through computing

57
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:14,475
relevance effects where each
person's interaction increases the

58
00:04:14,475 --> 00:04:16,755
accuracy of subsequent experiences.

59
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:23,054
The financial institutions develop
financial behavior, twins as simulations

60
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:28,815
of individual making, explaining
why organization transitioning to

61
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,650
AI has a core competency, realize.

62
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:38,405
22% operational efficiency by preemptively
addressing like service needs.

63
00:04:38,914 --> 00:04:41,895
So retailers, employees
behavior compounding.

64
00:04:41,925 --> 00:04:47,425
Understanding how past packages create
future poten propensities expanding

65
00:04:48,175 --> 00:04:53,275
at 24% increase in digital sales by
targeting micro edition points where

66
00:04:53,275 --> 00:04:55,995
purchase in trends, intent criticizes.

67
00:04:57,645 --> 00:05:02,295
Healthcare provides, implement
behavior notes architecture in

68
00:05:02,355 --> 00:05:06,885
identifying psychological barriers
to optimal health behaviors.

69
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:14,844
How one consortium user reduce appointment
no shows by 30% through contextual

70
00:05:15,265 --> 00:05:20,364
amplification where AI identifies factor
overlooked in the standard protocols.

71
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,710
Okay, next.

72
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,260
We'll go with technical.

73
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:26,620
What is that?

74
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,110
What is the technical infra
infrastructure of this one?

75
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,540
The technical foundation of hyper
personation relies on sophisticated

76
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,490
signal intelligence ecosystems, so it
is integrated framework that collect

77
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:45,340
process and activate data in real time,
enabling genuine individualization beyond

78
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,955
traditional segmentation approaches.

79
00:05:48,935 --> 00:05:53,625
And then in here the first one is
multi-source data orchestration.

80
00:05:54,124 --> 00:05:57,814
The foundation layer employs
the Signal Fusion architecture

81
00:05:58,114 --> 00:06:02,854
systematically integrating
heterogeneous data systems to create

82
00:06:02,854 --> 00:06:04,715
comprehensive customer understanding.

83
00:06:05,044 --> 00:06:11,164
The Twilio segments research across
3,450 business leaders found that made

84
00:06:11,164 --> 00:06:16,284
sure organization collective data for
data from 6.2 different sources versus.

85
00:06:16,299 --> 00:06:19,119
2.34 less sophisticated ones.

86
00:06:19,989 --> 00:06:25,389
This multi-source approach enable
enables dimensional identity resolution,

87
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:29,969
connecting fragmented customer
interactions into coherent profiles.

88
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:34,899
A leading beauty a leading beauty
retailer implemented this concept by

89
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:39,909
capturing 80 distinct behavioral signal
through its loyalty program, increasing

90
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:45,009
repeat purchases rates by 65% through
more accurate preference recognition.

91
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:50,589
While 65% of organization reduce third
party cookie dependencies dependence,

92
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:57,129
72% increase investments in privacy,
compliment, complement alternatives.

93
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:02,649
Those successfully navigating this
transition achieve 75% higher satisfaction

94
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:09,584
scores through consent based intelligence
framework that respect privacy preferences

95
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:11,769
while maintaining personalization quality.

96
00:07:13,074 --> 00:07:16,314
And the next one is like real
time processing frameworks.

97
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:20,124
So this real time processing framework,
the automation implement contextual

98
00:07:20,214 --> 00:07:25,309
trigger systems that respond immediate
situational factors, each archive.

99
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:29,589
Two x the higher response rates.

100
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:34,269
This reflects the concept of movement,
relevant computing, delivering

101
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:36,969
experiences at precise decision points.

102
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:41,859
A financial services company applies
this by processing location data

103
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,674
and transition history by context
advice, increasing mobile engagement

104
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:49,509
by 35% through timely interventions.

105
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:55,089
So data integration is challenging
with 83% of organizations.

106
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:58,249
Say setting it as their primary obstacle.

107
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:00,200
The healthcare leader,

108
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:06,439
unified data architecture, centralizing
70 plus data sources and reducing

109
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:13,129
preparation time from weeks to
hours, improving medication a by 25%

110
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:15,229
through more timely interventions.

111
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,619
And then the algorithmic, the next
layer is algorithmic intelligence layer.

112
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:26,749
The machine learning forms that the
core intelligence layer with companies

113
00:08:26,749 --> 00:08:32,750
implementing advanced ML reporting a 35%
average increase in conversion rates.

114
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:37,460
This reflects a concept of algorithmic
vision optimization, continuously

115
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,230
improving choice architecture.

116
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,450
Through automated experimentation.

117
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:49,010
A media company employs 16 distinct
ML models contributing to a 12%.

118
00:08:49,744 --> 00:08:54,875
Increase in per guest spending
through what experts call experience

119
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:59,585
orchestration, coordinating multiple
personalization dimensions simultaneously.

120
00:08:59,944 --> 00:09:05,645
Deep planning models enable pattern
recognition at scale with organization

121
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:12,335
implementing these capabilities, achieving
2.5 x higher engagement rates, digital

122
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:15,004
audio platforms, neural networks, process.

123
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:21,849
Acoustic futures to create recommendations
reducing churn by 20% through preference

124
00:09:21,849 --> 00:09:26,559
prediction, understanding future desserts
before customers recognize themselves.

125
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:32,559
Okay, and next real time
implementation strategies.

126
00:09:32,624 --> 00:09:38,369
So by transforming data insights into
personalized experiences requires

127
00:09:38,609 --> 00:09:40,559
latency optimized delivery systems.

128
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,520
So the framework, it was that minimized
the gap between signal detection and

129
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,650
experience delivery according to head
sales softwares analysis of 500 plus

130
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:54,699
marketing initiatives, organizations
implementing real time personalization

131
00:09:56,199 --> 00:10:01,569
achieve 35% higher conversation
rates through the what exports term?

132
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:04,689
Temporal romance maximization.

133
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,555
So delivering content
precisely well, customer.

134
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:15,159
Receptively peaks, companies with a
major capabilities deliver experiences

135
00:10:15,219 --> 00:10:20,409
within 1.8 seconds of trigger during
event versus industry averages

136
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:24,069
exceeding 10 seconds capitalizes.

137
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:26,300
In on the attention decay principle.

138
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,650
The concept that personalization
effectiveness diminishes exponentially

139
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,760
with the delay, the out of strategies.

140
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,540
The first one is.

141
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,970
The content orchestration systems.

142
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,840
So the Dynamic Content Assembly
represent the most visible

143
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,690
implementation access aspect.

144
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:49,510
Employing modular content architecture,
so breaking experiences into independently

145
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,850
personalized components and charges.

146
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:58,030
Analysis of 18 1 18 50 Growth Market has
found that companies with sophisticated

147
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,950
delivery infrastructures experience.

148
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:05,410
28% higher engagement rates through
contextual context adaption,

149
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,660
automatically adjusting message
string based on situational factors.

150
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:16,570
A hotel chains implementation enables
personalized delivery across 18 brands

151
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:23,260
through identity anchored experiences,
maintaining consistent recognition, and

152
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,675
despite fragmented customer journeys.

153
00:11:26,455 --> 00:11:31,075
So this approach yields a 25%
improvement in direct booking rates

154
00:11:31,075 --> 00:11:37,115
by employing distribution channel
optimization intelligently steering

155
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:39,545
customers toward warn booking parts.

156
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:43,595
And the next one,
adoptive pricing systems.

157
00:11:43,985 --> 00:11:48,834
So this dynamic pricing mechanisms
optimize offers through willingness

158
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,395
to pay elastically model.

159
00:11:50,814 --> 00:11:51,625
So determining.

160
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:56,410
Individual price and security thresholds,
companies implementing AI driven pricing

161
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:01,719
experience outage revenue increases
of 10% by addressing the perception

162
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:06,790
of succession value gap, aligning
prices, individual value perception,

163
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:12,250
and airline realtime engine analyzes
millions software combinations daily.

164
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:18,760
So incorporating one 50 plus variables
to improve eel management by 6%

165
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,130
through demand forecasting position.

166
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,610
Accurately predicting
fluctuations in travel intent.

167
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:31,490
A retail corporation address 1.2
plus million price points daily,

168
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:38,630
improving margin by 1.8% points
while increasing market share by 3.0

169
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,625
points through competitive response.

170
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:45,260
Elastically, understanding
how specific customer segments

171
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,850
react to competitor pricing.

172
00:12:48,694 --> 00:12:52,295
The next one, the cross channel
experience architecture.

173
00:12:53,735 --> 00:12:58,275
This de the consistently experiences
across touch points through cross

174
00:12:58,275 --> 00:13:03,195
contextual identity resolution, the
maintaining recognition as customers

175
00:13:03,255 --> 00:13:09,105
travels, channels, organizations achieving
this capability report customer lifetime

176
00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:15,395
values, 2.5 times higher than those
who those with fragmented approaches.

177
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,360
A department store chains unified
framework maintenance profiles

178
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,930
for 43 million customers.

179
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:30,470
Reconciling identify ident identities
across eight plus channels with 90%

180
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:36,320
accuracy, increasing repeat purchase
rates by 30% through friction

181
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:41,900
elimination, removing barriers
created by disjointed experiences.

182
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,480
And the next one, decision system.

183
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:49,205
The real time interaction management
systems like Millisecond Edition

184
00:13:49,355 --> 00:13:54,095
about optimal content through
edition velocity architecture.

185
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:58,325
The frameworks optimized
for speed critical choices.

186
00:13:58,685 --> 00:14:01,925
Organizations implementing
these capabilities achieved

187
00:14:02,345 --> 00:14:05,620
2.8 x higher marketing, ROI.

188
00:14:07,655 --> 00:14:11,255
So the next one, next topic
is advanced AI applications.

189
00:14:11,495 --> 00:14:16,780
So by using ai artificial intelligence
has fundamentally transformed

190
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,860
personalization capabilities through
cognitive computing frameworks.

191
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:27,450
The systems that stim simulate human
taught process to anticipate needs

192
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:32,440
and preferences according to tech
novio market analysis, the global.

193
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:39,790
AI-based personalization market is
projected to grow by 7.43 USD billion

194
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:45,980
from 2025 to 2029 with a c year of 23%.

195
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:51,650
The growth reflects the transition
from rules rule-based personalization

196
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:56,240
to autonomous welding systems capable
of continuous self-improvement.

197
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,725
Next first one is like
anticipatory intelligence.

198
00:15:01,265 --> 00:15:06,485
The Medallia research shows organizations
implementing sophisticated forecasting

199
00:15:07,235 --> 00:15:12,435
achieve a 30% reduction acquisition cost
through precision targeting, efficiency,

200
00:15:12,735 --> 00:15:18,465
eliminating wasted expenditure on
low probability conversa conversions.

201
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:25,080
The financial services corporation
analyzes approximately $1.2 trillion

202
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,030
in annual transaction using models.

203
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:32,220
Incorporating 8,000 plus
variables per customer predicting

204
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,740
churn with 92% accuracy.

205
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:35,880
Eight.

206
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:41,265
Tele communications companies
implementation s 7,000 plus customer

207
00:15:41,265 --> 00:15:46,170
attributes in the real time through
attribute correlation discovery.

208
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:52,020
Identifying obvious relationship
between seemingly unrelated variables.

209
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:58,530
This increased camp time response
rates by 35% by addressing micro

210
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:04,200
movement perceptivity ly matching
efforts to psychological states

211
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,240
where customers are most receptive.

212
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,480
Value intelligence.

213
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:14,445
The lifetime value forecasting enables
pre organization through future value

214
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:20,085
projection, allocating resources based on
potential, rather that historical value.

215
00:16:20,475 --> 00:16:27,465
So companies implementing AI driven CLB
forecasting achieve a 25% increase in high

216
00:16:27,465 --> 00:16:33,135
value tension through precision investment
allocation, optimizing resources

217
00:16:33,195 --> 00:16:35,505
towards highest written relationships.

218
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:41,940
A coffeehouse company's platform
analyzes 400 plus billion data points

219
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,860
annually through consumption pattern
modeling, identifying subscale.

220
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,490
It signals that predict
spending trajectory.

221
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:57,420
This approach increased high value
retention by 15% by enabling preemptive

222
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:03,135
value protection, addressing satisfaction
risk before the impact behavior.

223
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:07,095
So the next one is
linguistic intelligence.

224
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:13,605
So the natural language processing
enables unprecedented customer

225
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:18,105
understanding through semantic
intent extraction, describing

226
00:17:18,165 --> 00:17:20,445
meaning beyond literal expression.

227
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:26,505
Organizations implementing NLP powered
personalization achieve 38% higher

228
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:31,350
satisfaction scores through conversational
context preservation preservation.

229
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:35,710
Maintaining understanding
across fragmented interaction.

230
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,360
Voice recognition systems enable
personalized experiences through

231
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:44,830
local identity verification,
authenticating users through unique

232
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:51,755
speech PLA patterns, a bank's voice
biometrics, authenticates 4.7 million

233
00:17:52,115 --> 00:17:57,810
customers monthly with 95% accuracy
through multifactor local analysis.

234
00:17:58,635 --> 00:18:02,595
Examining over a hundred speech
characteristics simultaneously.

235
00:18:02,745 --> 00:18:09,255
This reduce handling time by saving
$25 million annually through friction

236
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:15,345
minimized authentication, eliminating
cumbersome verification process.

237
00:18:16,335 --> 00:18:18,585
Next one, emotional intelligence.

238
00:18:18,885 --> 00:18:22,215
Sentiment detection systems
represents an emerging front

239
00:18:22,215 --> 00:18:23,870
tide through effective computing.

240
00:18:24,345 --> 00:18:28,635
So the technologies that recognize
and respond to human emotions,

241
00:18:29,085 --> 00:18:33,575
companies implementing emotion
detection achieve net prompter

242
00:18:33,575 --> 00:18:39,035
scores 18 points higher by addressing
emotional context misalignments,

243
00:18:39,365 --> 00:18:43,775
that disconnect between customer
emotional states and generic responses.

244
00:18:46,385 --> 00:18:48,960
Next privacy and ethical consideration.

245
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,720
As personalization capabilities
advanced or the organizations much

246
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,960
navigate the trust utility tension.

247
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,940
So the balancing enhanced experiences with
the privacy protection seven production,

248
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,515
75% of consumers express concern
about data usage with a 40% reporting

249
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,900
avoiding brands due to privacy issues.

250
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,530
The study identified the
personalization paradox.

251
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:22,200
Consumer simultaneously desired pilot
experiences while expressing anxiety

252
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,620
about the about the necessary data
collection, creating a fundamental

253
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,690
challenge for implementation.

254
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:34,430
So here the first two are, first
one is trust based governance.

255
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,900
The organization now.

256
00:19:36,665 --> 00:19:41,615
With the average of 5.2 distinct
privacy regulations with multinational

257
00:19:41,675 --> 00:19:45,785
enterprises navigating more
than 14 separate frameworks.

258
00:19:46,145 --> 00:19:51,965
This regulatory complexity has catalyzed
the concept of privacy by design

259
00:19:52,145 --> 00:19:56,495
and embedding protection mechanisms
into system architecture rather than

260
00:19:56,675 --> 00:19:59,465
applying them react retroactively.

261
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:07,129
So in the United States, so 70% of the
companies have restructured process

262
00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:12,560
for CCPA, CPRA through jurisdictional
personalization frameworks.

263
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:19,040
Geographically specific approach
organizations with prior to compliance

264
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,285
issue, 35% higher trust scores
transfer through transparency,

265
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:27,125
first design, prioritizing clear
communication about data practices.

266
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:30,705
The next one is geographic
privacy adoption.

267
00:20:31,035 --> 00:20:35,295
The regional compliance architecture
addresses international to via variation

268
00:20:35,295 --> 00:20:40,965
through regulatory localization, adopting
data practices to geographic requirements.

269
00:20:41,295 --> 00:20:48,475
According to George, mark mark, 68%
of global enterprise have implemented

270
00:20:48,504 --> 00:20:54,145
specific frameworks for different regions
and American technology companies app.

271
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,200
Tracking transparency fundamentally
altered the landscape with only

272
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,050
18% of users opting into tracking
this prompt of the customer goods

273
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:09,010
corporation to develop first party
data transformation strategies,

274
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:15,100
systematically replacing third party data
with consent tech direct relationships.

275
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:21,090
So the next ethical AI systems,
so explainable AI approaches

276
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,800
make decisions transfer.

277
00:21:23,805 --> 00:21:29,025
Interpretability mechanisms translating
complex algorithms decisions

278
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:31,365
into understandable explanations.

279
00:21:31,785 --> 00:21:36,465
So organizations implementing these
frameworks issue trust codes 50%

280
00:21:36,465 --> 00:21:39,885
higher than those with OPAC systems.

281
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:45,180
The bank developed narrative narrative
explanation, generation for recommendation

282
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:51,180
systems, increasing acceptance rates by
30% through comprehension gap resolution,

283
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,290
addressing customer uncertainty
about recommendation reasoning.

284
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:00,690
Their approach creates 18,000 plus
unique explanation combinations through

285
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:07,530
decision logic transition, converting
mathematical models into natural language.

286
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:13,260
I. So next inclusive design, the
organizations implementing formal

287
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:18,510
methodologists achieve the 40%
higher satisfaction among diverse

288
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:23,290
segment segments through demogra
demographic performance parity,

289
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,820
maintaining consists quality
regardless of user characteristics.

290
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:35,120
The LinkedIn fairness toolkit
reduce gender by asked by 12%

291
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,430
through counterfactual testing,
evaluating outcomes when only

292
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,290
protected characteristics, chance.

293
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:46,880
Their approach includes validation
across 27 dimensions, increasing

294
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:51,690
diverse applications rates through
accessibility, enhanced personalization,

295
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,010
adoptive experiences for users
with different abilities and needs.

296
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,860
Next, privacy preventing technologies.

297
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:06,500
So the organizations implementing
these techniques achieve 35% higher,

298
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:12,030
35% higher trust scores through
data minimization architecture.

299
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:16,390
So using only essential
information for specific purposes.

300
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,370
If finance purposes, if finance companies.

301
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:26,070
Differential privacy implementation,
reducing privacy risk by 70% while

302
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,480
maintaining recommendation ance
within 5% of non-private baseless

303
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,480
through privacy utility optimization.

304
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,220
Finding the ideal balance between
protection and personalization.

305
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,470
There are three methodologies.

306
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:46,380
Guiding adoption includes federal
learning, the 45% of organizations.

307
00:23:47,535 --> 00:23:50,595
Dis distributing computation
across devices to avoid

308
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,125
centralizing sensitive data.

309
00:23:54,645 --> 00:23:55,815
Differential privacy.

310
00:23:55,995 --> 00:24:00,675
These are 40% data of adoption,
adding calibrated noise to protect

311
00:24:00,675 --> 00:24:06,075
individuals while maintaining a
aggregate insights on device processing.

312
00:24:06,385 --> 00:24:08,305
Which is 60% adoption.

313
00:24:08,995 --> 00:24:12,625
So keeping personal data on
user devices through edge

314
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:16,195
computing personalization Next.

315
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,660
The ROM measurement and business impact.

316
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,630
So the quantifying the business
impact of ization requires the

317
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:29,970
attribution intelligence frameworks, so
sophisticated measurements, approaches

318
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,850
that isolate true value creation.

319
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,040
So according to according to apps
Flyer organization implementing

320
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:41,510
advanced frameworks achieve 35%
highend marketing our way through

321
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,700
signal isolation methodology.

322
00:24:43,985 --> 00:24:48,725
So distinguishing personalization effects
from background conversation noise, the

323
00:24:48,725 --> 00:24:55,565
customer journeys now span off average
of 7.3, touch points across 4.2 distinct

324
00:24:55,565 --> 00:25:01,445
cha distinct channels, creating what
experts term attribution complexity,

325
00:25:01,865 --> 00:25:06,425
the challenge of accurately crediting
influence across fragmented interactions.

326
00:25:07,155 --> 00:25:08,565
There is a different industries.

327
00:25:08,565 --> 00:25:10,425
We have several impact on this.

328
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,500
The first one is financial
services impacts.

329
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:18,900
So it has four 24% higher conversion
rights through targeted financial

330
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,780
product recommendations and
personalized financial guidance.

331
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:25,860
So the next for retail Go, if you
see the retail growth, so which is

332
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:30,760
increased, like 20% increased purchase,
got increased frequently frequency

333
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,290
through customer specific product
offerings and pilot shopping experiences.

334
00:25:36,145 --> 00:25:39,985
So if you, if we can see like
travel industry, so it increased

335
00:25:40,465 --> 00:25:46,105
25, 20 6% higher bookings values
through destination specific offers

336
00:25:46,105 --> 00:25:47,815
and personation travel packages.

337
00:25:48,355 --> 00:25:53,315
Then attribution attribution intelligence,
so that what was measurement frameworks

338
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:59,350
yield 35% or 35% higher marketing our
way through signal isolation methodology.

339
00:25:59,795 --> 00:26:03,635
So distinguishing personalization
effects from black room conversion noise.

340
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:08,110
So next the measurement
architecture models.

341
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:13,255
So here out of this, like the first
one is multidimensional attribution.

342
00:26:13,595 --> 00:26:18,030
So the multidimensional attribution
systems provide visibility into conversion

343
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:22,500
influences through touchpoint valuation,
modeling, assigning proportional

344
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,320
credit across customer journey stages.

345
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:29,850
BGS 2024, global Consumer
personalization Survey.

346
00:26:30,135 --> 00:26:34,365
Indicates organizations implementing
sophisticated attri attribution

347
00:26:34,365 --> 00:26:39,285
models achieved return 2.5 times
higher than basic approaches

348
00:26:39,285 --> 00:26:41,785
through casualty identification.

349
00:26:42,175 --> 00:26:47,650
So the dis distinction, correlation from
true influence, the multitask attribution

350
00:26:47,725 --> 00:26:53,725
frameworks enable friction conversion,
credit dividing value, cross contributing

351
00:26:53,815 --> 00:26:56,245
touchpoint based on influence magnitude.

352
00:26:56,785 --> 00:26:57,955
So this provides.

353
00:26:58,285 --> 00:27:02,185
Visibility into three times
more conversion influences than

354
00:27:02,185 --> 00:27:05,785
lost touch models by solving
the terminal bias problem.

355
00:27:06,395 --> 00:27:11,495
Overvaluing the final interaction
while ignoring earlier influences.

356
00:27:13,055 --> 00:27:16,415
So the next one, the casual
validation frameworks.

357
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:20,425
So incrementally the testing
incrementally incrementality testing

358
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:26,275
provides the rigorous validation through
control, experimentation, design.

359
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:32,605
The measuring lift again, as true
control groups, companies implementing

360
00:27:32,605 --> 00:27:37,580
systematic testing achieve RA
3.2 times higher than correlation

361
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,750
based measurement By addressing
attribution inflation incorrectly

362
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:45,895
climbing credit for conversation
conversions that would occur naturally.

363
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:51,890
A coffeehouse company conducts
more 400 incrementally incre

364
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,530
tests annually demonstrating.

365
00:27:55,355 --> 00:28:00,425
Personalized recommendations yield 2.5
x higher conversion rates contributing

366
00:28:00,765 --> 00:28:03,040
to a 5% increase in same store.

367
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:07,430
5% increase in the same store sales
through preference match discovery.

368
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:11,880
Connecting customers with our
previously previously unconsented

369
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:18,480
option organizations typically identify
that 25 per 25 to 38% of conversions.

370
00:28:18,805 --> 00:28:24,895
Previously contributed to marketing would
occur ar organically revealing significant

371
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:29,215
investment optimization opportunities
through more accurate measurements.

372
00:28:30,865 --> 00:28:35,055
Next the customer journey in
intelligence, the customer journeys

373
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:40,845
now span an average of 7.3 touch
points across 4.2 distinct channels.

374
00:28:41,235 --> 00:28:45,435
The creating what experts
term attribution complexity.

375
00:28:45,915 --> 00:28:49,415
The challenge of accurately
accurately creating influence

376
00:28:49,415 --> 00:28:51,365
across fragmented interactions.

377
00:28:51,755 --> 00:28:57,605
Organizations with comprehensive
measurement achieve outcomes 2.8 times

378
00:28:57,605 --> 00:29:00,335
higher than those with limited metrics.

379
00:29:00,665 --> 00:29:05,185
The generally analytics frameworks,
the gene based gene based attribution

380
00:29:05,185 --> 00:29:09,890
identifies 28% more conversion
influences than traditional models by

381
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,775
solving the interaction F blindness.

382
00:29:13,075 --> 00:29:17,005
Failing to recognize how touch
points amplify each other.

383
00:29:17,995 --> 00:29:22,285
An insurance company tracks over
eight 50 distinct journey patterns,

384
00:29:22,345 --> 00:29:26,525
increasing personalized comp com
completion rates by 25% through

385
00:29:26,705 --> 00:29:31,430
friction point personalization, the
targeting interventions at abundant pr.

386
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:37,190
Organizations with comprehensive
measurements achieve outcomes 2.8

387
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:42,830
times higher than those who limited
metrics through holistic impact

388
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:47,025
visibility, understanding effects
beyond immediate immediate conversion.

389
00:29:48,355 --> 00:29:53,325
Next the relationship value architecture,
so the customer lifetime value, if

390
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:57,895
frameworks measures long-term impact
through relationship durability modeling

391
00:29:58,275 --> 00:30:03,465
quantifying how the personalization
sentence the customer connections BCG

392
00:30:03,495 --> 00:30:09,045
found that eight 68% of consumers develop
stronger brand loyalty when receiving

393
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:14,135
consistently personalized experiences
with 60% willing to pay premium prices.

394
00:30:14,525 --> 00:30:18,875
Relationship impact presents the most
significant value driver with the

395
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:23,915
long-term loyalty, contributing 2.3
times more lifetime value than initial

396
00:30:23,915 --> 00:30:28,295
conversation improvements through
compounding preference, satisfaction,

397
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:33,465
where each positive personalized
interaction increases future receptivity.

398
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,860
A beauty retailer measures 19 distinct
relationship metrics, increasing

399
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,250
customer return retention by 24%
through loyalty, trigger identification,

400
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,625
pinpointing specific personalization
element that strengthen relationships.

401
00:30:48,795 --> 00:30:51,804
The next organization
enable implement systems.

402
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:55,284

00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:32,434
Precisely targeting the points
within complex per processes.

413
00:31:32,734 --> 00:31:40,174
Customers with hyper personal experiences
demonstrates 2.2 x higher net pro prompter

414
00:31:40,204 --> 00:31:45,009
scores through x. Expectation, experience,
alignment, closing gaps between

415
00:31:45,329 --> 00:31:47,844
customer hopes and actual experiences.

416
00:31:49,314 --> 00:31:53,894
So then see next we can see like how
the future of hyper personalization.

417
00:31:54,794 --> 00:31:59,334
So it has a two point five x returns for
organizations who, with the sophisticated

418
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:05,214
attribution models and the 35% higher RY
through at once attribution frameworks.

419
00:32:05,544 --> 00:32:09,864
And a 22% revenue uplift average
across customer lifecycle.

420
00:32:10,284 --> 00:32:14,304
So the hyper personation has
emerged as a critical competitive

421
00:32:14,634 --> 00:32:17,034
differentiator across industries.

422
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:21,004

Navigate the complex balance
between enhanced experiences

426
00:32:32,714 --> 00:32:34,184
and privacy considerations.

427
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:37,484
Those implementing comprehensive
attribution frameworks,

428
00:32:37,934 --> 00:32:41,054
ethical AI governance, and
the specialized organization

429
00:32:41,054 --> 00:32:43,029
structures demonstrate superior.

430
00:32:44,104 --> 00:32:45,154
Venous outcomes.

431
00:32:45,304 --> 00:32:49,984
So moving forward, the hyper robustness
will continue evolving toward AM means

432
00:32:49,984 --> 00:32:53,854
indigenous with privacy, preserving
technologies and cross-functional

The multi-factor value creation mechanisms
underlying successful implementation

441
00:33:27,374 --> 00:33:31,934
from real-time data orchestration
to relationship durability modeling.

442
00:33:32,459 --> 00:33:37,589
As organizations navigate the complex
balance between enhanced experiences and

443
00:33:37,589 --> 00:33:43,229
privacy considerations, those implementing
comprehensive attribution frameworks

444
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:48,689
framework ethical AI governance and
specialized organization structures,
