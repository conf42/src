1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,840
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,230
I'm thrilled to be part of conf 32.

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,300
I have to the chance to share my
insights of one of the most exciting

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,729
insertion of creativity and technology.

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,889
Algorithmic arts using JavaScript.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,400
This conference brings together
people passionate about tech,

7
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:17,779
and I hope you will join me.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,669
By the end of this session, you'll
see how JavaScript is not only a tool

9
00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:27,040
for development, but also a medium
of artistic expression as well.

10
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:30,320
Let's drive into this journey
together and explore a fascinating

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,889
world of, we're called, because

12
00:00:33,389 --> 00:00:35,529
Think back to when you were a child.

13
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,289
Remember how naturally
drawing came to you?

14
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:44,339
However, it was doodles in the margins of
your school notebook, crayons on paper,

15
00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:47,519
or even drawing in the sand at the beach.

16
00:00:48,099 --> 00:00:50,339
What did your drawing
mean to you back then?

17
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:53,279
For many of us, drawing
as a child was our life.

18
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:57,579
About pure creativity, a way to
express ourselves without worrying

19
00:00:57,649 --> 00:00:59,869
about rules or being judged.

20
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:03,379
It was about exploring
our imagination freely.

21
00:01:03,779 --> 00:01:07,779
But as we grow older,
many of us stop drawing.

22
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:09,069
Why is that?

23
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,959
Does the fear of impression creep in?

24
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:16,059
Do we become too focused
on what others think?

25
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:20,819
Today, I want to invite you to
reconnect with that creativity freedom.

26
00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:24,169
It's time to use the power of code.

27
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:28,619
The table of contents, what I
want to talk with you today.

28
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:30,339
Get to know me.

29
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:35,329
I'll start sharing a bit about
myself, who I am, what brought me to

30
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:39,189
this point, and why I'm passionate
about both technology and art.

31
00:01:39,669 --> 00:01:42,929
This will give you a sense of
perspective I'm bringing to the table.

32
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:45,559
Understanding algorithmic art.

33
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:50,349
Next, we'll drive into
what algorithmic art is.

34
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:54,829
I'll explain how algorithmic creative
coding come together to form an

35
00:01:54,889 --> 00:02:00,129
unique blend of art and technology,
and how this field is transforming

36
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:02,169
the way we think about creativity.

37
00:02:03,169 --> 00:02:05,729
Exploring JavaScript for creative coding.

38
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:09,839
After that, I introduce you a
powerful JavaScript library.

39
00:02:10,084 --> 00:02:10,624
P5.

40
00:02:10,754 --> 00:02:15,534
js that you can use to start
creating algorithmic art by yourself.

41
00:02:16,004 --> 00:02:20,054
You'll see how tool enables artists
and coders alike to experiment

42
00:02:20,054 --> 00:02:21,494
with visual interactions.

43
00:02:22,274 --> 00:02:24,164
Resources for experimentations.

44
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:28,484
I also share some great resources
where you can experiment with

45
00:02:28,504 --> 00:02:33,074
team learning including platforms
like Open Processing that offers

46
00:02:33,134 --> 00:02:37,584
inspirations, tutorials, and examples
from the creative coding community.

47
00:02:38,084 --> 00:02:39,004
Conclusions and reflections.

48
00:02:39,504 --> 00:02:44,684
As we near the end of the talk, I offer
some deep reflection of how algorithmic

49
00:02:44,754 --> 00:02:49,904
art challenge our traditional ideas of
art, and how you can incorporate this

50
00:02:49,914 --> 00:02:53,454
from of creativity into your own projects.

51
00:02:53,944 --> 00:02:58,114
And finally, I'll provide my list of
reference so you can explore these topics

52
00:02:58,354 --> 00:03:01,104
further and see the sources that you need.

53
00:03:02,074 --> 00:03:04,614
begin the concept and
ideas was discussed today.

54
00:03:05,114 --> 00:03:09,824
I'm Francisca Beatriz Medina Gonza, and
you can find me on my social networks.

55
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:14,184
On LinkedIn, I'm listed by my full
name, Francisca Beatriz Medina Gonza.

56
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:18,224
But if you prefer Instagram,
you can find me at franny.

57
00:03:18,224 --> 00:03:19,334
b, franny.

58
00:03:19,334 --> 00:03:20,324
b.

59
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,444
Instagram is my platform.

60
00:03:23,764 --> 00:03:28,444
So if you happen to take photos,
screenshot, or whatever during the session

61
00:03:28,494 --> 00:03:32,514
or while experiment with algorithmic
art, I really appreciate if you tag me.

62
00:03:32,854 --> 00:03:36,894
It's always great to stay connected
and share our creative journeys.

63
00:03:37,394 --> 00:03:38,154
My roles.

64
00:03:38,654 --> 00:03:43,074
I'm currently role as UX and front
end leader at LATAM Airlines.

65
00:03:43,414 --> 00:03:47,954
I'm responsible for overseeing the
design and development of user interface

66
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:49,784
with our data visualization team.

67
00:03:49,784 --> 00:03:49,874
Thank you.

68
00:03:50,374 --> 00:03:55,144
As a speaker, I have the opportunity to
share my knowledge, passion for technology

69
00:03:55,214 --> 00:03:57,064
at conferences like GSCom Chile.

70
00:03:58,044 --> 00:04:02,364
As a volunteer for Women Techmakers,
I support initiatives that empower

71
00:04:02,364 --> 00:04:06,494
women in technology through mentorship,
education, and community building.

72
00:04:06,994 --> 00:04:09,834
Let me tell you a bit more about who I am.

73
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:14,629
I'm a variety career designer, web
developer, teacher, and now leader.

74
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:19,529
But beyond the tech, I always love
making art and craft with my hands.

75
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:21,319
no, I'm definitely not a robot.

76
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:27,389
I'm cute, emotional person who finds joy
in creative, both digital and physical.

77
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:32,489
I'm from Santiago de Chile, and while
Santiago is our capital, it's important

78
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:34,399
to know that Santiago is not Chile.

79
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:39,234
Chile is a long and diverse country
with so much to offer beyond this.

80
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:42,624
For those who are wondering,
where exactly Chile?

81
00:04:42,984 --> 00:04:47,574
we are the southernmost country
in the world, stretching all

82
00:04:47,574 --> 00:04:49,834
the way down to Antarctica.

83
00:04:49,974 --> 00:04:55,554
We speak Spanish, so I want to apologize
in advance if my English is not perfect.

84
00:04:56,484 --> 00:04:59,474
Thank you for understanding as
I present this talk in Spanish.

85
00:04:59,654 --> 00:05:01,294
is my second language.

86
00:05:01,794 --> 00:05:03,154
Personal motivation.

87
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:08,494
My personal journey into the world of art
and technology started in a childhood.

88
00:05:09,114 --> 00:05:13,294
I was a shy kid who loved art and
dreamed of becoming an artist.

89
00:05:13,964 --> 00:05:16,724
That passion led me to study
design at the university.

90
00:05:17,194 --> 00:05:20,794
But during my time at the
university, I had a crisis.

91
00:05:20,884 --> 00:05:25,784
I started to feel like maybe this was
Then I discovered web development,

92
00:05:26,014 --> 00:05:30,454
which rekindled my childhood love
of creative and building things.

93
00:05:31,024 --> 00:05:35,644
That turned me on to my course called
Creative Programming for Design.

94
00:05:36,164 --> 00:05:39,804
I became a teaching assistant
in that class, inspired by one

95
00:05:39,804 --> 00:05:42,194
of my professors, Ricardo Vega.

96
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:44,864
So this talk is for you, Ricardo.

97
00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:48,344
Through this journey, I made
amazing connections, like my

98
00:05:48,344 --> 00:05:52,664
friend Valentina Gaete, who was
one of the students in that class.

99
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:57,154
Vale went in to pursue a
master's degree in Germany.

100
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:01,419
And she always tell me that
this class changes her life.

101
00:06:02,109 --> 00:06:07,149
My own preliminary thesis at draft was
about algorithmic logos, which sparked my

102
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:09,429
interest in merging art and technology.

103
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:14,249
Now, as a professor, I strive my
students the same inspiration and

104
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:15,639
opportunities that I received.

105
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,259
I'm not currently in a full creative role.

106
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:22,219
My goal is to bring creativity back
to my work and help the students

107
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:26,439
to involve technology to open
up opportunities for themselves.

108
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:30,829
My journey to where I am has
not been any fun by linear.

109
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:35,439
When I start, I didn't imagine I
will become a team leader, a speaker

110
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:39,659
at conference like this, or even a
volunteer in per woman and girls in tech.

111
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:44,039
In fact, for a long time, I was
show an introverted person too

112
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,529
afraid to speak up or take On
challenge that feels beyond my reach.

113
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:54,229
I use it to see leadership in and public
speaking as Things other people did.

114
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:58,499
People were naturally outgoing and
confident, not someone like me.

115
00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:03,369
But everything began to change when
I realized that growing comes from

116
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,319
stepping outside the comfort zone.

117
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:10,119
My roles today, whether team leader,
mentorship, or giving talks, didn't come

118
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:12,619
because I had everything to figure it out.

119
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,549
They became, I took risks and
pressed filters, and learned.

120
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:18,979
to trust my own voice.

121
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:23,399
Along the way, I discovered incredible
satisfaction of helping others,

122
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,859
especially women in tech, to find
their place in a world that often

123
00:07:27,859 --> 00:07:30,179
feel like it's not made for us.

124
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,329
That's why I became a volunteer and
a speaker to share what I've learned

125
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:36,959
and help others on their own journeys.

126
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:44,639
This sack is part of that mission to
spear You to see how your own potential.

127
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:46,729
So let's start with the basic.

128
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:48,489
What is an algorithm?

129
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,239
I'm sure that most of you have
come across this term, but let me

130
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:55,049
sure we are all in the same page.

131
00:07:55,549 --> 00:08:00,949
An algorithm is essential, a set of
instructions, a step by step process,

132
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:04,399
solving a problem or performing a task.

133
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:06,349
It's like a receipt of cake.

134
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,949
There are specific steps to follow
to reach the desired outcome.

135
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,469
In the world of programming.

136
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:18,199
Algorithms are what make computers
capable of performing complex operations.

137
00:08:19,049 --> 00:08:24,869
Whether you realize it or not, algorithms
are everywhere, from recommending

138
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:29,719
what video you should watch next to
controlling traffic lights, And even

139
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:32,449
in the art we are about to create.

140
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:35,469
Now, there's a, here's a big question.

141
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:37,219
What is art?

142
00:08:37,619 --> 00:08:41,369
Definitive art is something
philosophers and artists have

143
00:08:41,369 --> 00:08:43,859
been debating for centuries.

144
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,409
And there's no answer.

145
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:48,749
For some, art is about
beauty and aesthetics.

146
00:08:48,979 --> 00:08:49,959
For others, it's art.

147
00:08:50,274 --> 00:08:54,494
About emotion or making a
statement, art can be way of

148
00:08:54,494 --> 00:08:59,394
seeing the world of expression,
something that world can capture.

149
00:09:00,184 --> 00:09:06,304
Here's are some aspect to consider
creative expression, aesthetic value,

150
00:09:06,744 --> 00:09:12,274
mediums and forms, interpretation
and perception in innovation and

151
00:09:12,274 --> 00:09:15,084
tradition and cultural significance.

152
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:18,874
The way we create and experiment art.

153
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:24,789
As involved dramatic in the recent years,
with the risk of digital technology,

154
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:29,929
art now have access to tools that
previous generations could have imagined.

155
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:34,579
Today, art is confined to a paint
or canvas or sculpted in marble.

156
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:39,179
It's pixels, code, and
even virtual spaces.

157
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:44,529
Digital art allows to blend
mediums to collaborate in ways

158
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:47,589
that were never possible before.

159
00:09:48,369 --> 00:09:53,273
The boundaries between art, design, and
technology have become increasingly fluid.

160
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:56,789
And algorithmic art is a
perfect example of that.

161
00:09:57,049 --> 00:10:00,859
This new frontier where
creative meets competition.

162
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:05,729
Algorithmic art represents a unique form
or artistic expression where technology

163
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:10,009
and programming play a fundamental
role in the creation of the work.

164
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:16,059
This type of art is notable for its
ability to transform algorithmic art and

165
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:20,599
data into visual and sensory experiences,
often challenging or traditional.

166
00:10:21,099 --> 00:10:22,269
Perception of art.

167
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:27,019
Algorithmic arts is a perfect example
of how art and technology can merge in

168
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:29,329
a way that is both precise and poetic.

169
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:33,154
It learns the computing power of
computers to create pieces of art.

170
00:10:33,554 --> 00:10:40,064
That would be impossible or last
extremely time consuming to make by hand.

171
00:10:40,604 --> 00:10:44,944
Artists know as algorithms,
used to code design algorithms

172
00:10:44,984 --> 00:10:47,016
that generate visual works.

173
00:10:47,016 --> 00:10:52,644
This algorithm can produce intricate
patterns, complex geometries, or

174
00:10:52,674 --> 00:10:54,604
even simulation of natural process.

175
00:10:55,084 --> 00:11:00,879
And the beauty lies in the fact that
Often, no two outputs are the same.

176
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:05,629
The art evolves based on the algorithm,
logic, input, and randomness.

177
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:09,839
This art pushes the boundaries of
what traditional thinks, of acts,

178
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,134
creative, offering, and so on.

179
00:11:11,474 --> 00:11:14,534
new ways to explore and express ideas.

180
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:19,894
An algorist is an artist
who use algorithms as part

181
00:11:19,944 --> 00:11:21,944
of the creative process.

182
00:11:22,244 --> 00:11:25,104
But begin an algorithm is
more than just write code.

183
00:11:25,424 --> 00:11:29,114
It's about seeing code
as a tool of expression.

184
00:11:29,474 --> 00:11:34,974
For this artist, algorithm becomes
the paint brushes and the computer

185
00:11:34,974 --> 00:11:40,314
screen They use code to generate art,
creating everything from abstract

186
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:42,514
design to interact visualization.

187
00:11:43,144 --> 00:11:47,314
An algorithm doesn't just
program for function.

188
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:52,174
They program for beating meaning,
embracing the unpredictable impression

189
00:11:52,204 --> 00:11:53,914
that becomes with algorithmic design.

190
00:11:54,414 --> 00:12:00,524
In September 1995, the term algorithm was
coined by the artist Jean Pierre Herbert.

191
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:04,294
He wanted to describe artists
who use algorithms as the

192
00:12:04,314 --> 00:12:06,884
primitive tool for creating art.

193
00:12:07,354 --> 00:12:09,414
At the time, it was a new concept.

194
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:10,759
Combine the world into one.

195
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:15,959
For a fine art with the pressure of
computer science, Herbert and others in

196
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:21,419
the field recognized that algorithms could
do more than solve mathematical problems.

197
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:25,869
They could be used to explore
creative in neodymamic ways.

198
00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:32,069
His work set a stage for the explosion
of digital art that we're seeing today,

199
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:37,649
and the term algorithm has become to
symbolize the fusion of these two worlds.

200
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:38,649
Now.

201
00:12:38,874 --> 00:12:44,074
We have JavaScript, JavaScript is
the one of the most versatile and

202
00:12:44,074 --> 00:12:45,774
widely used programming language.

203
00:12:45,804 --> 00:12:49,814
Today, Origin created for
adding interactive to website.

204
00:12:50,004 --> 00:12:52,624
It had grown for far beyond that.

205
00:12:53,604 --> 00:12:56,874
JavaScript now powers everything
from the web app service.

206
00:12:56,914 --> 00:12:58,794
And yes, it's even because powerful.

207
00:12:59,294 --> 00:13:01,134
Told for creating art.

208
00:13:01,624 --> 00:13:05,234
What makes JavaScript special
for our purpose is flexibility.

209
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:12,294
It's accessible enough for beginners
to pick up quickly, but powerful from

210
00:13:12,614 --> 00:13:15,174
enough for complex artist projects.

211
00:13:15,674 --> 00:13:20,154
JavaScript is an incredibly
powerful language, but what

212
00:13:20,154 --> 00:13:23,464
makes it even more versatile is
the vast ecosystem of libraries.

213
00:13:23,964 --> 00:13:25,454
There are libraries for everything.

214
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:31,094
Let's say you work on a website, you
go to libraries like React or Vue to

215
00:13:31,094 --> 00:13:35,504
build dynamic user interface, need to
make, manage massive amounts of data.

216
00:13:35,604 --> 00:13:40,644
there's D3JS for data visualization
or libraries like Loudish for

217
00:13:40,644 --> 00:13:42,554
simple complex data manipulation.

218
00:13:42,964 --> 00:13:44,104
Want to animate?

219
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:45,154
GreenScogs.

220
00:13:45,214 --> 00:13:50,384
has you covered for six Even if you
need to handle something mundane

221
00:13:50,674 --> 00:13:54,174
as date and times, don't worry,
there's moment, yes, to help you out.

222
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,964
We even have libraries for libraries.

223
00:13:57,234 --> 00:14:02,294
Tools like Webfar or Babel exist to
optimize and bundle all your code

224
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:04,754
together, making everything run smoother.

225
00:14:05,604 --> 00:14:10,114
So yes, JavaScript developers often joke
that if there's a problem, there's a

226
00:14:10,134 --> 00:14:12,534
probably already a library to solve it.

227
00:14:13,344 --> 00:14:14,594
But what about art?

228
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:18,349
Yes, even for creating
art there are libraries.

229
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:22,019
Today we'll focus on one of those, p5.

230
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:22,639
js.

231
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,949
This library was specifically designed
to bring the power of coding into

232
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,929
the hands of artistic and creatives.

233
00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:33,349
Whenever you design art, Interactive
visuals generate patterns of something

234
00:14:33,349 --> 00:14:35,419
complex, completely unexpected.

235
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:36,129
P5.

236
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:40,819
js unlocks a world of artistic
possibilities through code.

237
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:41,109
P5.

238
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:47,119
js is a fantastic library created by
Lauren McCartney, and it was designed

239
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,244
to make coding accessible to us.

240
00:14:49,754 --> 00:14:53,859
Artists, designers, educators, and
anyone interested in the creative coding.

241
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:57,594
Lauren's vision was to make a
tool that allows people to create

242
00:14:57,654 --> 00:15:02,314
visual art with code without
needing to be an expert programmer.

243
00:15:03,164 --> 00:15:07,564
It's built on the top of processing, a
popular framework used by creative coders.

244
00:15:08,064 --> 00:15:11,874
And it brings all of the power
into the JavaScript ecosystem.

245
00:15:12,374 --> 00:15:14,494
There's a story of P5.

246
00:15:14,504 --> 00:15:15,134
Yes.

247
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:18,964
2001 processing was developed
by Cassy Rian, an artist and

248
00:15:18,964 --> 00:15:20,789
verified data scientists.

249
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:23,474
In 2001, Cassy Rias and Ben Fried.

250
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:28,054
Both students at the MIT
Media Lab create Processing.

251
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:33,144
Their goal was to develop a software
sketchbook and a language that

252
00:15:33,344 --> 00:15:37,594
would serve the electronic art
and visual design communities.

253
00:15:37,674 --> 00:15:41,524
Processing was designed to be an
easy to use language for artists and

254
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:46,254
designers, convening visual programming
environment with a simple syntax to

255
00:15:46,254 --> 00:15:48,204
encourage experimentation and creativity.

256
00:15:48,204 --> 00:15:51,614
In 2008, Processing.

257
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,874
js was developed by John Reesing.

258
00:15:54,094 --> 00:15:54,694
a programmer.

259
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:59,464
In 2008, John Risen, known for
his work on jQuery, developed

260
00:16:00,034 --> 00:16:01,454
the developer Processing.

261
00:16:01,454 --> 00:16:01,814
js.

262
00:16:02,324 --> 00:16:05,884
This was a JavaScript port for
processing, allowing processing

263
00:16:05,884 --> 00:16:10,894
code to run natively in web browsers
without the need for Java plugins.

264
00:16:11,424 --> 00:16:11,764
Processing.

265
00:16:11,774 --> 00:16:15,724
js made it easier to integrate
processing sketches into the web

266
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:19,594
page and brought the capabilities
of processing to a broader audience.

267
00:16:20,094 --> 00:16:23,174
in 2013, P five was developed.

268
00:16:23,174 --> 00:16:27,914
Vale Laura McCarty, artist and
programmer Laura McCarty developed P 5G.

269
00:16:27,914 --> 00:16:32,984
SP five GS is a JavaScript leverage
that aim to make coding accessible for

270
00:16:32,984 --> 00:16:35,414
artists, sinus education and beginners it.

271
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:40,979
It's a repertation of processing for
the web with a focus on making code

272
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:43,009
more approachable and inclusive.

273
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:45,419
McCartney works on p5.

274
00:16:45,489 --> 00:16:47,589
js, empathizes,
interactive and creativity.

275
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:50,509
Building on legacy of processing.

276
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:53,139
Will leverage modern web technologies.

277
00:16:53,639 --> 00:17:00,479
Between 2014 and 2015, some Java and
processing updates make it difficult

278
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:03,289
for processing JS to remain used.

279
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:07,919
Between these days, updates to Java and
processing itself create incompatibilities

280
00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:10,819
which uses for processing JS.

281
00:17:11,389 --> 00:17:15,479
These updates make it challenging
to maintain and use processing

282
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:17,519
JS, leading to a decline in Java.

283
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:23,279
As the community began to shift
towards more robust solutions like p5.

284
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:26,274
js, which were better suited
to develop the solution.

285
00:17:26,524 --> 00:17:28,734
To evolving web environments.

286
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:32,994
Processing JS stopped
active development in 2016.

287
00:17:33,494 --> 00:17:37,280
By 2016, active development
of processing has changed.

288
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,834
The community and developers
recognize that P5.

289
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:45,354
js was more viable option for web
based provisional programming.

290
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:45,574
P5.

291
00:17:45,574 --> 00:17:50,544
js provides a more modern and
versatile platform, prompting the

292
00:17:50,544 --> 00:17:54,534
focus to shift and turn it towards
its development and support.

293
00:17:55,034 --> 00:18:01,084
In 2018, the PFGS online
editor was launched.

294
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:07,454
Online editor made it even easier
for users to start coding with PFGS

295
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:09,974
without needing to start any software.

296
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:13,814
The editor provides a user friendly
interface, fostering a collaborative

297
00:18:13,904 --> 00:18:17,414
and accessible environment
to learn and creative coding.

298
00:18:17,544 --> 00:18:22,120
It became a significant resource for
educators and learners worldwide.

299
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,324
In 2020, Both Processing and P5.

300
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:28,124
js continue to be actively
used in development.

301
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:32,494
Processing continues to evolve
as a powerful tool for creating

302
00:18:32,494 --> 00:18:34,804
code in Java, while P5.

303
00:18:34,804 --> 00:18:38,484
js thrives as its JavaScript
counterpart for web based projects.

304
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:42,754
The ongoing development of both
platforms ensures that they remain

305
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:46,894
a valuable resource for artists,
designers, and programmers.

306
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:51,264
What are the differences
between Processing and P5?

307
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:56,184
Processing was based in
Java with its own IDE.

308
00:18:57,014 --> 00:18:58,974
What are its strengths?

309
00:18:59,184 --> 00:18:59,984
It's easy to use.

310
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:03,114
Designed for artists and non
programmers, Processing has a

311
00:19:03,114 --> 00:19:05,024
simple syntax that is easy to learn.

312
00:19:05,524 --> 00:19:13,424
Performance as a Java based platform,
Processing often offers better performance

313
00:19:13,434 --> 00:19:15,914
for more computationally intensive talks.

314
00:19:16,414 --> 00:19:17,674
Community and libraries.

315
00:19:17,714 --> 00:19:21,214
Processing has a large community
and many libraries available for

316
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:24,114
tasks such as computer vision,
data visualization, and more.

317
00:19:24,614 --> 00:19:25,724
Desktop applications.

318
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:29,194
Great for creating stand alone desktop
applications and installations.

319
00:19:29,694 --> 00:19:31,874
What are its weaknesses?

320
00:19:32,564 --> 00:19:33,534
Web integration.

321
00:19:34,034 --> 00:19:39,344
Web integration, less straight off to
integrate with technology compared to p5.

322
00:19:39,404 --> 00:19:39,784
js.

323
00:19:40,284 --> 00:19:45,504
Processing is somewhat insulate
from modern JavaScript ecosystem,

324
00:19:45,574 --> 00:19:48,094
which include powerful tools and
libraries for web development.

325
00:19:48,094 --> 00:19:48,504
p5.

326
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:54,979
js P5GS is a JavaScript library
often used with web based IDE

327
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:56,949
or integrated into web projects.

328
00:19:57,449 --> 00:19:58,889
What are its strengths?

329
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:00,399
Web integration.

330
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:06,019
P5GS is designed to work seamlessly
with web technologies, making it ideal

331
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:07,849
for interactive web based projects.

Accessibility.

333
00:20:09,469 --> 00:20:13,134
Since it's run in the browser,
P5GS projects are easily

334
00:20:13,134 --> 00:20:15,529
accessible and shareable via URL.

335
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:16,739
Leverage.

336
00:20:16,739 --> 00:20:16,789
P5GS.

337
00:20:16,974 --> 00:20:20,474
The power of modern JavaScript
ecosystem, including tools, library and

338
00:20:20,474 --> 00:20:22,304
frameworks like React, Vue and D3JS.

339
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:26,674
Learning resources, extensive
documentation and tutorial, practical

340
00:20:26,674 --> 00:20:31,684
and suitable for Beginners learning
coded through creative problem, weakness.

341
00:20:32,124 --> 00:20:33,964
As a JavaScript library, P5.

342
00:20:33,964 --> 00:20:39,354
js might not perform as well as processing
for more computational intensive tasks.

343
00:20:39,854 --> 00:20:42,614
Creating a standalone desktop
application can be more

344
00:20:42,614 --> 00:20:44,424
complex compared to processing.

345
00:20:44,924 --> 00:20:46,054
With P5.

346
00:20:46,054 --> 00:20:50,204
js, you are still using
the same JavaScript basics.

347
00:20:50,914 --> 00:20:53,664
Functions, variables, loops, and logic.

348
00:20:54,314 --> 00:20:56,554
Just like any other program.

349
00:20:57,074 --> 00:20:58,384
But there's an exception.

350
00:20:58,784 --> 00:21:00,044
exciting part.

351
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:05,894
Instead of outputting data or perform
calculation, you're creating visual

352
00:21:05,954 --> 00:21:08,164
experience directly on canvas.

353
00:21:08,504 --> 00:21:09,894
When you use V5.

354
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:15,104
js, it generates an HTML file
with a canvas element and that

355
00:21:15,114 --> 00:21:17,354
canvas becomes your virtual paper.

356
00:21:17,854 --> 00:21:22,404
Everything you draw, animate, or
interact with happens inside this canvas,

357
00:21:22,784 --> 00:21:24,719
allowing you to bring your code to life.

358
00:21:25,459 --> 00:21:27,319
To life in a visual way.

359
00:21:28,229 --> 00:21:31,939
Functions like set up and
draw are essential in define

360
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,029
what appears on the compass.

361
00:21:34,229 --> 00:21:39,159
Set up runs once like setting this
and draw is where the action happens.

362
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:43,479
It's like the function that gets called
continuously to create animation or

363
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:46,059
update your visual frame by frame.

364
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,189
Essentially every line of code you write
is an instruction for what gets to draw.

365
00:21:51,854 --> 00:21:56,434
Onto that canvas, making coded,
direct and creative process.

366
00:21:56,934 --> 00:22:03,024
Let's take a look at this template for the
PFGS website that creates a star shape.

367
00:22:03,774 --> 00:22:08,334
The beauty of this code
is in its simplicity.

368
00:22:08,634 --> 00:22:13,504
It uses basic geometric principles and
loops to generate points of a star.

369
00:22:14,004 --> 00:22:15,554
Placing each vertex with.

370
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:18,219
Precise mathematical accuracy.

371
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:22,989
By routing and scale, you can create
a pattern that feels both calculated

372
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:24,799
and organic at the same time.

373
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:30,729
What's powerful here is that just
a few lines of code can produce

374
00:22:30,739 --> 00:22:32,369
something visually striking.

375
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:35,699
One of the most exciting aspects of p5.

376
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:38,869
js is the ability to create
interactive experience.

377
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:45,484
With just a few lines of code, You can
make your artwork respond to user input.

378
00:22:45,984 --> 00:22:50,094
Whatever is through the mouse,
keyboard, or even the sound.

379
00:22:50,634 --> 00:22:54,494
For example, you can track the
position of the mouse and use that

380
00:22:54,534 --> 00:22:58,634
data to move elements on the canvas
or change colors dynamically.

381
00:22:59,264 --> 00:23:03,434
Imagine Creative a painting that
reacts to where you click or draw

382
00:23:03,664 --> 00:23:04,924
your mouse across the screen.

383
00:23:05,324 --> 00:23:05,644
With P5.

384
00:23:05,954 --> 00:23:10,704
js, interaction is as simple as
using built in functions like MUSE.

385
00:23:10,914 --> 00:23:16,014
X and Muse I to detect the position
of the mouse or key press it to

386
00:23:16,064 --> 00:23:18,114
respond to the keyboard inputs.

387
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:22,594
You can even incorporate audio input
to visually sound waves or create

388
00:23:22,654 --> 00:23:24,804
artwork that reacts to external sounds.

389
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:30,489
The potential for creation is
limitless, making your audience

390
00:23:30,529 --> 00:23:32,479
a part of creative process.

391
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:36,599
P5GS is particular with suit
for creating geometric patterns,

392
00:23:37,009 --> 00:23:40,689
which are often visually captivity
and mathematical presses.

393
00:23:40,949 --> 00:23:44,299
By convening shapes like circles,
squares and triangles with loops

394
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:48,519
and transformations, you can create
intricate designs that will be

395
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:50,459
incredibly difficult to write by hand.

396
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:55,159
Whether it's still in patterns, mandalas,
or optical illusion, the presence of

397
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:59,489
the computer allows you to play with
symmetry, repetition, and scale in a

398
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:02,049
way that results in measurable visuals.

399
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:06,409
And because you are working with
code, you can easily tweak parameters

400
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:11,224
like size, color, or rotation for
of elements to explore endless

401
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,314
variations of the same pattern.

402
00:24:13,814 --> 00:24:17,724
Fractals and interactive
systems are another fascinating

403
00:24:17,794 --> 00:24:18,964
area to explore with P5GS.

404
00:24:18,964 --> 00:24:25,853
These are patterns that repeat themselves
at different scales, often resulting in

405
00:24:25,853 --> 00:24:28,723
highly detailed and complex structures.

406
00:24:28,723 --> 00:24:35,004
A classic example is the Mandelbrot
set or the Sierpinski triangle.

407
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:41,189
With P five GS, you can use recursion
where a function calls itself to

408
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:46,349
generate fractals that reveal infinite
complexity as you zone in or out.

409
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:50,549
These fractal designs are not only
beautiful, but also demonstrate the power

410
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:53,419
of mathematical and in creating art.

411
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,669
Data visualization is another
exciting application of 5GS.

412
00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:03,829
Data visualization is another
exciting application of P5GS.

413
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:08,299
By mapping data to visual elements like
shape, color, and size, you can create

414
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:12,319
visual representations of complete
datasets that are easy to understand.

415
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:17,189
Wherever you're working with scientific
data, social media metrics, or any

416
00:25:17,189 --> 00:25:23,064
type of your information, P5GS can help
you turn that numbers into visuals.

417
00:25:23,284 --> 00:25:27,584
For example, you can create by bar
charts, scatter plots, or even abstract

418
00:25:27,794 --> 00:25:32,574
visualization where data points become
a part of larger artistic composition.

419
00:25:33,154 --> 00:25:38,654
This approach not only makes data
more engaging, but also allows you to

420
00:25:38,654 --> 00:25:41,204
tell story with, through your visuals.

421
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,304
P5.

422
00:25:42,504 --> 00:25:47,484
js can also use to simulate natural
phenomena from the movement of

423
00:25:47,524 --> 00:25:50,784
particulars to behavior of flock of birds.

424
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:53,689
You can model real world
systems using code.

425
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:59,129
By applying rules that mimic natural
processes, you can create simulations

426
00:25:59,139 --> 00:26:02,469
that behave in life like ways.

427
00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:06,249
For example, you can simulate the
growth of plants, the flow of water,

428
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:09,429
or even the way animals move in groups.

429
00:26:09,849 --> 00:26:13,821
They are simulations that are not
only visually interesting, but you

430
00:26:13,821 --> 00:26:21,254
can provide insight into Underling
mechanic of nature, all will pushing the

431
00:26:21,334 --> 00:26:23,324
boundaries of what art can represent.

432
00:26:23,824 --> 00:26:27,684
Randomness is a key ingredient
in many forms of algorithmic art.

433
00:26:28,664 --> 00:26:31,784
By incorporating randomness
into your code, you can create

434
00:26:31,844 --> 00:26:34,314
piece that never the same twice.

435
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:40,474
For example, you could generate a forest
trees with each tree as a unique shape.

436
00:26:40,624 --> 00:26:43,874
Or create abstract art where
colors and shapes appear in

437
00:26:43,874 --> 00:26:45,874
abstract and predictable forms.

438
00:26:46,374 --> 00:26:46,504
P5.

439
00:26:46,774 --> 00:26:51,794
js makes it easy to add randomness with
functions like random that introduce

440
00:26:51,974 --> 00:26:54,214
variables in size, position or color.

441
00:26:54,714 --> 00:27:01,414
The element of chance in your data adds
a layer of spontaneity allowing for

442
00:27:01,414 --> 00:27:03,754
surprise and often beautiful results.

443
00:27:04,254 --> 00:27:06,734
Beyond just reacting to user input, P5.

444
00:27:06,814 --> 00:27:08,859
js allows for randomness.

445
00:27:09,349 --> 00:27:14,609
Fully interactive generation where
the user can activate the app work.

446
00:27:14,829 --> 00:27:18,009
For example, you can create a
drawing tool that viewers become

447
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:21,889
the artist clicking and drawing
into their shapes on the canvas.

448
00:27:21,969 --> 00:27:26,379
Or you can build environments where the
user controls the evolution of patterns,

449
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,669
adjusting parameters in real time to
influence what happens on the screen.

450
00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:36,039
This floor, the line between creator
and audience turn the artistic process

451
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:38,339
into collaborative experiences.

452
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:44,829
One of the most Famous examples of
algorithmic art is Conway's Game of Life,

453
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:47,499
which is a tip of cellular automaton.

454
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:52,859
In this simulation, simple rules detect
wherever a cell on a grid is alive or

455
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:57,739
dead, and from those rules incredibly
complex patterns emerge over time.

456
00:27:58,249 --> 00:28:02,549
What makes this fascinating
is that it mimics real world

457
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:07,299
processes, like the growth of a
population for the spread of fires.

458
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:12,689
From a few basic rules, the game of
life has been a source of inspiration

459
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:15,274
for artists and scientists alike.

460
00:28:15,274 --> 00:28:21,119
And with P5GS, you can easily create
your own version of the cellular automata

461
00:28:21,829 --> 00:28:24,229
to explore beauty and simplify life.

462
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:25,909
rule bus system.

463
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:29,769
Now we have covered a wide
range of possibilities.

464
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:34,029
I want to share some resources that
will help you drive deeper into the

465
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:36,339
world of algorithmic art with p5.

466
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:36,809
js.

467
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:39,999
Whenever you are a beginner or an
experienced coder, the resource will

468
00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:44,084
provide inspirations, tutorials, and
tools to help you to create your own code.

469
00:28:44,084 --> 00:28:49,014
One of the best platforms to
explore and share your p5.

470
00:28:49,014 --> 00:28:51,524
js creation is Open Processing.

471
00:28:51,844 --> 00:28:55,934
It's an online community where artists
and coders share their projects, providing

472
00:28:55,964 --> 00:28:58,024
inspiration and learning opportunities.

473
00:28:58,234 --> 00:29:02,444
You can browse thousands of sketches,
many of which are open source,

474
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:06,214
meaning you can see the code behind
the visuals, learn from it, and even

475
00:29:06,214 --> 00:29:07,974
remix it to create something new.

476
00:29:08,474 --> 00:29:14,074
Open Processing is valuable not just
for showcasing work, but for fostering

477
00:29:14,074 --> 00:29:17,514
collaboration and experimentation
with the creative coding community.

478
00:29:18,014 --> 00:29:20,644
Let's look about this
sketch on Open Processing.

479
00:29:20,644 --> 00:29:24,504
This sketch uses basic shape
repetition and randomness to

480
00:29:24,504 --> 00:29:26,254
create an organic looking pattern.

481
00:29:26,784 --> 00:29:31,274
The code starts by definition,
simple shapes like circles and lines.

482
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,199
Then applies randomness to
their position, size, and color.

483
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:37,539
What do you guess is visually interesting?

484
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:42,479
Piece that looks like it was
drawn by hand, even though is

485
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:44,099
entirely generated by code.

486
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:47,389
Next, we have this example,
which showcases how p5.

487
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:50,939
js can be used to create
fluid continuous motion.

488
00:29:51,459 --> 00:29:55,339
This script simulates particles moving
across the canvas, influenced by

489
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,679
invisible forces like gravity or wind.

490
00:29:58,969 --> 00:30:02,169
The co release allows us to on vector
to define the position and velocities

491
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:06,819
of each particle, creating a dynamic
flowing visual that feels almost alive.

492
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:13,229
It's a great example of how PFGS can
bring movement and energy into your art.

493
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:16,309
Finally, let's look at that example.

494
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:20,269
This sketch demonstrates that the power
of convenient randomness with control.

495
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:24,789
The artist uses randomness to generate
abstract shapes, but also add parameters

496
00:30:24,849 --> 00:30:25,884
that control how the object moves.

497
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:29,334
How those shapes evolve every time.

498
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:34,434
The result is a piece that feels both
chaotic and intentional, where every

499
00:30:34,594 --> 00:30:36,724
refresh of the page brings something new.

500
00:30:36,924 --> 00:30:38,724
Yet, grounded, like this.

501
00:30:39,314 --> 00:30:41,164
Same underlying structure.

502
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,764
As we see today, Algorithmic
Arts is a powerful way to

503
00:30:44,764 --> 00:30:46,357
merge creative and technology.

504
00:30:46,357 --> 00:30:51,137
It's also allowed us to explore
new forms of expression where the

505
00:30:51,137 --> 00:30:54,234
artists and the code collaborate
to create something unique.

506
00:30:54,964 --> 00:30:58,474
What excites me most about this
field is that it challenges

507
00:30:58,474 --> 00:31:00,554
the traditional idea of art.

508
00:31:00,554 --> 00:31:05,499
It invites us to see beautiful in
logic, randomness, and in creativity.

509
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:06,989
in the unexpected.

510
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:11,279
Algorithmic art reminds us that
creativity doesn't have to be confined

511
00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:13,859
to paint brushes or scoping tools.

512
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:16,359
It can soon live in the code we write.

513
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:20,719
I know I've covered a lot of ground
today, and if you want to dig deeper,

514
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:25,914
there's an excellent resource I have
They've referenced it through this talk.

515
00:31:26,414 --> 00:31:31,844
If you enjoyed this talk and want to see
more of my work, or you have questions
