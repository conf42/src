efficiency by securely.

14
00:00:44,074 --> 00:00:47,675
Connecting the Salesforce data
with the large language models to

15
00:00:47,675 --> 00:00:50,044
create a relevant customized report.

16
00:00:50,044 --> 00:00:55,055
Salesforce also emerged as a pivotable
force in this transformation, introducing

17
00:00:55,055 --> 00:01:00,335
sophisticated solutions that fundamentally
reimagined that rail operations across the

18
00:01:00,335 --> 00:01:04,925
patient recruitment and the supply chain
optimization and the data management.

19
00:01:04,985 --> 00:01:09,455
And the, finally, the healthcare head
cp, the integration, this presentation.

20
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,890
Explores how the integration of
the advanced remission learning

00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,910
algorithms, the natural language
processing and predictive analysis.

22
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,930
The predictive analysis has a
fundamentally changed how the trails has

23
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,430
been redesigned, executed the monitored,
addressing the critical challenges,

24
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,320
enhancing the patient engagement, and
reducing the operational cost, and

25
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,270
maintaining the quality standards.

26
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,985
The impact on, the impact of, AA on, CTMS
is like, enrollment pattern prediction,

27
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:42,715
error reduction, and subject MA matching
the enrollment pattern prediction.

28
00:01:42,775 --> 00:01:46,105
The mission learning algorithms
have demonstrated a remarkable

29
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:50,335
accuracy in predicting the subject
enrollment patents while reducing

30
00:01:50,335 --> 00:01:52,310
the site collection timelines by.

31
00:01:52,915 --> 00:01:55,825
40% through the automated data analysis.

32
00:01:55,975 --> 00:02:00,805
This technology advancement has proven
the, particularly the crucial as the

33
00:02:00,865 --> 00:02:04,495
industry grapples with the increasing
the trail complexities and raising

34
00:02:04,495 --> 00:02:08,455
the operational cost and coming
to this error, reduction traction.

35
00:02:08,515 --> 00:02:12,395
The AA power, trail management
systems has achieved a major

36
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:16,925
reduction in data entry errors under
decreased protocol deviation rates.

37
00:02:17,425 --> 00:02:21,985
Above 50% across the phases between
like first phase to second phase

38
00:02:21,985 --> 00:02:23,095
and third phase of the trail.

39
00:02:23,305 --> 00:02:27,115
The platform predictive analysis
capabilities have revolutionized the

40
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:31,975
site collection process with the machine
learning models, analyzing over thousands

41
00:02:31,975 --> 00:02:37,405
of variables simultaneously, and the
subject matching the Salesforce AI driven.

42
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:42,065
Patient matching algorithms process
electronic health records above

43
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:46,866
90% specificity in identifying
the eligible trail candidates.

44
00:02:46,985 --> 00:02:51,215
And this sophisticated matching
resulted in reduction of the screen

45
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:54,995
failures, rates and above percentage
improvement in the patient retentions

46
00:02:55,495 --> 00:02:58,706
and the operational excellence
and operational excellence

47
00:02:58,706 --> 00:02:59,785
through the Salesforce.

48
00:03:00,206 --> 00:03:00,745
Yay.

49
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:05,685
In this section, we'll deal about this
instant analytic integration and workflow

50
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,085
optimization and patient experience.

51
00:03:08,585 --> 00:03:14,525
Instance, a instance, a power analytics
have demonstrated nearly 50% of reduction

52
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:20,166
in the trail timeline deviations while
improving the outcome prediction accuracy

53
00:03:20,316 --> 00:03:23,876
while across the phases of, from the
phase two, two, phase four trails.

54
00:03:24,446 --> 00:03:27,116
And this platform has
also predictive, analysis.

55
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:31,516
For the trail outcomes and have
achieved high accuracy rate forecasting

56
00:03:31,516 --> 00:03:35,061
the steady completion timelines
while reducing the operational in.

57
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:38,461
Inefficiencies workflow optimization.

58
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:44,101
Workflow is nothing but like the task and
how this automated task is helping the

59
00:03:44,101 --> 00:03:47,191
CTMS system and the workflow Automation.

60
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:52,551
workflow optimization features have
improved the resource utilization by 50%

61
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:57,621
while reducing the manual task processing
time and the real time performance

62
00:03:57,621 --> 00:04:02,061
monitoring capabilities continuously
analyze over thousands of metrics per

63
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:04,581
site, identifying the potential issues.

64
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:07,281
Patient experience enhancement.

65
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:10,801
The implementation of 24 7, yay.

66
00:04:10,801 --> 00:04:14,771
Power, patient support has
increased the patient satisfaction.

67
00:04:15,271 --> 00:04:19,111
Crosses for above 50% while
reducing the average query

68
00:04:19,111 --> 00:04:21,751
responses from hours two minutes.

69
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:26,351
And this is a big drastic change from,
for the patient experience enhancement

70
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:29,571
as it is changing the response
time from the hours two minutes.

71
00:04:29,961 --> 00:04:33,441
This intelligence support system
successfully manages the subject

72
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:38,001
inquiries automatically and
maintaining a participation participant

73
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:40,161
satisfaction rate above the 90%.

74
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:45,151
Apart from this, the Salesforce AA
also helps the, the business users in,

75
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:49,181
drafting the subjects and the sites
through the instate and the automated

76
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:55,451
AA capabilities in the CTMS system, and
as well as in the Salesforce CRM system

77
00:04:55,951 --> 00:04:56,841
data management.

78
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:57,081
And.

79
00:04:57,581 --> 00:05:01,781
And this data management and the compiles
are the very, the crucial steps in the, in

80
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:06,581
any industry, and particularly it's very
important in the life sensors industry.

81
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:09,761
And here in this, in this section,
we'll talk about the security

82
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:13,331
framework and the threat detection
and the natural language generation.

83
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:18,206
This, this a has the capability as we
have seen in many ways, like it enhances

84
00:05:18,206 --> 00:05:22,256
the system and again, reduces the time
and how it is helping the business

85
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:23,726
users in the real time scenarios.

86
00:05:24,026 --> 00:05:28,171
But however, still we, we have, we
had a thoughts of like how it'll

87
00:05:28,171 --> 00:05:31,981
handle the security framework
and threat detection and through

88
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,631
the natural language generations.

89
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:38,901
Yaya public, data protection systems has
demonstrated about 90% of the accuracy

90
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:41,001
rate in identifying the potential.

91
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:44,871
Security vulnerabilities
while processing an average of

92
00:05:44,871 --> 00:05:47,001
million data points per study.

93
00:05:47,361 --> 00:05:51,351
And these studies are very important,
and this and the security of the

94
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,711
framework needs to be maintained
at high vulnerability date.

95
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:59,681
So this AI powered data protection
systems will help, will help in

96
00:05:59,681 --> 00:06:04,531
demonstrating about 90% of the accuracy
rate and, the platform automated it.

97
00:06:04,746 --> 00:06:08,376
H-I-P-A-P compiling, monitoring
systems, that has assured ac

98
00:06:08,476 --> 00:06:13,846
accuracy rate in detecting the trail
violations and the threat detection.

99
00:06:14,086 --> 00:06:18,476
And this place a, plays a important role
in the, data management and the compiling

100
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:22,856
section and the realtime security
threat analysis capabilities process.

101
00:06:23,221 --> 00:06:26,491
Approximately hundreds of thousands
of security events per second.

102
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:31,551
This, AA has a capability and it has a
sophisticated system that successfully

103
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:36,541
prevented unauthorized access,
incidents while maintaining an average

104
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:41,591
response, time to just a milliseconds
for threat detection and mitigation.

105
00:06:41,831 --> 00:06:45,891
And this is the greatest achievement,
that we can see from the AA power.

106
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:48,861
And a language natural
language generation.

107
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:54,351
The system achieves about 95% accuracy
rate in this section by in generating

108
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:59,301
the standard clinical trail reports
while reducing the documentation time

109
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:02,031
by half compared to the manual process.

110
00:07:02,376 --> 00:07:06,936
And implementing of NLG, which is also
like a natural language generation

111
00:07:06,936 --> 00:07:10,916
technology, which has excelled in
reg regulatory submission process.

112
00:07:11,246 --> 00:07:16,836
Automating about 70% documentation task
while reducing the, preparation time

113
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,616
and intelligent subject
recruiting and matching.

114
00:07:19,616 --> 00:07:22,596
This plays a very important
role in the life sciences.

115
00:07:22,986 --> 00:07:26,406
especially for the CTMS systems
when we are working with the CTMS

116
00:07:26,406 --> 00:07:30,826
systems and how this a will help us
in subject recruiting and matching.

117
00:07:31,186 --> 00:07:34,966
The first one is, comes as like the
recruitment transformation, the recruit.

118
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:37,366
The second one is like a EHR integration.

119
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:41,166
The third one is the predict two analysis
will go one by one and how it is.

120
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:46,131
Helping the CTMS system and how the
Salesforce is directly impact on CTMS

121
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:50,941
system and how it is getting benefited for
the, subjects and as well as the business

122
00:07:50,941 --> 00:07:53,381
users Recruitment, transformation.

123
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:57,031
The, a driven recruitment strategies
have a two, a reduction in the subject

124
00:07:57,031 --> 00:08:01,831
identification time, and while maintaining
the accuracy, while maintaining the

125
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:03,901
accuracy rate in matching the patients.

126
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:05,681
Patients to appropriate trails.

127
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:09,531
The traditional recruitment, where the,
without, without aid driven approaches,

128
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:12,411
the manual approaches and the traditional
follow approaches, methods that

129
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:16,726
typically result in just a very minimal
of, eligible patients being enrolled.

130
00:08:17,026 --> 00:08:21,466
And it was like really challenging
for the life census industry domain

131
00:08:21,526 --> 00:08:25,626
way to match with this, recruiting
process of the transformation like this.

132
00:08:25,626 --> 00:08:30,066
E with the help of this yay driven
under the Salesforce EAA and this

133
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:34,296
met, this, a preferred approaches
increases this rate to 18 to 20%.

134
00:08:34,296 --> 00:08:35,106
It is just like the.

135
00:08:35,396 --> 00:08:38,996
Or five times more than that of the
manual, traditional, recruitment

136
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:41,636
methods and EHR integrations.

137
00:08:41,696 --> 00:08:45,606
EHR is nothing but like the electronic
health record, things and how this are

138
00:08:45,606 --> 00:08:49,746
integrated with the CTMS system and
with the Salesforce, the CRM and the

139
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:54,591
document management and how the Salesforce
AI is helping this, EHR integration.

140
00:08:54,906 --> 00:08:58,446
The natural language processing
algorithms have demonstrated about

141
00:08:58,866 --> 00:09:03,416
90% accuracy in extracting the
relevant clinical, information from

142
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,186
the unstructured medical records.

143
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:09,696
It is always a challenging to, to get the
information from the unstructured medical

144
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:11,811
records, with the a, a, with the aa.

145
00:09:12,521 --> 00:09:14,346
and this can be p and this can be.

146
00:09:14,586 --> 00:09:19,026
A hundred percent possible and we can
achieve 90% of accuracy in extracting

147
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:22,676
the relevant, clinical information
from this unstructured medical records.

148
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:27,596
The artificial intelligence facilitates
seamless data exchange between the

149
00:09:27,596 --> 00:09:29,836
different, different EEHR systems.

150
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:33,786
re it means like the breaking down
of the data sales, and enabling the.

151
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,896
Comprehensive patient insights
and the intelligent subjects

152
00:09:37,926 --> 00:09:39,396
recruitment and matching plays.

153
00:09:39,456 --> 00:09:43,866
It also plays a critical role in
the CTMS system and, the Salesforce

154
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:49,076
a is helping the business, at more
than a 90% with accuracy rate coming

155
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:50,916
to the, supply chain optimization.

156
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:54,446
This is one of this, important
area in the life sensors, industry.

157
00:09:54,836 --> 00:09:58,816
And, You see the how the overall impact
and how the inventory management and

158
00:09:58,816 --> 00:10:03,216
how the distribution optimization,
is helping this, yay and helping

159
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:04,546
this, supply chain, inventory.

160
00:10:04,756 --> 00:10:08,116
And overall the impact is like the
yay, a power supply chain solutions.

161
00:10:08,146 --> 00:10:12,856
How achieved a reduction in overall
logistic cost and while improving the.

162
00:10:13,356 --> 00:10:18,276
inventory accuracy to across the
multi multicenter trail sites

163
00:10:18,636 --> 00:10:21,306
and this deep learning models.

164
00:10:21,336 --> 00:10:24,406
The deep learning models that were
implemented, for the supply chain

165
00:10:24,436 --> 00:10:28,526
optimizations have demonstrated,
demonstrated improvement in the

166
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:32,686
resource utilization, compared to,
conventional, management systems.

167
00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:37,241
And, next coming to this, inventory
management and through machine

168
00:10:37,241 --> 00:10:41,751
learning algorithms and how we will
see how the inventory management, have

169
00:10:41,751 --> 00:10:45,451
transformed the, inve, Have transformed
and achieving a high accuracy rate.

170
00:10:45,451 --> 00:10:49,951
I can say like more than 80% of
the accuracy rate in predicting

171
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:51,871
the site specific supply needs.

172
00:10:52,431 --> 00:10:56,901
the system has resulted in a significant
reduction in stockout instance while

173
00:10:56,901 --> 00:10:58,701
maintaining the optimal inventory.

174
00:10:59,331 --> 00:11:02,561
Inventory levels are around,
30% below the traditional.

175
00:11:03,231 --> 00:11:08,721
management methods, the distribution
optimization reinforcement, reinforcement

176
00:11:08,721 --> 00:11:13,981
learning algorithms have reduced, have
reduced average delivery times and

177
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:19,171
transportation costs and, across the
international rail networks that this

178
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:23,246
system and, and this system, predictive
maintenance, scheduling, and has.

179
00:11:23,746 --> 00:11:28,966
99 percentage and temperature compliance
rate for the cold chain products while

180
00:11:28,966 --> 00:11:31,556
reducing the, temperature, exclusions.

181
00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:36,326
And the next section, we will see
how any, artificial intelligence

182
00:11:36,356 --> 00:11:38,736
enhanced the HCP integration.

183
00:11:38,796 --> 00:11:38,886
HS.

184
00:11:38,886 --> 00:11:41,806
CP is healthcare,
professional integration.

185
00:11:41,836 --> 00:11:44,636
And here, we will see the
different section like enhanced

186
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:47,281
deficiency, data model architecture.

187
00:11:47,856 --> 00:11:51,276
And, clinical decision, support
and the data validation.

188
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:55,056
So when it comes to the enhanced
efficiency, the, artificial intelligence

189
00:11:55,056 --> 00:12:00,966
enhanced HCP integration has demonstrated
reduction in data entry time, and, while

190
00:12:00,966 --> 00:12:06,836
achieving the data accuracy rate, or nine
or 90% across diverse, clinical settings.

191
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:09,236
And it comes to the
data model architecture.

192
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:13,266
this custom objects, this custom
objects for, Trail management has,

193
00:12:13,296 --> 00:12:18,506
resulted in a major reduction in
data redundancy while improving the

194
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:20,996
query responses times by double.

195
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:25,126
And coming to the clinical, decision
support, the realtime analysis

196
00:12:25,126 --> 00:12:29,796
capabilities also have the, improved
the patient outcome predictions

197
00:12:29,826 --> 00:12:33,276
with the decision support and the
processing complex and data with

198
00:12:33,276 --> 00:12:37,146
within minimal of seconds, just like
a few seconds, we can, the clinical

199
00:12:37,146 --> 00:12:38,436
decision support can be taken.

200
00:12:38,436 --> 00:12:42,006
The realtime analysis capabilities
have improved the patient outcome,

201
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:45,606
predictions with the decision
support and data validation.

202
00:12:45,936 --> 00:12:50,676
And automated protocols exhibit high
accuracy in real-time verification

203
00:12:50,946 --> 00:12:52,856
across multiple, data sources.

204
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:56,096
By reducing the manual
validation around 70%

205
00:12:56,596 --> 00:12:59,716
the development and the
development and the CTMS.

206
00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:03,206
Simulation here In this section we'll
talk about the machine learning,

207
00:13:03,256 --> 00:13:07,366
machine learning applications, the
protocol optimizations and the resource

208
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:10,786
allocations, the machine learning
applications, what are the machine

209
00:13:10,786 --> 00:13:14,386
learning applications and how it is
going to impact this, a powered trail

210
00:13:14,746 --> 00:13:19,756
simulations, how demonstrated reduction
in early phase development costs.

211
00:13:19,986 --> 00:13:23,886
And while achieving the, while
achieving the above 80% accuracy rate

212
00:13:23,946 --> 00:13:28,286
in predicting the trail outcomes,
the A driven, virtual trails have

213
00:13:28,286 --> 00:13:32,546
achieved accuracy in, predicting the
subject responses while reducing the

214
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:38,216
required patient enrollment In early
studies around 25%, and it can be more.

215
00:13:38,216 --> 00:13:42,806
These numbers are just based on the
research and the PVOs that perform

216
00:13:43,016 --> 00:13:45,096
and how the, a has given the results.

217
00:13:45,126 --> 00:13:46,206
And these results may.

218
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:50,811
Vary when working with the real time, and
it'll be definitely, and it'll be more

219
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:55,731
accuracy rate than of the assumptions of
the rate and the protocol optimization.

220
00:13:55,731 --> 00:14:00,981
Machine learning algorithms have improved
protocol, design efficiency by above 50%,

221
00:14:01,071 --> 00:14:05,281
reducing the amend, amendment compared
to traditional design methodologies,

222
00:14:05,641 --> 00:14:09,601
the system's patient burden assessment
capabilities have analyzed approximately,

223
00:14:09,651 --> 00:14:14,761
300 protocol specific factors around,
like near to 300, protocol specific

224
00:14:14,761 --> 00:14:20,171
factors to predict, patient dropout risk
with accuracy and resource allocation.

225
00:14:20,471 --> 00:14:25,781
This predictive methods achieve around
80% of accuracy in forecasting the

226
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,761
site specific resource requirement.

227
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:33,211
And this enhanced, precision has resulted,
has resulted, in resource wastage.

228
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:37,031
And significant in improvement
in the site productivity across

229
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:41,851
multi-center, trails, particularly
in, complex, phase three studies.

230
00:14:42,211 --> 00:14:45,591
And when you come to this,
future, I'll make look this

231
00:14:45,591 --> 00:14:46,911
and the future implications.

232
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:52,371
And in this future implications we can
or we can see enhance prediction accuracy

233
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:55,361
and, Reduced recruitment timelines.

234
00:14:55,391 --> 00:14:57,341
This is one of the most important.

235
00:14:57,341 --> 00:15:00,751
and, through AA we can achieve
this and we can reduce up to

236
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:05,551
40% acceleration in patient
identification and enrollment process.

237
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,611
And the thought is like
the protocol optimization.

238
00:15:08,911 --> 00:15:14,456
Optimization is like a. Decrease in costly
and time consuming protocol amendments.

239
00:15:14,576 --> 00:15:17,636
And within the fourth section,
we can check about the improved

240
00:15:17,636 --> 00:15:21,641
subject, 30 to 35% of enhancement
in the participant rotations.

241
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:25,961
Across all the clinical trail phases, we
see the current implementation results, it

242
00:15:25,961 --> 00:15:28,506
varies between 81% enhancing these things.

243
00:15:28,681 --> 00:15:35,106
The integration of Salesforce a into the
CTMS systems represent a paradigm shift

244
00:15:35,106 --> 00:15:37,146
for the life census information research.

245
00:15:37,491 --> 00:15:41,221
which are deliverable like,
measurable impacts, across, multiple

246
00:15:41,221 --> 00:15:43,141
operational, dis dimensions.

247
00:15:43,531 --> 00:15:48,061
This platform also, this platform
also demonstrate a high boost, high

248
00:15:48,061 --> 00:15:51,931
percentage increase in the boost in
the operational efficiency, translating

249
00:15:51,931 --> 00:15:56,041
the more resource effective resource
utilization and a remarkable,

250
00:15:56,471 --> 00:15:58,241
increase in the trail success rates.

251
00:15:58,361 --> 00:15:59,621
And throughout the phase two.

252
00:16:00,351 --> 00:16:05,171
to phase four levels of, of the CTMS
lifecycle, fundamentally, transfer

253
00:16:05,171 --> 00:16:09,821
meaning how a pharmaceutical company
design and execute, clinical studies.

254
00:16:10,321 --> 00:16:11,581
Coming to the conclusion.

255
00:16:12,211 --> 00:16:14,751
And here in this section, all the
section we have, discussed about

256
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:19,261
how the Gen, generatively helps and
how the artificial, helps in supply

257
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:21,951
chain, optimization and CTMS systems.

258
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:26,761
And we also discuss about the data
management and the compiling, to give the

259
00:16:26,761 --> 00:16:30,391
conclusion, to give the conclusion that
the integration of the sa Salesforce in.

260
00:16:31,136 --> 00:16:34,646
CTMS systems represent as we are
telling the shift in life sciences

261
00:16:34,646 --> 00:16:36,056
research and the development.

262
00:16:36,476 --> 00:16:40,596
And it has the enhanced, enhanced
analytics and efficiency.

263
00:16:40,596 --> 00:16:45,406
The AA power tools have improved,
operational efficiency by around

264
00:16:45,406 --> 00:16:50,586
40%, the clinical success rate,
which will be more than 35%, using

265
00:16:50,586 --> 00:16:55,366
this AI power while reducing the,
trail timelines by around 30%.

266
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:59,406
Optimize the patient engagement
through a algorithms, the

267
00:16:59,406 --> 00:17:01,086
patient matching precision.

268
00:17:01,356 --> 00:17:05,046
Or we can say like the subject
matching precision increased by 80%

269
00:17:05,376 --> 00:17:10,146
with the significant reductions in the
protocol, deviations, creating more,

270
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:15,316
Patient, centric trail experiences,
the future ready compliance, the data

271
00:17:15,316 --> 00:17:17,416
entry error, the data entry errors.

272
00:17:17,946 --> 00:17:21,426
the data entry definitely,
can be reduced by 90%.

273
00:17:21,706 --> 00:17:25,966
ensuring the regulatory compliance
while the platform continues to evolve

274
00:17:26,231 --> 00:17:30,686
with the advanced i a capabilities
and, protocol optimization.

275
00:17:30,686 --> 00:17:33,956
The real tempation support
and this platform as the

276
00:17:33,956 --> 00:17:35,096
platform continues to evolve.

277
00:17:35,766 --> 00:17:39,576
The future developments in the AI
capabilities to further revolutionize

278
00:17:39,576 --> 00:17:45,216
the CTMS system, ultimately contributing
to more efficient and effective clinical

279
00:17:45,216 --> 00:17:47,586
trails in the life census industry.

280
00:17:47,976 --> 00:17:48,516
