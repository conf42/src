00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,130
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,110
Pratish and I are excited to welcome
you to our talk on healthcare

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,729
chatbots and explainable AI.

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:13,029
Today we'll delve into the evolving role
of healthcare chatbots, the integration

5
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:18,020
of generative AI capabilities, and the
critical importance of explainable AI.

6
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,040
We'll explore their current impact,
future potential, and how they are

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,890
transforming the healthcare landscape.

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,330
Towards the end.

9
00:00:25,645 --> 00:00:29,035
We'll also discuss the challenges
these technologies face and potential

10
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:30,975
strategies for their broader adoption.

11
00:00:31,475 --> 00:00:34,184
Today's agenda is as
displayed on the screen.

12
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,315
We hope you'll enjoy this talk.

13
00:00:36,595 --> 00:00:37,645
Over to Radhesh.

14
00:00:38,165 --> 00:00:38,844
Thanks, Abhishek.

15
00:00:39,675 --> 00:00:43,504
Let's begin with how AI powered
chatbots are transforming healthcare

16
00:00:43,504 --> 00:00:47,450
by addressing accessibility, cost,
and personalization challenges.

17
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:52,914
AI chatbots alleviate geographical
and scheduling barriers, ensuring

18
00:00:52,915 --> 00:00:54,824
24 7 support for patients.

19
00:00:55,604 --> 00:00:59,214
They provide personalized care
by adapting to individual patient

20
00:00:59,214 --> 00:01:01,254
data, enhancing engagement.

21
00:01:02,035 --> 00:01:05,095
And they also streamline
processes like symptom checking

22
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:08,424
and chronic disease management,
making healthcare more efficient.

23
00:01:09,184 --> 00:01:12,804
These capabilities set
the stage for how chatbots

24
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:14,695
revolutionize healthcare delivery.

25
00:01:15,195 --> 00:01:19,934
Expanding on the need for 24X's
ability, one of the primary benefits

26
00:01:19,964 --> 00:01:24,024
of AI chatbots is their ability to
provide round the clock support.

27
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,780
Unlike traditional systems, limited
by office hours, chatbots are

28
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:33,700
always available to guide patients
or escalate care when necessary.

29
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:38,039
They also support chronic condition
management through continuous

30
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,439
monitoring and reminders.

31
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:44,759
Triage ing symptoms quickly saves time
and provides healthcare providers with

32
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:46,969
tools they can use to identify care.

33
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,350
A great example could be, imagine a
diabetic patient receiving a reminder

34
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:57,729
to check their blood sugar if there
is a glucose spike or a drop, so that

35
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:02,199
the chatbot can ensure the signal can
be captured for appropriate treatment.

36
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,960
This brings us to how Genitive AI
is changing healthcare chatbots.

37
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,120
Genitive AI takes healthcare chatbots
to the next level by making interactions

38
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,180
more dynamic and patient specific.

39
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,309
These chatbots deliver contextual
responses, enhancing the user experience.

40
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,700
They simplify medical jargon
into patient friendly language,

41
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,609
improving clarity and engagement.

42
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,200
This personalization builds trust
and ensures patients feel understood.

43
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:37,570
One of the key elements in chatbots
is their ability to retain what

44
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:39,159
has been already discussed.

45
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:44,219
Has it happened many times to us that
repeating ourselves to different doctors

46
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,409
tend to frustrate us over and over again?

47
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:52,549
AI chatbots, due to their vast context
retention, aim to eliminate that and

48
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:56,899
have a coherent patient history while
talking to them, remembering most of the

49
00:02:56,899 --> 00:03:02,329
things that they have asked the chatbots
to remember or stress the importance on.

50
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:06,569
Context retention ensures
chatbots remember past interaction

51
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:08,259
and provide continuity.

52
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:13,549
This enhances trust, reduces
frustrations, and also speeds up support.

53
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,319
Another key element.

54
00:03:15,834 --> 00:03:20,484
In chatbots is the amount of
memory the chatbots can retain.

55
00:03:20,485 --> 00:03:25,415
AI chatbots don't just assist
patients, they also evolve over time.

56
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:29,334
Using deep learning and reinforcement
learning, they refine their

57
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,234
interactions for better accuracy.

58
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,594
Technologies like Knowledge
Graph help them contextualize

59
00:03:34,635 --> 00:03:35,984
medical data effectively.

60
00:03:36,624 --> 00:03:40,994
This continuous learning ensures the
chatbot improves with every interaction.

61
00:03:41,494 --> 00:03:44,894
This brings us to one of the
core topics of our discussion

62
00:03:44,894 --> 00:03:46,484
today, which is explainable AI.

63
00:03:46,984 --> 00:03:49,504
In healthcare, blind
trust in AI isn't enough.

64
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:53,589
Patients need to understand
why and how decisions about

65
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,919
their health are being made.

66
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,379
While the benefits are immense, we
must also acknowledge that we need

67
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:01,169
to address the ethical challenges.

68
00:04:01,869 --> 00:04:06,319
Explainable AI intends to
transform the black box into

69
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,219
transparent medical assistance.

70
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:13,119
Transparency ensures patients know
that they are interacting with AI.

71
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:18,459
Healthcare professionals also need to
verify the logic used for the decision.

72
00:04:18,854 --> 00:04:21,784
or the recommendations made
by the healthcare jackpot.

73
00:04:22,584 --> 00:04:29,554
Healthcare AI can also get help from
explainable AI to meet regulatory

74
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:32,874
and compliance standards set by
governments and institutions.

75
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:37,994
To the patients, it's also beneficial
because it can, again, just like

76
00:04:38,274 --> 00:04:42,304
explaining it to the healthcare
providers, give tools to validate the

77
00:04:42,304 --> 00:04:44,364
logic while remaining in compliance.

78
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:49,679
Let us now look at how we can actually
achieve this transparency through some

79
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:52,249
of the specific explainable AI methods.

80
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:57,699
Explainable AI methods broadly fall
into two categories, the model agnostic

81
00:04:57,699 --> 00:04:59,859
ones and the model specific ones.

82
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:04,039
Some of the model agnostic ones are
discussed here, such as line, Okay.

83
00:05:04,424 --> 00:05:08,164
which tries to explain responses
through approximations useful for

84
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:10,084
explaining complex decision making.

85
00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:16,434
SHAP, where each input feature gets an
importance value, or the counterfactual

86
00:05:16,454 --> 00:05:19,934
method, which is a classic way of
assessing the what if scenarios.

87
00:05:20,884 --> 00:05:25,104
All of these methods have been widely used
across machine learning and AI systems

88
00:05:25,104 --> 00:05:27,714
to interpret and explain ML models.

89
00:05:28,384 --> 00:05:31,754
Let's now look at some of the
more model specific methods.

90
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,459
Some of these methods might seem familiar
to those who come from a machine learning

91
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,459
background, such as decision trees.

92
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:40,719
or feature importance analysis.

93
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:44,869
They have a lot of things in common where
decision trees, just like in traditional

94
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:49,499
methods, can create feature importances
that can be interpreted for future use.

95
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:53,399
Model specific methods can help
understand how each feature

96
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:58,189
contributes to the outcome and can
be communicated to the healthcare

97
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:00,029
professionals providing that care.

98
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:05,909
Feature analysis uses each input feature
and assigns an importance value to it.

99
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:09,539
Whereas layer wise propagations,
such as used in clinical trials,

100
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:13,339
The convolution neural networks
or traditional neural networks can

101
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,299
help give the same information.

102
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:19,369
I'll hand it over to Abhishek
now to talk about more on the

103
00:06:19,369 --> 00:06:20,839
data engineering side of things.

104
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,159
Thank you, Rathesh.

105
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:26,489
Behind every effective AI chatbot is
a solid data engineering framework.

106
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:30,599
Robust data engineering ensures clean,
reliable, and scalable pipelines

107
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:32,519
that drive chatbot algorithms.

108
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:36,379
These pipelines enable real time
data ingestion, storage, and

109
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:40,279
processing, which is critical for
immediate and accurate responses.

110
00:06:40,749 --> 00:06:44,389
Seamless integration of diverse
data sources to support personalized

111
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:46,059
and context aware interactions.

112
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:51,189
The key components include ETL
pipelines, data lakes to store

113
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:55,899
diverse data sets, both structured and
unstructured, such as medical images,

114
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:58,129
patient notes, and device readings.

115
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:03,209
Also, data warehouses enable fast
querying and reporting, helping

116
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:06,799
healthcare providers quickly retrieve
insights for decision making.

117
00:07:07,299 --> 00:07:10,829
Now let's dive into the architecture
that powers these chatbots.

118
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:14,939
The workflow consists of several
interconnected components, starting

119
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:19,869
with data sources, which store patient
records, IoT devices like wearables,

120
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:24,249
and medical knowledge graphs from
the backbone of the data feeding into

121
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:30,159
chatbots, batch processing, such as
daily updates, ensuring data consistency,

122
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:35,449
while real time streaming also allows
chatbots to respond instantly to events

123
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:37,309
like a patient's abnormal heart rate.

124
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:42,929
After data pipeline is set up, we use
the data for AI model training, enabling

125
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:46,029
chatbots to deliver personalized and
mathematically sound interactions.

126
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:51,304
Finally, chatbots integrate with
mobile apps or web platforms, offering

127
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,454
patients easy access anytime, anywhere.

128
00:07:54,954 --> 00:07:58,474
While these technologies offer
incredible potential, they also

129
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,474
raise important ethical questions.

130
00:08:01,074 --> 00:08:07,104
Given the sensitivity of Healthcare data,
secure storage and secure transmission are

131
00:08:07,124 --> 00:08:09,304
paramount to maintaining patient trust.

132
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,554
Patients must know they're interacting
with AI and give informed consent

133
00:08:13,584 --> 00:08:15,094
for how their data is used.

134
00:08:15,724 --> 00:08:20,534
AI models must be trained on diverse data
sets to avoid biases that could lead to

135
00:08:20,574 --> 00:08:22,714
inaccurate or unsafe recommendations.

136
00:08:23,574 --> 00:08:27,474
AI should complement, not replace,
human healthcare providers.

137
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,774
The goal is to enhance care
while retaining the human touch.

138
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:34,559
Now, I will hand it back to
Ratesh for closing comments.

139
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:35,729
Thanks, Abhishek.

140
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,869
Of course, no technology
is without its challenges.

141
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:45,179
Running AI systems is already a complex
task, and add to it explainable AI

142
00:08:45,229 --> 00:08:47,159
and the requirement goes even higher.

143
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:51,219
We need to address technical
reliability, operational training,

144
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:53,149
and ethical guidelines likewise.

145
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:59,084
Clear regulations on privacy and consent
are essential for widespread adoption.

146
00:08:59,484 --> 00:09:03,944
Guidelines like HIPAA needs to
be followed strictly, as well as

147
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:08,174
clinical validation and integration
is needed for a widespread adoption.

148
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:11,574
Thank you so much for listening
to our talk and I hope you

149
00:09:11,574 --> 00:09:12,904
have a great rest of your day.
