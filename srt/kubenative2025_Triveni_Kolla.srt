1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,550
Greetings everyone.

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:02,300
This is Vela.

3
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,930
I'm working as a senior
BI developer at Coach Vti.

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,560
I have 10 plus years of expertise
in leading highly technical

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,250
MicroStrategy, Tableau, and
healthcare data warehousing projects.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,424
So my today's topic is.

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,460
AI Ready Healthcare data
revolutionizing fraud detection with

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,589
scalable data centric intelligence.

9
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,949
So coming to the healthcare fraud crisis.

10
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:28,640
So as you all might know, the
healthcare fraud crisis is a significant

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,299
and growing issue that impacts
the healthcare systems worldwide.

12
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:37,280
And most notably in countries like
United States, where a large sums

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,519
of money flow through both public
and private healthcare systems.

14
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,420
Healthcare fraud not only results
in billions of dollars lost.

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:50,550
In financial losses, but it also erodes
trust, compromises patient care, and

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,560
influences healthcare costs to everyone.

17
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:59,250
So if you see here, there is
almost like annual US fraud losses

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,379
is almost like $300 billion.

19
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:06,720
The healthcare fraud range as estimated
of $300 billion from the US system

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,210
annually, and it represents up to.

21
00:01:10,085 --> 00:01:14,195
The 10% of total healthcare spending
and diverting critical resources.

22
00:01:14,615 --> 00:01:20,314
And if you see there is almost
75% of unstructured data that is

23
00:01:20,595 --> 00:01:23,085
impacting the healthcare's staggering.

24
00:01:23,085 --> 00:01:27,165
Three quarters of healthcare data
remains unstructured, severely hindering

25
00:01:27,495 --> 00:01:31,455
automated analysis and the efficient
detection of fraudulent patents.

26
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:32,295
And.

27
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:37,855
There are almost like 80% of the
coding errors, so this is alarmingly.

28
00:01:38,245 --> 00:01:42,115
So there are four out of five
medical bills that contain errors,

29
00:01:42,355 --> 00:01:46,105
creating significant vulnerabilities
and opportunities for fraudulent

30
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:50,665
activities, the healthcare fraud
process, and immense and escalating

31
00:01:50,665 --> 00:01:52,885
financial threat to the industries.

32
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,990
And the she scale and complexity of
this challenge are gently demand a data

33
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,430
driven solution to protect the vital
resources and ensure equitable care.

34
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,580
Going to the next slide.

35
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,940
So the main challenge here in
the healthcare fraud crisis

36
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,739
is the data quality challenge.

37
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:14,750
So despite like significant advancements
in AI and mission learning, traditional

38
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,780
fraud detection in healthcare
remains alarmingly in effective.

39
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,530
The fundamental flaw lies not
only in the sophistication of

40
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,870
our analytical models, but it is.

41
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:30,380
In the deeply compromised data
foundations, poor data quality is rampant

42
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,959
and manifesting as inconsistent formatting
across disparate systems and incomplete

43
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:40,670
patient records written in duplicate
entries and critical coding discrepancies.

44
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:45,880
Let me come up with few scenarios
where the data quality undermines

45
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,149
detection, like how poor data quality
is causing healthcare fraud crisis.

46
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:55,169
So there is a scenario where
a provider might bill multiple

47
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:58,859
insurers for the same service and a
slightly different patient, right?

48
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:01,904
In such scenario, the
consequence might be.

49
00:03:02,404 --> 00:03:06,424
It is missed as a duplicate because
due to the inconsistent identifiers

50
00:03:06,814 --> 00:03:08,584
and in the second scenario.

51
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:12,114
A machine learning model, which
is trained on incomplete data.

52
00:03:12,474 --> 00:03:16,074
So this produces inaccurate
risk scores and biases.

53
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:21,684
And the third one is a telehealth session
is bill, but patient data is incomplete

54
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:25,164
or mis miss missing from the conversation.

55
00:03:25,344 --> 00:03:28,974
So in such case, a fraudulent
billing may go unnoticed.

56
00:03:29,214 --> 00:03:31,494
So these healthcare organizations.

57
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:36,849
Frequently find themselves lock in
a frustrating cycle where increasing

58
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:41,289
computational power and model
complexity diminishing returns.

59
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:43,629
This is not an algorithmic challenge.

60
00:03:43,779 --> 00:03:48,909
It is a foundational data quality
crisis that undermines even the most

61
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:51,369
advanced machine learning approaches.

62
00:03:51,374 --> 00:03:55,344
So the two potential of
sophisticated AI for fraud

63
00:03:55,344 --> 00:03:58,344
prevention will remain unrealized.

64
00:03:58,855 --> 00:04:06,234
Coming to the AI models, so there are two
types of AI models in my current analysis.

65
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:09,880
One is the traditional model and the
other is the data centric AI model.

66
00:04:10,315 --> 00:04:15,524
In the traditional model, the front
detection focuses on refining algorithms

67
00:04:15,554 --> 00:04:17,684
and increasing model complexity.

68
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:21,164
Viewing the data as an unchangeable input.

69
00:04:21,664 --> 00:04:25,294
This model centric approach is
inherently limited by data quality.

70
00:04:25,594 --> 00:04:29,854
Even advanced AI struggles with
inconsistent and erroneous regards

71
00:04:30,155 --> 00:04:33,424
leading to diminishing returns
despite computational investment.

72
00:04:33,924 --> 00:04:38,124
Whereas the data centric AI seems
to be unlocking true potential.

73
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:43,584
It shifts the focus, it improving data
quality is the most effective path.

74
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:49,994
To robust ai, this approach prioritizes
systematic data governance, continuous

75
00:04:49,994 --> 00:04:55,484
quality monitoring and proactive data
enrichment By ensuring data integrity,

76
00:04:55,694 --> 00:04:59,984
we are building a strong foundation
for AI success in fraud detection.

77
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:01,424
So if you see the.

78
00:05:01,924 --> 00:05:05,434
The picture here, so it stating
the fundamental shift from a model

79
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:09,934
centric to a data centric mindset
is not just an optimization, but

80
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:13,804
it's critical reevaluation of
how we approach AI challenges.

81
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:19,954
For healthcare fraud detection, it means
moving beyond React algorithm tweaks

82
00:05:19,954 --> 00:05:25,409
to pro two data excellence, and finally
enabling AI to deliver on its promise.

83
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:27,119
So why it matters.

84
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:31,279
In healthcare, in sensitive
and high stake domains.

85
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:34,369
The healthcare fraud
crisis plays a major role.

86
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:37,069
So it is occurring recurring.

87
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:41,259
It is giving like more recurring
losses to the companies.

88
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:47,919
So there is potential for a true
data-centric AI model to get rid

89
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,019
of all these inconsistencies.

90
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:54,609
The bigger impact is on the performance
than the small model improvements.

91
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:59,079
A well labeled high quality data set
can enable a simple logistic regression

92
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:03,954
model to outperform a deep neural
network trained on MC or a biased

93
00:06:04,144 --> 00:06:06,644
data, the transformational results.

94
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:09,224
The impact of data-centric ai.

95
00:06:09,594 --> 00:06:14,844
Below are the main metrics that
define the results in the data-centric

96
00:06:14,844 --> 00:06:16,614
AI elevated model accuracy.

97
00:06:16,974 --> 00:06:17,349
So here.

98
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:23,429
Achieving 95% accuracy enables
unprecedented precision in identifying

99
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:27,119
fraudulent activities and thus
protecting the vital resources

100
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:31,919
and ensuring equitable care and
significant false positive reduction.

101
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:37,559
So an 95% reduction in false positive,
it cons the investigator overhead

102
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:41,669
and allows the healthcare teams
to focus on legitimate threats and

103
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:46,439
process the claims more efficiently,
saving the valuable time and money.

104
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,789
And the third one is the
accelerated investigation cycles.

105
00:06:51,299 --> 00:06:55,859
A 70% foster fraud detection and
resolution process allows healthcare

106
00:06:55,859 --> 00:07:01,079
organizations to quickly mitigate
ongoing losses, recovers funds swiftly

107
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:05,674
and streamline operational workflows
through enhance data arability.

108
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:11,939
And the final one is the substantial fraud
loss reduction organizations realize.

109
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:17,504
A 76% reduction in financial losses
due to fraud, directly attributable

110
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:21,464
to enhancer detection capabilities
stemming from superior data quality.

111
00:07:21,854 --> 00:07:26,594
This translates into millions saved
and reinvested in patient care these

112
00:07:26,594 --> 00:07:31,574
are the four key factors and continuous
data quality improvement framework.

113
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:35,984
It is essential to ensure that
AI systems remain accurate,

114
00:07:35,984 --> 00:07:37,724
reliable, and fair over time.

115
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:42,794
Unlike traditional software systems,
AI is highly sensitive to the quality

116
00:07:42,794 --> 00:07:47,804
of data, and this directly influences
performance bias and outcomes.

117
00:07:48,104 --> 00:07:54,374
This framework treats data as a living
asset, not a static input requiring

118
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:59,114
ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and
refinement through the AI lifecycle.

119
00:07:59,744 --> 00:08:03,224
So coming to the first part, it's
data profiling and assessment.

120
00:08:03,404 --> 00:08:07,509
The analysis of these data assets,
identifying qualifying gaps,

121
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:12,014
inconsistencies and structural issues
across all healthcare data sources.

122
00:08:12,434 --> 00:08:15,669
The second one is the quality
metrics definition, establishing.

123
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:22,619
Quantifiable standards for completeness,
accuracy, consistency, and timelines that

124
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:24,839
align with fraud detection requirements.

125
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:27,119
And the third one is automated monitoring.

126
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:31,019
The real time quality monitoring
systems that flag deviations have

127
00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:32,619
correct to actions before the take.

128
00:08:33,064 --> 00:08:36,844
Data quality es, and the final
is the iterative improvement.

129
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:41,734
So implementing these feedback loops
that continuously refine the data quality

130
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:46,864
processes based on model performance and
the detection outcomes coming to the.

131
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:51,399
Machine learning model
performance, and these frameworks

132
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:53,169
treat data as a living asset.

133
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:57,879
It's not a static input requiring
ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and

134
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,649
refinement through the AI lifecycle.

135
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:04,329
So if you see here with high
quality, meticulously governed

136
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:09,974
healthcare data, the methods like
random forest accelerate uncovering.

137
00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:14,709
Complex fraud patterns and
leveraging multiple decision trees.

138
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:20,439
This model, the random forest offers
robust pattern recognition and crucial

139
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:25,569
interpretability essential for regulatory
compliance and audit trails in healthcare.

140
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:30,139
If you see the rest of the model models,
they're like little underperforming

141
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:31,734
when compared to the random forest.

142
00:09:32,234 --> 00:09:37,034
These strong performance metrics, they're
very vital for healthcare organizations.

143
00:09:37,364 --> 00:09:41,324
High accuracy ensures reliable
distinction between legitimate

144
00:09:41,324 --> 00:09:42,674
and frontline activities.

145
00:09:42,914 --> 00:09:48,384
Superior precision minimizes false
positives, preventing unwarranted

146
00:09:48,384 --> 00:09:49,914
flagging of valid claims.

147
00:09:50,414 --> 00:09:54,944
Strong recall reduces false positives,
this blend of advanced analytics

148
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:59,084
and quality data and purpose
organizations to detect fraud and

149
00:09:59,084 --> 00:10:01,274
improve the speed and the data quality.

150
00:10:01,774 --> 00:10:07,084
And coming to the methods, the blockchain
for data integrity and in immutable audit

151
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:13,324
trails, blockchain technologies provide
99% of data integrity assurance through

152
00:10:13,564 --> 00:10:15,814
cryptographically secure transaction logs.

153
00:10:16,144 --> 00:10:20,614
Every data modification creates an
immutable record, and this enables.

154
00:10:21,604 --> 00:10:24,934
Comprehensive audit trails
essentially for healthcare complaints.

155
00:10:25,444 --> 00:10:29,494
So the TAM proof transaction records,
the real time integrity verification,

156
00:10:29,494 --> 00:10:34,354
distributed consensus mechanisms, and
the regulatory compliance automation.

157
00:10:34,714 --> 00:10:39,694
And this approach basically eliminates
the data manipulation vulnerabilities

158
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:43,309
while maintaining the transparency
required for effective fraud

159
00:10:43,749 --> 00:10:45,869
investigation and regulatory reporting.

160
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:49,669
And the auto machine learning
pipeline acceleration.

161
00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:55,129
This process involves the data addition
where the automated pre-processing

162
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:58,879
and feature engineering reduce
the manual intervention by 90%.

163
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:03,169
The model selection, intelligent
algorithm selection optimizes

164
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:07,304
performance across diverse fraud
patterns, training acceleration.

165
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:11,689
So the model training time through
optimized resource allocation,

166
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:16,429
so there is like a 78% reduction
in the model training through.

167
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:19,399
Optimized resource allocation deployment.

168
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,379
So there is a seamless integration into
existing healthcare IT infrastructure.

169
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:28,429
So these are all the advanced fraud
detection capabilities, and this
