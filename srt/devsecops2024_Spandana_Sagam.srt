00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:05,240
Welcome to the conference
42 DevOps Cops 2024.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,215
I'm Spandana Saigam.

4
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:11,649
I'm excited to be here to discuss the
future of transportation navigating

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,960
through automated and autonomous vehicles.

6
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:18,195
With my background in autonomous
vehicle technology, I worked

7
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:22,915
excessively on advancements of AI,
sensor fusions, and mobility solutions.

8
00:00:23,074 --> 00:00:26,474
Throughout my career, I'm fortunate
enough to contribute for the development

9
00:00:26,544 --> 00:00:31,235
of these systems that will redefine the
future of transportation, focusing on

10
00:00:31,414 --> 00:00:33,974
safety, efficiency, and urban mobility.

11
00:00:34,474 --> 00:00:38,564
The topics we are going to discuss on
this presentation is Autonomous vehicles,

12
00:00:38,594 --> 00:00:44,594
their safety, how they are impacting our
urban and logistics at the same time.

13
00:00:44,594 --> 00:00:48,494
What are the challenges we
face ethically and socially?

14
00:00:48,994 --> 00:00:49,994
Autonomous vehicles.

15
00:00:50,194 --> 00:00:53,844
Autonomous vehicles are powered by
a variety of autonomous advanced

16
00:00:53,844 --> 00:00:57,134
technologies, including AI,
machine learning and sensor fusion.

17
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:01,899
These technologies Take the real
time decisions by preserving their,

18
00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:07,029
360 degrees view of the surroundings
and reduce the human errors.

19
00:01:07,559 --> 00:01:12,519
AVs are, AVs has been differentiated
by the level of automation.

20
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:15,689
They differ from level 0 to level 5.

21
00:01:15,839 --> 00:01:18,270
How AVs are good for the safety.

22
00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:22,295
One of the most significant
benefits of AV is their potential

23
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:25,065
to reduce the traffic accidents.

24
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:30,375
Human errors accounts up to 93%, 94
percent of serious traffic crashes,

25
00:01:30,665 --> 00:01:34,614
but AV can respond 25 percent
faster than humans because of the

26
00:01:34,614 --> 00:01:37,804
combination of advanced sensors and
real time decision making algorithms.

27
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,694
That means AV can make decisions
such as braking, avoiding

28
00:01:41,694 --> 00:01:44,934
obstacles in milliseconds,
enhancing in the road safety.

29
00:01:45,434 --> 00:01:46,974
Urban mobility transportation.

30
00:01:47,864 --> 00:01:51,634
AVs will also significantly
transport urban mobility by

31
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:52,704
reducing the vehicle ownerships.

32
00:01:52,705 --> 00:01:58,424
AV can be used as a shared fleet,
reducing the number of cars on the roads.

33
00:01:58,724 --> 00:02:02,754
Because of this, it reduces the
parking areas for green spaces

34
00:02:02,784 --> 00:02:06,599
and pedestrian zones, potential
redemption in parking areas.

35
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:09,869
usage from 14 percent to 5
percent of the urban land.

36
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:11,459
What are the benefits of this?

37
00:02:11,779 --> 00:02:15,729
The most important benefit of this
is it reduces the traffic congestion

38
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:18,649
and increases the public transport.

39
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:21,999
It also helps the elderly
and disabled people.

40
00:02:22,499 --> 00:02:23,419
Logistics.

41
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:29,349
These AV vehicles can be used 24 by
7, whereas human drivers, whereas the

42
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:33,169
vehicles used by the human drivers
are limited by the regulations.

43
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:37,449
The key advantage of this AVs
are it reduces the human error,

44
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:42,249
enhances the fuel efficiency and
it predicts the delivery schedules

45
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,879
based on the AI powered optimization.

46
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:49,189
It also helps in the last minute
deliveries using the AI drones.

47
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:54,679
The next, the most important aspect
of the AVs are the challenges

48
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:56,414
we face in the AV vehicles.

49
00:02:57,334 --> 00:02:59,294
Those topics will be
covered by my colleague.

50
00:02:59,794 --> 00:03:00,794
Thank you, Spandana.

51
00:03:01,004 --> 00:03:02,594
I'm Govardhan Reddy Kothinti.

52
00:03:02,664 --> 00:03:05,604
I'm currently, currently
serving as a Functional Safety

53
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:08,384
Manager, at Aptiv LLC, PLC.

54
00:03:08,874 --> 00:03:12,704
I have over 18 years of experience
in the developing of the critical

55
00:03:12,954 --> 00:03:17,304
systems, embedded systems, as well
as avionics and autonomous systems.

56
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:21,244
I had a, I had an opportunity and
privilege working on the safety

57
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:25,574
critical systems and adaptation of
AB into these, autonomous vehicles.

58
00:03:25,964 --> 00:03:30,464
I'll be covering the challenges related
to the cybersecurity infrastructure

59
00:03:30,464 --> 00:03:36,064
needs and societal implications of
the autonomous technologies coming to

60
00:03:36,094 --> 00:03:38,724
the challenges of the a VA adaption.

61
00:03:39,394 --> 00:03:44,344
While the AV, benefits of the AV are
clear, widespread, adaptation of these

62
00:03:44,354 --> 00:03:46,134
vehicles face significant challenges.

63
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:49,144
One of the primary obstacle
is with the regulations.

64
00:03:49,594 --> 00:03:53,164
there are the regulatory,
things are like uncertainty.

65
00:03:53,364 --> 00:03:56,934
We currently have state specific
regulation for testing of the AVs.

66
00:03:57,374 --> 00:04:02,874
but global regulatory frameworks needs to
be established to ensure safety, reliable,

67
00:04:02,924 --> 00:04:08,329
liability issues as well as provide clear
guidelines for the insurance of the AVs.

68
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:13,009
These regulations needs to be
evolved alongside advancements

69
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:14,249
in the AV technology.

70
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:17,529
Coming to the cyber security is
a critical concern of the AVs.

71
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:22,624
These vehicles are interconnected with
cloud based systems and communicate

72
00:04:22,624 --> 00:04:24,234
with the surrounding infrastructure.

73
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,944
This connectivity opens up
multiple vulnerabilities, making

74
00:04:27,944 --> 00:04:30,284
AVs suspectable to cyber attacks.

75
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:35,664
Strong encryption and intrusion detection
systems are essential to protect

76
00:04:35,664 --> 00:04:37,624
these vehicles from potential threats.

77
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,514
Furthermore, the infrastructure
needs to support AVs.

78
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:45,954
such as, smart roads, 5Get work
requires significant investments

79
00:04:46,404 --> 00:04:51,714
to ensure that a safe and efficient
operation to the environmental impact.

80
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:55,804
particular electronics, Electric
Autonomous Vehicles which are

81
00:04:55,804 --> 00:05:00,354
called EAVs, they can offer
substantial environmental benefits.

82
00:05:00,794 --> 00:05:05,094
By optimizing driving patterns,
reducing congestion, EVs can

83
00:05:05,224 --> 00:05:07,104
reduce fuel consumption by 60%.

84
00:05:07,604 --> 00:05:12,504
Additionally, EAVs contributes to
cleaner air by eliminating, tailpipe

85
00:05:12,754 --> 00:05:17,124
emissions, making them a key component
in the fight against urban population.

86
00:05:17,304 --> 00:05:20,934
Coming to the ethical and
social considerations.

87
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:25,899
Ethical concerns around AVs are
significant, especially in avoiding

88
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:28,009
unavoidable accident scenarios.

89
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:31,799
How should an AV decide who
to prioritize in an emergency?

90
00:05:32,489 --> 00:05:35,879
This trolley problem is a key
challenge in the AV development.

91
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:42,009
And another important issue is the privacy
of the data generated by these AVs.

92
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:47,529
These vehicles collect a vast amount
of data, including location, behavior,

93
00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:50,009
and environmental information.

94
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:54,619
And it is vital that this data is
protected and used responsibility

95
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:56,209
to ensure the public trust.

96
00:05:56,709 --> 00:06:02,029
Coming to the social equity and public
trust, as AV technologies become more

97
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:07,439
prevalent, it is essential to ensure the
benefits of AVs reach all communities.

98
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:10,794
Especially undeserved or
the vulnerable groups.

99
00:06:11,294 --> 00:06:15,354
AVIS holds the promise of increasing
accessibility particularly for

100
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:20,294
the individuals who face mobility
challenges such as elderly and disabled.

101
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:24,324
These groups stand to benefit
from the reduced transportation

102
00:06:24,364 --> 00:06:28,694
costs and the availability of on
demand shared mobility services.

103
00:06:29,194 --> 00:06:33,969
However, we must also be cautious
how AVs impact employment in

104
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:36,059
sectors that rely on human drivers.

105
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:42,069
The potential for the job displacement
is a real concern and it is Crucial to

106
00:06:42,109 --> 00:06:47,139
invest in retaining programs to help
the workers transition to a new roles

107
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:52,619
in the AV ecosystem At the same time
we must ensure that the AV benefits

108
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:59,249
such as enhanced mobility Improved air
quality and safe roads are Equitably

109
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:04,369
distributed, particularly in rural
or economically disadvantaged areas.

110
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:10,139
To conclude, while autonomous vehicles
offer transformative potential, enhanced

111
00:07:10,369 --> 00:07:15,959
safety, reducing congestion, and promoting
environmental sustainability, we must

112
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,269
address the challenges that lie ahead.

113
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:23,059
Key areas such as regulatory
adaption, technological infrastructure

114
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:26,509
development, and public education
and acceptance will be critical

115
00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:28,449
to realize the benefits of these.

116
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:30,514
AVs on the Global scale.

117
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:35,584
Governments, industries and researchers
must work together to create a

118
00:07:35,584 --> 00:07:40,394
seamless integration of AVs into this
existing transportation ecosystem.

119
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:44,144
Looking forward, the success
of the AVs will depend on the

120
00:07:44,174 --> 00:07:48,544
collaboration among the governments,
industry leaders, and researchers.

121
00:07:49,044 --> 00:07:53,384
By working together to adhere to the
challenges, we can ensure that the

122
00:07:53,424 --> 00:07:58,104
AV technology will benefit everyone
from reducing the traffic congestion

123
00:07:58,184 --> 00:08:03,134
and lowering emissions to improve the
safety and increasing accessibility.

124
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:09,924
The future of the AVC is bright, but it
will be required to continue effort and

125
00:08:09,944 --> 00:08:12,384
innovation from all the sections involved.

126
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:16,709
