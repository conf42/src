1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,410
Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,989
I'm from Microsoft and I'm
thrilled to be here at Comp 42.

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,809
Network engineering, as many of has
traditionally been about cables, routers,

4
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:15,355
and keeping systems online, but today
that world is being completely redefined.

5
00:00:15,855 --> 00:00:19,295
We're entering an era where
AI isn't supporting just the

6
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:20,815
network, it's actively running it.

7
00:00:21,315 --> 00:00:25,725
Optimizing performance, predicting
failures and adapting on the fly.

8
00:00:26,224 --> 00:00:31,264
In this talk, I'll explore how AI is
reshaping network engineering, what new

9
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:35,914
skills we need and how we can design
scalable, reliable, and intelligent

10
00:00:35,914 --> 00:00:38,464
networks for this AI driven future.

11
00:00:38,964 --> 00:00:41,489
Let's start with how our
field have has evolved.

12
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:44,509
A traditional approach
was straightforward.

13
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:48,979
Manually configured devices,
monitor up time and react to

14
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:50,719
problems when something broke.

15
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:54,940
If a router failed at 2:00
AM someone got a call.

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,930
Today, we have shifted to a modern
paradigm where intelligent systems

17
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,970
can predict issues before they
occur, optimize themselves and

18
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,229
make decisions based on data.

19
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:11,589
For instance, modern data centers can
now automatically reconfigure traffic

20
00:01:11,589 --> 00:01:17,570
patterns or, and the paths basically
when latency is noticed on a particular

21
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,299
path with no human in the loop.

22
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:25,279
So the role of network engineer
has changed from being an operator

23
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:29,989
to becoming a systems architect
and a data driven strategist.

24
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:35,519
Network engineers must span three
worlds, enterprise networks, cloud

25
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:37,829
providers, and telecom operators.

26
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,629
Enterprises care most about
compliance of time and security.

27
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:47,199
Think of a global bank that
must follow strict regulations

28
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:49,069
that keep trading systems live.

29
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:55,374
24 7. Cloud providers and put
emphasize automation and elasticity.

30
00:01:55,854 --> 00:01:59,634
Companies like Microsoft Azure
or AWS need networks that scale

31
00:01:59,694 --> 00:02:01,584
across continents automatically.

32
00:02:02,084 --> 00:02:06,164
Telephone operators handle massive
traffic and cardiac great reliability.

33
00:02:06,914 --> 00:02:10,514
Imagine managing billions of
iot connections simultaneously.

34
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:14,435
Each network is unique, yet
they are deeply interconnected.

35
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:18,535
The future engineer must pay
fuel fluent in all these three.

36
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:23,145
In enterprise environments, the challenge
is balancing reliability and regulation.

37
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:27,670
Networks must meet audit data
sovereignty and zero trust

38
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,550
requirements while staying efficient.

39
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,760
For example, a healthcare company
integrating patient data across multiple

40
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,190
clouds must ensure HIPAA complaints
without slowing access to doctors.

41
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:45,010
Engineers have to design architectures
that maintain redundancy, security

42
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,900
and performance, all while supporting
legacy systems that were never meant

43
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,300
to talk to modern cloud services.

44
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,195
It is like renovating an old
house while keeping the lights on.

45
00:02:56,765 --> 00:02:58,445
You can't afford downtime

46
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,165
in cloud and service provider spaces.

47
00:03:01,165 --> 00:03:03,145
Speed and scale is everything.

48
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:08,295
Four imperatives that define this
environment first is automation.

49
00:03:08,795 --> 00:03:12,695
Tools like Terraform or Ansible
replace manual configuration.

50
00:03:13,385 --> 00:03:18,565
You can deploy hundreds of routers with
a single script orchestration and scale.

51
00:03:19,495 --> 00:03:24,115
Managing thousands of network nodes
require systems like Kubernetes

52
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,655
for networking to maintain
consistency and reliability,

53
00:03:28,155 --> 00:03:30,875
performance optimization Subsequent.

54
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,590
Latency can be made or can be
make or break applications like

55
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,830
online gaming or stock trading.

56
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:44,010
Elastic scaling networks must
expand and contract based on demand.

57
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,830
Think of video streaming traffic
spiking during a major sports event.

58
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:53,380
AI ties these together, helping us
make real time data driven adjustments.

59
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,150
Now let's ground ourselves in the
core skills that still matter.

60
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,580
AI can optimize configurations, but
it can't replace deep understanding of

61
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,870
writing protocols like BGP or SPF and
MBLS, for example, when AI recommends

62
00:04:07,105 --> 00:04:12,925
the route change, engineers must
interpret, why is it improving latency

63
00:04:13,225 --> 00:04:15,470
or masking and underlying topology issue?

64
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,620
Likewise, IPV six.

65
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,470
Security and observability are becoming
fundamental with billions of iot devices.

66
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,640
Joining networks IIPV
four is simply not enough.

67
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:32,490
So while AI helps automate
and enhance our foundational

68
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,480
knowledge remains our compass,

69
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,840
the network engineer of
tomorrow is a hybrid.

70
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,140
Part network architect, part software
developer, part data analyst.

71
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:47,020
Beyond Protocol Mastery, we need
programming, fluency, AI literacy,

72
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,180
and data interpretation skills.

73
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:54,875
For instance, when AI models suggests
optimizing bandwidth based on telemetry

74
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,340
data, you should understand how
that model learned, what features it

75
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,130
used, and what biases might exist.

76
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,990
The more we understand ai, the
better we can collaborate with it.

77
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,880
Turning the engineer into an
AI co-pilot, not a spectator.

78
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,930
The toolbox of a motor
engineer looks very different.

79
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:22,310
Now we are seeing tools like Ansible,
Terraform, net, and Napalm, all

80
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,860
focused on automating repetitive tasks.

81
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,920
If you add Python, yaml, js O and
jet this is now the new command line.

82
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:36,250
Picture this, instead of configuring one
switch at a time, you push a GI commit

83
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,410
and the change deploy across hundreds of
devices, which validation checks built in.

84
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,810
That's why the new
baseline is clear Python.

85
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,695
Get Ansible APIs.

86
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:55,335
SGN controllers, these are the keys to
building intelligence scalable systems.

87
00:05:55,835 --> 00:05:58,985
AI is already deeply embedded
in network operations.

88
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:04,255
It helps with the anomaly detection,
spotting unusual spikes in traffic

89
00:06:04,345 --> 00:06:05,335
that might signal an attack.

90
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:10,635
Predictive maintenance, identifying
ports or links likely to fail soon.

91
00:06:11,135 --> 00:06:16,415
Root cause analysis, correlating thousands
of logs in seconds to find the issue.

92
00:06:16,915 --> 00:06:21,605
Without ai these tasks will become
humongous and take a lot of time.

93
00:06:21,605 --> 00:06:25,790
But with the help of AI, we are
able to scale up much better and

94
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,550
root cause it much more efficiently.

95
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,430
A real world example is a global
Telco used an AI to detect

96
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,450
wifi degradation across regions
before customers ever noticed.

97
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,540
Serving millions in support calls
these capabilities transform

98
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,385
operations from reactive to proactive,
from firefighting to forecasting.

99
00:06:47,885 --> 00:06:50,135
The shift AI drinks is not incremental.

100
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:56,365
It's transformational tasks that took
hours like sifting through telemetry data

101
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:58,885
now happen continuously and automatically.

102
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:05,025
AI systems analyze traffic behavior,
link health and security patterns to

103
00:07:05,115 --> 00:07:07,605
adjust configurations in real time.

104
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,780
Imagine a network that knows
peak hours for your app.

105
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,520
Reallocate bandwidth and tunes,
quality of service parameters

106
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,500
before condition actually happens.

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,760
That's the power of moving from monitor
and react to anticipate and adapt.

108
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,590
Self optimizing networks
are where AI truly shines.

109
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,550
These are systems that can self-diagnose.

110
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,070
Radar out traffic around failures, and
even heal themselves automatically.

111
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:41,580
For instance, if a link in Singapore
fails and the network could re out through

112
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:46,640
Tokyo in milliseconds without anyone
touching a console, the impact is massive.

113
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,480
Reduce downtime, faster
resolution, and lower costs.

114
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,605
But autonomy must come with guardrails.

115
00:07:53,995 --> 00:07:56,095
Engineers must define safety limits.

116
00:07:56,595 --> 00:08:01,555
Like what an AI can change to
avoid any unintended consequences.

117
00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:05,685
So this definition of guardrails
and how you put safety checks

118
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,755
in place is pretty important.

119
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,755
And this brings us to
a cri critical truth.

120
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:14,205
AI can enhance, but not
replace human expertise.

121
00:08:14,705 --> 00:08:15,605
A lacks context.

122
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,240
It doesn't understand business goals,
regulations, or organization culture.

123
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,660
For example, an AI might flag a large data
transfer as security threat, but a human

124
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,880
knows it's a sanctioned quarterly backup.

125
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,040
The best networks come from
AI plus human collaboration.

126
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,430
AI accelerates analysis.

127
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,115
Humans provide judgment,
strategy and ethical oversight.

128
00:08:39,615 --> 00:08:44,745
As engineers, we remain the interpreters
and architects behind the intelligence

129
00:08:45,245 --> 00:08:45,605
feature.

130
00:08:45,605 --> 00:08:50,945
Ready networks are modular, API,
driven and observable by design.

131
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,420
A PA first design allows systems
to integrate and automate easily.

132
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,800
Microservices architecture
ensures scalability.

133
00:09:00,685 --> 00:09:04,015
You can upgrade one service without
taking the entire system down.

134
00:09:04,515 --> 00:09:08,625
Declarative configuration lets
you describe the desired state.

135
00:09:09,075 --> 00:09:14,625
Instead of typing imperative comments,
the system figures out how to get there.

136
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:20,045
Observability by default, gives AI the
data it needs to learn and improve.

137
00:09:20,545 --> 00:09:26,244
Think of it as moving from a static
machine to a living evolving organism.

138
00:09:26,744 --> 00:09:29,744
Scalability and resiliency aren't add-ons.

139
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:31,964
They must be baked into the architecture.

140
00:09:32,464 --> 00:09:36,545
Horizontal scaling adds
more nodes, not bigger ones.

141
00:09:37,265 --> 00:09:40,525
Stateless design reduces dependencies.

142
00:09:41,025 --> 00:09:42,375
Graceful degradation.

143
00:09:42,855 --> 00:09:47,880
If one part fails, the system
still runs, even if partially.

144
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,550
Chaos engineering deliberately
breaking things and testing to

145
00:09:52,819 --> 00:09:54,620
build confidence and recovery.

146
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,160
Netflix popularized this idea.

147
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:02,540
Their Chaos Monkey tool randomly
shuts down systems to test resiliency.

148
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,735
Networks need the same philosophy.

149
00:10:04,845 --> 00:10:07,335
Plan for failure and design for recovery.

150
00:10:07,835 --> 00:10:08,825
So how do we get there?

151
00:10:08,915 --> 00:10:10,415
Here's a five step roadmap.

152
00:10:10,915 --> 00:10:16,975
Assess current state, identify where AI
can help, and what skills your team lacks.

153
00:10:17,905 --> 00:10:22,365
Build the foundation, automate
repetitive tasks and collect telemetry.

154
00:10:22,865 --> 00:10:24,395
Pilot AI solutions.

155
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:27,910
Try AI in low risk areas
like anomaly detection.

156
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,520
Scale intelligently, which
is like bringing successful

157
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,810
pilots into production.

158
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,470
Monitor results and refine
them, iterate over them.

159
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,310
Foster innovation, encourage learning
hackathons, and crossed in collaboration.

160
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,355
This journey is iterative.

161
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:46,755
Each phase strengthens the next.

162
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:49,965
It's evaluation, not revolution.

163
00:10:50,465 --> 00:10:53,005
To wrap up, master the fundamentals.

164
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:55,585
Deep protocol knowledge
never goes out of style.

165
00:10:56,085 --> 00:10:57,405
Embrace continuous learning.

166
00:10:57,765 --> 00:11:00,015
AI and automation evolve quickly.

167
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:03,635
Stay curious, think architecturally.

168
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,705
Design for adaptability and scale.

169
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:08,335
From day one, collaborate
across disciplines.

170
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,470
The best results come from networking
software and data teams working together.

171
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,780
The future of network engineering
isn't about replacing people with ai.

172
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:23,240
It's about augmenting our intelligence,
creating systems that learn,

173
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,210
adapt, and evolve alongside us.

174
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:29,980
Thank you all and I hope this
inspires you to start building

175
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,015
tomorrow's networks today.

176
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,055
Thank you.
