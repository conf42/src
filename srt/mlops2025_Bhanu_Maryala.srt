00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,460
Hello everyone, and welcome to my
session on automating AI ethics for

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,680
ML Ops Native Data Governance for
production ready generative AI pipelines.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,300
My name is Nu Mariela, and over
the next 20 minutes I'll walk you

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,170
through the governance challenges
that enterprises face today with

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,390
the generative AI and how ML lops
native approaches can turn compliance

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,910
from a bottleneck into an advantage.

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,060
A little bit about myself.

8
00:00:29,299 --> 00:00:32,839
I specialize in ML ops, data
governance and AI ethics.

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:38,390
My focus is on building responsible,
scalable AI systems across platforms

10
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,779
like AWS, Azure GCP, and Snowflake.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,110
Over the years I've worked on deploying
enterprise AI solutions that not only meet

12
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,625
the performance goal, but also add the
air to strict regulatory requirements.

13
00:00:53,464 --> 00:00:58,595
My mission is to transform governance from
being a hurdle into a strategic asset.

14
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:05,275
Now, when we think about governance in ai,
organizations often face three different

15
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:07,645
trade offs, speed versus complaints.

16
00:01:07,645 --> 00:01:12,400
Now, how do we deploy fast without
the checks tracking challenges?

17
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:15,715
Now, data provenance gets
harder as data sets scale.

18
00:01:16,705 --> 00:01:22,675
Now regulatory burden navigating multiple
jurisdictions without slowing innovations.

19
00:01:23,305 --> 00:01:28,375
Now this can create a tension like
should we move fast or stay compliant?

20
00:01:28,795 --> 00:01:30,805
The answer, of course, should be both.

21
00:01:31,304 --> 00:01:38,055
Now, introducing the TDED framework,
which means there is exactly where

22
00:01:38,055 --> 00:01:41,670
the training data declarations
or the TDD framework comes in.

23
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,180
So unlike traditional governance, TDD is
embedded directly into the CICD pipelines.

24
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,030
Now that means compliance monitoring
happens automatically in real time

25
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,860
without slowing down deployments or
requiring major infrastructure changes.

26
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,340
Now the five different features of
the TDD framework are a four tier

27
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,270
classification system that can
categorize data by risk and provenance.

28
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,590
Number two is the
standard metadata schema.

29
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,040
So every system speaks the
same governance language.

30
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,830
Number three is real-time risk assessment.

31
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:23,180
Now evaluating risk continuously
during the training and deployment.

32
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,350
Number four is comprehensive audit
trails, which can leave the regulators

33
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,120
with a complete compliance regard.

34
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,470
Now together these make the
governance scalable and frictionless.

35
00:02:35,265 --> 00:02:41,025
Now in practice, we've implemented
these approaches across AWS

36
00:02:41,085 --> 00:02:43,275
Azure, GCP, and Snowflake.

37
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:48,675
Some of the strategies included
container native governance tools or

38
00:02:48,675 --> 00:02:54,045
automated policy enforcements within the
Kubernetes platform and monitoring the

39
00:02:54,045 --> 00:02:56,265
dashboards for real-time verification.

40
00:02:56,625 --> 00:03:02,955
The key is that governance travels with
a model wherever it's deployed now.

41
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,310
Different regions has different rules.

42
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,050
Now, TDD framework supports
jurisdiction specific automation.

43
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,180
It can adapt to regional compliance
needs, manage cross border data

44
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,100
flows, and ensure scalability
without sacrificing the compliance.

45
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:26,110
Now, this is especially important for
global enterprises that operate across

46
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,030
multiple regulatory environments.

47
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:34,230
Now one big governance
gap is the licensing part.

48
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:39,630
Now many training assets or data
sets that included copyrighted

49
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,269
or ambiguously licensed material.

50
00:03:42,899 --> 00:03:47,549
With TDD, we add automated
license detection, risk

51
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:49,859
evaluation, and also remediation.

52
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,065
And this happens all before deployment.

53
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:58,175
And this turns what could be a legal
nightmare into a manageable process.

54
00:03:58,775 --> 00:04:04,625
So I want to leave you this session
with three practical takeaways.

55
00:04:05,165 --> 00:04:08,255
Number one, ready to deploy code samples.

56
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:13,595
You can adapt right away architectural
patterns for integrating governance

57
00:04:13,655 --> 00:04:16,205
into existing ML ops workflows.

58
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,715
And last, the velocity enhancing strategy.

59
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:26,920
Now governance that increases speed
can rather has or than slowing it down.

60
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,820
So this is exactly governance.

61
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,740
It's not about reducing the risk.

62
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,359
If it done right, it actually
accelerates the innovation now

63
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:43,409
by removing the uncertainty
and making all the rules clear.

64
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:49,020
You free teams that can innovate
without fear for non-compliance,

65
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,640
and that's how compliance
becomes a competitive advantage.

66
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:59,380
Now let's take a closer look
at how TDD works in practice.

67
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,270
Now, the four tier classification
system helps us categorize data

68
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,490
sets based on the risk level from a
highly trusted to restricted sources.

69
00:05:09,895 --> 00:05:14,305
This enables precise management
of sensitive data and

70
00:05:14,305 --> 00:05:16,045
tailored governance controls.

71
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:22,995
And in addition to classification,
we use standardized metadata schema

72
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:27,765
so that all data sets carry uniform
governance information such as

73
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:29,969
licensing and transformation history.

74
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:35,099
Now this standardization ensures
that consistent compliance

75
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,619
tracking across all the systems.

76
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:45,499
Now container native governance tools also
allow policies and compliance checks to

77
00:05:45,499 --> 00:05:51,739
travel with workloads, ensuring consistent
governance, whether models run on premise.

78
00:05:52,264 --> 00:05:58,284
In hybrid setups or across multiple
clouds, and there's also Kubernetes

79
00:05:58,335 --> 00:06:02,655
based enforcement that can completely
automate all the compliance

80
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:07,815
verification at multiple stages
before, during, and after deployment.

81
00:06:08,205 --> 00:06:12,284
That can completely minimize
manual intervention and also

82
00:06:12,284 --> 00:06:13,674
reducing risk of human error.

83
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:17,144
And dashboards play a very critical part.

84
00:06:17,414 --> 00:06:21,044
It can provide continuous
compliance verification with

85
00:06:21,044 --> 00:06:23,684
near instant validation feedback.

86
00:06:24,044 --> 00:06:29,714
Now this can enable teams to monitor
governance status in real time and

87
00:06:29,714 --> 00:06:35,815
also quickly address any issues
and talking about the real time the

88
00:06:35,815 --> 00:06:40,294
real time risk assessment tools,
continuously monitor data and model risk.

89
00:06:40,975 --> 00:06:46,405
From ingestion through runtime making
governance, proactive by identifying

90
00:06:46,735 --> 00:06:51,235
the potential compliance gaps
before they even become problems.

91
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:56,215
Now, let me explain a case
study in a financial services.

92
00:06:56,715 --> 00:07:03,795
So a major financial institution wanted to
deploy generative AI for customer service,

93
00:07:04,035 --> 00:07:06,675
but it faced very strict regulations.

94
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,510
By implementing TDD with industry
specific governance rules and compliance

95
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:18,960
checks, they cut compliance review time
by 87%, while also maintaining the a

96
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,330
hundred percent regulatory adherence.

97
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,330
That's governance automation in action.

98
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,900
Now, when it comes to cross cloud
implementation, TDD is very flexible

99
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,780
across all the cloud providers on AWS.

100
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:39,095
It uses S3 Lambda and SageMaker on Azure.

101
00:07:39,155 --> 00:07:45,185
It uses blob storage functions
and machine learning on GCP.

102
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:51,550
It uses cloud storage functions and
Vertex ai and with snowflake governance

103
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,830
extends through native procedures.

104
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:59,360
So regardless of your cloud
strategy, TDD can be integrated.

105
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:06,240
Now here's a small snippet of the
Python for automated license detection.

106
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:13,380
It shows how TDD scans, directories,
validates policies, and also

107
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,599
flags the risks before deployment.

108
00:08:16,109 --> 00:08:21,540
This is just one example of how
easy it is to bring governance into

109
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,310
your workflows programmatically.

110
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:31,715
Now finally, here's how TDD fits into
the ML ops pipeline at ingestion.

111
00:08:31,805 --> 00:08:37,115
The metadata collection actually
starts during the pre-processing stage.

112
00:08:37,505 --> 00:08:40,115
That is exactly where the
governance checks run.

113
00:08:40,684 --> 00:08:45,454
In training, the lineage is
tracked from end-to-end before

114
00:08:45,454 --> 00:08:47,075
validation and deployment.

115
00:08:47,165 --> 00:08:48,724
The compliance is verified.

116
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:54,815
And finally in production monitoring
ensures ongoing complaints.

117
00:08:54,845 --> 00:08:58,505
So this way, governance
is built in end-to-end.

118
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:03,745
So finally, to wrap up, governance
doesn't have to be a burden.

119
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:09,205
With a training data declarations,
framework, enterprises can truly

120
00:09:09,205 --> 00:09:14,245
accelerate deployment, reduce
legal and regulatory risks, build

121
00:09:14,245 --> 00:09:15,295
trust with the stakeholders.

122
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:20,125
And gain a sustainable
competitive advantage.

123
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,795
