Today, I will share one of our
most impactful implementations.

8
00:00:27,035 --> 00:00:30,874
Healthcare analytics and
that is platform engineering.

9
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:35,095
At scale building cloud native
data infrastructure for one

10
00:00:35,095 --> 00:00:37,015
40 terabyte of data monthly.

11
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,500
Healthcare analytics.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,815
Healthcare organizations

13
00:00:41,315 --> 00:00:43,385
face unique data engineering challenges.

14
00:00:43,925 --> 00:00:48,815
Managing hundreds of terabytes of
sensitive data monthly while maintaining

15
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:54,225
HIPAA and GDPR compliance create
significant complexity combined with

16
00:00:54,225 --> 00:01:00,105
legacy system constraints, demands for
self-service analytics, and the need

17
00:01:00,105 --> 00:01:02,805
to integrate diverse data domains.

18
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:09,375
These challenges directly impact
medical innovation and patient care.

19
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:14,535
Modern platform engineering
solutions have become essential to

20
00:01:14,535 --> 00:01:16,335
address these critical barriers.

21
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:23,275
As a Fortune 500 biopharma company, legacy
infrastructure, severely constrained

22
00:01:23,455 --> 00:01:30,295
research capabilities, the platform
access only 15% of available healthcare

23
00:01:30,295 --> 00:01:35,455
data sources with the researchers
facing two hour query rate times.

24
00:01:35,955 --> 00:01:41,384
The monolithic system couldn't scale to
meet growing data demands effectively

25
00:01:41,384 --> 00:01:46,755
limiting innovation and delay
potential medical break breakthroughs.

26
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:52,185
Our platform engineering transformation,
increased month monthly processing

27
00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:57,525
capacity from 15 terabyte to one
40 terabyte reducing processing

28
00:01:57,525 --> 00:02:03,930
time by 80% and accelerating drug
discovery timelines by 4.2 months per.

29
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,410
We developed a platform as a product
approach, treating infrastructure

30
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,820
as a product with research and
clinical teams as customers.

31
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,359
By implementing self-service capabilities
and automation, we achieved 67%

32
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:24,140
faster development velocity and
reduced processing time by 80%.

33
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,780

code while enabling team to access

35
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,480
resource without engineering bottlenecks.

36
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:41,000
This transformation delivered $2.3 million
in annual cost savings and increased

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,030
workload capacity, demonstrating the
value of treating platforms as products

38
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,595
rather than just infrastructure.

39
00:02:48,095 --> 00:02:53,285
Our healthcare data platform leverages
a W Services to process our one 40

40
00:02:53,285 --> 00:02:55,685
terabyte of monthly data efficiently.

41
00:02:56,185 --> 00:03:00,445
Through automated e retail pipelines,
multi-zone data architecture, and

42
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:05,365

achieved an 80% reduction in processing

43
00:03:05,365 --> 00:03:11,120
time, the platforms metadata driven
framework, and choose data quality

44
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,800
while maintaining HIPAA compliance.

45
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:19,350
Through built-in security controls,
this architecture uses S3 Amazon

46
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:25,830
Redshift to store to access the data
and Amazon S3 to store the data.

47
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:31,050
There is also addition layer in
between, which is nothing but the

48
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,640
copy command you can use to load data
directly into the Amazon Redshift.

49
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,950
Our INFRAS infrastructure as code
approach integrates compliance

50
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,700
and automation directly into our
development deployment pipelines.

51
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,890
Through automated infrastructure
provisioning and self-service capabilities

52
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:53,450
we have achieved faster developer velocity
and seamless scaling from 15 terabyte

53
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,910
to one 40 terabyte monthly capacity.

00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,090
Platform's compliance as code approach
and embeds regulatory requirements

55
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,530
infrastructure, while automated
scaling and optimization have delivered

56
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,130
major cost, annual cost savings.

57
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,380
This transformation reduce deployment
times while maintaining consistent

58
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,960
security controls across environments.

59
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,790
Our platform engineering
initiatives delivered significant

60
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,470
outcomes across key metrics.

61
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,580
We achieved an 80% reduction in
processing time through automation,

62
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:31,275
increased workload capacity by
three 40%, and realized $2.3

63
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:32,905
million in annual cost savings.

64
00:04:33,405 --> 00:04:38,535
Developer velocity improved by 67%
