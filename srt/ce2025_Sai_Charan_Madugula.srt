00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,600
My name is Sai Chiran, and it's an
absolute honor to be here today.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,880
I'm excited to discuss a transformative
shift in the networking world.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,140
One that is redefining how
we design, build and manage

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,450
modern communication systems.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,600
As technology rapidly evolves, the
demand for scalable, intelligent and

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,740
efficient networks has never been greater.

Today, we will explore the innovations
shaping this new era and how they are

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,829
driving the future of connectivity.

10
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,390
In today's hyper connected era,
we are witnessing an explosion of

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,170
connected devices from billions of IoT
sensors in smart homes and industrial

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,850
automation to autonomous vehicles and
cloud gaming and remote healthcare.

13
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:42,874
This unprecedented growth is driving
a massive shift in how networks must

14
00:00:42,874 --> 00:00:44,595
be designed, deployed, and optimized.

15
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,074
The challenge is clear.

16
00:00:46,315 --> 00:00:50,025
Traditional networking architectures,
rigid, static, and complex are

17
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:53,514
no longer capable of meeting the
dynamic, high performance, and

18
00:00:53,534 --> 00:00:57,495
intelligent networking requirements
of IoT and 5G driven ecosystems.

19
00:00:57,985 --> 00:01:01,315
This is where SDN, software defined
networking, comes into play.

20
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:05,575
A game changing paradigm that
brings agility, scalability, and

21
00:01:05,594 --> 00:01:07,424
intelligence to network infrastructure.

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,600
SDN, separate network control from
physical hardware, enabling more flexible,

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,440
programmable and efficient networks.

24
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:18,079
Today, I'll take you through how
software defined networking is

25
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:23,579
transforming networking in the IoT and
5G era and real world use cases and

26
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:27,359
benefits, along with the challenges
and solutions in implementing SDN.

27
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:31,759
and the future of connected intelligence
with software defined networking.

28
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:36,239
Now, let's discuss more about the
paradigm shift in network architecture.

29
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,929
Let's first understand what makes
SDN such a revolutionary shift.

30
00:01:41,444 --> 00:01:44,044
Traditional networking versus
software defined networking.

31
00:01:44,424 --> 00:01:47,814
For decades, network infrastructure
followed a hardware centric,

32
00:01:48,104 --> 00:01:49,674
manual configuration approach.

33
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:53,894
Each switch, router, or firewall
had to be configured individually,

34
00:01:54,184 --> 00:01:57,874
leading to complexity, slow
response times, and inefficiencies.

35
00:01:58,424 --> 00:02:02,254
Software defined networking disrupts
this model by separating the control

36
00:02:02,254 --> 00:02:06,274
plane which makes decisions about traffic
routing from the data plane, which

37
00:02:06,274 --> 00:02:08,324
forwards traffic based on those decisions.

38
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:13,614
This enables centralized control,
allowing network administrators to manage,

39
00:02:13,654 --> 00:02:17,584
optimize, and automate the entire network
through software based controllers.

40
00:02:18,274 --> 00:02:23,004
Now, let's jump into why is software
defined networking a game changer.

41
00:02:23,504 --> 00:02:27,824
Centralized control, programmability,
automation, and cost reduction.

42
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:32,164
centralized control, which eliminates
manual configurations, reducing

43
00:02:32,164 --> 00:02:33,574
complexity and human error.

44
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:38,054
Network can be dynamically adjusted
based on real time conditions by

45
00:02:38,064 --> 00:02:41,414
self optimizing networks ensure
efficient resource allocation.

46
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:46,409
With manual intervention by embracing
software defined networking networks

47
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:51,419
become dynamic flexible and intelligent
Making them ideal for modern applications

48
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:59,299
like iot and 5g Let's also discuss about
addressing the growth demands for iot In

49
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:04,269
software defined network, the Internet
of Things, IOT is transforming industries

50
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:08,509
from healthcare and manufacturing to
smart cities and autonomous systems.

51
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:13,939
However, IOT also brings significant
networking challenges such as

52
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,479
scalability, security, and latency.

53
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:21,159
In scalability, how do we support
billions of connected devices?

54
00:03:21,374 --> 00:03:22,824
while maintaining performance.

55
00:03:23,314 --> 00:03:26,304
How do we protect IoT
devices from cyber threats?

56
00:03:26,694 --> 00:03:30,414
How do we ensure real time
responsiveness for mission critical

57
00:03:30,414 --> 00:03:34,024
applications like autonomous
vehicles and industrial automation?

58
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:38,679
These are the challenges software
defined networking will address.

59
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:45,229
Software optimizes bandwidth allocation
and traffic management dynamically.

60
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:50,309
This ensures that networks can support
millions of IoT devices with congestion.

61
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:54,619
traditional networks take weeks
to adjust to new demands with

62
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:58,149
software defined Networking
automation and policy based control.

63
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:02,089
Network configurations can be
changed instantly to accommodate new

64
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:04,269
IoT services and security updates.

65
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:08,389

With SDN, the rollout of 5G brings
ultra high speed connectivity, ultra

70
00:04:26,974 --> 00:04:29,044
low latency and massive device density.

71
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:33,224
But these capabilities can't
be fully realized without

72
00:04:33,234 --> 00:04:34,634
intelligent network management.

73
00:04:34,894 --> 00:04:38,694
This is where SDN enhances
5G network slicing.

74
00:04:39,044 --> 00:04:44,534
