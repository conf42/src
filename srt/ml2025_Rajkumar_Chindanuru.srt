1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,460
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,620
Good morning, good evening,
and good afternoon.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:09,580
My name is Raach Ma. I have around
20 years of IT experience providing

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,999
solutions to various business domains
like healthcare, manufacturing, retail.

5
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:18,520
All these years like I have
contributed to legacy application

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,380
modernization, digital transformation.

7
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:22,599
I would say that's my
core area of expertise.

8
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:23,389
So if.

9
00:00:24,664 --> 00:00:29,499
Already working on legacy platforms and
you are in the process of modernizing it.

10
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:31,139
Then you are in the right place.

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,459
So in the next couple of minutes
we will talk about how a powered

12
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:37,910
solutions would help us in
transforming these legacy systems.

13
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:40,039
That's about my quick introduction.

14
00:00:40,279 --> 00:00:44,059
If you have any questions after the
presentation, you can please feel free to

15
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:47,449
reach out to Arch in the neuro@gmail.com.

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:48,669
Yep.

17
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,949
Let's write a bit jump
into the presentation.

18
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:54,199
All right.

19
00:00:54,349 --> 00:00:58,569
So like I mentioned many of us in
our career would've worked with many

20
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:02,709
legacy applications and systems,
and we all know so much business

21
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:04,779
value would've been tied so tightly.

22
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:06,669
With these legacy applications.

23
00:01:07,029 --> 00:01:11,419
But what happens when the business
expects these legacy applications to

24
00:01:11,419 --> 00:01:13,129
be meeting today's business needs?

25
00:01:13,179 --> 00:01:16,769
One of us definitely would start
thinking about how I can modernize

26
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:18,239
these legacy applications, right?

27
00:01:18,574 --> 00:01:22,974
And definitely we tend to
follow the proven and the useful

28
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:26,874
conventional approaches, but
sometimes these conventional or the

29
00:01:26,874 --> 00:01:28,524
traditional approaches might not.

30
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:33,094
Might not be good enough to meet the
business expectations or might not give

31
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:35,264
you the desired in income desired result.

32
00:01:35,534 --> 00:01:38,504
So then you will start
looking for the alternatives.

33
00:01:38,554 --> 00:01:42,774
So this is where I talk about, a powered
solution, which is which I call it

34
00:01:42,774 --> 00:01:47,234
as a cognitive retail modernization
framework which will help me like how

35
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:51,284
exactly I can transform these legacy
systems at the same time I can enhance

36
00:01:51,284 --> 00:01:53,754
this customer engagement mechanisms.

37
00:01:54,304 --> 00:01:58,044
So what would be the the approach that
I would want to come with through this

38
00:01:58,074 --> 00:02:02,334
presentation is like it would be an
embedding of cognitive capabilities

39
00:02:02,334 --> 00:02:06,644
with this, legacy systems where
where you will produce a intelligent

40
00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:11,124
hybrid environment that is going
to combine with proven technology

41
00:02:11,124 --> 00:02:12,894
with the advanced AI capabilities.

42
00:02:13,894 --> 00:02:19,354
Okay, so before we, we go down further
into the details, I want to call out what

43
00:02:19,354 --> 00:02:24,194
are the present challenges the industry
may face especially in the retail sector?

44
00:02:24,674 --> 00:02:28,524
So I, based on the research,
what I could read from various

45
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:30,355
articles or my own survey.

46
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:36,454
And it's 70% of these legacy systems
like they are like more than 20 years

47
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:40,045
ago that they have the age as 20 years.

48
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:43,644
Some of these businesses are still
running on these legacy applications.

49
00:02:44,185 --> 00:02:48,924
And I would also see that 70 to
80% of the IT budget is being

50
00:02:48,924 --> 00:02:50,965
contributed towards its maintenance.

51
00:02:51,394 --> 00:02:55,864
Having not having much preference to
the innovation, which is not at all a

52
00:02:55,864 --> 00:02:58,004
good good thing, good sign, I would say.

53
00:02:58,544 --> 00:03:02,594
And 22, I would say like just 20 to 25%.

54
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:07,679
Only 20 to 25% of the data is
being utilized for decision making.

55
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:12,909
I would say today data plays a so vital
role that you have to use as a main key

56
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:14,829
driver for any of your decision making.

57
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:18,729
So I would say these are the,
some of the challenges definitely

58
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:20,839
we should be addressing keeping.

59
00:03:21,024 --> 00:03:24,174
Keeping in mind that conventional
approaches may or may not address

60
00:03:24,174 --> 00:03:25,914
your current business need.

61
00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:29,889
So I have to always call out
for options and alternatives.

62
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:30,129
Yeah.

63
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:35,709
We, for this challenge, what other
options I have to address and then

64
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:37,479
meet today's business expectations.

65
00:03:39,914 --> 00:03:40,204
Okay.

66
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,439
So like I mentioned, we would definitely
try to follow some of the traditional

67
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:48,259
approaches the conventional way of
modernizing these legacy systems.

68
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:52,909
But before we go there, I want to call out
like what limitations that you may face

69
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,309
when you try to deploy these approaches.

70
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:59,549
The first one would be high
risk and uncertains definitely.

71
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:02,839
When you use these traditional
approaches, it is possible

72
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:05,159
that, you may carry heavy risk.

73
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:09,094
Because these applications are
mission critical applications.

74
00:04:09,094 --> 00:04:13,654
Some of them might be, and you'll be
having so much business logic inside that.

75
00:04:13,984 --> 00:04:17,314
And when you use this traditional
approach, you may not really take

76
00:04:17,314 --> 00:04:21,184
the business advantage of that, and
that would definitely be a high risk.

77
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:24,609
And you might not be able to
see the desired outcome of it.

78
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:28,559
And the second thing I would
say it'll be a migration without

79
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,479
transformation, what I meant to say.

80
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:35,349
You are able to migrate it to the
new platform, but you'll still be

81
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:40,474
treating that as a. A modern legacy
system, meaning you are not able to

82
00:04:40,474 --> 00:04:45,174
really achieve what exactly you, you
plan to achieve because though you

83
00:04:45,204 --> 00:04:49,044
follow a traditional modernization
approach using a lift and shift or

84
00:04:49,044 --> 00:04:51,454
rip and replace you might be able to.

85
00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:56,574
Migrate it, but you wouldn't be able
to completely transform the existing

86
00:04:56,574 --> 00:04:59,724
system, and you wouldn't be in a
position to achieve the desired outcome.

87
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:03,464
And the third one is a gradual
improvement without vision.

88
00:05:03,884 --> 00:05:08,564
So though the traditional approach
still suggests that you can apply the

89
00:05:08,564 --> 00:05:13,084
phased manner, but still you wouldn't
really be able to achieve the the

90
00:05:13,084 --> 00:05:14,824
vision that you have planned for it.

91
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:18,514
What I meant to say, we are trying
to do it in incremental fashion,

92
00:05:18,724 --> 00:05:22,264
but still somewhere in at some point
of time, you'll feel that it still

93
00:05:22,264 --> 00:05:26,494
lacks some amount of integration to
give you the holistic picture of it.

94
00:05:26,974 --> 00:05:30,604
So these are the limitations of the
traditional modernization approaches.

95
00:05:31,084 --> 00:05:34,024
Now, having said that,
these are my limitations.

96
00:05:34,024 --> 00:05:35,194
What options do I have?

97
00:05:35,194 --> 00:05:35,734
Let me see.

98
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:38,509
All right.

99
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:42,989
So like I was talking about
though, one option is to use

100
00:05:42,989 --> 00:05:46,409
this conventional approach of
modernizing these legacy systems.

101
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:52,929
What if I try to use this in the, in this
era of AI and ml AI powered, cognitive

102
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:57,189
retail modernization framework and
how exactly is going to help me out.

103
00:05:57,549 --> 00:05:59,169
So what is this framework all about?

104
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:01,929
So what are the various
phases or the layers it has?

105
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:02,679
Let's see here.

106
00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:07,199
So it is primarily would be comprised
of for four different layers.

107
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:08,949
Cognitive layer integration.

108
00:06:09,474 --> 00:06:13,374
Predictive analytics implementation,
hyper-personalization engine

109
00:06:13,584 --> 00:06:14,994
in diligent process automation.

110
00:06:15,324 --> 00:06:17,964
Let us see each of these
layers in a detailed manner.

111
00:06:18,354 --> 00:06:20,964
So what I meant by
cognitive layer integration.

112
00:06:21,284 --> 00:06:25,814
Though you have so much data residing
on these systems, you should be

113
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:28,489
effective position to utilize this data.

114
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:30,404
For a better decision making.

115
00:06:30,794 --> 00:06:34,484
So you should definitely deploy
some intelligent methods or

116
00:06:34,484 --> 00:06:36,554
techniques for processing these data.

117
00:06:36,554 --> 00:06:42,224
Like you can use APIs or even streams
or various approaches so you can use

118
00:06:42,224 --> 00:06:45,444
them and you would, you should be
in a position to effectively utilize

119
00:06:45,664 --> 00:06:47,254
unprocessed these data streams.

120
00:06:47,944 --> 00:06:50,044
And predictive analytics implementation.

121
00:06:50,044 --> 00:06:55,214
What I'm trying to say here so while
you started the processing of data, you

122
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:59,899
should also think about applying various
machine learning approaches through which

123
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:04,759
you can process and produce a results
that can drive you in a better way for,

124
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:09,519
predictive decision making which is
definitely, it is going to be an optimized

125
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,649
way for forecasting these patterns.

126
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:12,759
And then decision making.

127
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,799
So that would be the second layer.

128
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:17,969
And the third one is
hyper-personalization engine.

129
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:23,369
So you have processed the data and you
have applied some machine learning models

130
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:25,199
or the techniques on this process data.

131
00:07:26,604 --> 00:07:29,864
What would be the outcome
of these two approaches?

132
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:35,114
Like you tend to arrive at a stage
where you can tailor, you can use

133
00:07:35,114 --> 00:07:39,124
this process data and you can produce
certain tailored approaches, how you

134
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:42,604
can reach out to the customers and you
can engage them, you can convert them

135
00:07:43,034 --> 00:07:45,154
you can make revenue out of them, right?

136
00:07:45,154 --> 00:07:46,744
That is hyper personalization engine.

137
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,534
And the third one is
intelligent process automation.

138
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:55,139
So now we consider data, we
process it, and we have, we started

139
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:56,399
working on this process data.

140
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,880
We use this process data for
making better decisions tailored

141
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,950
approaches and process automation.

142
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:06,310
So you should see wherever there's a
refinement, there is a fine tune fine

143
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,110
tuning required for this process.

144
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:13,745
And based on this processed data you will
have a better control how intelligently

145
00:08:13,745 --> 00:08:15,635
you can automate some of these processes.

146
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,275
You can apply these cognitive
capabilities, but not,

147
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,114
re-engineering the whole system.

148
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:22,794
Yeah.

149
00:08:22,944 --> 00:08:27,984
So why I'm, in one thing I would say why
I am multiple times insisting on this.

150
00:08:27,984 --> 00:08:32,934
Sometimes we go with this rip and
replace as a whole cell approach.

151
00:08:33,194 --> 00:08:35,895
That might not be really
helping you sometimes.

152
00:08:35,984 --> 00:08:40,605
So that's when you have to think about
what if I use these AI powered solutions?

153
00:08:40,905 --> 00:08:44,565
On these retail systems and when
you try to impose this framework

154
00:08:44,845 --> 00:08:48,295
what it demonstrates actually what
kind of potential it'll give you

155
00:08:48,605 --> 00:08:51,605
in in, in the cases of increasing
the customer engagement rates.

156
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,040
And I would say based on this
survey, I would say like 40%.

157
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,010
I would say there is a, there
is an amount of increase in this

158
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:03,250
customer engagement and also in
the overall operation efficiency.

159
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,980
When you use this
cognitive retail approach.

160
00:09:07,885 --> 00:09:11,895
Okay, now we have seen what are the
layers various layers involved in

161
00:09:11,895 --> 00:09:13,605
this methodology in this framework.

162
00:09:13,605 --> 00:09:17,475
Now we will see what are the various
phases, how exactly we can implement

163
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:19,225
this cognitive retail framework.

164
00:09:19,765 --> 00:09:21,925
Phase one is like cognitive foundation.

165
00:09:22,385 --> 00:09:26,285
Phase two, intelligent augmentation and
phase three is autonomous optimization.

166
00:09:26,795 --> 00:09:30,165
So what exactly meant
by cognitive foundation.

167
00:09:30,615 --> 00:09:35,125
Now like I mentioned in the previous
slide, you have so much data, critical

168
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,805
data, siding on these platforms.

169
00:09:37,105 --> 00:09:41,725
You have to build efficient data
pipelines and even streams so that you

170
00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:46,015
can definitely build a core infrastructure
that, that, I would say that's the basic.

171
00:09:46,465 --> 00:09:49,545
The foundation phase where you
will you will establish this

172
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:51,405
co cognitive retail framework.

173
00:09:52,095 --> 00:09:54,525
And phase three is very
intelligent augmentation.

174
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:59,145
So now you put the foundation, now
you have to integrate these prediction

175
00:09:59,145 --> 00:10:03,345
capabilities into these operation
systems so that you can augment

176
00:10:03,345 --> 00:10:07,625
the capacity or the the efficiency
of these intelligent systems.

177
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,985
And the third phase is
autonomous optimization.

178
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:15,185
As the name series you, by
implementing phase one and phase

179
00:10:15,185 --> 00:10:16,985
two, you are always welcoming.

180
00:10:17,265 --> 00:10:23,415
These systems like to be self capable,
self-managed or self optimize these

181
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,665
algorithms and these closed loop systems.

182
00:10:25,945 --> 00:10:27,745
These three phases would really help.

183
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:32,140
Anyone to implement this cognitive
retail modernization framework.

184
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:36,385
That way we will see like a tremendous
difference between the traditional

185
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,875
approach and the the a powered approach.

186
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:44,335
And I would see definitely I have
to mention this, by using this

187
00:10:44,365 --> 00:10:49,805
approach, there is a success rate near
2.5 times higher for this approach

188
00:10:49,805 --> 00:10:53,420
where you'll still be falling that
incremental and the phased manner.

189
00:10:54,095 --> 00:10:54,695
Approach.

190
00:10:56,765 --> 00:10:57,035
Okay.

191
00:10:57,425 --> 00:10:57,695
Yeah.

192
00:10:57,745 --> 00:11:00,795
I, to make it in a better,
under better understanding, I

193
00:11:00,795 --> 00:11:02,145
would wanna take a case study.

194
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:06,785
It is about a regional grocery chain,
which which like, which, just like

195
00:11:06,785 --> 00:11:11,095
any other grocery chain would be
handling things like out of stock

196
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:13,425
issues over inventory, overstock.

197
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:17,950
Like in terms of how effective we
do the promotion strategies, and

198
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:22,130
once I implement this, what are the
responses how it is really affecting

199
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:26,880
the customer's shopping trends and how
I'm really, retaining those customers.

200
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,680
So I want to take this case today.

201
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,790
I want to talk about what if I implement
this AI powered approach, how exactly

202
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:37,030
is going to bring the benefits, sir?
So I want to call out certain numbers.

203
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,980
This particular grocery change,
which I'm talking about, it is like

204
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:45,190
having an old application, a legacy
application, which is of 15 years

205
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,500
old merchandising management system.

206
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:52,690
Now rather than doing this conventional
approach of rip and replace of the whole

207
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,490
wholesale approach what if I try to
deploy this cognitive retail modernization

208
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,760
approach, how exactly it is going to
bring the differences or the results.

209
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:06,415
So I would say based on the case study,
it has tremendously, it has showed

210
00:12:06,415 --> 00:12:10,135
the substantial business outcomes
with especially the positive return

211
00:12:10,135 --> 00:12:11,965
on investment within the eight months.

212
00:12:12,455 --> 00:12:16,475
I would say the total implementation
cost was like approximately $3.2

213
00:12:16,475 --> 00:12:20,855
million, representing around
0.4% of retail's annual revenue.

214
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:26,705
And it is compared to the estimated
12, $15 million, had it been like you

215
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,325
have used this conventional approach.

216
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,735
Now I have said that I have used this
AI powered approach instead of this

217
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:38,245
conventional approach, how exactly
it is going to impact the financial

218
00:12:38,245 --> 00:12:42,955
factors of this grocery chain,
first year financial be benefits.

219
00:12:43,105 --> 00:12:47,545
So it has proved that it is going to,
or it has already given approximately

220
00:12:47,545 --> 00:12:53,130
$5.8 million financial benefits
with 181% written on investment.

221
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,670
That is the first
obvious financial impact.

222
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,680
And the second thing,
inventory management.

223
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,660
So approximately $3.5 million you
can save or you can see the savings

224
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:09,520
through reducing the carrying costs
decreas shrinkage and improved sales

225
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,240
for enhanced product availability
and marketing effectiveness.

226
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,400
So under this category, it is
approximately like $1.2 million.

227
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,220
By enhancing this marketing
strategies promotional efficiency,

228
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,150
all, all because of introducing
these cognitive capabilities.

229
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:32,100
Instead of using this traditional approach
of modernizing this legacy systems and

230
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,870
with respect to operational efficiency,
this approximately $1.1 million savings.

231
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:42,370
Especially improving the delivered
financial benefits through reduced

232
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,390
labor requirements for administrative
tasks and improved workforce ization.

233
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,430
So not only these financial results if
I want to compare with this traditional

234
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,500
approach, it is, I would say it's a
true continuous learning and adaptation.

235
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,590
This cognitive framework has introduced an
accumulated data, analytical experiences,

236
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:06,690
along with its predictive accuracy and
business impact increased over time.

237
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,020
Okay.

238
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:13,370
So that, that, I would say the general not
general, the specific financial category.

239
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:18,280
What are the general benefits if I use
this cognitive retail moderation approach?

240
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,590
One is reduced implementation risk.

241
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:25,360
If you rightly remember I have called
out this as one of the risks when you use

242
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,500
this traditional approach saying so much
these are mission critical systems, and

243
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,790
so much business value or business rules
would've been implemented in the system.

244
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:37,450
It is so possible that you might
not carry it over when you use this

245
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:42,080
traditional approach, but considering
this AI powered cognitive retail

246
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,550
modernization approach, you would, it,
you would like reduce this implementation

247
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,680
risk and foster time to value.

248
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,490
Of course.

249
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,730
So it is so possible when you
use this conventional approach.

250
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:54,295
It'll take some time.

251
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:58,975
It'll take large amount of time, cons
compared to these augmented approach.

252
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:03,865
So that way when you use these AI
powered frameworks, it is so possible

253
00:15:03,865 --> 00:15:05,615
that you can start seeing the results.

254
00:15:05,645 --> 00:15:07,895
You can bring in the change
in a much faster way.

255
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:11,900
And you can start responding to
the market demands and needs and

256
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,370
lower investment requirements.

257
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,680
When you use this traditional
moderation approach, it is possible

258
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,450
that there is some amount of skill gap.

259
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,000
There is some amount
of efficiency problems.

260
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,830
There is a possibility that it'll we
tend to see some unexpected surprises.

261
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,270
If I use this AI powered modernization
framework it is definitely you have

262
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:34,340
a great chances of lowering your
investment or the capital investment

263
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,190
on these requirements and then
preserved institutional knowledge.

264
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:44,110
Like I kept saying in all these legacy
systems you have so much business

265
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:47,040
logic rules have been encapsulated.

266
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:47,740
You.

267
00:15:48,325 --> 00:15:49,225
At any cost.

268
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:52,375
I don't think business is at
the liberty of losing them.

269
00:15:52,765 --> 00:15:57,055
So by using this augmentation
methodology, I'm not going to move

270
00:15:57,055 --> 00:16:00,775
away from it completely, but still,
I'm going to modernize these systems

271
00:16:01,115 --> 00:16:04,385
res, be able to respond to the
business current business needs.

272
00:16:04,775 --> 00:16:08,315
So what I'm trying to say, you
are, I'm still able to retain

273
00:16:08,315 --> 00:16:11,985
the business knowledge what has
been there in those old systems.

274
00:16:11,985 --> 00:16:15,045
At the same time I'm able to
respond to the new business needs.

275
00:16:17,865 --> 00:16:22,725
Having said the bene the benefits and the
financial impact, what sort of challenges

276
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,565
we may face when you start implementing
this retail modernization approach?

277
00:16:27,075 --> 00:16:31,035
So data quality issues, like I said,
so data plays a very critical role.

278
00:16:31,385 --> 00:16:35,955
If the data is not being properly
maintained, not refined enough, so

279
00:16:35,955 --> 00:16:39,575
whatever the data you are going to
supply for this moderation approach,

280
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:43,565
it is possible that it may not give
you the expected outcome because the

281
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:46,855
data is not in a very refined format.

282
00:16:47,365 --> 00:16:50,065
It is possible that it'll
give you undesired outcomes

283
00:16:50,485 --> 00:16:52,195
and integration complexity.

284
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:56,435
You have to understand I'm trying
to modernize these legacy systems.

285
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:57,375
During this process.

286
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:01,155
It is possible that I may have to
face certain integration challenges

287
00:17:01,155 --> 00:17:05,495
and complexities when I'm trying to
bridge this gap with these a platforms.

288
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:09,255
So you have to be careful enough
and you have to consider ahead

289
00:17:09,255 --> 00:17:11,895
what sort of those challenges.

290
00:17:12,285 --> 00:17:15,195
That way it, it'll be easy
for us in the roadmap.

291
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,120
To make the process much
smoother and skillset evaluation.

292
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,170
So this AI powered approach, though,
we start seeing the results of it,

293
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:27,340
I would still say it is it is like a
quite a rapidly evolving technology.

294
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:32,680
So you have to be in a position to choose
the right set of skills and talent to

295
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,020
be able to apply their strengths and
weaknesses while I work on this moderation

296
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,570
approach on the change management.

297
00:17:40,295 --> 00:17:44,545
It's so you are doing, you're
doing a big leap from this legacy

298
00:17:44,545 --> 00:17:49,565
modernization legacy systems, modernizing
them to, a cognitive frameworks.

299
00:17:50,105 --> 00:17:52,925
It is going to definitely
be operational challenges.

300
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:57,145
You have to bring in certain change
management procedures for effectively

301
00:17:57,145 --> 00:17:59,575
handling all these operational procedures.

302
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:01,675
Okay, technical debt.

303
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:04,905
So not only these these four factors.

304
00:18:04,965 --> 00:18:07,975
The fifth factor is what it is
going to talk about having, we

305
00:18:07,975 --> 00:18:11,245
have already mentioned about this
increased integration complexities.

306
00:18:11,295 --> 00:18:16,125
The, these approaches are going
to accumulate this technical debt.

307
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:21,865
When it is implemented without appropriate
architecture, vision, and discipline.

308
00:18:22,465 --> 00:18:26,515
So these are the five challenges that
we may face when you, when we try to

309
00:18:26,515 --> 00:18:31,825
implement this framework modernizing
or enhancing these legacy systems.

310
00:18:33,565 --> 00:18:37,635
So having said, those are my
challenges that we may face.

311
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,910
What exactly the considerations
that you have to keep in mind

312
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,200
during its implementation.

313
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,440
You have to establish a
clear architecture standards.

314
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,010
Absolutely.

315
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:46,700
I agree with that.

316
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,265
So you should always have a a
standard way to design a coherent

317
00:18:51,265 --> 00:18:55,905
architectural framework that
ensures shortterm enhancements and

318
00:18:55,905 --> 00:19:00,225
supporting the long-term system
health and implement data governance.

319
00:19:00,795 --> 00:19:02,115
Who will not agree with me.

320
00:19:02,115 --> 00:19:06,310
Like when you are trying to deal
with such critical data, which is

321
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,640
going to be playing a key role for
your business expansion, you have

322
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,200
to have some governance in place.

323
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,340
You have to develop some master data,
go master management capabilities, and

324
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,340
you have to have certain frameworks
in place for maintaining the data

325
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,160
quality and develop talent strategy.

326
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:27,400
Like I said, it's a quite evolving and
rapidly changing technology platform.

327
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,720
So you have to have a strategy like how
exactly you can make use of the present

328
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,580
trends and techniques, and you can assess
the talent and the skills of the people.

329
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,330
And you can, put them in the right way.

330
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,270
So you should also see do you have an
internet expertise or you have to invest

331
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:48,190
so heavily so that you have to hire some
new people while you want to achieve this.

332
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:53,075
No the fourth one is
prioritize change management.

333
00:19:53,075 --> 00:19:56,555
So in the previous thing, we have
considered this also one of the,

334
00:19:57,005 --> 00:19:58,625
one of the challenges we may face.

335
00:19:58,925 --> 00:20:02,935
So you have to keep this as one of the
implementation consideration that you

336
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:06,825
have to have a comprehensive change
management process for effective

337
00:20:06,825 --> 00:20:08,870
utilization of these new capabilities.

338
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,980
So I would want to conclude, it is
all about like how we effectively

339
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:20,720
you balance like both legacy systems,
knowledge that is still playing

340
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,970
a pivotal role at the same time.

341
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,980
The new features, the new
enhancement that you can leverage

342
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,690
from this AI powered approach.

343
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,660
I would want to call out the three
various areas where you can balance it in

344
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,690
a very you can do it in a very balanced
way, enhance the customer experience.

345
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,000
So these cognitive capabilities.

346
00:20:39,345 --> 00:20:42,685
I'm pretty sure it will deliver
personalized interactions, that is gonna

347
00:20:42,685 --> 00:20:47,905
increase engagement rates by up to 40%
while preserving the human touch that

348
00:20:47,905 --> 00:20:50,095
defines exceptional retail experiences.

349
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:52,245
So that is one, one factor.

350
00:20:52,515 --> 00:20:55,155
The second one is preserved
technology investment.

351
00:20:55,565 --> 00:20:59,425
I would've already spent so
many so much money on retaining

352
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,405
this making so, so stable.

353
00:21:01,675 --> 00:21:06,565
My platform so much operational experience
and this refined algorithms that I

354
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,455
would've been having on my systems.

355
00:21:09,675 --> 00:21:14,005
You should you should go in a
very amicable way to protect these

356
00:21:14,035 --> 00:21:18,505
valuable institutional knowledge at
the same time you leveraging these

357
00:21:18,505 --> 00:21:20,080
advanced, the cognitive capabilities.

358
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,590
And compelling financial deals.

359
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,010
This would be the third area where
I would say you, you would be

360
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,860
able to still deliver substantial
operational improvements and

361
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,670
compelling financial returns with
significantly compressed timeframes.

362
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:33,570
Yep.

363
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,800
What I would want to finally
say is you have a legacy system.

364
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,570
With so much institutional allergy
knowledge residing on this platform,

365
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:46,390
you have to assess in a very thorough
manner, should I be placing what sort

366
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,100
of approach or strategy that I can use.

367
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:52,410
Should I be using a whole wholesale
approach of lift and shift or rip and

368
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:57,580
leap replace, these approaches are
proven ones, but still are in the a in

369
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:02,660
the age of AI and ml, you should really
take one step back and then see what

370
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,955
if I try to deploy these AI powered
approaches like what sorts of capabilities

371
00:22:06,955 --> 00:22:08,185
that it is going to introduce?

372
00:22:08,545 --> 00:22:12,085
Is it going to just modernize or
is it going to enhance further?

373
00:22:12,385 --> 00:22:14,995
So you should always have
such sort of decision making.

374
00:22:14,995 --> 00:22:18,245
And then see when I introduce
this kind of new frameworks.

375
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,160
Am I going to minimize the risk?

376
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,170
Am I going to maximize the value?

377
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:26,160
If that is the way, yes you, you have
all the possibilities of effectively

378
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,140
apply these trends in this digital age.

379
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:33,500
At the same time not losing this
institutional knowledge, which has been

380
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:38,510
proven for so many years and helpful,
being helpful for your businesses.

381
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,820
Yeah I'm done with my presentation.

382
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,610
Thank you so much.

383
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,690
If you have any questions, I would be.
