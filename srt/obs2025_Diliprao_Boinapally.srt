1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,680
Hi good morning everyone.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:07,560
I'm Gpro Oli from G two Solutions and it's
a pleasure to join you today at Con 42.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,710
Let's talk about something most
financial organizations fear,

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,540
but clearly rarely see coming.

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,969
Systemic risk, hiding in plain sight.

6
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:19,459
Our topic, observing the invisible
cloud native observability for

7
00:00:19,459 --> 00:00:21,439
real-time financial risk detection.

8
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:26,734
In the session, I'll walk you through
how we turn bankruptcy monitoring once

9
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:32,435
a slow reactive black box process into
a transparent cloud native pipeline

10
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:34,265
that delivers real-time insights.

11
00:00:34,265 --> 00:00:37,114
Measurable, ROI and
audit ready compliance.

12
00:00:37,614 --> 00:00:39,169
Risk reduction system architecture.

13
00:00:39,669 --> 00:00:42,809
We be, we began by reimagining
our entire architecture.

14
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:48,049
We ingest data from multiple sources,
legal filings, credit scores,

15
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:53,479
transactional databases, and third party
feeds, but raw ingestion isn't enough.

16
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:57,859
We built a serverless ingestion
layer using cloud native event

17
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:02,059
driven functions that normalize and
processes the data as it arrives.

18
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,989
From there, Apache Spark takes over.

19
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:09,849
It performs complex entity resolution,
matching data names, identifiers,

20
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:13,659
and even patterns across the data
sets to generate a risk scores.

21
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,669
Apache Airflow orchestrates
this entire pipeline managing

22
00:01:17,669 --> 00:01:19,769
dependencies and execution schedules.

23
00:01:20,269 --> 00:01:23,279
What sets the system apart
is embedded observability.

24
00:01:24,024 --> 00:01:28,584
Unified logging, distributed tracing,
and real-time metrics are foundational.

25
00:01:29,574 --> 00:01:35,364
We monitor not just for failures, but for
risk, signal quality, pipeline health,

26
00:01:35,364 --> 00:01:37,314
and regulatory thresholds in real time.

27
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:39,224
The visibility crisis.

28
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:44,194
Before this transformation, we faced
what I call a visibility crisis.

29
00:01:44,734 --> 00:01:47,404
Legacy systems were siloed and manual.

30
00:01:47,904 --> 00:01:49,554
When things broke, they did.

31
00:01:50,365 --> 00:01:51,865
We couldn't trace the root cause.

32
00:01:52,354 --> 00:01:55,474
Risk signals took hours
or days to surface.

33
00:01:55,974 --> 00:01:58,554
Compliance teams spent
weeks teaching together.

34
00:01:58,614 --> 00:02:00,384
Audit trail that were never met.

35
00:02:00,414 --> 00:02:05,894
We reconstructed, and every blind spot
was opportunity for financial loss.

36
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,499
We weren't just lacking the observability.

37
00:02:09,464 --> 00:02:11,444
We were operating in darkness.

38
00:02:11,944 --> 00:02:13,804
That crisis forced a mindset.

39
00:02:14,164 --> 00:02:15,424
Mindset shift.

40
00:02:15,694 --> 00:02:17,884
Observability couldn't be a bolt-on.

41
00:02:17,944 --> 00:02:18,784
It had to be built in

42
00:02:19,284 --> 00:02:20,969
our observability approach.

43
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:26,319
So we built observability in from
day one, full stack inability from

44
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,169
ingestion to orchestration to alerting.

45
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:34,439
Distributed tracing using open
telemetry to track every transaction

46
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:36,479
from entry point to risk score.

47
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:41,959
Internet logging, not just technical
data, but logs and raised with businesses.

48
00:02:42,649 --> 00:02:49,179
Context like case type, risk level, and
client integrated metrics like we tied

49
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:53,019
system KPIs like latency and throughput
to business outcomes like detection,

50
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:55,209
accuracy, and compliance Completeness.

51
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,709
This latest bridge engineering
and compliance, both now

52
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:00,209
speak a shared language,

53
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:02,809
observable serverless architecture.

54
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:06,999
Let's dig into architectural
observability layers, ingestion layer.

55
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:11,679
We capture quality metrics for
every document, format, issues

56
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:13,539
missing fields, delays in real time.

57
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:19,079
Follows part, workflows every
transformation is traced, enabling us

58
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:23,609
to monitor matching precision, detect
bottlenecks, and measure scoring contents,

59
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,209
airflow pipelines, each step logs,
validation status, error categories,

60
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:33,059
retry rates, and regulatory checkpoints.

61
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:38,030
This isn't just observability for
uptime, it's observability for trust.

62
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,380
Knowing the system works and.

63
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:41,614
Understanding why it works.

64
00:03:42,114 --> 00:03:44,685
Next comes our trans
transformation results.

65
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,015
Here is what we achieved.

66
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:51,804
We reduced average processing
time by 78, percentage from two

67
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:54,295
hours, 40 minutes to 31 minutes.

68
00:03:54,804 --> 00:04:00,609
Improved detection accuracy by 92%
risk alert now reach decision makers

69
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:03,049
in under 45 seconds and throughput.

70
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:07,150
Three 50% with 99.97 up 10.

71
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:14,530
These variant vanity metrics, each one
translate into less risk exposure, faster

72
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,900
interventions and lower compliance costs

73
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,110
with reduction through visibility.

74
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,960
One of our biggest wins.

75
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,500
Error reduction false
positive dropped by 87%.

76
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,100
False negatives, the most
dangerous ones fell by 94%.

77
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,790
Time orders and data mismatches
are now detected and resolved

78
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,470
in the early, early in the flow.

79
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,635
This has slashed wasted analyst hours
and prevented missed bankruptcies,

80
00:04:39,635 --> 00:04:43,675
both, which directly protect our
clients and reduce operational burden.

81
00:04:44,175 --> 00:04:48,135
Building observable components
we didn't get here by chance.

82
00:04:48,235 --> 00:04:53,575
We established a unified logging strategy,
structured log echo service services, and

83
00:04:53,575 --> 00:04:55,645
reached with client and risk metadata.

84
00:04:56,145 --> 00:04:58,755
We deployed end-to-end
tracing with open telemetry.

85
00:04:58,785 --> 00:05:01,725
Now every match and
transformation is traceable.

86
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:07,475
We implemented multidimensional metrics,
not just system health, but kps like

87
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:11,765
documentation, completeness and detection,
LA latency and match conference.

88
00:05:12,265 --> 00:05:14,995
Now engineering and
complex compliance teams.

89
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:18,480
Sharehold shared dashboards, share
alerts, solve problems together.

90
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,960
Here comes the compliance transformation.

91
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,690
Client compliance has
senior radical shift.

92
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,500
The documentation completeness is 97%.

93
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,740
Audit prep time down by 71%.

94
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,190
Evidence is 89% faster.

95
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,875
Audits that took weeks now take hours.

96
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,720
Every risk signal has stressful path.

97
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,590
Every regulatory inquiry has
structured reliable evidence behind it.

98
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,790
This level of visibility
doesn't just reduce risk.

99
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,540
It builds credibility with
regulators and stakeholders alike.

100
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,500
Dashboard design principles,
dashboards are more than just charts.

101
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,220
You know that, right?

102
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,695
Executives get KPIs and financial impact.

103
00:05:59,815 --> 00:06:03,755
Engineers get deep dives into
task failures and latencies.

104
00:06:04,055 --> 00:06:06,395
Compliance team get
traceability and alert blocks.

105
00:06:06,895 --> 00:06:08,785
We apply business context integration.

106
00:06:08,845 --> 00:06:12,435
Every technical metric is paired
with your business indicator, and

107
00:06:12,435 --> 00:06:16,905
we use historical correlation tools,
identifying patterns, emerging threats,

108
00:06:16,935 --> 00:06:18,465
and opportunities for prevention.

109
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:19,845
Before issues reoccur

110
00:06:20,345 --> 00:06:21,995
our implementation roadmap.

111
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,785
Our rollout followed a clear roadmap.

112
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:30,065
First, the telemetry gap assessment
mapping what was missing across

113
00:06:30,065 --> 00:06:31,625
tech and business layers.

114
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:36,675
Second instrumentation, adding,
logging, tracing, and metrics across

115
00:06:36,915 --> 00:06:39,305
serverless park and airflow dashboarding.

116
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:43,585
Designing role specific views
with stakeholder feedback.

117
00:06:44,455 --> 00:06:49,585
Next enablement training teams,
creating playbooks and embedding

118
00:06:49,615 --> 00:06:51,265
observability into our cultures.

119
00:06:51,835 --> 00:06:55,165
Each step delivered immediate
value while building toward fully

120
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,405
observable ret resilient pipeline.

121
00:06:57,905 --> 00:07:02,995
Key takeaways and looking ahead to wrap
up here are four principles we believe in.

122
00:07:03,495 --> 00:07:07,765
Designed for business context metrics
should matter to your mission.

123
00:07:08,265 --> 00:07:12,645
Built it in not on observability
should be part of your architecture.

124
00:07:13,545 --> 00:07:18,255
Enable end-to-end visibility across
all layers from ingestion to alert,

125
00:07:18,755 --> 00:07:23,704
quantify the value, so how it improves
risk detection and compliance speed.

126
00:07:24,395 --> 00:07:27,905
Looking ahead, we are exploring AI
augmented observability, using machine

127
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:31,804
learning to detect hidden risk signals
and optimize compliance at scale.

128
00:07:32,304 --> 00:07:33,354
Thank you for your time.

129
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:37,054
I'm happy to take your questions or
connect afterwards to discuss how

130
00:07:37,054 --> 00:07:42,664
observability can reshape your financial
risk systems just like it did two hours.

131
00:07:43,534 --> 00:07:44,434
Thank you so much.
