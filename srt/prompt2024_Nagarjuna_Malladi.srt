00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,879
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,400
I'm Nagarjuna Malladi.

3
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:08,350
And today we are exploring how Site
Reliability Engineering or SRE has became

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,520
a transformative force in enhancing
system reliability across industries.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:20,920
Developed by Google, SRE began as
a framework for balancing system

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,349
operations and software engineering.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,429
Aiming to maintain system
reliability and manage scalability.

8
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:35,030
Today, as nearly Every industry is
undergoing a digital transformation

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,090
from retail to healthcare.

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,960
SRE principles have moved beyond
tech companies to become critical for

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,620
managing reliability and efficiency in
sectors where even minor disruptions

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,190
can have substantial impacts.

13
00:00:52,885 --> 00:00:57,455
By undergoing these principles,
industries can improve both user

14
00:00:57,455 --> 00:01:00,975
satisfaction and operational resilience.

15
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:03,574
Let's go to our table of content.

16
00:01:04,074 --> 00:01:08,394
We'll review a little bit, introduction
of site reliability engineering.

17
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:13,559
And then, go through a couple of,
industries, e commerce, financial,

18
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:17,689
health industry, gaming industry,
and cross industry applications

19
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:22,769
like telecommunication, media, and
entertainment, and transportation.

20
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:26,569
And we go through key
performance metrics and industry

21
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:28,819
benchmarks, and then we conclude.

22
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,489
Let's go to introduction.

23
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:37,229
SRE stands for site reliability
engineering, and it's essential, the

24
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:40,919
application of software engineering
to infrastructure and operations.

25
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:46,009
Google pioneered this approach
to ensure it's complex systems

26
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,309
were available and scalable.

27
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:54,089
Today, as digital systems became
the backbone of multiple industries,

28
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:56,809
SRE helps to manage and optimize.

29
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:03,179
These infrastructures, for example,
in healthcare, reliability translates

30
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:05,859
to continuous access to patient data.

31
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:10,809
In e commerce, it ensures
websites stay fast and responsive

32
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:12,999
even under high traffic.

33
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:19,129
With SRE, industries can handle these
critical demands systematically.

34
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:22,549
Let's go to the core principles of SRE.

35
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:30,339
SRE's three main principles, or I
can tell pillars, are reliability,

36
00:02:30,529 --> 00:02:32,659
scalability, and security.

37
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:38,980
Each serving a distinct but overlapping
role in ensuring smooth operations.

38
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:43,769
Reliability is about system
uptime and availability.

39
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:48,819
Ensuring users can access
services without interruption.

40
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:50,129
Scalability.

41
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:56,149
On the other hand, means the system
can handle increased load seamlessly,

42
00:02:56,649 --> 00:03:02,669
which is essential during times like
Black Friday in retail or during the

43
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,079
trading peaks in finance security.

44
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:12,959
The third principle is crucial for data
production and compilers, particularly

45
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:17,709
in highly regulated industries like
healthcare and financial service.

46
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:24,109
Where a breach could mean not only loss
of trust, but also regulatory penalties.

47
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,499
Examples.

48
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:26,949
Reliability.

49
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:33,819
Redundant infrastructure in cloud systems
that automatically redirects traffic to

50
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:36,259
functioning servers during an outage.

51
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:42,349
Scalability, load balancers that
distribute traffic efficiently,

52
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,369
allowing systems to add or reduce
servers in response to demand.

53
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:52,729
Security, encrypted data
flows that protects sensitive

54
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:57,419
information from unauthorized
access and meet legal requirements.

55
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:01,409
Let's go to, let's analyze
a couple of industries.

56
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:08,589
In this presentation, I covered a
couple of industries, how SRE is used, e

57
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:14,449
commerce, financial service, healthcare,
gaming, telecommunications, media and

58
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,809
entertainment, and transportation.

59
00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:19,579
Each industry brings unique challenges.

60
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:23,479
E commerce is vulnerable
to sudden traffic spikes.

61
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:29,299
Healthcare needs absolute data privacy
and gaming demands ultra low latency.

62
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:34,999
At these industries share a common
need for reliable, secure, and

63
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:39,649
scalable systems that can handle
industry specific challenges.

64
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:47,299
Today's discussion will focus on And each
sector's distinct needs and explore how

65
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:50,689
SRE principles are tailored to meet them.

66
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:54,539
Let's see the unique
requirements by the industry.

67
00:04:55,039 --> 00:05:00,529
Each industry requirements are shaped
by the specific demands and expectations

68
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:03,319
of its users and regulatory environment.

69
00:05:03,619 --> 00:05:05,659
For example, in the e commerce.

70
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:07,379
Every millisecond counts.

71
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:14,479
And studies show that a one second delay
can reduce conversions by seven percent.

72
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:20,849
Financial services operate under
rigorous standards such as PCI DSS

73
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:26,669
for card transactions as need systems
with guaranteed uptime in healthcare

74
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:31,979
strict compiling standards like HIPAA
mandate security and logging and

75
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,709
downtime could endanger patient safety.

76
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,289
This is very critical.

77
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:43,869
Understanding these needs allows SRE
to adapt its principles effectively,

78
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:49,569
ensuring systems meet the unique
requirements of each industry.

79
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:54,839
All industries prioritize the reliability
and security of their digital operations,

80
00:05:54,969 --> 00:06:00,589
although implementation varies based on
specific needs and regulatory standards.

81
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:07,009
E commerce face two primary challenges,
maintaining the site performance under

82
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:13,459
high demand and reducing the cart
aboundment due to slow paged loads.

83
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:19,909
SRE solutions like auto scaling enable e
commerce platforms to automatically add

84
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:27,259
or remove resources as traffic fluctuates,
while CDN content delivery networks.

85
00:06:27,684 --> 00:06:32,184
speed up the content delivery by
bringing data closer to the users.

86
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:34,294
Improving the load times.

87
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:41,624
Kavos engineering is also increasingly
common by simulating potential failures.

88
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,234
It tests system resilience.

89
00:06:44,624 --> 00:06:49,424
Together, the solutions help e
commerce sites stay fast and reliable.

90
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:53,234
Increasing user engagement and revenue.

91
00:06:53,734 --> 00:06:55,024
Let's go to some examples.

Autoscaling.

93
00:06:57,014 --> 00:07:01,954
Automatically increasing server
resources during the flash sales.

94
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:03,334
CDNS.

95
00:07:04,134 --> 00:07:11,484
Enhances website speed by distributing
content and balancing traffic loads.

96
00:07:12,384 --> 00:07:15,864
As it's regional data centers
to speed up the side load

97
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,774
times for international users.

98
00:07:18,274 --> 00:07:24,114
Kavos engineering, testing what would
happen if a server fails during the peak

99
00:07:24,114 --> 00:07:29,644
shopping hours and impact, optimized
load times, reduced cot abatement

100
00:07:29,744 --> 00:07:33,664
and enhanced user experience lead
to increased revenue and obviously,

101
00:07:33,664 --> 00:07:35,074
it's a customer satisfaction.

102
00:07:35,574 --> 00:07:36,674
