1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,580
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,590
Welcome to the Con 42.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,350
It's g great to be here today.

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:08,700
I'm Balaji.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,059
I have 17 years of
experience in it industry.

6
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:17,110
I. A significant chunk of that
experience I have deeply, mainly

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,750
with Salesforce architect.

8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,830
My focus has always been on
creating solutions that are not

9
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:29,950
just functional today, but can also
adapt and scale as needs evolve.

10
00:00:30,775 --> 00:00:34,915
It's been a fascinating journey of
continuous learning and problem solving.

11
00:00:34,975 --> 00:00:36,745
It's fun to be a Salesforce architect.

12
00:00:37,295 --> 00:00:38,405
Welcome to the Talk.

13
00:00:38,525 --> 00:00:42,305
I'll be presenting low-code,
no-code Salesforce presentation.

14
00:00:42,605 --> 00:00:45,015
So let's get into the presentation.

15
00:00:45,565 --> 00:00:51,815
So Salesforce is stepping towards
low code and it might go towards

16
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:53,434
no code in the future as well.

17
00:00:53,495 --> 00:00:56,705
It is a small steps that's
it is taking right now.

18
00:00:57,245 --> 00:01:01,535
So what it does is it's, it is
revolutionizing the software development

19
00:01:01,535 --> 00:01:07,985
landscape by democratizing the creation
capabilities across organizations, right?

20
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:14,255
These innovative solutions enable
businesses to design, build, and deploy

21
00:01:14,315 --> 00:01:18,965
applications up to 10 times faster
than traditional development methods

22
00:01:20,015 --> 00:01:22,415
requiring minimal technical expertise.

23
00:01:22,725 --> 00:01:27,425
Whoever even doesn't have a Java
code knowledge or anything like

24
00:01:27,425 --> 00:01:31,895
that, still they would be able to do
the configurations and the changes.

25
00:01:32,015 --> 00:01:36,804
So that is where the low code and no code
is coming into picture in Salesforce.

26
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,555
They're revolutionary using this one.

27
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:43,925
By removing code barriers, they empower
domain expert and business users

28
00:01:43,925 --> 00:01:48,845
to directly participate in digital
transformation initiatives, accelerating

29
00:01:48,845 --> 00:01:52,725
innovation and reducing the IT blockages.

30
00:01:52,995 --> 00:01:58,795
So even business team would also be able
to do some kind of minimal changes without

31
00:01:58,795 --> 00:02:00,715
intervening with the technical folks.

32
00:02:00,805 --> 00:02:02,664
So that's how they're stepping towards.

33
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,960
So how that will impact
the business, right?

34
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:13,130
So there will be total valuation of 13.8
billion that we are looking at, and the

35
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,820
efficiency of development will be higher.

36
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:20,530
Like 70% of developer timelines
will be reduced, right?

37
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,700
And the maintenance efficiency,
lower ongoing support costs.

38
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,785
We will also get reduced.

39
00:02:26,785 --> 00:02:32,785
80% of the cost will also get reduced
because if there is no code that

40
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:37,105
needed or low code that is needed,
then it can be done by the business.

41
00:02:37,155 --> 00:02:41,025
Most of the cases, aura,
low level developer can also

42
00:02:41,025 --> 00:02:42,345
handle all those things.

43
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,730
So it'll also increase decrease
the infrastructure presence.

44
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,760
So that infrastructure
will be decreased by 40%.

45
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,430
That, so that is where the business
impact will come into the picture, and

46
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,060
then how they would be democratizing
the app developments, right?

47
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,010
So there are three key areas.

48
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,990
One is the business agility, rapidly
respond to market demands with

49
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,030
applications built 10 x faster.

50
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:14,325
Then the traditional methods, broader
development base enable domain

51
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:18,584
experts and business users to create
solutions without coding expertise.

52
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:24,795
Simplified development, replace complex
programming with intuitive drag and

53
00:03:24,795 --> 00:03:27,464
drop interface and visual workflows.

54
00:03:27,765 --> 00:03:32,954
So these everything will enable the
business team to go ahead and work

55
00:03:32,954 --> 00:03:37,524
on these requirements on their own
as flexible as possible to get there.

56
00:03:37,945 --> 00:03:40,705
Rapid development cycle reduction.

57
00:03:41,035 --> 00:03:44,905
So there is no need of a development
cycle as such as in when there is

58
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:47,965
a requirement, probably they can
go ahead, business can go ahead

59
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:49,495
and do their changes on their own.

60
00:03:49,915 --> 00:03:54,774
So the changes that we will be looking
at are more kind of a drag and drop,

61
00:03:55,075 --> 00:03:59,885
and then there is dynamic values that
are being changed on a high level.

62
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:03,815
So there is no in-depth
coding is dated as such.

63
00:04:04,355 --> 00:04:07,954
When we talk about coding right
now, apex Code is something

64
00:04:07,954 --> 00:04:09,095
that comes into the picture.

65
00:04:09,764 --> 00:04:15,085
Java can also be embedded into this
Apex code to write a complex code.

66
00:04:15,574 --> 00:04:19,774
Salesforce is taking steps towards
that and they are going to reduce the

67
00:04:19,774 --> 00:04:23,734
complexity of this coding by introducing
these drag and drop functionalities.

68
00:04:24,304 --> 00:04:26,494
So that's how the app development will be.

69
00:04:27,614 --> 00:04:29,864
Development time will be reduced a lot.

70
00:04:30,864 --> 00:04:32,484
User demographics, right?

71
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:38,964
So business professionals, 42% of platform
users, domain experts who leverage

72
00:04:38,964 --> 00:04:43,764
platforms to create business specific
applications without coding expertise.

73
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:49,374
IT developers, 38% of platform
users, technical specialists.

74
00:04:49,764 --> 00:04:53,334
Who use low-code platforms
to accelerate development and

75
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,864
reduce maintenance overhead.

76
00:04:55,974 --> 00:05:00,204
Other roles, 8% of the platform
users, including project managers,

77
00:05:00,564 --> 00:05:04,224
executives, and CI citizen
developers from various departments.

78
00:05:04,224 --> 00:05:09,029
I. And then analysis is 12% of
the platform users, data focused

79
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:13,259
professionals who create reporting
solutions and automated workflows.

80
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:18,869
So this is the demographics, how it'll be
taking part within the current partition

81
00:05:18,869 --> 00:05:21,604
of this, so let's go to the next slide.

82
00:05:21,814 --> 00:05:23,194
Cloud-based solution, right?

83
00:05:23,204 --> 00:05:28,484
So cloud deployments will be there, 68%
of low-code implementation, leverage

84
00:05:28,484 --> 00:05:33,914
cloud infrastructure in 2023, enabling
rapid deployment and global accessibility.

85
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:38,174
Radios infrastructure cost
significant decrease in capital

86
00:05:38,174 --> 00:05:42,434
expenditure as on premises hardware
requirements are minimized.

87
00:05:43,304 --> 00:05:49,034
Enhanced tech security, PLA framework,
enterprise grade protection with

88
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:54,404
automated complaints, controls and
continuous vulnerability management,

89
00:05:55,154 --> 00:06:00,549
dynamic scalability, seamless resource
adjustment based on demand, eliminating

90
00:06:00,869 --> 00:06:02,069
capacity planning challenges.

91
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:06,594
So that is how the cloud-based
solutions would look like once

92
00:06:06,594 --> 00:06:08,099
we have this low or no code.

93
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:12,459
And then what are the implementing
implementation challenges?

94
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:18,549
So the governance issues and security
concerns, scalability, limitations,

95
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:20,349
and integration complexity.

96
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:24,039
So these are the challenges
that are available right now.

97
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:29,469
So 67% of enterprises struggle with
establishing comprehensive oversight

98
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:34,149
and controlling proliferation of citizen
developed application across departments.

99
00:06:34,989 --> 00:06:36,099
Security concerns.

100
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:40,749
64% of organizations face
significant challenges in maintaining

101
00:06:40,749 --> 00:06:44,889
consistent security standards and
compliance protocol across their

102
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:46,479
low code application ecosystem.

103
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:52,389
Scalability limitations, enterprise
grade applications with complex business

104
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:56,709
logic and high volume data processing
requirements make share the technical

105
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:59,409
capabilities of certain local platforms.

106
00:07:00,744 --> 00:07:05,664
Establishing seamless connections
with legacy enterprise systems often

107
00:07:05,664 --> 00:07:10,164
requires specialized technical expertise
beyond the typical low-code skillset,

108
00:07:10,524 --> 00:07:12,624
creating implementation bottlenecks.

109
00:07:13,554 --> 00:07:16,644
So that is where the integration
complexity comes into the picture.

110
00:07:17,644 --> 00:07:19,954
So what is the approach
that we have to follow?

111
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:24,034
So comprehensive assessment
and strategic planning, right?

112
00:07:24,394 --> 00:07:27,994
Conduct through analysis of
organizational requirements, business

113
00:07:27,994 --> 00:07:33,304
objectives, and potential high value
implementation scenarios, and then

114
00:07:33,304 --> 00:07:35,074
platform evolution and selection.

115
00:07:35,884 --> 00:07:40,564
Identify and select platforms
that optimally balance technical

116
00:07:40,564 --> 00:07:45,664
capabilities, security requirements,
and user friendliness for your team.

117
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:48,799
Targeted pilot implementation.

118
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:55,249
Execute a focused proof of concept project
to validate benefits, identify challenges,

119
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,169
and build organizational momentum.

120
00:07:58,114 --> 00:08:03,714
Enterprise wide adoption and governance
systematically expand implementation

121
00:08:03,714 --> 00:08:08,094
across departments with robust
governance protocols to ensure

122
00:08:08,094 --> 00:08:11,064
security, consistency and quality.

123
00:08:11,484 --> 00:08:14,884
So this is how we have to take an
approach for this implementation,

124
00:08:15,884 --> 00:08:18,594
how the future investment
trends would look like.

125
00:08:19,364 --> 00:08:21,554
So once the ration.

126
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:27,959
Gets adapted to low-code, no-code
solutions, then they are going to see

127
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:34,839
a tremendous saving of economy or or
they are going to see a huge potential

128
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:39,770
growth where they would accelerate
the page of low-code, no-code.

129
00:08:39,859 --> 00:08:43,370
So 2021, it was 58%.

130
00:08:44,284 --> 00:08:50,285
Initial adapt adaption phase focused on
tactical departmental implementations

131
00:08:50,285 --> 00:08:52,175
and the proof of concept projects.

132
00:08:52,655 --> 00:08:58,324
2022 was 65% strategic expansion
across business units with

133
00:08:58,324 --> 00:09:03,030
increased ROI validation and
across functional applications.

134
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:08,805
Now 2023 73% widespread
enterprise adoption with mature

135
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:12,075
integration frameworks and
established governance models.

136
00:09:12,075 --> 00:09:18,645
2024 was projected as 82% anticipated
mainstream implementation becoming

137
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:23,025
standard practice across diverse
industries and market segments.

138
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,290
So how the business process
would get transformed?

139
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:33,180
Process identification, systematically
evaluate and prioritize business

140
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:38,220
workflows with highest automation
potential, and demonstrable rate.

141
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,550
Return on investment application design.

142
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,255
Harness powerful visual development
environments to create complex

143
00:09:46,255 --> 00:09:50,160
process automations without requiring
traditional programming expertise.

144
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,290
Rapid development.

145
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:57,885
Dramatically reduce implementation
cycles by up to 70%, enabling

146
00:09:57,885 --> 00:10:01,935
organizations to capture business
value significantly faster than

147
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,615
conventional development methods.

148
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:08,805
Performance analysis will help us
leverage comprehension analytics

149
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:13,755
dashboards to measure operational
improvements, identify optimization

150
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:18,944
opportunities, and continuously refine,
transform the business processes.

151
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,300
Security and governance framework.

152
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,670
Centralized oversight, security
protocols, development guidelines, right?

153
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:34,680
So establish a dedicated center of
excellence to strategically manage and

154
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,550
coordinate all the low code development
initiatives across the enterprise.

155
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,870
Comprehensive application, inventory
management, real-time usage,

156
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:47,970
analytics, and monitoring enforceable
quality assurance standards.

157
00:10:48,795 --> 00:10:52,935
Now coming back to the security
protocols, implement enterprise grade

158
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:58,035
security measures to protect sensitive
data and ensure regulatory compliance

159
00:10:58,185 --> 00:11:00,045
throughout the application life cycle.

160
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:04,335
Role-based access control
mechanism should be implemented.

161
00:11:04,335 --> 00:11:06,555
End-to-end data encryption protocols.

162
00:11:06,975 --> 00:11:09,765
Automated compliance verification
checks has to be there.

163
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,020
Development guidelines.

164
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,290
So these are the guidelines we
have to follow for the development.

165
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,610
Establish comprehensive policies,
empowering citizen developers

166
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,420
while maintaining our initial
standards and best practices.

167
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:28,230
Standardized design principles
and patterns has to be followed.

168
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,620
Structured testing and
validation procedures, mandatory

169
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,620
documentation and change management
requirements has to be followed.

170
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:40,400
So these are the frameworks that we have
to keep in mind when we are implementing

171
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,470
this low-code, no-code strategy.

172
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,410
So what will be the key takeaways?

173
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,900
So you have to evaluate your readiness,
conduct a comprehensive audit of your

174
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,760
current systems, team capabilities,
and the business processes to determine

175
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,640
integration, potential research platforms.

176
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,000
Evaluate low-code or no-code solutions
based on scalability, security features,

177
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:09,350
integration capabilities, and alignment
with your strategic objectives.

178
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,330
Start small.

179
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:16,189
Implement a strategy targeted
pilot project with clear success

180
00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:21,050
metrics to avoid, to validate
benefits, gain stakeholder buy-in

181
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:23,180
and identify potential challenges.

182
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,390
Build capabilities.

183
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:30,680
Develop a comprehensive training program
for citizen developers while establishing

184
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:36,650
robot robust governance protocol
to ensure security and compliance.

185
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,650
Alright, thank you so much for tuning in.

186
00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:40,534
Have a great day.

187
00:12:41,284 --> 00:12:41,644
Thank you all.
