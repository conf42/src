1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,760
Hello, comp 42.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,160
It's an absolute pleasure to be here.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,600
My name is Srin Ana, and I
lead engineering efforts in

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,550
Microsoft's finance organization.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:17,820
Today I'm excited to share a real world
transformation story, a journey where

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,550
legacy systems met modern technology.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,200
And where measurable business outcomes
were achieved by combining cloud and ai.

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,049
The problem we tackled wasn't unique.

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:35,830
Many enterprises face the same friction
with aging systems, disconnected data,

10
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,830
raising costs, and compliance complexity.

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:45,190
But how we solved with discipline,
collaboration, and right.

12
00:00:45,555 --> 00:00:50,535
Technical levers is what
I want you to walk today.

13
00:00:52,455 --> 00:00:57,075
We didn't just modernize, we
revolutionized financial systems,

14
00:00:57,555 --> 00:00:59,805
delivering results like 20%.

15
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:07,110
25% perhaps reduction in operational
costs, 40% improvement in data accuracy,

16
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,170
50% acceleration in delivery cycles.

17
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,179
And we did this while supporting
global financial operations that

18
00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:18,120
run on tight schedules and intense.

19
00:01:18,464 --> 00:01:20,835
Regulatory scrutiny.

20
00:01:21,074 --> 00:01:22,634
Let's get into that now.

21
00:01:23,175 --> 00:01:28,214
When we started, our systems were
stitched together with patches, outdated

22
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:30,914
architectures, and fragile integrations.

23
00:01:31,274 --> 00:01:35,475
We had decades old reporting
tools running on Reise servers.

24
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,840
Teams were constantly
firefighting, rather in awaiting.

25
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,110
The root of the issue was threefold.

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,450
Legacy systems, they lacked
modularity, had hard coded logic

27
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,000
and couldn't scale to new use cases.

28
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:58,700
Integration silos, multiple tools and data
warehouses were not talking to each other.

29
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,510
Finance team spent hours
reconciling numbers.

30
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,640
Scalability constraints.

31
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,440
Business needs grow fast.

32
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,840
Our systems couldn't
keep up with the pace.

33
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,450
The cost wasn't just technical.

34
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,400
It showed up in missed deadlines,
poor insights and anxiety.

35
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,160
During quarter closes, by spending
time reconciling the numbers from

36
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,090
one place to another, we knew
we had to rethink everything,

37
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,450
not just migrate, but reimagine.

38
00:02:30,395 --> 00:02:34,715
Our first step was to simplify
the environment through

39
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:36,455
platform consolidation.

40
00:02:36,845 --> 00:02:40,835
Think of this like cleaning
out a cluttered attic.

41
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:45,215
You find five different tools
doing similar things, disconnected

42
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:51,035
spreadsheets with conflicting formulas
and pipeline running on legacy jobs.

43
00:02:51,725 --> 00:02:54,395
We took a four step approach audit.

44
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:55,235
We.

45
00:02:56,555 --> 00:03:02,315
An inventory of every financial
application, reports and integration

46
00:03:02,705 --> 00:03:04,205
mapped to a business value.

47
00:03:04,265 --> 00:03:10,775
We identified the systems and underused
tools as well by leveraging telemetry.

48
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:11,900
Map.

49
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:17,150
We designed a unified architecture
with clear integration points,

50
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:21,950
reducing friction between upstream
and downstream systems, consolidate.

51
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:27,020
We eliminated redundant tools,
standard data pipelines, and

52
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:32,390
focused on reusable components by
consolidating the systems as well.

53
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,020
Validate this was the key.

54
00:03:37,535 --> 00:03:41,645
Every feature reported or rebuilt
was tested with performance,

55
00:03:41,675 --> 00:03:43,265
security, and compliance.

56
00:03:43,565 --> 00:03:47,525
For example, we had three
different separate systems

57
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:49,265
generating headcount reports.

58
00:03:49,265 --> 00:03:55,445
We merged them into one platform, reducing
the efforts by 60%, and ensuring everyone

59
00:03:55,445 --> 00:03:57,275
was working with the same numbers.

60
00:03:57,605 --> 00:04:03,245
This laid the groundwork for the
next phase, which is cloud migration.

61
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,460
Cloud is more than just an infrastructure.

62
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,590
It's about agility.

63
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:15,500
We leveraged Azure to build a resilient,
scalable financial data platform.

64
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,070
The results were tangible, 50% is faster.

65
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,825
Time to market forecasting
models that used to take months.

66
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,850
To deploy now go live in within
weeks 35% cost optimization.

67
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,750
We eliminated redundant storage, shut down
legacy VMs, virtual machines, and scaled

68
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,190
compute on demand, 99.9% availability.

69
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,790
This was critical.

70
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,140
Financial systems must be
always on, especially during

71
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,910
close and forecast cycles.

72
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:54,090
A quick anecdote, we had a year
and close deadline where reporting

73
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:59,100
environments used to take nearly 12
hours to prep After cloud migration, the

74
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,130
same setup was ready under 20 minutes.

75
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,970
That's the kind of a business
agility that drives the trust

76
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,190
and credibility across the teams.

77
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:17,705
The cloud gave us not just speed, but
reliability, security, and much more

78
00:05:17,835 --> 00:05:19,640
which is more resilience as well.

79
00:05:21,045 --> 00:05:26,535
With clean architecture and cloud
scale, we leaned into AI to bring

80
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,335
intelligence into our systems.

81
00:05:28,905 --> 00:05:33,285
This wasn't just about fancy
models, it was about solving real

82
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:35,325
pain points for finance users.

83
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,595
We focused on three care key areas.

84
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,135
Predictive analytics.

85
00:05:40,555 --> 00:05:45,385
We built forecasting models
with 85% accuracy using time

86
00:05:45,385 --> 00:05:47,455
series and historical signals.

87
00:05:47,755 --> 00:05:52,585
This helped finance leaders anticipate
OPEX trends, hiring spikes, and

88
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:58,555
vendor spending, automated processing
previously manual workflows.

89
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:03,285
Like invoice matching, report
scheduling, and cost reconciliation.

90
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:04,185
Were automated.

91
00:06:04,305 --> 00:06:09,675
We cut manual efforts by 75%.

92
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,370
Anomaly detection.

93
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:17,219
We used realtime AI models to flag,
duplicate payments, cost spikes,

94
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,590
and misla classified expenses.

95
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,789
30% better persistent
over rule-based checks.

96
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,219
This made our financial systems more
intelligent, responsive, and secure.

97
00:06:29,609 --> 00:06:34,815
Analysts could now focus on insights
instead of troubleshooting the data.

98
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:40,785
Let's talk about the hidden
superpower in our stack.

99
00:06:41,115 --> 00:06:41,925
Metadata.

100
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:47,775
Our platform is metadata driven,
meaning every dataset, transformation,

101
00:06:47,925 --> 00:06:52,995
and the business rule is described
and governed by the metadata.

102
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:57,555
This impacts in self-documenting systems.

103
00:06:57,585 --> 00:07:02,265
New team members ramp up faster and
maintenance becomes much more predictable.

104
00:07:02,685 --> 00:07:07,365
Dynamic data models, instead of
changing code, we change metadata.

105
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,855
That means faster adaptability.

106
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,680
To regulatory or business changes.

107
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,580
Governance metadata allows
full lineage tracking.

108
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:22,250
If someone changes a report logic,
we know exactly where it propagates.

109
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,610
We treated metadata not as an
afterthought, but as a design principle.

110
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,215
This paid off in compliance
audits, system reliability,

111
00:07:32,795 --> 00:07:34,815
and long-term maintainability.

112
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:43,635
Let's look at what all this deliver in
real business terms, report generation.

113
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:48,315
Improved from 24 hours to three hours.

114
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:52,005
Data errors reduced from 12% to 3%.

115
00:07:52,335 --> 00:07:55,965
Operational costs came down by 25%.

116
00:07:56,385 --> 00:08:00,585
Time to insights changed
from 48 hours to 12 hours.

117
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,750
These are just not metrics.

118
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,010
They reflect fewer escalations, more
confidence leadership decisions,

119
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:14,020
and an engineering team that's
respected, not firefighting.

120
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,159
We even heard from our CFS office
that our modernization platform

121
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:22,510
was now considered the source of
truth for executive dashboards.

122
00:08:22,809 --> 00:08:25,479
That's a huge order of
trust in engineering.

123
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:30,250
Technology is only one piece.

124
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:33,490
Success required execution discipline.

125
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:39,760
This comes with strategic planning,
every initiative tied to a business goal.

126
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:45,280
Agile development, sprints,
stakeholders, feedback with faster

127
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,439
iteration change management.

128
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,209
We trained users, provided shadowing,
and had hands-on labs as well.

129
00:08:52,975 --> 00:08:57,745
Continuous improvement Every
release had built in feedback loops.

130
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:04,285
We also built strong cross team
partnerships between finance, SMEs,

131
00:09:04,315 --> 00:09:09,835
subject matter expertise, data engineers,
security teams, and product managers.

132
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:11,755
No one worked in a vacuum.

133
00:09:12,145 --> 00:09:18,775
This was the key to not just delivering
transformation, but sustaining as well.

134
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:23,694
As I mentioned initially,
this has been a journey.

135
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:27,025
All journeys comes with learnings as well.

136
00:09:27,145 --> 00:09:29,844
Here are some of the biggest
lessons that we learned.

137
00:09:30,295 --> 00:09:33,925
Things we would do it again, and
some we would do it differently.

138
00:09:34,344 --> 00:09:36,145
Start small scale fast.

139
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:41,425
Don't boil the ocean, prove value
in one area, and then expand

140
00:09:41,994 --> 00:09:43,675
cross-functional alignment.

141
00:09:44,004 --> 00:09:47,214
Engineers alone can't
solve financial systems.

142
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:51,234
Ambit finance experts in the
development process as well to

143
00:09:51,234 --> 00:09:54,384
expedite it, prioritize data quality.

144
00:09:54,415 --> 00:09:59,634
You can have the best AI model in the
world, but garbage in and garbage out.

145
00:10:00,114 --> 00:10:05,160
These insights help us to build a
system that works not just today,

146
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,224
but in future Ready as well.

147
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:16,209
To wrap up, I would like to
say modernizing financial

148
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:18,699
systems is no longer optional.

149
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:20,499
It's a mission critical.

150
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:26,109
If you are facing similar challenges,
I encourage you to start with what's

151
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:29,109
broken and quantify the business plan.

152
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:37,100
Sometimes you would be surprised what kind
of damage the existing legacy systems can

153
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:44,030
do to your time, to your data quality, and
to the credibility of the systems as well.

154
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,770
Don't skip governance.

155
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,080
It's the foundational of trust.

156
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:53,210
Invest in the right levers,
cloud for scale, AI for insights,

157
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,330
metadata flow for flexibility.

158
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,189
This journey isn't easy.

159
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:03,859
But the rewards are enormous,
faster insights, trusted data

160
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,839
and operational excellence.

161
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,810
Thank you so much for joining me.

162
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,020
I'm happy to take any
questions or chat afterward.

163
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:16,849
Let's build the systems that work for
the business, not the other way around.

164
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,199
Thank you very much.
