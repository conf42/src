Here is what we will cover.

12
00:00:51,849 --> 00:00:53,110
Here is what we will cover.

13
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,200
The challenges enterprises face.

14
00:00:55,265 --> 00:00:59,845
The opportunity in the growing AI
cloud market, our innovative solutions,

15
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:04,864
their proven impact, and a glimpse
into the future of AI and cloud.

00:01:07,294 --> 00:01:10,834
moving forward to the challenges
in enterprise cloud operations.

18
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,644
What are the main pain points?

19
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:17,804
Despite the strides we have made,
enterprises still face significant

20
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:19,425
cloud related challenges.

21
00:01:19,764 --> 00:01:25,264
Some of those are excessive operational
costs, 45 percent overspending due

22
00:01:25,264 --> 00:01:30,424
to inefficient resource utilization
as well as manual optimizations.

23
00:01:30,505 --> 00:01:35,774
Resource management issues that leads
to 38 percent of average resource

24
00:01:35,774 --> 00:01:40,645
wastage, inconsistent workload
distribution, and poor capacity planning.

25
00:01:41,145 --> 00:01:42,425
Security vulnerabilities.

26
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:46,794
Over 12, 000 cloud security
incidents happens annually.

27
00:01:46,994 --> 00:01:48,474
Unfortunately, but that happens.

28
00:01:48,864 --> 00:01:51,015
With an average detection of 4.

29
00:01:51,015 --> 00:01:51,464
5 hours.

30
00:01:51,964 --> 00:01:53,804
And last but not the least.

31
00:01:54,524 --> 00:01:56,104
Limited predictive capabilities.

32
00:01:56,594 --> 00:02:03,204
37 hours of unplanned downtime monthly
due to reactive management approaches.

33
00:02:03,704 --> 00:02:05,834
So what are the real
world impact for this?

34
00:02:06,304 --> 00:02:11,304
Such challenges not only inflate
operational costs, but also hinder

35
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,114
scalability and compromise security.

36
00:02:14,714 --> 00:02:15,544
What is the result?

37
00:02:16,044 --> 00:02:17,134
The result is huge.

38
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:20,884
Missed opportunities for
innovation and growth.

39
00:02:21,384 --> 00:02:24,494
So how many of you have
experienced these challenges?

40
00:02:24,924 --> 00:02:28,784
These aren't just technical problems,
they are everyday business problems.

41
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:33,295
Now, going forward to the next slide,
that is growing market opportunity.

42
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:38,075
The AI cloud market is
projected to reach 236.

43
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:40,265
4 billion by 2027.

44
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:43,425
Growing at a compound annual rate of 42.

45
00:02:43,445 --> 00:02:44,295
8%.

46
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:45,375
That's huge.

47
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:50,134
Enterprises worldwide are increasing
their budgets for cloud AI integration,

48
00:02:50,475 --> 00:02:55,375
with 76 percent prioritizing this in
the digital transformation strategies.

49
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,285
So what is fueling this growth?

50
00:02:58,185 --> 00:02:59,595
There are a couple of factors for this.

51
00:02:59,855 --> 00:03:01,795
First is digital transformation.

52
00:03:02,445 --> 00:03:07,175
89 percent of enterprises now
prioritize cloud AI integration.

53
00:03:07,765 --> 00:03:11,715
Operational efficiency demands,
which leads to 67 percent are

54
00:03:11,785 --> 00:03:16,084
actively seeking automated
solutions to optimize operations.

55
00:03:16,584 --> 00:03:17,084
Competitive pressure.

56
00:03:17,685 --> 00:03:22,515
91 percent of industry leaders report a 3.

57
00:03:22,515 --> 00:03:25,254
5 percent competitive advantage
through AI cloud adoption.

58
00:03:25,754 --> 00:03:28,029
So what is the Action we have to take.

59
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:35,479
The question is no longer if, but how we
embrace this opportunity to stay ahead

60
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:38,189
in the race of digital transformation.

61
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:41,339
We have to move forward with an action.

62
00:03:41,369 --> 00:03:47,499
So what we propose here is our solution,
AI enhanced cloud architecture.

63
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:50,429
So in this model, we'll talk
about the core features.

64
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:54,609
how it works, and what are the
business values for the solution.

65
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:59,689
At Microsoft, we have developed an AI
enhanced cloud architecture that addresses

66
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:02,149
these challenges with many, parameters.

67
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,089
First is productive resource management.

68
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,319
With 91 percent accuracy, machine
learning analyzes historical patterns,

69
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,809
seasonal variations, and growth trends.

70
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:13,889
Intelligence security framework.

71
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:16,479
We believe in zero trust security.

72
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:17,439
Achieving 99.

73
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,429
7 percent threat detection accuracy.

74
00:04:20,499 --> 00:04:24,649
Our frameworks provide real time
monitoring, compliance check,

75
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,269
and zero trust architecture.

76
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:32,009
Dynamic scaling capabilities, automatic
workload, workload balancing, and

77
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:38,764
multi region optimization reduce Over
provisioning by 67 percent is that reduce

78
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:44,314
waste is resource wastage and enhance
the resource optimization and then multi

79
00:04:44,314 --> 00:04:49,474
cloud integration with the possibility
of seamlessly connecting platform with

80
00:04:49,514 --> 00:04:55,374
unified management interface, ensuring
that vendor agnostic deployment happens.

81
00:04:55,404 --> 00:05:00,544
And this helps in multi cloud
integration talking about their features.

82
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:01,854
But how does it actually works?

83
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:09,494
So we combine both, cloud, public cloud
services like, Azure, AWS, cloud, Google

84
00:05:09,494 --> 00:05:14,294
Cloud, with private cloud components
for sensitive data and edge computing.

85
00:05:14,794 --> 00:05:18,084
Optimizing performance
across 150 global locations.

86
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,989
So that's been a whole lot of business
values, and these business values

87
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:27,134
translate into tangible results of a 42
percent reduction in operational cost.

88
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:34,269
53 percent is increased process efficiency
and 89 percent pure security incidence.

89
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:38,759
So we will discuss this with
a real, world success stories.

90
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:42,119
So this is something which I have
talked about the business values.

91
00:05:42,619 --> 00:05:45,539
Let's move on to the real
world success stories.

92
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:49,829
I'm going to share with you a fortune
500 manufacturer case study with you.

93
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:55,879
So allow me to share a story about one
of our fortune 500 client, a global

94
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:00,519
manufacturing company struggling with
operational inefficiencies and high cost.

95
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,409
Here is what they achieved
with our solution.

96
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:05,369
Cost saving of 4.

97
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:08,169
2 million saved annually in maintenance.

98
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:08,534
2.

99
00:06:08,714 --> 00:06:13,674
1 million reduction in
emergency repairs and over 1.

100
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,264
3 million in inventory optimization.

101
00:06:16,764 --> 00:06:21,484
And talking about operational efficiency,
they see a huge improvement that

102
00:06:21,754 --> 00:06:26,894
costs around 52 percent of operational
improvement in resource allocation.

103
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:29,859
And 47 percent reduction in downtime.

104
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:37,009
Talking about their metrics, processing
850, 000 data points per minute, achieving

105
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:40,229
99 percent system uptime, and enabling 17.

106
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:44,559
4 additional production days annually.

107
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,039
So what are the key takeaways from this?

108
00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:53,309
This case, underscore, how AI cloud
integration is not just solving current

109
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:57,189
challenges, but creating scalable,
sustainable solutions for the future.

110
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:57,244
That's it.

111
00:06:57,744 --> 00:06:59,684
Now let's move on to the next slide.

112
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:02,284
We'll talk about, implementation.

113
00:07:02,664 --> 00:07:06,234
We have talked about implementation,
how we implement it, what are

114
00:07:06,234 --> 00:07:08,104
the competitive advantages.

115
00:07:08,604 --> 00:07:13,634
And let's talk about the future innovation
and how does the roadmap looks like.

116
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,154
More better view.

117
00:07:16,994 --> 00:07:17,964
Okay, this looks good.
