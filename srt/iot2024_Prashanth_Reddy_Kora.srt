1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,600
Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:06,610
it's an honor to be here today at
con 42 to discuss a crucial topic in

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,989
our ever evolving digital landscape.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,490
So it's exploring multi cloud
and hybrid cloud architectures

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,219
of effective data management.

6
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:18,249
So I'm Prashant Reddy.

7
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:21,090
And today I'll walk you through how these.

8
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:26,384
Cloud strategies are transforming,
data management and, enabling the

9
00:00:26,384 --> 00:00:32,235
organizations to meet modern challenges
in LLT and, broader tech ecosystems.

10
00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:38,205
So coming to the agenda, let me begin
my outlining what we'll cover today.

11
00:00:38,384 --> 00:00:44,205
So we will start with an introduction
to cloud architectures and explore

12
00:00:44,205 --> 00:00:46,854
the rapid growth of cloud adoption.

13
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:52,044
So next, I'll explain what multi
cloud and hybrid cloud models are.

14
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:57,504
So Are there unique benefits
and their challenges they pose?

15
00:00:57,804 --> 00:01:02,464
So we will then dive into, practicalities
of implementing these strategies.

16
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,110
successfully and wrap up, with
the key takeaways to position your

17
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,530
organizations, for the future.

18
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,450
So let's dive in right in.

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,330
So coming to the introduction
to cloud architectures.

20
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:23,349
So cloud computing has fundamentally
changed how organizations

21
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:25,139
approach IT infrastructure.

22
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:30,995
And data management, multi cloud and
a hybrid cloud architectures are at

23
00:01:30,995 --> 00:01:33,645
the forefront of this transformation.

24
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:39,655
Multi cloud involves using services
from multi cloud providers, offering

25
00:01:39,655 --> 00:01:43,575
the resilience and reducing the
dependency on a single vendor.

26
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:49,075
So on the other hand, hybrid, cloud
combines on prem, infrastructure

27
00:01:49,115 --> 00:01:53,615
with public and private cloud
resources to balance the flexibility.

28
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:00,250
And the control so together, these
models enable organizations to scale,

29
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,929
would say optimize the cost and
enhance data management capabilities

30
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:07,210
in the digital transformation era.

31
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,410
So coming to another slide,
the growth of cloud adoption.

32
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,940
So the cloud adoption is surging globally.

33
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,499
So according to Gartner by
2025, 95 percent of the.

34
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:27,325
new digital workloads will be
deployed on cloud, native platform.

35
00:02:27,345 --> 00:02:34,225
So additionally, IDC predicts the global
data sphere will expand to 175 zettabytes.

36
00:02:34,675 --> 00:02:35,914
So these figures.

37
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,710
illustrate the sheer volume of data
organizations which must manage.

38
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,800
So multi cloud and the hybrid cloud
strategies provide scalable, I would

39
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,180
say the cost effective solutions
to handle this exponential growth.

40
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,669
So while maintaining
performance and flexibility.

41
00:02:56,025 --> 00:03:03,564
So it's very clear why these architectures
are becoming essential in, in ID strategy.

42
00:03:04,014 --> 00:03:05,794
So what is a multi cloud?

43
00:03:05,864 --> 00:03:10,274
So multi cloud architecture
allows organizations to use

44
00:03:10,434 --> 00:03:14,749
multiple cloud providers
leveraging Each provider strength.

45
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:21,119
So the key benefits, which includes the
redundancy, vendor flexibility, cost

46
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:23,629
optimization, performance enhancement.

47
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:26,999
So performance enhancements
through the distributed workloads.

48
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:32,649
So however, managing multi cloud
environments can increase complexity,

49
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:38,369
introduce The security challenges
and require skilled professionals

50
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:39,979
for effective implementation.

51
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,389
So despite all these challenges, 75%, I
would say 76 percent of the organization

52
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:53,229
now use a multi clouds highlighting
the growing demand for this strategy.

53
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:58,959
So coming to the challenges, I would like
to discuss, of course, multi cloud isn't.

54
00:03:59,464 --> 00:04:00,504
Without its hurdles.

55
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:06,324
So complexity arises from
managing diverse environments.

56
00:04:06,824 --> 00:04:11,934
Security policies must remain
consistent and integrating data across

57
00:04:12,624 --> 00:04:15,584
different platforms can be daunting.

58
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:21,659
So additionally, organizations face
Skill gaps and cost management issues.

59
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:26,189
So overcoming these challenges
requires a careful planning.

60
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:30,129
I would say robust tools and a
team of a skilled professionals.

61
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:35,169
So in our next slide, we'll
see what is a hybrid cloud.

62
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:40,389
So the hybrid cloud combines
on prem systems with private

63
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:41,579
public cloud services.

64
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:46,099
So this kind of an approach
offers several advantages.

65
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:48,449
I would say data sovereignty.

66
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:53,199
So data sovereignty is nothing but
the sensitive data remains secure

67
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,529
on prem or in a private clouds.

68
00:04:57,909 --> 00:05:01,179
So I would say next advantage
would be the scalability.

69
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:07,719
So the public cloud resources can handle
the peak workloads and coming to another

70
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:10,159
advantage would be the legacy integration.

71
00:05:10,664 --> 00:05:14,434
So which allows the gradual
migration of legacy systems to

72
00:05:14,434 --> 00:05:16,914
the cloud and the cost efficiency.

73
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:22,954
So archives less access data in
the lower cost public storage

74
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:25,014
according to a Nutanix survey.

75
00:05:25,364 --> 00:05:31,214
So 87 percent of the IT decision
makers consider hybrid cloud

76
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:33,844
in their IT more IT model.

77
00:05:33,844 --> 00:05:37,254
So with adoption expected
to grow significantly.

78
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:42,964
So coming to our next slide, the hybrid
cloud benefits for data management.

79
00:05:43,244 --> 00:05:47,924
So hybrid cloud is particularly
beneficial of, data management.

80
00:05:48,224 --> 00:05:53,324
So it supports regularity
compliance by keeping sensitive

81
00:05:53,324 --> 00:05:58,414
data secure while offering the
scalability for dynamic workloads.

82
00:05:59,064 --> 00:06:03,594
And moreover, it enables gradual
migration of legacy systems.

83
00:06:04,054 --> 00:06:09,394
Ensuring, operational continuity and
reduces the storage cost by leveraging

84
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:12,014
cost effective public cloud solutions.

85
00:06:12,594 --> 00:06:18,754
So these advantages make hybrid a
cornerstone for the modern IT strategies.

86
00:06:19,299 --> 00:06:23,079
so we'll see how, the overcoming
of hybrid cloud challenges.

87
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:27,709
So however, hybrid cloud
adoption also has its challenges.

88
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:31,569
Integration between on prem
infrastructure and the cloud

89
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:33,709
services can be a very complex.

90
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:40,239
So ensuring all the security and
compliance across environments, which

91
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:42,249
will require the robust frameworks.

92
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:46,719
And the cost management depends
continuous monitoring like multi

93
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:51,949
cloud hybrid cloud success on the
skilled professionals and the right

94
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:54,159
tools to manage the diverse systems.

95
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:59,669
So I would say the best practices
for the multi cloud and the hybrid

96
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,459
cloud implement implementations.

97
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:07,689
to maximize the benefits of multicloud
and hybrid cloud strategies, our nation

98
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:13,069
should follow these key basic best
practices, like the data governance,

99
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:19,149
integration tools, cloud, agnostic
technologies, the continuous optimization.

100
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:24,859
So these will regularly monitor
the performance and cost to adapt

101
00:07:25,609 --> 00:07:27,599
to changing whatever the needs.

102
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:29,449
I would like to conclude.

103
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,669
So in a conclusion, so multi cloud
and hybrid cloud architectures are

104
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,539
pivotal for the modern data management.

105
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:42,619
So they offer unparalleled
flexibility, scalability and

106
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:48,489
cost efficiency, making them
indispensable for data transformation.

107
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,619
So while the challenges like the
integration and the security process.

108
00:07:53,304 --> 00:07:59,884
They can be addressed with best practices
and skilled teams as the multi cloud

109
00:07:59,894 --> 00:08:05,434
market grows to a project, projected, I
would say, 46 billion dollars by 2027.

110
00:08:05,934 --> 00:08:11,034
So these architectures will continue to
empower the organizations to thrive in an

111
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:14,344
increasingly complex, digital landscape.

112
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:16,964
yeah, so thank you for your attention.

113
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:21,364
I hope this session has provided a
valuable insights into leveraging

114
00:08:21,364 --> 00:08:25,924
the multi cloud and the hybrid cloud
strategies for effective data management.

115
00:08:26,454 --> 00:08:29,194
So I look forward for
your further discussions.

116
00:08:30,084 --> 00:08:30,544
Thank you.
