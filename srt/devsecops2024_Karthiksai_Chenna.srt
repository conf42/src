1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,010
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:01,980
Good morning.

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,089
My name is Karthik Swachhanna.

4
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,969
Today I'm excited to talk about
hyper automation in SAP production

5
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,520
planning in Con 42 DevSecOps 24.

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,629
I would like to just briefly give
a couple of details about me.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,020
So I'm a senior SAP delivery lead
with my interest leading to a

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,030
digitalization of supply chain process.

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,150
My focus is on changing the way
companies operate and utilize technology.

10
00:00:28,685 --> 00:00:30,685
So tomorrow's vision can
become today's reality.

11
00:00:31,555 --> 00:00:35,035
It's been a 15 year passion that
has taken me around the world and

12
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,325
continues to deliver results with
the most competitive markets.

13
00:00:39,094 --> 00:00:42,404
I have received Titan Business and
Innovation Award, Global Leadership and

14
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:46,324
Business Transformation Award, and I
have been judged in many conferences.

15
00:00:47,085 --> 00:00:50,644
Now going back to the topic of Hyper
Automation and SAP Production Planning,

16
00:00:51,014 --> 00:00:52,744
below are the table of contents.

17
00:00:53,564 --> 00:00:56,744
We'll go through the key
components, benefits, case study.

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,800
impact on production planning,
technologies powering hyperautomation,

19
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:06,890
challenges and ethical considerations,
the future of SAP, PP and hyperautomation.

20
00:01:07,679 --> 00:01:10,600
So going back into the
introduction of hyperautomation.

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,160
Hyperautomation is more than
just process automation.

22
00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:20,179
It integrates cutting edge technologies
like AI, machine learning ML, robotic

23
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:24,320
process automation, RPA and process
mining to create a fully automated

24
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,589
intelligent production planning system.

25
00:01:27,089 --> 00:01:29,419
Before diving into the
details, let us consider this.

26
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:34,759
Gartner predicts that the market for
hyper automation enabling software

27
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:37,250
will grow to 860 billion by 2025.

28
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,809
860 billion is too much.

29
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:42,610
Underscoring its transformation potential.

30
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,869
So how does hyper automation revolutionize
SAP production planning and what does

31
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:50,949
it mean for manufacturing operations?

32
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:56,860
So let us explore the key
components of Hyper automation.

33
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,340
So the key components are RPA,
AI, ML, and process mining.

34
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:05,810
Hyper automation integrates
several powerful tools.

35
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,600
Let break, let's break
down the key components.

36
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:10,179
Robotic process automation.

37
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,399
So RPA automates repetitive
rule based tasks such as data

38
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,720
entry and order processing.

39
00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:21,200
It not only accelerates process
by up to 70%, but also reduces

40
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:22,600
human error significantly.

41
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:25,870
We all are worried about human errors.

42
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:27,459
Artificial intelligence.

43
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,180
AI leverages production data
to provide predictive insights.

44
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:35,310
For example, AI can forecast demand
with up to 95 percent accuracy,

45
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,860
enabling better production alignment.

46
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,429
The next one is machine learning, ML.

47
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:45,220
ML models adapt dynamically to
changing production requirements.

48
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,720
These models optimize
production schedules, improving

49
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,690
efficiency by around 20%.

50
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,510
The next one is process mining.

51
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:57,189
This technology identifies
inefficiencies within the workflows.

52
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,899
For example, process mining has been
shown to reduce production cycle times

53
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:07,129
by up to 15 percent by pinpointing
bottlenecks and suggesting improvements.

54
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:11,019
So the next topic is what are
the benefits of hyper automation?

55
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:15,149
Now let us discuss the tangible
benefits, efficiency gains, accuracy

56
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:17,230
improvements, and real time insights.

57
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:24,320
So on efficiency gains by automating
manual process, hyper automation, Reduces

58
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:29,780
lead time by 25 to 40 percent and improves
resource utilization by 20 to 30%.

59
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,390
Accuracy improvements.

60
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,699
Forecasting becomes more precise
with accuracy improving by 15

61
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,769
to 40%, while inventory levels
can be reduced by up to 25%.

62
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,590
Forecasting is one of the key
components in manufacturing.

63
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,640
In any production facility, The demand is
always generated by doing a forecasting.

64
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,850
Salespeople will go about doing
forecasting and they will give the

65
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,899
demand to the manufacturing, leads
and the manufacturing leads will, pass

66
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:05,829
it on to the floor operatives where
they will try to meet the demand by

67
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,169
manufacturing the required product.

68
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:09,429
Real time insights.

69
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,829
IoT devices and advanced analytics
provide real time monitoring.

70
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,469
For instance, Downtime can be minimized
by 25 to 45 percent and detection and

71
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,609
response times are reduced by 50 percent.

72
00:04:22,369 --> 00:04:28,539
Ultimately, hyper automation drives
faster, more accurate and flexible

73
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:33,149
production planning, allows organizations
to adapt to shifting market demands.

74
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:34,959
So these are the benefits.

75
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,149
Now going into a high level case study.

76
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:43,069
So let's look at a case study to
see hyper automation in action.

77
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:47,229
A leading automotive manufacturer
faced challenges with a complex

78
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:51,509
production ecosystem by managing the
resources and on time deliveries.

79
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:57,799
Their solution included RPA to automate
scheduling and reduce manual workload,

80
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,239
AI for predictive maintenance which
achieved a 90 percent accuracy in

81
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:08,029
predicting equipment failures, ML to
optimize production schedules based

82
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:11,069
on historical data, process mining.

83
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:17,179
To identify workflow inefficiencies and
reduce unplanned downtime by 35 percent.

84
00:05:17,179 --> 00:05:22,029
The results a streamlined production
planning, enhanced resource management

85
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:24,669
and higher on time delivery rates.

86
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:32,059
This case demonstrates how hyper
automation can drive measurable impacts.

87
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:36,399
So going back to the impacts
on production planning.

88
00:05:36,859 --> 00:05:41,924
So on the efficiency side, automation
reduces lead times and Optimizes

89
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:46,464
production schedules, accuracy, AI and
ML enhances forecasting, reducing errors

90
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:48,214
and aligning production with the demand.

91
00:05:48,664 --> 00:05:53,484
As we already discussed, forecasting
is related to demand and insights will

92
00:05:53,504 --> 00:06:00,384
provide analytics on how to dynamically
adjust and do a predictive maintenance.

93
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:04,244
while we do, while, the production
planning, all while I'm on, the

94
00:06:04,244 --> 00:06:08,994
manufacturing, floor, I always see that
the plant maintenance guys used to,

95
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:10,654
do some maintenance in manufacturing.

96
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:15,229
The middle of the production line
stopping it So that they will stop the

97
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:19,209
entire manufacturing process and do
some maintenance and you know They will

98
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:24,089
take the test downtime and they will
discuss in their You know tpm regular

99
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:29,749
meetings on how can we do or How can
we manage our manufacturing even more

100
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:32,229
efficiently by reducing the downtime?

101
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:37,879
So these are some of the insights
that we can get by using the hyper

102
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:40,405
automation what are the key points?

103
00:06:40,645 --> 00:06:46,885
Equipment failure prediction, accuracy is
90%, unplanned downtime reduction is 35%.

104
00:06:47,385 --> 00:06:50,415
Now, technology is powering
hyperautomation as we say RPI.

105
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:52,124
it automates MRP runs.

106
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,065
MRP is one of the key component.

107
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:56,895
MRP is nothing but material
requirement planning.

108
00:06:56,925 --> 00:07:01,405
We will try to monitor how
much material is required to.

109
00:07:01,905 --> 00:07:06,265
Produce a finished good and how can
we plan so that we will not have stock

110
00:07:06,265 --> 00:07:13,614
deficiency during our manufacturing
or Producing a particular component

111
00:07:13,614 --> 00:07:16,014
or you know any end product, right?

112
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:20,785
So by using RPA it reduces manual data
handling by 70 percent and minimize

113
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:26,155
errors by 90 percent so AI It predicts
and enhances maintenance scheduling.

114
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:29,485
So we, there is always a maintenance,
usually every manufacturing

115
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:33,325
productions facilities will have
an eight hour or 12 hour shifts and

116
00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:36,835
they will have manufacturing, sorry,
maintenance down times, and they will

117
00:07:36,835 --> 00:07:38,455
schedule it and do some maintenance.

118
00:07:38,455 --> 00:07:41,585
They might apply oil or
tighten some screws or, some

119
00:07:41,585 --> 00:07:42,845
kinds of, maintenance, right?

120
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:47,510
By using the ai, we can predict what
can be the maintenance schedule.

121
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:53,420
And by using ML, we can do some adapt,
adaptive learning for better production

122
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,200
scheduling and anomaly detection.

123
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,679
There, there will be always some anomalies
like, if you are preparing a food or,

124
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,829
if you are trying to, make a car or, any
kind of manufacturing facility, there

125
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,950
will always be some kind of anomaly
that will be detected by using this ML.

126
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:13,330
We can do an adaptive learning and
learning on the way on the go so that

127
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,679
we can understand what these Assemblies
are by using process mining we can

128
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,090
identify process inefficiencies what
is causing process inefficiencies and

129
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,295
how can we use this process mining
for our continuous improvement.

130
00:08:28,135 --> 00:08:32,045
So statistics say that process
mining can reduce production

131
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:34,605
Cycle time by up to 15 percent.

132
00:08:35,105 --> 00:08:40,155
So coming to the challenges and ethical
considerations We always have challenges

133
00:08:40,165 --> 00:08:45,535
like any disruptive technology hyper
automation faces some challenges So

134
00:08:46,035 --> 00:08:49,950
when I always speak to the steering
committee or, when I speak with the

135
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:54,735
vice President of manufacturing or, CEO
of, any company who has a manufacturing

136
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:58,100
facility and who is the head of,
manufacturing, they always say that we

137
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,560
always have concerns about data privacy.

138
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,980
And, they always have
concerns about integration.

139
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,100
Why?

140
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,770
Because, on one side we are going
to use machines on one side.

141
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,790
We are going to use.

142
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,660
Software so software and hardware
combination in integrating both of

143
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,500
them is a very complex process as we
all know there is something called as

144
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:23,579
manufacturing Engineering systems or mes
where it can adopt or Integrate into any

145
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:27,969
kind of different software technologies
and make sure that the manufacturing is

146
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:32,539
going smooth without causing any kind of
issues So then that is One way where we

147
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:37,719
can see that there is an integrate, sorry,
integration with complex manufacturing

148
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:43,874
systems is always an big issue and
multiple challenges are faced at that end.

149
00:09:44,434 --> 00:09:47,464
And on the other hand, there is something
called something with data privacy,

150
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:53,404
always there is, data about customer or
a vendor or, some kind of financial data.

151
00:09:53,744 --> 00:09:54,834
so most of these executives, right?

152
00:09:54,835 --> 00:09:59,104
31 percent of them, are worried
about the sensitive production

153
00:09:59,144 --> 00:10:04,414
and customer data often involved
in, the, Manufacturing facilities.

154
00:10:05,174 --> 00:10:07,184
So these are a couple of the challenges.

155
00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:13,584
So now what is the future of SAP
PP and hyper automation looking

156
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:17,314
ahead hyper automation said to
become a corner store of industry 4.

157
00:10:17,354 --> 00:10:18,554
0 Which is the latest?

158
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:23,399
Advancement in AI and ML will unlock
new possibilities in production planning

159
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:28,039
from self optimizing systems to fully
autonomous manufacturing execution.

160
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:31,369
With a projected market growth of 18.

161
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:35,199
7 percent CAGR, as I said
before, initially reaching 26.

162
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:37,229
5 billion by 2026.

163
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,349
The adoption of hyper automation
technologies is not just a

164
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,229
trend, it is a necessity.

165
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:46,324
Even in our company when, where
I'm working, they are moving to

166
00:10:46,414 --> 00:10:50,974
Smart Factory where everything is,
controlled by iot, internet of Things.

167
