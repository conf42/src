1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,130
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:02,630
This is Na Krishna.

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,879
I'm a technical architect with
11 years of experience in AWS

4
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:09,444
Cloud DevOps, and automations.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,620
Today I'm gonna discuss about quantum
computing and its implementation on

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,669
AWS Cloud Quantum computing promises.

7
00:00:19,224 --> 00:00:22,584
To revolutionize how we
solve complex problems from

8
00:00:22,584 --> 00:00:24,864
cryptography to drug discovery.

9
00:00:25,314 --> 00:00:30,534
By harnessing the strange behavior of
quantum particles, quantum computers can

10
00:00:30,534 --> 00:00:35,004
perform certain calculations exponentially
faster than classical computers.

11
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:40,614
This presentation explores how a
WCS democratizing access to quantum

12
00:00:40,614 --> 00:00:45,855
technology and empowering mores to
explore the next computing frontier.

13
00:00:46,575 --> 00:00:46,785
Deep.

14
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:52,024
The topics covered in this presentation
are classical versus quantum computing.

15
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:56,675
Quantum computing applications,
hybrid quantum classical computing,

16
00:00:57,154 --> 00:01:02,325
quantum programming languages,
AWS quantum computing portfolio,

17
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:05,740
quantum hardware, and A-W-S-A-W.

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,720
Bracket architecture design
getting started with AWS

19
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,510
Quantum Computing access models.

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,640
And the final topic is future
of quantum computing, classical

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,870
versus quantum computing.

22
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:22,210
The current classical computers use
bits for calculations and computations.

23
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,860
The bits can maintain the state of
zero or one, whereas quantum computing

24
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:32,290
uses qubits where each qubit can
maintain state of zero, one or both.

25
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,215
To double the computation power of
a classical computer, we need to

26
00:01:36,215 --> 00:01:40,895
double the beats, whereas to double
the power of a quantum computer,

27
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,445
we just need to add one more qubit.

28
00:01:43,955 --> 00:01:45,755
That's the best thing
about quantum computing.

29
00:01:46,255 --> 00:01:47,845
Quantum compute applications.

30
00:01:48,055 --> 00:01:52,515
Where do we need quantum computing
in discovery, supply chain

31
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,555
and traffic flow improvements.

32
00:01:55,055 --> 00:01:59,495
Especially in financial modeling for
portfolio optimization and disc analysis.

33
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:06,265
This picture explains about hybrid
classical quantum algorithms where you

34
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:12,355
can see both classical computer and
a quantum hardware or simulator work

35
00:02:12,355 --> 00:02:15,980
together making it as a hybrid computing.

36
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,510
In hybrid computing, a classical computer
handles the most of the work by doing the

37
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,620
initial setup, pre-pro and final analysis.

38
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,210
And it controls a quantum
computer, like a co-pro.

39
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:34,975
And when it comes to quantum
computer, it tackles hard part it.

40
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:41,760
Quantum routines where the quantum effects
will help, like position and untanglement.

41
00:02:42,674 --> 00:02:45,135
And then these results would
be sent back to the classical

42
00:02:45,135 --> 00:02:47,295
computer for interpretation.

43
00:02:47,795 --> 00:02:52,655
This explains a hybrid model of
classical and quantum computing together.

44
00:02:53,155 --> 00:02:55,835
And let's discuss about
quantum programming languages.

45
00:02:56,435 --> 00:02:58,894
So we have mainly four
quantum programming languages.

46
00:02:59,744 --> 00:03:03,094
The first one is Python
with Kiki from IBM.

47
00:03:03,454 --> 00:03:09,464
Currently this is the most used quantum
SDK and Q Sharp from Microsoft and

48
00:03:09,674 --> 00:03:11,924
circ from Google's Python framework.

49
00:03:12,374 --> 00:03:15,974
And the final one would
be Amazon's bracket sdk.

50
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:18,769
This is the native to AWS bracket.

51
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:22,239
Let's discuss AWS Quantum
Computing portfolio.

52
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:26,769
AWS Quantum Portfolio comes
with main three aspects.

53
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:30,539
Amazon sub bracket, a WS
Center for Quantum Computing,

54
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:33,569
Amazon Quantum Solutions Lab.

55
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:35,989
Let's talk about AWS bracket.

56
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:39,589
It's a fully managed
quantum computing survey.

57
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:46,084
That lets design, test, and run
quantum algorithms on different types

58
00:03:46,084 --> 00:03:48,574
of quantum hardwares and simulators.

59
00:03:49,074 --> 00:03:50,694
AWS Center for Quantum Computing.

60
00:03:50,754 --> 00:03:55,075
It is a research partnership
with Caltech to advance quantum

61
00:03:55,105 --> 00:03:57,809
hardwares and algorithms under a w.

62
00:03:58,309 --> 00:04:03,170
Quantum solutions and they help
various orations to solve the

63
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,119
quantum computing challenges.

64
00:04:05,619 --> 00:04:10,269
Let's talk about various quantum hardwares
available on a WS for quantum computing.

65
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,749
The first one would be
superconducting qubits.

66
00:04:14,249 --> 00:04:18,510
These are among the most mature
quantum technologies, and these

67
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,580
are provided by IQM and rete.

68
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:26,390
The second type of hardware is ion
trap quantum computers, and these

69
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:31,300
have been offered by Ion Q, and the
third one is neutral atom processors.

70
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,960
These use areas of neutral atoms that
are mandated by lasers, and this hardware

71
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:46,270
is provided by two ERA computing and AWS
also provides quantum simulators where

72
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,220
alterations can test their algorithms.

73
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,700
The simulators before actually
actually getting started on the real

74
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:59,419
quantum hardware so that they can do a
pre-analysis and analyze the results.

75
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,990
AWS Oxford Innovation, this is the latest
innovation being announced by AWS in

76
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,610
February, 2025, where this chip uses cat.

77
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:17,280
Where the qubit stays on superposition
of two states, like zero and one at the

78
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,730
same time, while being more resistant
to errors than the regular qubits, so

79
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,670
it reduces the error corrections by 90%.

80
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:31,130
This innovation helps the
development of smaller and more

81
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:35,849
reliable quantum computers like
our regular personal computers.

82
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:40,340
The Amazon user was
launched in December 19.

83
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:45,969
Now it's generally available and it
is a unified platform for multiple

84
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:50,830
quantum hardware types where our
missions can explore various quantum

85
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,950
hardware types as per the requirement.

86
00:05:53,549 --> 00:05:58,559
And it is a pay as you go service
model where we, where our nations

87
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:04,229
need not to invest upfront, but
they can get started with the

88
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:06,809
service and they pay as they use it.

89
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:08,780
It democratized access.

90
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:13,969
It enables innovation for researchers
and businesses by simply using

91
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,330
a Ws in a simple and fast way.

92
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,539
How Amazon bracket works.

93
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:25,400
First, we create algorithms with Python,
SDK, and then we submit quantum tasks

94
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:33,389
to devices or simulators, then run the
hardware and classical computers like

95
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,299
we run hybrid quantum jobs on quantum
hardware and classical computers.

96
00:06:38,885 --> 00:06:43,745
And then we compare the results,
and then we switch between hardware

97
00:06:44,135 --> 00:06:48,825
with minor code changes based
upon how our results came up.

98
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,945
And this is the Amazon bracket
architecture diagram here.

99
00:06:53,555 --> 00:06:57,450
On the side there are three ways we
can interact with manage notebooks.

100
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,140
D, Amazon Bracket Console.

101
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:04,580
These are the three ways where we
can interact with Amazon's bracket.

102
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:10,130
In this picture, in the middle, you can
see Amazon bracket, so it has managed

103
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,440
simulators that have been provided
by a s and in the backend you'll see

104
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,890
different types of hardwares, as we
discussed in the previous slides.

105
00:07:18,415 --> 00:07:20,845
Hardware's approved by various vendors.

106
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:26,725
So based upon our requirement, we can
choose which hardware is suitable for us,

107
00:07:27,475 --> 00:07:32,755
and AWS bracket can seamlessly interact
with other AWS services like Amazon

108
00:07:32,755 --> 00:07:40,416
CloudWatch for notifications, Amazon S3
for storage of objects or data, and a s

109
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,466
management for permissions for management.

110
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:46,036
AWS key management for data production.

111
00:07:46,536 --> 00:07:51,245
In this slide, it explains about
how the quantum computers will

112
00:07:51,245 --> 00:07:54,235
process the operations, okay.

113
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:55,335
On a quantum computer.

114
00:07:55,545 --> 00:07:57,990
So the smallest execution
is called a shop.

115
00:07:58,455 --> 00:08:02,416
A single execution of quantum
operation on a device is called shot.

116
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:05,355
This one the first one
explains how a shot works.

117
00:08:05,925 --> 00:08:07,816
So basically we call it as a circuit.

118
00:08:08,316 --> 00:08:08,525
Okay.

119
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:12,656
If we have more than 10 shots, okay.

120
00:08:12,656 --> 00:08:15,566
So we can combine it as
a task and submit it to.

121
00:08:16,285 --> 00:08:17,185
Quantum computer.

122
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:21,655
So a series, it's, it executes a
series of shorts in a single task.

123
00:08:22,155 --> 00:08:27,626
And the third option would be like hybrid
job, what we saw in the previous slides.

124
00:08:27,865 --> 00:08:31,496
So basically a classical computer
and quantum computer work together

125
00:08:31,496 --> 00:08:33,415
to make it as a hybrid job.

126
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:41,235
This hardware can be used on cloud on
AWS as a pay as you go model, or the

127
00:08:41,235 --> 00:08:45,705
hardware can be set up on premises,
which would be incurring a cost.

128
00:08:46,455 --> 00:08:50,261
We can use combination of both
cloud and local resources.

129
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:53,701
And this is how we can get
started with Amazon bracket.

130
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:58,351
In database console, we can search with
Amazon bracket or simply type bracket.

131
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:03,151
It brings us to a bracket console
where on the left side we can see

132
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:07,861
devices, notebooks, jobs, tasks.

133
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,731
On the part we can see
different hardware that.

134
00:09:12,231 --> 00:09:17,271
So based upon the requirement, so we
can choose our specific hardware, what

135
00:09:17,271 --> 00:09:23,440
we wanna use for our operations and the
notebooks, we can rate our algorithm here

136
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,790
and submit it to the quantum computer

137
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:27,511
and.

138
00:09:28,011 --> 00:09:29,451
Final slide of the presentation.

139
00:09:30,021 --> 00:09:35,361
So as we have seen that quantum computing
can help us to resolve more complex

140
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:41,100
problems, the current research is going
on so that in the future we can have

141
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,960
fault tolerance systems where we'll have
less errors in the quantum computing

142
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:50,810
analysis, and they can be used for
the regular commercial applications.

143
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,830
And then we can use it for cryptography.

144
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:59,950
And also we should be seeing more quantum
education coming up, like workforce

145
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,570
development for quantum economy.

146
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,760
At the end, we want to see a quantum
computer as small as like our

147
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,810
personal computer with economically
affordable and less and feasible

148
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,480
for all computing applications.

149
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,490
Very much.
