00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,830
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,700
Welcome to CON 42 Python 2025 conference.

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,760
I am Sandeep Bachu and I bring over a
decade of experience in building and

4
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:12,199
securing cloud and hybrid platforms.

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,050
Today, I will be discussing about
securing cloud infrastructure in an

6
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:19,829
era of rapid digital transformation.

7
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:24,339
Let's talk about the growing
importance of cloud security.

8
00:00:24,889 --> 00:00:29,759
as the cloud adoption has
revolutionized business, it has also

9
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:32,389
introduced a broader attack surface.

10
00:00:32,889 --> 00:00:35,109
What kind of challenges do we see?

11
00:00:35,749 --> 00:00:41,229
Increasing attack sophistication and
lack of traditional parameter controls.

12
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:47,149
If we are talking about the statistics,
94 percent of the enterprise rely on cloud

13
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:54,154
services, but average into Enterprise
face thousands of cyberattacks daily.

14
00:00:54,684 --> 00:01:02,664
And also, by 2025, 75 percent of the
enterprise generated data will be created

15
00:01:02,684 --> 00:01:08,964
and processed in cloud environment, making
them prime targets for the attackers.

16
00:01:09,304 --> 00:01:14,974
how we can resolve this issue
is by Looking at the Zero Trust

17
00:01:15,014 --> 00:01:17,194
architecture, why Zero Trust?

18
00:01:17,284 --> 00:01:22,874
the traditional security models assumes
once users are inside the network

19
00:01:23,144 --> 00:01:25,734
parameter, they are trustworthy.

20
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:35,144
But Zero Trust challenges this by assuming
no user or device is trusted by default.

21
00:01:35,864 --> 00:01:41,714
And the core principles it follows
is continuous user verification.

22
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:48,979
It also goes by leveraging the least
privileged access, where users get

23
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,509
access only to what exactly they need.

24
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:54,529
It could be the applications as well.

25
00:01:55,149 --> 00:02:01,019
And also the micro segmentation to limit
the lateral movement within the network.

26
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:07,349
And now, coming to the identity and access
management, how we can leverage this.

27
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:12,589
the, there are certain IAM features,
which are nothing but leveraging the

28
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:18,549
role based access control, RPAC, where
we assign roles based on responsibilities

29
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:26,779
and ensuring employees or applications
access only relevant resources.

30
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:31,629
And also we can leverage the
adaptive authentication, which is

31
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:38,199
nothing but dynamically, it assists
the risk factors like the device

32
00:02:38,369 --> 00:02:40,639
location and also the behavior.

33
00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:46,409
We can also leverage the policy
enforcement, which is nothing but,

34
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:49,089
enforcing the access restrictions.

35
00:02:49,454 --> 00:02:55,984
for compliance purpose and also take
and also leveraging the multi factor

36
00:02:55,985 --> 00:03:02,454
authentication which reduces the
unauthorized access with, because it

37
00:03:02,604 --> 00:03:08,544
requires multiple verification methods
like passwords, biometrics and OTPs.

38
00:03:09,134 --> 00:03:17,084
Now, how we can leverage AI and ML
and threat detection in securing our

39
00:03:17,084 --> 00:03:19,474
cloud infrastructure applications.

40
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:27,164
So the challenges in the traditional
methods are slow and also prone to errors.

41
00:03:27,794 --> 00:03:33,844
As we scale, it becomes more
and more complex, which results

42
00:03:33,884 --> 00:03:35,604
in large scale breaches.

43
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:41,684
If we leverage an AI or machine
learning capabilities, we can

44
00:03:41,684 --> 00:03:43,724
leverage the behavior analytics.

45
00:03:44,244 --> 00:03:50,424
Where we learn about the typical user or
application patterns to detect anomalies.

46
00:03:50,884 --> 00:03:55,304
And also we can leverage the threat
intelligence where like the machine

47
00:03:55,304 --> 00:04:02,204
learning models, which analyze millions of
attack patterns for predictive detection.

48
00:04:02,704 --> 00:04:08,344
And also we can leverage the, some of the
emerging technologies in cloud security.

49
00:04:08,724 --> 00:04:10,494
We can also look at.

50
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:16,119
Quantum resistant encryption and
blockchain, the quantum resistant

51
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:22,259
encryption which addresses the future
vulnerabilities where quantum computers

52
00:04:22,309 --> 00:04:24,359
could break current encryption.

53
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:31,260
So preparing organization for long
term security needs, is, which helps

54
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,200
in the transition once, the quantum
resistant encryption grows along.

55
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,930
So now, if we are talking about
the blockchain in security, we

56
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:49,390
need to ensure that data integrity,
with immutable audit trails.

57
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:56,170
So we know if there are any audit
trails which are tampered, can easily

58
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,150
be detected because that's what the
blockchain helps us, It ensures the

59
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:05,225
audit trails are immutable unlike the
traditional approach where You have the

60
00:05:05,255 --> 00:05:08,855
ability to, to alter the audit trails.

61
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:14,135
now we can also use the decentralized
verification, which reduces the

62
00:05:14,135 --> 00:05:16,535
risk of single point of failure.

63
00:05:17,105 --> 00:05:21,415
And also most of the companies
are exploring and implementing

64
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:24,655
blockchain for cybersecurity reasons.

65
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:31,195
And also, we can leverage the
micro segmentation, which helps

66
00:05:31,195 --> 00:05:33,095
in reducing the attack surface.

67
00:05:33,515 --> 00:05:39,675
micro segmentation is more like
isolation, isolating or dividing the

68
00:05:39,685 --> 00:05:45,875
network into the isolated segments,
where each has its own security controls.

69
00:05:46,705 --> 00:05:54,010
The benefits is like, It limits the
damage of the attackers, what they

70
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,140
can do if they breach one segment.

71
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,900
It reduces the overall attack surface.

72
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:08,140
And also, the implementation can be
done by leveraging the software defined

73
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:13,870
network policies, which can adjust
the security rules, and also we can

74
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,720
leverage the VLAN controls as well.

75
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,840
which helps in this micro segmentation.

76
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,780
Now, if you are coming to the
serverless security models, how we

77
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:32,480
can embrace the serverless security
models for faster incident response.

78
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,260
why serverless?

79
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,180
this is one of the, most
asked question, I would say.

80
00:06:38,805 --> 00:06:45,275
Because serverless platforms, it's,
it is most, it is like an abstract

81
00:06:45,285 --> 00:06:51,025
infrastructure management, which enables
like built in scalability and streamlines

82
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:57,985
security monitoring, which means, so
it has an, advantage over speed, where.

83
00:06:58,405 --> 00:07:02,755
Incident response times can be
reduced by 65 percent due to the

84
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:07,645
automation that we can integrate
into the serverless security models.

85
00:07:08,015 --> 00:07:13,895
And also, it's a, it's cost efficient
because all these applications

86
00:07:14,395 --> 00:07:19,705
doesn't need to run on the physical
servers and also the scalability.

87
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:24,205
So these applications dynamically
adjust to the workloads while

88
00:07:24,205 --> 00:07:25,665
maintaining the security.

89
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:30,925
And also, we can leverage the
continuous compliance automation,

90
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:35,795
where we would like to streamline
our compliance with the automation.

91
00:07:36,445 --> 00:07:43,095
it eliminates the challenges that we see
today with manual compliance, where we

92
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:48,685
have to perform, time intensive audits,
and also increase chances of human

93
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:51,805
errors when doing the manual efforts.

94
00:07:52,475 --> 00:07:59,585
So if we can build the, if we can build
the automation, then we would see a

95
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:06,095
lot of benefits like, 80 percent rate
reduction in audit preparation times

96
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:14,835
and also the organizations save huge
amount annually in compliance costs.

97
00:08:15,075 --> 00:08:16,635
It also helps with.

98
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:24,935
Continuous monitoring, so we can
ensure regulations like GDPRs, CCPA,

99
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:29,565
HIPAA, and all are consistently
met for the organizations.

100
00:08:30,415 --> 00:08:37,785
And, while we discuss about different
models for this, it can be the cloud

101
00:08:38,195 --> 00:08:44,785
application or it could be the user,
how we can secure them, it's because as

102
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:51,125
enterprises increasingly rely on cloud
environments to store, process and manage

103
00:08:51,135 --> 00:08:57,875
all this critical data, the traditional
security, can no longer keep up with the

104
00:08:57,885 --> 00:09:04,415
speed, with the pace, how these evolving
threats are happening, the modern security

105
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:10,585
Strategies which offer a proactive
approach which helps in safeguarding all

106
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:17,235
these sensitive assets and mitigating the
risk also by adopting one of the core zero

107
00:09:17,295 --> 00:09:23,995
trust principles where organizations can
shift from all this outdated perimeter

108
00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:30,975
based models to dynamic approach, which
goes by like trust nothing and also

109
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:37,290
It enforces all this rigorous access
control and also continuous monitoring.

110
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:45,420
And also, if, since we spoke about
the IAM and MFA, if we are integrating

111
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,310
some of these advanced identity
access management and multi factor

112
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:57,390
authentication solutions, this ensures
that, unauthorized access is nearly

113
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:03,600
eliminated and also It helps in reducing
the vulnerabilities that account for

114
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:07,160
significant portion of all these breaches.

115
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:13,140
we can also leverage some of the AI
and machine learning, threat detections

116
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:19,680
that we have discussed, which helps with
speed and accuracy of, identifying all

117
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,980
these various, malicious activities.

118
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:30,350
And also giving organization the
tools to stay ahead of the attackers.

119
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,950
And also furthermore, when we discuss
about the quantum resistant encryption

120
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:41,100
and blockchain technologies, we are
paving way for future proof security

121
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:49,300
while, some serverless models helps
with reducing the attack surface and

122
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,485
also implement the response times.

123
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:56,325
thank you all for attending
this presentation.
