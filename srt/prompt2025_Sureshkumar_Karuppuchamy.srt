00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,470
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:07,200
It's a pleasure to be here to talk about
a topic that I'm very excited about,

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,710
prompt engineering for e-commerce ai.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:17,760
Today I will be exploring how strategic
prompt design can harness the power

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,880
of AI to transform the tools we
provide to online sellers, and in

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,530
turn, enhance the customer experience
across the e-commerce industry.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:36,480
By 2030, we envision a landscape
where a driven assistance are embedded

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,390
in every aspect of online retail,
and effective, prompt design will

9
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,120
be a key to making that happen.

10
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,200
For a AI to really drive this benefit,
we need to give it the right guidance.

11
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,610
And that's where prompt
engineering comes in.

12
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,610
What do I mean by prompt engineering?

13
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:05,020
Essentially, it's the practice of
grafting clear strategic instruction

14
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,480
or questions for an AA model so
that it produce the output we want.

15
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:16,720
Instead of treating the AI like
a block box, we guided step by

16
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,135
step with well-written prompts.

17
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:24,295
In e-commerce, AI isn't
just a nice to have anymore.

18
00:01:24,925 --> 00:01:28,915
It's becoming a, it's becoming
a competitive necessity.

19
00:01:29,815 --> 00:01:36,265
Companies are using AI across the board to
personalize the customer experiences, to

20
00:01:36,265 --> 00:01:43,195
forecast the demand, to automate marketing
and logistic and more and much more.

21
00:01:43,695 --> 00:01:49,845
And with the emergence of powerful
generative AI tools like Open As GBT

22
00:01:50,355 --> 00:01:58,095
or like RO Cloud, even smaller sellers
can tap into AI for things like content

23
00:01:58,095 --> 00:02:03,615
generation, answering customer questions
and making product recommendation.

24
00:02:04,245 --> 00:02:09,585
But the effectiveness of all these
application hinges on how we prompt them.

25
00:02:10,085 --> 00:02:17,825
If you give an AI a poorly word or vague
prompt, you will get a sub power result.

26
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:25,685
Conversely, your well designed prompt
can unlock incredibly useful responses.

27
00:02:26,285 --> 00:02:34,475
In short, prompt engineering is essential
to leverage as power in e-commerce and

28
00:02:34,475 --> 00:02:36,454
drive the real business value from it.

29
00:02:36,954 --> 00:02:41,394
To structure our discussion today,
here is a overview of our agenda.

30
00:02:42,114 --> 00:02:47,845
We'll start by looking at why prompt
engineering matters in this contexts.

31
00:02:47,845 --> 00:02:53,005
Essentially, how good prompts
amplify the impact of e-commerce ai.

32
00:02:53,484 --> 00:02:57,234
I will then start some prompt
strategies and best practices.

33
00:02:57,864 --> 00:03:00,864
For example, a framework called CoStar.

34
00:03:01,255 --> 00:03:03,475
To answer your prompts are effective.

35
00:03:04,255 --> 00:03:10,015
We will dive into personalization
showing how prompt driven AI can

36
00:03:10,015 --> 00:03:14,874
tailor product recommendation and
experiences for individual softwares,

37
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:21,774
and we will cover how AI can help with
inventory forecasting and dynamic price

38
00:03:21,774 --> 00:03:23,934
optimization to improve operations.

39
00:03:24,684 --> 00:03:28,184
There is lot to cover, so
let's drive in after that.

40
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:35,309
We will circle back to how AI can
generate content, things like product

41
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:41,299
listings and description and what kind
of issue o benefits that brings in.

42
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:46,249
Then we'll discuss conversational
commerce, which covers chat bots

43
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:51,109
and wise assistant, and how prompt
design guides those interactions.

44
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:55,999
Next, I also some of
the RIY and advantages.

45
00:03:56,499 --> 00:04:01,569
And finally we will look into the future
outlook toward 2030, things like that.

46
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:02,619
Let's dive in.

47
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,019
Why does prompt engineering
matter so much in e-commerce?

48
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:15,630
AI put simply and a's output depends
directly on prompt guiding it, the

49
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:22,200
quality and relevance of what AI
produce are tied to how we ask for it.

50
00:04:22,785 --> 00:04:27,465
If our instructions are vague
or poorly thought about, we

51
00:04:27,465 --> 00:04:29,445
will likely get suboptimal.

52
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:36,135
S conversely, a clear, grafted
prompt, yield more useful outputs.

53
00:04:36,615 --> 00:04:40,905
Prompt engineering also
allows us to inject our domain

54
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:44,175
knowledge into the as process.

55
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:50,414
We can incorporate our company's
specific expertise, our brand wise,

56
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:56,384
and context of our customers, right
into the prompt that makes the a

57
00:04:56,384 --> 00:04:59,715
response more relevant and on brand.

58
00:05:00,314 --> 00:05:05,145
Without that, the A might give
generic answers and don't quite

59
00:05:05,145 --> 00:05:07,934
fit our business or audience.

60
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:13,234
We should also recognize that generative
AI is already transforming e-commerce.

61
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:20,865
New AA tools like GPT and Cloud are
enabling wide range of capabilities

62
00:05:20,865 --> 00:05:24,975
from personalization, product
recommendation to automated content

63
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:27,585
generation and customer service.

64
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:33,105
Every major e-commerce player is
exploring these technologies because

65
00:05:33,105 --> 00:05:38,445
they can dramatically enhance customer
experience and streamline operations.

66
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:44,115
By mastering prompt engineering
companies can truly harness

67
00:05:44,115 --> 00:05:46,485
this generative AI revolution.

68
00:05:47,175 --> 00:05:52,515
It lets you to take these
powerful AI models and aim them

69
00:05:52,515 --> 00:05:54,344
precisely at your business.

70
00:05:54,405 --> 00:05:59,865
Problems they pay off is better
customer experience, higher sales,

71
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,940
and more efficient operations.

72
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:10,320
In soft prompt engineering turns a generic
AI into tailored AI for your e-commerce

73
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,440
needs, which is why it is so crucial.

74
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,600
So how can we craft gra great prompts?

75
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,090
There are few best practices
and even frameworks to guide us.

76
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,835
One useful checklist goes
by an acronym, CoStar.

77
00:06:27,745 --> 00:06:32,724
Which I will explain in a moment,
but let's start with simple general

78
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:40,044
principles First, it's important to set
constraints and be ready to iterate.

79
00:06:40,615 --> 00:06:45,534
When I, when you write a prompt,
include any necessary limits or

80
00:06:45,534 --> 00:06:47,695
requirements right in the text.

81
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:53,995
For example, if you need the a's
response to be under a hundred words,

82
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,669
or you wanted to avoid certain content.

83
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,719
Say that upfront.

84
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,710
Then treat prompting as
an iterative process.

85
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:08,020
Review a's output, and
refine your prompt if needed.

86
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,340
You might not get the perfect
answer on the first try,

87
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:15,070
but try tweaking the prompt.

88
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,610
You can hone in on a great result.

89
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,490
Next, consider using a
structured framework like CoStar.

90
00:07:24,104 --> 00:07:26,625
To cover all key element of a prompt.

91
00:07:27,255 --> 00:07:35,835
CoStar stands for context, objective
style tone, audience and response format.

92
00:07:36,335 --> 00:07:39,094
It is basically a prompt
writing checklist.

93
00:07:39,484 --> 00:07:41,645
Ensure your prompt addresses.

94
00:07:41,645 --> 00:07:46,354
Each of these element can lead
to more on target results.

95
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:50,945
For example, context means
providing background information.

96
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:57,710
The AA should know objective means
stating clearly what outcome you are

97
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:03,349
looking for, style and tone referred
to the manner or voice you want.

98
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:09,229
The answer audience reminds you to
indicate who is the answer is for,

99
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:13,309
and response format means telling ai.

100
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:18,840
If you want a list, a narrative
bullet point or JSON format.

101
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:25,100
By covering all these bases, you
give the AI your well-defined job,

102
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,610
which usually means a better output.

103
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,880
Another best practice is to always
provide enough context and clarity.

104
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:41,241
If you are prompt is too short or
too vague, the A might fill in the

105
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:43,491
blanks in the way you don't intend.

106
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,566
So include relevant details.

107
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:51,366
For instance, rather than asking what
product should I recommend, you might

108
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:57,276
say you are a virtual assistant helping
a customer who likes outdoor activities

109
00:08:57,665 --> 00:08:59,526
based on their browsing history.

110
00:08:59,856 --> 00:09:02,826
What product would you recommend and why?

111
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:11,465
The second prompt use the ai, a role, a
background, and a specific task, and you

112
00:09:11,465 --> 00:09:14,435
are more likely to get a useful answer.

113
00:09:14,935 --> 00:09:15,685
This type.

114
00:09:15,986 --> 00:09:22,616
This ties into defining the A's
role tone and style explicitly.

115
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:28,555
As I hinted, you can start a
prompt by setting a persona.

116
00:09:29,055 --> 00:09:35,325
Finally, use examples and format
guidelines to steer the ai.

117
00:09:35,955 --> 00:09:39,165
If you can show the
ai, what do you expect?

118
00:09:39,225 --> 00:09:41,475
Even in a small way, it helps.

119
00:09:42,435 --> 00:09:47,925
This could be as simple as providing
a sample output or explicitly saying,

120
00:09:48,315 --> 00:09:50,805
please respond in three blood point.

121
00:09:51,305 --> 00:09:53,766
For instance, you might
include in your prompt.

122
00:09:54,156 --> 00:10:00,425
Here is an example of good answer, our
answer with a sort paragraph followed

123
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:03,516
by a bullet list of three key features.

124
00:10:04,206 --> 00:10:10,476
Supplying these cues and prompts helps
the AI follow your content closely.

125
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:18,501
Remember, the AI can only do what we
ask it to do, so the more precisely

126
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:20,930
we ask, the better the results.

127
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:28,360
Now let's switch into some concrete use
cases, starting with personalization.

128
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:34,240
A powered personalization is indeed
changing the game in e-commerce.

129
00:10:34,945 --> 00:10:41,006
With the latest generative models, we
can build very rich customer profiles

130
00:10:41,126 --> 00:10:46,716
and deliver highly tailored product
recommendation and shopping experiences.

131
00:10:47,216 --> 00:10:52,526
It's, it is as if each shopper
has their own personal assistant

132
00:10:53,026 --> 00:10:55,216
guiding them through your store.

133
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,075
Here is how it works.

134
00:10:57,766 --> 00:11:01,575
Sellers can incorporate
specific customer contacts.

135
00:11:01,951 --> 00:11:06,121
And preferences us into
their prompt given to the ai.

136
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:11,491
For example, I could prompt an AI
with something like the customer

137
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:18,511
recently bought Running source and
has been browsing trial running gear.

138
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:26,571
Give that context, suggest three
other products that this customer

139
00:11:26,571 --> 00:11:28,701
is likely to be interested in.

140
00:11:29,406 --> 00:11:33,126
With a one sentence rationally for each.

141
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:39,756
By guiding the AI with kind of a detailed
contracts, it'll generate recommendation

142
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:46,196
that truly resonate with that
individual saw person's need and taste.

143
00:11:46,696 --> 00:11:52,805
Each customer in effect gets suggestions
that feel handpicked for them.

144
00:11:53,555 --> 00:11:56,040
This level of personalization increases.

145
00:11:56,825 --> 00:12:01,536
Engagement and the likelihood
that the customer finds exactly

146
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:02,885
what they're looking for.

147
00:12:03,385 --> 00:12:07,405
So what kind of impact
can personalization have?

148
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:10,135
The numbers are pretty impressive.

149
00:12:10,705 --> 00:12:16,645
Retailers who excel at personalization
product recommendation have seen up to

150
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:21,835
40% higher revenue compared to those
who don't leverage personalization.

151
00:12:22,335 --> 00:12:26,745
Customer loyalty and retention
are also a huge boost.

152
00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:34,455
Some business report or 50% higher
customer retention rates when they get

153
00:12:34,455 --> 00:12:40,125
personalization right, and personalized
suggestions often lead to bigger BA sizes.

154
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:46,225
Isis, for instance, one study
found roughly 10% increase in

155
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:50,185
average order value from the
effective product recommendation.

156
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:54,525
In short, personalization
isn't just nice to have.

157
00:12:54,915 --> 00:13:01,335
It's a significant driver of business
results when customers feels like so

158
00:13:01,665 --> 00:13:03,675
shopping experience is tailored to them.

159
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:08,745
They tend to buy more, stick
around longer and stay more loyal.

160
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:16,340
These data points underscore why investing
in a driven personalization is important.

161
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,980
Next, let's look at inventory
and demand forecasting.

162
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:28,690
Another area where AI combined with the
right prompts is making huge difference.

163
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:37,271
Traditionally forecasting demand was often
only about 60% accurate, but companies

164
00:13:37,271 --> 00:13:42,490
that have adopted a driven forecasting
have significantly improved in that.

165
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:50,156
With accuracy rising to 80%, that's
a big jump, meaning you are predict

166
00:13:50,656 --> 00:13:55,396
your prediction of what stock is
needed are much closer to reality.

167
00:13:55,816 --> 00:14:01,936
As a result, you can align stock
levels much better with actual

168
00:14:01,936 --> 00:14:06,276
customer demand, and when you
have a better handle on demand.

169
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:12,366
You avoid those detailed dreaded
stock stockouts, the situations

170
00:14:12,366 --> 00:14:14,886
where a product runs out.

171
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:23,466
In fact, a driven forecasting has been
able to cut down stockouts by up to 65%.

172
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:29,716
In some cases, think about 65%
fewer out of stock messages.

173
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:36,316
That means customers are far more li, far
more likely to find the item they want

174
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:42,376
is available, which of course translated
to more sales, happier customer.

175
00:14:42,876 --> 00:14:48,666
It is also worth noting that a
forecasting was in a much wider

176
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:54,576
range of data than traditional
methods, a human or legacy system.

177
00:14:54,996 --> 00:15:03,096
Might look only at past sales trends, but
AI can factor in unstructured data like

178
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:10,206
social media, bus weather forecast, or
news events that could influence demand.

179
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:16,026
By analyzing these additional signals
alongside the historical sales, the

180
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:23,586
AI builds a more holistic view of
what might drive demand up or down.

181
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:27,321
This often leads to
more accurate forecast.

182
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:33,831
For example, you could prompt AI
given last year sales data and the

183
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:38,871
recent virtual, so social media
maintenance of our product predict

184
00:15:38,901 --> 00:15:41,781
next month's demand for each category.

185
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:47,246
A well-designed a system will
consider both the past results

186
00:15:47,425 --> 00:15:52,131
and the current social media trend
to produce a nuanced forecast.

187
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:58,661
It might catch, say that a surgeon
online interest will likely to

188
00:15:58,661 --> 00:16:00,821
translate into higher sales next month.

189
00:16:01,331 --> 00:16:05,231
Something a traditional
model would easily miss.

190
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:11,141
This kind of smarter context of
our forecasting is becoming a real

191
00:16:11,141 --> 00:16:13,991
competitive advantage in retail

192
00:16:14,491 --> 00:16:16,231
alongside the forecasting.

193
00:16:16,771 --> 00:16:20,251
AI can help optimize pricing in real time.

194
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:26,281
Dynamic pricing means adjusting
prices on the fly based on various

195
00:16:26,281 --> 00:16:33,211
factors, and AI can juggle all those
factors for better than a person can.

196
00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:39,691
For example, an AI driven pricing model
will consider current inventory levels.

197
00:16:39,991 --> 00:16:44,101
If a product is overstocked,
it might suggest a slight

198
00:16:44,101 --> 00:16:45,781
discount to move it faster.

199
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:50,821
Whereas if the inventory is low
and demand is high, it could

200
00:16:50,821 --> 00:16:56,911
recommend holding the price steady
or even nudging it up slightly.

201
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,821
It'll look at market trends.

202
00:17:00,211 --> 00:17:05,581
If there is a surge demand for a
category or a seasoned seasonal

203
00:17:05,581 --> 00:17:10,501
uptake, then AI reacts accordingly.

204
00:17:10,861 --> 00:17:13,291
It'll monitor competitor pricing.

205
00:17:13,906 --> 00:17:19,986
If competitive drops their price, a
can quickly advise a price adjustment

206
00:17:19,986 --> 00:17:25,506
to stay competitive, and it can
even factor in customer sentiment

207
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,266
from reviews or social media.

208
00:17:28,596 --> 00:17:35,556
For instance, if a product is getting
rave reviews and a lot of bus, the

209
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:40,056
AI might recognize that people are
willing to pay a premium for it.

210
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:44,721
Whereas the negative sentiment
might trigger a price drop

211
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:46,641
or a promotional offer.

212
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:53,421
By synthesizing all these inputs,
inventory, demand, competitor pricing,

213
00:17:53,421 --> 00:17:59,871
sentiment, et cetera, a can suggest
an optimal price at any given moment

214
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:02,901
to maximize revenue or profit.

215
00:18:03,411 --> 00:18:08,411
This level of tiny, big pricing
responds much faster to market changes.

216
00:18:09,266 --> 00:18:12,056
Than any manual pricing team could.

217
00:18:12,836 --> 00:18:17,056
It helps since you are not leaving
the money on the table during the

218
00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:22,426
high demand and not stuck with
unsold stock during low demand.

219
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:23,746
In start.

220
00:18:24,106 --> 00:18:30,136
AI driven dynamic pricing can
protect margins while also keeping

221
00:18:30,136 --> 00:18:35,626
customer satisfied that prices
are far responsive to the market.

222
00:18:36,126 --> 00:18:41,046
All these improvements in
forecasting and pricing ultimately

223
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,536
source up on the bottom line.

224
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:48,276
In fact, a study by Zi Company
found that companies using

225
00:18:48,776 --> 00:18:54,941
companies using AI in their supply chain
and operations saw striking results.

226
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:56,321
They managed to reduce.

227
00:18:56,821 --> 00:19:03,601
Inventory levels by 20 to 30% on
average, which means less capital tied

228
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,541
up in stock and lower storage costs.

229
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:11,371
They also cut warehousing
costs by about 15 to 20%.

230
00:19:11,371 --> 00:19:16,521
Since with linear inventory,
you need to less space and you

231
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:18,171
can operate more effectively.

232
00:19:18,621 --> 00:19:25,821
Logistic expense fell by a similar 15
to 20% as well due to a smarter routing.

233
00:19:26,796 --> 00:19:29,706
And fewer last minute urgent shipments.

234
00:19:30,606 --> 00:19:38,046
Perhaps more impressively, these companies
decrease stockout incidents by up to 65%.

235
00:19:38,556 --> 00:19:40,776
This aligns with what
we discussed earlier.

236
00:19:41,196 --> 00:19:47,706
Better demand forecasting means self
stay stocked with what customer wants, so

237
00:19:48,096 --> 00:19:52,986
you capture more sales instead of losing
customer to an out of stock message.

238
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:55,626
They also reported improvements in.

239
00:19:56,211 --> 00:19:57,411
Sell through rates.

240
00:19:57,911 --> 00:20:02,051
All of these metrics
add up to a major ROI.

241
00:20:02,111 --> 00:20:06,761
From A Driven Operations, you
are cutting cost in inventory

242
00:20:06,761 --> 00:20:11,621
and logistic and simultaneously
increasing revenue by selling more

243
00:20:11,621 --> 00:20:14,141
of what you are, what you stock.

244
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:21,101
It's great illustration that investing in
AI and pro engineering isn't just about.

245
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:22,301
Cool tech.

246
00:20:22,391 --> 00:20:28,691
It has tangible business benefits from
efficiency guide to revenue growth.

247
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:35,941
Now sift our focus to content creation,
specifically how AI can generate

248
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:40,681
product listing and description
and what that means for ses.

249
00:20:41,521 --> 00:20:45,411
As many of writing good
product copy for every item.

250
00:20:46,056 --> 00:20:51,756
The titles, the description, the bullet
point features can be very time consuming.

251
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:59,016
Generative AI has gotten surprisingly good
at producing this kind of content today.

252
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:04,386
Instead of writing each description
from scratch, a seller can provide

253
00:21:04,386 --> 00:21:09,576
an AI with a few key details, say
a list of feature, some keywords.

254
00:21:10,011 --> 00:21:15,141
Or even an image and the AI
will draft a complete engaging

255
00:21:15,501 --> 00:21:16,971
product listing for them.

256
00:21:17,421 --> 00:21:24,201
It's like having a junior copywriter
working 24 by seven on your catalog.

257
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,851
The efficiency gains here are huge.

258
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:34,661
One small business reported that a cut
their product listing creation time from

259
00:21:34,931 --> 00:21:38,741
60 minutes per item to just 15 minutes.

260
00:21:39,241 --> 00:21:43,471
Imagine going from an hour of
human work to a quarter of an

261
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:45,391
hour with the AI assistant.

262
00:21:45,841 --> 00:21:52,861
That's a 75% time saving, multiplied
across hundreds of thousands of product.

263
00:21:53,401 --> 00:21:58,801
This is a MA massive boost in
productivity, and if it is not just

264
00:21:58,876 --> 00:22:04,651
about speed, the AI content often
produce an Siva boost as well.

265
00:22:05,506 --> 00:22:13,036
The AI naturally weaves in relevant
keyword to product copy, which helps those

266
00:22:13,036 --> 00:22:15,796
listing rank higher in search results.

267
00:22:16,246 --> 00:22:22,846
In one case, after switching to age and
listing, a retailer saw a 20% increase in

268
00:22:22,846 --> 00:22:29,381
our kind of tracker to organic traffic and
about 15% higher sales for those products.

269
00:22:30,076 --> 00:22:36,946
So the AI was effectively doing some
EO optimization on top of saving time.

270
00:22:37,446 --> 00:22:42,056
AI can also enhance the shopping
experience in another base.

271
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:45,596
One example is summarizing
customer reviews.

272
00:22:46,586 --> 00:22:51,296
Popular products might have hundreds
or thousands of reviews, far too

273
00:22:51,296 --> 00:22:53,521
many for any shopper to read through.

274
00:22:54,021 --> 00:22:59,721
A can help by reading all those
reviews and generating a concise

275
00:22:59,721 --> 00:23:01,851
summary of common points.

276
00:23:02,241 --> 00:23:08,871
Essentially, I produce a high highlight
reel of pros, cons, and recurring

277
00:23:08,991 --> 00:23:11,361
themes that customers mention.

278
00:23:11,861 --> 00:23:17,296
Another frontier of e-commerce
AI is conversational commerce.

279
00:23:17,866 --> 00:23:22,726
Using chatbots and wise
assistance to engage customer.

280
00:23:23,296 --> 00:23:26,806
This is all about making the
online shopping experience more

281
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:29,326
interactive and human-like.

282
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:36,376
Human-like through conversation for a
chat bot or a wise assistant To be truly

283
00:23:36,376 --> 00:23:43,306
effective, it needs two things well
grafted prompts, driving its dialogue and

284
00:23:43,306 --> 00:23:45,886
access to the right data in real time.

285
00:23:46,471 --> 00:23:52,831
In other words, behind every helpful
chat bot response, there is a carefully

286
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:59,631
designed prompt or script and a connection
to UpToDate information like product

287
00:23:59,631 --> 00:24:05,931
details, order statuses, or customer
profiles to ground that response.

288
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:13,191
When done right, the result is a
bot that responds in a very natural.

289
00:24:13,596 --> 00:24:19,626
Helpful manner and can retrieve the
information it needs on the fly.

290
00:24:20,496 --> 00:24:25,866
Retailers today are using
chatbots for more than basic FAQs.

291
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:31,506
These bots are starting to handle
fairly sophisticated tasks.

292
00:24:31,836 --> 00:24:36,486
For example, a customer might
tell a chatbot, I am looking for

293
00:24:36,486 --> 00:24:39,126
a gift for my 10-year-old niece.

294
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,201
She loves science kits.

295
00:24:42,126 --> 00:24:46,986
The chat bot can ask a few smarter
follow up questions and then

296
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,546
recommend a suitable product.

297
00:24:48,996 --> 00:24:54,156
It is not just about answering questions,
it's guiding product discovery.

298
00:24:54,696 --> 00:24:59,856
These chat bots can also handle
upselling and cross-selling.

299
00:25:00,356 --> 00:25:06,236
For instance, out helping you to find
a laptop for a graphic design, the bot

300
00:25:06,236 --> 00:25:09,236
might suggest a compatible monitor.

301
00:25:09,626 --> 00:25:16,406
Or a productive case, much like an
in-store sales assistant might do.

302
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:22,816
Analysts predict that by 2027,
a significant chunk of customer

303
00:25:22,816 --> 00:25:26,806
service interaction will
be handled by AI chat bots.

304
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:33,376
As companies embrace their capabilities,
we are also seeing a shift from a

305
00:25:33,376 --> 00:25:36,526
chat bot being used only for support.

306
00:25:37,216 --> 00:25:40,006
Into being used as sales assistance.

307
00:25:40,546 --> 00:25:47,355
Modern a h Bots powered by advanced
language models can maintain context over

308
00:25:47,835 --> 00:25:50,716
multiple back and forth interactions.

309
00:25:51,196 --> 00:25:56,355
They remember what the customer said
earlier in the conversation, which

310
00:25:56,355 --> 00:26:01,815
shows the interaction to flow naturally
just like a human conversation.

311
00:26:02,386 --> 00:26:05,686
These bots are getting
quite good at understanding.

312
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:10,620
Nuanced inquiries and
providing personalized advice.

313
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:16,380
It is not hard to imagine that soon
when you are on an e-commerce site.

314
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:23,130
The chat bot might feel as capable
as a well-trained human salesperson

315
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,380
who knows all the products.

316
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:30,360
In fact, some online retailers
have already moved beyond

317
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:34,771
basic customer service bots to
deeply sophisticated a agent.

318
00:26:35,271 --> 00:26:40,791
That can handle anything from product
recommendation to closing a sale.

319
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:46,331
The common thread with both chat bots
and voice assistant is that their

320
00:26:46,331 --> 00:26:52,501
effectiveness comes down to the prompt and
their design of their conversational flows

321
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:58,291
the better we design this interaction,
giving the AI clear instruction plenty

322
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:00,901
of context and access to the data.

323
00:27:01,306 --> 00:27:06,856
The more helpful and natural the
experience become for the customer.

324
00:27:07,356 --> 00:27:12,816
Now, to make these conversational
agent really effective, we have to

325
00:27:12,816 --> 00:27:16,146
be smart about how we set them up.

326
00:27:16,566 --> 00:27:22,146
In other words, how we engineer the
prompts and incorporate customer

327
00:27:22,146 --> 00:27:26,916
data, one key strategy is to inject.

328
00:27:27,471 --> 00:27:29,511
Relevant data into the prompt.

329
00:27:30,011 --> 00:27:35,381
We also make use of system
roles and personas when

330
00:27:35,381 --> 00:27:37,301
configuring these assistance.

331
00:27:37,871 --> 00:27:44,171
This means we explicitly tell AI
what its role is on how to behave.

332
00:27:44,671 --> 00:27:50,431
Another important topic is guiding the
a's action through the conversation.

333
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:53,041
We don't just let the bot.

334
00:27:53,566 --> 00:27:55,126
Wing it entirely.

335
00:27:55,636 --> 00:28:01,506
We provide a sort of conversational
blueprint, and we definitely want

336
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:06,966
the AI to maintain context and
reasoning throughout the conversation.

337
00:28:07,506 --> 00:28:13,536
In practical terms, this means
as conversation goes on, we keep

338
00:28:13,536 --> 00:28:16,566
giving the AI the relevant history.

339
00:28:17,066 --> 00:28:21,386
When companies implement these
sophisticated AI assistance, they

340
00:28:21,386 --> 00:28:25,676
are seeing measurable improvement
in customer related metrics.

341
00:28:25,736 --> 00:28:30,446
For instance, a large set of
customer inquiries can now be handled

342
00:28:30,806 --> 00:28:36,571
automatically by chat bots, especially
the routine repetitive questions.

343
00:28:37,191 --> 00:28:39,491
On average, about 70% of.

344
00:28:40,331 --> 00:28:45,011
Routine customer inquiries
can be handled or solved by AI

345
00:28:45,311 --> 00:28:47,801
without needing a human agent.

346
00:28:48,281 --> 00:28:56,021
Customer can get instant answer at any
time, and your support team is freed up.

347
00:28:56,021 --> 00:28:58,451
Toggle the more complex issues.

348
00:28:58,951 --> 00:29:04,261
There is also evidence that
having immediate AI assistance

349
00:29:04,591 --> 00:29:06,151
during the shopping experience.

350
00:29:06,556 --> 00:29:09,736
Process or reduces court amendment.

351
00:29:09,736 --> 00:29:17,236
Some retailers have been roughly, yeah,
12% reduction in court amendment rates.

352
00:29:17,296 --> 00:29:22,486
After introducing AA system
and more importantly, customer

353
00:29:22,486 --> 00:29:26,026
satisfaction, CSAT tends to go up.

354
00:29:26,626 --> 00:29:30,496
Softwares appreciate getting
quick, helpful services.

355
00:29:30,996 --> 00:29:33,336
In fact, companies have reported that.

356
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:40,146
Their CSAT scores improving significantly
with a assisted support, in some cases

357
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:43,926
raging around 90 per 95% satisfaction.

358
00:29:44,426 --> 00:29:48,356
Let's step back and talk
big picture for a moment.

359
00:29:48,776 --> 00:29:51,596
Specifically, competitive advantage.

360
00:29:52,046 --> 00:29:57,921
Adopting AI and prompt engineering
early can give your company a mood.

361
00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:05,291
That late adapters will struggle
to cross being a first mover in

362
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:12,331
developing a strong AI and prompting
strategies yield compounding benefits.

363
00:30:12,931 --> 00:30:20,101
You get to lean early IT rate
and refine what works over time.

364
00:30:20,131 --> 00:30:25,081
You build up a library of
effective prompts and process that

365
00:30:25,081 --> 00:30:26,731
are tailored to your business.

366
00:30:27,231 --> 00:30:33,501
If a competitor waits a few years to
start, they will not only be playing

367
00:30:33,501 --> 00:30:38,841
catch up on technology, but they will
miss all those hard earned lessons.

368
00:30:39,501 --> 00:30:40,671
You have a accumulated.

369
00:30:41,271 --> 00:30:45,561
In other words, the gap wides
and early adopters can pull

370
00:30:45,561 --> 00:30:47,106
further and further ahead.

371
00:30:47,606 --> 00:30:54,206
This dynamic is why we see so much
urgency among execution about ai.

372
00:30:54,686 --> 00:31:01,256
In fact, roughly 80% of executives
expect AI to sign significantly,

373
00:31:01,256 --> 00:31:07,406
transform their business in next few
years, and there are investing heavily

374
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:10,156
to make sure they are not left behind.

375
00:31:10,656 --> 00:31:15,746
Those who integrate AI deeply into
their operations now will develop

376
00:31:16,076 --> 00:31:20,486
expertise and data advantage
that become very hard to match.

377
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:26,126
The competitive gap will become, will
widen between companies building their

378
00:31:26,126 --> 00:31:33,146
AI and data playbooks today, and those
sitting on the sites, the A model

379
00:31:33,206 --> 00:31:35,366
themselves, are available to everyone.

380
00:31:35,996 --> 00:31:42,526
But how you can use them can start you
to can set you apart your proprietary

381
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:49,096
customer data, plus your unique prompt
engineering know how, essentially form

382
00:31:49,096 --> 00:31:52,126
a secret recipe that others can copy.

383
00:31:52,846 --> 00:31:59,356
So embarrassing prompt engineering
early isn't just about short term wins.

384
00:31:59,476 --> 00:32:03,586
It's about securing your
piece as a leader long term.

385
00:32:04,546 --> 00:32:09,016
With AI capabilities that
become a true competitive mode.

386
00:32:09,516 --> 00:32:12,546
Now let's look at to the future.

387
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:17,046
What might e-commerce a
tools look like by 2030?

388
00:32:17,616 --> 00:32:22,746
A lot of experts predict that the
way we interact with technology in

389
00:32:22,746 --> 00:32:28,236
retail will evolve dramatically,
and a will be the center of it.

390
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:30,186
One big change will be.

391
00:32:30,756 --> 00:32:33,486
The rise of natural language interfaces.

392
00:32:34,386 --> 00:32:36,876
We have touched on this idea.

393
00:32:37,266 --> 00:32:41,856
Instead of using complex dashboard
or forms, we will interact with

394
00:32:41,856 --> 00:32:47,256
our business systems by simply
talking or typing in plain language.

395
00:32:47,756 --> 00:32:52,616
We also expect digital domains
of customers to become a key

396
00:32:53,196 --> 00:32:57,601
digital domain is like a virtual
model of a customer built.

397
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:04,391
From all their data by 2030, companies
might maintain a digital twin for

398
00:33:04,421 --> 00:33:10,931
each shopper, an a representation that
predicts their preference and behavior.

399
00:33:11,351 --> 00:33:13,871
This would enable hyper-personalization.

400
00:33:14,371 --> 00:33:17,496
Another concept is autonomous workflows.

401
00:33:17,586 --> 00:33:23,256
This means end-to-end process in your
business that an AI handles automatically.

402
00:33:23,706 --> 00:33:24,906
We already see.

403
00:33:25,416 --> 00:33:29,126
Pieces of this yeah, auto recording stock.

404
00:33:29,626 --> 00:33:36,726
So when inventory is low, but in the
future, entire multi-step workflows

405
00:33:36,726 --> 00:33:39,936
might run with minimum human oversight.

406
00:33:40,436 --> 00:33:43,886
We can't forget AI Coates for employees.

407
00:33:44,366 --> 00:33:50,906
Think of an AI coate as a smart agent
working alongside your team or even.

408
00:33:51,746 --> 00:33:58,356
Taking a certain task for operation
managers, omnichannel orchestration

409
00:33:58,356 --> 00:34:01,086
will likely be powered by ai.

410
00:34:01,686 --> 00:34:06,606
As the line blurs between online
and offline shopping, AI will help

411
00:34:06,606 --> 00:34:09,486
ensure a seamless customer journey.

412
00:34:10,326 --> 00:34:15,201
And finally, we'll see AI
providing perspective insights.

413
00:34:16,101 --> 00:34:20,420
Routinely today, a lot of
analytics are descriptive.

414
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:28,180
A also will help very good at prescriptive
analytics telling us what we should do.

415
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:34,091
It would say, you are sales
are down 5% this week.

416
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,735
It'll add and I recommend
you to X to fix it.

417
00:34:39,235 --> 00:34:45,775
This turns AI into not just an analyst,
but strategic advisor for business.

418
00:34:46,275 --> 00:34:51,886
To make this future a bit more concrete,
let's zoom in on the idea of natural

419
00:34:51,886 --> 00:34:54,150
language interfaces replacing dashboard.

420
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:59,760
Today, if a manager wants a specific
report or insight, they type,

421
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:03,990
they typically have to navigate
a dashboard or a run inquiry.

422
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:10,080
In some analytics tool, it's doable,
but often only those with some

423
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,330
training can get the data they need.

424
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:18,961
In the future, the manager might ask
an AA assistant in plain English or

425
00:35:18,961 --> 00:35:20,790
whatever their preferred language.

426
00:35:21,405 --> 00:35:24,375
And get answer with an explanation.

427
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:25,986
Begin the screens.

428
00:35:26,486 --> 00:35:29,305
It might pull up last week sale data.

429
00:35:29,966 --> 00:35:35,185
Identify the top sell list, and then
analyze various factors to answer why.

430
00:35:35,905 --> 00:35:39,926
Maybe it finds that one of
the top products sold well,

431
00:35:40,645 --> 00:35:42,325
because there was a promotion.

432
00:35:42,745 --> 00:35:47,006
Another because of social media
posts went viral and so on.

433
00:35:47,506 --> 00:35:53,836
All of that would come as a conversational
answer in second with no one having

434
00:35:53,836 --> 00:35:55,695
to manually compile a report.

435
00:35:56,145 --> 00:36:00,995
This kind of interfaces could
really democratize data access

436
00:36:00,995 --> 00:36:01,865
within the organization.

437
00:36:02,365 --> 00:36:09,776
So how do we get from today's capabilities
to that 2030 vision it requires.

438
00:36:10,151 --> 00:36:13,211
Investing few key areas right now.

439
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:17,830
First, build prompt engineering
expertise on your team.

440
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:25,600
Upskill your people so they know how to
work with a tools craft effective prompts.

441
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:32,530
This might involve training programs or
work have focused on AI and prompt design.

442
00:36:32,921 --> 00:36:36,220
Second, strengthen your data foundation.

443
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,731
A is only as good as the data its feed.

444
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:44,965
Take a hard look at ev, your
e-commerce data, product data,

445
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:47,935
customer data, sales, analytics.

446
00:36:48,175 --> 00:36:50,386
All of it is it well organized?

447
00:36:50,656 --> 00:36:53,656
Is it accessible to the AI when needed?

448
00:36:54,016 --> 00:36:56,056
Are we capturing the right information?

449
00:36:56,536 --> 00:37:01,666
Investing in clean and structuring
your data, perhaps integrating

450
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:04,096
your data system across will pay.

451
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:10,801
Huge dividend the third, adopt an AI
first culture within your organization.

452
00:37:11,161 --> 00:37:17,611
Encourage your teams to ask how can
we use AI to dackle this problem?

453
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:22,100
Finally, start pilot project
and build a playbook.

454
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,861
By focusing on people skills, data
culture, and pilot project, you

455
00:37:26,861 --> 00:37:30,250
will prepare your organization
to fully leverage prompt.

456
00:37:30,955 --> 00:37:33,715
Prompt guided AI in coming years.

457
00:37:34,215 --> 00:37:39,945
To wrap up, I would like to leave
you this thought By embracing prompt

458
00:37:39,945 --> 00:37:46,575
engineering and weaving AI into
fabric of your operation, e-commerce

459
00:37:46,575 --> 00:37:51,275
business can unlock unprecedented
gains in effective efficiency,

460
00:37:51,545 --> 00:37:54,845
personalization, and competitiveness.

461
00:37:55,345 --> 00:37:56,035
Thank you.
