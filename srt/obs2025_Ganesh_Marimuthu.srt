00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,160
Everyone.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:06,040
In today's session we'll develop into
the fascinating world of observability

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,630
in modern pressure trading platforms.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:14,340
These systems, which handle vast amounts
of market data and execute rates in

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,560
microseconds face immense challenges
when it comes to maintaining performance.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,950
As the complexity of high frequency
trading increases, traditional monitoring

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,990
solutions are no longer sufficient.

8
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,950
Through this discussion, we'll explore
how advanced observability tools

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,879
like distributed tracing, machine
learning driven anomaly detection,

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,910
cloud native observability, pipelines,
transforming how we monitor.

11
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:48,410
Let's dive into how observability is
revolutionizing high trading and shaping

12
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,660
the future of treasury operations.

13
00:00:51,349 --> 00:00:57,635

19
00:01:25,124 --> 00:01:26,564
Which is a product of Aon.

20
00:01:26,864 --> 00:01:32,079
I have involved in design, development
and optimization of a trading strategies,

21
00:01:32,529 --> 00:01:37,240
leverage advanced quantitative
models and market data analytics.

22
00:01:38,169 --> 00:01:43,299
My work includes implementing
high frequency trading algorithms,

23
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:45,039
market making strategies.

24
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:50,429
Trading strategies that have
significantly improved execution,

25
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,889
efficiency and profitability.

26
00:01:53,389 --> 00:01:59,479
My product knowledge or experience
encompasses a range of financial

27
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,549
products, including US treasuries.

28
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:07,669
Be it swift messages or ISO
related packs or messages.

29
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:11,630
I have extensive experience
supporting all of them.

30
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:18,070
Both my career, I have built reputation
for managing lining and optimizing

31
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,070
advanced technology infrastructures that.

32
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:26,510
Deep dive into how this availability is
revolutionizing high sequential trading

33
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:33,070
and shaping the future of how pressure
operations will be vulnerability in

34
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,660
modern pressuring trading platforms.

35
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,920
So drawing from my experience building
and ture at major financial institutions.

36
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:47,100
I will share how modern observability
practices are revolutionizing operations

37
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,299
in systems where reliability directly
impacts the financial outcome.

38
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:57,829
Okay, we'll examine how observability
solutions monitor systems processing

39
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,695
each 0.4 terabytes of market data
daily with algorithmic engines.

40
00:03:03,195 --> 00:03:08,355
0.5% of treasury at
speeds of 45 microseconds.

41
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,695
Unbelievable amount of data that is being.

42
00:03:13,195 --> 00:03:17,484
Join me as we dive into the
technical components that

43
00:03:17,484 --> 00:03:19,825
enable this performance and.

44
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:24,195
Of the modern training
more than 8.4 terabytes.

45
00:03:24,695 --> 00:03:31,170
We recently implemented database
using KD, which used to process

46
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,380
about three to 600 million a day.

47
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:43,829
For several dealer to dealer markets,
52.5% of algo trading algorithm,

48
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,349
big trading percentage of tertiary
trade executed by the algorithms.

49
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:53,929
We also try to integrate smart
order router, which process more

50
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:58,289
than 75% in few of the exchanges.

51
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:00,209
Famous like Nasdaq.

52
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:04,269
A broker dealer and and
these are the exchanges.

53
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:05,579
Execution is

54
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:06,589
latency.

55
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:09,159
85 key messages per second.

56
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:12,909
That's the throughput of market
data in the peak conditions.

57
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:18,879
The pure volume and velocity of modern
pressure trading creates unprecedented

58
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:23,949
observability challenges with microsecond
level predict making and execution.

59
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:27,904
Predictional monitoring
approaches simply cannot.

60
00:04:28,404 --> 00:04:32,484
These systems operate at a scale
where even minor performance

61
00:04:32,484 --> 00:04:36,084
and degradations can result in
significant financial demand.

62
00:04:36,584 --> 00:04:37,604
Moving on to the next slide.

63
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:41,109
So attributed RAC in treasury training.

64
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:46,629
So basically this is the empty mean
time to resolution or resolution.

65
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:51,709
Implementation of distributed tracing
across trading microservices has

66
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:58,689
TR by 78%, enabling faster response
and critical trading operations.

67
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:04,829
End-to-end visibility races now connect
across previously siloed components,

68
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:07,019
providing transparency from market data.

69
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:13,399
Very key for locking the trades where
you place an order and it has to get

70
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,249
filled to get the right match place.

71
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:20,929
Analytics identify bottlenecks in the
trading pipeline, allowing for targeted

72
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,509
optimizations that have improved
average execution times by 23% low.

73
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:28,889
Tracing ads less than 2.5
microseconds of overhead.

74
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:33,259
Maintaining critical performance while
providing observability, distributed

75
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:39,349
ing has transformed troubleshooting
trading platforms, enabling teams to

76
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:45,619
follow transactions across complex,
massive microservice architectures

77
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,139
without compromising performance.

78
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,669
Anomaly detection within learning.

79
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:56,479
So our ML powered anomaly detection
systems that achieve 85% accuracy in

80
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,669
identifying trading pattern deviations.

81
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:04,444
This capability has prevented
millions in potential trading losses.

82
00:06:05,194 --> 00:06:11,824
By detecting market dislocations,
execution anomalies, compliance issues

83
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,864
before they impact trading outcomes.

84
00:06:14,494 --> 00:06:20,344
The system continuously learns from both
normal operations and detected anomalies,

85
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:26,539
improving detection accuracy over time
while maintaining performance under.

86
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:33,399
So as the diagram illustrates realtime
pattern recognition identifies market

87
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:37,809
anomalies within microseconds, the
historical baseline comparison,

88
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:44,459
compare current normalized patterns,
false positive reductions, learning

89
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:50,569
algorithms, minimize alert, automated
response actions, triggers, safeguards.

90
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:57,999
So here I wanna touch upon the need for
observability for trade surveillance

91
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:01,679
and spoofing in this fast evolving
landscape of treasury trading.

92
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:06,179
The need for robust trade surveillance
and observability has never been more

93
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:09,149
critical with high frequency systems.

94
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:12,289
Executing thousands of trades per second.

95
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:17,779
The ability to monitor and track every
transaction in real time is essential

96
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:23,599
for ensuring market integrity, regulatory
compliance, and risk mitigation.

97
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:28,620
Surveillance systems
identify potential market.

98
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,340
Fraud or compliance violations.

99
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,710
While observability tools provide
end-to-end visibility into the

100
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:41,540
trading process, allowing firms
to detect anomalies, optimize

101
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,820
performance, and minimize latency,
the integration of machine learning

102
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,224
for anomaly detection combined.

103
00:07:48,724 --> 00:07:51,065
Market activity and the system health.

104
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:55,045
This powerful combination ensures
that trading platforms are not

105
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:59,935
only operationally efficient,
but also compliant with evolving

106
00:07:59,935 --> 00:08:04,479
regulations in modern treasury
trading platforms, mobility growth.

107
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,519
Beyond this monitoring because proactive
approach that helps organizations

108
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:12,909
detect potential issues before
they affect the trading outcomes.

109
00:08:13,524 --> 00:08:18,394
Ensuring that systems can continue
to operate at a scale with

110
00:08:18,394 --> 00:08:20,945
the reliability and security.

111
00:08:21,445 --> 00:08:25,659
Moving on to the next slide, cloud
native observability pipelines.

112
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:29,699
So today we have ma on web services.

113
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,549
Today we have GP we.

114
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:36,439
So our cloud native observability
pipelines have transformed

115
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:43,039
monitoring increasing capabilities
by almost 30% while reducing

116
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:45,049
operational cost by percent.

117
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:50,739
These pipelines process over 36
million metric data points per

118
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:56,049
minute, enabling real-time visibility
across global trading operations.

119
00:08:56,549 --> 00:09:01,199
By separating collection from
processing and storage, the architecture

120
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:06,329
maintains a resilience during market
volatility when observability becomes

121
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:10,099
most critical, depends on all these.

122
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:14,905
So it's like data collection,
processing, enrichment, storage and

123
00:09:14,905 --> 00:09:17,485
indexing, visualization and alert.

124
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:23,015
So by data collection, the invest
metric logs, traces from the system

125
00:09:23,015 --> 00:09:27,665
at source, process enrichment like
izing data with business metadata

126
00:09:27,665 --> 00:09:29,915
and producing the noise storage.

127
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:33,709
Optimizing for both realtime
queries and historical analysis.

128
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:39,540
K db the pick database or MongoDB, the
NoSQL database are completely efficient

129
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,689
and for such observability pipelines.

130
00:09:43,189 --> 00:09:46,219
Moving on to the next slide.

131
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:49,764
Smart Router integration, as the.

132
00:09:50,264 --> 00:09:54,904
Algorithmic trading where, be it the
dealer to dealer or a dealer to fly

133
00:09:54,904 --> 00:10:02,104
market, the algorithm Smart order
decides how the order would get routed

134
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:10,184
based on the, and it's smartly tax
and allocate the is required by the.

135
00:10:10,684 --> 00:10:15,154
Round time measurement, continuous
monitoring of auto transmission

136
00:10:15,154 --> 00:10:20,094
and acknowledgement agency venue
responsiveness, measuring performance

137
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:26,184
variations between paying destinations,
flip page analysis, realtime comparison

138
00:10:26,184 --> 00:10:27,564
of expected results, execution prices.

139
00:10:28,064 --> 00:10:32,214
This is very key because sometimes
the mass the smart order router

140
00:10:32,544 --> 00:10:38,634
may or may not execute, add the
desire to fill for that particular

141
00:10:38,634 --> 00:10:40,794
instance, which the Desco wants.

142
00:10:41,424 --> 00:10:45,444
So the realtime comparison of the expected
versus actual execution crisis is very

143
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,724
critical, which has to be observed.

144
00:10:48,224 --> 00:10:53,054
This integration creates powerful
feedback loops that continuously

145
00:10:53,054 --> 00:10:56,864
optimize order routing decisions
based on real-time performance data.

146
00:10:57,364 --> 00:11:03,094
Our implementation has improved overall
execution quality by 17%, while reducing

147
00:11:03,514 --> 00:11:08,104
diverse selection by monitoring venue
specific patterns that might indicate

148
00:11:08,374 --> 00:11:10,414
information leakage or toxic flow.

149
00:11:10,914 --> 00:11:12,084
Moving on to the next slide.

150
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:17,894
So this is basically the system latency
variations that is described here where

151
00:11:18,074 --> 00:11:23,499
the heat load is shown by the light
orange and baseline latency in the red.

152
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:28,349
The pressure trading systems
experience latency variations of up

153
00:11:28,349 --> 00:11:32,399
to 20% under three flow conditions,
particularly during the market openings.

154
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:35,249
Economic announcements, auctions.

155
00:11:35,954 --> 00:11:39,875
Any key IPOs that go online.

156
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:44,945
Observability solutions must
adapt to these variations

157
00:11:44,945 --> 00:11:46,865
without introducing performance.

158
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:55,060
In, in this, if you notice at 9:00 AM 9:30
AM the peak volatility latency is gone.

159
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,370
During it has gone down and
during the market close.

160
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,460
Quantum computing advances,
cryptographic protections.

161
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,510
Trading platforms are implementing
quantum resistant approaches to

162
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:12,100
monitoring these techniques ensure the
sensitively trading data remains secure.

163
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,200
Even as cryptographic standards.

164
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,590
You all early implementations
have demonstrated that quantum

165
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,030
resistant approaches can be.

166
00:12:19,435 --> 00:12:23,215
Integrated with minimal performance
impact by providing future

167
00:12:23,215 --> 00:12:24,895
proof security guarantees.

168
00:12:25,395 --> 00:12:30,135
Homomorphic encryption, enabling analysis
of encrypted metrics without decryption,

169
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:35,535
maintaining privacy while allowing
alerting on sensitive trading data.

170
00:12:35,595 --> 00:12:40,005
This technology for both compliance
with data regulations while.

171
00:12:40,505 --> 00:12:43,085
Quantum random number
generation leveraging quantum

172
00:12:43,585 --> 00:12:43,705
approach.

173
00:12:44,205 --> 00:12:48,495
Implementing lattice based cryptographic
algorithms to secure monitoring data

174
00:12:48,495 --> 00:12:49,875
against potential quantum attacks.

175
00:12:49,905 --> 00:12:53,985
These algorithms ensure that today's
encrypted observability data remains

176
00:12:53,985 --> 00:12:56,055
protected against decryption.

177
00:12:56,555 --> 00:12:57,755
This is the post Quantum.

178
00:12:58,255 --> 00:12:59,605
On the next slide.

179
00:13:00,105 --> 00:13:03,665
Blockchain based audit systems
blockchain based audit systems are

180
00:13:03,665 --> 00:13:07,895
transforming ti market infrastructure
by creating the immutable records

181
00:13:07,925 --> 00:13:09,455
of all trading activities.

182
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:14,555
Systems have reconciliation cost by
82% while providing near realtime

183
00:13:14,555 --> 00:13:16,235
catch visibility across the parties.

184
00:13:16,735 --> 00:13:21,415
Integration of observability data with
blockchain records creates powerful new

185
00:13:21,415 --> 00:13:24,475
capabilities for regulatory reporting,
compliance monitoring, allowing for

186
00:13:24,475 --> 00:13:28,615
automated deduction of potential market
manipulation or trading goal violations.

187
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:33,615
So realtime settlement visibility
plans, packing of lifecycle,

188
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,405
trade lifecycle is the key.

189
00:13:36,705 --> 00:13:43,035
Back in straight through process
rates will impact the reader books,

190
00:13:43,095 --> 00:13:47,185
which may or may not be found
out until the end of the day.

191
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:49,015
So this is very critical.

192
00:13:49,015 --> 00:13:53,215
Reduce reconciliation needs single
source of across counter parties.

193
00:13:53,215 --> 00:13:55,310
Enhanced compliance,
monitoring, compliance, and

194
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,575
regulatory are becoming big.

195
00:13:56,695 --> 00:14:00,955
All these iso, all the standards
are becoming really big.

196
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:02,065
So automated re.

197
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:04,875
And as I mentioned earlier,
immutable audit trail,

198
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,005
graphically secured transaction.

199
00:14:07,505 --> 00:14:09,725
So what are the challenges
in observability?

200
00:14:10,325 --> 00:14:13,325
Performance impact data volume
management, signal versus noise.

201
00:14:13,825 --> 00:14:19,195
So observability instrumentation adds
overhead that can affect vacancy.

202
00:14:19,855 --> 00:14:24,235
Solutions include strategic
sampling, brand circuit monitoring.

203
00:14:24,735 --> 00:14:28,905
Design specifically for ultra low
latency environments, data volume

204
00:14:28,905 --> 00:14:32,535
management systems generate terabytes
of telemetry data processing.

205
00:14:32,535 --> 00:14:35,745
This volume is in real time queries,
sophisticated pipelines and storage

206
00:14:35,745 --> 00:14:37,995
solutions optimized for time series.

207
00:14:37,995 --> 00:14:42,225
Data effective implementations
use steered storage approaches.

208
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,750
The hot data kept in memory and
cold data automatically archive

209
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,480
cost effective storage while
maintaining query capabilities.

210
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:53,040
KDB, which I explained couple of
slides earlier, was one of the key

211
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:58,800
databases which we have implemented in
the past that has proven to proven to

212
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,740
mitigate such data volume management.

213
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,020
Advanced correlation contextualization
techniques combined with machine

214
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,140
learning help identify fully
actionable insights among the noise

215
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,820
of normal market fluctuations.

216
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,240
Addressing these challenges require a
balanced approach that considers both

217
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,660
technical and business requirements, the
most successful implementations, line

218
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,435
availability strategies with specific.

219
00:15:21,935 --> 00:15:23,380
So what are.

220
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:29,030
And conclusions, the future of pressure
trading observability lies systems

221
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,780
that not only monitor, but impact
organizations, especially the financial

222
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,840
organizations, that capabilities will
gain significants and efficiency,

223
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,430
compliance, and ultimately profitability.

224
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,990
So assessment.

225
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:46,930
Then comes the architecture design,
develop observability framework that

226
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,340
minimizes performance impact, progressive
implementation, deploy instrumentation

227
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,950
and phase validating performances at each
stage, and continuous optimization refine

228
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,170
based on operational insights and evolving
creating factors mean time to, me,

229
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:07,830
quality, lower operational,
past and enhanced risk as market

230
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:12,595
complex increases becomes not just
an operational but competitive

231
00:16:12,595 --> 00:16:15,665
necess and, that's pretty much it.

232
00:16:16,205 --> 00:16:18,265
We conclude this presentation.
