1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,470
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,190
My name is Marina Goplacheva.

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,240
I am a product manager.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,289
I've been working on a few AI products
for several years now, specifically

5
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:12,950
enterprise applications in HR tech domain.

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,769
And today I'm going to share with
you my professional experience and

7
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:22,500
what I've learned from building
conversational AI experiences in HR tech.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,849
First of all, just briefly, I would
like to say a few words on what

9
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:30,260
exactly I mean by conversational AI.

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,500
I think it is important
because the terminology in

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,380
this space is somewhat fuzzy.

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,679
Although, it's not that new.

13
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:43,020
Some years ago, it was mostly chatbots.

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,770
It is the application of machine learning
that enables people to communicate

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,090
with mobile apps, interfaces, devices,
et cetera, using your own words.

16
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,560
It's written off spoken.

17
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:03,000
The focus is also on producing
natural and seamless conversations

18
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,490
between people and computers.

19
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:09,300
And usually those interactions
are designed as human as possible.

20
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,530
And voice has become a very
common modality in this

21
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,130
space for several years now.

22
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:22,610
And I think the reason that in this space
we do love voice so much is because how

23
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,859
we perceive something that can speak.

24
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:29,075
as somewhat human and intelligent.

25
00:01:29,595 --> 00:01:36,835
That's why I love this quote by Judith
Shulevitz about our minds respond

26
00:01:36,844 --> 00:01:41,475
to speech as if it were human no
matter what device it comes out of.

27
00:01:41,975 --> 00:01:47,295
But I'll talk later of, about how
it's sometimes difficult to live

28
00:01:47,305 --> 00:01:52,185
up to these expectations when you
design conversational AI experiences.

29
00:01:52,685 --> 00:01:54,795
I think conversational AI.

30
00:01:55,675 --> 00:01:59,195
is one of the best ways to
deliver value in HR tech.

31
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:04,635
I've been working in this space since
2019 and at that time it was not something

32
00:02:04,655 --> 00:02:07,375
common to use conversational AI in HR.

33
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:12,645
And I do think at that time that
was quite progressive thing to do.

34
00:02:12,955 --> 00:02:21,290
If you look now at biggest vendors in HR
tech, you'll see companies like Oracle,

35
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,240
Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, ADP, all
trying to move into this direction

36
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,350
of conversational interfaces as well.

37
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,880
why do I think conversational AI is
the best way to deliver value in HR?

38
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,600
first of all, the ability to use your
own words make a huge difference.

39
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:46,850
Employees do not need to remember a
specific term or the name of a service or

40
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,050
a specific app to get to what they need.

41
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,460
And it usually is the
case with HR services.

42
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:59,880
As someone who worked in HR tech for
years, and I love HR, I always saw

43
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:05,910
this gap of understanding between HR
and employees in terms of terminology.

44
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,210
So removing this obstacle by giving
employees Ways to get to what they

45
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:16,330
need using their own words and
understanding is, I think, a great thing.

46
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:22,270
The other thing is the one interface,
which is no interface in case of

47
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:28,840
conversational AI, and how we usually
say that it's an interface less UI

48
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,799
or in case of conversational AI.

49
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,240
And I think it's another big thing
if you work in any big enterprise.

50
00:03:37,775 --> 00:03:43,345
I'm sure you know the mess most
companies have in terms of, how

51
00:03:43,345 --> 00:03:47,235
many tools they have, systems, apps.

52
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:51,775
and that makes it very difficult
to mitigate for employees.

53
00:03:52,255 --> 00:04:01,245
So removing this mess and giving them
to use something that has one interface.

54
00:04:01,245 --> 00:04:01,935
That's one.

55
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,170
Interfaceless UI is also,
I think, a great thing.

56
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:11,120
The other thing is the ease
of use in terms of UX compared

57
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,110
to traditional HR platforms.

58
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:20,560
You usually have to invest time and effort
to teach employees to use these systems.

59
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,470
Also, if you've ever been a part of
any HR transformation, Associated

60
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:32,800
with new implementation of a new HR
platform, you will know that a lot

61
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,900
of change management is required.

62
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,610
Conversational AI takes a
lot of the change management

63
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,895
hassle out of the equation.

64
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:45,415
You also can build conversational
AI experiences on top of what

65
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:49,915
you have without re-engineering
existing systems and.

66
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:57,885
Finally, these ability of what
we call meeting users where they

67
00:04:57,885 --> 00:05:01,755
are so that they don't need to
interrupt their usual workflows.

68
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:08,795
We call those, systems, apps, messaging
apps where employees, which employees

69
00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:11,215
use in their everyday work surfaces.

70
00:05:11,535 --> 00:05:14,395
So integrating conversational AI.

71
00:05:14,795 --> 00:05:19,225
on all those surfaces seamlessly
is another great thing,

72
00:05:19,755 --> 00:05:24,225
that makes Condensational AI
great to use in HR domain.

73
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:30,285
I've designed Condensational AI skills
for nearly every aspect of HR, whether

74
00:05:30,355 --> 00:05:35,215
it was onboarding, lead management,
compensation, performance management.

75
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:43,185
I'd say not every single aspect of
HR processes can be easily designed

76
00:05:43,515 --> 00:05:45,185
in a conversational interface.

77
00:05:45,785 --> 00:05:51,185
There are some things that are
still maybe better done in a

78
00:05:51,195 --> 00:05:54,005
full UI content rich interface.

79
00:05:54,595 --> 00:06:00,185
But even those can be incorporated
and I'll talk about it as well.

80
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:04,705
So how do you build
conversational AI experiences?

81
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:10,595
First of all, I think no matter
how great your tech stack is, good

82
00:06:10,595 --> 00:06:13,025
design practices are essential.

83
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:18,365
In my view, it is foundational
for designing any kind of tech

84
00:06:18,365 --> 00:06:20,065
product which is used by humans.

85
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:25,715
And the experience of interacting with the
AI product can be fundamentally different

86
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,435
than with traditional software products.

87
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:31,095
Hence, you have to design for that.

88
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,280
If the design is not up to the level of
the technology, that itself is a barrier

89
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,670
for making the most out of these products.

90
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,500
It is a barrier for adoption and
overall results in poor experience.

91
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:50,110
And also I think part of this problem with
design practices for AI is that there is

92
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:55,580
a large knowledge gap and perhaps cultural
gap between people of a UX background and

93
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,430
people of a machine learning background.

94
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,240
So we need to think of
ways to minimize this gap.

95
00:07:01,715 --> 00:07:07,705
Try to find ways for UX designers and
ML experts to collaborate effectively.

96
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:14,121
I'm certain that UX designers nowadays
have to understand a lot better what's

97
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:17,045
happening in the backend of ML products.

98
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:23,315
You also have to design conversational
experiences with an understanding

99
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,175
of how conversation works.

100
00:07:25,675 --> 00:07:29,955
There are some scientific foundations
of how human conversation works.

101
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:35,790
We also need to remember things like
models tend to degrade and the performance

102
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,960
of the algorithm goes down with it.

103
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,200
So how do we design for that
into the product itself?

104
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,520
To make sure that we are still delivering
the performance there over time.

105
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,870
Researching and understanding your
users is also still necessary.

106
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:56,420
I remember when I was designing
voice skills for AI voice

107
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,570
assistant for internal employees.

108
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:04,585
For I was biased towards asking
questions within a voice flow as

109
00:08:04,695 --> 00:08:09,215
if it was a logic flow within the
UI app equivalent of that flow.

110
00:08:09,915 --> 00:08:14,725
And there were users who were
experienced at using assistants

111
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:17,625
like Amazon Alexa a lot at home.

112
00:08:17,815 --> 00:08:24,355
So those users interacted with voice
skills as they were talking to a human.

113
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:29,165
But those two are hugely
different mental models.

114
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:34,445
And it's a huge difference in
how you could, you would go about

115
00:08:34,535 --> 00:08:39,285
designing that AI product for
two different groups of users.

116
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:44,465
So you have to research how
people use your products or

117
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:46,685
use AI products in general.

118
00:08:46,685 --> 00:08:50,065
Just having great technology does
not mean it doesn't need to be

119
00:08:50,065 --> 00:08:51,695
designed and applied properly.

120
00:08:52,195 --> 00:08:54,475
In order to build personalized.

121
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:58,825
conversational AI experiences
at scale, you need to leverage

122
00:08:58,855 --> 00:09:00,335
the context of the users.

123
00:09:00,835 --> 00:09:05,445
To do that, you have to
invest in fixing your data.

124
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:09,485
And I'm not just talking
about data quality, but in

125
00:09:09,485 --> 00:09:12,405
building an additional layer.

126
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:20,715
That is, you have to have a high quality
codified descriptions and dictionaries

127
00:09:20,775 --> 00:09:22,825
of the data of your employees.

128
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,530
because your LLMs have
to query that context.

129
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:34,720
Another thing I would suggest is to
maybe supervise the process of AI

130
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:41,190
development, not just the outcomes,
especially when you are designing complex

131
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,490
compound conversational experiences.

132
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:50,390
and in cases when you are not, Using
public models, but starting from scratch.

133
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:54,900
Think whether it makes sense and it's
feasible to set up experiments involving

134
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,350
people in the development process.

135
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:03,899
It makes perfect sense to do
that when trying to AI, apply

136
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,090
AI to complex decision making.

137
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:11,690
It will give you invaluable
insights into what expert human

138
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,850
does and what is the ideal process.

139
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,560
And the more granular your
understanding is, the better.

140
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:23,020
My next point is on the
levels of anthropomorphism.

141
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:31,935
When I started working in conversational
AI space back in 2019, I quickly realized

142
00:10:31,935 --> 00:10:37,065
that a lot of time and effort in that
space was spent on trying to find ways

143
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:42,735
to make people feel comfortable with this
technology by putting a human face on it.

144
00:10:43,235 --> 00:10:49,585
I think I spent hours every week in
conversations about how to design

145
00:10:49,585 --> 00:10:53,015
the conversational interfaces,
trying to mimic how humans speak.

146
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:58,825
And it sounds logical, because when
you introduce language or speech into

147
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:03,935
the equation, you immediately have this
perception of these things as intelligent.

148
00:11:04,225 --> 00:11:08,965
The question for me is, that level
of anthropomorphism is needed.

149
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:10,385
Is it?

150
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:11,920
necessary?

151
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,300
Is it going to speed adoption
or make for a safer adoption?

152
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,530
Or is it just setting bad
expectations right away?

153
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:25,680
And for me, the answer is, it depends
on what you're trying to achieve.

154
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:32,410
When, for example, I analyzed how
people used the AI assistant we

155
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,550
developed for our internal employees.

156
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:39,730
We realized from the data that
people generally use conversational

157
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,010
AIs for utilitarian goals.

158
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:46,270
And their wording and
language is reflected in that.

159
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,770
AIs are tools for them.

160
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,410
So they cannot be more than
that, because humans cannot make

161
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,010
emotional connections with them.

162
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,180
And frankly, I don't think people should
make emotional connections with things.

163
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,980
Moving to my next point.

164
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:11,210
I think you do not have to limit yourself
with modalities and concepts like AI

165
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,660
thirst, voice thirst, anything thirst.

166
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,800
Yes, conversational AI is about
natural language, but it does not

167
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,010
have to be pure natural language.

168
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:27,330
Later in my career as conversational
AI product owner, my team and I

169
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:34,015
did a great job Incorporating micro
UIs into conversational AI skills.

170
00:12:34,805 --> 00:12:40,425
And so combining natural language
models with graphical UIs, you

171
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:42,865
can have the best of both worlds.

172
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:49,495
Especially in HR, it just makes sense
for main things to be able to have both.

173
00:12:49,995 --> 00:12:52,484
Again, meeting employees where they are.

174
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:57,015
On devices, platforms, systems
where they work without the need

175
00:12:57,045 --> 00:12:58,785
to break their usual workflows.

176
00:12:58,785 --> 00:13:00,875
I think it's essential.

177
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:08,545
For many years, people like me in HR tech
space struggled with this one big thing.

178
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:15,055
That people do not spend their
time on HR, in HR systems.

179
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:20,715
They primarily spend their time in other
systems, in case of knowledge workers.

180
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,460
Or in case of blue collar
workers, they don't spend that

181
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,240
much time in any system at all.

182
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:32,170
this context in which interactions
occur shapes the perceived utility

183
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,500
of success of that experience.

184
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:40,850
there was this one example of an
experience, we developed for some

185
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,700
of our employees some time ago.

186
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:49,225
And I won't go into specifics, but
it failed miserably just because we

187
00:13:49,225 --> 00:13:53,595
were so focused on the problem itself.

188
00:13:53,975 --> 00:14:00,095
And we missed the most important thing,
that in order to use that conversational

189
00:14:00,145 --> 00:14:05,105
AI skill we developed to solve one
of the pieces of work they were

190
00:14:05,115 --> 00:14:08,195
doing, and it was some tedious stuff.

191
00:14:08,605 --> 00:14:12,205
We didn't know, we did know
they didn't like to do.

192
00:14:12,475 --> 00:14:18,285
But, we ended up with people not using
it because it required these people

193
00:14:18,285 --> 00:14:20,575
to interrupt their usual workflow.

194
00:14:21,135 --> 00:14:26,295
To go to open the assistant on some other
device, and it was just not worth it.

195
00:14:26,795 --> 00:14:29,565
This interruption just
made no sense to them.

196
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:36,265
I think this thing of meeting employees
where they are is also crucial.

197
00:14:36,765 --> 00:14:41,855
And the last thing I wanted to mention
is that the important thing to remember

198
00:14:42,445 --> 00:14:49,435
is having AI doesn't mean we need
to ram it end to end AI everything.

199
00:14:50,185 --> 00:14:58,505
We still need to recognize what is good
for and what is good for and use it to

200
00:14:58,505 --> 00:15:00,425
power the most effective experience.

201
00:15:00,925 --> 00:15:05,975
Especially in a regulated domain
like HR, there may be cases where

202
00:15:06,255 --> 00:15:10,225
it may be better to leverage rigid
or more traditional technology.

203
00:15:10,815 --> 00:15:16,975
For example, with issues around payroll,
you may need direct controls there.

204
00:15:17,405 --> 00:15:24,145
So there will be cases that will
live outside of the AI components.

205
00:15:24,645 --> 00:15:30,375
And you can do a lot by how you design
the things that you do and how you create

206
00:15:30,455 --> 00:15:34,685
the user buttons and the mental model
for the person using conversational AI.

207
00:15:35,585 --> 00:15:41,615
So I think the AI first craze should
not get in the way in cases where we

208
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,645
have to put security controls in place.

209
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:50,925
In conclusion, and to wrap it
up, I think yes, as I said.

210
00:15:51,425 --> 00:15:57,195
Design practices are crucial
and they are key no matter how

211
00:15:57,195 --> 00:15:58,925
powerful the technology is.

212
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:04,185
And you have to remember that
conversational AI or any AI is a

213
00:16:04,185 --> 00:16:09,415
tool that should be aligned against
a specific business objective of

214
00:16:09,415 --> 00:16:10,765
what you are trying to achieve.

215
00:16:11,515 --> 00:16:15,345
And it's critical to consider
the state of your AI.

216
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,140
HR data, tech stack and risk
tolerance when it comes to

217
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,200
implementing conversational AI.

218
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,070
That's all from me today.

219
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:33,520
I hope you found something helpful
and useful in what I've talked about.

220
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,850
And thank you for listening.

reaching out to Just find me on LinkedIn.

222
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:49,270
I'm always happy to talk all
