The second phase is foundation building.

174
00:14:27,086 --> 00:14:30,626
This is where you implement the
core integration architecture

175
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:32,366
and security framework.

176
00:14:33,026 --> 00:14:35,966
This includes data fabric deployment.

177
00:14:36,356 --> 00:14:42,226
Security control implementation and
governance framework establishment.

178
00:14:43,156 --> 00:14:46,606
The final phase is it expansion.

179
00:14:47,536 --> 00:14:53,026
This evolves progressively
extending integration across

180
00:14:53,146 --> 00:14:55,426
additional workload and clouds.

181
00:14:55,926 --> 00:14:57,726
Thank you all for your time.

182
00:14:57,996 --> 00:15:02,436
