00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:00,740
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,569
Welcome to corner 42 cloud native 2025.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,399
I am Arun Pandian, a technology
infrastructure specialist, and I'm

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,179
going to talk about how a unified
multi cloud monitoring solution can

5
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:19,590
deliver comprehensive observability
across diverse cloud service providers.

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:26,000
So in the agenda, I will talk about the
importance of multi cloud monitoring,

7
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,249
and then the core components off multi
cloud observability and what are the

8
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:35,989
tools that can be integrated and deployed
in multi cloud monitoring, best practice

9
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,169
that can be leveraged, and at last the
future trends in cloud observability.

10
00:00:41,669 --> 00:00:46,069
I'll start with the complexities
in managing multiple clouds.

11
00:00:46,569 --> 00:00:51,219
Organizations are rapidly adopting
multiple cloud platforms to

12
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:53,579
leverage their unique strengths.

13
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,119
But they also inherit a set of
operational challenges that can

14
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:02,953
significantly impact their ability to
monitor, secure, and optimize these

15
00:01:02,953 --> 00:01:04,764
multi cloud environments effectively.

16
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:07,934
First challenge is data
silos and fragmentation.

17
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:12,294
Each cloud provider typically
comes with its own monitoring

18
00:01:12,294 --> 00:01:14,434
and logging systems or solutions.

19
00:01:15,384 --> 00:01:21,164
As a result, these solutions can
create fragmented data and making it

20
00:01:21,204 --> 00:01:26,004
difficult to derive holistic insights
without a centralized approach.

21
00:01:26,794 --> 00:01:29,334
The second is the latency
and performance bottlenecks.

22
00:01:29,779 --> 00:01:34,389
So organizations collect or gather
real time data from globally dispersed

23
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:39,649
networks, and those networking
complexities can introduce service delays.

24
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:43,669
The third one is compliance
and security visibility gaps.

25
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:49,249
So each provider offers distinct
controls and default configurations.

26
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:54,279
So uniformly enforcing security and
compliance policies across all the

27
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:56,549
cloud environments can be challenging.

28
00:01:57,279 --> 00:02:00,749
And at last, the scalability and
cost management, the volume of

29
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:05,079
the logs and metrics grows, grows
exponentially on a daily basis.

30
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:11,059
so the expense of, storing, managing and
analyzing the data, can become complex.

31
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:13,949
The next I want to talk
about, the importance of,

32
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,869
unified multicloud monitoring.

33
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:19,239
The first is the consistent,
we can achieve the consistent

34
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:20,319
operational visibility.

35
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:24,869
A centralized monitoring approach,
enable, comprehensive visibility and

36
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:28,549
understanding of what's happening within,
within multiple cloud environments.

37
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:33,639
So this holistic view makes it
easier for teams to track performance

38
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:38,479
trends, detect anomalies, and maintain
healthy application or service levels.

39
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:42,679
The next is the Simplified Incident
Response and Lucas Analysis.

40
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,829
So whenever an issue occurs,
it is essential to resolve

41
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:47,544
it quickly to meet the needs.

42
00:02:47,924 --> 00:02:54,574
the, MTTR metric, the mean time to resolve
and the unified monitoring solution help

43
00:02:54,574 --> 00:03:00,064
us to consolidate logs, metrics and events
at one particular place, to reduce the

44
00:03:00,104 --> 00:03:02,614
time spent on, in analyzing the data.

45
00:03:03,554 --> 00:03:07,724
So this streamlined approach, help,
teams, to identify the issues or

46
00:03:07,724 --> 00:03:10,414
problems quickly, drive resolution.

47
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:14,299
and even avoid prolonged
service descriptions.

48
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:18,139
The next is the enhanced reliability
and infrastructure resilience.

49
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,799
So if we, by continuously monitoring or
tracking the key performance indicators,

50
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:29,799
the KPIs, we can proactively fix
issues before they become critical.

51
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:33,879
So the insights that are gathered
highlight patents, highlight

52
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,959
the patents or irregularities.

53
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:43,289
That, help the teams, to, intelligently
scale, decisions, an auto scaling and then

54
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,159
also support the preventive maintenance.

55
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,830
And, next one is the streamlined
security and compliance monitoring.

56
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:53,661
So security and regulatory requirements
can become complicated when multiple

57
00:03:53,661 --> 00:03:55,189
cloud products are involved.

58
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:59,840
So a unified view is required to help,
standardizing monitoring practices

59
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,330
across all the cloud platforms.

60
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:08,335
and detect suspicious activities instantly
and meet the compliance requirements.

61
00:04:08,835 --> 00:04:11,655
And at last, the cost optimization
and resource efficiency.

62
00:04:12,175 --> 00:04:16,675
the multi cloud monitoring solution,
offer comprehensive visibility into

63
00:04:16,765 --> 00:04:21,845
cost and resource consumption that
allows teams to make informed decisions

64
00:04:21,885 --> 00:04:26,235
about the capacity planning, cost
allocation and optimization approaches.

65
00:04:26,735 --> 00:04:30,365
The next I will go over the core
components of, the core components

66
00:04:30,365 --> 00:04:33,455
that are involved in a multi
cloud observability solution.

67
00:04:33,955 --> 00:04:35,585
The first one is, the data collection.

68
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:40,435
Here we can aggregate the logs, metrics,
traces from diverse cloud environments

69
00:04:40,435 --> 00:04:46,155
and, utilizing, agent based or agent less
solutions to capture every critical event.

70
00:04:46,905 --> 00:04:51,975
So this continuous stream of raw
telemetry data, that supports, the

71
00:04:52,045 --> 00:04:59,745
analysis and also support to create a,
robust observability, solution or system.

72
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:02,365
The next one is data
processing and correlation.

73
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:07,255
here, if you use the advanced analytics,
machine learning and even correlation,

74
00:05:07,255 --> 00:05:12,635
we can transform the data into context
rich, insights by identifying the

75
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:16,505
patents, anomalies, and dependencies
across, distributed services.

76
00:05:16,865 --> 00:05:22,655
So this refined data set, gives, teams
the ability to diagnose issues quickly.

77
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:26,405
Accelerate the root cause analysis
and, and decision making in

78
00:05:26,615 --> 00:05:28,435
complex multi cloud, landscapes.

79
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:31,185
The other component is
observability and visualization.

80
00:05:31,555 --> 00:05:34,675
So with interactive dashboards,
health checks, and alerting

81
00:05:34,675 --> 00:05:38,745
capabilities, so we can achieve the
real time visibility into application

82
00:05:38,785 --> 00:05:40,545
performance and infrastructure status.

83
00:05:41,145 --> 00:05:46,565
so these unified views help, teams
to spot trends, isolate bottlenecks,

84
00:05:46,965 --> 00:05:48,654
and maintain seamless services.

85
00:05:48,905 --> 00:05:53,505
application, delivery, by, showcasing the
system's relationship and dependencies.

86
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:56,575
The next is automated,
remediation in incident response.

87
00:05:56,935 --> 00:05:59,865
so whenever the anomalies or
threshold features occur or

88
00:05:59,865 --> 00:06:04,185
detected, automated playbooks or
self healing mechanisms, are enabled.

89
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:08,155
So that helps us to resolve,
issues before they escalate.

90
00:06:08,795 --> 00:06:12,235
So this integrated incident
response mechanism or approach.

91
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:16,655
Ensure minimal downtime by,
orchestrating the alerts, on call

92
00:06:16,805 --> 00:06:21,095
schedules and, collaborative workflows
for rapid problem containment.

93
00:06:21,595 --> 00:06:24,425
And at last, the security
and compliance monitoring.

94
00:06:24,815 --> 00:06:27,785
so we can continuously scan
the telemetry for suspicious

95
00:06:27,785 --> 00:06:29,535
activities or policy violations.

96
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:32,785
reinforcing proactive threat
detection and compliance

97
00:06:32,865 --> 00:06:35,165
adherence, in multi cloud, setups.

98
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:39,185
So through seamless integrations
with, security frameworks and

99
00:06:39,225 --> 00:06:44,455
automated compliance checks, teams
can uphold a stringent government,

100
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:48,905
governance, mitigate risks and
satisfy the, regulatory requirements.

101
00:06:49,455 --> 00:06:53,375
there's a reference or a sample
architecture that can be even used.

102
00:06:53,735 --> 00:06:57,685
to design a unified, monitoring
system for multi cloud environments.

103
00:06:58,305 --> 00:07:00,925
So the first layer is,
data collection layer.

104
00:07:01,475 --> 00:07:06,005
the unified monitoring solution
can support multiple cloud

105
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:09,815
environments, including major
service providers, AWS, Azure,

106
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:11,635
Google Cloud, and even private cloud.

107
00:07:11,985 --> 00:07:15,895
So each cloud provider generates
logs, metrics, and events that need

108
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:18,875
to be monitored for performance,
availability, and security.

109
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,115
The next is the monitoring agents.

110
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:25,215
So the agents are deployed across
different cloud environments to

111
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:26,545
collect the observability data.

112
00:07:26,935 --> 00:07:33,115
So these agents gather log metrics and
even data from various cloud native

113
00:07:33,115 --> 00:07:34,565
services and infrastructure components.

114
00:07:35,065 --> 00:07:36,865
Then next is the data aggregation layer.

115
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:42,345
Here, the data is categorized, like
the observability data is categorized

116
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:46,545
and processed by specialized components
like log collectors, that handles the

117
00:07:46,545 --> 00:07:49,815
logs generated by the applications,
infrastructure, and cloud services.

118
00:07:50,425 --> 00:07:52,495
And the other one is
the metrics aggregators.

119
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:56,325
Here, it processes and normalizes
performance related metrics.

120
00:07:56,845 --> 00:07:59,575
the last one is the
event stream processors.

121
00:07:59,785 --> 00:08:05,295
this helps manage and analyze event driven
data streams for real time insights.

122
00:08:05,795 --> 00:08:08,005
And the next one is centralized
monitoring and analytics.

123
00:08:08,095 --> 00:08:12,495
So all the collected and processed
data is sent to a centralized

124
00:08:12,505 --> 00:08:14,375
monitoring and analytics platform.

125
00:08:14,915 --> 00:08:18,245
So this layer is responsible for,
correlating different types of

126
00:08:18,245 --> 00:08:21,935
data, detecting anomalies, and
even identifying the patents,

127
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,875
patents for, proactive monitoring.

128
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:28,125
The second last is the observability
and alerting mechanism layer.

129
00:08:28,485 --> 00:08:32,825
So these layers generate alert
alerts based on anomalies, security

130
00:08:32,825 --> 00:08:35,135
breaches, or failures, system failures.

131
00:08:35,605 --> 00:08:41,145
So they'll create real time
dashboards for visualizing the system

132
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,075
health and that is an entrance.

133
00:08:43,575 --> 00:08:46,355
And at last, we have
the incident management.

134
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:50,545
Here are the alerts from the system or.

135
00:08:51,045 --> 00:08:55,145
Are fed into ITS and tools, for
ticketing and incident resolution.

136
00:08:55,655 --> 00:09:00,375
here the next is, I'll talk about
the tools, that can be, integrated or

137
00:09:00,465 --> 00:09:02,815
deployed, in multi-cloud environments.

138
00:09:02,935 --> 00:09:06,265
first either we can use the
open source, tools or like

139
00:09:06,265 --> 00:09:08,035
commercial SaaS platforms, tools.

140
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,295
So open source tools such as like
Prometheus, Grafana, Jagger, open

141
00:09:12,295 --> 00:09:14,535
Telemetry and SaaS platforms.

142
00:09:14,535 --> 00:09:14,685
So Datadog.

143
00:09:15,185 --> 00:09:18,655
New Relic, Grafana
Cloud, Dynatrace, Plunk.

144
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:23,265
in terms of deployment, the open
source tools requires manual setup,

145
00:09:23,295 --> 00:09:24,905
configuration and maintenance.

146
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:28,385
But the SaaS platforms are
fully managed or completely

147
00:09:28,385 --> 00:09:30,315
managed by the service provider.

148
00:09:30,855 --> 00:09:33,734
it is also easily or quick
to deploy and scalable.

149
00:09:34,284 --> 00:09:42,534
also, in terms of scalability, open
source tools are horizontally scalable,

150
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:46,954
but requires careful planning of
capacity and resource allocation.

151
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:51,534
But for SaaS platforms, it is
automated elastic scaling, and

152
00:09:51,534 --> 00:09:56,864
also it supports elastic scaling in
response to resource usage, and the

153
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:59,669
vendor handles the capacity planning.

154
00:10:00,219 --> 00:10:04,809
for the cost wise, open source tools
are typically free, with cost rising

155
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:09,869
from the self hosting infrastructure,
or storage, compute, networking,

156
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:14,419
and even the maintenance and the
scaling cost grow, with the usage.

157
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:19,689
And also the SaaS platform's cost is
subscription based, cost can increase

158
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:21,419
with the data ingestion and storage.

159
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:24,739
Next is, the best practices
that we can follow.

160
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:30,139
For, implementing, robust, unified
multi cloud monitoring solution.

161
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:36,209
yeah, first we can define a centralized
observability strategy to establish a

162
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:40,469
unified observability framework, that
consolidates the logs, metrics, and

163
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:42,069
traces from all the cloud environments.

164
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:46,779
And next we can adopt, a multi
layered data collection approach.

165
00:10:47,184 --> 00:10:50,224
to collect telemetry data
across infrastructure

166
00:10:50,224 --> 00:10:52,194
applications and network layers.

167
00:10:52,994 --> 00:10:59,374
And we also can normalize and correlated
data across cloud environments to

168
00:10:59,384 --> 00:11:01,994
standardize the diverse data formats.

169
00:11:02,134 --> 00:11:05,064
And even under correlate the
metrics, logs and traces.

170
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:09,089
to create actionable insights
and prevent any blind spots.

171
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:13,989
we can also implement a vendor
agnostic observability platform to

172
00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:17,979
integrate seamlessly with cloud service
providers to avoid any vendor lock in.

173
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:23,309
And, it is, possible to embed
observability into CICD workforce

174
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:27,379
to, for proactive monitoring,
automated anomaly detection, and

175
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:29,209
even faster incident resolution.

176
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:31,034
During any critical deployments.

177
00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:36,604
Also, we need to strengthen the security
compliance monitoring, to safeguard the

178
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:41,354
workloads or any application deployments
across multi cloud environments.

179
00:11:41,854 --> 00:11:45,804
So the last I'm going to talk
about the future trends in cloud

180
00:11:45,864 --> 00:11:47,384
monitoring and observability.

181
00:11:47,884 --> 00:11:50,634
The first is the AI driven
observability and anomaly detection.

182
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:56,884
So many organizations leverage some
AI driven solutions like AI powered

183
00:11:57,124 --> 00:11:58,384
analytics and machine learning models.

184
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,459
for transforming the observability by
automatically detecting, anomalies,

185
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:07,669
predictive failures, and even enabling,
some self healing capabilities

186
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:08,879
in, in multi cloud environment.

187
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:12,519
the next is the observability in
the serverless and edge computing.

188
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:16,529
if, when the workload shifted to
serverless architectures and edge

189
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:21,519
computing, observability solutions
should evolve to provide, real time

190
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,569
visibility, into those, these ephemerals.

191
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:26,589
EAL resources and highly
distributed environments.

192
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:31,919
The next is eeb, EBPF, and the kernel
level monitoring is mainly applicable

193
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,239
for the Linux, OS operating systems.

194
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:39,579
so EBPF is revolutionizing the cloud
monitoring by enabling deep, lowered

195
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:43,509
visibility into system calls, network
activities, and application behavior,

196
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:45,209
directly at the Linux current level.

197
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:48,649
the next is the shift level
observability for DevOps and Sari.

198
00:12:49,244 --> 00:12:54,274
So if we, apply observability early in the
software development life cycle, so it,

199
00:12:54,684 --> 00:13:00,814
allows DevOps and SRE teams to proactively
detect issues, optimize the performance,

200
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:04,384
and even ensure the reliability
from the beginning, reliability

201
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:05,744
of the systems from the beginning.

202
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,894
And at last, the security
driven observability, that's

203
00:13:08,894 --> 00:13:10,374
a COPS plus observability.

204
00:13:11,154 --> 00:13:14,974
So this allows, security, cloud
security teams to integrate security

205
00:13:15,034 --> 00:13:16,934
insights into observability pipelines.

206
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:20,889
to enhance threat detection,
compliance enforcement and a

207
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:24,979
proactive risk management across,
cloud native applications.

208
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:25,759
Thank you.
