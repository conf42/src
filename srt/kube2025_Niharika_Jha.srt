00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,250
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,390
I'm Neha Gupta from Microsoft and
I'm excited to welcome you to this

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:10,820
session on Kubernetes API Gateways in
Cloud Native Service Mesh Strategies.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,080
Over the next 15 minutes, we will
explore how modern enterprises are

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,420
evolving their API management practices.

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,040
And leveraging service mesh
architectures to build scalable

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,950
skin cure and observable systems.

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,900
Whether you are building large
scale distributed systems, managing

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,129
microservices across multi-cloud
environments, or modernizing

10
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:38,629
legacy applications, this session
will equip you with actionable

11
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:40,460
insights and proven patterns.

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,139
So let's dive in.

13
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:45,819
Here's a quick look at
our roadmap for today.

14
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:51,339
First, we will discuss the
challenges of scaling microservices

15
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:52,299
in Kubernetes environments.

16
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:57,309
Next, we will explore how service
mesh technologies address these pain

17
00:00:57,309 --> 00:01:01,839
points through traffic management,
security, and observability.

18
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:06,340
Then we will walk through practical
implementation strategies,

19
00:01:06,669 --> 00:01:10,400
and finally, I'll summarize
key takeaways and next steps.

20
00:01:11,394 --> 00:01:15,894
Let's start by looking at the
challenges as microservices proliferate

21
00:01:15,924 --> 00:01:21,384
across organizations, managing them
effectively becomes a real bottleneck.

22
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:26,065
We call this a service brawl,
where the number of services out

23
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:30,084
spaces, the ability of traditional
API gateways to manage them.

24
00:01:30,685 --> 00:01:35,005
Coupled with this slow deployment
velocity integration, bottlenecks that

25
00:01:35,005 --> 00:01:37,494
delay releases and reduce agility.

26
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:44,500
As Kubernetes clusters scale, the
complexity multiplies without modern

27
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,359
orchestration and traffic control, teams
struggle to deliver at cloud speed.

28
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:53,399
Traditional API Gateways were
never designed for distributed

29
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,169
container based architectures.

30
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:59,669
They often become single points
of failure, creating operational

31
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:01,409
strain and risking downtime.

32
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:06,449
Manual service discovery and static
configurations are another pain point.

33
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:08,279
Simply don't scale.

34
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:13,619
In dynamic multi-cloud environments,
persistent configuration drift across

35
00:02:13,619 --> 00:02:19,319
dev staging and production introduces
consist inconsistency and instability.

36
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:23,309
And finally, the overall
operational burden is high.

37
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:25,079
Slowing down innovation.

38
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,444
Kubernetes native, API
Gateways plus service mesh.

39
00:02:28,684 --> 00:02:31,564
This is where Kubernetes native
API Gateways combine with

40
00:02:31,564 --> 00:02:33,124
service meshes come into play.

41
00:02:33,515 --> 00:02:34,144
Together.

42
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:37,894
They create a layered architecture
that provides end-to-end traffic

43
00:02:37,894 --> 00:02:42,184
control, unified policy enforcement,
and holistic observability.

44
00:02:42,634 --> 00:02:47,614
By integrating these tools, organizations
accelerate development, enhance

45
00:02:47,614 --> 00:02:52,624
security with granular policies,
and improve reli reliability through

46
00:02:52,654 --> 00:02:58,054
advanced traffic steering the result
more agile, scalable, and resilient

47
00:02:58,054 --> 00:03:00,364
applications, and a true competitive edge.

48
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:05,375
Real world scale in production
environment, these architectures shine

49
00:03:05,915 --> 00:03:10,864
teams can seamlessly manage containerized
microservices across hybrid and

50
00:03:10,864 --> 00:03:17,915
multi-cloud setups on Azure AWS or Google
Cloud, while ensuring high availability

51
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:20,585
through automated failover mechanisms.

52
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:26,255
This reliability is key when scaling
enterprise workloads to thousands of

53
00:03:26,255 --> 00:03:29,525
services without compromising performance.

54
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,200
Let's take a deeper look
at service mesh components.

55
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:39,350
At the heart of Istio, for example, is
the control pain, managing policies and

56
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:44,420
service discovery centrally invoice site
handle, intelligent traffic, routing,

57
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,340
and load balancing at the port level.

58
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:53,120
Security is reinforced through mutual
TLS or MTLS, ensuring zero trust

59
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,799
communication between services.

60
00:03:55,459 --> 00:04:00,260
For teams looking for lighter
alternatives, LINKERD offers simplicity

61
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:05,359
and efficiency, delivering MTLS,
traffic, routing, and observability

62
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,850
with minimal resource overhead.

63
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,679
Modern service measures enable
powerful traffic management strategies.

64
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:14,894
Let's explore three key ones.

65
00:04:15,534 --> 00:04:18,140
First, automated candry deployments.

66
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,204
These progressively shift
traffic to new versions.

67
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:27,260
Monitoring health in real time and rolling
back automatically if issues arise.

68
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,960
Second circuit breakers.

69
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,340
These isolate falls and prevent
cascading failures across services

70
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,770
critical for maintaining resilience.

71
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:42,620
And third, intelligent load balancing
dynamically routing traffic based on

72
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:47,120
real-time metrics to ensure optimal
performance and resource utilization.

73
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:50,019
Cloud native authentication
and authorization.

74
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:51,999
Security is non-negotiable.

75
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:58,779
Kubernetes role-based access control or
RAC enables gran permissions defining

76
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:00,579
who can do what inside the cluster.

77
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:04,419
By automating service accounts
and enforcing lease privilege.

78
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:07,179
RAC enhances multi-tenant security.

79
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:13,829
Complementing this or 2.0 and
JWTs allow for secure stateless

80
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:19,049
authentication across APIs, integrating
with external identity providers

81
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,739
and simplifying API, key management
comprehensive observability stack.

82
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:26,149
You can't improve what you can't measure.

83
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:30,979
A complete observability stack
combining Prometheus for metrics,

84
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:36,949
grapha for dashboards, and giga or
zipkin for tracing, ensuring full

85
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:39,019
visibility across MI microservices.

86
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:43,489
This enables proactive monitoring,
root cause analysis, and data

87
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:44,899
driven scaling decisions.

88
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:47,739
DevOps is standardization with hen.

89
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:50,919
HEN charts are the package
managers of Kubernetes.

90
00:05:51,324 --> 00:05:55,404
Standardizing deployments and
enforcing configuration as code.

91
00:05:55,764 --> 00:05:59,814
They ensure consistency across
development, staging, and production.

92
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:04,184
Key benefits include reusability,
version control and dependency

93
00:06:04,184 --> 00:06:08,774
management, essential for a scaling
complex, microservice ecosystems,

94
00:06:09,274 --> 00:06:11,244
intelligent rate limiting and scale.

95
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:16,309
Adaptive rate limiting dynamically
throttles traffic based on

96
00:06:16,429 --> 00:06:19,339
resource availability and
downstream health, preventing

97
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:24,224
overloads paired with auto-scaling
integrations like HPA and VPA.

98
00:06:24,549 --> 00:06:29,019
You get intelligent scaling and
cost optimization across cloud

99
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:35,559
providers like AWS Azure and
G-C-P-A-P-I monetization strategies.

100
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:39,969
APIs are not just technical
assets, they are business products.

101
00:06:40,374 --> 00:06:46,404
Usage based pricing and analytics driven
insights help monetize APIs effectively.

102
00:06:47,394 --> 00:06:52,434
Namespace isolation supports multi-tenant
models while developers self service

103
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:57,584
portals improve discovery and adoption
developers self service capabilities,

104
00:06:57,794 --> 00:06:59,684
empowering developers is critical.

105
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:02,524
Kubernetes operators and
custom resource definitions

106
00:07:02,524 --> 00:07:04,029
enable self service management.

107
00:07:04,684 --> 00:07:08,974
Automating complex lifecycle operations
and embedding GI offs principles.

108
00:07:09,364 --> 00:07:13,804
This reduces operational overhead
and accelerates delivery cycles.

109
00:07:14,304 --> 00:07:15,624
Implementation framework.

110
00:07:15,924 --> 00:07:18,804
A successful rollout starts
with a clear framework.

111
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:20,454
Assessment and planning.

112
00:07:20,664 --> 00:07:22,464
Evaluate your current architecture.

113
00:07:22,884 --> 00:07:27,264
Second, deploy the service mesh is to
or linkerd with the right security.

114
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:32,264
Third, integrate your API Gateway, align
Traffic Management and Observability.

115
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:35,534
Finally optimize for production.

116
00:07:35,864 --> 00:07:36,224
Fine.

117
00:07:36,224 --> 00:07:38,384
Tune for performance and scale.

118
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:42,425
