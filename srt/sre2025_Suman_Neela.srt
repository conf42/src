00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:00,840
Hi.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,590
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:06,300
Today's topic, middleware driven
hybrid integration, bridging the Gap

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,010
in modern enterprise architecture.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,680
So the evolution of more middleware
driven hybrid integration has become

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,300
crucial in modern enterprise architecture,
bridging traditional on premises

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,490
system with cloud native solutions.

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,440
This transformation addresses the
growing of complexity of enterprise

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,190
system through sophisticated
integration patterns and framework.

10
00:00:30,224 --> 00:00:35,205
Organizations are increasingly adapting
the middleware solutions to enhance

11
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:40,695
operational efficiency, improve the
data synchronization, and also to

12
00:00:40,695 --> 00:00:45,795
maintain system reliability across
the diverse technological landscapes

13
00:00:46,515 --> 00:00:50,810
through service oriented architecture
and advanced integration patterns.

14
00:00:51,405 --> 00:00:56,115
Middleware solution facilitates seamless
communication between the legacy systems

15
00:00:56,115 --> 00:01:01,635
and the modern cloud platforms while
ensuring the data consistency and system

16
00:01:01,635 --> 00:01:04,965
performance as shown in the picture.

17
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:09,045
So middleware is going to
bridge the gap between cloud

18
00:01:09,045 --> 00:01:11,155
systems and on legacy systems.

19
00:01:11,545 --> 00:01:12,985
So let's get into the details.

20
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:19,045
So evaluation of enterprise
architecture, monolithic systems.

21
00:01:19,434 --> 00:01:23,964
Service oriented architecture, hybrid
integration distributor services.

22
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:28,344
These are the main concepts
of enterprise architecture.

23
00:01:28,794 --> 00:01:33,475
So when it comes to monolithic
systems, centralized self-contained

24
00:01:33,475 --> 00:01:38,199
applications with tightly integrated
functions, limited interoperability and

25
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,439
challenging scalability constraints.

26
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:44,604
So when it comes to service
oriented architecture, it is

27
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,344
business aligned services.

28
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,830
With standard interfaces enabling
modular development, reusability

29
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,260
and technology agnostic integration.

30
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:59,560
So hybrid integration orchestrated the
convergence of system with the cloud

31
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,960
systems and cloud platforms facilitating
synchronized data flows between

32
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,780
the consistent business operations.

33
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,220
And the next last concept, what
I, what is there in the enterprise

34
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,320
architecture is distributor services.

35
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,550
So decoupled microservices
architecture with an autonomous

36
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,860
deployment capabilities and resilient
infrastructure and dynamic scaling

37
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,740
to adapt evolving business demands.

38
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,380
So enterprise architecture has
evolved dramatically from rigid,

39
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,100
monolithic frameworks to agile
service oriented ecosystem.

40
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,260
This transformation response to
increasing business complexity and the

41
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,840
imperative for digital adaptability.

42
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,120
While optimizing organizational
performance, modern enterprises must

43
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,670
strategically balance their establish
technology investments with emerging cloud

44
00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:00,370
native capabilities to create the robust
future ready architectural foundations.

45
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,530
This evolution is going to be so much
useful in the enterprise architecture

46
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,390
using the middleware, how monolithic
service oriented hybrid integration

47
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,850
distributed services are being used.

48
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,290
So when it comes to the challenges,
the integration challenges

49
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,760
in the modern enterprises, so
complexity processing, realtime

50
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,130
processing, consistency in the data.

51
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,340
So these are the key FA key areas.

52
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:33,010
So 72% of the technology leaders
identify system integration as a critical

53
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,590
priority for digital transformation
initiatives, reflecting the growing

54
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,870
complexity of all IT landscapes
and real in real time processing.

55
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,940
65% of the organizations are actively
modern modernizing their integration

56
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,079
infrastructure to support real
time data processing capabilities.

57
00:03:53,545 --> 00:03:56,635
And also to handle
increasing data volumes.

58
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:02,845
So when it comes to data consistency,
maintaining the data consistently, and

59
00:04:02,845 --> 00:04:07,885
ensuring the timely information delivery
across the entire technology stacks from

60
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:13,765
legacy databases to modern cloud services
integration challenges extend beyond

61
00:04:13,765 --> 00:04:15,380
traditional point to point connection.

62
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:21,670
Encompassing complex data ecosystems
that must support various protocols

63
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,560
and processing requirements.

64
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,630
The middleware layer serves as
intelligent orchestration mechanism,

65
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,640
managing complex data transformations
while ensuring the security complaints

66
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,530
and maintaining the data consistency.

67
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:42,070
And when it comes to enterprise
architecture, component integration level.

68
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,390
So the levels are like legacy
system integration, cloud native

69
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:51,370
adoption service, re usability,
legacy system integration.

70
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:58,720
Integration levels have steadily
increased from 45% in 2022, 85% in

71
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,300
2024, demonstrating organization's
commitment to preserving valuable

72
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,505
legacy investments while modernizing
the architecture as well.

73
00:05:08,635 --> 00:05:15,265
And a as part of Cloud native adaption,
the most dramatic growth curve shows

74
00:05:15,265 --> 00:05:22,615
that cloud native adoption rising
from 30 to 85% over four period, and

75
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:26,845
reflecting the accelerating shift
towards modern deployment parity.

76
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:30,469
So service reusability is the main key.

77
00:05:30,845 --> 00:05:37,145
So service re reusability has improved
significantly from 25 to 80%, indicating

78
00:05:37,235 --> 00:05:41,855
greater architectural maturity and
more efficient resource utilization

79
00:05:41,855 --> 00:05:48,860
across the enterprise environments so

organizations to reduce the latency.

175
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:06,260
And also to improve the response times
for critical applications, particularly in

176
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,480
i, OT and real time processing scenarios.

177
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:14,330
Modern middleware solution must handle the
complexities of i ot, device management,

178
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,120
data processing and security requirements.

179
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,950
Also, implementation best
practices, thorough system

180
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:26,540
analysis, strategic tools selection,
robust monitoring, team training.

181
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,630
These are all like best
practices that we can implement.

182
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,000
Implementation, evaluate existing
systems under integration requirement,

183
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,420
and assess future scalability
needs Before implementation.

184
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,070
Choose solutions that align with
specific technical requirements while

185
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:48,800
considering scalability, security,
and monitoring capabilities, robust

186
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,580
monitoring, implementing comprehensive
logging and monitoring systems

187
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:57,170
to track performance and identify
potential issues and proactively.

188
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,240
Team training, develop comprehensive
training programs for technical

189
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,480
teams to ensure effective system
utilization and maintenance.

190
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,930
Successful middleware
implementation requests, careful

191
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,580
planning and strategic approach.

192
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,130
Organizations must conduct through
system analysis before implementation,

193
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:22,700
evaluating existing systems and
understanding integration requirement

194
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,425
to reduce the implementation risk.

195
00:14:25,145 --> 00:14:30,905
Middleware driven hybrid integration
stance has cornerstone of modern

196
00:14:30,905 --> 00:14:34,295
enterprise architecture enabling
organizations to synchronize

197
00:14:34,295 --> 00:14:37,895
and process data effectively
across the diverse systems.

198
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:42,605
Organizations that effectively leverage
these technologies, not only enhance

199
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:46,505
their operational capabilities,
but also establish a foundation

200
00:14:46,505 --> 00:14:48,755
for future technology advancement.

201
00:14:50,315 --> 00:14:51,440
So thank you very much.

202
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:58,210
