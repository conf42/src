1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,470
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,550
I am Dave back, and welcome to my talk.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,670
Today I will discuss about how
AI is transforming healthcare

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:17,369
claim adjudication, an area that's
historically been bogged down

5
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:24,390
by lots of manual processes and
inefficiencies that leads to rising cost.

6
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:31,075
We will explore how AI technologies
enable faster, smarter, and

7
00:00:31,075 --> 00:00:33,415
more accurate claim processing.

8
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:39,865
While also helping reduce fraud
and improve overall satisfaction

9
00:00:39,865 --> 00:00:42,685
for the providers and members.

10
00:00:42,865 --> 00:00:44,125
So let's get started.

11
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:51,255
So those who are familiar with the United
States Healthcare System, they know us.

12
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:54,095
Healthcare spendings a lot.

13
00:00:54,615 --> 00:01:00,615
To put it into prospective, last
year in the year of 2024, US spent

14
00:01:00,615 --> 00:01:03,675
like approximately $4.9 trillion.

15
00:01:04,095 --> 00:01:08,115
That's roughly 17.6
percentage of nation GDP.

16
00:01:08,145 --> 00:01:09,015
And that's a lot.

17
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:15,705
And when that, there's a wastage happen
on that close to $5 trillion, even a tiny

18
00:01:15,705 --> 00:01:19,535
percentage seems a lot to give some stats.

19
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,790
On that roughly 30
percentage of the claims.

20
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,970
In, in all the insurance companies
together, they do manual processing and

21
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:35,145
that means real human efforts for every
third of a claim, and that's a lot.

22
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:40,985
Administrative costs in US healthcare
is roughly three $50 billion annually.

23
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:47,730
It's a massive chunk of it goes into
processing and reprocessing claims.

24
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:53,260
The average claim cycles is
about 45 days from submission

25
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,240
to payment to the providers.

26
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:02,600
And there is also roughly 7.5 percentage
error rate, which can lead to denials,

27
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,030
resubmission and provider members.

28
00:02:06,235 --> 00:02:07,705
Frustration of course.

29
00:02:07,735 --> 00:02:12,745
So as you can see, this entire
process needs a lot of disruption

30
00:02:13,025 --> 00:02:18,485
because claim processing takes a
lot of spending in various aspect,

31
00:02:18,695 --> 00:02:21,425
and also that involves fraud.

32
00:02:21,755 --> 00:02:28,145
So we have to see how AI can
help this entire workflow.

33
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:35,845
So to, to get to get started, we have to
see how AI is stepping in to improve this.

34
00:02:36,124 --> 00:02:37,504
There are multiple ways.

35
00:02:37,664 --> 00:02:43,724
The first would be the automation through
RPA, which is robotic process automation.

36
00:02:44,089 --> 00:02:48,689
That helps process routine
claims which are rule based,

37
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:51,359
repetitive and has a pattern logic.

38
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:55,409
Definitely takes away a lot
of manual efforts out of it.

39
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,499
And the next one would be the,
some kind of an intelligence.

40
00:02:59,944 --> 00:03:06,954
No, via machine learning ai that can
identify patterns, detect anomalies,

41
00:03:07,194 --> 00:03:12,994
and even learn from its own adjudication
outcome so it can get better.

42
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,404
And another one is.

43
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:16,654
Going to be through some NLP.

44
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:21,704
That plays a significant role by
extracting structured data from

45
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:24,564
unstructured clinical nodes and documents.

46
00:03:24,564 --> 00:03:29,124
Because healthcare system is full
of different entities, each of

47
00:03:29,124 --> 00:03:31,914
them maintains their own system.

48
00:03:32,064 --> 00:03:35,004
So there is a potential for.

49
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:38,029
Lot of unstructured data.

50
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:41,389
So NLP can help to make them structured.

51
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:46,779
So some kind of an intelligence
can help to process those, make the

52
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,554
process more efficient and faster.

53
00:03:49,054 --> 00:03:53,774
And finally it's gonna be the
validation through some AI based

54
00:03:53,774 --> 00:04:00,689
ruling gene that can dynamically apply
peer policies to, to incoming claims

55
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:03,509
so that the policy check intact.

56
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,859
And we know whatever intelligence
is applied, it's being validated

57
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:08,999
and thoroughly checked.

58
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,319
So going from here what does all do?

59
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:15,489
We implement all of
these what it can help.

60
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:19,179
So the first is going to
be the faster processing.

61
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:19,809
Of course.

62
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:24,049
It's definitely gonna be faster
than manually adjudicating millions

63
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:26,299
of claims some organization have.

64
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:33,699
Noticed that it reduced adjudication time
up to 75 percentage, and that's a lot.

65
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:37,349
It also comes with accuracy improvements.

66
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:43,159
Error rates can drop up to 80 percentage,
which means fewer claim denials and

67
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:45,779
fewer appeals either from members.

68
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:47,289
Other providers.

69
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:52,119
This also leads to a 30 to 40%
reduction in operation cost.

70
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:58,399
So that means fewer people, fewer
correction, more claim process per day.

71
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:01,789
So the efficiency definitely increase.

72
00:05:02,059 --> 00:05:03,729
And of course the last.

73
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:07,159
Not the least is most important
is everyone is happier

74
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:09,109
when things process faster.

75
00:05:09,299 --> 00:05:15,119
Provider get providers get paid
faster and the members experience

76
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,369
fewer delays and the complaints.

77
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:22,409
So overall the system gets
more efficient, streamlined.

78
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:26,194
And smarter, so everybody
gets benefit out of it.

79
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:31,154
Now, if we look into some case
studies, there are a few there are

80
00:05:31,154 --> 00:05:37,424
a few insurance companies that the
insurers now or the peer, they have

81
00:05:37,524 --> 00:05:40,074
tried various AI stack in their.

82
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:47,169
Claim adjudication, workflow and and
observed many significant results in us.

83
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:48,969
There are many insurers.

84
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:51,869
Some of them are highlighted
in the case studies.

85
00:05:52,049 --> 00:05:54,269
One of, one of the example involved.

86
00:05:54,374 --> 00:05:58,694
Implementing machine learning for
complex claim types like specialty

87
00:05:58,694 --> 00:06:03,874
pharmacy claims that needs a special
type of approval authorization

88
00:06:03,934 --> 00:06:07,994
approvals and processing those claim
because it's a very high dollar claim.

89
00:06:08,474 --> 00:06:13,314
Auto adjudication as a result of
implementing AI improve almost 80

90
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:19,284
percentage resulting in millions of dollar
in annual savings and higher provider.

91
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:20,529
Satisfaction.

92
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:26,799
Another peer adopted NLP to analyze
clinical document documentation in

93
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:32,059
real time which led to a 65 percentage
reduction in processing time and

94
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:35,119
significantly improved fraud detection.

95
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:41,019
And last one is a robotic process
automation helped increase monthly

96
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:44,389
claim capacity by 1.5 million claims.

97
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:45,199
And that's a lot.

98
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:49,979
Because oftentimes we get a lot of
claims based on a commercial health plan.

99
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:54,149
And you have to process them on
time so that you don't get delay

100
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:56,939
on provider payment, otherwise
you have to pay interest.

101
00:06:57,329 --> 00:07:01,909
So if we apply some kind of RPA
stack in the claim processing

102
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:04,059
workflow, it definitely helps.

103
00:07:04,404 --> 00:07:10,164
And it makes things faster and oftentimes
accuracy also increase than your

104
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:14,784
manual trim processing because whenever
there's a manual process involved, that

105
00:07:14,784 --> 00:07:16,844
oftentimes leads to a manual error.

106
00:07:17,344 --> 00:07:17,944
Now.

107
00:07:18,214 --> 00:07:23,294
Now let's talk about the fraud
detection because it's also one of the

108
00:07:23,294 --> 00:07:29,854
important part of claim education now
how it can help specifically how AI

109
00:07:29,854 --> 00:07:34,504
can help to detect the frauds and be
compliant with your compliance like

110
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:37,274
hipaa and other healthcare compliances.

111
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:41,574
So the first one, it can spot
unusual behavior in the billing.

112
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:46,904
That comes in the regular claim files
whether it's medical claims other

113
00:07:46,904 --> 00:07:52,184
hospital claims like UBO four or CMS
1500, no matter what type of claim it is.

114
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:54,074
In your EDI gateway.

115
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:59,874
You can filter it through all this
unusual behavior and the AI can also

116
00:07:59,874 --> 00:08:03,994
check the historical pattern from the
same providers or the across various

117
00:08:03,994 --> 00:08:10,934
providers to match it up and map all these
animals to detect the unusual relationship

118
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,704
with the claim and the providers.

119
00:08:12,764 --> 00:08:15,290
That certainly helps
with the claim volumes.

120
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:21,405
And the second one is, can automate the
alert system, some kind of a suspicious

121
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:26,085
claims on the very early on, on the
claim adjudication cycle before even it

122
00:08:26,085 --> 00:08:28,495
goes for a full adjudication routine.

123
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:33,060
So that oftentimes reduce
the system load and more of a

124
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:35,505
detection at the very early on.

125
00:08:35,785 --> 00:08:39,455
So overall fraud detection
accuracy can improve as much as.

126
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:45,660
60 percentage with AI compared
to traditional rule-based system.

127
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,360
So now moving on the
implementation roadmap.

128
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:56,270
So if you as a healthcare
insurer wants to implement AI in

129
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,700
your daily claim adjudication.

130
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,220
Workflow, how do you do that?

131
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,260
So there are multi-step process.

132
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:08,930
So the first one is definitely going
to be the assessment, understanding

133
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:15,170
your current workflows, identifying
the highest impact area for automation,

134
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,660
because that's gonna be your main focus.

135
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:23,970
And then from there on, you pilot you
pilot your assessment into a pilot

136
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,135
program targeting few set of claims.

137
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:31,205
See how your AI model results
and validate those results.

138
00:09:31,475 --> 00:09:36,995
And if your validation comes
through positive, you can expand

139
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:39,725
this to a large number of claims.

140
00:09:39,725 --> 00:09:43,295
So basically you scale the solution
across more claims categories.

141
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:44,555
And finally, once that is.

142
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:48,295
Stern, you can integrate everything
into your core architecture

143
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:49,975
for seamless operation.

144
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:54,875
That's that way you can eventually
get the benefits of the AI

145
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,605
implementation in your claims stack.

146
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,490
Now what's next?

147
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:05,020
Now the next is very in
terms of AI is very bright.

148
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:10,090
A lot of industries are definitely
implementing ai, healthcare of time

149
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,850
lags because we have to comply with
lot of regulation, compliance and

150
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,095
government and stuff like that.

151
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:21,675
But it has many things that
we can certainly incorporate.

152
00:10:21,735 --> 00:10:27,045
The things that it can go is towards
the self-learning AI models, meaning

153
00:10:27,285 --> 00:10:31,665
they just don't follow the rules,
but they also continuously adapt.

154
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:34,830
I. To new types of claims
and improve themselves.

155
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:41,030
The timeframe might vary, but I am looking
to see next three to five years, we will

156
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:46,500
have like tremendous amount of growth
on that area where when the AI models.

157
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:52,015
Are more matured handling
privacy handling healthcare data.

158
00:10:52,595 --> 00:10:57,005
Then we can also include the
blockchain validation that is also

159
00:10:57,005 --> 00:11:00,425
gaining a lot of traction because
it's transparency and immutability.

160
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:05,315
So you can basically verify on a open
ledger and potentially reducing the

161
00:11:05,315 --> 00:11:10,075
disputes and enabling the smart contract
based adjudication routine, and and the

162
00:11:10,075 --> 00:11:14,905
last one we will also see a lot of these
probably is not already happening is that

163
00:11:15,295 --> 00:11:22,580
AI and the and the human kind of an hybrid
system where AI handles all the bulk of

164
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:28,430
decision ma making map decision making,
that's a more rule-based repetitive.

165
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:33,890
And then you have your human experts
that focuses on the more complex logic.

166
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:39,090
Now the challenges and the consideration
that we need to look, even though we

167
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:44,880
are so excited about having AI into our
workflow, not just healthcare for any

168
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,990
industry, every industry specifically
healthcare comes with a lot of challenges.

169
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,615
The one that I have already mentioned.

170
00:11:52,315 --> 00:11:57,175
There are many entities in healthcare
industry and everybody follows their own

171
00:11:57,205 --> 00:12:00,305
data, streamline various data structures.

172
00:12:00,515 --> 00:12:06,285
So data quality is one of the
biggest that it has to overcome.

173
00:12:06,285 --> 00:12:10,895
So AI always work with some kind
of a input data that is clean,

174
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:12,755
consistent, and standardized.

175
00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:14,225
So if it is.

176
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:19,600
Not that, then it'll definitely
has lot of room to improvement.

177
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,930
So we have to focus on that, and
that's, right now it's a challenge.

178
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,410
Second one is going to
be regulatory compliance.

179
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,080
That rightly because healthcare is a very.

180
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,260
Privacy focused sector where
information about the member

181
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,970
and the provider has to be kept.

182
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:41,010
Private and regulatory involvement
from the government is very important.

183
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:47,940
So we cannot just let any ai to
to handle those data without any

184
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,800
following rules and guidelines.

185
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,090
So that's very important.

186
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,005
And we also.

187
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:57,600
Have to be careful when we implement the
staff training and change management.

188
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,430
AI changes, oftentimes job roles, and that
transition must be done very thoughtfully.

189
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,240
And finally, the ethical
implementation is very critical

190
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,760
because algorithms must be transparent.

191
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,180
Explainable and free from bias.

192
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,720
Bias is very important because it
oftentimes can take any decision

193
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,270
that may go wrong, specifically when
it comes to the healthcare system.

194
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,160
Now comes to the ROI
and the business case.

195
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,230
Now, at this point of time, it's quite
evident that eventually every business

196
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,060
will implement some sort of an ai.

197
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:37,860
Healthcare is not prone to that,
not immune to that implementation.

198
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,640
But at the same time, there is
a clear case of of good ROI like

199
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,200
the business case is very strong.

200
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,840
Most organizations see ROI within.

201
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:54,140
12 to 18 months when it is implemented
fully, and productivity also increases.

202
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,800
There's a cost saving there,
there's a reduction in error.

203
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:03,700
And when we give enough time from the
full implementation till three years,

204
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:10,150
fast forward, as you can see on my
screen, the maximum potential is achieved.

205
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,950
And that's where.

206
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:17,005
Things started to get compound when we
scaled the solution in a large scale.

207
00:14:17,185 --> 00:14:22,555
When you process millions of claims
on a regular basis and you start

208
00:14:22,555 --> 00:14:25,135
to see your ROI and other metrics.

209
00:14:25,635 --> 00:14:31,965
Now moving on, what's the next step and
the resources now, if you are considering,

210
00:14:32,055 --> 00:14:37,135
in stepping into this journey where you
wanted to plug in different AI stack

211
00:14:37,135 --> 00:14:42,445
into your claim adjudication workflow,
the first step is, would be to have

212
00:14:42,445 --> 00:14:47,735
some kind of an implementation guide or
some sort of a playbook in your roadmap.

213
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:54,370
Any possible schedule a consultation
to assist readiness to some experts who

214
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:59,930
are who are expert in the field or who
have already done it, and if not, attend

215
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:05,830
some kind of a workshop training session
to upscale your team and then possibly.

216
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:11,835
Leverage some kind of an ROI tool that
can give you a prediction of how much

217
00:15:11,835 --> 00:15:15,785
savings you can do if you implement
some kind of an potential some kind

218
00:15:15,785 --> 00:15:17,795
of an AI stack into your workflow.

219
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:22,775
But no matter what, the transformation
doesn't happen overnight.

220
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:26,685
But with the right strategy,
it can absolutely be achieved.

221
00:15:26,835 --> 00:15:28,155
So keep that in mind.

222
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,460
Whenever you implement this going
forward in any of your health plan.

223
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,110
Now, with that, I would conclude my
talk and I would like to thank you.

224
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,790
So thank you for tuning in.

225
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:46,560
This is give valuable insight about
how AI izing healthcare adjudication

226
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,000
system and if you'd like to explore
more further, feel free to contact me.

227
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,570
I would love to continue have
this conver conversation.

228
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:55,350
Thank you so much.
