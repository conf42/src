1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,160
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,980
Firstly I would like to thank.

3
00:00:03,025 --> 00:00:07,574
Thank queue for this opportunity
to present my research on LLM

4
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:11,925
powered self-auditing frameworks
for healthcare data pipelines.

5
00:00:12,735 --> 00:00:17,654
So this presentation will share how
fundamental breakthrough in healthcare

6
00:00:17,654 --> 00:00:24,854
data quality assurance has been achieved
using LLMs with novel prompting strategies

7
00:00:24,854 --> 00:00:31,274
that represent a paradigm shift from
traditional auditing approaches.

8
00:00:31,774 --> 00:00:35,995
So coming to the problem I would like
to discuss about the problem first.

9
00:00:36,094 --> 00:00:42,004
So currently healthcare organizations
manage incredibly complex data ecosystems

10
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:47,404
like modern healthcare institutions
process millions and billions of.

11
00:00:47,854 --> 00:00:54,245
EHR electronic health records lab
results imaging studies prescriptive

12
00:00:54,305 --> 00:01:00,305
data and admin data through intricate
webof interconnected systems

13
00:01:00,305 --> 00:01:02,255
like Epic, Cerner, and so on.

14
00:01:02,755 --> 00:01:08,435
As these systems grow in complexity
maintaining data pipeline integrity

15
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:11,375
has emerged as a critical challenge.

16
00:01:11,475 --> 00:01:17,904
The consequences extend far beyond
technical inconveniences data

17
00:01:17,904 --> 00:01:23,474
pipeline inconsistencies can directly
affect patient safety treatment

18
00:01:23,474 --> 00:01:26,354
efficacy, and regulatory compliance.

19
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:33,434
So current research shows that
manual audits examine only 35%

20
00:01:33,434 --> 00:01:38,734
of trans transformational logic
while manual methods detect

21
00:01:38,794 --> 00:01:45,005
merely like 52% of known pipeline
issues in controlled environments.

22
00:01:45,785 --> 00:01:51,835
This represents a substantial gap that
this LLM based framework addresses.

23
00:01:52,335 --> 00:01:56,774
Coming to current limitations
we discussed about the problem.

24
00:01:56,774 --> 00:02:00,164
And also I would like to highlight
about the current limitations.

25
00:02:00,884 --> 00:02:05,964
So traditional auditing approaches
face significant limitations.

26
00:02:06,014 --> 00:02:11,834
Manual reviews are incredibly labor
intensive, requiring specialized

27
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:14,109
expertise spanning clinical.

28
00:02:15,104 --> 00:02:19,764
Knowledge database architecture
and statistical analysis.

29
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:25,394
So they typically examine only a fraction
of the total data transformations.

30
00:02:25,974 --> 00:02:31,644
And rule-based verification systems
offer greatly greater scalability,

31
00:02:31,644 --> 00:02:37,174
but focus primarily on structural
and syntactic validations rather

32
00:02:37,174 --> 00:02:39,904
than complex semantic relationships.

33
00:02:40,024 --> 00:02:42,884
Or clinical appropriateness.

34
00:02:43,384 --> 00:02:48,484
So most critically, these methods
consistently fail to detect logical

35
00:02:48,484 --> 00:02:53,254
inconsistencies related to clinical
guidelines and business rules.

36
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:54,604
Precisely.

37
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:59,019
This is where the highest risk errors
occur in the healthcare settings.

38
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,349
Now since we have discussed about the
problem and the re limitations, now I

39
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:07,079
want to highlight the solution part.

40
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:13,139
So this LLM powered framework
addresses these limitations through

41
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:19,049
sophisticated prompt engineering that
enables expert level semantic analysis.

42
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:24,209
The core innovation is a hierarchical
prompting strategy combined with

43
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,339
a chain of thought reasoning
workflows that systematically

44
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:35,319
decompose complex healthcare auditing
tasks while maintaining awareness

45
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,959
of cross domain dependencies.

46
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:45,889
The methodology achieved a 42% improvement
in error detection sensitivity, and a 35.

47
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:52,569
Percent reduction in false positive rates
compared to standard prompting approaches

48
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:58,719
with along with this, there is a
remarkable 58% growth in detecting complex

49
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,209
multi condition clinical protocols.

50
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:06,059
Now I would like to talk about
the framework architecture.

51
00:04:06,249 --> 00:04:10,209
So this framework implements a
multi-layered architecture with

52
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,729
five integrated components.

53
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:18,119
So the data extract layer interfaces
with existing healthcare systems

54
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:21,899
using read-only connections
and API based interactions.

55
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:28,589
The Prompt Generation engine formulates
contextually appropriate instructions,

56
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:33,854
incorporating clinical guidelines
historical data patterns, and

57
00:04:34,514 --> 00:04:37,274
organization specific business rules.

58
00:04:38,124 --> 00:04:44,034
The LLM orchestration service manages
model interactions and response

59
00:04:44,124 --> 00:04:49,804
parsing the analysis, interpret
interpretation module, and translates

60
00:04:49,924 --> 00:04:56,494
LLM outputs into actionable insights
while the audit management system

61
00:04:56,494 --> 00:05:00,974
tracks findings, recommendations,
and remediation activities.

62
00:05:01,474 --> 00:05:07,954
This comprehensive architecture processed
substantially more distinct data

63
00:05:07,954 --> 00:05:13,944
transformations per pipeline compared to
the traditional sampling based approaches.

64
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:16,664
So that's about the architecture.

65
00:05:16,874 --> 00:05:19,844
Now I would like to highlight
the prompting strategy.

66
00:05:20,344 --> 00:05:25,794
So there is a three tier prompting
hierarchy represents a significant

67
00:05:25,794 --> 00:05:27,825
methodological advancement.

68
00:05:28,554 --> 00:05:34,044
Structural prompts guide the LLM to
analyze syntactic and architectural.

69
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:41,109
Elements like SQLs and taxes,
validation, ETL, pipeline connectivity

70
00:05:41,109 --> 00:05:44,199
and data type, consistencies and so on.

71
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:49,869
And semantic prompts focus on clinical
appropriateness, like guideline adherence

72
00:05:49,869 --> 00:05:56,079
verification, temporal logic validation,
and cross domain consistency checking.

73
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:02,709
So the comparative prompts evaluate
consistency between components

74
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:07,059
through version comparison and
cross system reconciliation.

75
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:12,279
The chain of thought technique
enables structure reasoning that

76
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:16,899
mirrors expert analysis patterns
significantly improving complex

77
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:19,714
logical inconsistency de detection.

78
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,849
That's about the prompting strategy.

79
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:27,309
Now I would like to discuss about
the results implementation results.

80
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:32,959
So the quantitative results demonstrate
transformative improvements.

81
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:38,279
The trans, the fa, the framework
achieved, and 87% detection rate

82
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:43,829
compared to 52% for manual methods,
which is like a 67 person improvement.

83
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:49,499
And also 63% for role-based
systems, which is like a 30.

84
00:06:50,084 --> 00:06:52,274
38% enhancement.

85
00:06:53,144 --> 00:07:01,724
The resource requirements decreased
by 70%, like from 2,400 to 720% hours

86
00:07:01,724 --> 00:07:09,284
annually, while simultaneously increasing
pipeline coverage from 35% to 92%.

87
00:07:09,944 --> 00:07:15,954
So this represents four 85% compound
efficiency gain economically

88
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:18,314
organizations achieve around like.

89
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:26,299
$340,000 in annual savings with
a 4.4 month ROI payback period

90
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:31,289
which by delivering a two 72%
annual return on investment.

91
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:32,479
And.

92
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:36,849
There are some case study highlights
that I would like to discuss.

93
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:41,109
So the implementation across multiple
healthcare organizations revealed

94
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:47,469
the frameworks real world impact at
Northeast Regional Health System.

95
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:48,819
The audit discovered.

96
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:54,419
Incomplete medication reconciliation
logic affecting patient safety alerts.

97
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:59,139
Which is a critical issue that
had evaded routine manual reviews.

98
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:05,830
Western academic medical centers
sepsis bundle compliance dashboard

99
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:10,680
contained discrepancies between
documented specifications

100
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,570
and implemented calculations.

101
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:18,529
And the Southern Community Health
Network had outdated heart failure

102
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:25,809
protocols that did not reflect latest
a HA or a CC guideline updates.

103
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:31,075
So these findings demonstrate the
frameworks ability to identify high

104
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:36,714
impact issues across diverse healthcare
environments that I just mentioned.

105
00:08:37,214 --> 00:08:41,134
Coming to the comparative analysis
performance comparisons reveal

106
00:08:41,264 --> 00:08:46,604
superior effectiveness across all
categories for complex logic detection.

107
00:08:46,604 --> 00:08:53,944
The framework achieved 94% accuracy
compared to 34% for manual auditing,

108
00:08:54,454 --> 00:09:00,614
and 41% for rule-based approaches
which is like a 176 percentage

109
00:09:00,644 --> 00:09:02,714
improvement over manual methods.

110
00:09:03,214 --> 00:09:04,264
Perhaps Bo.

111
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:11,405
Most importantly, guideline update lag
decreased from 47 days for rule-based

112
00:09:11,405 --> 00:09:18,094
systems to just two days for this
framework, which is like a 96% reduction,

113
00:09:18,094 --> 00:09:23,974
that prevents an estimated five 40
days of cumulative exposure to outdated

114
00:09:23,974 --> 00:09:26,374
protocols per organization annually.

115
00:09:26,874 --> 00:09:29,509
So that's about the comparative analysis.

116
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:34,349
And there are some ethical
considerations and integration.

117
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:38,880
Responsible implementation requires
thoughtful govern governance.

118
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,850
The research developed an ethical
framework comprising human oversight

119
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:51,079
with clear responsibility delineation
transparency in model limitations,

120
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:55,969
equity and pipeline coverage,
and robust privacy protections.

121
00:09:56,469 --> 00:10:02,170
Privacy impact assessments demonstrated
full HIPAA compliance with no

122
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,689
protected health information exposure.

123
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:11,239
Integrated strategies focused on
enabling within CICD pipelines

124
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:16,749
for automated audits and alignment
with existing governance committees

125
00:10:17,229 --> 00:10:22,099
achieving positive return of investment
most quickly with the CICD approach.

126
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:27,099
So now I want to talk about
the future directions.

127
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:32,489
So the future research directions
expand capabilities in several areas

128
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:36,659
like realtime monitoring through
streaming, streaming architectures,

129
00:10:37,349 --> 00:10:41,639
which enables continuous validation
rather than periodic assessment.

130
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:46,774
And domain specific fine tuning
using healthcare specific data

131
00:10:46,804 --> 00:10:50,714
sets shows, promise for further
performance improvements.

132
00:10:51,614 --> 00:10:56,864
The research also explores shift left
approaches that identify potential

133
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:03,344
is issues during design phases rather
than like post implementation stage.

134
00:11:03,844 --> 00:11:10,034
These advances position the framework
for broader application beyond healthcare

135
00:11:10,064 --> 00:11:15,194
to other regulated industries as well,
requiring rigorous data governance.

136
00:11:16,014 --> 00:11:19,824
So we can use the same framework
for other industries as well.

137
00:11:19,824 --> 00:11:22,844
Not, yeah, that's that's
the future direction.

138
00:11:23,344 --> 00:11:26,249
So finally, in conclusion this LLM.

139
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:31,579
Auditing framework represents a paradigm
shift in healthcare data governance.

140
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:37,819
The four 85% compound efficiency
gains exceed typical healthcare id

141
00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:45,449
project improvements of 15 to 25%
performance, places the framework

142
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:50,229
and top 5% of the healthcare data
quality tools and also beyond.

143
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:56,669
Immediate benefits implementation
catalyzes broader organizational

144
00:11:56,669 --> 00:12:03,289
changes, which increased cross-functional
collaboration, improved documentation

145
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:07,049
quality, and cultural shifts toward.

146
00:12:07,554 --> 00:12:12,984
Continuous quality improvement and
this methodology enables healthcare

147
00:12:12,984 --> 00:12:18,804
organizations to ensure data
integrity at a scale and consistency

148
00:12:19,374 --> 00:12:21,654
impossible with traditional.

149
00:12:22,254 --> 00:12:26,514
Approaches directly supporting
better patient outcomes

150
00:12:26,514 --> 00:12:28,254
and operational excellence.

151
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,474
Yeah, that's about it.

152
00:12:30,524 --> 00:12:36,034
Thank you so much for your attention
and questions about this research

153
00:12:36,034 --> 00:12:41,704
and its implications for healthcare
data governance are welcome.

154
00:12:41,884 --> 00:12:42,919
Yeah, thank you so much.
