00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,280
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:02,780
My name Isman Carla.

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,290
I'm a senior technical lead and
a cloud DevOps engineer with

4
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:07,819
seven years of work experience.

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,129
Thank you all for joining my talk.

6
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,180
Today we'll explore how AI is
transforming how we build and deploy

7
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,830
the software from the collaboration
world of DevOps to the future of no ops.

8
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,810
Initially we'll talk about
how DevOps is evolved and how

9
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,400
we are transforming to NoOps.

10
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,820
Initially we started the DevOps to
remove the gaps between development

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:34,585
and operation team so that we can
accelerate the deployments from lower

12
00:00:34,585 --> 00:00:37,135
environments to higher environments.

13
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:43,335
There are automation tools that improve
efficiency, but human oversight remains

14
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:48,925
crucial in each step from continuous
integration through continuous deployment.

15
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:54,755
However with the rise of no ops we
are fully envisioning automation

16
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:57,555
with the minimum human interactions.

17
00:00:58,065 --> 00:01:00,825
The primary reason behind
this transformation is

18
00:01:00,825 --> 00:01:02,955
because of a and MI models.

19
00:01:02,955 --> 00:01:07,460
R. Driving this huge transformation
in the world of DevOps.

20
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,789
Now we'll talk about how AI is
playing a crucial role in DevOps

21
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:17,229
automation, AI powered continuous
integration and continuous deployment.

22
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:21,880
Pipelines are built so that we
can deploy the application with a

23
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,950
minimal human input and interaction.

24
00:01:25,495 --> 00:01:30,344
This also helps us to find anomaly
detection and also root cause analysis

25
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:32,294
using machine learning algorithms.

26
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:36,674
And also it offers a self-healing
system that detects and

27
00:01:36,674 --> 00:01:38,504
fixes issues automatically.

28
00:01:39,004 --> 00:01:45,244
Also, a ops, our real time operational
insights and alerts that helps us to

29
00:01:45,244 --> 00:01:50,714
give more information about an issue that
is happening in various environments.

30
00:01:51,464 --> 00:01:55,604
This helps us to resolve the
issues quickly and also to get the

31
00:01:55,604 --> 00:01:58,814
application up with a minimal time.

32
00:01:59,314 --> 00:02:04,984
And also a driven infrastructure
management a has becoming smarter in

33
00:02:04,984 --> 00:02:10,124
terms of provisioning infrastructure,
for example if an infrastructure requires

34
00:02:10,184 --> 00:02:16,694
an order, scaling it predictive analysis
helps us whether to up the application or

35
00:02:16,694 --> 00:02:19,154
down the application based on the traffic.

36
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:23,204
And also AI is helping us to
manage Kubernetes clusters

37
00:02:23,574 --> 00:02:25,494
with a minimal human inputs.

38
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:30,784
This helps us to minimize the cost
and also improve the performance.

39
00:02:31,064 --> 00:02:33,914
In the long run, AI is helping.

40
00:02:34,414 --> 00:02:39,994
In terms of infrastructure as a code with
intelligent valuation, this says that

41
00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:45,714
while improving the code AI is helping
us so that we can focus more on the

42
00:02:45,714 --> 00:02:52,584
problem rather than syntax, for example,
Datadog, which helps us to visualize.

43
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:58,784
The information from the clusters
and also it also helps us to

44
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:03,934
understand how the infrastructure
is behaving and also application

45
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:08,784
metrics, infrastructure metrics,
and also the usage of the resources.

46
00:03:09,284 --> 00:03:13,974
Now when coming to challenges and
risks of New Ops, there are quite

47
00:03:13,974 --> 00:03:19,724
number of challenges while implementing
the new ops because A requires a

48
00:03:19,754 --> 00:03:22,634
high quality data and data tuning.

49
00:03:23,174 --> 00:03:30,139
If we rely completely on automation that
might miss root causes for many problems.

50
00:03:30,619 --> 00:03:33,949
And also security
concerns are the biggest.

51
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:39,479
Discussion because developers cannot
have the expertise in security in

52
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:41,879
finding anomalies and fixing them.

53
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:48,149
Even the automation tools have the
vulnerabilities so that it might cause

54
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:51,479
security threat to, or it operations.

55
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:54,409
This is not just about shifting to tools.

56
00:03:54,649 --> 00:03:58,049
It's just more about software
development lifecycle.

57
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:01,294
Also the future of AI in DevOps.

58
00:04:01,894 --> 00:04:06,774
This has become really efficient
in generating a code and

59
00:04:06,774 --> 00:04:08,944
also configuration changes.

60
00:04:09,274 --> 00:04:13,684
For example, GitHub Coate helps us
to generate Kubernetes configuration

61
00:04:13,684 --> 00:04:16,744
files based on our prompt eight.

62
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:23,329
Reach all the code in our repos and
generate a particular required AML file,

63
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,999
and then it deploys into the production.

64
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:33,279
Also hybrid model helps us combining
human oversight with AI automation in

65
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:40,299
the future DevOps engineers transitioning
into mostly a supervisors and strategies.

66
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:47,609
This is a visual representation of a
driven evolution in cloud operations.

67
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:52,419
If you see we initially started with
manual interventions with scripted

68
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:55,149
automations and DevOps collaborations.

69
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:59,609
With the time we moved to a
driven continuous integration

70
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:03,669
and continuous deployment anomaly
detection and also health self.

71
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:09,179
Healing systems also in smart
infrastructure based on the predict

72
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:14,649
analysis, autoscaling can be
take place based on traffic that

73
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:18,259
improvises cost as well as efficiency.

74
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:24,409
In the second and challenges and the
ethics is more about data quality, AI

75
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:30,709
transparency, role and transformation
now the future and no ops, which

76
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:32,869
we'll discuss in the next slide.

77
00:05:33,369 --> 00:05:39,339
So now real question is that can
AI truly replace human operations?

78
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:41,499
The answer is not yet.

79
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:47,419
The rise of NoOps doesn't end the
signal of DevOps because DevOps can

80
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:52,999
be used for a more strategic and
complex problems, whereas NoOps can be

81
00:05:52,999 --> 00:06:00,199
used for a simple, automating tasks,
full ops is still aspirational, but

82
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,289
human oversights remain critical.

83
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:06,669
DevOps is still evolving,
but not disappearing.

84
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:13,659
However, with AI as a co-pilot, we can
generate more sustainable and stable

85
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:16,354
application across all environments.

86
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:21,379
This is all about DevOps to
NoOps can a automate everything.

87
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:27,304
Thank you all for joining my talk
and I hope you all enjoy con 42 Site

88
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,504
Reliability Engineering Conference.

89
00:06:29,954 --> 00:06:30,384
Thank you.
