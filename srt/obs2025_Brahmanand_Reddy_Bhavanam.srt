00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,370
Good evening everyone.

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:06,219
I'm Bra Haredi Ham, a developer with
the Department of Veterans Office.

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,910
Today I'm excited to share
how advanced Observability is

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,680
transforming healthcare IT system.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,750
In the next 15 minutes, we'll explore
why observability is the backbone

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,800
of resilient distributed healthcare
systems, diving into challenges,

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,930
solutions, and real world impacts.

8
00:00:22,665 --> 00:00:23,654
Let's get started.

9
00:00:24,154 --> 00:00:28,865
Healthcare depends on complex,
interconnected IT systems, but 73% of

10
00:00:28,865 --> 00:00:33,845
the organization lack comprehensive
visibility into these distributed systems.

11
00:00:34,385 --> 00:00:38,435
These visibility gaps can lead to
delays or disruptions in patient care.

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,489
For example this chart shows how
73% of healthcare organizations

13
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,109
struggle with the system.

14
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:46,739
Blind sport

15
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:51,049
Advanced Observative framework
address this by reducing the

16
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:54,109
meantime of the resolution by 84%.

17
00:00:54,529 --> 00:00:59,689
This means issues are identified and
fixed faster, minimizing patient impact.

18
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:00,739
Additionally.

19
00:01:01,504 --> 00:01:05,074
Integrated distributed tracing
with the clinical workflow, cut

20
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:10,744
troubleshooting time by 67%, allowing
IT teams to focus on proactive care.

21
00:01:11,315 --> 00:01:15,745
This graph highlights the
dramatic drop in resolution time.

22
00:01:16,525 --> 00:01:19,705
Let's compare traditional monitoring
with the advanced observability

23
00:01:20,305 --> 00:01:22,315
and see why this shift is critical.

24
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:27,465
Traditional monitoring in healthcare
often relies on basic system level

25
00:01:27,465 --> 00:01:31,035
metrics like CP usage without context.

26
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:36,915
This leads to fragmented visibility,
reactive troubleshooting, and no

27
00:01:36,915 --> 00:01:38,985
correlation with the clinical workflows.

28
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:45,345
For instance, a system crash might only
be noticed after it delays patient care.

29
00:01:45,845 --> 00:01:50,705
In contrast, advanced Observability
provides end-to-end visibility

30
00:01:50,705 --> 00:01:56,045
across care pathways, unified tracing
of patient journeys and proactive

31
00:01:56,555 --> 00:01:58,475
analytics to prevent disruptions.

32
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:02,855
It directly links system health
to patient outcomes, ensuring

33
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,675
it issues don't compromise care.

34
00:02:06,175 --> 00:02:11,395
This dashboard shows how observability
integrate metrics for real-time insights.

35
00:02:11,695 --> 00:02:16,045
This is a shift in game changer
for healthcare reliability.

36
00:02:16,545 --> 00:02:20,805
Healthcare observability is
not just about tech, it's about

37
00:02:20,895 --> 00:02:22,455
patient safety and compliance.

38
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,060
First, we need HIPAA and GDPR
complaints, monitoring and encryption,

39
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,050
audit trials, and role-based
access to productions, to data.

40
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:38,400
Second, analytics musing technical metrics
to critical outcomes so we can prioritize

41
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,440
issues that affect patient directly.

42
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:46,350
For example, a CS slow system could
delay critical care and observability.

43
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,270
Help us catch that in real time.

44
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,570
Here is an example of HIPA
compliance monitoring interface.

45
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,650
Finally, high availability
is non-negotiable.

46
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:04,480
We need fault tolerance system with 99.99%
up, down, and automated failover to ensure

47
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,260
critical visibility even during outages.

48
00:03:07,945 --> 00:03:12,985
This requirement to ensure observability
support life critical systems.

49
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:17,085
Let's look at the real world example
of how this principle were applied

50
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:19,595
in one critical care scenario.

51
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:25,715
Unpredicted system latency across
interconnected services was slowing

52
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:28,445
responses times putting patients at risk.

53
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:30,815
To address this, we
implemented end to end.

54
00:03:31,315 --> 00:03:35,965
Distributed tracing with custom
in infrastructure across all

55
00:03:36,355 --> 00:03:38,365
clinic service boundaries.

56
00:03:38,865 --> 00:03:43,605
As a result, a 67% reduction in
troubleshooting time, allowing

57
00:03:43,605 --> 00:03:47,655
us to resolve issues before they
escalated to clinical disruptions.

58
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:50,865
This means faster, safer care delivery.

59
00:03:51,115 --> 00:03:55,920
This graph shows the drop in
troubleshooting time post implementation.

60
00:03:56,615 --> 00:04:00,665
This case study shows how observability
directly improves patient outcomes.

61
00:04:01,265 --> 00:04:04,595
Next, let's see how observability
performs under pressure.

62
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:07,095
Like during p peak load,

63
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:12,045
during high traffic period peak time
volumes systems are under immense strain.

64
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:17,995
Our data shows system reliability
dropping by 75% at peak load

65
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:20,425
without proper observability.

66
00:04:21,265 --> 00:04:25,045
This chart shows the reliability
dipping as patient volume spikes.

67
00:04:25,645 --> 00:04:30,325
By implementing advanced telemetry
collections, we achieved a 58%

68
00:04:30,325 --> 00:04:32,035
improvement in system reliability.

69
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:37,855
During this period, real-time adjustment
based on observability data prevented

70
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:42,970
service degradation, ensuring critical
healthcare operations continue smoothly.

71
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:47,755
This highlights how observability
maintains stability when it matters most.

72
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,465
Now let's explore how
AI is revolutionizing

73
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:52,785
observability in healthcare.

74
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:57,005
AIOps is transforming
healthcare observability first.

75
00:04:57,425 --> 00:05:04,055
Predictive analysis can anticipate system
failures 24 to 48 hours in advance with

76
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:09,425
the 93% accuracy, allowing proactive
fixes before patient care is implemented.

77
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:12,525
This model predict failure
with high accuracy.

78
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:12,630
Yes.

79
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:20,670
Second intelligent filter reduces false
post to alarms by 71%, focusing IT

80
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,860
teams on clinically significant issues.

81
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,340
Finally, automated remediation
enable self-healing system resolving

82
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,230
complex issues in minutes and
cutting it interventions by 64%.

83
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:39,300
This dashboard prioritize critical
alerts AIOps, make observability

84
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,430
smarter and more efficient.

85
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,080
Let's see how HBase
observability takes this further.

86
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,990
HBase observability brings monitoring
close to the point of care.

87
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:55,930
It reduces latency by 83%, enable
critical distance in milliseconds.

88
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,880
It also ensure continuous monitoring
during network disruptions vital

89
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,800
for unrepped uninterrupted care.

90
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,335
This shows age monitoring in action.

91
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:11,845
Additionally, local data processing
enhance privacy complaints by

92
00:06:11,845 --> 00:06:13,735
handling since two data at the source.

93
00:06:14,215 --> 00:06:19,045
Finally, real time anomaly detection
at the point of care lets clinicians

94
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,195
address issues before the affect patients.

95
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:25,005
So how do we implement this?

96
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,315
Let's look at the strategy.

97
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:30,295
Implementing observability
requires a structured approach.

98
00:06:30,835 --> 00:06:31,855
First assessment.

99
00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:37,355
For assessment, it requires audit
existing systems, identify gaps

100
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:41,405
in clinical workflows, and define
healthcare specific requirements.

101
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:42,965
Next, implementation.

102
00:06:43,655 --> 00:06:48,275
Deploying distributor pricing,
integrate metric logs, and

103
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:52,790
traces into unified platform and
ensure HIP and GDR compliance.

104
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,490
This workflow outlines
our implementation steps.

105
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:03,510
Finally, adoption train clinical and
IT staff foster a data driven culture

106
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,290
and build a cross functional responses.

107
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:12,860
Teams this strategy ensure observability
aligned with the patient care priorities.

108
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,970
Let's see how these components
fit into a broader framework.

109
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:21,510
Our healthcare observability framework
has three layers, the technical metrics

110
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:26,370
layer, monitoring infrastructure
applications, and the network with

111
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:31,410
the healthcare specific threshold For
critical care, the business impact layer

112
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:37,150
correlate system performance with patient
outcomes, optimizing treatment, timing.

113
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,400
The compliance layer ensure
continuous HIPAA and GDPR

114
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,500
complaints with automated reporting.

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,820
Let's wrap up with the key take ofs

116
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:54,670
to summarize advance observability,
reduce meantime to resolution by 84%

117
00:07:54,670 --> 00:08:00,130
and boost system reliability by 76%
directly improving clinical outcomes.

118
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,720
It must be a core architecture
principle, not an afterthought.

119
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:10,570
We need to link technical metrics
to patient care and design solutions

120
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:15,100
with the compliance first, by
providing observability, we built

121
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,630
resilient systems that save time.

122
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,570
Thank you for your attention.

123
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,470
Observability is the backbone of
a reliable healthcare system, and

124
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,160
I hope this presentation showed
a transformative potential.

125
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:27,540
Thank you.
