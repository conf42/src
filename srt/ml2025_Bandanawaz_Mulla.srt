00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:02,310
Hello guys.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,690
Thanks for joining me today.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:10,290
This is Bandana Muah, and I have
more than 19 years of IT industry

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,430
experience on variety skills and roles.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:21,180
Currently, I'm working as a senior
software engineering manager, and today

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:28,680
I'm going to talk about some of the key
challenges we have on value-based care.

7
00:00:29,685 --> 00:00:37,275
Implementation in healthcare and how
solutions or basically cloud-based

8
00:00:37,275 --> 00:00:39,615
solutions help overcome these challenges.

9
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:41,445
Okay.

10
00:00:41,445 --> 00:00:49,129
Let's talk about what is a
value-based care program and.

11
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,610
How the cloud solutions
help overcome this?

12
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:00,690
Value-based care represents a fundamental
shift in healthcare delivery from volume

13
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,990
to value with payment based on patient
outcomes rather than service quantity.

14
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,200
This approach emphasizes
preventative care, effective chronic

15
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,090
disease management, coordinated
delivery, and patient engagement.

16
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:26,130
However, organizations face significant
implementation challenges that cloud

17
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,960
solutions can uniquely address.

18
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,770
This presentation explores how cloud
technologies provide the infrastructure,

19
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:42,000
scalability, and in Interability needed
to make value-based care successful in

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,060
today's complex healthcare landscape.

21
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:54,419
Let's talk about value-based
care fundamentals transitioning

22
00:01:54,419 --> 00:01:58,740
from traditional fee for service.

23
00:01:58,889 --> 00:02:04,440
That is more services equal to
more revenue, to the quality-based

24
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:09,840
reimbursement where providers earn
incentives for meeting benchmark,

25
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,500
reducing cost, and improving satisfaction.

26
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,960
This emphasizes preventive care
strategies, comprehensive chronic

27
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,190
disease management programs,
coordinated care across multiple

28
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,140
providers and active patient
participation in healthcare decisions.

29
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,590
Success requires tracking numerous quality
metrics, including clinical outcomes,

30
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,530
cost efficiency, patient experience
measures, and population health indicators

31
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,380
across diverse patient populations.

32
00:02:44,445 --> 00:02:50,025
While the VBC model promises better
care at lower costs, implementing

33
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:54,945
it requires substantial changes to
workflows, technology, infrastructure,

34
00:02:55,185 --> 00:02:57,285
and organizational culture.

35
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,745
Healthcare system must overcome
several significant challenges

36
00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:04,605
to realize its full potential.

37
00:03:05,505 --> 00:03:10,605
Now let's move on to understand
the data fragmentation challenges.

38
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:16,065
Patient information exists
in siloed systems across

39
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:18,615
multiple providers, including

40
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:26,055
electronic health records that
EHRs, laboratory systems, pharmacy

41
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:31,125
databases, billing platforms,
and specialty care records.

42
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:38,190
This fragmentation creates blind spots
in clinical decision making, impacts care

43
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,000
coordination, and makes comprehensive
quality reporting nearly impossible.

44
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:48,510
Cloud-based solutions helps create
unified data lakes that aggregates

45
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,589
information from D Dispar sources
into a single accessible repository.

46
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,780
Fire based APIs and HL seven integration
engines enable real time bidirectional

47
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:06,450
data sharing between previously
INCAP incompatible systems, creating

48
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:12,300
a comprehensive patient view data
normalization services, standardized

49
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,399
information from different sources, making
it usable for analytics and reporting.

50
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:21,945
By leveraging Cloud Solutions
healthcare organization can

51
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:26,895
eliminate data silos, creating a
holistic view of patient journey

52
00:04:26,895 --> 00:04:30,015
that supports true value-based care.

53
00:04:31,695 --> 00:04:37,664
Okay, now let's talk about how
cloud solutions help in streamlining

54
00:04:37,725 --> 00:04:39,795
complex reporting requirements.

55
00:04:41,145 --> 00:04:44,115
Automated extraction from
multiple sources into cloud.

56
00:04:46,005 --> 00:04:51,935
Data lake is the best example
where every organization might

57
00:04:51,935 --> 00:04:53,315
be seeing the benefits today

58
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:59,345
processing using the cloud solutions.

59

API automates these processes reducing
manual work, while improving accuracy

69
00:05:52,805 --> 00:05:57,965
and timeliness With cloud-based
analytics, organization can identify

70
00:05:57,965 --> 00:06:02,765
care gaps immediately rather than with
discovering them during the retro spec.

71
00:06:02,765 --> 00:06:08,165
Two reviews, enabling proactive
interventions that improve

72
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:10,055

Design data governance framework that
maintain compliance while enabling

175
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,569
analytics, implement identity
management solutions that support

176
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,849
appropriate access across organizations

177
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:31,964
integration and adoption Where.

178
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:36,719
Use fire based APIs to
standardize data exchange.

179
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,610
Develop comprehensive training
programs for all staff levels, create

180
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:47,490
feedback mechanism to continuously
improve the system based on real world

181
00:14:47,495 --> 00:14:49,905
usage pattern and user suggestions.

182
00:14:51,344 --> 00:14:54,334
Successful implementation
requires thoughtful planning

183
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,310
and strategic approach.

184
00:14:57,569 --> 00:15:01,980
Organizations should start with clearly
defined outcomes and build incremental.

185
00:15:02,864 --> 00:15:06,914
Incrementally focusing on
demonstrating value at each

186
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:11,324
phase, or rather than attempting
a complete transformation at once.

187
00:15:11,685 --> 00:15:19,244
Now, let's talk about the feature of
cloud enabled value-based care solutions.

188
00:15:20,564 --> 00:15:26,594
If you look at the screen, you see the
tremendous cost reduction in the IT

189
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:29,449
implementation, which is around 40%.

190
00:15:32,324 --> 00:15:42,704
And 68% efficiency, increasing
efficiency in reporting 3.2

191
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,439
times return on investment,

192
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:48,579
24 by seven availability.

193
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,925
So let's deep dial a little more.

194
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:54,439
You

195
00:15:56,954 --> 00:15:58,280
can see the sources of these.

196
00:15:59,594 --> 00:16:04,694
Data or the facts on the
bottom of the each item.

197
00:16:05,804 --> 00:16:10,034
So in the cost reduction, healthcare
organizations have seen an average

198
00:16:10,034 --> 00:16:14,054
operational saving of 40% after
migrating to cloud platforms.

199
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:18,044
This is primarily due to the
reduced IT infrastructure,

200
00:16:18,404 --> 00:16:24,344
lower physical data storage and
minimized server maintenance costs,

201
00:16:26,354 --> 00:16:27,584
reporting efficiencies.

202
00:16:27,974 --> 00:16:32,024
By automating reporting processes,
cloud platforms have helped

203
00:16:32,084 --> 00:16:37,394
healthcare organizations reduce time
spent on quality reporting by 68%.

204
00:16:38,774 --> 00:16:43,094
Real time data extraction analytics,
and integration with regulatory

205
00:16:43,094 --> 00:16:47,384
frameworks such as and a CO
have streamlined this process.

206
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:53,424
Return on investment cloud adoption in
healthcare has led to an average of three.

207
00:16:54,594 --> 00:16:57,384
Point two times the return of investment.

208
00:16:58,404 --> 00:17:02,664
This is driven by operational
efficiency improvements, faster and

209
00:17:02,664 --> 00:17:06,114
more accurate decisions making and
reduced administrative overhead.

210
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:11,460
Cloud solutions are available 24 by seven,

211
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:19,044
which helps access to critical healthcare
data enhancing care coordination.

212
00:17:19,944 --> 00:17:24,324
Enabling timely inter interventions
and improving patient outcomes

213
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:25,704
through the real time monitoring.

214
00:17:28,044 --> 00:17:35,455
