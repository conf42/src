1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:01,740
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,190
This is I'm a solution
architect working at Callans.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,570
Welcome to the conference 42
site, reliable Engineering,

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,660
occurring on April 17th.

5
00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:19,400
Without having much delay, let me get
into the, today's topic into the deck.

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:20,630
Yeah.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,189
Today's topic.

8
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:26,740
I'm speaking about how we can
enhance SRE practices using ai.

9
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:31,285
And how we can build more
resilient cloud native platforms.

10
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:37,575
In this session, we'll identify how
to AI capabilities are transforming

11
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:41,385
site reliability, engineering
practices in the modern admirations.

12
00:00:41,655 --> 00:00:44,835
And also we'll explore some
practical implementations that

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:49,035
drive that improvements in different
aspects such as reliability,

14
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:51,525
efficiency, and cost management.

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,625
Yeah, we can first see the convergence
between AI and SRE for this.

16
00:00:58,635 --> 00:01:05,800
We'll first go to SRE practices where
manual incident response workflows

17
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:10,190
requiring human intervention in every
aspect of reporting the incidents.

18
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:15,350
Also, the reactive monitoring focus
on current system status, not any

19
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,260
other future we cannot predict here.

20
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:23,295
And also we have mostly is a static rule
based alerting when that threshold meets

21
00:01:23,295 --> 00:01:25,485
of static particular point or something.

22
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:30,195
And also, we are not going to do
the, any historical it is always

23
00:01:30,205 --> 00:01:33,775
go with the historical analysis
and do the necessary performance.

24
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:34,125
Things.

25
00:01:34,155 --> 00:01:38,435
This is how, if we have been dealing
with the traditional practices,

26
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,565
when comes when it comes to ai.

27
00:01:42,255 --> 00:01:42,975
Practices.

28
00:01:43,245 --> 00:01:45,795
Here you are doing some
kind of automation.

29
00:01:45,945 --> 00:01:51,595
And also we will have self ailing
capabilities for any problem that arises.

30
00:01:52,135 --> 00:01:57,545
Along with that, it also does
this react to monitoring that

31
00:01:57,545 --> 00:01:58,910
forecast potential issues.

32
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,715
Then we'll have the, rather than
static alerts here, we will have

33
00:02:04,715 --> 00:02:08,960
the intelligent alerts and also
dynamic priority adjustments.

34
00:02:10,865 --> 00:02:13,685
Forward looking insights
through pattern recognitions.

35
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:20,535
These two areas are very diff
important when you compare with

36
00:02:20,535 --> 00:02:23,055
the traditional and AI manual.

37
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:25,695
Traditional, you are always with
the handling with the static

38
00:02:25,695 --> 00:02:27,255
related things and manual efforts.

39
00:02:27,645 --> 00:02:31,825
When it comes to ai in SRE space,
you are doing the more automated

40
00:02:32,425 --> 00:02:34,675
predictive as well as intelligence.

41
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:40,005
It'll, you'll apply some kind of patterns
recognitions based on that, these two

42
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:44,445
approaches, you can easily identify where
I'm navigating in my father's slides.

43
00:02:45,445 --> 00:02:50,715
The, this way you are going to
reduce Mt. Dity is going to be 25%

44
00:02:50,805 --> 00:02:54,575
where it can reduce identify the
detection and potential issues.

45
00:02:54,935 --> 00:02:57,125
These are the, some of the
key performance improvements.

46
00:02:57,665 --> 00:02:59,285
Also service availability.

47
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,985
It is going to improve by almost 30%.

48
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:07,790
You'll identify the detect problems
early around 23% improvement here.

49
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,370
In case of pallets, it's going to
be reduced almost 27% because of the

50
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,500
a involvement in the site level ing

51
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,610
in this triangular.

52
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,360
We'll go from bottom to top.

53
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,120
First we'll take the near
driven observability.

54
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,380
First we'll take the top bottom one,
which is a comprehensive telemetry

55
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:36,770
where s data collections that optimizes
a signal to noise ratio while ensuring

56
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,870
complete visibility across the stack.

57
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,360
It is the more robust area where you'll
take, capture all the information and

58
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,890
does the required processing here.

59
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,710
Then we'll put apply the
machine learning models.

60
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,620
Where it automate the baselines,
how it helps is you can have dynamic

61
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,780
thresholds that continuously adapt to
a seasonal variations and growth trends

62
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,360
and use this patterns on top of it.

63
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,930
You'll have a, once you have
the comprehensive tele automated

64
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,360
baseline, you can find the patterns.

65
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,160
That is what pattern recognition
plays advanced algorithms that detect

66
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,780
a non-obvious relationship between
seemingly unrelated systems and services.

67
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,110
On top of patterns, we will have
the intelligent visualization.

68
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:29,430
How you look at, from the a point of view,
it is more reliable reliable, real time,

69
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:35,160
context based dashboards and automatically
highlight what are the critical metrics

70
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,620
and potential issues that may arise.

71
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,720
Now we'll go for anomaly
detection using mission learning.

72
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,660
First, we'll start with
the base establishment.

73
00:04:47,185 --> 00:04:51,555
In base establishment, we will have the
stimulated algorithms where it learns

74
00:04:51,555 --> 00:04:57,045
normal operation patterns and performance
signatures across the distributor systems.

75
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:04,275
Continuous monitoring, realtime
telemetry systems are our streams

76
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:08,370
are analyzed, diagnosed, established
baselines with microsecond precisions.

77
00:05:09,255 --> 00:05:13,520
Deviation detection, how it moves,
okay, it is going in the parallel line.

78
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,145
What is the planned one, which
is in the threshold or not, and

79
00:05:17,145 --> 00:05:22,185
how it behaves based on, then it
goes to the deviation detection.

80
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:22,665
Okay?

81
00:05:22,665 --> 00:05:27,555
Once you have this setup, if something
is happening, false positives

82
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:30,225
are behavior of this algorithms.

83
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,415
Then it'll go to the model refinement.

84
00:05:32,805 --> 00:05:35,535
Once you have the mission learning
models continuously evolve.

85
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,300
Through automated feedback
loops in this spiral we can

86
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,980
improve the accuracy war time.

87
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,370
That's where the machine learning helps
to find the anomalies in SRE space.

88
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:54,050
This slide talks about how AI
powering the cas engineering.

89
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,360
Intelligent test designs AI algorithms,
analyze system dependencies to

90
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:05,060
identify critical failure points
and design targeted experiments

91
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,360
with maximum learning potential.

92
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,600
Second point is automated
execution precisely controls,

93
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,310
failures simultaneously.

94
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:22,115
Deploy during the low traffic window with
the comprehensive safety mechanisms to

95
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:26,915
prevent cascading production impacts, to,
we need to identify, okay, what was the

96
00:06:27,245 --> 00:06:32,985
low business hours so that we can exclude
the necessary scripts so that the any

97
00:06:32,985 --> 00:06:35,355
problem comes, the impact will reduce.

98
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,980
We'll have the real time analysis,
sophisticated monitoring, capture

99
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:44,590
system, degradation pattern, and compare
actual re resilience metrics against

100
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:50,350
with the machine learning predictor
failure responses, resilience, implement

101
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:57,155
identified vulnerabilities, trigger
automated remediation, workflows that

102
00:06:57,185 --> 00:07:01,480
implement infrastructure changes,
enhancing the system durability,

103
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,820
agonist feature disruptions.

104
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,910
How the natural language
processing for post analysis.

105
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,160
Once we have those things, how
your natural language processing

106
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,630
and LP works for analyze purpose.

107
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,910
In this, we'll go one after one
automated instant documentation.

108
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,860
AI transcribes users organizes to
communication During the instance

109
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,200
it identify the pattern recognition.

110
00:07:27,695 --> 00:07:30,955
System identifies similar with
the previous instance like that.

111
00:07:31,255 --> 00:07:36,665
Then I work on the root cause
analysis, NLP extract all ca casual

112
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,585
relationship from technical discussions.

113
00:07:39,245 --> 00:07:43,115
Then it find out all the
necessary information for the

114
00:07:43,115 --> 00:07:44,495
analysis based enhancements.

115
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:45,830
Automatically.

116
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,535
And it updates runbooks as well as
documentation related to the entire

117
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:56,000
postma analysis, anything happen, what
happened, why any problem occur, and how

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,550
we can improve our predictive algorithms.

119
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,280
In future.

120
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,450
This helps.

121
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,880
This step is very important
for lesser lens purpose.

122
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,550
Let's take one case study here
before jumping into the other topic.

123
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:13,135
Mainly we are focusing now on
financial service platform here.

124
00:08:13,185 --> 00:08:15,545
It is all related to dollars numbers.

125
00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:18,965
The challenge is if you take a
critical payment processing system,

126
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:23,865
if any outage happens in a particular
business let's say it is almost 150

127
00:08:23,865 --> 00:08:26,970
K revenue loss per hour downtime.

128
00:08:27,855 --> 00:08:31,385
If you implement this sophisticated
algorithms in machine learning,

129
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,415
you can predict, identify the
transaction flow and a analyze

130
00:08:34,445 --> 00:08:36,365
before they cascade into the phases.

131
00:08:37,355 --> 00:08:42,045
Meantime to resolutions dramatically
reduce from 45 minutes to 12 minutes,

132
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:47,815
improving customer experience that
automatically helps to bring up uptime

133
00:08:47,815 --> 00:08:53,105
is more then it'll in inherently
helps the customer satisfaction.

134
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:58,735
A return on investments, if you say it
creates almost like a $3.2 million savings

135
00:08:58,735 --> 00:09:03,715
through enhances system availability
and prevents revenue impacting outages.

136
00:09:03,865 --> 00:09:04,495
Later on

137
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:08,240
here we go to a enhanced
capacity planning.

138
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,040
In this session, I probably
highlight the top headings.

139
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,930
It is mainly historical analysis.

140
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:18,295
Demand predictions, scenario
modeling and automated provisioning.

141
00:09:18,565 --> 00:09:21,145
It is like a spiral loop or keep.

142
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:24,415
We had to do, we had to identify
the, what is the available data.

143
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:26,995
Then we need to find out
that what is the demand?

144
00:09:27,445 --> 00:09:29,665
Then find out the model that works.

145
00:09:29,725 --> 00:09:34,525
Then we have to automate that steps,
orchestrate those areas, how we can

146
00:09:34,765 --> 00:09:36,145
practically scale the infrastructure.

147
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,810
Are any problem coming up and
how we can effectively utilize,

148
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,180
eliminate any cost or provisioning?

149
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,750
Yeah, it is like simply, okay,
how much you need that much.

150
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:53,350
You assign the infrastructure concept
if it is a peak load is coming here.

151
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,950
Since our models are efficient, it
identify and improve the elastic means.

152
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:02,585
How we can implement this strategy.

153
00:10:02,825 --> 00:10:07,605
First, we need to assess the
current maturity how we need

154
00:10:07,605 --> 00:10:11,215
to evaluate the existing SRA
practices and identify the gaps.

155
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,485
You have to start with small
and experiment around it.

156
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:20,335
Then build internal area,
develop cross-functional

157
00:10:20,435 --> 00:10:21,995
SRE skills with the teams.

158
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:26,755
Then we go with the successful scaling
of all the entire organization level.

159
00:10:27,475 --> 00:10:31,325
It is all okay, first try test
it, then you feel comfortable.

160
00:10:31,475 --> 00:10:34,685
Then talk to the all the,
within the teams and implement

161
00:10:34,685 --> 00:10:36,735
within the your develop area.

162
00:10:37,065 --> 00:10:40,055
Then we can go with the
entire company level changes.

163
00:10:40,895 --> 00:10:41,975
That's how we can scale up

164
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:43,815
in this exercise.

165
00:10:43,815 --> 00:10:45,285
What are the key takeaways

166
00:10:47,805 --> 00:10:49,065
you can measure The impact?

167
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:54,730
Based on this practices you can
identify what how to quantify the

168
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:59,680
implements and reliability of the
metrics and cost efficiency, how

169
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,320
it evolution, not a revolution.

170
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:07,305
It is all start small starts with
the targeted implementation that

171
00:11:07,305 --> 00:11:10,815
complement existing practices,
then improve the skills.

172
00:11:11,955 --> 00:11:16,095
Any successful thing you need, have
invest in both technical capabilities

173
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:21,865
and our national culture that helps
a smooth transition and have a better

174
00:11:21,865 --> 00:11:23,975
future with advancing technologies.

175
00:11:24,485 --> 00:11:27,455
Then of course, you have to look
at the forward looking areas where

176
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:31,955
SRE will increasingly rely on the
artificial intelligence to manage

177
00:11:32,015 --> 00:11:33,935
complex or distributed systems.

178
00:11:36,425 --> 00:11:39,546
Now we'll go with the,
what is the role in.

179
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,080
Enterprise application integration in
a modern cloud environments for SRE.

180
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,170
In today's fast paced and distributor
systems, enterprises are leveraging cloud

181
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:59,215
infrastructure to host, manage, and a
wide variety of applications, especially.

182
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:02,470
Integration of this
application is critical.

183
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,750
To have a unified system that
functions smoothly regardless of

184
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,070
the underlying infrastructure.

185
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:15,050
Why SRE and integration matters
every time you go with the a p

186
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:19,870
protocols to talk to your backend
systems and front end applications.

187
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,090
That is where the integration also
plays a very critical role where

188
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,980
I've been expertise in my career.

189
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,460
If you go with the cloud-based
integration, the cloud provides.

190
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:35,040
Flexibility, scalability for integrating
the applications, data sources and systems

191
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,170
across Mpromise, hybrid, R Multicloud,
enrollments, tenants, anywhere.

192
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,340
If you go with the IPAs, that is
integration as a platform, as service.

193
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,180
There are multiple IPAs solutions
like MuleSoft, Azure Logic apps

194
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,420
help integrate applications
and data sources in the cloud.

195
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:56,020
Not only IPOs, you have a
past application such as SAB

196
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,535
integration Suite and other areas.

197
00:12:58,075 --> 00:13:00,595
Where you can develop your
own integration models.

198
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:03,855
That also helps in the integration area.

199
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:08,445
When it comes to a p management, these
are the critical for cloud a EI In

200
00:13:08,445 --> 00:13:13,725
SRU space, managing and monitoring
these APIs is crucial to ensure the

201
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:15,945
uptime, scalability, and reliability.

202
00:13:16,305 --> 00:13:19,055
That's where I was talking
about EI and SRE relation.

203
00:13:19,325 --> 00:13:22,875
There are so many APIs you need
to talk back and forth using rest

204
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:27,065
services or, lightweight applications,
lightweight protocols, all the stuff.

205
00:13:28,065 --> 00:13:31,425
What are the key takeaways
techniques applied in AI?

206
00:13:31,455 --> 00:13:35,625
For site relatability engineering,
you have predictive analytics,

207
00:13:37,815 --> 00:13:40,725
anomaly detection, root cause analysis.

208
00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:43,510
This is automated decision making.

209
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:49,545
In predictive, AI driven predictive
analytics can forecast system behavior.

210
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:58,185
Also detect potential failures before it
attack so that SRE teams can proactively

211
00:13:58,185 --> 00:14:00,315
manage and address those risks.

212
00:14:01,065 --> 00:14:05,595
For example, predicting traffic
spikes and resource bottlenecks,

213
00:14:06,885 --> 00:14:12,015
enabling the auto scaling in cloud
environments, anomaly detection.

214
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:16,040
EA models can analyze
large volumes of data.

215
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:22,050
To detect anomalies or performance
integration systems allowing

216
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,530
for faster identification of
issues in the cloud environment.

217
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,540
Okay.

218
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,800
For example, like a port systems
can detect usual patterns in

219
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,900
a p calls of database queries.

220
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:40,240
Triggering automated alerts to SRE
teams in root cause can assist in d

221
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,460
diagnosing that root cause of failures.

222
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:48,055
By analyzing the logs metrics system
status across integrated applications,

223
00:14:48,685 --> 00:14:53,695
this accelerate troubleshooting
time and also incident response.

224
00:14:54,745 --> 00:14:59,365
Example, like a, those can correlate
performance issues across microservices

225
00:14:59,605 --> 00:15:06,895
and identify the exact service causing
latency, aiding the faster decision for

226
00:15:06,895 --> 00:15:09,535
the teams who are working in this area.

227
00:15:11,005 --> 00:15:12,685
Also automated decision making

228
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,805
AI can automate decision making in
cloud ai, such as load balancing.

229
00:15:21,115 --> 00:15:25,275
Yeah, you have load balances even
nowadays with F five and done, but this

230
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:31,605
helps much more better to boost those
as well scaling operations based on

231
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:35,985
the realtime analysis of application
performance and infrastructure health,

232
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:39,045
using the mission learning models.

233
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,470
Predict to server, predict server
load, and automatically adjust

234
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:49,140
resources to ensure opt optimal
performance and optimum uptime.

235
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,030
In conclusion, the future of EI cloud AI
and SRE, it is a continuation evolution.

236
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,080
E you know that cloud services and
AI technologies value every day.

237
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,710
The SRE teams will have even more powerful
tools in coming days and to ensure.

238
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,450
The reliability performance of
integrated applications from across

239
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:16,430
the enterprise in during this process,
you can improve the automation.

240
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,950
The combination of cloud based
integration, AI, SRE principles will

241
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:28,490
lead to more automated systems in
the manual intervention and improving

242
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,160
the system uptime at the same time.

243
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,230
In this fast paced world, you
have to have good collaboration.

244
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,990
In this space, SRA teams will need
to have a good collaboration with

245
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:47,650
the DevOps teams, cloud architects,
and data scientists for what purpose?

246
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:53,050
To build a resilient, scalable,
and intelligent system.

247
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:58,080
That is the goal for today's SRE
topic, including a finance system.

248
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,000
Example, integration examples.

249
00:17:00,805 --> 00:17:07,375
How we can enable the systems in
the past, future technologies,

250
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:11,305
how we can utilize our machine
learning models, how we can use your

251
00:17:11,305 --> 00:17:12,925
natural language processing models.

252
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:20,265
That helps to have the better and
the best SRE teams going forward

253
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:25,695
into the enterprise applications
across the company organization.

254
00:17:26,835 --> 00:17:27,195
Thank you.
