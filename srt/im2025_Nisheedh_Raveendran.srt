1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,189
Hi folks.

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:05,539
I'm NHI re an experienced
software professional with

3
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:09,709
over two decades experience in
building large scale distributed

4
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:12,290
systems and low latency system.

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:18,495
In today's talk I'll talk about managing
regulatory incidents in hipaa, GDPR, and.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,390
DMA environments.

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:26,990
Today's agenda will be split
into five different sections.

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,040
The first section about it will
be about the regulatory incident

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,170
paradox, which will talk about the
competing needs for quickly mitigating

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,620
issue while balancing the need to.

11
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,980
Meet the compliance requirements and
then we'll move on to look at the

12
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:50,609
regulatory landscape and the shortcomings
of the various key regulations in

13
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:53,664
place like hipaa, GDPR, and DMA.

14
00:00:54,294 --> 00:00:58,405
Once we understand the lay of the
land, we will move to the compliance

15
00:00:58,405 --> 00:01:03,144
aware framework where I will
introduce your robust framework to

16
00:01:03,144 --> 00:01:09,235
integrate regulatory obligations
while meeting the most important

17
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,755
need to meet the technical recovery.

18
00:01:12,475 --> 00:01:15,464
After introducing the competency
wire framework, I'll move

19
00:01:15,464 --> 00:01:20,084
to balancing priorities and
communications during an incident.

20
00:01:20,184 --> 00:01:25,134
The last part of the talk will be about
building your own incident playbook,

21
00:01:25,584 --> 00:01:30,984
where I'll provide practical tapes for
developing a comprehensive compliance

22
00:01:30,984 --> 00:01:34,114
ready incident response playbook.

23
00:01:34,614 --> 00:01:38,624
Alright let's get started with
the regulatory incident paradox.

24
00:01:39,074 --> 00:01:45,264
When systems fail the responders or
operators face a dual mandate, right?

25
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:49,964
The first priority is about the
technical recovery, which is mainly

26
00:01:49,964 --> 00:01:55,004
about restoring the system functionality
and mitigating the data laws, and

27
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,504
prevent any cascading failures.

28
00:01:57,094 --> 00:02:00,874
And stabilize the environment
to get back to the steady state.

29
00:02:00,994 --> 00:02:07,814
The competing side of an incident is like
the regulatory obligations where things

30
00:02:07,814 --> 00:02:12,945
like the mandatory reporting timelines and
the documentation requirements come into

31
00:02:12,945 --> 00:02:19,094
play, along with evidence preservation
and the legal and forensic mandates.

32
00:02:19,594 --> 00:02:24,145
So the first part so basically the
technical recovery is more about speed.

33
00:02:24,505 --> 00:02:29,245
We need to recover the system
as quickly as possible, which

34
00:02:29,245 --> 00:02:33,655
competes with the accuracy needs
for the regulatory obligations.

35
00:02:33,755 --> 00:02:37,235
Another aspect is the
resourcing conflict, right?

36
00:02:37,335 --> 00:02:44,235
Most of the times the responder team will
be small and the teams are pulled between

37
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:50,855
immediate remediation and while, the while
they have the conflicting need to meet

38
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:53,225
the administrative burden of compliance.

39
00:02:53,605 --> 00:02:57,475
This also brings up the comp
communication challenges.

40
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:02,525
Balancing transparent, timely
communication with the legal and

41
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:07,295
the regulatory constraints on
the shared information comes into

42
00:03:07,295 --> 00:03:09,665
picture while mitigating incidents.

43
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,555
Before we understand the,

44
00:03:12,055 --> 00:03:12,275
the.

45
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:16,465
Framework, it's important to
understand the regulatory landscape.

46
00:03:17,065 --> 00:03:22,455
So the current regulatory landscape can
be split into three broad categories.

47
00:03:22,455 --> 00:03:27,825
The first one is hipaa, which mainly
deals with the healthcare regulations.

48
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:34,100
The HIPAA mandates that any reporting
of the personal health information

49
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,460
incidents should happen within 60 days.

50
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:42,430
It mandates, the required notification
is sent to the affected individuals

51
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,769
along with the regulatory bodies like
HHS and potentially media outlets

52
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:50,230
depending on the scale of the incident.

53
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,050
And thorough risk as assessments
are mandated for accurate

54
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,610
incident classification.

55
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:02,750
The second important regulation is GDPR,
which is EU mandated data protection.

56
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,280
It enforces a 72 hour breach
notification to supervising authorities.

57
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,720
For any high risk breaches, it requests
the data subject notification without any

58
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:20,380
UE delay and detailed documentation and
impact essence assessments are essential.

59
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,000
The the last or the
latest regulation is d.

60
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,660
Short form for the digital markets side,
which demands transparent communication

61
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,390
regarding any algorithmic failures.

62
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,740
Imposes continuous service obligation
even during incident responses.

63
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:44,530
DMA put constraints during
mitigations by establishing strict

64
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,630
rules on sensitive data access.

65
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:49,775
And usage during recovery efforts.

66
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:55,705
Now let's dive a little more deeper
into each of these regulations.

67
00:04:55,735 --> 00:04:56,935
Let's start with hipaa.

68
00:04:57,555 --> 00:05:00,640
HIPAA comes into picture when
the healthcare systems fails.

69
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:06,665
It brings unique challenges like balancing
emergency service availability with

70
00:05:06,665 --> 00:05:11,385
the breach containment and determining
if any personal health information

71
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:13,695
was compromised during system outages.

72
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:19,925
Also mandating the forensic
evidence are collected while

73
00:05:19,925 --> 00:05:21,665
restoring critical services.

74
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,989
It also mandate conducting risk
assessments during active incidents.

75
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:32,159
The breach notification rule from
HIPAA mandates that any breaches

76
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:37,539
with the PHI incidents are reported
to HHS and potentially media.

77
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,159
Typically within 60 days.

78
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:43,759
A direct notification to affected
individuals should be sent

79
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:46,329
without any undue or delay.

80
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:51,149
Detailing incident information
involved and mitigation steps.

81
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:55,039
He also involves risk
assessment and documentation.

82
00:05:55,579 --> 00:06:01,734
The risk assessment ensures that
we can classify the breach severity

83
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:05,514
correctly along with the detailed
documentation of the incident.

84
00:06:05,604 --> 00:06:06,324
Response.

85
00:06:06,384 --> 00:06:10,104
And decision is crucial
for compliance and audits.

86
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:12,284
Let's move to GDPR.

87
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:18,964
The key thing to about GDPR is about
racing against the 72 hour clock.

88
00:06:19,054 --> 00:06:24,244
It starts from R zero when the incident is
first reported through an alerting or any

89
00:06:24,244 --> 00:06:27,214
other auto detection mechanisms and asked.

90
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:31,249
Zero to 24 is where the
preliminary assessment is done.

91
00:06:31,549 --> 00:06:35,119
Determine the most important thing
is to determine if any personal data

92
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:39,619
was affected and then start, begin
evidence collection for later reporting.

93
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:44,119
And R 24 to 28 is about
further risk assessment.

94
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:49,669
Evaluate the risk to impacted subjects
and draft the notification documents.

95
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:56,104
During hours 48 to 72 can be
classified as the notification period.

96
00:06:56,734 --> 00:07:00,094
During this period, submit the
notification to the supervisory

97
00:07:00,094 --> 00:07:04,324
authority and prepare communication
to the impacted individuals.

98
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:09,094
Let's quickly take a look
at the DMA mandate as well.

99
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:10,754
The digital markets Act.

100
00:07:10,854 --> 00:07:15,435
Places a specific stringent
obligations on tech platforms

101
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:19,655
called gatekeepers, introducing
unique incident response challenges.

102
00:07:20,145 --> 00:07:22,995
It should ensure that it should
ensure that maintaining inter

103
00:07:23,055 --> 00:07:27,915
interoperability during incidents and
transparent reporting of any algorithmic

104
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:32,650
issues and demonstrating fairness
in service restoration priorities.

105
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,540
Let's look at like where traditional
incident response management

106
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,740
systems fail fall short, right?

107
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:43,450
Traditional incident and management
system often prioritizes system

108
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,670
recovery as quickly as possible.

109
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:50,600
And it fails to account for the intricate
regulatory requirement that fundamentally

110
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,430
alter incident response times.

111
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,500
So if you look at this picture, there
are like, areas like timeline conflicts

112
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,750
where regulatory deadlines rarely
align with the technical recovery

113
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,360
timelines and competing priorities.

114
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,610
Balancing immediate business
continuity with str strict regulatory

115
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,810
requirements bring conflicts.

116
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:15,600
And regulatory requirements bring
in a lot of documentation burdens,

117
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,000
which slows down the recovery time.

118
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:25,290
Along with the managing the stakeholder
complexity, the responders or

119
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:29,085
operators will have to navigate the
coordination between the legal and

120
00:08:29,085 --> 00:08:31,560
the complaints and the PR teams.

121
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:36,099
The regulatory requirements
also put data access limitations

122
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,939
which can hamper the recovery.

123
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:42,939
A lot of times the responders
need at least some.

124
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:47,739
Level of access to sensitive
production data before taking an

125
00:08:47,739 --> 00:08:52,589
action which conflicts with the
regulatory requirement to not expose

126
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:55,799
sensitive data to the responders.

127
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:58,189
Yeah, and just a quick recap.

128
00:08:58,239 --> 00:09:03,339
So far we looked at the different
regulations and the challenges

129
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:04,689
during system recovery.

130
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:09,989
Now we look at how to build a compliance
aware incident response framework.

131
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:14,659
So we can divide this compliance
aware response framework

132
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:15,979
into three different phase.

133
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:19,579
The first phase is the preparation
phase, followed by the recovery

134
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:21,844
response phase and the recovery phase.

135
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:25,964
So during the preparation phase we,
the framework should ensure that there

136
00:09:25,964 --> 00:09:31,164
are the pre pre-approved notification
templates and the complaints protocols

137
00:09:31,164 --> 00:09:36,544
in place, and ensure that the team
builds privacy, preserving investigation

138
00:09:36,544 --> 00:09:41,604
and analysis tools and identify
the regulatory requirement mapping.

139
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,669
During the response phase there
should be like parallel tracks

140
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:48,099
for compliance and mitigation.

141
00:09:48,729 --> 00:09:53,104
And then there should be tools in
place for regulatory triage assessment.

142
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:58,809
And along with the continuous
documentation protocols as well as

143
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:03,399
evidence preservation procedures
during the recovery phase ensure

144
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,599
that there are compliance recovery
compliance verification checkpoints.

145
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:12,309
The checkpoints should ensure
that all the data required for

146
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:14,319
complaints are collected in place.

147
00:10:14,349 --> 00:10:18,729
Ensure that the progressive
service restoration is in place.

148
00:10:19,229 --> 00:10:24,699
Now let's look about look at balancing
technical and regulatory priorities.

149
00:10:24,729 --> 00:10:27,339
The first part is called
documentation by design.

150
00:10:27,729 --> 00:10:32,089
Ensure that automated in evidence
collection is part of the

151
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,009
technical response workflows.

152
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:39,289
By ensuring that logs are collected
and auditing is in place, and ensure

153
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:43,039
there's a single source reporting
for multiple regulatory requirements.

154
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:48,689
The second aspect is called decision
frameworks utilize predefined criteria

155
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:54,209
for accurate regulatory classification
and implement automated notification

156
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:56,429
triggers based on impact thresholds.

157
00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:01,459
The third category is privacy preserving
analysis where we deploy different

158
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:06,749
initial privacy techniques for incident
investigations and implement data

159
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,179
minimization during law collection.

160
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:14,484
The next group is called Parallel Work
Streams, where there's like a dedicated

161
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:20,184
technical and compliance teams working
in tandem and establish synchronization

162
00:11:20,184 --> 00:11:22,344
checkpoints at critical junctures.

163
00:11:22,374 --> 00:11:26,624
The synchronization points shows
that the data is free flowing

164
00:11:26,624 --> 00:11:28,664
between the two parallel tracks.

165
00:11:28,744 --> 00:11:32,404
Now let's look at the communication
protocols for regulated incidents.

166
00:11:32,404 --> 00:11:36,454
The communication protocols can
be put into two broad categories.

167
00:11:36,454 --> 00:11:41,224
Internal communication and external
communications for internal communication

168
00:11:41,224 --> 00:11:46,984
ensure that their dedicated communication
POC is there on all technical calls.

169
00:11:47,064 --> 00:11:50,724
And there is a regular status
updates for the compliance offices.

170
00:11:51,219 --> 00:11:55,469
And ensure that there's illegal
checkpoints for external communication

171
00:11:55,989 --> 00:12:00,609
followed by protected communication
channels for sensitive discussions.

172
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:05,139
External communication is slightly
different from the internal communication.

173
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:09,094
Where there needs to be a
tiered communication framework

174
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:10,894
by the regulatory framework.

175
00:12:10,974 --> 00:12:14,004
And there should be a
regulatory authority.

176
00:12:14,104 --> 00:12:18,084
Liaison procedures external
communication also mandates a data

177
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:20,514
subject notification, coordination.

178
00:12:21,014 --> 00:12:24,744
Now let's look at implementing
a compliance aware monitoring.

179
00:12:24,794 --> 00:12:27,824
The first aspect is proactive
regulatory alerting.

180
00:12:28,234 --> 00:12:33,184
Ensure that the monitoring systems,
which is used to identify incidents

181
00:12:33,214 --> 00:12:37,444
are specifically designed to detect
compliance related incidents before

182
00:12:37,444 --> 00:12:39,514
they escalate into major breaches.

183
00:12:40,234 --> 00:12:45,884
The second aspect is personal data flow
tracking map and continuously monitor

184
00:12:45,884 --> 00:12:50,864
all systems, which is track which is
processing or tracking sensitive data.

185
00:12:51,364 --> 00:12:55,624
Ensuring heightened visibility into
data moments and access patterns.

186
00:12:56,194 --> 00:13:02,044
The last aspect is automated regulatory
timeline triggers establish automated

187
00:13:02,044 --> 00:13:07,924
notification for critical complex
deadlines triggered by the classification

188
00:13:07,924 --> 00:13:10,144
and progression of incident.

189
00:13:10,644 --> 00:13:14,414
Now let's look at the privacy
preserving incident analysis.

190
00:13:14,464 --> 00:13:18,804
The challenge is incident investigation
often require access to production

191
00:13:18,804 --> 00:13:23,854
data containing regulated information,
creating a compliance conflict.

192
00:13:24,594 --> 00:13:29,154
Investigators need data access to
assess the impact regulation risk.

193
00:13:29,204 --> 00:13:34,924
The flip side or the, from the regulation
aspect is that regulator regulators

194
00:13:34,984 --> 00:13:37,414
restrict access to sensitive informations.

195
00:13:37,914 --> 00:13:40,644
And they which in another word
is like evidence collection

196
00:13:40,644 --> 00:13:42,624
may violate data minimization.

197
00:13:43,224 --> 00:13:47,344
To meet these challenges, modern systems
have different technical solutions in

198
00:13:47,344 --> 00:13:53,444
place to give a specific example, AWS has
something called SSM system Manager, which

199
00:13:53,444 --> 00:14:00,374
is an automated tool to, for operators
to mitigate incidents while preserving

200
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:06,044
logs and auditing without direct access
to production systems by eliminating

201
00:14:06,044 --> 00:14:08,594
the direct access to production systems.

202
00:14:08,674 --> 00:14:13,824
Directly meets the regulatory mandate
by masking the production data from

203
00:14:13,824 --> 00:14:15,659
operators and oncology engineers.

204
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:20,389
Now let's look at building a complex
rare ready incident playbook, right?

205
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:22,609
This can be split into multiple group.

206
00:14:22,609 --> 00:14:27,049
The first one is map peer regulatory
landscape, right document, which

207
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:30,504
all regulations apply to your
domain and the systems in place.

208
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:36,909
And create their reference metrics for
notification requirements and deadlines.

209
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:42,349
And the second aspect is to integrate
with the compliance personnel and

210
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:46,999
designate a compliance lesson person
for incident teams and train technical

211
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:52,409
responders on regulatory implications
and develop documentation templates.

212
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:56,159
Create pre-approved notification
templates for each regulation.

213
00:14:56,844 --> 00:15:00,324
And implement standardized
evidence collection procedures.

214
00:15:01,194 --> 00:15:05,244
The next one is about establishing
a decision frameworks defend clear

215
00:15:05,244 --> 00:15:10,224
criteria for regulatory incident
classification and create decision tree

216
00:15:10,224 --> 00:15:12,634
for compliance related response actions.

217
00:15:13,054 --> 00:15:15,934
The last aspect is
practice combine scenarios.

218
00:15:15,934 --> 00:15:21,829
This is about creating a game day or a
mock testing for incidents involving.

219
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:27,854
Regulatory data the game day or mock
testing should ensure that the technical

220
00:15:27,854 --> 00:15:35,084
recovery is as quick as possible along
with preserving all the data auditing

221
00:15:35,204 --> 00:15:38,144
and logs needed for regulatory reporting.

222
00:15:38,644 --> 00:15:43,714
The game day should also test the
notification procedures and timelines

223
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:45,754
to meet the regulatory needs.

224
00:15:46,254 --> 00:15:51,134
The let's to wrap up, let's look at the
key takeaways from this presentation.

225
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:54,869
The first important takeaway
is integration is essential.

226
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:59,434
Seamlessly integrate technical and
compliance workflows from the tum,

227
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:03,689
from the outset rather than attempting
to retrofit from during a crisis.

228
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:09,169
This can be ensure by using
automated tools which can create

229
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:13,939
audit logs and eliminating
direct production system access.

230
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:18,024
The second important key
takeaway is the preparation.

231
00:16:18,074 --> 00:16:21,924
Preparation is key to enable
compliance thorough preparational

232
00:16:21,924 --> 00:16:25,794
laws organization to meet to
regulatory requirements effectively

233
00:16:25,794 --> 00:16:30,264
without compromising the agility of
their technical incident response.

234
00:16:30,764 --> 00:16:34,094
The last aspect is balance,
competing priorities.

235
00:16:34,544 --> 00:16:38,795
Achieving efficient incident
management and regulated environment

236
00:16:38,894 --> 00:16:42,554
relies on skillfully balancing
rapid technical recovery.

237
00:16:43,054 --> 00:16:47,284
With ongoing business continuity
and strict compliance obligations.

238
00:16:47,784 --> 00:16:50,304
I hope everyone found this talk useful.

239
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:53,324
Thank you for listening to this talk.
