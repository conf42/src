00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,680
Hi Al. Welcome everyone
to today's session.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,800
My name is David Kumar, a and I
have 20 plus years of experience

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,690
in information technology industry.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,840
I'm currently working as a senior lead
software engineer at Mini T Technologies,

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,490
where I lead software development
projects and mentor a team of software

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,000
to deliver a scalable and innovative.

7
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,644
Before joining Minis sot I worked
15 years at IBM and three years

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,850
with the Toyota Consulting Services.

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,489
Throughout my career, I have constantly
demonstrated strong problem solving

10
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,530
skills, a deep understanding of
software architecture, and passion for

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,765
leveraging technology to drive business.

12
00:00:51,974 --> 00:00:54,405
Today discussing.

13
00:00:55,035 --> 00:01:01,485
How the convergence of edge computing
machine learning and multi-cloud

14
00:01:01,785 --> 00:01:08,295
strategies is reshaping the
technological landscape and significantly

15
00:01:08,384 --> 00:01:12,134
enhancing enterprise on investment.

16
00:01:12,884 --> 00:01:17,804
This powerful intersection of
technologies is enabling business

17
00:01:17,804 --> 00:01:23,920
to process data closer to the
source, derive real time insights.

18
00:01:24,765 --> 00:01:29,384
Through intelligent algorithms
and leverage the flexibility of

19
00:01:29,865 --> 00:01:34,785
multi-cloud environments for optimized
performance and cost efficiency.

20
00:01:35,535 --> 00:01:41,354
Together, these innovations are not
only driving operational agility

21
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:47,414
and scalability, but are also
unlocking new revenue streams,

22
00:01:49,244 --> 00:01:51,764
improving customer experiences and.

23
00:01:53,595 --> 00:01:57,735
Data recommendations Making
across the enterprise.

24
00:01:58,455 --> 00:02:04,065
This session will highlight practical
examples and believer strategies you can

25
00:02:04,185 --> 00:02:09,585
implement across the following areas,
the convergence of edge computing,

26
00:02:09,585 --> 00:02:14,595
machine learning, business value
of edge machine learning, few case

27
00:02:14,595 --> 00:02:19,605
studies, healthcare, point of care,
analytics, and manufacturing maintenance.

28
00:02:21,195 --> 00:02:25,665
Workload placement at framework
implementation challenges and

29
00:02:25,665 --> 00:02:30,885
solutions, edge optimize remodel
architectures, multi-cloud integration

30
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:35,445
strategies, implementation roadmap,
key takeaways, and next steps.

31
00:02:37,965 --> 00:02:40,905
The convergence of edge
computing and machine learning.

32
00:02:41,415 --> 00:02:46,065
That's taught by comparing traditional
centralized machine learning with imaging

33
00:02:46,695 --> 00:02:48,970
paradigm of edge machine learning.

34
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:54,645
Centralized cloud processing
brings latency and bandwidth

35
00:02:54,705 --> 00:02:57,495
concerns, edge computing processes.

36
00:02:58,155 --> 00:03:03,135
Data closer to its sources on
the device are at the edge.

37
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:04,755
Edge.

38
00:03:04,755 --> 00:03:11,655
Machine learning further enables
real time AI interference directly

39
00:03:11,715 --> 00:03:18,615
on devices, multi-cloud support,
flexibility, distributing workload.

40
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,020
Intelligently across infrastructure,

41
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,370
business value of edge machine learning.

42
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,990
The benefits of Edge machine
learning are not just technical.

43
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,380
There are financial and operational.

44
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,470
We have seen up to 60%
maintenance cost reductions, 85%.

45
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,605
From 300 plus milliseconds
down to 14 milliseconds.

46
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,550
Most importantly, eight systems
remain functional even when

47
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,950
disconnected from the cloud

48
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,890
case studies.

49
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,785
We have a few case studies
we are going to discuss.

50
00:04:00,555 --> 00:04:01,690
First case study.

51
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,305
I'm gonna discuss healthcare
analytics, healthcare.

52
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,140
Patient data overwhelmed their network.

53
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:15,850
By deploying machine learning
at the edge real time vital

54
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,409
processing become possible.

55
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:22,689
Lightweight models were used
onsite and federated learning.

56
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,150
Ensure model improved
without centralizing.

57
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:32,439
Since two data, this will lead to
detection of critical events and.

58
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,119
We have another case study on
manufacturing predictive maintenance.

59
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:43,369
In predictive in manufacturing.

60
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:45,739
Unplanned downtime is costly.

61
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:52,069
This manufacturing, this manufacture
reduces maintenance cost by 60% with edge

62
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:59,509
based anomaly detection models run on
local factory sensors, detecting issues.

63
00:05:00,304 --> 00:05:05,195
Days before failure data from
edge loop back into the cloud

64
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:08,164
to refine models over time.

65
00:05:10,835 --> 00:05:13,325
Optional workload placement framework.

66
00:05:13,804 --> 00:05:16,265
Not all workload should be on the edge.

67
00:05:16,445 --> 00:05:21,840
This framework helps evaluate
placement if your system does

68
00:05:21,844 --> 00:05:26,794
not sub hundred milliseconds
response time edges the answer.

69
00:05:27,424 --> 00:05:28,924
Think about beta gravity.

70
00:05:29,164 --> 00:05:30,994
Process it where it generate.

71
00:05:31,924 --> 00:05:35,825
Consider privacy complaints
and compute needs.

72
00:05:36,184 --> 00:05:38,525
Often a hybrid model is ideal.

73
00:05:39,364 --> 00:05:43,114
Lightweight models on the edge,
heavy training on the cloud,

74
00:05:44,854 --> 00:05:46,799
implementation challenges and solutions.

75
00:05:47,854 --> 00:05:51,395
Machine learning deployment
isn't without challenges.

76
00:05:52,114 --> 00:05:52,624
We face

77
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:56,525
model update to logistic.

78
00:05:57,604 --> 00:06:02,164
Security concerns solutions
include automation learning that

79
00:06:02,314 --> 00:06:08,854
adapts to hardware containerized
deployment, and federated learning.

80
00:06:09,784 --> 00:06:13,325
Use differential updates and
version control to manage

81
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:15,200
model evaluation efficiently.

82
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:24,244
Edge optimiz model architectures edge
devices need compact efficient models.

83
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:31,144
Techniques like quantization, proning,
reduced size without closing the accuracy.

84
00:06:32,374 --> 00:06:35,704
Use architecture search
to find the right balance.

85
00:06:36,394 --> 00:06:42,669
Federated learning that trying
models across devices while

86
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,189
preserving data privacy.

87
00:06:46,609 --> 00:06:48,409
Multi-cloud integration strategies.

88
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:53,299
A robust edge machine learning strategy
requires a multi-cloud integration

89
00:06:53,749 --> 00:07:01,519
is abstraction, leads to unify APAs
and a wide vendor locking orchestrate

90
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:05,839
workload dynamically based on the
realtime performance and costs

91
00:07:06,739 --> 00:07:12,469
governance and devs pipelines ensure
smooth deployments from the edge to.

92
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:15,815
Implementation roadmap.

93
00:07:15,965 --> 00:07:20,945
Implementation begins with assessment,
define goals, use cases and metrics,

94
00:07:21,604 --> 00:07:27,424
build foundational tools and governance
as you scale, automate optimization and

95
00:07:27,424 --> 00:07:29,854
create culture of continuous improvement.

96
00:07:30,364 --> 00:07:35,435
This roadmap ensures consistent
consistency and sustainable.

97
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:38,505
Performance complaints, benefits.

98
00:07:39,255 --> 00:07:42,044
It's the best approach as
a distributed architecture.

99
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:45,554
Address technical hurdles
with optimized models.

100
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:46,844
Robust governance.

101
00:07:47,414 --> 00:07:53,114
Start with the high impact use case for
the value and scale confident confidently.

102
00:07:54,164 --> 00:07:54,734
Thank you.

103
00:07:55,065 --> 00:07:57,044
