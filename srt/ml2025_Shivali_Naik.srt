1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,130
This is the agenda.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:08,260
We'll go into artificial intelligence
introduction, AI revolution and

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:13,175
unstructured data, the tech stack for
ai, chat bots, and the future of ai.

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,630
So there are a lot of artificial
intelligence definitions out there,

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,430
but this is one of my favorites.

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,769
It says that artificial intelligence
is the ability of a machine to

7
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:32,800
perform tasks commonly associated with
intelligent beings, which means that

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,350
something that a human could do now, a
machine can do because you have given

9
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,090
it that ability to dig in and find
the right answers that it needs to.

10
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,410
This slide is very interesting.

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,720
It shows that artificial intelligence
isn't something new, right?

12
00:00:53,170 --> 00:01:00,120
It started when IPM developed this
computer and, it fought against

13
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,780
Gary Sparrow in 1997 against him
for this chess game, and this

14
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:13,679
computer played moves, which were
so amazing and never seen by any.

15
00:01:14,414 --> 00:01:17,445
Anyone or never played by
anyone, and that's why Gary

16
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:19,375
kis Farro couldn't defeat it.

17
00:01:19,915 --> 00:01:26,185
Then there were games which were developed
and these games had its own way of

18
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:33,165
learning and fine tuning itself to be
able to win all the points and and get

19
00:01:33,165 --> 00:01:35,745
whatever it wants to win the whole game.

20
00:01:36,285 --> 00:01:41,195
There were, social media and
Netflix and all had recommendations

21
00:01:41,195 --> 00:01:44,225
based on what you're watching,
it was gonna recommend you.

22
00:01:44,225 --> 00:01:44,555
Okay?

23
00:01:44,555 --> 00:01:46,115
This is what you can watch next.

24
00:01:46,385 --> 00:01:47,495
This is good for you.

25
00:01:47,495 --> 00:01:50,975
This content is something
you like or not like.

26
00:01:51,305 --> 00:01:56,795
That's like artificial intelligence has
been around us for a while and then came

27
00:01:56,795 --> 00:02:01,175
chat, GPD and it just took everyone away.

28
00:02:01,185 --> 00:02:06,564
Within five days, like you can
see the graph over here, there are

29
00:02:06,564 --> 00:02:11,154
these different applications and is
showing like within how many days

30
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:14,094
did it hit that 1 million user mark?

31
00:02:14,745 --> 00:02:16,154
And you can see chart.

32
00:02:16,154 --> 00:02:19,425
GPT did it within five
Ds, which is insane.

33
00:02:19,734 --> 00:02:25,224
When it did that, before that Instagram
did it in 2.5 months, the 1 million mark.

34
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:29,674
And then also there was thread
which came in and within one hour

35
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:32,404
it was hitting 1 million users.

36
00:02:32,404 --> 00:02:35,944
And within two hours I
think it did hit 2 million.

37
00:02:35,944 --> 00:02:39,964
But today we are not interested in
threads is definitely an entrusting

38
00:02:39,964 --> 00:02:42,214
applications for people who have used it.

39
00:02:42,214 --> 00:02:45,834
But chat, GPT has its own different.

40
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:52,344
Use case, which is not just a social
media tool like all these others,

41
00:02:52,344 --> 00:02:56,514
most of it you can see are more for
social media, entertainment purposes.

42
00:02:57,054 --> 00:03:00,564
But Cha g PD is very
much used by everyone.

43
00:03:00,654 --> 00:03:04,434
It be a researcher, may be someone
who's working in a corporate job

44
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:06,774
to make a jobs or lives easier.

45
00:03:06,774 --> 00:03:10,594
You are going to use this application.

46
00:03:12,364 --> 00:03:17,554
Next, we'll deep dig deeper into AI
revolution and unstructured data.

47
00:03:17,554 --> 00:03:20,764
Why did this whole AI
revolution come into picture?

48
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:27,784
Because 90% of your data is unstructured,
which means it is in the format of text,

49
00:03:27,784 --> 00:03:34,124
images, audio, video, and you want to
make sense out of this data because.

50
00:03:34,344 --> 00:03:35,454
Data is important.

51
00:03:35,604 --> 00:03:41,664
Any data you give someone, there is a way
to make analysis, predict future, and come

52
00:03:41,664 --> 00:03:44,279
up with some better solution that can.

53
00:03:45,594 --> 00:03:49,184
That you cannot, where if you don't
have that data, you can't analyze it.

54
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:54,974
So tradi traditional database struggle to
process this unstructured data, and that's

55
00:03:54,974 --> 00:03:56,864
where generative AI comes into picture.

56
00:03:56,894 --> 00:04:03,894
It goes in, finds the whole scenario or
what is happening in your data, gives you

57
00:04:03,894 --> 00:04:06,564
the result and extracts value for you.

58
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,099
What is generative ai?

59
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:14,229
Generative AI is AI models that
generate text images or insights.

60
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:17,679
The examples are GBD four LAMA Cloud.

61
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:19,309
Why is it powerful?

62
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,719
Because it's humanlike.

63
00:04:20,929 --> 00:04:25,429
The responses and summarizations
are amazing that you.

64
00:04:25,604 --> 00:04:29,655
Even if a human had to dig into
so much like unstructured data and

65
00:04:29,655 --> 00:04:31,604
bring it, it's was gonna be harder.

66
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:37,694
So someone who can do this for you without
any man, manual intervention is amazing.

67
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,634
Understanding your unstructured data.

68
00:04:39,694 --> 00:04:42,724
There is a lot of unstructured
data out there and all these

69
00:04:42,724 --> 00:04:44,404
things that you see on the screen.

70
00:04:44,914 --> 00:04:48,405
Videos, images audio texts fall under it.

71
00:04:48,854 --> 00:04:52,895
The types are also varied,
like email, chat logs clinical

72
00:04:52,895 --> 00:04:54,424
notes, pathologic reports.

73
00:04:55,034 --> 00:04:56,835
All of them fall down structured data.

74
00:04:56,835 --> 00:04:59,540
And if you wanna make sense of it you can.

75
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,970
So why is it hard to process?

76
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,700
No predefined schema or structured.

77
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,950
That is why it is hard, because
if there was a proper table and

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,440
you had like your columns into it,
you could write a simple select.

79
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,570
S statement or write like a procedure
and do the whole data science or

80
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:25,660
python analysis on it and predict
the, what the data was bringing you.

81
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,260
But with this, it becomes difficult
because there is no structure.

82
00:05:30,315 --> 00:05:32,655
How Gen AI processes it is.

83
00:05:33,075 --> 00:05:37,215
It has the natural language
processing for text understanding.

84
00:05:37,665 --> 00:05:40,965
It has summarization and
document classification.

85
00:05:41,085 --> 00:05:45,705
It has con conversational AI for
chatbots feature, and then it

86
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:47,775
has rag and vectors and chalk.

87
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:54,170
So what this whole side means, it, the
gen AI has those specific capabilities.

88
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,950
Like it has those necessary functions
which can summarize your whole

89
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:03,870
essays, big, long paragraphs and
pages of essays into something small.

90
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,760
It has, that conversational ability.

91
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,540
So if you ask it a question and ask
it a counter question on the first

92
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,400
question, it remembers the first
question and gives you the answer or

93
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,800
the context of the answer accordingly.

94
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,060
There is rag.

95
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,560
Rag is a very amazing feature wherein
your data, unstructured data is

96
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,840
divided into chunks and it is given
that specific, unique identifier for

97
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,480
it to be able to identify later on.

98
00:06:32,205 --> 00:06:37,224
So overall, all these things make
reduce the administrative burden,

99
00:06:37,254 --> 00:06:41,335
enhance data driven decision making
for you, and that's how generative

100
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,525
AI processes your unstructured data.

101
00:06:44,455 --> 00:06:47,174
The role of gen AI is twofold.

102
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:52,575
The traditional one was very predefined,
no learning and limited, whereas

103
00:06:52,664 --> 00:06:55,125
AI power chat bot is context aware.

104
00:06:55,484 --> 00:07:00,124
It is very much self-improving via,
data and highly conversational.

105
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,370
The tech stack.

106
00:07:02,429 --> 00:07:08,470
This is my short and suite, I would
say like architecture diagram that you

107
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:13,130
can see wherein your whole flow of the.

108
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,410
Chat bot experience, you can see
over your, so the first thing,

109
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,850
it starts with a question.

110
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,250
This question gets the embedding.

111
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,330
Embedding is a specific, unique
identifier for your question based

112
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,710
on what question you're asking.

113
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,430
This embedding is then going and
searching in your vector data.

114
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:33,150
And this vector data, again,
is stored into embedding.

115
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,730
So like I was mentioning,
your data, the rag.

116
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:40,370
Chunks your whatever files and all
you have into specific embeddings

117
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,320
and stores it into vector database.

118
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,335
And whenever a match is found
between this embedding and this em

119
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,450
embedding, that relevant chunk is
returned and there is some engineering

120
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:55,550
done to make it look beautiful
and then returned to the end user.

121
00:07:56,525 --> 00:07:57,755
So that's the tech stack.

122
00:07:57,755 --> 00:07:59,465
You need a large language model.

123
00:07:59,465 --> 00:08:01,175
You need an embedding database.

124
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:05,525
There's some vector search functions
you need to apply to be able to search.

125
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:08,855
And then the framework, which
is more of the UI piece.

126
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,105
You can do it a stream
data app or something.

127
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,675
So you can combine the both
UI and the backend to it.

128
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:21,305
Here is an example of a chat
bot that I built myself.

129
00:08:21,395 --> 00:08:22,055
So what.

130
00:08:22,594 --> 00:08:28,254
I did was I had this whole a whole stage
wherein I had different PDFs in it.

131
00:08:28,314 --> 00:08:32,694
One of them was my resume and I
wanted to ask question on my resume.

132
00:08:32,754 --> 00:08:33,834
So that's what I did.

133
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:38,874
And the chunk, I did the function for
that I created like a whole vector

134
00:08:38,874 --> 00:08:41,814
database, stored my chunks into it.

135
00:08:42,144 --> 00:08:46,864
And also called my, for call this
function to get the relevant chunk,

136
00:08:46,924 --> 00:08:49,684
then did a getcha history function.

137
00:08:50,054 --> 00:08:54,914
Summarize questions with history
was used to remember the context

138
00:08:54,914 --> 00:08:56,804
of the previous questions.

139
00:08:57,194 --> 00:09:01,394
Complete function and prompt function
was used to make the answer more better.

140
00:09:01,994 --> 00:09:05,294
So these are the couple of function
and the whole script and the UI

141
00:09:05,654 --> 00:09:07,364
piece of it for the chat bot.

142
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:11,429
So building chatbot step by step.

143
00:09:11,489 --> 00:09:11,939
Definitely.

144
00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:16,349
We saw the whole flow and how chatbot
can we build, but there is a little

145
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:20,129
bit of pre-processing and fine
tuning piece to it as well, right?

146
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:21,599
Like you cannot just build it.

147
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:22,559
And that's about it.

148
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,409
The pre-processing comes
with data ingestion.

149
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:29,129
So you definitely have to collect like
all types of data from different sources,

150
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:34,499
bring it in a proper stage, location, do
some data processing and transformation

151
00:09:34,499 --> 00:09:39,609
on it because, so there is definitely
gonna be some special characters which

152
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:42,399
are gonna throw your s Python script away.

153
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:46,809
So make sure you remove those
special characters and then

154
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:48,539
build a model on top of it.

155
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,129
For that bot model.

156
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:51,959
You'll need like an LLM rack.

157
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:55,139
There'll be some fine tuning and
testing you'll have to do because

158
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:56,894
once you've built it, the first.

159
00:09:57,634 --> 00:10:02,514
Three to six months is training
period, and there are questions being

160
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:05,694
asked by different users, is still
trying to understand what is the

161
00:10:05,694 --> 00:10:10,734
question and context and trying to
make sense out of your data for you.

162
00:10:11,184 --> 00:10:15,124
And then finally you'll deploy and
monitor and give it to like the

163
00:10:15,124 --> 00:10:17,884
specific end users that you want to.

164
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,609
The case studies for industry
applications are unlimited.

165
00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:27,949
There is no limit where you
can use chat bots, right?

166
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:33,649
From customer support patient q and
a, contract analysis, policy bots.

167
00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:38,089
There, there are like finance bots
available to, for fraud detection and all.

168
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:44,159
So any industry, if you have
those unstructured data and you

169
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,014
want to make sense out of it.

170
00:10:46,324 --> 00:10:48,574
It is possible with your chat bot.

171
00:10:49,684 --> 00:10:52,114
Next steps to adopt chat gen ai.

172
00:10:52,684 --> 00:10:56,464
I would say if you are trying to build
an application, definitely start with.

173
00:10:56,894 --> 00:10:57,674
Start slow.

174
00:10:57,674 --> 00:11:02,744
Start with the crawl phase wherein you
are bringing all your applications data,

175
00:11:03,104 --> 00:11:08,594
you are storing it in a stage, trying
to do the cleansing on it, running

176
00:11:08,594 --> 00:11:12,854
some scripts to do the chunking and
vectoring of your database and all that.

177
00:11:13,074 --> 00:11:15,714
So that's like the first
crawl phase for you.

178
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:19,374
Then comes the walk phase wherein
you're building the whole decision

179
00:11:19,374 --> 00:11:25,074
engine and you are deciding, okay,
if, what are the key parameters which

180
00:11:25,074 --> 00:11:29,124
you would want to track or which the
users are gonna ask questions on.

181
00:11:29,494 --> 00:11:33,809
How are you gonna understand okay,
if this is answered, it is a good.

182
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:37,479
Answer versus if this is answer
is the wrong, bad answer.

183
00:11:37,869 --> 00:11:40,369
Those decision engines is the next phase.

184
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:45,709
And then finally, you are gonna deploy
it and put it out there for everyone

185
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:48,934
to use and see how the changes happen.

186
00:11:49,614 --> 00:11:55,219
I. Also there are a lot of features
wherein the user can give feedback.

187
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:59,079
There are like plus thumbs up and
thumbs down features that you see

188
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:01,659
in different chat bots out there.

189
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:05,799
You can incorporate those so that
your model understand, okay, this was

190
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:10,539
a negative answer, and next time it,
it makes sure what are the positive

191
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:13,869
answers and brings you answers based
on that, rather than giving you the

192
00:12:13,869 --> 00:12:15,849
negative ones or the wrong ones.

193
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:21,964
The future of AI Chat Botts we are
definitely in the tip of AI chat

194
00:12:21,964 --> 00:12:23,644
Botts, and there is so much more.

195
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:28,114
There are multimodal chat botts, which
is voice and text related chatbots.

196
00:12:28,204 --> 00:12:31,624
Combined, there is autonomous AI agents.

197
00:12:31,624 --> 00:12:35,579
So here you can see there
was we trip booking.

198
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:37,139
I asked.

199
00:12:38,114 --> 00:12:45,294
The GPT four, it went in the high camp
website, brought in the best deal for

200
00:12:45,294 --> 00:12:50,964
me based on what dates I'd given it, and
then told me this is like the best deal.

201
00:12:50,964 --> 00:12:52,644
It has 95% rating.

202
00:12:52,644 --> 00:12:53,664
Would you like to book it?

203
00:12:53,664 --> 00:12:56,574
And if I say book it, it's gonna
go ahead and book it for me.

204
00:12:56,574 --> 00:12:58,164
So that's what an agent take.

205
00:12:58,554 --> 00:12:59,484
AI would do it.

206
00:12:59,484 --> 00:13:00,114
Will you just.

207
00:13:00,734 --> 00:13:03,824
Have to type your questions
in your chat words.

208
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,734
This is gonna go in the specific
website, bring the answer for

209
00:13:06,734 --> 00:13:09,464
you, and you are good to go.

210
00:13:09,464 --> 00:13:12,074
Then there are AI powered workflows.

211
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:16,424
So a lot of manual processes
are going to be replaced by ai.

212
00:13:16,424 --> 00:13:22,814
So right from your data engineering step
ingestion or the whole like data cloud

213
00:13:22,814 --> 00:13:28,654
framework, building the whole, a raw gold
and silver layer, the scripts will do it

214
00:13:28,654 --> 00:13:31,634
for you without any manual intervention.

215
00:13:31,634 --> 00:13:36,774
So those those like startup ideas
are out there already and people

216
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,544
are working on it and building it.

217
00:13:39,384 --> 00:13:43,014
And then there is gonna be a lot of
AI governance and safety measures

218
00:13:43,074 --> 00:13:45,354
that are gonna be built out there.

219
00:13:45,354 --> 00:13:51,254
So even like companies who are very
unsure about the usage of AI can securely.

220
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:56,109
Use AI under the whole governance
and framework and stuff.

221
00:13:57,109 --> 00:14:00,519
Next is we'll see what will the future be.

222
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:04,989
So I'm gonna leave you guys with
this final slide, which is showing

223
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:06,729
two different perspectives.

224
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:14,149
One is a human from the wall e
movie which had nothing to do and

225
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:16,279
grow weaker and weaker over time.

226
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:20,479
Versus on the other hand,
there is this whole new phase

227
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:22,639
of discovery that we did with.

228
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:28,329
The AI revolution and we built amazing
products and amazing solutions.

229
00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:29,769
So it's in our hands.

230
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:34,239
Are we gonna be this side or that side?

231
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:42,149
And I feel like use AI and chat bots
to your best use so that you can

232
00:14:42,689 --> 00:14:47,369
do something which has not yet been
discovered and discover amazing things.

233
00:14:47,909 --> 00:14:48,479
Thank you.
