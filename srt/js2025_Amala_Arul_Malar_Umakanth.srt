00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,250
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:02,990
I'm Amala Han.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,830
I work as a principal data engineer
at a management consulting firm.

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,850
I have over a decade of experience
in leading the data architecture

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,360
and digital transformations,
building scalable and robust data

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,040
pipelines at an enterprise scale.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,690
Thank you for joining with me Today we
are going to talk about how generative

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,830
AI is reshaping the healthcare
insurance workflows, particularly in

9
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,720
claims processing and fraud detection.

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,420
This is a space undergoing massive
transformation, and gene AI opens

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,290
a door to possibilities we couldn't
reach with traditional automation.

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,019
Let's dive into the topic to begin
with, let's start our problem.

13
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,739
The healthcare ecosystem is massive.

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,660
Tens of millions of claims are
submitted, reviewed, processed and

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,800
cleared every day across several payers,
providers, and insurance companies.

16
00:00:53,459 --> 00:00:55,919
Claims processing are
still heavily manual.

17
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,629
People reading clinical notes, checking
codes, line by line, and the data.

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,149
It's everywhere, like
in papers and portals.

19
00:01:03,209 --> 00:01:06,869
EHR systems attachments that
does not talk to each other.

20
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,789
Fraud detection is also based on rigid
rules that don't evolve fast enough.

21
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,149
All these issues cost the
healthcare industry over a

22
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:16,770
hundred billion dollars annually.

23
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:19,664
Combine all that with other
regulations every year.

24
00:01:20,325 --> 00:01:24,825
We have hit a point where complexity
is outpacing the human capacity.

25
00:01:25,695 --> 00:01:29,715
We need a technology that can
understand the context, learn the

26
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:33,225
patterns, and scale, and that's
where Genea comes into picture.

27
00:01:33,725 --> 00:01:37,325
Genea is revolutionizing the
healthcare industry by establishing

28
00:01:37,325 --> 00:01:41,375
scalable, secure data architectures
and EA models that power the

29
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:42,845
clinical and operational advances.

30
00:01:43,385 --> 00:01:46,535
They also enable transformative
claim processing by automating the

31
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:50,015
complex adjudication processes,
reducing manual errors, and

32
00:01:50,015 --> 00:01:51,485
accelerating the payment cycles.

33
00:01:51,965 --> 00:01:56,315
Advanced gene AI models strengthen the
fraud detection through patent analysis,

34
00:01:56,315 --> 00:02:00,815
anomaly identifications, and predictive
alert on suspicious claims driving

35
00:02:00,815 --> 00:02:02,765
cost containment, and system integrity.

36
00:02:03,245 --> 00:02:06,815
Responsible AI implementation also
ensures that gene AI deployments

37
00:02:06,815 --> 00:02:10,115
are transparent, fair, and
compliant with ethical standards.

38
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,400
Supporting trust and
accountability in care delivery.

39
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,260
In practical terms, gen I tools are
already enhancing productivity and

40
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:24,170
outcomes across care continent driving
measurable improvements in efficiency,

41
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,030
accuracy, and patient experience.

42
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,770
This isn't just efficiency, it's a
reinvention of how insurers operate.

43
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,080
To make Janea Ashley useful inside
an organization, it needs structure.

44
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:40,285
This five layer architecture brings order
to the kiosk, the data ingestion layer.

45
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:45,235
This is where we ingest the data and
pre-process them, and then we understand

46
00:02:45,235 --> 00:02:49,495
the clinical language, leveraging
the natural language processing and

47
00:02:49,495 --> 00:02:53,245
validates it with medical standards,
make intelligent decisions and

48
00:02:53,245 --> 00:02:54,745
automate the workflows end to end.

49
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:58,405
This is how we get intelligence
into the operational core.

50
00:02:58,915 --> 00:03:00,325
Let's look at each one closely.

51
00:03:00,825 --> 00:03:03,015
The first layer is the data
ingestion and pre-processing.

52
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,440
The biggest barrier in any data
pipeline is a data fragmentation.

53
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,990
Claims come in several formats, like
PDFs, hhl seven messages, or even DCOM

54
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:18,840
messages, images, generic consumes data
in all of these formats and converts into

55
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,090
structured data for downstream processing.

56
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,100
The ingestion pipeline performs
data cleaning, d deduplication,

57
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,750
and enrichment as part of the data.

58
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,890
Pre-processing steps.

59
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,860
Think of it as laying a solid foundation.

60
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,110
Without clean unified data, no AI
models can deliver reliable outcomes.

61
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:41,670
Once it, once we have the clean data,
the next challenge is understanding

62
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,530
what that data actually means.

63
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,600
That's where the NLP takes over.

64
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,060
Many of us would've heard or even seen
medical data, and it's not simple text.

65
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:54,440
It's full of medical codes, aggravations
context, and clinical nuances.

66
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,900
This second layer leverages the
NLP to extract meaning from these

67
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,470
codes and a observations gene I
reads, physician notes, discharge

68
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,120
summaries, and claim negatives.

69
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:10,880
Then it identifies entities like diagnosis
codes, procedures, and medications.

70
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,260
It doesn't stop there.

71
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,840
It goes on to build
contextual understanding.

72
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,040
For example, it can distinguish
between a follow-up visit for diabetes

73
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,260
versus a new diagnosis of diabetes.

74
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,830
There is a subtle difference that
affects the building accuracy,

75
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,180
and the result is a claim that's
enriched with semantic intelligence

76
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,280
ready for automated de positioning.

77
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,890
These remaining layers focuses on
validating the correctness, which means

78
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:40,120
the goal here is not to reject the bad
claims, to improve the equality before it,

79
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,650
before the submissions, and then detecting
risks and automating the smart routing.

80
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,700
The final orchestration layer ties
the entire ecosystem together.

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,570
Claims that are high, confidence
can auto approve and questionable

82
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,650
claims get escalated.

83
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,000
Humans focus, humans can focus where
human judgment is needed and everything

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,970
becomes faster and more consistent when
it comes to processing the medical claims.

85
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,020
Transforming this process with
gene AI in healthcare is a game

86
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,760
changer for day-to-day operations.

87
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,920
By using a advanced AI models to
read, understand, and automate claims

88
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,090
documentation, healthcare organizations
can dramatically cut down on manual

89
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:23,010
paperwork, streamline the approvals, and
reduce errors that often slow things down.

90
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,110
Gena also helps spot inconsistencies
or missing information instantly

91
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,640
flagging claims that need attention and
freeing up the staff to focus on cases

92
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,680
that really require human judgment.

93
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,500
This means claims get
processed much faster.

94
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,600
Sometimes in minutes instead of days
leading to quicker reimbursements for

95
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,970
providers and less waiting for patients.

96
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,190
On top of that, AI driven automation
brings transparency and removes the

97
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,540
guesswork from the whole process.

98
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,100
Teams gain better visibility into claim
status, bottlenecks and operational

99
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,330
metrics, allowing for smarter resource
allocation and continuous improvement.

100
00:05:59,745 --> 00:06:04,695
In short, Genea delivers significant
efficiency gains that save costs, boost

101
00:06:04,695 --> 00:06:08,955
productivity, and enhance satisfaction
across the board for the patients

102
00:06:08,955 --> 00:06:11,085
healthcare workers and payers, all alike.

103
00:06:11,585 --> 00:06:13,775
Now, let's talk about the
real differentiator, the fraud

104
00:06:13,775 --> 00:06:17,525
detection, how fraudulent claims
are captured in traditional systems.

105
00:06:18,015 --> 00:06:21,675
The answers to this question depends
on codified static business rules

106
00:06:21,855 --> 00:06:23,265
that capture the thresholds like.

107
00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:27,135
Flag the claim if an amount
is greater than X dollars or

108
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:28,905
duplicate claims within 30 days.

109
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:33,015
However, frauds evolve so quickly,
often just likely changing

110
00:06:33,015 --> 00:06:34,605
patterns to bypass those frauds.

111
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,605
January brings multimodal analysis.

112
00:06:37,635 --> 00:06:42,135
This means it combines the structured
data, claim narratives, and behavioral

113
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:48,075
signals simultaneously in order to detect
the suspicious activity proactively by

114
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,145
integrating these different data types.

115
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,610
The system gains a more
comprehensive understanding than

116
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,350
any single source could provide.

117
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,330
Leading to more accurate and
efficient claims education, it

118
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,930
can identify sophisticated fraud
patterns even before human auditors.

119
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,830
Notice them and send notifications
to the right personnel to act upon.

120
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,240
For example, the most complex and hard
to detect patterns are often buried

121
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,600
in structured data, unstructured
data such as clinical nodes, doctor's

122
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,370
letters, and claim description.

123
00:07:17,135 --> 00:07:20,615
NLP could actually reveal a hidden
pattern in these unstructured data.

124
00:07:21,115 --> 00:07:25,224
Multimodal fraud detection in healthcare
is getting a major upgrade thanks to the

125
00:07:25,224 --> 00:07:29,635
advanced AI techniques that pull insights
from different kinds of data to spot

126
00:07:29,635 --> 00:07:31,825
suspicious activities more accurately.

127
00:07:32,455 --> 00:07:36,625
With graph neural networks, the system
maps out the relationships among claims

128
00:07:36,865 --> 00:07:38,965
patients, providers and transactions.

129
00:07:39,489 --> 00:07:42,129
Think of it like building a
social network for claims data.

130
00:07:42,489 --> 00:07:46,539
If certain providers, for example,
are unusually connected to clusters

131
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:50,770
of questionable claims, the network
highlights those as red flags right away.

132
00:07:51,549 --> 00:07:55,179
In temporal pattern analysis is all
about watching for the odd timing

133
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:59,590
the AI looks at when procedures,
prescriptions, or billing events happen

134
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,789
and can quickly spot if someone's
submitting claims and patterns.

135
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:07,914
They just don't make sense, like
frequent charges at strange hours

136
00:08:08,124 --> 00:08:11,514
or burst of identical procedure,
which is a classic sign of fraud.

137
00:08:12,234 --> 00:08:17,695
Document Authenticity assessment goes
further by letting AI review paperwork,

138
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:22,465
invoices, and digital documents
for signs of tampering or forgery.

139
00:08:23,244 --> 00:08:27,864
Gene AI can detect subtle differences
in wordings, formatting, or signatures,

140
00:08:28,104 --> 00:08:32,754
alerting the investigators to documents
that look doctored or generated by bots

141
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:34,914
instead of genuine human submissions.

142
00:08:35,605 --> 00:08:39,474
Last but not the least, anomalies,
scoring models, crunch all

143
00:08:39,474 --> 00:08:41,155
these clues and assign risks.

144
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:46,869
To each claim on transaction when claims
stand out statistically, whether due to

145
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:52,030
the networks timing or document content,
the system prioritizes them for review.

146
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,020
Ensuring team tackles truly
suspicious activity first and don't

147
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,670
get bogged down by false alarms.

148
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,709
Together with these techniques,
meet faster, smarter, and more

149
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:02,879
comprehensive fraud detection.

150
00:09:03,614 --> 00:09:08,204
Making it much harder for bad actors
to slip through the cracks and helping

151
00:09:08,204 --> 00:09:11,924
healthcare organizations protect
their resources and patient's trust.

152
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:16,454
This gives insurers a 360 degree
defensive shield against fraud.

153
00:09:16,954 --> 00:09:17,794
I love this one.

154
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:22,354
The synthetic fraud scenario
generation AI can create water fraud

155
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,029
scenarios that haven't happened.

156
00:09:23,824 --> 00:09:26,134
This lets insurers train their systems.

157
00:09:26,254 --> 00:09:30,334
Before a new tactic shows up
in production, we move from

158
00:09:30,364 --> 00:09:32,614
reactive to predictive defense.

159
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,494
Here it's like having a
heads up on future fraud.

160
00:09:35,944 --> 00:09:39,694
Using generative modeling, we
can simulate fraudulent claims to

161
00:09:39,694 --> 00:09:43,415
stress test the detection pipeline
to protect against future threats.

162
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:47,014
This approach helps the system to
learn from possible future fraud

163
00:09:47,014 --> 00:09:50,734
events even before it occurs,
thereby improving their resilience,

164
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:53,014
adaptability, and system integrity.

165
00:09:53,514 --> 00:09:57,684
Talking about responsible AI in
healthcare, accuracy is important,

166
00:09:57,684 --> 00:10:01,554
but trust is essential and
responsible AI is not optional.

167
00:10:01,614 --> 00:10:03,474
It is the foundation of adoption.

168
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:09,174
We must keep all the personal information,
the PHI information private and we

169
00:10:09,174 --> 00:10:11,124
need to explain the decisions clearly.

170
00:10:11,274 --> 00:10:15,024
We need to monitor for biases, and
we also need to comply with the

171
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,094
HIPAA and other audit requirements.

172
00:10:17,904 --> 00:10:22,854
Explainability is equally essential
decision makers and patients should

173
00:10:22,854 --> 00:10:27,564
be able to understand how AI reached
its conclusions, whether about claims

174
00:10:27,564 --> 00:10:29,964
denial, or risk ratings or fraud alerts.

175
00:10:30,354 --> 00:10:35,154
Responsible AI frameworks encourages
transparency, feature important analysis,

176
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:40,104
and ongoing testing so that any biases
are supported and corrected by com.

177
00:10:40,404 --> 00:10:44,064
By combining the compliance
and explainability insurers,

178
00:10:44,064 --> 00:10:45,804
build trust and accountability.

179
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:50,229
Which strengthens the relationship with
your customers and support better fairer

180
00:10:50,229 --> 00:10:51,669
outcomes in the healthcare sector.

181
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:56,459
Organizations in healthcare face big
hurdles when rolling out ai, especially

182
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,049
when it comes to data fragmentation.

183
00:10:58,334 --> 00:11:01,844
Keeping models up to date and
helping the workflow adapt.

184
00:11:02,054 --> 00:11:05,564
New technologies, it's not about
just technology, it's people,

185
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:10,754
process and change data silos,
workflows, readiness, and model drift.

186
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,494
All of these require strategy.

187
00:11:13,394 --> 00:11:15,404
Data fragmentation is a classic challenge.

188
00:11:15,854 --> 00:11:20,144
Health information is scattered across
electronic health records, insurance,

189
00:11:20,144 --> 00:11:22,659
databases, labs, and even old paper files.

190
00:11:23,624 --> 00:11:27,344
This makes it tricky for AI
systems to get a complete picture,

191
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:31,874
potentially missing important
signals or even causing redundancies.

192
00:11:32,264 --> 00:11:36,494
The solution, investing in secure
data integration platforms and

193
00:11:36,494 --> 00:11:40,544
robust interoperability standards
so that different systems can talk

194
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:44,754
to each other, and AI has one clean,
unified data source to work from.

195
00:11:45,254 --> 00:11:47,084
Model maintenance is another roadblock.

196
00:11:47,654 --> 00:11:52,454
AI models need regular updates to
stay accurate as new diseases emerge.

197
00:11:52,604 --> 00:11:57,134
Regulations change or patient
populations shift, many organizations

198
00:11:57,134 --> 00:12:00,404
struggle to set up automated
monitoring and retraining pipelines.

199
00:12:00,795 --> 00:12:05,444
The best fix is to build strong ML
ops team and use continuous monitoring

200
00:12:05,444 --> 00:12:10,754
tools, making sure models are retrained
with fresh data, evaluated for biases

201
00:12:10,754 --> 00:12:12,284
and version for accountability.

202
00:12:13,214 --> 00:12:15,014
Then there's workforce transformation.

203
00:12:15,374 --> 00:12:20,324
Staff needs training and support
to trust what AI is doing and uses.

204
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:26,024
It uses its results effectively, but
fear of job loss or lack of technical

205
00:12:26,024 --> 00:12:30,194
skills can cause resistance the
way forward is ongoing Education.

206
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:35,909
Change management and bringing clinical,
operational and tech teams together so

207
00:12:35,909 --> 00:12:37,859
everyone's included in the AI journey.

208
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,329
Upskilling programs and transparent
communication make the workplace

209
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:44,099
more resilient and ready for future.

210
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:49,019
By tackling these challenges head on
healthcare organizations can unlock more

211
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:53,300
value from ai, improving the healthcare,
and empower their teams for what's next

212
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,865
when implementing the AI roadmap.

213
00:12:56,365 --> 00:12:59,005
Jena in healthcare insure
space, breaking the journey

214
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:00,895
down into four easy step phases.

215
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:02,725
The first phase is a foundation.

216
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,915
Think of this as laying the groundwork.

217
00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:09,385
Teams focus on setting up secure
pipelines for collecting and handling

218
00:13:09,385 --> 00:13:13,195
data, picking and configuring the
natural language processing models,

219
00:13:13,495 --> 00:13:17,365
and building initial validation
frameworks to make sure everything runs

220
00:13:17,365 --> 00:13:18,830
according to existing business rules.

221
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:22,830
The next phase developers get fraud
detection models up and running.

222
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,560
But start in shadow mode, managing the
models alongside the current systems, not

223
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,170
replacing them existing ones just yet.

224
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:37,390
This phase also involves creating helpful
explainability tools for claim adjusters

225
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,610
and setting up AB testing infrastructure.

226
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,470
So model performance can be accurately
evaluated in the integration phase.

227
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,740
Gene systems are connected
to core insurance platforms.

228
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:51,505
Workflow orchestration gets
attention with automated routing

229
00:13:51,505 --> 00:13:53,455
and escalation for claims processes.

230
00:13:53,755 --> 00:13:58,075
Monitoring dashboards are also introduced,
so stakeholders have visibility into

231
00:13:58,075 --> 00:14:01,585
the key metrics and can keep an eye
on model performance in real time.

232
00:14:02,245 --> 00:14:06,745
In the optimization phase, the focus
shifts to continuous improvement.

233
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:10,645
This includes building pipelines
for ongoing learning, expanding

234
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:12,355
AI coverage to more claim types.

235
00:14:12,715 --> 00:14:16,975
Boosting capacity for handling more
claims and crafting advanced features

236
00:14:16,975 --> 00:14:21,175
like synthetic fraud generations and
federated learning to make the systems

237
00:14:21,175 --> 00:14:22,825
smarter and more robust for the future.

238
00:14:23,635 --> 00:14:27,235
This roadmaps makes complex AI
implementation feel manageable by

239
00:14:27,235 --> 00:14:31,225
breaking it down into stage by stage
priorities, ensuring progress is

240
00:14:31,225 --> 00:14:34,870
measured, and teams know exactly what
to tackle next as they move forward.

241
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,600
So here's the big picture.

242
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:41,820
Healthcare insurance is entering a
new AI era and is incredibly exciting.

243
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,780
Here are the main takeaways and
practical steps for leveraging the gene

244
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,550
AI in healthcare insurance context.

245
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,050
All in a clear and structured way.

246
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,760
Architectural thinking genea
isn't about algorithms.

247
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,560
It starts with a solid foundation.

248
00:14:55,085 --> 00:14:58,565
Five layer architecture that we talked
about ensures a structured rollout,

249
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:02,675
balancing cutting edge innovation with
all important regulatory requirements

250
00:15:02,915 --> 00:15:06,835
that keep data safe and systems
in check and beyond automation.

251
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:09,055
Gen A goes way beyond that.

252
00:15:09,555 --> 00:15:13,125
It brings new capabilities to the
table, like improving fraud detection,

253
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:17,295
risk assessment, and making smarter
decisions, all things that move business

254
00:15:17,295 --> 00:15:22,535
forward and add major value and success
with AI means doing things ethically.

255
00:15:23,035 --> 00:15:27,895
That means focusing on explainability,
protecting privacy, minimizing

256
00:15:27,895 --> 00:15:30,745
bias, and staying compliant with
all relevant laws and standards.

257
00:15:31,245 --> 00:15:34,215
To really see the benefits,
the organization should also

258
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:35,925
start small and focused.

259
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:40,935
Pick use cases that they can show clear
incremental value, then build up bigger

260
00:15:40,935 --> 00:15:46,125
technical capabilities as expertise
and their confidence grow altogether.

261
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:50,235
These points offer a roadmap for
organizations work, wanting to make

262
00:15:50,505 --> 00:15:53,985
GI work for them in the responsible,
effective, and forward thinking way.

263
00:15:54,485 --> 00:15:57,435
Thank you so much for your time
and let's together explore and

264
00:15:57,435 --> 00:16:00,915
experience the advancement of
technology for the good cause.

265
00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:02,325
Have a good one.
