00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,220
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,750
I'm Shika Kamp.

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:08,090
Welcome to the Site Reliability
Engineering Conference of 2025.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,840
Today we are gonna discuss about
transforming monolithic SaaS,

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,940
the serverless evolution on AWS.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,760
Welcome to our comprehensive exploration
of serverless migration strategies

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,190
for SaaS applications using AWS.

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,310
This presentation will guide you
through the journey from only the

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,540
architectures to flexible microservices
that can dramatically reduce your.

10
00:00:29,065 --> 00:00:30,265
Operational costs.

11
00:00:30,475 --> 00:00:34,855
While accelerating development cycles,
we'll examine practical implementation

12
00:00:34,855 --> 00:00:39,995
steps, real world success, and
critical concentrations for security

13
00:00:39,995 --> 00:00:41,645
business intelligence integration.

14
00:00:41,705 --> 00:00:45,725
By the end of this presentation,
you will have a clear roadmap for

15
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:47,705
your own serverless transformation.

16
00:00:48,205 --> 00:00:52,975
Now, let's say why migrate
to serverless architectures?

17
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:56,945
Serverless architectures deliver
compelling benefits that extend far beyond

18
00:00:56,945 --> 00:00:59,120
the simple cost savings organization May.

19
00:00:59,615 --> 00:01:03,545
Organizations migrating from
monolithic systems report dramatically

20
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:05,375
reduced operational overhead.

21
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:10,445
So with typical cost reductions
ranging from 30 to 60%, in some cases,

22
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:14,655
organizations leveraging event driven
serverless patterns per specific

23
00:01:14,655 --> 00:01:20,835
workloads have seen cost reductions
exceeding 70% due to the precise resource

24
00:01:20,835 --> 00:01:22,935
allocation and paper execution models.

25
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,180
So perhaps more importantly, these
organizations experience a 40% boost in

26
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:33,130
the developer productivity by eliminating
infrastructure management tasks.

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,180
This translates to fast innovation
cycles and significantly reduce

28
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,030
time to market for new features.

29
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,980
So studies indicate that serverless
adoption can accelerate feature deployment

30
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,650
by up to 50%, enabling business to
respond rapidly to market changes.

31
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,050
Furthermore, the inherent scalability
of serverless architecture leads to a

32
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,370
20 to 30% improvement in application
resilience, including downtime

33
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,140
and enhancing the USR experience.

34
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,520
So beyond the cost and productivity,
serverless architectures

35
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,800
contribute to improved scalability.

36
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,480
So which means like applications
automatically scale based on demand

37
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,250
handling certain spikes in traffic
with minimal manual intervention, or in

38
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,780
cases, no manual intervention at all.

39
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,620
This can lead to a five times more
increase in peak traffic handling capacity

40
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,120
compared to traditional architectures.

41
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,710
So reduced time to market developers
focus on code not infrastructure

42
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,870
leading to a faster development cycles.

43
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,275
Companies have reported to 25% decrease
in time, in the time required to

44
00:02:36,275 --> 00:02:40,235
launch these new products or features
enhanced operational efficiency.

45
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:45,265
With managed services handling tasks
like patching and scaling operation

46
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,365
teams can focus on strategic initiatives.

47
00:02:47,695 --> 00:02:51,715
This can result in a 15 to 20%
reduction in operational burden,

48
00:02:52,195 --> 00:02:54,625
increased agility and flexibility.

49
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:59,335
Serverless enables rapid prototyping
and experimentation facilitating

50
00:02:59,335 --> 00:03:01,135
agile development practices.

51
00:03:01,465 --> 00:03:05,235
Organizations find that
they're able to test and deploy

52
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:07,245
these new ideas 30% faster.

53
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,090
Environment sustainability, paper
use models, reduced waste wasted

54
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,050
resources contributing to a more
sustainable computing practices.

55
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,290
So this one steady estimated a
potential 10 to 20% decrease in the

56
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:25,310
energy consumption, but a certain
workloads when migrated to serverless.

57
00:03:25,945 --> 00:03:28,405
Global reach the server.

58
00:03:28,455 --> 00:03:32,035
The serverless platform often provide
a built in global distribution,

59
00:03:32,035 --> 00:03:36,565
simplifying the deployment of
applications to multiple regions.

60
00:03:36,805 --> 00:03:42,135
Some services report latency reductions
of 40% when moving to a global second.

61
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,255
A global edge based service.

62
00:03:44,365 --> 00:03:47,755
S serverless location, simplified
microservices implementation.

63
00:03:47,785 --> 00:03:50,965
Serverless functions are ideal
for building microservices,

64
00:03:51,595 --> 00:03:55,695
allowing for a granular scaling
and independent deployments.

65
00:03:56,115 --> 00:04:01,345
Organizations see up to 35%
decrease in complexity of managing

66
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:04,615
microservice deployments, even
driven architecture adoption.

67
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:09,665
So serverless aligns naturally
with event driven architectures

68
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:11,735
enabling real time data processing.

69
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:13,725
And asynchronous workflows.

70
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:17,985
This has been shown to improve
real time processing speeds by

71
00:04:17,985 --> 00:04:20,115
20 to 50% in certain use cases.

72
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:25,235
These benefits collectively contribute to
more agile, cost effective and scalable

73
00:04:25,235 --> 00:04:30,065
development environment, empowering
organizations to innovate and compete

74
00:04:30,095 --> 00:04:32,945
effectively in the digital landscape.

75
00:04:33,445 --> 00:04:40,135
So when we un, let's try to understand
a bit more about the monolith.

76
00:04:40,585 --> 00:04:42,385
Challenge monolith.

77
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:45,775
SaaS applications create
significant obstacles that

78
00:04:45,775 --> 00:04:49,855
severely constrain the business
agility and market responsiveness.

79
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:52,945
They're tightly coupled
components Establish a critical

80
00:04:52,945 --> 00:04:53,910
development bottleneck.

81
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,230
Where even minor modifications require
comprehensive testing across the

82
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,930
entire application, dramatically.

83
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,830
Ex extending release cycles
from days to weeks or months.

84
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,130
Specifically, a study found that companies
utilizing monolithic architecture

85
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,990
experienced and average release cycle
of 12 weeks for new features compared to

86
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,450
three weeks for those using microservices.

87
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,570
This translates to a 75.

88
00:05:22,185 --> 00:05:24,075
Person reduction in deployment speed.

89
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:27,855
Furthermore regression testing
for a single feature change in a

90
00:05:27,855 --> 00:05:32,385
monolithic application can consume
up to 40% of development time.

91
00:05:32,435 --> 00:05:34,865
Diverting resources from innovation.

92
00:05:35,365 --> 00:05:39,745
The fundamental inability to
scale independent components

93
00:05:39,865 --> 00:05:44,245
leads to substantial resource
inefficiency, forcing organization

94
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:46,190
to over-provision infrastructure.

95
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,410
To accommodate peak demand scenarios.

96
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,270
For example, a typical e-commerce
platform using a monolithic architecture

97
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:59,180
might allocate a server capacity
for a black Friday level traffic

98
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,820
year around resulting in an average
of th 60 to 70% of ideal resource

99
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,250
utilization during normal operations.

100
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,710
This over provisioning leads to 32.

101
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:14,760
50% increase in infrastructure
cost compared to architectures that

102
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,560
will allow for granular scaling.

103
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,910
Moreover, the lack of independent
scaling often results in degraded

104
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,650
performance during peak loads with
reported latency increases up to five

105
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,900
seconds leading up to a 20% drop in.

106
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,110
User engagement.

107
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,310
So additional challenges include
technology lock-in monolithic

108
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,820
architectures often rely on a
single technology stack, making it

109
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,450
difficult to adopt new technologies or
integrated more than cloud services.

110
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:45,540
This limits innovation and can lead up
to 25% increase in maintenance overhead

111
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:50,910
as legacy systems become harder to
support increased risk of failure.

112
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,880
A failure in one component can
bring down the entire application

113
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,350
leading to a significant downtime.

114
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,310
So studies have shown that monolithic
applications experience a 40% more

115
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:05,390
downtime incidents compared to
microservices based architectures

116
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,910
difficulty in onboarding new developers.

117
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,330
The complexity of a large code banks
makes a challenge for new developers

118
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,475
to understand and contribute, resulting
in a 30% increase in onboarding time.

119
00:07:15,975 --> 00:07:19,785
Limited ability to implement
continuous delivery.

120
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:24,345
So the long release cycles associated
with monolithic applications

121
00:07:24,615 --> 00:07:27,885
hinder the adoption of continuous
delivery, PR delivery practices,

122
00:07:27,885 --> 00:07:31,365
slowing down the feedback loop
and delaying the time to market.

123
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:38,015
Organizations report a 50% decrease in the
ability to deliver small frequent updates.

124
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:41,045
Reduced innovation velocity.

125
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:45,875
The complexity of changing the
code and the risk of associated

126
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:49,325
with changes slows down the rate at
which the new features can be added.

127
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:54,845
One study indicated a decrease
of roughly 20% in the number of

128
00:07:54,845 --> 00:07:56,255
new features released per year.

129
00:07:56,825 --> 00:07:58,175
Database contention.

130
00:07:58,655 --> 00:08:03,905
Monolithic applications often rely on
a single database, which can become

131
00:08:03,905 --> 00:08:08,265
bottleneck as the application scales
leading to the performance degradation.

132
00:08:08,745 --> 00:08:12,665
So this can limit the applications
ability to handle high transition,

133
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,225
high transaction volumes.

134
00:08:14,255 --> 00:08:18,185
Database contention can, has
been shown to cause 15 to 25%

135
00:08:18,185 --> 00:08:20,465
reduction in transaction throughput.

136
00:08:21,035 --> 00:08:25,385
These limitations underscore the
need for more flexible and scalable

137
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:29,225
architecture, such as microservices
or serverless to meet our demands

138
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:30,785
for the modern SaaS applications.

139
00:08:31,285 --> 00:08:37,415
Now let's take a look at decomposing
the monoliths into microservices.

140
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:41,435
So these transformation of
microservices require a thoughtful

141
00:08:41,435 --> 00:08:45,215
decomposition based on business
domains rather than technical layers.

142
00:08:45,715 --> 00:08:50,285
The study suggests that organizations that
focus on business domain decompositions

143
00:08:50,285 --> 00:08:55,625
here, 30 to 40% reduction in integration
complexities, post migration,

144
00:08:56,195 --> 00:08:58,115
identify the service boundaries.

145
00:08:58,115 --> 00:08:59,555
I. Let's add map.

146
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:03,335
So we need to map the functional
domains and business capabilities to

147
00:09:03,395 --> 00:09:07,805
establish clear service boundaries
using domain driven design principles

148
00:09:07,805 --> 00:09:11,555
and event storming techniques,
effective boundary identification

149
00:09:11,555 --> 00:09:15,245
through event storming and context
mapping reveals and natural service.

150
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,860
Demarcations that aligns with
organizational structures

151
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,270
and business capabilities.

152
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,660
Specifically utilizing event
storming workshops can reduce

153
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,050
service boundary definition by the
time of by 20 to 25% and improve

154
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,550
alignment with business stakeholders.

155
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,270
Research indicates that well
defined service boundaries result

156
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,130
in 15 to 20% improvement in the.

157
00:09:37,865 --> 00:09:38,705
Team autonomy.

158
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:41,615
So define the service interfaces.

159
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:46,765
Create robust well controlled
version APIs with well-documented

160
00:09:46,765 --> 00:09:50,095
contracts that enforce loose
couplings and enable independent

161
00:09:50,095 --> 00:09:52,735
service evolution organizations.

162
00:09:52,785 --> 00:09:58,210
Implementing API first strategies report
a 35 to 40% increase in the developments.

163
00:09:58,235 --> 00:10:03,545
P due to reduced dependency, adopting
open API specifications can reduce the

164
00:10:03,545 --> 00:10:06,945
API documentation efforts by up to 50%.

165
00:10:07,005 --> 00:10:08,805
And improve developer onboarding.

166
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:12,265
Further mode version control
of APIs has shown to decrease

167
00:10:12,265 --> 00:10:14,985
breaking changes up to by 25%.

168
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,410
So refactor incrementally extract
services systematically through the

169
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:24,240
strangler pattern, prioritizing high
value low risk components while maintain

170
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,340
the maintaining the system stability.

171
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,960
Successful migrations leverage the
STR strangler pattern methodology

172
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,700
systematically replacing the monolith
functionality while preserving the system,

173
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,910
integrating implement a service mesh.

174
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:39,660
Deploy.

175
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,960
Sophisticated service discovery and
communication layer that enables

176
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,320
resilient interservice communication,
circuit breaking and observability.

177
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:54,340
A single mesh can improve latency back
to 10 to 20% and reduce service value

178
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:59,290
rates by 90, 50, 30% through features
like circuit breaking and retry policies.

179
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:03,355
Implementing comprehensive
observability with the service me

180
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:08,125
leads to a 40 to 50 person reduction
in the mean time to resolution.

181
00:11:08,155 --> 00:11:12,325
It's called S-M-T-T-R for
service related incidents.

182
00:11:12,895 --> 00:11:16,735
Additional points to consider
while decomposing the monoliths

183
00:11:16,735 --> 00:11:20,845
into microservices could be
organizational alignment.

184
00:11:21,145 --> 00:11:24,835
Should the microservice architecture
designs aligns with the organization

185
00:11:24,895 --> 00:11:28,885
structure and culture that's fit
as more important automation.

186
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,860
Automate deployment, testing
and monitoring of update to

187
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,010
enable the continuous delivery
and reduce the manual error.

188
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:40,870
So implementing the CICD pipelines
can decrease the deployment times

189
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,710
up to by 60 to 70% security.

190
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,425
Implement robust security
measures including authentication,

191
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:53,465
authorization, and encryption to
protect the interservice communication.

192
00:11:53,995 --> 00:11:55,555
Monitoring and observability.

193
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:58,525
Implement comprehensive monitoring
and logging to gain insights

194
00:11:58,525 --> 00:12:02,245
into the service performance by
identifying potential issues.

195
00:12:02,665 --> 00:12:03,805
Database management.

196
00:12:03,865 --> 00:12:07,105
Address database management challenges
by considering patterns such as

197
00:12:07,105 --> 00:12:08,965
database per service or shared.

198
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,690
Database with careful schema design.

199
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:16,160
So by focusing on these principles
and incorporating data driven designs

200
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,830
and organizations can effectively
navigate the complexity complexities

201
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:24,470
of microservices, navi migration,
and unlock the benefits of increased

202
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,380
agility, scalability, and resilience.

203
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:32,610
Now let's take a look at a
couple of the AWS services.

204
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,850
The first one would be the AWS
Lambda, the Serverless Foundation.

205
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:41,250
AWS Lambda serves as the computational
cornerstone of the modern serverless

206
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,970
architectures executing code in
response to events with zero server

207
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,490
provisioning or management overhead.

208
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:52,740
This paradigm shift fundamentally
transforms the economics of cloud

209
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:59,250
computing by implementing a consumption
based pricing model that changes precisely

210
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,380
for the compute resources consumed.

211
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,860
Studies indicate that the organizations
are shifting to Lambda based

212
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,580
architecture experience, a 60 to
80% reduction in the operational

213
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,350
overhead related to server management.

214
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:15,810
Event, even executions functions
instantly activate in response to

215
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,770
triggers from AWS services completely
eliminating idle resource consumption

216
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,460
and delivering true paper use
computing with millisecond precision.

217
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,510
In typical event driven scenarios,
lambda functions demonstr a cold stock,

218
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:31,740
cold start latency of under a hundred
milliseconds and 90% of invocations.

219
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:36,270
And subsequent worm invocations achieve
latencies below 10 milliseconds.

220
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:41,710
This precise, this precision in resource
allocation leads to a 20 to 30% reduction

221
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:46,420
in overall compute cost compared to
traditional VM based event processing.

222

single request to thousands per second.

225
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,170
Lambda can scale to handle certain
spikes in traffic, achieving a

226
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:10,530
99.99% availability rate, and can
scale from zero to thousands of

227
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,330
concurrent executions in seconds.

228
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,500
Auto-scaling capabilities have been shown
to reduce the peak load latency by 40 to

229
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,770
50% compared to manually scaled systems.

to decrease the development time

235
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:41,825
by 15 to 25% as teams can utilize
preferred languages and libraries.

236
00:14:41,825 --> 00:14:46,755
Furthermore, teams reported 10 to 15%
increase in code maintainability by

237
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:49,005
utilizing the right tool for the job.

238
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:53,505
With Lambda millisecond billing
granularity and zero friction scaling

239
00:14:53,505 --> 00:14:59,025
capabilities, organizations can
achieve unprecedented optimization.

240
00:14:59,345 --> 00:15:03,515
Compared to traditional always on
server instances, enterprises typically

241
00:15:03,515 --> 00:15:09,095
realizes 70 to 90% reduction in
compute costs for appropriate workloads

242
00:15:09,095 --> 00:15:13,865
after migration, while simultaneously
improving responsiveness and

243
00:15:13,865 --> 00:15:15,875
eliminating capacity planning concerns.

244
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,975
Additional data points and benefits
include reduced time to market,

245
00:15:20,215 --> 00:15:25,405

reducing integration edit by 15 to 20%.

364
00:23:25,365 --> 00:23:26,655
Stage deployments.

365
00:23:26,715 --> 00:23:30,725
Leverage AWS code pipeline with
canary deployment strategies to

366
00:23:30,725 --> 00:23:35,695
methodo methodically introduce changes
while continuously monitoring for

367
00:23:35,695 --> 00:23:37,555
anomalies and performance impacts.

368
00:23:38,035 --> 00:23:44,065
Canary deployments reduce the risk of
widespread failures by 90 to 95% and

369
00:23:44,065 --> 00:23:46,585
enable rapid rollbacks in case of issues.

370
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:50,655
Automated anomaly detection with

Stage deployments combined with
feature flags, reduce the impact

373
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:00,030
of fail deployments by up to 50%.

374
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:05,390
Industry leading organizations implement
sophisticated stage deployment strategies

375
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:09,830
with intelligent rollback capabilities,
preserving the system integrity while

376
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,190
dramatically accelerating release cadence.

377
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,485
This transformative approach has enabled
the forward thinking companies to achieve

378
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,970
deployment frequencies measured in hours.

379
00:24:20,735 --> 00:24:25,445
Sometimes minutes compared to the weeks
or months required with traditional

380
00:24:25,445 --> 00:24:30,085
infrastructure models, specifically
organizations using automated server

381
00:24:30,085 --> 00:24:35,155
as CICD pipelines report a 70 to
80% reduction in deployment times.

382
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,460
Let's take a look at securing
the serverless applications.

383
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:43,210
Securing serverless applications
require a shift in approach from

384
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:47,460
traditional infrastructure protection
to function level controls.

385
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,440
Each lambda function should operate
with minimal permissions, allowing

386
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,305
the principle of leased privilege.

387
00:24:53,805 --> 00:24:57,735
With carefully defined IAM rules,
studies indicate that the organization

388
00:24:57,735 --> 00:25:01,335
implementing a frying grained IAM
roll reduce the risk of lateral

389
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:02,835
movement after the security breach.

390
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,895
B two 40 to 50%.

391
00:25:05,435 --> 00:25:10,815
Function level IAM rules implement
fine grain permission boundaries by

392
00:25:11,265 --> 00:25:14,895
using the principle of leash privilege
for each lambda function, restricting

393
00:25:14,895 --> 00:25:17,925
access to only required resources.

394
00:25:18,355 --> 00:25:23,665
Implementing function level IM roles
reduces the attack surface by 20 to 30%

395
00:25:23,665 --> 00:25:26,195
compared to broad service wide roles.

396
00:25:26,615 --> 00:25:31,145
Utilizing the IM policies with resource
level permissions reduces the impact

397
00:25:31,145 --> 00:25:34,965
of compromise Credentials by up to 35%.

398
00:25:35,465 --> 00:25:39,765
Secrets management restored the
sensitive configuration in AWS Secrets

399
00:25:39,765 --> 00:25:41,475
Manager with automatic rotation.

400
00:25:42,075 --> 00:25:46,185
And secure retrieval by author
authorized functions only.

401
00:25:46,185 --> 00:25:49,635
Secrets Manager reduces the risk
of hard coded credentials by

402
00:25:49,635 --> 00:25:54,195
60 to 70% and automates secret
rotation, reducing the window of

403
00:25:54,195 --> 00:25:55,695
vulnerability, implement the least.

404
00:25:55,765 --> 00:25:59,725
Privilege access to Secrets Manager
ensures that only authorized function

405
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:05,295
can retrieve more sensitive data, input,
validation, implement strict schema

406
00:26:05,295 --> 00:26:07,925
validation of API at API level boundaries.

407
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:12,170
Using the API gateway request
validators to prevent injection attacks.

408
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:17,830
API gateway validation reduces the
risk of a SQL injection and cross site.

409
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,680
The scripting attacks by 30 to 40%.

410
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:25,850
Implement input validation at the
API layer reduces the load on Lambda

411
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:30,770
functions, improving performance and
security dependency scanning, integrate

412
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:35,150
automated vulnerability scanning into CICD
pipelines to detect known vulnerabilities

413
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,500
in third party dependencies.

414
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,100
Dependency scanning reduces
the risk of exploiting known

415
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,230
vulnerabilities by 25 to 35%.

416
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:46,820
Implementing software composition
analysis, SEA tools in CICD

417
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,210
pipelines reduces the time to
identify remediate vulnerabilities.

418
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:55,010
Data protection remains critical
with encrypted requirements for

419
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,470
both data in transit and at rest.

420
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:03,470
AWS provides tools like KMS for,
encrypting key management partners and

421
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:07,550
partner store for securing configuration,
enabling a comprehensive security

422
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,590
posture for serverless applications.

423
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:14,650
So the additional data points and security
practices to consider would be networks

424
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:21,690
segmentation, runtime, security and
logging and monitoring security audits,

425
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:26,670
immutable deployments, ensuring that the
Lambda function deployments are immutable.

426
00:27:27,015 --> 00:27:31,635
Preventing unauthorized modifications,
web application, firewall rules

427
00:27:32,135 --> 00:27:35,675
encryption address, and in
transit, regular security updates.

428
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:39,815
This is keep all the dependencies
and runtime environments up to date

429
00:27:39,815 --> 00:27:41,285
with the latest security patches.

430
00:27:41,835 --> 00:27:44,625
Automated patches reduces these
vulnerability windows as well.

431
00:27:45,355 --> 00:27:50,915
By implementing the security practices,
organizations can build secure and

432
00:27:50,915 --> 00:27:53,945
resilient serverless applications
that protect sensitive data.

433
00:27:54,365 --> 00:27:57,365
