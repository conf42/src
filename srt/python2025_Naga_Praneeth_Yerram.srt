00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,870
Hello everyone, and thank you for
joining conference 42 Python 2025.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,219
Today, we'll explore how
artificial intelligence is

3
00:00:09,229 --> 00:00:10,910
reshaping unified communications.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,310
Creating smarter, more
automated systems that enhance

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,840
productivity and collaboration.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,910
We'll discuss specific innovations,
their impact across industries,

7
00:00:21,299 --> 00:00:22,860
and what the future holds.

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:23,730
Let's begin.

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:30,060
All right, AI power call routing,
which optimizing efficiency So the AI

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,630
powered call routing uses predictive
analysis to understand historical

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,869
data like call patterns, agent
performance, and customer interactions.

12
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,790
This ensures calls are matched with
the right expert, cutting down the call

13
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,139
transfers and improving resolution rates.

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,040
By balancing workloads and matching
skills in real time, support teams

15
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,020
handle thousands of additional
calls daily, improving efficiency.

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,589
These improvements lead to happier
customers with satisfaction scores

17
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,899
jumping significantly higher due to
quicker and more accurate resolutions.

18
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,180
Moving next, moving to the
next slide, voice recognition

19
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,760
and real time transcription.

20
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,660
So this would define enhancing
documentation and efficiency.

21
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:19,685
So the key points are AI speech
recognition now achieves up to 95

22
00:01:19,715 --> 00:01:24,004
percent accuracy, even in noisy
environments or with multiple speakers,

23
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:25,825
making it a highly reliable one.

24
00:01:26,495 --> 00:01:30,875
This technology creates real time
transcriptions, strengthening compliance

25
00:01:30,994 --> 00:01:35,695
and improving collaboration by generating
searchable and shareable record.

26
00:01:36,545 --> 00:01:41,125
By automating manual transcription
task, business reduce administrative

27
00:01:41,215 --> 00:01:43,595
overhead and allow employees to focus on.

28
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,960
Strategic work.

29
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,210
Moving on to the next slide.

30
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:52,390
This slide defines AI driven virtual
assistants, which is automating

31
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,130
tasks and boosting productivity.

32
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,880
Virtual assistants powered by AI handle
routine tasks such as scheduling meetings.

33
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,220
managing emails and organizing calendars.

34
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:07,630
This automation has boosted
productivity by 30 to 40 as employees

35
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,680
can now dedicate more time to
creative and strategic activities.

36
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,040
These assistants also improve user
experience by providing 24 by 7

37
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,890
personalized support, adapting
to individual preferences and

38
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,550
responding to remarkable accuracy.

39
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,200
Moving to the next slide.

40
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,730
AI in Unified Communications.

41
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,530
It's a new era of communication.

42
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,779
AI brings voice together, voice,
video, and messaging platforms.

43
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,200
Reducing silos, and enabling
seamless collaboration

44
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,880
across teams and departments.

45
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,860
Automated power by AI analysis
communication patterns.

46
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:47,745
Cutting response time and
increasing productivity as

47
00:02:47,765 --> 00:02:49,345
communication needs growth.

48
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:54,015
Cloud based AI systems provide
scalability to maintain demand while

49
00:02:54,065 --> 00:02:56,195
continuously learning and improving.

50
00:02:56,695 --> 00:02:57,515
Moving next,

51
00:02:58,015 --> 00:03:00,955
AI and unified communications
and their key benefits.

52
00:03:01,274 --> 00:03:02,474
Why AI matters.

53
00:03:02,764 --> 00:03:07,065
So let's look into the core benefits
of AI in unified communications.

54
00:03:07,575 --> 00:03:11,404
Number one, faster workflows
through automation with a 40

55
00:03:11,405 --> 00:03:13,225
percent improvement in efficiency.

56
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:19,630
Second enhancement customer enhanced
customer experiences with personalized

57
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:25,119
real time interactions third significant
cost reductions Cutting operational

58
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,830
expenses by almost 30 percent
fourth improved team collaboration

59
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,825
according across departments
driving innovation and agility.

60
00:03:34,595 --> 00:03:39,065
Number five, a competitive edge
for early adopters of these

61
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:40,725
transformative technologies.

62
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:47,215
Moving on to the next slide, use
cases of AI across the industries.

63
00:03:47,814 --> 00:03:50,094
We are talking about the
real world impact here.

64
00:03:50,555 --> 00:03:55,545
So let's suppose in healthcare, AI driven
transcription and translation services

65
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:58,625
reduce documentation time by 50%.

66
00:03:59,045 --> 00:04:03,815
to ensure over 99 percent accuracy,
enhancing patient outcomes.

67
00:04:04,145 --> 00:04:09,815
In finance, advanced AI chatbots handle up
to 90 percent of inquiries automatically,

68
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:15,415
while machine learning provides or
it prevents fraud by identifying

69
00:04:15,415 --> 00:04:17,335
suspicious patterns in real time.

70
00:04:17,835 --> 00:04:21,035
Retail benefits from
personalized AI recommendations.

71
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,160
And faster query resolution
leading to higher satisfaction

72
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,560
rates and reduced support.

73
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,600
Moving on to the next slide
Implementation strategies.

74
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,430
How do I get started in here?

75
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:38,550
so Implementing AI starts with a thorough
evaluation of current communication system

76
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:41,790
to identify AI areas of improvement.

77
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,799
Next focus on defining key use cases
where AI can provide the greatest impact

78
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,760
Such as tasks that can achieve over 30
efficiency gains and or cost reductions

79
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:01,310
Pilot projects are essential a 90 day
proof of concept with Clear kpis can

80
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:08,020
demonstrate tangible roi Finally the scale
of implementation across the organization

81
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:13,990
through a phased phase rollout Supporting
by training and changed management

82
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:19,850
strategies moving on to the next one AI
in Unified Communications Future Trends.

83
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,110
AI is evolving rapidly.

84
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:27,049
Advanced natural processing will
soon understand context, tone, and

85
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:32,530
intent with human accuracy in real
time across hundreds of languages.

86
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,794
Predictive analysis will become even
smarter, forecasting communication needs.

87
00:05:38,155 --> 00:05:41,665
scheduling meetings automatically
and optimizing workflows.

88
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:47,835
Personalized communication will grow with
AI adjusted styles and content delivery

89
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:50,014
dynamically to boost the engagement.

90
00:05:50,514 --> 00:05:53,564
Enhanced security measures will
ensure compliance and prevent

91
00:05:53,594 --> 00:05:57,754
threats, safeguarding communications,
and across the platform.

92
00:05:58,254 --> 00:06:02,094
Moving next, AI and Unified
Communications, the closing

93
00:06:02,094 --> 00:06:04,434
slide, a catalyst for innovation.

94
00:06:04,524 --> 00:06:06,874
So it is, AI is a collaborative journey.

95
00:06:07,304 --> 00:06:11,214
AI and Unified Communications
represents a fundamental shift

96
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,934
on how we work and interact.

97
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:17,014
By embracing these innovations,
organizations are not only improving

98
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:20,809
efficiency and satisfaction,
But also redefining how teams

99
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:22,819
collaborate and businesses succeed.

100
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:27,009
The future is exciting and this
is just the beginning of what

101
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,969
