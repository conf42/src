1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,579
Hey, good evening everyone.

2
00:00:02,079 --> 00:00:06,550
It is an absolute honor to stand
before you at Com 42 Mission

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,109
Learning 2025 conference.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,820
My name is thi I'm leading
engineer from Credit Union.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:19,289
Today we embark into the fraud of
financial security, a place where.

6
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:23,389
Artificial intelligence and mission
learning and risk management matches

7
00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:25,669
to redefine our digital economy.

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,749
Imagine in our modern financial
ecosystem as a vast network of

9
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,399
countless transactions harming every
second in this vibrant landscape.

10
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,379
Trust is the foundation of every
interaction, and even the smallest

11
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:44,199
irregularity can spark a major
risk before risk management.

12
00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:48,179
Coming through records, spotting
errors and reacting only

13
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:49,649
after incident had occurred.

14
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:56,809
That method, although one sufficient now
falls short against the sophisticated

15
00:00:56,809 --> 00:00:58,239
methods of modern frauders.

16
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:05,054
Today, AI acts as a tireless guardian that
learns continuously from realtime data by

17
00:01:05,054 --> 00:01:10,844
predicting unusual behavior long before
it evolves into a full blown threat.

18
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:15,569
With advanced neural networking and
machine learning, AI not only detects

19
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:21,229
anomalous patterns, but also stops them in
the tracks picture and intelligent systems

20
00:01:21,889 --> 00:01:26,089
that monitors thousands of transactions
simultaneously with each transaction.

21
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:26,689
It.

22
00:01:27,304 --> 00:01:31,774
Compared current behavior with
historical pattern learning what normally

23
00:01:31,774 --> 00:01:35,404
happens and flagging any D deviations.

24
00:01:35,914 --> 00:01:41,434
This proactive approach means that
potential threats or neutralize

25
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,054
it before any harm is done.

26
00:01:43,774 --> 00:01:49,489
It's like having a vigilant security
team that never sleeps, always adapting

27
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:51,169
to new challenges and ensuring the.

28
00:01:51,669 --> 00:01:56,949
Today will reveal how AI reshapes
risk management from increasing

29
00:01:56,949 --> 00:02:02,739
detections accuracy to reduce false
alarms and up responses to threat.

30
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:07,749
I'll share real time examples
by illustrating how financial

31
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:13,584
institutes are saving millions
simply by being mu up ahead of.

32
00:02:14,084 --> 00:02:20,054
As we dive in, think of AI not as
a cold mission, but as a dedicated

33
00:02:20,984 --> 00:02:25,874
partner that supports you every
time you make a digital transaction.

34
00:02:26,374 --> 00:02:28,194
Coming to next slide, oh.

35
00:02:28,694 --> 00:02:30,104
AI power fraud detection.

36
00:02:30,494 --> 00:02:35,024
Fraud detection in today's financial
world is no longer a reactive process.

37
00:02:35,684 --> 00:02:39,659
It is a dynamic AI power strategy
that works around the clock.

38
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:45,304
Traditional systems rely on pixel tools
on historical data, but the static

39
00:02:45,304 --> 00:02:50,284
models often fall short when facing
rapidly evolving fraudulent techniques.

40
00:02:50,644 --> 00:02:54,004
Today, air fraud detection
elevates our defense.

41
00:02:54,724 --> 00:03:00,544
By continuously learning from vast amount
of data, uncovering hidden patterns, once

42
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:07,284
responding to threats with unprecedented
speed and accuracy, imagine a system

43
00:03:07,284 --> 00:03:11,004
that increased detection accuracy by 87%.

44
00:03:11,514 --> 00:03:18,044
This means that rather than relying on
simplistic rules that might miss signs of.

45
00:03:18,544 --> 00:03:21,574
Understands the complex
behaviors behind transactions.

46
00:03:22,354 --> 00:03:25,774
By analyzing hundreds of
variables in real time.

47
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:30,474
AI identifies even the slightest
deviation from normal patterns.

48
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,674
For example, if your customer
who normally make small purchases

49
00:03:35,154 --> 00:03:39,384
should initiate multiple high
value transaction, the AI system

50
00:03:39,804 --> 00:03:42,134
instantly for further investigations.

51
00:03:42,634 --> 00:03:44,284
Is only part of the story.

52
00:03:45,274 --> 00:03:49,744
One of the biggest challenge in fraud
detection is the issue of false positive.

53
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:55,534
When a system triggers too many
alert, legitimate transactions

54
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:57,004
can be unnecessarily.

55
00:03:57,504 --> 00:04:00,264
Customers and clogging
up financial channels.

56
00:04:00,954 --> 00:04:06,174
AI addresses this by reducing
false positive by 63% by ensuring

57
00:04:06,174 --> 00:04:09,624
that only through suspicious
activities are escalated.

58
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:15,154
These kind of this refined approach saves
valuable time and resources enabling

59
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:22,054
institutions to focus on real threats
without causing in to genuine customers.

60
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:28,645
Another remarkable benefit is accelerated
response time, which is up to 95%

61
00:04:28,674 --> 00:04:30,534
faster than traditional systems.

62
00:04:31,015 --> 00:04:37,734
In today's digital age, every millisecond
counts when an anomaly is detected.

63
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:42,474
The AI Systems act immediately by haling
a transaction before it completes.

64
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,084
If it deems two.

65
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:52,794
This near instantaneous reactions is
vital for preventing fraud as delays

66
00:04:53,364 --> 00:04:55,664
can allow activities to succeed.

67
00:04:56,164 --> 00:04:59,779
Coming to next slide pattern,
recognization breakthrough.

68
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:03,999
In this fight against fraud,
pattern recognition is the

69
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:06,969
secret weapon that sets a part.

70
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:13,569
Fraud detection often hinges on
the ability to see the unseen.

71
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:16,799
A web of SubT patterns
that humans might miss.

72
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:21,659
AI is breakthrough in pattern recognition.

73
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:23,269
Enormous dataset.

74
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:30,229
Identify normal behavioral trends and
pinpoint anomalies that signs fraud

75
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,139
before any visible damage occurs.

76
00:05:33,859 --> 00:05:35,929
Let's begin with process
of data collection.

77
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:42,699
In today's faults, financial data use
sourced from different channels like bank

78
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:47,114
transactions, payment gateways, mobile
apps, and even social media interactions.

79
00:05:48,084 --> 00:05:54,024
These AI systems aggregate this diverse
data stream to build a comprehensive

80
00:05:54,024 --> 00:05:55,464
picture of financial behavior.

81
00:05:56,364 --> 00:06:01,214
Every transaction service has a puzzle
piece contributing to an overall

82
00:06:01,214 --> 00:06:03,524
pattern that defines what is normal.

83
00:06:04,124 --> 00:06:07,694
Once this massive collection
of data is like harmonized.

84
00:06:08,194 --> 00:06:11,614
It is analyzed using advanced
neural networking techniques.

85
00:06:12,244 --> 00:06:16,384
These networks learn from historical
transactions, establishing

86
00:06:16,924 --> 00:06:20,674
baseline patterns for individuals
and collective behavior.

87
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:25,344
Furthermore, AI leverages
anomaly detection algorithms

88
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:27,469
that flags activities even when.

89
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:32,799
When viewed in isolation, considered
multiple low value transactions

90
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:34,149
spread across different accounts.

91
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,769
Each transaction individually might
not seem suspicious, but together

92
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,869
they form a pattern that suggest
coordinated fraudulent activities.

93
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:48,599
Transaction systems might overlook
such kind of behavior, but AI

94
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:53,564
pattern recognizes brings this
hidden connections to light.

95
00:06:54,064 --> 00:06:59,954
Coming to next slide, real time financial
transactions, monitoring and interactions.

96
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:05,634
Imagine a system that never sleeps, addit
Sentinel, that monitors every financial

97
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:12,804
transaction as it happens, scrutinizing
hundreds of risk factors in microseconds.

98
00:07:13,304 --> 00:07:15,584
That is the promise of real transaction.

99
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:23,289
Access both the vigilant and
watchman under pro and scepter in

100
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:25,150
today's high speed distal economy.

101
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:30,579
Timing is everything ideally
of even f fraction of a second

102
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:32,919
can turn a minor anomaly.

103
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,799
Full-blown security breach.

104
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:39,390
Realtime financial transactions
monitors begins the moment

105
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,949
a transaction is initiated.

106
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:46,710
Data flow instantly through intelligent
algorithms that compare each new

107
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:51,720
transaction against millions of historical
records, checking for any deactive,

108
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,289
any deviations from expected behavior.

109
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:58,694
These systems evaluate details
like transaction amount.

110
00:07:59,225 --> 00:08:04,955
The time, the geographical location,
and even the user's typical behavior.

111
00:08:05,675 --> 00:08:11,315
When any unusual activity is detected,
perhaps a SHA done change in spinning

112
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:16,265
pattern or a new device used for access,
the system is immediately locked.

113
00:08:16,765 --> 00:08:20,425
This instantaneous detection
allows the AI not only to flag the

114
00:08:21,055 --> 00:08:23,125
as suspicious, but also to take.

115
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:30,705
For instance, when the system recognizes
a potential threat, it can auto inter

116
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:35,865
by using the transaction or routing
it for additional verifications.

117
00:08:36,555 --> 00:08:42,125
The response is nearly instantaneous,
up to 95% faster than traditional

118
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:46,505
methods reducing the window
in which fraud can occur.

119
00:08:47,005 --> 00:08:48,385
Coming to next slide.

120
00:08:48,885 --> 00:08:52,515
This is the slide where we discuss
about transforming loan collections.

121
00:08:53,295 --> 00:08:59,565
Loan collection has traditional
libin, challenging lab in process,

122
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:04,085
manual follow ups and standardized
reminders of and field sort of

123
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,175
addressing the unique circumstances of.

124
00:09:07,675 --> 00:09:12,145
Revolutionizing loan collections
by transforming it for a rigid

125
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:18,565
one size fits all approach into a
personalized data-driven strategy

126
00:09:19,045 --> 00:09:23,215
that improves recovery rates and
strengthens customer relationships.

127
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:28,285
At the heart of this transformation
is the ability of AI to analyze

128
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:31,755
and historical data points by evaluating.

129
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:36,185
Borrowing history, payment
behavior, seasonal spending,

130
00:09:36,185 --> 00:09:38,615
and even extra economic factors.

131
00:09:39,115 --> 00:09:46,375
AI can predict each borrower's likelihood
of repayment with remarkable procession.

132
00:09:47,215 --> 00:09:52,495
Imagine in receiving personalized
outreach that does more than just

133
00:09:52,495 --> 00:09:54,715
remind you about your next payment.

134
00:09:55,405 --> 00:09:58,780
It speaks to your individual
financial situations offering.

135
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,585
Flexible solutions that suits your needs.

136
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:06,735
For financial institutions,
the benefits are very immense.

137
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:13,005
AI driven strategies have boosted recovery
rates significantly in many cases.

138
00:10:13,005 --> 00:10:15,691
Personal roles, personal loans,
received recovery has seen

139
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:20,046
improvements up to 27% points.

140
00:10:20,546 --> 00:10:26,246
In the business loans, traditionally
the most difficult to recover

141
00:10:26,576 --> 00:10:29,096
have jumped from 41 to 76%.

142
00:10:29,786 --> 00:10:33,236
These improvements are not just
numbers that represent real

143
00:10:33,236 --> 00:10:35,156
challenges for borrowers and lenders.

144
00:10:35,656 --> 00:10:42,346
When each interaction is tailored to the
individual collections become less about.

145
00:10:42,846 --> 00:10:47,106
Confrontation and more about
clear empathy communication.

146
00:10:47,706 --> 00:10:49,986
Consider the concept of
personalizing timing.

147
00:10:50,886 --> 00:10:56,816
AI systems, analyze patterns to detect
undetermined, many borrowers most

148
00:10:57,316 --> 00:10:59,456
to communications in the month.

149
00:10:59,456 --> 00:10:59,636
When.

150
00:11:00,136 --> 00:11:05,446
Later when a regular payment cycle is
able to begin by finding the optimal

151
00:11:05,446 --> 00:11:11,646
moment, the system can send a friendly
and timely reminder that resonates

152
00:11:11,646 --> 00:11:15,966
and results in positive responses
rather than a generic message that

153
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:21,051
might be ignored or cause frustrations
is also building relationship.

154
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:21,971
Borrow.

155
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:22,981
Understood.

156
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:27,801
They're most likely to engage with
the institution and work toward

157
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:29,541
resolving their financial challenges.

158
00:11:30,021 --> 00:11:36,441
The system can suggest alternative payment
plans by offering counts on managing

159
00:11:36,441 --> 00:11:42,771
finances and adopted approach as a
situation change in real time, continuous

160
00:11:43,051 --> 00:11:45,011
feedback from these interactive.

161
00:11:45,876 --> 00:11:50,466
Helps define the AI models by
ensuring that each subsequent

162
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:52,956
intervention is even more effective.

163
00:11:53,456 --> 00:11:58,186
Coming to next slide payment
processing revolution in our

164
00:11:58,306 --> 00:12:00,316
rapid evolving digital error.

165
00:12:00,436 --> 00:12:04,696
Payment processing is undergoing
a dramatic transformation.

166
00:12:05,196 --> 00:12:09,996
In the time are increasingly
unable to meet today's demands

167
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:13,796
for speed accuracy on security.

168
00:12:14,486 --> 00:12:21,506
Enter the payment processing revolution
propel by a, which is rapidly redefining

169
00:12:21,506 --> 00:12:26,146
how every transaction is executed,
conventional payments systems.

170
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:28,776
Being the backbone of
financial transactions.

171
00:12:29,226 --> 00:12:32,766
However, these systems can
be inefficient and slow.

172
00:12:33,696 --> 00:12:39,606
The rely on manual interventions
for exceptions, process transactions

173
00:12:39,606 --> 00:12:44,636
in batches, and often like the
ability required in today's

174
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,006
high speed digital economy.

175
00:12:47,506 --> 00:12:52,726
In contrast, AI enhance systems
offer a fluid adoptive approach

176
00:12:52,726 --> 00:12:56,916
by payment processing the
dramatically improved performance.

177
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:04,356
Imagine every payment being processed
as if it'll on fast track once

178
00:13:04,476 --> 00:13:05,876
your transaction is initiated.

179
00:13:06,361 --> 00:13:08,461
AI systems immediately This.

180
00:13:08,961 --> 00:13:14,151
Using a set of adapt multifactor
authentication checks, and

181
00:13:14,151 --> 00:13:17,871
comparing current details with
historical data and patterns.

182
00:13:18,561 --> 00:13:22,821
This means that transaction no longer
follow a singular predetermined route.

183
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:28,061
Instead, they are intellectually routed
through the network, along the path

184
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:33,421
that maximizes both speed and security,
in instance, where problem arises.

185
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:38,391
These systems can automatically
resolve issues by self-managing

186
00:13:39,201 --> 00:13:44,001
exceptions that would have previously
required manual interventions.

187
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:49,551
The result is like transactions
are crossed almost instantaneously

188
00:13:49,821 --> 00:13:53,091
with minimal risk of errors
or delays for businesses.

189
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:57,431
This translates to improved
customer satisfaction.

190
00:13:57,931 --> 00:14:00,751
Free payment process for
financial institutions.

191
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:05,341
The reduction in processing times
means lower operational cost

192
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:07,171
and enhanced overall efficiency.

193
00:14:08,101 --> 00:14:08,791
Every second.

194
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:14,031
Saving in processing helps build
more dynamic contrast once financial

195
00:14:14,391 --> 00:14:16,931
ecosystem alongside speed and efficiency.

196
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:21,911
The revolutions in payment processing
also introduces a new level of.

197
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:25,201
Coming to next slide,
ethical AI framework.

198
00:14:25,701 --> 00:14:30,741
Coming to ethical AI framework as
we integrate AI into every fact of

199
00:14:30,771 --> 00:14:37,311
financial security, tackling issues
of fairness, transparency, privacy,

200
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:39,686
and accountability is paramount.

201
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:42,366
Our ethical AI framework.

202
00:14:43,011 --> 00:14:48,051
Is the bedrock upon which
responsible innovations is built.

203
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:52,961
It ensures that while we leverage
sophisticated technology,

204
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:58,921
we remain steadfast in our
commitment to human values.

205
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:05,226
Fairness in AI means that every decision
made by our systems is free from our.

206
00:15:05,726 --> 00:15:11,216
Audited to prevent discrimination
across any demographic.

207
00:15:11,716 --> 00:15:18,876
By designing systems that adopt and learn
without reinforcing historical data.

208
00:15:19,296 --> 00:15:24,096
We build trust not only within
institutions, but also with our customers.

209
00:15:24,816 --> 00:15:27,606
Transparency is equally crucial.

210
00:15:28,106 --> 00:15:28,886
Every action.

211
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:34,066
An AI system must be explainable
when transaction is flagged, or

212
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,316
a loan application is deviated.

213
00:15:36,796 --> 00:15:39,016
The reason is clearly documented.

214
00:15:39,796 --> 00:15:44,706
This transparency benefits regulatory
and instills confidence among.

215
00:15:45,516 --> 00:15:46,236
Customers.

216
00:15:46,956 --> 00:15:49,056
Privacy is another
pillar of our framework.

217
00:15:49,626 --> 00:15:54,606
Financial data is highly sensitive, and
our approach guarantees that personal

218
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:56,946
information is never exposed to anyone.

219
00:15:57,516 --> 00:16:02,986
High level encryption on Strat
an normalization protocols

220
00:16:03,736 --> 00:16:05,836
ensure that data is used only to.

221
00:16:06,336 --> 00:16:09,516
Accountability is
maintained through a robust

222
00:16:10,016 --> 00:16:11,276
governance structure.

223
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:17,726
Regular review and designated
oversight committees and comprehensive

224
00:16:17,816 --> 00:16:22,376
audit trials all contribute to a
system where every decision is.

225
00:16:23,141 --> 00:16:26,171
Trackable and all stakeholders
are responsible for

226
00:16:26,891 --> 00:16:28,751
maintaining ethical standards.

227
00:16:29,251 --> 00:16:34,141
In our session today, we'll
explore how an ethical AI framework

228
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:37,501
is an obstacle to innovation.

229
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:42,561
It is the guide focus that ensures
technology serves humanity.

230
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:47,466
I will share example of institutions
adopting standard showing that.

231
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:53,376
Effective governance can coexist with
rapid technological advancements.

232
00:16:53,826 --> 00:17:00,986
When people see that decisions are made
transparently, unfairly, the trust grows.

233
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:06,656
Trust is the currency of the digital
economy under our ethical framework.

234
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:10,036
Guarantees that AI works for all of us.

235
00:17:10,536 --> 00:17:12,126
Just on responsible manner.

236
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:15,826
Coming to next slide, which
is regulatory navigation.

237
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:21,096
In this slide, navigating the regulatory
landscape in today's financial

238
00:17:21,096 --> 00:17:27,896
voltage request, both foresight and
adaptability with evolving legislations

239
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:30,026
and diverse regulations across.

240
00:17:30,526 --> 00:17:36,286
Financial institutions must be enough
to compel with new requirements

241
00:17:37,216 --> 00:17:39,526
while continuing to innovate.

242
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:47,136
A is proving to be an invaluable asset
in this regard by offering tools that.

243
00:17:47,636 --> 00:17:52,676
Not only ensure compliance, but also
enhance transparency and risk management.

244
00:17:53,126 --> 00:17:58,526
Modern AI systems can continuously
scan changes in regulatory standards

245
00:17:58,946 --> 00:18:00,476
across regions and sectors.

246
00:18:01,226 --> 00:18:06,476
They flag potential contradictions
and compliance gaps in real time.

247
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:13,396
Imagine a system that updates itself
with every new regulation published.

248
00:18:13,896 --> 00:18:19,626
Immediately adjust its risk assessment
models, ensuring all operations

249
00:18:19,716 --> 00:18:21,666
remain within legal boundaries.

250
00:18:22,116 --> 00:18:27,576
This realtime monitoring is not only
proactive, but also incredibly efficient

251
00:18:27,996 --> 00:18:32,511
by reducing the risk of non-compliance,
which could otherwise lead to costly

252
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,436
ities and reputational damages.

253
00:18:36,306 --> 00:18:37,806
Another significant benefit is.

254
00:18:38,306 --> 00:18:43,816
Every decision made by ai, whether it
involves flagging, suspicious transaction

255
00:18:43,816 --> 00:18:49,456
or processing loans is recorded with clear
documentation of reasoning behind it.

256
00:18:50,206 --> 00:18:55,696
The documentation is invaluable
during regulatory reviews as it

257
00:18:56,116 --> 00:19:00,826
shows a clear path of decision
making that regulators can follow.

258
00:19:01,326 --> 00:19:04,176
Transparent documentation,
builds trust with.

259
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:09,871
Demonstrates a commitment to
responsible ethical financial practices.

260
00:19:10,371 --> 00:19:15,101
Coming to next slide,
implementation strategy assessment.

261
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:16,501
Pilot program.

262
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:20,161
Scalable development and
continuous evolution are like

263
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:24,471
the four strategies we follow as
aspect of implementing artificial

264
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:27,021
intelligence in financial industries.

265
00:19:27,621 --> 00:19:32,661
Implementing AI driven risk management is
yet transformational journey that requires

266
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:35,301
careful planning, testing, and scaling.

267
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:40,071
The process begins with assessment of.

268
00:19:40,571 --> 00:19:45,961
During the pilot program, the focus
is on gathering data and refining the

269
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:47,911
algorithms through real world feedback.

270
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:53,991
The system is closely monitored by
enabling adjustments in the real time

271
00:19:54,411 --> 00:19:56,631
to maximize efficiency and accuracy.

272
00:19:57,131 --> 00:19:57,611
Coming to.

273
00:19:58,111 --> 00:19:58,891
Oh, sorry.

274
00:19:59,101 --> 00:20:04,861
There are two more strategies that need
to be discussed as part of this slide.

275
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:08,981
That is skill development
and continuous evolution.

276
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:12,571
We'll also examine strategies
for maintaining continuous

277
00:20:12,571 --> 00:20:14,511
evolution without within.

278
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:15,951
Your AI system.

279
00:20:16,311 --> 00:20:20,451
This means establishing feedback
loops that regularly incorporate

280
00:20:20,451 --> 00:20:25,941
new data, updating the models and
ensuring the system remains robust

281
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:28,101
in the face of evolving threats.

282
00:20:29,091 --> 00:20:30,711
The journey does not stop it.

283
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:32,511
The initial rollout.

284
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:39,591
Ongoing monitorings and regular audits and
interactive improvements ensure that AI.

285
00:20:40,091 --> 00:20:41,111
Effective and secure.

286
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:46,081
Lastly, our decision will
include practical examples from

287
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:51,331
institutions that have successfully
implemented AI driven strategies.

288
00:20:51,931 --> 00:20:56,906
These courses, studies highlights
the challenges they encountered.

289
00:20:57,406 --> 00:21:01,436
The benefits realized and
the best practice serve.

290
00:21:01,936 --> 00:21:04,426
Coming to next, last slide.

291
00:21:04,926 --> 00:21:10,466
In conclusion today we have journey
to the transformation to role of

292
00:21:10,676 --> 00:21:14,246
artificial intelligence and machine
learning and financial risk management.

293
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:21,481
We begin at Financial Frontiers
exploring how AI redefine security by

294
00:21:21,771 --> 00:21:24,281
predicting and preventing threats before.

295
00:21:24,781 --> 00:21:30,581
Current security landscape learned how
AI powered fraud detection and pattern

296
00:21:30,611 --> 00:21:35,951
recognization on real time monitoring
creates proactive defenses and witnessed

297
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:42,221
how these technologies transform process
from payments to loan collections.

298
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:47,106
We have also seen that responsible
innovations is built upon.

299
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:53,096
That emphasizes fairness, transparency,
privacy and accountability.

300
00:21:53,596 --> 00:21:58,266
Navigating the complex regulatory,
implementing AI solutions and

301
00:21:58,266 --> 00:22:03,726
continuously evolving these systems
is not just a technical challenge,

302
00:22:03,726 --> 00:22:05,726
but also cultural journey.

303
00:22:06,596 --> 00:22:11,026
Together, these breakthrough
makes our financial systems.

304
00:22:11,526 --> 00:22:13,301
And thank you everyone.
