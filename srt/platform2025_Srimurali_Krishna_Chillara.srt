1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,220
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:06,400
Welcome to this session on Engineering
Intelligence Transforming Healthcare

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,820
with BI and AI from Data to Outcomes.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,820
I'm Ali Krishna.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,005
I go by Krishna, and I'm from
the institution of Electronics

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,840
and telecommunication engineers.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:26,220
In today's talk, I'll share how platform
engineering is reshaping healthcare.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,700
Helping us turn raw, fragmented
data into intelligent insights

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,340
that drive measurable outcomes.

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:42,030
We'll explore how clinical, operational
and financial domains are converging

11
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,700
under a single vision, intelligent
healthcare systems that don't just

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,860
process data, but actively improve
care, delivery and patient experience.

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,840
Now healthcare is in the midst
of a fundamental transformation

14
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,970
driven by platform engineering.

15
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,710
For decades, hospitals struggled
with the siloed systems.

16
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,250
Data fragmentation and
inefficient workflows.

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,530
But now AI and BI form the backbone
of intelligent healthcare systems.

18
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:20,200
We are witnessing standardized integration
replacing patchwork legacy systems.

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,140
Platform engineers are the architects of
this revolution, designing systems that

20
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,580
unify diverse data and enable innovation.

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,660
Most importantly, we are moving from
technology pilots and aspirations

22
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:42,810
to measurable outcomes, reducing
costs, improving clinical accuracy,

23
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,780
and enhancing patient satisfaction.

24
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:51,480
Throughout this session, I'll show you
how these capabilities are engineered

25
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,090
at scale and how they are already
changing the healthcare ecosystem.

26
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,400
Here is the agenda, and this
is our roadmap for today.

27
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:05,479
We'll start by discussing the
current healthcare engineering

28
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:11,290
challenges, issues like a data
fragmentation, lack of interoperability

29
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,600
and integration complexity.

30
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,810
Then I'll walk you through the
BI and AI platform architecture.

31
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,320
What makes it scalable,
secure, and compliant?

32
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:29,010
Next I'll share real world case
studies where hospitals and health

33
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,230
systems achieved a measurable impact
both clinically and financially.

34
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,820
And finally, we'll wrap up with adoption
strategies and explore future paradigms

35
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,800
what healthcare intelligence might
look like in the next coming decade.

36
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,320
So let's begin.

37
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,380
The challenges.

38
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:55,700
The average health system today operates
more than 16 different platforms, and most

39
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,790
of them using incompatible data models.

40
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,810
This is a challenge.

41
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:06,250
Over 80% of healthcare data is
unstructured, locked away in physician

42
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:11,740
notes imaging or scan PDFs, and
it's growing nearly 50% every year.

43
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:18,820
On top of this, compliance frameworks
hipaa, GDPR, and new AA regulations

44
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,280
add multiple layers of complexity.

45
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,620
And when it comes to interoperability,
only 30% of hospitals have

46
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,150
achieved meaningful integration
despite regulatory mandates.

47
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,610
These engineering barriers slow down
innovation, and unless we address them.

48
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,430
Potential of healthcare
data will remain untapped.

49
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,860
Modern healthcare intelligence
platform is not a single tool.

50
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,840
It's a layered ecosystem.

51
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,270
Firstly, the data integration
layer built with the FHIR based

52
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:58,230
APIs, realtime streaming, and ETL
or E three pipelines that unify.

53
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,630
Structured and unstructured data.

54
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:08,200
Secondly the analytics processing layer
where NLP extracts meaning from text

55
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:13,100
dashboards provide actionable visibility
and machine learning models, predict

56
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:19,220
patient risk or resource needs, and
finally, the delivery infrastructure.

57
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:24,985
Ensuring secure role-based access,
seamless workflow integration and

58
00:04:24,985 --> 00:04:30,315
explainable AI so that clinicians
trust and adopt these tools.

59
00:04:30,815 --> 00:04:36,035
When all these layers come together, the
platform becomes more than a data system.

60
00:04:36,365 --> 00:04:40,120
It becomes a realtime intelligence
engine for the healthcare.

61
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,590
At the heart of modern healthcare
platforms is FHIR, which is stamped

62
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,860
as a fast healthcare interoperability.

63
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,550
Resources.

64
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,370
FHIR has become an essential standard
for healthcare integration because.

65
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:03,010
Speaks the language of today's developers
using restful API framework instead of

66
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,290
outdated rigid data exchange format.

67
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,990
And this restful API framework
is very popular and known by

68
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,150
most of today's developers.

69
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:19,790
And since the year 2021, adoption
has skyrocketed by nearly 87%.

70
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:25,180
Hospitals that use FHIR see
integration projects completed

71
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,230
63% faster than by using HL seven.

72
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,990
And critically organizations
realize over three times the

73
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,850
written on investment because data
flows more freely across systems.

74
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:45,280
FHAR is not just a technical standard,
it's the bridge that enables.

75
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:51,650
Secure, granular and scalable access to
both structured and document-based data.

76
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:58,970
It lays the foundation for everything
from clinical analytics to AI deployment.

77
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:05,140
Now, clinical intelligence covered by
AI is no longer an experimental field.

78
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,710
It's real, and it's
delivering results really.

79
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:15,050
In dermatology, AI achieves over
95% diagnostic accuracy compared

80
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,260
to 86% for human dermatologists.

81
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:25,400
In radiology, AI reduces false negatives
for lung module detection by 26%

82
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,565
directly impacting cancer diagnosis
and survival rates, and in pathology.

83
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:37,570
AI speeds diagnosis by 60%,
maintaining near perfect accuracy.

84
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,440
But these breakthroughs
don't happen in isolation.

85
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:40,500
No.

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,790
Platform engineers make them practical
by embedding AI models into clinical

87
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:51,830
workflows so that physicians see
decision support to clean their

88
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,980
systems just at their fingertips
without disrupting care delivery.

89
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,440
This is how we scale intelligence rather
than leaving it in just research labs.

90
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,920
Let's see guest study here.

91
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,540
Here's a real world
example, a medical center.

92
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,520
The emergency department faced severe
overcrowding and longboarding times,

93
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:21,475
so they built an integrated BI and AI
platform tailored for ED operations.

94
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:24,630
So the results were transformative.

95
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:31,920
Boarding time for admitted patients
dropped by 32%, and trash was accelerated

96
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,990
by 41%, powered by AI driven production.

97
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:42,130
And the system generated over $4.2
million in annual savings through

98
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,420
smarter resource utilization.

99
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,160
The key was not just
analytics, but integration.

100
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,720
We connected real time
capacity management there.

101
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:57,410
Predictive analytics and machine learning
triage into one unified platform.

102
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,210
So this is engineering intelligence
in action, solving a real operational

103
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,560
bottleneck with measurable outcomes.

104
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:10,405
Financial intelligence is another area
where AI is proving game changing.

105
00:08:10,905 --> 00:08:15,104
Revenue cycle operations traditionally
suffer from inefficiencies,

106
00:08:15,104 --> 00:08:17,775
delays, and preventable denials.

107
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:24,465
But with PI and ai, we are changing
that NLP extracts Billing critical data,

108
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:27,224
buried in unstructured clinical notes.

109
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:30,079
NLPs popular for doing this kind of task.

110
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:35,289
FLAG claims that are likely to be
denied before they're even submitted.

111
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:41,139
Automated coding ensures compliance
and maximizes the reimbursement.

112
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,719
And BA dashboards track revenue
leakage in real time, something

113
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:49,209
that used to take months to uncover.

114
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:57,669
So the impact, a 67% drop in denied
claims, a 23% boost in real claim claims.

115
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:01,329
And a 12% increase in overall revenue.

116
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:06,429
This is financial engineering
applied to healthcare, turning hidden

117
00:09:06,489 --> 00:09:10,119
insufficiency into a tangible value.

118
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:16,280
Now, one of the biggest engineering
challenge is unstructured data in

119
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,640
terms of clinical notes, discharge
summaries, referral letters.

120
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,220
Over 80% of valuable clinical
insight is hidden in these documents.

121
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:32,450
Natural language processing or NLP
allows us to extract this information

122
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:39,210
with over 92% accuracy techniques like
named entity recognition, sentimental

123
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:44,730
analysis, and medical calls of
detection term unstructured text into

124
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:48,150
structured FHIR compliant resources.

125
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:53,120
These structured insights can then
power population, health analytics,

126
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,380
quality reporting, or even AI
driven clinical decision supports.

127
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:04,250
And today's NLP pipelines
reach 94% occupant accuracy in

128
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,870
medical terminology extraction.

129
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,620
That means we are unlocking knowledge
that was once inaccessible and

130
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,540
making it available for real time.

131
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,420
Intele now.

132
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,170
Healthcare transformation is
not just about operations, it's

133
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,150
about the patient experience.

134
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,410
BI and AI enable truly
personalized engagement.

135
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:31,780
And as I have previously mentioned,
AI came into a great companion

136
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:36,115
for bi now, resulting in great
success, greater success.

137
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:42,825
So predictive care pathways, identify when
and how to intervene for each patient.

138
00:10:43,155 --> 00:10:46,995
Optimizing outcomes and
avoiding unnecessary visits.

139
00:10:47,495 --> 00:10:52,835
And NLP powered outreach
increases response rates by 78%

140
00:10:53,135 --> 00:10:54,695
compared to generic messages.

141
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:58,650
Ensuring patients are more engaged
and proactive in their care.

142
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:04,250
And AI driven virtual health assistance
provide 24 by seven triage and support.

143
00:11:04,655 --> 00:11:09,815
Reducing care while extending the
reach of clinicians nowadays, everybody

144
00:11:09,815 --> 00:11:12,515
knows is virtual health assistance.

145
00:11:12,595 --> 00:11:15,535
So picking up and very widely popular.

146
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:21,685
And together these tools enable
personalized medicine at scale,

147
00:11:22,045 --> 00:11:26,500
giving patients the right care at
the right time and in the right way.

148
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,360
And building these platforms is not easy.

149
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,340
Success depends on matching
solutions to organizational

150
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:40,410
readiness, and it is not just having
a great or high-end technologies.

151
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:45,670
Implementing these technologies
together is a real challenge.

152
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,740
And coming to the readiness of
the organizations, a low readiness

153
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,420
environment should start small, like
with small pilot programs and simpler

154
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:00,900
tools while focusing on building data
quality and cultural readiness and

155
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:06,270
high readiness organizations with
infrastructure and expertise in place can

156
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,030
go further deploying advanced analytics.

157
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,270
Machine learning and
enterprise wide intelligence

158
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,850
platforms across all settings.

159
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:19,020
The success factors are consistent,
cross-functional collaboration

160
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:23,580
between technical and clinical
teams, incremental rollouts and

161
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,450
clear ROI metrics defined upfront.

162
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:32,145
So the pitfalls are also clear, focusing
on technology instead of the problem.

163
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,690
Underestimating the importance of
data quality and failing to integrate

164
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,880
tools into clinical workflows.

165
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,730
One shouldn't ignore these things when
building systems engineering successes,

166
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,190
less about the tools themselves and
more about how we align the them with

167
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,730
the people, processes, and outcomes.

168
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:57,390
Looking ahead several emerging paradigms
will shape the next decade of healthcare

169
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,880
intelligence, federated learning.

170
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,819
Where AI models are trained across
multiple institutions without

171
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:10,490
sharing raw data, protecting privacy,
while enabling collaborations.

172
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:15,069
SOA models can be trained
in a different institution.

173
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:20,139
Different similar institution like yours,
but just without without exposing the

174
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:26,489
actual data, ambient intelligence, sensor
rich environments, the document encounters

175
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:33,149
automatically reducing the administrative
burden on clinicians and multimodal AI

176
00:13:33,749 --> 00:13:39,329
combining imaging, text sensor data, and
genomics into unified patient insight.

177
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:42,719
Creating a 360 degree view of health.

178
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:50,379
And finally, AI regulation compliance,
ensuring that every system we build is

179
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:53,410
transparent, explainable, and auditable.

180
00:13:53,949 --> 00:13:55,989
These paradigms are not futuristic.

181
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:00,579
They're already taking shape and
platform engineers will be the ones to

182
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:03,839
make the operational at school here.

183
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:07,759
We are at the end of our
presentation in the last slide.

184
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:09,469
Let's wrap up.

185
00:14:09,969 --> 00:14:10,299
Okay.

186
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:17,274
To wrap up A-F-H-A-R based integration and
standardized APIs are no longer optional.

187
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:20,479
They are the foundation of
modern healthcare platforms.

188
00:14:21,229 --> 00:14:25,579
The true measure of success is
measurable outcomes, clinical

189
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:30,529
improvements, operational efficiencies,
and financial games that prove ROI.

190
00:14:30,979 --> 00:14:36,259
And most importantly, sustainable
change comes from cross-functional

191
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:40,324
collaboration, tech technical experts,
working hand in hand clinicians to

192
00:14:40,324 --> 00:14:42,724
deliver practical, usable solutions.

193
00:14:43,224 --> 00:14:46,944
The future of healthcare engineering
is not just about building more

194
00:14:46,944 --> 00:14:50,614
advanced technology, it's just about
the building intelligent systems

195
00:14:50,614 --> 00:14:56,854
that amplify human capabilities and
transform patient outcomes at scale.

196
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:57,609
That's it.

197
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:57,999
Thank you.

198
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:01,229
Thank you all for my presentation.

199
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:02,069
Thank you.
