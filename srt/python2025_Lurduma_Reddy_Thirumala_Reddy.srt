with over 17 years of experience.

5
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:17,039
I'm excited to welcome
you all to this session.

6
00:00:17,749 --> 00:00:23,039
Today, I will be talking about how
to achieve zero downtime SAP HANA

7
00:00:23,049 --> 00:00:27,659
database using high availability
with pacemaker cluster setup.

8
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:32,639
In today's digital economy, where
system outages can cost enterprises

9
00:00:33,209 --> 00:00:34,619
millions of dollars per hour.

10
00:00:35,194 --> 00:00:40,934
Implementing robust high availability and
disaster recovery solutions for SAP HANA

11
00:00:40,934 --> 00:00:43,444
in database has become mission critical.

12
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:50,124
This presentation delivers an in
depth exploration of architecting zero

13
00:00:50,124 --> 00:00:55,994
downtime SAP HANA environments using
pacemaker cluster with a specific

14
00:00:56,004 --> 00:01:01,214
focus on performance optimized
scale up and scale out systems

15
00:01:01,304 --> 00:01:07,329
replication configurations that achieve
Subminute recovery time objectives.

16
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:12,979
In this side, we'll see, about three
pillars of SAP HANA high availability.

17
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:15,589
The first one is fault tolerance.

18
00:01:16,169 --> 00:01:22,259
Guaranteeing continuous operations through
system replication and seamless failover.

19
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,469
Minimizing downtime and
preventing data integrity.

20
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:30,989
Second one is disaster recovery,
protecting against catastrophic

21
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:35,929
events with geographically dispersed
data centers and rapid recovery

22
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:38,219
strategies for business continuity.

23
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:40,729
The third one is tenant duplication.

24
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:47,419
Managing multiple SAP HANA tenants,
also called instances, with independent

25
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:53,739
failover capabilities, enabling targeted
recovery and resource optimization.

26
00:01:54,239 --> 00:02:00,229
Here we can see how to achieve
uptime up to 99 percent with advanced

27
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:06,539
features like the first one is system
replication, ensuring high availability

28
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:12,109
by maintaining a synchronized secondary
instance ready to take over in

29
00:02:12,109 --> 00:02:13,969
case of a primary instance failure.

30
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:19,999
This technique guarantees minimal
downtime and maintains data consistency.

31
00:02:20,499 --> 00:02:22,699
Second one is active configurations.

32
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:29,139
Maximizing system utilization by allowing
read only access to the second instance.

33
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:35,149
This approach provides a performance
boost and improves resource allocation

34
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:37,409
