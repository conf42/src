1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,530
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,260
Thank you so much for being here today.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:13,170
I'm Anad Ahmed, and for the next
30 minutes we are going to be

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,900
talking about something that
sounds complicated but actually

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,240
beautifully simple, and that is it.

6
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:20,955
Aria.

7
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:26,205
We're going to try as much as possible
to like, introduce what Aria concept

8
00:00:26,205 --> 00:00:31,135
is just like a guide for developers,
share certain tips and, insights

9
00:00:31,135 --> 00:00:33,145
as to how best to understand Aria.

10
00:00:33,475 --> 00:00:35,255
And my goal is simple.

11
00:00:35,255 --> 00:00:37,485
In 30 minutes, you'll
not only underst this.

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,790
Stand what area really does, but
also know when not to use it.

13
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,590
So let's get started.

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:45,520
Yes.

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,850
What we'll be covering today in my talk

16
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,650
we are gonna be covering
the invisible problem.

17
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,349
We are, we're gonna look at the
invisible problem that makes some

18
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:03,690
websites hard to use, and then
we'll go over area fundamentals.

19
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:04,545
What is it?

20
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:07,185
What it is, and how it works.

21
00:01:07,425 --> 00:01:11,685
Then we'll unpack the three co
concepts of Aria, which is the

22
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:13,845
rows, properties, and state.

23
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:18,755
And then we'll also talk about
show we'll also show some coding.

24
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,580
Examples, a few of them.

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,940
And then we'll wrap up with the best
practices, common mistakes, testing

26
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,220
tools, and testing and tools, sorry.

27
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,630
And then action plan.

28
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,700
So by the end of this talk, you work
away not just with the knowledge,

29
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,200
but with the things that you can
actually apply in your next project.

30
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:40,560
Okay?

31
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,820
Yeah, so the invisible problem, right?

32
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,410
Accessibility issues are
really visible actually.

33
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,410
And that's one tricky part about it.

34
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,250
There are when we have
two pieces of code, right?

35
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,290
Which literally does the same thing.

36
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,020
They can look identical, but then they
be behave completely different for

37
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,270
someone using assistive technology.

38
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,250
For example, the screen reader, right?

39
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:13,869
An example of what we have
here, what you can see here is,

40
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,080
a very simple click me, right?

41
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,220
Which is designed to be a
button using the div element.

42
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:28,770
It has a class of fancy button and
unclick to do something right, but

43
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,960
it actually looks like a button.

44
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,730
Lets just put in that consent.

45
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:38,370
It was written to look like a button, but
then a screen reader would just see it

46
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,529
and just say announce it has clickable.

47
00:02:41,885 --> 00:02:47,644
Click me, but there's no
context, no role, no meaning.

48
00:02:48,064 --> 00:02:55,654
So why we see a nice button, someone using
a screen reader gets almost like no useful

49
00:02:55,654 --> 00:02:57,874
information because it just says click me.

50
00:02:57,924 --> 00:02:59,335
It has no idea.

51
00:02:59,725 --> 00:03:02,665
A screen reader has no idea
if it's actually a button.

52
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:07,195
It doesn't know what happens when you
just, when you click it, it just knows

53
00:03:07,195 --> 00:03:09,295
that there's something clickable there.

54
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:09,895
Alright?

55
00:03:10,094 --> 00:03:15,964
And that's that's the gap between
what we see and assistive technology

56
00:03:15,964 --> 00:03:20,554
understand, and that's the real
problem Har helps to bridge.

57
00:03:20,644 --> 00:03:22,804
Okay going over to the next slide.

58
00:03:25,084 --> 00:03:29,165
Like I said earlier, what is Screen
Reader one knows is like clickable

59
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:32,825
click me and it's going to translate
it as, oh, there's something you

60
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:34,894
can click here called Click me.

61
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:37,624
But I have no idea what it actually does.

62
00:03:37,714 --> 00:03:43,265
Or if it's even a button, like that's
like the translation it's gonna have so

63
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:48,825
why does it really matter to actually
like, have a proper understanding of area?

64
00:03:49,334 --> 00:03:54,524
In actual, in general context
accessibility itself is really about

65
00:03:54,534 --> 00:04:00,214
helping users gain proper understanding
of how to like, use the elements we've,

66
00:04:00,214 --> 00:04:02,494
created on our website, for example.

67
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:05,644
And it's just really about clarity, right?

68
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,174
Regardless of how a user eased.

69
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:12,464
Interfacing on interacting
with our website content.

70
00:04:12,734 --> 00:04:17,534
And it's not just about trying to click
check out a compliance checkbox or

71
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:19,634
something, or trying to avoid a lawsuit.

72
00:04:19,904 --> 00:04:21,254
No, it's not just about that.

73
00:04:21,544 --> 00:04:23,904
It's about making sure that every.

74
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,229
User, regardless of how
they access our websites can

75
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:31,109
understand and use what we build.

76
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:36,749
So when we build accessibly, we're not
just doing, we're not doing extra work.

77
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:38,129
It's not an extra work.

78
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:41,819
It's a us doing our job properly.

79
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:41,879
Okay?

80
00:04:42,884 --> 00:04:50,064
And, because a product that's confusing
or impossible to navigate is not complete.

81
00:04:50,094 --> 00:04:51,924
People would not be able to use it, right?

82
00:04:52,174 --> 00:04:55,334
So that's why it's really important
for us to understand certain

83
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:57,614
practices in accessibility.

84
00:04:57,614 --> 00:05:02,684
We should not see it as an extra
work all or is it nice to have or

85
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:05,834
I would just come, I would just
add that feature to my website.

86
00:05:05,864 --> 00:05:07,364
No, it should not be seen as that.

87
00:05:07,424 --> 00:05:07,844
Okay.

88
00:05:08,054 --> 00:05:09,614
So that's the essence of the stock.

89
00:05:09,614 --> 00:05:14,234
Like just to introduce certain
concepts that can help us bridge gaps.

90
00:05:14,384 --> 00:05:19,454
So now what I'll be talking about
next is this H TM L as you can

91
00:05:19,454 --> 00:05:23,044
see from my slide is I wrote it,
like at ML speak two languages.

92
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:27,754
So that's like a kind of an analogy I
want to go with in trying to explain

93
00:05:27,924 --> 00:05:33,974
the gap between a visual language, the
visual content user sees and say for

94
00:05:33,974 --> 00:05:37,365
example, a semantic structure or semantic.

95
00:05:37,614 --> 00:05:41,754
Content that will help assistive
technology properly interpret contents

96
00:05:41,754 --> 00:05:46,014
to users who are using assistive
technology to interact with your site.

97
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:53,385
Like I said, the visual language is, the
visual language is, let me put it this

98
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:56,174
way, it's what sighted users see, right?

99
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:59,744
There, there could be like colors,
the brand colors you have on your

100
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:04,635
site, the layouts, the animation,
the beautiful animation over effects

101
00:06:04,635 --> 00:06:09,095
and things like that have been
added and the way things behave

102
00:06:09,515 --> 00:06:11,685
naturally in terms of how you could.

103
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,690
Du those content on your website.

104
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,695
And then the second language I want
to go with is semantic language

105
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:22,515
which is what most accessibility
advocates always preach about.

106
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:26,385
It should not just be about, how
pretty your website is, but how

107
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,425
well structured your website is.

108
00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:30,855
So the second language are
we talking about is like the

109
00:06:30,855 --> 00:06:35,825
semantic language and it's what
assistive technologies interpret?

110
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:40,405
Say for example this is a
button assistive technology.

111
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,789
When it interfaces with a button,
it's going to interpret it as a

112
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:48,090
button, a well structured button
when it interfaces with a proper.

113
00:06:48,195 --> 00:06:51,885
Heading level, say for instance a
heading, this is a heading level one.

114
00:06:51,885 --> 00:06:55,905
It's gonna announce it as this is a
heading level one, this is a navigation.

115
00:06:55,955 --> 00:06:56,615
Things like that.

116
00:06:56,825 --> 00:06:59,715
So that's like the second
language, HTMO understand.

117
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:01,580
Screen reader uses most often.

118
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,550
Experiences, the semantic language.

119
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,180
That's really what helps them
in interacting and navigating

120
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,530
properly with our website.

121
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:16,265
And this actually, this, the crucial part
is these two languages, I would say are.

122
00:07:17,295 --> 00:07:18,765
They need to say the same thing.

123
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:22,315
They should not speak, they
should not be different.

124
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:26,125
They need to say the same thing
so that regardless people would

125
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,655
be able to understand the content.

126
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:32,515
So when they don't say the same thing,
but they look, when something looks

127
00:07:32,515 --> 00:07:36,585
like a button, say for example but
doesn't say it's a button semantically

128
00:07:36,585 --> 00:07:42,385
for assistive technology that's when
we can have an accessibility problem.

129
00:07:42,435 --> 00:07:46,155
Exists to make sure that those two
languages always say the same thing.

130
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:51,814
It's gives extra context to elements
when playing HTML is not enough.

131
00:07:51,894 --> 00:07:57,124
It's how we had more, let me put it
this way, semantic meaning when HML

132
00:07:57,124 --> 00:08:04,374
alone is not enough, and that's what
area is not some, complicated framework.

133
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:10,264
We need to like hard to make accessibility
to help us, do some accessibility fixes.

134
00:08:10,264 --> 00:08:15,644
No, it's just like a. A, a way
to just bridge the gap between,

135
00:08:15,694 --> 00:08:19,744
that's why I use the analogy of two
languages, the visual and the semantic.

136
00:08:20,044 --> 00:08:22,984
So where HMO is not sufficient area.

137
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:28,564
Can come in and then, had more
meaning to ensure that the ish, the

138
00:08:28,564 --> 00:08:32,164
amount starts missed, makes sense
for assistive technology users.

139
00:08:32,524 --> 00:08:35,444
So then let's like just I'm saying aria.

140
00:08:35,894 --> 00:08:43,334
Aria actually stands for, accessible
rich internet application.

141
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:43,874
Alright.

142
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:48,544
Aria is is a set of attributes
that tell assistive technology.

143
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:53,894
That what something is what it
does and what state it's in.

144
00:08:54,114 --> 00:08:55,914
That's where the three core concepts that.

145
00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:01,029
I mentioned in our agenda earlier comes
in so we'll be touching base, we'll be

146
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:03,309
touching on that later on in this talk.

147
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:09,049
Just think of, I want you to
think of area as translation notes

148
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:14,719
for screen readers that when you
like how do I want to put it?

149
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:16,639
They're just.

150
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:24,099
They're just notes that don't change
how your code should look like, but

151
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:28,499
they they're just like additional
information, like I said earlier, for

152
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:30,569
assistive technology to really understand.

153
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:36,419
So when I say role, what is that
role Is like defining what an element

154
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:39,809
is, like having more definitions,
what an element is, right.

155
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:44,399
It's announces the names and
descriptions to things like A label

156
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,349
by things we'll be covering later on.

157
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:50,759
And it also by communicates the
status and say, for instance, is

158
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:54,979
the accordion expanded or is it,
or if is the button selected?

159
00:09:54,979 --> 00:09:55,639
Things like that.

160
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:58,049
It's just like hiding more more.

161
00:09:58,569 --> 00:10:05,059
Notes for to help assistive technology
to understand better what an element is.

162
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:09,629
Like I said, think of Aria like a
translation notes, aria attributes

163
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:14,529
are, they just had more context
to, what you have as your elements.

164
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:18,759
So without translation
notes, that's the first code.

165
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,569
From what you're seeing on the screen.

166
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:24,469
The first code is, it's
designed to be a menu, right?

167
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:27,419
And it has an unclick event.

168
00:10:28,109 --> 00:10:35,159
Now that is an element, a deep
element without without aria, sorry.

169
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:39,599
And the second one is
with translational notes.

170
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:40,349
That's harrier.

171
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:44,464
In this case, we're talking we're
trying to like, give a proper

172
00:10:44,464 --> 00:10:49,324
understanding of Aria by saying,
okay, aria, similar to a translation.

173
00:10:49,384 --> 00:10:53,164
So when you see that, just know
that's what I'm trying to explain.

174
00:10:53,524 --> 00:10:58,534
So the second line, the second div
elements, which you see there, you can see

175
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:00,334
that more things are being added there.

176
00:11:00,934 --> 00:11:05,874
So the purpose of those things
are to define, a menu would

177
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,014
be like a button, right?

178
00:11:07,224 --> 00:11:07,474
So the.

179
00:11:07,674 --> 00:11:12,444
The essence of hiding area to this,
and this many element is to properly

180
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:17,214
help assistive technology to understand
that, oh, when it encounters this

181
00:11:17,214 --> 00:11:21,024
menu, it should behave as a button.

182
00:11:21,174 --> 00:11:23,094
That's the role we are defining to be.

183
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:29,524
And then the we're giving it a
label of, okay, open navigation,

184
00:11:29,594 --> 00:11:30,824
that's, what is it called?

185
00:11:30,884 --> 00:11:32,714
Like an open navigation menu.

186
00:11:33,164 --> 00:11:37,434
And so that's this is to help
more, to add more context.

187
00:11:37,434 --> 00:11:41,904
So we are going into, like diving
into the three core concepts

188
00:11:41,904 --> 00:11:44,454
that we can see at first here.

189
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:47,574
So the first concept is the role.

190
00:11:47,934 --> 00:11:53,034
The role like defines what the
element is, like I said earlier.

191
00:11:53,244 --> 00:11:58,644
So for example, like we showed in the
earlier code, it defines the code below

192
00:11:58,644 --> 00:12:01,104
as a button, even though it's a D, right?

193
00:12:01,414 --> 00:12:05,934
We added the button into the code for
it to be able to be like a button.

194
00:12:06,264 --> 00:12:09,384
So the next core concept is properties.

195
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:15,244
Properties is like a set of
characteristics that we've added for,

196
00:12:15,574 --> 00:12:21,624
elements to provide more details,
like to describe it, say for instance

197
00:12:21,624 --> 00:12:24,114
you're trying to describe your.

198
00:12:25,184 --> 00:12:30,704
Your anti blue light glasses,
you're going to have it described

199
00:12:31,094 --> 00:12:33,434
to someone, oh, it has a blue frame.

200
00:12:33,674 --> 00:12:37,904
It has a blue, lens
when it's being set up.

201
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:42,164
That kind of description, that more
details you had to your elements.

202
00:12:42,164 --> 00:12:44,864
That's where the property
concepts come in.

203
00:12:45,074 --> 00:12:49,274
So for example, in this
code, the button is given.

204
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:53,059
A property of area label and
we are telling it that, oh,

205
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:54,469
this is a closed dialogue.

206
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:55,189
All right?

207
00:12:55,609 --> 00:13:00,559
And that's like the property we are giving
it just to had more characteristics to

208
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:03,799
help describe what that element is doing.

209
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:04,279
Okay.

210
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:06,289
The next one is the states.

211
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,009
All right.

212
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:11,989
The states kind of de defines what is
currently happening with that element.

213
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:17,149
So for example, it took, it could tell
if a button is currently being selected

214
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:22,054
or, that's, if the button is active
or if, if it's press, kind of thing.

215
00:13:22,474 --> 00:13:27,844
So that's where we add the states and then
we can use that attribute there, which is

216
00:13:27,844 --> 00:13:33,934
the area pressed to be true to, to tell
that okay, the current state is what true.

217
00:13:34,184 --> 00:13:41,174
That's just like a very simple example of
how the three con concepts play together.

218
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:41,444
Okay.

219
00:13:42,164 --> 00:13:45,864
I, I've been mentioning, the
example I've been given is okay, a

220
00:13:45,864 --> 00:13:48,504
div created to act like a button.

221
00:13:48,504 --> 00:13:53,364
The reason that was used mostly
is because that is like a common

222
00:13:53,544 --> 00:13:55,764
mistake so many developers use.

223
00:13:56,004 --> 00:14:00,654
They try to use D to build everything
when you can just actually go

224
00:14:00,654 --> 00:14:02,814
ahead to use semantic HTMO.

225
00:14:02,814 --> 00:14:05,124
So that's like the golden
rule here that I'm trying to

226
00:14:05,124 --> 00:14:07,794
explain that no area is better.

227
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,849
Is better than bad area.

228
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:14,739
So the first thing first is to
always go first with the native HTML.

229
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:19,179
Always go ahead to before you
try to use div to play around

230
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:21,679
and customize setting elements.

231
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:27,959
Try to see if those elements
already exist in semantic HMR.

232
00:14:27,989 --> 00:14:28,409
Okay.

233
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,689
Use buttons for buttons.

234
00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:34,399
Use navigation nerves for navigations use.

235
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:35,649
Inputs for inputs.

236
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:39,069
Don't try to design a D to
look like an input field.

237
00:14:39,099 --> 00:14:39,549
All right?

238
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:45,009
So that's like the first step to avoiding,
future, accessibility problems because

239
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:50,279
there's some instances where we might be
trying to fix an issue an accessibility

240
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:55,199
issue, but in the actual sense, we are
even creating more accessibility issues.

241
00:14:55,469 --> 00:15:01,439
So the first golden rule is to use
native HMO first and reach, only reach

242
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:04,019
for Aria when there's no like semantic.

243
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:09,360
Elements available and don't, like I
said earlier, don't try to re employment,

244
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:13,920
build in behaviors like, like I said,
buttons, inputs and things like that.

245
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:24,720
I. When you actually really need
Aria, so use Aria components when HML

246
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,700
alone is not enough to describe it.

247
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,175
So for example, there's no
actual HML elements to say.

248
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:34,245
Carousels to, to create a carousel.

249
00:15:34,515 --> 00:15:37,515
Unlike the way we have a button
that can be used to design a

250
00:15:37,515 --> 00:15:39,835
button, a semantic HMO button.

251
00:15:40,075 --> 00:15:43,145
That's the buttoning elements that can
be used to like, build out a button.

252
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:50,635
Not nothing like that exists for tabs
or carousels or, models or navigation

253
00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:52,075
notifications and things like that.

254
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:57,205
So this is where we try to build out
some things with Ds and then style it

255
00:15:57,235 --> 00:16:03,065
into, style it for it to look like a
model or what, it could be whatever

256
00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:04,595
elements we are trying to build in mind.

257
00:16:05,315 --> 00:16:09,935
Avoid area for standard controls or
certain case cases, always test first.

258
00:16:10,005 --> 00:16:13,140
Those are also part of the things
that we need to consider when.

259
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,220
Actually deciding on when to use area.

260
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,205
So the first thing first is to use
area components when you don't have an

261
00:16:22,205 --> 00:16:28,145
alternative means to design an alternative
semantic HML, to designing that element.

262
00:16:28,145 --> 00:16:32,075
So that's like a very brief
introduction to how you can really

263
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,175
actually know when to use area.

264
00:16:34,675 --> 00:16:36,055
A few code examples.

265
00:16:36,055 --> 00:16:40,015
This is a, this is an
example of, without Aria.

266
00:16:40,645 --> 00:16:49,525
So as we can see here, the div element
is created to display a notification

267
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:53,305
message saying message sent successfully.

268
00:16:53,425 --> 00:17:00,490
But in the actual sense, no announcement
will be made if an an assistive

269
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,410
technology is trying to like, or.

270
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,940
If an assistive technology comes
in contact with this element

271
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,100
on a website there's no way.

272
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:09,650
For.

273
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,960
For a user without disability, they'll
be able to like, okay, see that.

274
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,470
Okay, that's the message, a
message successfully sent.

275
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:25,120
But a user using this assistive
technology, like a screen

276
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,020
reader would, like I said, would
definitely get no announcement.

277
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:33,760
So now looking at the second
version we've had it like three.

278
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:38,020
The three area attributes we
talked about earlier, the role, the

279
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,690
description, and the the states, right?

280
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,160
Here we had the role to
be a notification, right?

281
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,860
To give that, to.

282
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:51,085
Status sorry, that status
notification that this is a status.

283
00:17:51,295 --> 00:17:57,135
So we're trying to tell we're trying to
de define the role of this notification

284
00:17:57,135 --> 00:17:58,965
that we're building to be a status.

285
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,025
All right, so the next
one is the area life.

286
00:18:02,025 --> 00:18:04,065
So the area life is
another attribute to that.

287
00:18:04,065 --> 00:18:06,325
We used to announced sweat.

288
00:18:06,695 --> 00:18:10,835
Was subtly telling that this
should be announced pro politely.

289
00:18:11,075 --> 00:18:14,105
So that's like a characteristics
we are trying to like,

290
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:15,815
define for that notification.

291
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:22,065
And then the last one is just just
tell, okay, message send successfully.

292
00:18:22,065 --> 00:18:26,475
So that's like the actual,
content of that notification.

293
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:31,155
And these two attributes that we've
added would completely like change the

294
00:18:31,155 --> 00:18:35,415
experience of for an assistive technology.

295
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:37,035
Like it's going to give more content.

296
00:18:37,455 --> 00:18:42,555
Now the message is gonna appear, this
screen reader automatically analysis

297
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:46,685
to be like a message sent successfully
compared to the first version that we

298
00:18:46,685 --> 00:18:48,965
have on the left side of the screen.

299
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:54,245
For, users, any for users, say for
example, a user without a visual

300
00:18:54,245 --> 00:19:00,605
impairment can read the first one to
be like message sent successfully, but

301
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:07,085
then it's not helpful in any way if
a user using the assistive technology

302
00:19:07,085 --> 00:19:09,315
cannot does not get any feedback.

303
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:10,145
No response.

304
00:19:10,145 --> 00:19:10,895
No, sorry.

305
00:19:10,895 --> 00:19:12,065
No announcement.

306
00:19:12,365 --> 00:19:17,585
So this is why, this is what we are
trying to explain earlier on that those

307
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:24,225
simple changes can really make a huge
difference in how our users, our diver,

308
00:19:24,405 --> 00:19:28,755
diverse range of users get to experience,
our web content and how they're built.

309
00:19:28,755 --> 00:19:33,215
So one line of code can,
really make your heart work for

310
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:35,335
everyone, so for that's for the.

311
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:40,265
Notification and then
we have for our models.

312
00:19:40,535 --> 00:19:46,415
That's another example that I
have today to like use to further

313
00:19:46,415 --> 00:19:49,085
explain this introduction to area.

314
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:52,625
And there's always one
problem with models.

315
00:19:52,955 --> 00:20:00,425
The problem is that when a model open,
a screen reader user would not like.

316
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:05,720
Often realize that, okay, that model
has been opened or probably what

317
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,000
the model is for or how to close it.

318
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,260
All right?

319
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,190
And visually.

320
00:20:12,565 --> 00:20:15,235
When we talk about the
visual language, it's there.

321
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:15,835
Okay.

322
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:20,795
It's opened, but then on, for, on the
screen reader side, it'll not see it.

323
00:20:21,035 --> 00:20:25,500
There's a, there's an X to close it,
but then the screen reader will not also

324
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,860
see it if it's not properly announced
correctly or the rules are not giving.

325
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,260
They're not like added or not even, or.

326
00:20:35,175 --> 00:20:40,995
Or they're not added, or they're
added and not added correctly.

327
00:20:41,145 --> 00:20:43,125
So that's another case, right?

328
00:20:43,255 --> 00:20:47,845
The solution here is to like,
add a couple of area attributes.

329
00:20:47,905 --> 00:20:52,255
So the first one is here
we are given a model here.

330
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,170
Role of a dialogue.

331
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:58,190
So that's like the role we are defining so
that whenever a screen reader encounters

332
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,640
that element, you don't understand
that, oh, this is a mod dialogue.

333
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,330
Okay.

334
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,610
And then the next one is the area
labeled by, which is, which falls

335
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,740
under the properties concept.

336
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:15,190
So this is the, like the characteristics
we're trying to define for it, and we're

337
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:20,260
saying that, oh, the aerial labeled by
points to the heading the selves as the.

338
00:21:20,645 --> 00:21:22,115
Dialogue title.

339
00:21:22,475 --> 00:21:28,985
So we are going to be pointing
like that property to the heading.

340
00:21:29,165 --> 00:21:33,415
Alright, so then the, another
description we're giving it is the

341
00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:36,475
ariel described by, so those are like.

342
00:21:36,535 --> 00:21:38,985
Pretty much setting quick references.

343
00:21:39,315 --> 00:21:42,315
At the end of this talk, I'm going
to show some quick references that

344
00:21:42,315 --> 00:21:46,375
you can always like, follow through
to help you further understand that,

345
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,955
okay, yes, this is what this is.

346
00:21:48,955 --> 00:21:53,045
And there also a couple of more resources
that I'm gonna be sharing so that I can

347
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:56,305
have more, context to aerial elements.

348
00:21:56,305 --> 00:21:59,485
For the area described by
Yeah, we are saying that.

349
00:21:59,515 --> 00:21:59,875
Okay.

350
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:05,695
This p elements would serve as the
description for our, for our model,

351
00:22:05,695 --> 00:22:08,615
so that when it's announced, the
screen reader knows, okay, this

352
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:11,825
is what this model is meant for.

353
00:22:12,215 --> 00:22:16,835
And, with the title the screen
reader, user can, get a preview

354
00:22:16,985 --> 00:22:19,905
idea or, a short idea of, okay.

355
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,985
What this model is about.

356
00:22:22,325 --> 00:22:24,545
And that will be like,
okay, confirm the needs.

357
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:29,675
So when it announces it as confirm,
delete model the screen reader user

358
00:22:30,155 --> 00:22:33,575
knows and it's prepared that, okay,
this is for me to delete something.

359
00:22:33,575 --> 00:22:33,935
Alright.

360
00:22:34,335 --> 00:22:37,305
And then it gives that more
context to description of the.

361
00:22:37,385 --> 00:22:41,525
Dialogue to be, okay, are you
sure you want to delete this item?

362
00:22:41,525 --> 00:22:42,905
So that's really helpful.

363
00:22:42,955 --> 00:22:48,095
Just those two descriptions is adding
more context to help, improve the

364
00:22:48,095 --> 00:22:49,955
experience of a screen reader user.

365
00:22:50,705 --> 00:22:53,975
And then a couple of other elements
there is just cancel and then delete.

366
00:22:53,975 --> 00:22:58,620
So if the user is still gonna go
ahead to delete, they know like how

367
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,790
to move their, cause how to move
their keyboard around to help them

368
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:06,710
navigate to the delete section if they
still want to delete or just go back.

369
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:11,340
So just those few things helps,
compared to not even hiding

370
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,630
any of those things at all.

371
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,640
And just having your div and then.

372
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,580
H two and then a P tag and
then the two buttons and style

373
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,290
beautifully in the modal box.

374
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:26,260
It's cute visually, but then functionally
it does not help, screen reader users.

375
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,670
Yeah.

376
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,860
That's like the purpose.

377
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,830
And then we are, trying to provide more
context for screen reader as like I

378
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:37,060
said, so the common mistake, I think I
mentioned one common mistake earlier,

379
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,830
but so many developers aside from okay.

380
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,260
I think I mentioned the common mistake
the other time I remember now the common

381
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:50,600
mistake I mentioned was using Ds to
create buttons and we've already talked

382
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,690
about how not to do that, so we should
always use like semantic, some of us.

383
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:56,500
So that's great.

384
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:02,830
Then another common mistakes
is adding Harry to everything.

385
00:24:03,205 --> 00:24:04,675
Every single element.

386
00:24:05,365 --> 00:24:11,155
And that's not great because when you
add Aria or use Aria when you're not

387
00:24:11,155 --> 00:24:16,375
supposed to, like I said earlier, that's
like adding more accessibility problems,

388
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:20,005
like creating more accessibility problems
rather than fixing those problems.

389
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:23,585
Another one is adding
I interactive elements.

390
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:27,695
Like I sometimes when I like click
on the, I inspect of certain website,

391
00:24:27,695 --> 00:24:32,615
I see area eating true and I'm like,
no, that's like a common, that's

392
00:24:32,615 --> 00:24:34,475
one mistake that people also make.

393
00:24:34,525 --> 00:24:35,875
Developers not.

394
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,950
I lo like forgetting keyboard support.

395
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:43,030
Aria usually doesn't have
keyboard functionality.

396
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:48,290
So we still need things like, our on click
events and keyboard atlas and things like

397
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,460
that to help, with keyboard functionality.

398
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,060
So we should not think Aria
is going to like, have those

399
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,470
things for us automatically.

400
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,300
They're not, they don't work that way.

401
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,520
We already explain like.

402
00:25:00,015 --> 00:25:04,515
Why, what area does just
adding more context, right?

403
00:25:04,515 --> 00:25:08,475
So we should have that notes like
adding more context to help screen

404
00:25:08,475 --> 00:25:13,845
reader understand certain elements that
are not built with semantic H demo.

405
00:25:13,905 --> 00:25:16,065
So that's like the best
way to break it down.

406
00:25:16,345 --> 00:25:20,810
Also, I think I mentioned this
conflicting rules or invalid states.

407
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,940
Maybe for a button we are.

408
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,230
Assigning is a role of a dialogue, right?

409
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,750
That's like creating an
accessibility problem.

410
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,070
Or, giving a dialogue role of a bot team.

411
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:36,850
There are other different rules that
we can always like reference on the MDN

412
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:40,420
documentation or altering practices yeah.

413
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,190
By Y area.

414
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:42,570
Yeah.

415
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,400
Like I said, those common mistakes,
yes, they're, they have solutions.

416
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,630
So the fix will be to always use the
semantic H number and then we test with

417
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:56,240
our keyboards to ensure that, users
can also can, navigate with a keyboard

418
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:59,790
without the mouse and then test with
screen without, to ensure that okay,

419
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,740
these things are announcing correctly.

420
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,620
So there are tools and tests
tools and technologies that we

421
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,120
can use to do those testing.

422
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,270
Like I put here, we should
do the keyboard test first.

423
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:12,990
Navigate without your mouse
and ensure that the focus is

424
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,540
visible and logical, right?

425
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:20,550
Yeah, that's just unplugging your mouse
and try to navigate with your keyboard.

426
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,990
Can you navigate everything?

427
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,100
Can you activate it?

428
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:23,700
Yeah.

429
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:27,640
And then are they focus around
your elements, like your buttons?

430
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:32,850
Does they have enough focus that that will
help, assistive technology users as well?

431
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,560
Also there are screen readers
you can always download NVDA, you

432
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,880
can download on Windows, but Mark
itself comes with a voiceover, so

433
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,260
you don't need to download those.

434
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:48,780
Just listen, just use this screen reader
tools to help you listen to how your

435
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,760
page is being announced or described.

436
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:55,590
And then there are also automated
tools that you can use to check

437
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,260
where check for errors on your site.

438
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:04,000
Maybe just to check and spot if you
can find area errors or no area errors.

439
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,710
And it could be any other errors, right?

440
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,060
So you shouldn't wear,
you're testing your site.

441
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,830
Don't just test for the area, okay?

442
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:12,270
Just go through everything and
ensure that everything works.

443
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:12,850
Okay.

444
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,530
So yeah, baby steps.

445
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,590
Slow.

446
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:19,430
Like I used to hear, slow progress
is better than no progress at all.

447
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:24,350
So it's not like a one day thing
to get it all right all at once.

448
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:29,325
It's tiny changes that could yield
remarkable results that could, provide

449
00:27:29,805 --> 00:27:34,085
impactful changes to help, improve
the experiences of our users, right?

450
00:27:34,325 --> 00:27:39,865
So automated tools like, ask step tools,
wave a Lighthouse could help spot those

451
00:27:39,865 --> 00:27:45,435
issues and then you can look at how to
fix them and, try to retest again manually

452
00:27:45,495 --> 00:27:47,595
and see if everything works correctly.

453
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,885
I was talking about quick references.

454
00:27:49,915 --> 00:27:51,895
There are a couple of roles that.

455
00:27:52,855 --> 00:27:57,595
These are like common area attributes
that you mostly use all the time

456
00:27:57,755 --> 00:28:04,715
buttons navigations, dialogue, alert
status, remember, don't go first

457
00:28:04,835 --> 00:28:07,415
using a div to create a button.

458
00:28:07,445 --> 00:28:07,895
Okay?

459
00:28:08,405 --> 00:28:11,135
Always go for the semantic
way of creating a button.

460
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:11,615
Okay?

461
00:28:11,965 --> 00:28:16,735
That's like a quick reference for roles,
a quick reference for labels, for,

462
00:28:16,835 --> 00:28:22,685
properties, adding properties like, we
had the A built by in one of our examples.

463
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,940
And then we use our IDs to target them.

464
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,190
I think I, we have that
in one of our examples.

465
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:33,950
The area described by, like I said,
we had in our example, a mod example

466
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:37,460
where we had a Peter to provide
more context, more description.

467
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,940
So we use the area described
by and target targeted.

468
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:45,150
It's using the ID and added
that inside of our, that's that

469
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,770
a quick reference for state.

470
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,280
Okay.

471
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,170
Is it an expanded one?

472
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,490
Is it open?

473
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:50,970
Do you get it?

474
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:51,660
Is it closed?

475
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:57,340
Using are expanded setting to
true or false or are selected

476
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,290
certainly to true or false.

477
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:03,350
These are, ways, these are quick
references, like the Area Aid

478
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,380
true or false that we mentioned
for interactive elements.

479
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:10,280
That is so that's why I said that it's
a common mistake because there's so many

480
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,940
elements that developers can, would just
go ahead to put Area Aid to be true.

481
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:20,380
Just so that it's to fix to fix maybe
an accessibility issue they're trying

482
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,700
to encounter something like that.

483
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:25,800
That, that area, ed didn't mostly say,
oh, should query reader ignore it.

484
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,950
It should always be used
correctly and right.

485
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,585
This is the, another one quick
reference for live regions.

486
00:29:32,585 --> 00:29:34,385
That's all still on the properties.

487
00:29:34,685 --> 00:29:36,725
The area live should be announced.

488
00:29:37,685 --> 00:29:42,335
It's politely or ative, like
announce immediately or announce

489
00:29:42,335 --> 00:29:45,845
when I do just to provide more
characteristics to that element.

490
00:29:45,845 --> 00:29:49,595
We're trying to create where
plain HTMO is not sufficient.

491
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:55,015
Alright so when we are trying to do
these steps, this, baby steps, we're

492
00:29:55,015 --> 00:29:59,755
learning, we're growing, we are, trying
to, as much as possible ensure that.

493
00:30:00,595 --> 00:30:03,025
Our websites are content accessible.

494
00:30:03,295 --> 00:30:07,465
We also, it's also very important
to build an accessible workflow.

495
00:30:07,665 --> 00:30:11,865
We should not always make accessibility
to be something that should be considered

496
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:16,635
when our site has launched and our users
are complaining that, oh, they cannot

497
00:30:16,635 --> 00:30:18,825
access certain things in our website.

498
00:30:18,825 --> 00:30:22,905
No, it should always built, it should
always be built from the very beginning.

499
00:30:23,205 --> 00:30:26,355
Start semantic, then hands with Aria.

500
00:30:26,455 --> 00:30:32,225
When you want to build elements
that plain HCMO does not suffice.

501
00:30:32,225 --> 00:30:37,895
Then also adding, accessibility
checkers to to accessibility checks,

502
00:30:37,895 --> 00:30:41,685
sorry, to our pool request should
also automate certain things.

503
00:30:41,685 --> 00:30:46,945
And why you automate is also important
to also test mal d. Just like going

504
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:50,675
through checking manually to see
if everything announces correctly.

505
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:55,445
And it's also important to like,
include accessibility testing into

506
00:30:55,685 --> 00:30:57,365
things like our design system.

507
00:30:57,695 --> 00:31:00,875
So when all of this is part
of our process, it stops

508
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,655
looking like an extra work.

509
00:31:02,865 --> 00:31:04,395
Oh, it's an extra work.

510
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:05,595
I can't do that, kind of thing.

511
00:31:05,955 --> 00:31:08,715
So yeah, so that's why
it's really important.

512
00:31:08,955 --> 00:31:12,765
So another thing is another action
plan, I would say aside from building.

513
00:31:12,865 --> 00:31:16,225
Accessibility into our workflow
is that we should keep learning.

514
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:20,585
We should read why area practices,
authoring practices about area,

515
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:22,475
to learn more and build more.

516
00:31:22,575 --> 00:31:23,865
Nobody knows it all.

517
00:31:23,985 --> 00:31:27,575
Quick insights, knowledge
about certain things is really

518
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:29,705
helpful than not knowing at all.

519
00:31:29,705 --> 00:31:34,325
So it's very important as professionals,
as developers, we should learn about this.

520
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:35,285
Best practices.

521
00:31:35,555 --> 00:31:39,215
We should also audit and we
should test our keyboard flow.

522
00:31:39,215 --> 00:31:41,375
We should run, ask step tools.

523
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:45,495
We should, fix stuff with, I impact
issues like, issues that you know,

524
00:31:45,495 --> 00:31:47,325
that are really impacting our users.

525
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,515
We should start with those.

526
00:31:49,815 --> 00:31:52,395
We should also like sustain, keep.

527
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,880
Accessibility into our
PR and review processes.

528
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,810
It's just like those small steps
that will really make a huge impact.

529
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:04,385
So my key takeaway, the key takeaways
here is what I want you to really

530
00:32:04,385 --> 00:32:10,005
remember is that area should not be
like, or, checklist or, things like that.

531
00:32:10,005 --> 00:32:11,355
It's about respect.

532
00:32:11,685 --> 00:32:15,345
It's about respecting that people
use the web in different ways

533
00:32:15,645 --> 00:32:17,535
and it's about ensuring that.

534
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,510
What you build is usable by everyone.

535
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:21,960
Okay.

536
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:26,720
And it's not just the web has
we personally experienced.

537
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,440
It's like it's about building
for the real diverse users.

538
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:30,830
Alright?

539
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,030
Every area attribute you
write is an act of inclusion.

540
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,360
Every area attribute you
write is an act of inclusion.

541
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,530
Those done the right way.

542
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:39,920
Okay?

543
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,250
So it has to be done the right
way for you to write something

544
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,510
that's an act of inclusion.

545
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:49,780
That's the art of accessibility, making
sure that every user's feel what included.

546
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,670
Yeah that's it.

547
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:56,500
And then we have a couple of resources,
like I said, that would be added

548
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:58,450
to the end of this co this talk.

549
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:01,160
The Y area altering best practices.

550
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,540
You can always visit that to see a
list of more area properties road.

551
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:08,310
Yeah, states that you can, learn to use.

552
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:13,420
We also have the MDN area documentation
is also a very detailed documentation

553
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,310
that explains, more area concepts.

554
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:19,510
We also have the web aim article
on area, like I think web aim

555
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:23,640
had a very detailed at school and
area, which I've included here.

556
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,060
And then I also linked to a couple of
resources sorry, a couple of tools that

557
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:33,650
was mentioned earlier, which is like
the Ask Dev two, the NVDA and the Wave.

558
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:34,280
Okay.

559
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,170
That's it for me.

560
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,570
If you have any questions,
just send it to me.

561
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:41,860
I'll be more than willing to
answer to the best way I can.

562
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,580
Thank you so much for listening.
