00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,400
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:06,529
I am Ankita Saxena, senior project
manager at Amazon and alumni

3
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:08,059
of Carnegie and University.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:13,820
I work on AI driven products and
focus on recommendation systems and

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,020
how these are shaping both customer
experiences and business strategy.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,794
Today, I will walk all of you through
how these systems have evolved over

7
00:00:22,794 --> 00:00:29,775
time and from just, you may also
like feature, it has become a core

8
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:36,254
infrastructure of multiple industries,
powering their business decision making

9
00:00:36,254 --> 00:00:38,415
and improving their customer engagement.

10
00:00:38,915 --> 00:00:44,525
So we interact with recommendation system
almost every day when Netflix suggests

11
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:47,660
you a show based on your viewing pattern.

12
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:54,125
Or Spotify starts building your
playlist or website, highlighting

13
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,655
what we may like the next.

14
00:00:56,155 --> 00:01:01,285
These all feel very simple features,
but there's lot of intelligence behind

15
00:01:01,285 --> 00:01:03,505
them in transforming industries,

16
00:01:04,005 --> 00:01:10,640
and these are, that INT intelligence
system is now empowering the core,

17
00:01:10,995 --> 00:01:13,245
core business infrastructure of.

18
00:01:13,745 --> 00:01:16,945
Different industry areas.

19
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:23,245
So we'll today we'll talk about how
this sim how from simple suggestion

20
00:01:23,245 --> 00:01:29,325
to strategic infrastructure this
has changed the four different

21
00:01:29,325 --> 00:01:32,820
industry and what is its application
across different industries.

22
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,809
We'll talk about e-commerce platforms,
streaming services, digital retail

23
00:01:39,139 --> 00:01:43,609
and enterprise marketplace, the
same technology, how it is adopted

24
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:45,529
across very different industry.

25
00:01:46,309 --> 00:01:51,559
So let's go deeper into the each
industry and how the recommendation

26
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:56,329
system works and how it is impacting
the different aspects of the

27
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:57,619
business decision making there.

28
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:00,609
Let's start with
e-commerce platform first.

29
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:02,190
In E-commerce.

30
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,630
Now the system, the recommendation
system has evolved beyond the production.

31
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:11,060
For example, if customer is
frequently buying a what certain

32
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:17,880
kind of reusable water bottle, along
with a fitness care, the systems

33
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,955
forced that pattern leading to.

34
00:02:20,685 --> 00:02:25,995
Leading retailer to bundle them or
increase supply or actually create

35
00:02:26,055 --> 00:02:27,495
their own private level brand.

36
00:02:28,275 --> 00:02:29,565
That's the business inside.

37
00:02:29,595 --> 00:02:34,365
Now, the system gives you the
engine, and this way the engine is

38
00:02:34,365 --> 00:02:38,805
shaping both the customer experience
and inventory decision making.

39
00:02:39,555 --> 00:02:44,805
Let's go deeper into how the entire
technical architecture works in

40
00:02:44,805 --> 00:02:47,165
e-commerce for the recommendation.

41
00:02:47,665 --> 00:02:51,715
So the recommendation to architecture
in commerce starts with data collection

42
00:02:52,025 --> 00:02:56,435
where real time capture of user
behavior, transaction and contextual

43
00:02:56,705 --> 00:03:01,445
ness gets collected when customer
is interacting on the platform.

44
00:03:02,075 --> 00:03:06,845
And then use with the collaborative
filtering, the item to item analysis

45
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:10,715
happens, identifying what are
the purchase pattern, what is the

46
00:03:10,715 --> 00:03:13,385
product affinities for the customer.

47
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:18,050
Which gets feed fed into the
personalization engine, which is like

48
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:23,360
dynamic recommendation generation,
tailored to individual user profiles.

49
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:30,490
And the aggregation of these insights
give gets fed into the business

50
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:38,110
intelligence which helps businesses into
inventory planning, supplier management.

51
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,480
Even the product development decisions.

52
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:46,200
So just think about if be shoppers,
view a jacket, but don't buy it.

53
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:52,470
That system will flag it as a friction,
and the team may respond by either

54
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:59,160
adjusting price, improving the images, or
testing new messaging of the jacket to the

55
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,130
customer to improve the conversion ratio.

56
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,320
Now let's move into the next industry,
which is a streaming platform.

57
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,789
Streaming platform is focused
on hyper personalized discovery,

58
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,649
unlike the e-commerce platform.

59
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:22,769
And it is more complex because it not only
look at collaborative filtering, it looks

60
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:25,699
at MicroGen genre metadata tagging, and.

61
00:04:26,524 --> 00:04:31,774
Multimodal analysis using visual
element audio characteristics, narrative

62
00:04:31,774 --> 00:04:35,524
structure, plot content, and many more.

63
00:04:36,024 --> 00:04:41,214
And what this recommendation supports
and helps with it guides the investment

64
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:46,864
decisions the production decisions,
regions acquisition targets for licensing

65
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:52,474
deals, and help platform understand
which genres and formats will resonate

66
00:04:52,474 --> 00:04:54,514
with specific audiences and sector.

67
00:04:54,514 --> 00:04:54,604
Yes.

68
00:04:55,104 --> 00:05:00,684
So just think about if the millions
of your customers are viewing or binge

69
00:05:00,684 --> 00:05:06,234
watching light-hearted comedy drama
content platform will definitely invest

70
00:05:06,234 --> 00:05:10,824
more in that styles because the data
reveals there is a long term demand

71
00:05:11,154 --> 00:05:15,444
and which can eventually convert into
a long time customer lifetime value.

72
00:05:16,314 --> 00:05:20,784
So the recommender drives both
user engagement because customer.

73
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,519
The person, the customer is
seeing what they want to see.

74
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:29,939
And obviously business investment
because now customer business is

75
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:34,409
super clear on where to invest to
get more value out of the customer.

76
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,199
The most interesting piece of this is how
the multi-model analysis recommendation

77
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,279
system works and what is the detail of it.

78
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:48,584
So when you look at multi-model
analysis in streaming.

79
00:05:49,084 --> 00:05:50,764
It does collaborative filtering.

80
00:05:50,974 --> 00:05:55,774
It has a collaborative filtering layer,
which where it analyzes viewing patterns

81
00:05:55,834 --> 00:06:00,905
across millions of users to identify
content with similar audience appeal.

82
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:06,514
Then it goes to micro genre metadata,
like which is grammar tagging

83
00:06:06,514 --> 00:06:10,684
system, creating thousands of content
categories beyond traditional genre.

84
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:17,180
For example romantic is a traditional
genre, but it'll go more deeper into.

85
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:23,330
Romantic with multiple
couples and a Christmas team.

86
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,320
That's the granularity.

87
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:24,950
It goes on.

88
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:32,220
Then it analyzes video and visual
and audio and signals which uses

89
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,300
computer vision and audio processing
and attract extra characteristics like

90
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,750
cinemagraphic style, pacing, and mood.

91
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:44,560
Just think about, if the system
sees a viewer prefers a warm color

92
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,350
balance and slower pacing, it
recommends visually similar shows.

93
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:55,260
Even if the story is different, it
goes far beyond clicks to understand

94
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,060
aesthetic preference of the customer,
and that's where you bring in lot

95
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,560
of engagement from the customer.

96
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,955
And then the narrative structure mapping
na, natural language processing analysis.

97
00:07:07,685 --> 00:07:11,165
Plot elements, themes, and
character ask for deeper matching.

98
00:07:11,885 --> 00:07:17,615
That's how the entire multimodal analysis
happens, which gives a hyper personalized

99
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:20,045
recommendation to the customer.

100
00:07:20,545 --> 00:07:26,050
Now, my most favorite, the digital
retail deal, and I will talk

101
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,300
more about the fit uncertainty.

102
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,210
Because that's the biggest pain point as
of now in the digital retail industry.

103
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:39,679
And obviously a misfit product ends
up into a poor customer experience,

104
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:44,480
lesser customer engagement, and
obviously higher return rates

105
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,309
impacting the company's revenue.

106
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:49,544
So this recommendation system.

107
00:07:50,254 --> 00:07:54,874
Where we use visual similarity
algorithms and ar try-on capabilities

108
00:07:55,204 --> 00:07:58,264
is surely helping to solve this problem.

109
00:07:58,764 --> 00:08:04,734
So just think about if a shopper uses
virtual try ons for sneakers, the model

110
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:10,104
will suggest styles that match their
first shape and past certain behavior.

111
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:15,984
This reduce uncertainty, the number of
decision points a customer has to take.

112
00:08:16,645 --> 00:08:20,214
And obviously in town reduces the returns

113
00:08:20,714 --> 00:08:27,574
and the impact of this recommendation
system on digital retail is phenomenal.

114
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:33,444
It improves the conversion rates,
obviously reduced reduction rate.

115
00:08:33,924 --> 00:08:38,485
We have seen a reduction of
almost five to 8% in return rates.

116
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:43,224
Wherever we are using the visual
similarity or virtual try on features.

117
00:08:44,094 --> 00:08:50,005
And in turn, this has improved our
conversion rate by 15 to 25% on

118
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:56,094
average across the different digital
retailers, which, and it made customer

119
00:08:56,094 --> 00:09:00,385
really happy because now they are
able to get better fitting, more

120
00:09:00,385 --> 00:09:02,984
relevant alternatives without much.

121
00:09:03,484 --> 00:09:04,684
Multiple returns,

122
00:09:05,184 --> 00:09:08,244
and obviously this
improves the engagement.

123
00:09:08,694 --> 00:09:11,334
A very interesting engagement data.

124
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:15,984
We, what we have seen is because customer
is seeing a lot of visually similar

125
00:09:15,984 --> 00:09:22,184
item, it ended up engaging more and
the session duration has gone up about

126
00:09:22,184 --> 00:09:25,964
20, 30% wherever the visual similar.

127
00:09:26,324 --> 00:09:32,324
Recommendation system is being used,
and obviously more session time directly

128
00:09:32,324 --> 00:09:37,694
converts into increased order value,
which is in the tune of eight to 12%,

129
00:09:37,904 --> 00:09:40,389
which is a huge impact to the p and l.

130
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:45,199
And then the last, the fourth
one, the enterprise marketplaces,

131
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:47,299
which is a two-sided optimization.

132
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:52,729
My optimization system, and I will
say it is the most complex of.

133
00:09:53,229 --> 00:09:59,439
Any recommendation system because it
has to work in a multi-agent reach for

134
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:02,169
reinforcement learning environment.

135
00:10:02,859 --> 00:10:08,799
It, the agent has to not only optimize
for the buyer, it has to optimize

136
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,989
for the supplier as well, and that
is where the complexity comes in.

137
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:18,114
Let's dig deeper into how this
two-sided optimization system works.

138
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:21,724
And what is the benefits of using this?

139
00:10:22,224 --> 00:10:25,974
So this multi-agent reinforcement
learning architecture works

140
00:10:25,974 --> 00:10:27,624
on four different components.

141
00:10:28,134 --> 00:10:34,134
There is a seller agent, which works on
maximizing visibility to qualified buyers

142
00:10:34,164 --> 00:10:36,714
while managing inventory efficiency.

143
00:10:37,374 --> 00:10:42,084
Then another one is a platform agent,
which balances marketplace health,

144
00:10:42,624 --> 00:10:44,574
liquidity, and long-term sustainability.

145
00:10:45,074 --> 00:10:50,444
And then the re regulatory agent, which
ensures compliance within regional laws,

146
00:10:50,864 --> 00:10:53,054
logistics and payment requirements.

147
00:10:53,624 --> 00:10:57,884
And the fourth one, the buyer agent
optimizes for relevant supplier

148
00:10:57,884 --> 00:11:00,764
discovery and best value matches.

149
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:06,194
One of the great example you can
think about is if a wire wants low

150
00:11:06,194 --> 00:11:10,724
shipping cost, but a seller wants
to clear the access inventory.

151
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:16,739
The system learns to pair the buyer
with the nearby supplier to satisfy both

152
00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:23,979
sides, which is like optimizing for the
both the agents and the agent balances

153
00:11:23,979 --> 00:11:29,019
competing, goes very intelligently
benefiting both and creating a win-win

154
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:31,839
situation for both s seller and the buyer.

155
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:34,539
That's the impact of the
recommendation system.

156
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,449
So another example is if the system
deducts there is a rising interest in

157
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:44,489
sustainable products, then it gives
a recommendation to the product teams

158
00:11:44,489 --> 00:11:50,159
to expand that category, and marketing
shifts to the messaging and the

159
00:11:50,219 --> 00:11:52,139
insight flow across the entire system.

160
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:56,569
That's how the entire recommendation
system impacts the businesses.

161
00:11:57,069 --> 00:12:02,619
So I would say, the entire
recommendation system has multiple

162
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:08,969
business impacts across operational
excellence delivering a lifetime

163
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:11,219
customer value and revenue impact.

164
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:16,234
So you may think about when it
comes to operational excellence,

165
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:20,479
the recommendations system
helps supply chain optimization.

166
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:26,209
When it comes to demand forecasting,
inventory management, which is all driven

167
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:32,449
by recommendation patterns, same for the
resource allocation, like where we should

168
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:36,799
invent for invest for the content, if
it's a streaming services or what should

169
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,579
be the green field areas for the new
product development, where we are seeing

170
00:12:40,674 --> 00:12:46,939
a huge demand, but lower conversion and
the patterns, there are common product

171
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,729
feature patterns under each demand.

172
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,930
And where should we expand the
market Next, what should be

173
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,579
our new next private level?

174
00:12:56,119 --> 00:12:59,420
And obviously, and the most
important is efficiency gains.

175
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:05,630
We with the recommendations digital
system, we remove all the dependency

176
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:11,119
on manual search and all the friction
and lowering the transition cost.

177
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:15,574
And then if we focus on the
customer value with the.

178
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:20,979
Better recommendations and the
products which customer is looking for.

179
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,449
You bring a lot of retention.

180
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:26,549
You improve customer retention and
loyalty and creates a personalized

181
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:32,309
experiences for the customers, which
gives you a lot of competitive edge and

182
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:34,199
definitely the revenue optimization.

183
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:37,109
You can do cross selling, upselling.

184
00:13:37,469 --> 00:13:40,729
You can discover the new
revenues work revenue streams.

185
00:13:41,164 --> 00:13:42,994
Using the recommendation system.

186
00:13:43,684 --> 00:13:48,779
For example, if two different products
are bought all the time together, you

187
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:53,129
can bundle it and sell it, cross sell
it to the same customer, and under the

188
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:57,749
recommendation system, and the most
important, the market intelligence,

189
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:02,479
it gives very deep insights into the
customer behavior, what customer is

190
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:08,269
looking for, and what's the new product
we should be building, which customer?

191
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:11,989
Think of, but not finding as of now.

192
00:14:12,489 --> 00:14:17,800
So to summarize the recommendation
system is redefining the

193
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:23,920
personalization as a core foundation
layer of all the businesses.

194
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,579
So it's no longer just a
small feature recommendation.

195
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:29,649
It has become a fundamental architecture.

196
00:14:30,564 --> 00:14:36,024
Powering business operations and it
is a cross-functional integration.

197
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:43,454
So once we have this foundation up
and running, it not only impacts one

198
00:14:43,454 --> 00:14:49,534
section, supply chain, it, or marketing
plan, it impacts the insights of this

199
00:14:49,594 --> 00:14:54,274
recommendation system flows across all
the sites of the business, marketing,

200
00:14:54,274 --> 00:14:56,344
supply chain, product development.

201
00:14:57,019 --> 00:15:02,099
Business strategy, customer ag engagement,
all of the functions of the business.

202
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:08,719
And once you start working backwards
from the customer, obviously it

203
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:10,639
creates a competitive differentiation.

204
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,930
Superior personalization creates a
defensible mode through a network

205
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:18,309
effect and advantages the same percent.

206
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:21,609
It becomes a foundation and not a feature.

207
00:15:22,109 --> 00:15:27,599
And I would say companies that understand
behavior at scale, deliver more relevant

208
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:32,459
experiences, creating an advantage,
that new customer can't easily copy

209
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:38,639
that it, and that insights become a
strategic mode because you are the

210
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,169
one who knows your customer the best.

211
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:44,779
To end with AI powered recommendation
system represents the convergence

212
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:49,219
of customer experience excellence,
and a strategic business

213
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:52,069
intelligence organization.

214
00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:56,389
And the organization that mastered
this convergence will define the

215
00:15:56,444 --> 00:16:01,454
competitive landscape of their
industries in the near future.

216
00:16:01,954 --> 00:16:03,880
So the strategic imperative is clear.

217
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:05,704
Recommendation system must be viewed.

218
00:16:06,305 --> 00:16:11,224
Not as isolated technical
implementation, but as integrated

219
00:16:11,614 --> 00:16:15,904
business platform that drive
decisions across entire organization.

220
00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:21,904
From e-commerce inventory strategies
to streaming content, investment from

221
00:16:21,904 --> 00:16:26,944
digital retail conversion optimization to
enterprise market marketplace security.

222
00:16:27,634 --> 00:16:31,444
These systems are reshipping how
industries operate and compete.

223
00:16:31,944 --> 00:16:36,489
Thank you so much for your time and
I hope this showed how recommendation

224
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:41,739
system act as strategic in engines,
not just customer features.

225
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:44,799
And thank they.

226
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,459
Have a great day.

227
00:16:45,669 --> 00:16:46,509
Thank you so much.
