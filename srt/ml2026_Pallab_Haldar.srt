1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,520
Speaker 18: Hello everybody.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,100
My name is Paulo Hallar.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,559
I play role as a technical architect
in Cognizant Technology Solution.

4
00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:14,559
Today I'm going to discuss about a topic
of transforming inventory forecasting

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,459
with Russian machine language.

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,470
So this is the topic.

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:26,020
So this is all about the predicted
demand, automatized actions.

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,090
So it is all about the data, machine
learning language and vision.

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,409
This topic complies of.

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:39,269
So how we'll transform the inventory
forecasting with based of the applying

11
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:44,310
machine learning language to predictive
model, supply model, and optimize the

12
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,620
process, transform the inventory process.

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,150
This is all level.

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,730
I'm going to discuss the next slides.

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,480
One by you one.

16
00:00:52,194 --> 00:00:56,304
So there are three component,
like basic component, that machine

17
00:00:56,304 --> 00:01:01,405
learning, the data itself on which the
machine learning is going to apply.

18
00:01:01,914 --> 00:01:06,384
And based on the apply, the
output is the decision which

19
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:08,815
leads to the automated execution.

20
00:01:09,315 --> 00:01:11,145
Now I'm going to the next slide.

21
00:01:11,645 --> 00:01:15,905
So in today's story, what we'll tell
why inventory forecasting fails.

22
00:01:16,505 --> 00:01:20,795
Inventory forecasting mean it is
declared for all organization, all

23
00:01:20,845 --> 00:01:25,975
organization and all big companies
where they need to keep inventory in

24
00:01:25,975 --> 00:01:28,464
different warehouse for different purpose.

25
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:29,785
They use that inventory.

26
00:01:29,785 --> 00:01:33,324
Like for the tering, they use
the inventory in the kitchen

27
00:01:33,684 --> 00:01:35,184
for nail polish upon system.

28
00:01:35,184 --> 00:01:39,234
They use the chemicals store
in the as a inventory in the.

29
00:01:39,544 --> 00:01:43,984
Warehouse and then use E to make that
particular nail polish kind of thing

30
00:01:43,984 --> 00:01:45,454
and different kind of contrasting.

31
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,674
So these all things is needed.

32
00:01:48,034 --> 00:01:52,654
So inventory forecasting plays a
major role in different industry.

33
00:01:53,374 --> 00:01:58,424
So what today I'm going to
discuss and utilize, so how we can

34
00:01:58,424 --> 00:02:01,844
optimize the inventory forecasting
using machine learning language.

35
00:02:02,344 --> 00:02:06,675
So the second second point I'm going to
discuss about the reference architecture,

36
00:02:07,155 --> 00:02:13,245
how data-driven ion has been taken by
using machine learning language, then

37
00:02:13,245 --> 00:02:18,225
the production machine learning life
cycle, the business impact and key

38
00:02:18,225 --> 00:02:22,100
takeaway from the optimization process.

39
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,220
Okay, in today's date, inventory
planning phase, a volatile environment

40
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,710
of the demand sensitivity, there are.

41
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,435
Different kind of barrier in the supply
chain process, which may cause a supply

42
00:02:34,435 --> 00:02:37,230
chain process, destruction and disruption.

43
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:42,030
As a result, the manual spread driven
process we have to apply, and this

44
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,430
also lead to the delay, the decision
leading to stockout and excess

45
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,140
inventory and operational list.

46
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:56,090
This volatile demand and supply disruption
manual planning delays and different

47
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,860
kind of lack of, so this is happening
due to lack of predictive intelligence,

48
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,870
no foresight to adjust the changes this
gap we are trying to implement here.

49
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,800
So in this topic, we'll discuss
about the, how we can implement

50
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,190
the predictive intelligence to
optimize the inventory planning.

51
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,030
The next one is why forecasting fails.

52
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:20,770
As I told, different kind of
barriers, different kind of errors

53
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:25,120
and different kind of approval
process, different kind of rules

54
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,700
regulation, different kind of audit.

55
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,230
There are thousands number of
reason why the forecast got failed.

56
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,500
For an example, like
there is statics rules.

57
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,520
There is.

58
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,500
OID data.

59
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,700
There is no feedback loop.

60
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,350
There is lots of this.

61
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:48,700
I only mentioned three, as I told, there
is thousands of barrier and thousands of

62
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,930
blockage, which cause the forecast fail.

63
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:59,880
So using the machine learning intelligence
and intelligence decision, we are going

64
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:06,150
to try to overcome those barriers to
make the forecast accurate and perfect,

65
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,760
and optimize the inventory process.

66
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:15,860
In the next slide, I am trying to describe
the target architecture, how we'll build

67
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:21,230
the target architecture of the system, how
it'll mitigate the traditional inventory

68
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:27,800
management to make it more effective and
time less time consuming, and it became

69
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:33,610
the optimized in nature of, in terms of
cost, in terms of labor, in terms of.

70
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,080
Automation in terms of every
time it'll get optimized.

71
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,370
So there are, this is that basic
architecture of the system, like

72
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,880
data feature model, and decisions.

73
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,719
So the data came from the unified
data pipeline will harmonize the

74
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:55,849
data and make the result data
source as a unified data pipelines.

75
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:56,300
Then the.

76
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,060
It comes as a signal.

77
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,380
High value predictive signals in the
model Azure native VML model apply.

78
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:09,070
On top of that, then we are taking
the automated action flow based on the

79
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,550
result we get by applying the machine
learning language, machine learning

80
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:19,610
algorithm to those model on top of
the data, and then take, generate

81
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,985
the vision based on the output.

82
00:05:21,485 --> 00:05:24,935
The next slide, I provided the
data ingestion layer, how the

83
00:05:24,935 --> 00:05:26,825
data ingestion layer occurred.

84
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:30,270
If you see in that different kind of
normalization, harmonization data is

85
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:35,110
there, ERP, po os IOT, these are the
data sources which ingest the data.

86
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,470
Data in inventory process.

87
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,670
The inventory process in the oil house,
there is different kind of warehouse.

88
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,260
There is inbound.

89
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,840
Warehouse, there might
be outbound warehouse.

90
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,850
There are different kind of warehouse.

91
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,580
So in those warehouse, all
the data has been collected

92
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,620
from different kind of system.

93
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,950
All those warehouse do not
have the same kind of system.

94
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:01,560
Like one warehouse might have ERP system,
another warehouse might have IOT system.

95
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,730
So the data lake that all the
data come ingest inside there

96
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,735
and come to the data lake.

97
00:06:07,235 --> 00:06:11,974
Which build on top of the Azure platform,
Azure Data Factory Pipeline comes

98
00:06:11,974 --> 00:06:14,705
all the data, lake Gen two storage.

99
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:17,150
We store all the data, harmonize the data.

100
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:22,269
If you see the data quality and
government, this is all the data quality,

101
00:06:22,269 --> 00:06:23,919
which is the data cleansing process.

102
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,739
Like you clean, you verifying the
email id, you are cleaning the address

103
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:34,299
space, you are cleaning, the other
catalog objects, this kind of thing.

104
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:38,709
Validation data, quality validation,
data cleansing, taking process.

105
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:39,759
Also data.

106
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,849
Governments also take process
live by schema validation.

107
00:06:43,429 --> 00:06:48,049
Linear edge and catalog, which I was
telling earlier, and then provide the

108
00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:53,449
secured access control to the secure
person, to the specified person who having

109
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:55,335
assigned the role to access the data.

110
00:06:55,835 --> 00:06:58,984
The next one is the feature
engineering, which sessionize

111
00:06:58,984 --> 00:07:01,744
the signal and optimize the disc.

112
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,680
Optimize the disk for, given the failure
and the inventory management short and

113
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,765
lack of data, lack of inventory to the
warehouse, it reduce the risk of that.

114
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:19,900
Also, it reduce the, maximum overall
capacity and overall what targeted,

115
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,785
which material has been ordered overly
that it also reduce the risk for that.

116
00:07:25,685 --> 00:07:26,975
So this is all about.

117
00:07:27,385 --> 00:07:32,965
That particular description of that
particular feature engineering,

118
00:07:32,965 --> 00:07:35,185
which a major part of the.

119
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,470
Processes.

120
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,160
So in this slide I described all
the detailed feature of the feature

121
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,880
engineering, which defines to lack
feature, define sessional signal.

122
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,740
So these kind of things.

123
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,125
This is, I'm providing an example,
so like lack feature session signal.

124
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,885
Then in this feature will provide
promotion and weather signal.

125
00:07:53,275 --> 00:07:55,630
This is a kind of example I provided her.

126
00:07:56,005 --> 00:07:58,445
So this incorporated promotion
and the kind of thing.

127
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:00,695
And then we are getting
the accurate result.

128
00:08:00,785 --> 00:08:02,285
My mission is to.

129
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:07,435
Provide all the detail by using an
example how what is feature engineering

130
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:10,765
and why we will use feature engineering.

131
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:15,995
In the next slide, I tried to describe the
model validation, complies of different

132
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:22,025
kind of steps along which, which is a
back testing, evaluate accuracy, metrics,

133
00:08:22,505 --> 00:08:24,245
everybody using different kind of.

134
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:29,675
Procedure, like M-A-E-M-A-C
mean standard evaluation.

135
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:36,025
Then M-A-M-A-P-E, these are the different
kind of statistic method that used to

136
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:38,545
evaluate accurate metrics for that.

137
00:08:39,045 --> 00:08:42,165
Back testing and different
kind of other testing.

138
00:08:42,165 --> 00:08:45,015
Also identify bias and fairness.

139
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:49,305
There is different kind of, as I
tell, told blockage, different kind

140
00:08:49,305 --> 00:08:51,765
of restriction, different kind of.

141
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:58,025
Approval process and other rules that
block those inventory then disturb the

142
00:08:58,025 --> 00:09:02,315
supply chain process to get that inventory
into the warehouse in proper time.

143
00:09:02,705 --> 00:09:05,990
So each identify all the basis biases and.

144
00:09:06,465 --> 00:09:11,355
Try to identify and collect those
information to push to the next step.

145
00:09:11,415 --> 00:09:16,665
Okay, so it has different kind of
object like ED, a, fairness indicator.

146
00:09:16,695 --> 00:09:20,115
These are the different kind of
metrics, vising techniques, all

147
00:09:20,115 --> 00:09:21,285
the other metrics are there.

148
00:09:22,185 --> 00:09:26,325
So that use to collect the barriers
and try to push into the next

149
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:28,995
layer so that we can identify that.

150
00:09:29,075 --> 00:09:33,775
Outliner and remove them, and then
we are try to address those bias

151
00:09:33,895 --> 00:09:39,150
and all those, stoppage, blockage to
avoid the supply chain disruption.

152
00:09:39,985 --> 00:09:44,425
I'm going to the next slide, which is
talking about the deployment and the

153
00:09:44,425 --> 00:09:49,320
email ops, which is the CI CD four
ml of ops using the machine learning.

154
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,940
That is track and managing models,
register and version ML models.

155
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,995
These are the deployment of the.

156
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,250
Processes, which involve in the machine
learning implementation for them,

157
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,430
inventory management optimization.

158
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:08,650
After applying the machine learning
algorithm, like linear regression to a

159
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:13,170
particular model, to a, based on the input
data, then what we need to do, we need

160
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,260
to maintain the metadata for auditing.

161
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,060
Register the Han email for deployment.

162
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,910
Then manual model for the deployment.

163
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,910
Then monitor performance
sales, these all the things.

164
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,465
Talking about model registry and
monitoring alerts, talking about that.

165
00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:31,285
Deployment process, a deployment
in the email of now the prediction

166
00:10:31,525 --> 00:10:33,595
to on how we are predicting this.

167
00:10:34,075 --> 00:10:38,995
This comes in picture when we
harmonize the data, normalize the

168
00:10:38,995 --> 00:10:41,815
data, and apply machine learning
agreement to algorithm dam.

169
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,525
This is a learning phase.

170
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:45,145
This is a model generation phase.

171
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,305
This is a deployment development app.

172
00:10:47,305 --> 00:10:51,780
Once the model is trained properly, then
we'll do the model registry and each.

173
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,630
Passes to the actual data.

174
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,710
So we are maintaining the
data, using the historical data

175
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,400
with that supervised learning.

176
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,290
Then after either model is automated
and tuned properly, then actually

177
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:10,480
it is provided as out input to that
particular model after deployment

178
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,580
and module registry, and then it'll
generate automatic data, output

179
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:20,845
data and related data from the model
application after deployment to get there.

180
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:23,535
Proper inventory, what need to be ordered?

181
00:11:23,535 --> 00:11:24,795
Suppose do we need 30?

182
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,705
So the predict tool define that.

183
00:11:27,705 --> 00:11:29,385
Okay, we need 28 or 29.

184
00:11:29,805 --> 00:11:32,295
This is very close to the expected order.

185
00:11:32,295 --> 00:11:35,290
It'll never order 10,
which might lead to a less.

186
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:41,580
Inventories that might disrupt the
business process or some of hel

187
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,130
inventory like 70 that also waste
of the inventory that will log.

188
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:52,910
So that way it'll, it supposed to order
very close to the target, like 30, 20, 29.

189
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,080
So that's how actually after
training, it'll not the actual data.

190
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,235
So that's how after taking the data,
it'll order the inventory from the

191
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,110
third party vendor or the suppliers.

192
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,670
That is how the inventory process occurs.

193
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,550
That is the business impact for that.

194
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,770
If you order proper amount of
inventory and kept in the warehouse,

195
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:17,180
it'll reduce stockouts, lower
inventory costs, faster division.

196
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:22,600
It'll improve efficiency and it'll
continue help to continue the business

197
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,880
process, which subsequently led to.

198
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,035
The revenue, need revenue of the
company, of the organization like this.

199
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,120
I provide a healthcare scenario.

200
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,250
Yeah, for an example where demand
forecasting for supplier capacity

201
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:40,440
planning, they do capacity planning
and proactive replenishment, so do

202
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,890
that, how they improve cap efficiency.

203
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,580
And then in the capacity planning,
if you see there are sub steps where

204
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,830
they used to implement, prepare
for the high demand, then allocate

205
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,800
resource efficiently, then find the
proactive replenishment what they do.

206
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,710
They maintain the educate
inventory and reduce this shortage.

207
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,940
These all the steps, they applied.

208
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,010
The one way there, the data layer.

209
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,580
After the data layer, harmonization
of the data prepar preparation

210
00:13:04,955 --> 00:13:07,505
layer, they applied to the next step.

211
00:13:07,505 --> 00:13:13,355
The data where the applied, the email
algorithms applied to get the actual.

212
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:18,175
Output by learning those model
one by one to get accuracy.

213
00:13:18,325 --> 00:13:23,425
And finally, the model is registered to a
deployment environment where it connect to

214
00:13:23,425 --> 00:13:29,325
the application and produced proper output
supply chain scenario where again, I am

215
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:34,005
promoting another scenario where logistic
optimization done disruption prediction,

216
00:13:34,035 --> 00:13:35,655
risk cover planning has been done.

217
00:13:36,135 --> 00:13:38,595
The main, basic objective.

218
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,450
Is to show you how different
kind of optimization applied in

219
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,800
different business case and different
industry and different domain.

220
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,720
Here in the logistic optimization,
they adapt this adapt routine advance.

221
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,760
This is a kind of business scenario.

222
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,420
So in the sub scenario, they
applied some machine learning

223
00:13:57,465 --> 00:13:59,700
and algorithm and generate some.

224
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,370
Data by after deploying those models
and this data flows to the next

225
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,900
table, like optimized shipping costs.

226
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:10,010
These are one, substep is
dependent on another, and it'll

227
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,560
lead to different optimization.

228
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,060
Subsequently sought purchases.

229
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:19,270
Finally list to a total optimized
way, material optimization,

230
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,465
to say target optimization.

231
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:21,955
Leading to resilience.

232
00:14:21,955 --> 00:14:26,335
If you see in that risk cover
plan, this is another main process

233
00:14:26,335 --> 00:14:30,685
where the optimization has been
acquired using machine learning.

234
00:14:30,685 --> 00:14:34,435
AP applied in that model for
the inventory optimization.

235
00:14:34,935 --> 00:14:39,915
That what we can say in here like
this kind of optimization, using

236
00:14:39,915 --> 00:14:45,095
machine learning and supervising,
we can minimize the risk of, waste

237
00:14:45,605 --> 00:14:49,805
of the inventory as well as we can
also ensure that our business will

238
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,830
learn in proper way and proper time.

239
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,705
It'll not stop.

240
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,660
Due to the lack of the inventory
in our system, it'll also

241
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,250
optimize the supply chain process.

242
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:04,380
It'll remove all the disruption from
the main processes, subprocesses and

243
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,390
different kind of approval processes rule.

244
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:11,100
It'll take care of the rule automatically
where manual intervention is not required.

245
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,000
That's how you can be very sure that,
okay, your business is running very

246
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,550
successfully using this optimization
where it'll finally lead to the

247
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,710
revenue for the organization.

248
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:29,230
So this is all about my pre topic over
here, inventory management optimization

249
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,570
using machine learning language.

250
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:32,800
Thank you.

251
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:33,250
I.
