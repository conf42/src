1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:00,679
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:01,969
Hi everyone.

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,560
This is Han Pu from University
of Central Missouri.

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,530
Today I'll talk about building
regulatory compliance systems by

5
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,340
design not as an afterthought.

6
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:18,310
We will explore how architectural patterns
like event sourcing by temporal data graph

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:24,600
lineage CQRS, APAC and adaptive learning
can turn compliance into an enabler and

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,420
instead of a burden let's go to our.

9
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:33,735
Topic the regulatory pressure landscape
the regulatory pressure landscape is

10
00:00:33,735 --> 00:00:40,225
evolving rapidly global institutions
face risking complexity in areas like

11
00:00:40,255 --> 00:00:44,155
a ML data, privacy and risk management.

12
00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:48,975
Traditional compliance methods often
come in late creating bottleneck

13
00:00:48,975 --> 00:00:50,745
and always with penalties.

14
00:00:51,145 --> 00:00:51,570
We will look.

15
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,640
At why this reactive
mindset is unsustainable.

16
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:56,540
Okay.

17
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,620
So if you look at the numbers say each
all escalating market growth in rec tech,

18
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,640
billions of dollars in penalties and
huge manual overload, the cost of doing

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,760
compliance is reactively massive instead
of patching systems after every new rule.

20
00:01:15,455 --> 00:01:19,865
We need to architect them to
participate, to anticipate

21
00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:22,665
regulation from like day one.

22
00:01:23,655 --> 00:01:25,005
So for that.

23
00:01:25,465 --> 00:01:28,825
The compliance by design
is what we introduced.

24
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:34,265
So as the name sets it all it
flips the mindset rather than

25
00:01:34,265 --> 00:01:36,515
vaulting on controls later over.

26
00:01:36,855 --> 00:01:41,855
Compliance is basically it's like a
design, structural design principle.

27
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:47,135
When compliance is built into
our architecture, like security

28
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:54,115
scalability, performance, reduce risk,
improve agility, and regular trust.

29
00:01:54,505 --> 00:01:55,465
In simple words.

30
00:01:55,525 --> 00:01:58,715
It's not a checklist anymore
it's a design strategy.

31
00:01:59,255 --> 00:02:02,555
Coming to the next one let's
see, what are the patterns?

32
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:08,065
So these are the three fun,
foundational and fundamental patterns.

33
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:12,694
One is even sourcing by temporal
data and graph metadata.

34
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:19,239
So even sourcing is this is for like
immutable audit trails bitemporal data.

35
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:24,809
This is for like time accuracy and
graph metadata is for traceability.

36
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,509
Together all these three fundamental
patterns they make the systems

37
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:34,684
naturally compliant, transparent,
consistent, and audible.

38
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:38,529
Next event let's look
into this like one by one.

39
00:02:38,899 --> 00:02:40,459
One is event sourcing.

40
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:47,609
Event sourcing means every change is
captured as an event never over return.

41
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:52,019
It's like keeping a diary instead
of editing yesterday's entry.

42
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:56,379
Technically it's an append
only lock with playable history

43
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:58,629
and cryptographic integrity.

44
00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:04,379
For regulators, that means this
is like full traceability and non

45
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:08,704
reputation, so the data is ever lost or.

46
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:10,344
Ever hidden.

47
00:03:10,704 --> 00:03:12,054
There is no concept of that.

48
00:03:12,144 --> 00:03:15,384
So in this case, no data is lost at all.

49
00:03:15,984 --> 00:03:19,014
So let's go to the Bitemporal data models.

50
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:22,524
Bitemporal modeling tracks two timelines.

51
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:25,054
One is transaction timeline.

52
00:03:25,364 --> 00:03:26,834
The other one is valid time.

53
00:03:27,254 --> 00:03:29,384
So what is transaction time?

54
00:03:29,764 --> 00:03:31,354
So transaction time is nothing.

55
00:03:31,354 --> 00:03:35,354
But when it happened in real
life what is valid time?

56
00:03:35,684 --> 00:03:37,244
Valid time is nothing.

57
00:03:37,244 --> 00:03:42,194
But when the system learned about it,
this dual view allows reconstruction of.

58
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:46,829
Reality at any point,
even after corrections.

59
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:51,609
It's vital for audit accuracy
and regulatory trust.

60
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:56,509
Let's go to our third pattern,
which is graph based lineage.

61
00:03:56,559 --> 00:04:02,799
Compliance depends on knowing where
data came from and how it changed.

62
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:08,219
Graph based lineage uses notes
and edges to map data flow

63
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:10,229
across microservices and systems.

64
00:04:10,529 --> 00:04:15,149
You can visually trace a report
number all the way to its data source.

65
00:04:15,619 --> 00:04:23,139
This ensures transparency for auditors
and easy impact analysis for engineers.

66
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,309
Next is CQRS.

67
00:04:25,369 --> 00:04:29,639
CQRS is command query
Responsibility Segregation.

68
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:35,624
So this one separates right and
read parts, the common side.

69
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:42,684
Validates transactions enforces compliance
rules while the query site is optimized

70
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:45,604
for audits monitoring and reporting.

71
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:50,754
So this separation improves
scalability performance.

72
00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:54,944
It is reg it is basically ideal
for regulatory systems that

73
00:04:54,944 --> 00:04:57,164
need both accuracy and speed.

74
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:04,859
A c. So a is attribute based access
control goes beyond u user roles.

75
00:05:05,219 --> 00:05:11,059
It considers user attributes, data
sensitivity, and context in real time.

76
00:05:11,429 --> 00:05:17,309
For example, an analyst in Europe
can access Europe data under GDPR.

77
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,589
While a contractor see MA data AB
AAC policies are declarative and

78
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:28,999
fully auditable making compliance
dynamic and policy driving.

79
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:29,689
Yes.

80
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:30,369
Yep.

81
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,739
Next adaptive, exceptional handling
and reinforce hand learning.

82
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:42,099
So compliance exceptions happen, but
what if systems could learn from them?

83
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:47,654
So this approach, this using
reinforcement learning, we can detect

84
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:53,104
exceptions pick optimal responses
execute and improve over the time.

85
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:59,854
The system evolves reducing recurring
complex issues and adopting to

86
00:05:59,854 --> 00:06:02,314
new regulations intelligently.

87
00:06:02,684 --> 00:06:05,344
That is what adaptive Exception says.

88
00:06:05,764 --> 00:06:09,694
Coming to the next one, we
talk about the architecture.

89
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:15,904
So here is a view of implementation
of effort across all the components,

90
00:06:15,904 --> 00:06:17,374
which we discussed so far.

91
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:23,464
So even sourcing and CQRS requires
significant work while AAC and

92
00:06:23,474 --> 00:06:26,144
bitemporal models are lighter lifts.

93
00:06:26,624 --> 00:06:27,644
This helps.

94
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:32,784
To prioritize a phased adoption,
like start small, prove

95
00:06:32,784 --> 00:06:34,854
the value scale gradually.

96
00:06:35,454 --> 00:06:38,574
Next, let's talk about the
business value proposition.

97
00:06:38,994 --> 00:06:41,814
So the payoff is substantial.

98
00:06:42,489 --> 00:06:47,799
From reactive compliance to proactive
assurance, from manual overhead to

99
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:52,979
automated reporting from risk management
to competitive differentiation.

100
00:06:53,399 --> 00:07:00,059
So embedding compliance, boost
efficiency, trust and agility.

101
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,759
Next let's talk about its implementation.

102
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:06,849
This is a roadmap, a practical roadmap.

103
00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:13,259
First one is you assess all the gaps,
map and map all the current obligations.

104
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:17,889
Second one is design phase, where
design around the core patterns.

105
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:20,599
Third one is pilot implementation.

106
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:25,919
You, we basically just pilot one
domain to validate the results.

107
00:07:26,444 --> 00:07:27,764
Scale and optimize.

108
00:07:28,084 --> 00:07:33,934
So this is like wide and optimize
this approach reduces risk while

109
00:07:33,934 --> 00:07:36,034
building the internal capability.

110
00:07:36,534 --> 00:07:38,124
So what are the key takeaways?

111
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,684
Let's discuss.

112
00:07:39,784 --> 00:07:41,134
So to summarize.

113
00:07:41,554 --> 00:07:43,324
Compliance is not a burden.

114
00:07:43,414 --> 00:07:44,914
It's a structural principle.

115
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:50,464
Architectural patterns like
event sourcing bipolar bitemporal

116
00:07:50,494 --> 00:07:53,704
models, graph lineage, CQRS.

117
00:07:53,734 --> 00:07:58,454
Apac adoptive RL makes
compliance seamless.

118
00:07:58,704 --> 00:08:01,464
By designing with regulation in mind.

119
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:06,444
We turn complex into co into
a competitive advantage.

120
00:08:07,094 --> 00:08:07,364
Yeah.

121
00:08:07,585 --> 00:08:09,344
Thank you for joining me.

122
00:08:09,734 --> 00:08:13,724
I hope this gave you some practical
insights on building systems

123
00:08:13,724 --> 00:08:18,135
that are compliant by design,
but not by ch but not by chance.

124
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:22,895
Feel free to connect on LinkedIn or
please reach out after this session.

125
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,335
I would love to continue the discussion.

126
00:08:25,425 --> 00:08:25,845
Thank you.
