00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:01,920
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,870
Thank you for joining this session.

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,430
Today we are going to look at a challenge
that every contact center faces how to

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,230
stay resilient when incidents strike,
whether it's a sudden system outage, a

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,770
spike in call volume, or an unexpected
service disruption, these moments can

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,165
quickly spiral and damage customer trust.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,350
Over the next few minutes, I'll
share how AI automation and modern

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,060
architectures can help us prepare
for those high pressure situations

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,610
and turn them into opportunities to
deliver consistent, reliable support.

10
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,370
My name is Ji Ku.

11
00:00:41,025 --> 00:00:42,015
And I'm with Copart.

12
00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:46,335
I'll walk you through how we can
design customer support architectures

13
00:00:46,575 --> 00:00:51,315
that remain strong during pressure,
and how intelligent automation

14
00:00:51,315 --> 00:00:55,725
and AI power decision making can
help us maintain excellence even

15
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,855
when critical incidents occur.

16
00:00:58,355 --> 00:01:02,495
In the world of contact centers,
every single second matters

17
00:01:03,124 --> 00:01:04,144
when a system goes down.

18
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:10,475
Or when demand suddenly surges, the
disruption doesn't stay in one place.

19
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:14,584
It cascades through the
entire customer experience.

20
00:01:15,035 --> 00:01:20,975
For example, if a CRM system is
unavailable, agents can't access

21
00:01:20,975 --> 00:01:23,434
order history or customer details.

22
00:01:23,854 --> 00:01:30,214
That leads to repeated questions longer
hold times, and more dropped calls.

23
00:01:30,994 --> 00:01:34,684
From the customer's perspective,
this feels like a lack of

24
00:01:34,684 --> 00:01:39,574
empathy, a lack of care, and it
often spills onto social media.

25
00:01:40,204 --> 00:01:44,014
The end result is damage,
trust and higher churn.

26
00:01:44,514 --> 00:01:49,654
The message is clear, incidents are
inevitable, but how we response determines

27
00:01:49,654 --> 00:01:52,294
whether customers stay with us or leave.

28
00:01:52,794 --> 00:01:56,634
To handle this challenge, the
foundation has to be cloud native.

29
00:01:57,279 --> 00:01:58,419
Support architecture.

30
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:04,210
This begins with microservices, which
isolate falls so that one failure

31
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,339
doesn't bring the whole system down.

32
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:11,909
It also means using even driven
processing, which enables real time

33
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:14,430
responsiveness to unexpected changes.

34
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:20,635
And finally, auto-scaling infrastructure
ensures that when traffic spikes, the

35
00:02:20,635 --> 00:02:25,405
system can adjust resources dynamically
without sacrificing performance.

36
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:31,329
This foundation is about resilience
by design, not resilience by chance.

37
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:36,540
On top of this foundation, we
bring in ai, one of the first areas

38
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,999
in AI powered intent detection.

39
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:44,790
This technology uses natural language
processing and historical data to

40
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,809
understand what a customer is asking
from the very first interaction.

41
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:52,099
During incidents, accurate
routing is essential.

42
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:58,279
If calls are being misdirected or
misclassified, it only adds friction.

43
00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:04,189
AI ensures that resources are
allocated efficiently, even

44
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:05,454
when the systems are under

45
00:03:05,954 --> 00:03:09,075
multi intent and emotional intelligence.

46
00:03:09,164 --> 00:03:12,015
Of course, customer
conversations are layer simple.

47
00:03:13,005 --> 00:03:17,385
Many times a customer has more than
one intent in the same interaction.

48
00:03:18,195 --> 00:03:23,355
Modern AI can detect both
primary and secondary objectives,

49
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:27,015
while also recognizing the
emotional state of the customer.

50
00:03:27,945 --> 00:03:34,214
For instance, if someone says, I can't
log in and I'm really frustrated, the

51
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,524
system doesn't recognize a login issue.

52
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:40,635
It also recognizes the urgency
and the need for empathy.

53
00:03:41,595 --> 00:03:45,465
This allows us to prioritize the
interaction correctly and provide

54
00:03:45,465 --> 00:03:47,655
the right support in the right way.

55
00:03:48,155 --> 00:03:53,465
Another major pillar in autonomous
issue resolution is conversational ai.

56
00:03:53,915 --> 00:03:58,870
Conversational AI handles routine
inquiries such as account updates,

57
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,670
password resets, or basic troubleshooting.

58
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:07,270
By taking care of these requests
automatically, we create reserve capacity

59
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:12,430
for human agents who are then free to
handle more complex and emotionally

60
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,029
charged issues during an incident.

61
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:21,880
This reserve capacity can make the
difference between chaos and control.

62
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,050
Not all issues are equal in risk.

63
00:04:25,544 --> 00:04:30,374
AI helps by applying a
risk-based escalation framework.

64
00:04:31,184 --> 00:04:36,585
Algorithms, analyze patterns, account
histories and behaviors to flag

65
00:04:36,585 --> 00:04:39,854
potential fraud or security concerns.

66
00:04:40,455 --> 00:04:44,234
Each case is scored and the
score determines priority.

67
00:04:45,104 --> 00:04:48,075
High risk situations are
escalated immediately.

68
00:04:48,674 --> 00:04:51,885
While routine matters can
follow the standard workflow.

69
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,670
This dynamic prioritization
ensures that tedious threats

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,890
are never lost in the shuffle.

71
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,650
Another way AI helps is through
AI driven decision trees.

72
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,930
Unlike static flowcharts,
these trees adapt in real time.

73
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,789
They learn from the past resolutions
and adjust path automatically.

74
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:18,789
For example, if one system is degraded
during an incident, the decision

75
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:23,140
tree can automatically reroute
customers to an alternative solution.

76
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,789
This flexibility makes the
entire resolution process more

77
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:30,610
resilient and far more efficient.

78
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,000
Of course, some cases still require
a human agent, but a handoff

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,930
should never mean starting over.

80
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,740
Dynamic handoff systems ensure that
customer's context travels with them.

81
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,830
This includes the interaction,
history, intent, and emotional state.

82
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,800
The agent receives a briefing so they
can pick up immediately without asking

83
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,840
the customer to repeat everything.

84
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,870
This continuity becomes critical
during outages where patients

85
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,909
is already stretched thin.

86
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:05,389
AI doesn't just serve customers.

87
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:10,009
It also augments agents
with real time assistance.

88
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:15,439
Agents can see suggested responses,
compliance guidance, and relevant

89
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,809
knowledge articles right in front of them.

90
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:22,179
AI monitoring ensures that
regulatory requirements are

91
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,999
consistently met even under stress.

92
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:29,969
Speech analytics can even flag
potential compliance violations

93
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:35,699
in real time, allowing corrections
before they become costly mistakes.

94
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,199
Now, the best incident is
the one that never happens.

95
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:42,499
Predictive analytics provides
an early warning system.

96
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:47,089
Machine learning models analyze
historical patterns, system

97
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:52,099
metrics, and even external factors
to anticipate potential problems.

98
00:06:52,894 --> 00:06:56,914
For example, if there's a certain
increase in support tickets for password

99
00:06:56,914 --> 00:07:02,344
resets, the system can flag it as
an early sign of a broader outage.

100
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:09,034
This allows proactive communication with
customers, often solving issues even

101
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:11,014
before they ever become full incidents.

102
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:15,019
Customer support is no longer
limited to voice or text.

103
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:18,949
Multimodal AI enables
support through voice.

104
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,039
Text, images, and even video.

105
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,709
A customer can share a photo of an error
message or a video of a malfunction,

106
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:30,979
and AI can interpret it immediately.

107
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:36,349
This dramatically reduces resolution
time and during incidents.

108
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:40,009
Clarity and speed are exactly
what customers expect.

109
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:42,219
Technology resilience is critical.

110
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:45,489
We achieve this through a few mechanisms.

111
00:07:45,954 --> 00:07:46,964
Circuit breakers.

112
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:51,069
Isolate degraded components
so failures don't cascade.

113
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:53,909
Intelligent load distribution balances.

114
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:59,989
Workloads across available resources in
real time and redundant systems ensure

115
00:07:59,989 --> 00:08:04,699
that even if a primary system goes
down, there are still alternative parts

116
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:07,339
available to keep operations running.

117
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,039
To bring all this together, we use a
four phase implementation approach.

118
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:12,999
Phase one.

119
00:08:13,044 --> 00:08:16,134
It is establishing a
cloud native foundation.

120
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:21,474
Phase two is integrating AI for
intent recognition and routing.

121
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:26,724
Phase three is enhancing automation
with predictive analytics

122
00:08:26,754 --> 00:08:28,344
and multimodal processing.

123
00:08:28,844 --> 00:08:35,024
Phase four is resilience optimization,
fine tuning, load balancing, failover, and

124
00:08:35,024 --> 00:08:37,244
incident response procedures All together.

125
00:08:37,744 --> 00:08:41,254
Think of this as a roadmap
rather than a one-time project.

126
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:46,675
The future of incident ready contact
centers is about convergence.

127
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:52,194
When intelligent automation, predictive
analytics, and human expertise come

128
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:55,525
together, we achieve resilience at scale.

129
00:08:56,425 --> 00:08:59,665
It's not about eliminating
incidents that's impossible.

130
00:09:00,234 --> 00:09:04,135
It's about being ready so that when
an incident happens, the customer

131
00:09:04,135 --> 00:09:06,234
still experience excellence.

132
00:09:06,734 --> 00:09:09,435
Thank you all for taking the
time to join this session.

133
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:15,314
I hope you've taken away some clear
ideas about how AI and automation

134
00:09:15,314 --> 00:09:18,884
can transform the resilience of
your customer support operations.

135
00:09:19,484 --> 00:09:24,404
By building incident ready systems
today, we can ensure that customer

136
00:09:24,404 --> 00:09:25,754
trust is preserved tomorrow.

137
00:09:26,474 --> 00:09:27,974
Thank you and have a good day.
