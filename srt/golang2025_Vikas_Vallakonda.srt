00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,670
Hi,  this is Ika.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,700
I'm myself, a season profession with,  14
years of experience in analysis, design,

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:14,729
configuration development,  and deployment
of ERP business applications,  which is

4
00:00:14,729 --> 00:00:18,810
mainly focused in revenue management, a
subscription order management, conversion

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,249
charging and conversion invoicing.

6
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:23,039
I have been working,  in different areas.

7
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,599
And different industries,  such as
banking, utilities, manufacturing,

8
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:28,729
finance, and insurance areas.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,230
And currently I'm working as a,  technical
program manager role with,  and I'm

10
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:41,210
super excited,  to share my overall
experience and how,  and,  and how

11
00:00:41,839 --> 00:00:45,029
securing revenue managed systems,  in
an enterprise,  how much important

12
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:47,399
it is and how it's gonna impact.

13
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,079
Different industries.

14
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:53,790
Revenue member systems have become the
backbone of modern enterprise operations.

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,789
And in this presentation,  how enterprise
can navigate,  daling security landscapes

16
00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:05,399
through AI Cloud and a robust,  incident
framework response frameworks.

17
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:09,029
I'm able,  I will be able
to,  give some,  high level.

18
00:01:10,814 --> 00:01:12,054
High level,  points.

19
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:14,734
How an our nation can
address all these things.

20
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:28,994
If you consider the RMS,  secret
threat landscape,  there is a

21
00:01:28,994 --> 00:01:31,904
42.2% surge in targeted breaches.

22
00:01:32,684 --> 00:01:35,764
And, there are a lot of sophist
sophisticated algorithm, exportations

23
00:01:37,144 --> 00:01:40,984
three points, eight, 6 million per
breach impact in every organization.

24
00:01:40,984 --> 00:01:46,234
When there is a breach with the security
threats, there are some advanced

25
00:01:46,504 --> 00:01:50,464
encryption standards and awareness
in every,  location they're using.

26
00:01:52,144 --> 00:01:57,129
And,  AI is one of the main power security
enhancement where you can, analyze,  an

27
00:01:57,129 --> 00:02:03,039
organization security based on the threat
detection, complaints, management, and

28
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,709
how you can,  optimize your revenue
and how can it help you,  update in the

29
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:14,470
market analysis, advance AI and machine
learning technologies for,  revenue and

30
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:19,359
system security simultaneously driving
sustainable business performance gains.

31
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,470
There's one more framework called
multi-layered security framework.

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,540
There are four parts in this
framework,  like continuous monitoring,

33
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,450
access controls, data production,
and infrastructure security.

34
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,440
These four areas are very much important
for an organization to,  secure

35
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,500
their data, multi-layer, and at the
same time,  continuously monitoring

36
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,510
if there are any breaches or.

37
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,360
If there is a vulnerability is
happening in the organization.

38
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,650
And,  there's one more area which I want
to cover is cloud nato, RM Security.

39
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,150
In this area, if you see,  automated
disaster record, which is a very

40
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,200
crucial nowadays because everything
is stored in cloud, if there, there's

41
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,600
a, if there's any disaster, how we can
automatically recover that, recover the

42
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,170
data and the scalable security controls.

43
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:15,160
This is one area where an automation can
impact with automated security governance.

44
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,860
Insur ensuring protection
throughout the automation growth.

45
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,330
One more area they can work,
they can concentrate, is on

46
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,310
secure cloud infrastructure.

47
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,490
Secure cloud infrastructure.

48
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,950
Leading cloud providers develop.

49
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,130
Deliver enterprise grade security
capabilities that consist

50
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,640
outperform in our solutions
across all protection metrics.

51
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,030
And one more area I want to,  cover in
this video is dynamic pricing protection.

52
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,910
How an automation can dynamic, do a
dynamic pricing protection, like using

53
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:53,780
an auth,  using authentication like
multi, multi factor grade authentication

54
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,550
protocols, algorithm integrity.

55
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,210
Where we're sending
controlling anomaly detection.

56
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,340
And one more area I want to cover
is incident response framework,

57
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,650
which is very crucial for nowadays.

58
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,950
There are a lot of breaches happening
across all the organizations.

59
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,820
So how to detect it, how an
incident response framework can

60
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,990
we build in an organization?

61
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,370
Like how you can detect it, what
is the response time, automated

62
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,760
response time, how we can recover
it, like using the backups and.

63
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:27,915
How you can restore it and documentation,
which is very crucial,  in regards to

64
00:04:27,915 --> 00:04:32,325
the complaints and in future, how to
prevent it from future,  incidents.

65
00:04:33,675 --> 00:04:37,755
So overall, if you see, and one
more important area I want to

66
00:04:37,755 --> 00:04:39,045
cover is a compliance management.

67
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,145
Every country has their
own complaints thing.

68
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:46,674
If you take uk, US Middle East,
Asia, Europe, everyone have their

69
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:48,505
own compliance thing like P-C-I-D-S.

70
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:49,554
S-G-D-P-R, Sox.

71
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:54,049
It is,  it's one of the major area
where an organization should link

72
00:04:54,049 --> 00:04:58,459
into it because now it is, everything
is global and it is very much

73
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:03,439
important in,  revenue management
areas, how you can be regulatory,

74
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,609
covering all the complaints forever.

75
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:09,989
How you are preparing your audit,
preparing for your audit, how the data

76
00:05:09,989 --> 00:05:14,789
is, data privacy is,  maintained in an
organization and satisfaction management.

77
00:05:15,299 --> 00:05:17,679
These are very crucial because,
every organization have their

78
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:21,059
third party vendors and,  lot of
internal audit and external audit.

79
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:25,589
So these,  these are very much
important for doing,  day-to-day

80
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:26,819
business across the globe.

81
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:33,559
The key takeaways,  and the action
items from I want to discuss,  in

82
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:39,499
this video is how you can implement
multi-layered security, how you can

83
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:44,299
leverage AI for detection and automation,
establish robot incident response time

84
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,789
transition to secure cloud architects.

85
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:52,279
So overall,  these are the four
areas where I covered in this video.

86
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:57,130
And,  thank you so much for giving
me this opportunity and,  looking

87
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,270
forward for the confidence.

88
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:58,750
Thank you.
