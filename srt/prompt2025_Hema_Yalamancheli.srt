1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,040
Hi, my name is Hema and I work
as a release train engineer

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,480
in Tyler Technologies.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,470
So my role is all around how
Agile works, scrum works.

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,725
So I am even like agile coach,
so I know in the real world how

5
00:00:14,725 --> 00:00:19,494
Agile works and what problems we
face, what team problems will be.

6
00:00:19,544 --> 00:00:22,694
I felt like AI can be useful in this area.

7
00:00:22,884 --> 00:00:28,224
That's where I'm here with AI as your
agile, copilot, predictability, risk

8
00:00:28,224 --> 00:00:32,215
aware, and human-centric delivery
in the age of prompt engineering.

9
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:36,175
So what are the problems
that right now Agile has?

10
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:41,144
Has like challenges, the
real, the reality gap.

11
00:00:41,384 --> 00:00:46,574
Enterprise agile teams frequently
encount significant gaps between

12
00:00:46,874 --> 00:00:51,584
strategic plan and actual delivery
outcomes leading to missed

13
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:53,894
deadlines and resource misalignment.

14
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,919
And the common pain points are sprint
overruns and missed commitments,

15
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:04,169
inaccurate effort estimate,
hidden dependencies, surface late.

16
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,000
Resource allocation will be insufficient.

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,779
AI beyond task automation, it can be
a strategic CoLab pilot, intelligent

18
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:17,639
planning and proactive risk detection,
how a strategic co-pilot works.

19
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:25,079
AI transforms from simple automation
to intelligent partnership, augmented

20
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,689
human development decision making
across the delivery life cycles.

21
00:01:31,199 --> 00:01:33,719
Intelligent planning, so how this works.

22
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,029
Machine learning models analyze
historic patterns to enhance

23
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,429
backlog, refinement, and capacity
forecasting, proactive risk detection.

24
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:46,969
So how can AI help in this area?

25
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:51,710
Real time monitoring identifies
collaboration issues and burn

26
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:57,380
down signals and delivers blockers
before they get escalated.

27
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,410
So there are some AI driven capacity
models like skill alignment analysis,

28
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:08,380
seasonal productive patterns, historic
velocity data, productive success

29
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,779
rates, so we can better use them.

30
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:17,839
So it, it also helps in enhancing
sprint success, how the opportunities by

31
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:23,629
integrating AI powered capacity modeling
with traditional agile planning teams

32
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:29,659
can significantly improve their sprint
completion rates and estimate accuracy.

33
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:35,359
The key lies in combining machine
intelligence with human expertise

34
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:38,989
to create more realistic,
achievable sprint commitments.

35
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:41,439
How is that going to be helpful?

36
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:47,139
Predictive ANA analytics for agile
velocity forecasting where predictive

37
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:51,709
sprint capacity on team composition,
complexity patterns, and historical

38
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:56,959
performance trends can be delivered,
so can be derived multi-dimensional

39
00:02:57,169 --> 00:03:02,509
prioritization, BA balance, business
values, technical dependencies, risk

40
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:06,919
factors, and resource availability
for optimal backlog sequencing.

41
00:03:07,524 --> 00:03:13,104
And shortened planning cycles reduce
planning overhead while whitelist

42
00:03:13,164 --> 00:03:18,774
improving accuracy through AI assisted
estimations and dependency mapping.

43
00:03:19,274 --> 00:03:21,644
We are good that we have
the all predictability.

44
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:24,654
So how does it works actually?

45
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:28,704
Graph paste, backlog,
intelligence dependency mapping.

46
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:33,864
AI analyzes relation between user
stories, identify hidden dependencies

47
00:03:33,864 --> 00:03:38,574
and cross team coordination needs
that traditional planning might miss.

48
00:03:39,004 --> 00:03:43,744
If there is a human who is planning, they
might miss some parts of our dependencies

49
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:49,265
between cross-functional teams, but AI
helps us in that area and technical depth.

50
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:50,219
Visibility.

51
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,869
So the common problem that today's
Agile team mostly fails is they realize

52
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:59,999
there is a technical depth which is
hidden after too many sprints pattern.

53
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:05,764
So in this space, even AI can help us with
identifying the technical depths upfront.

54
00:04:06,264 --> 00:04:08,034
So real time risk protection.

55
00:04:08,454 --> 00:04:14,484
So NLP, power Insights, natural language
crossing analysis, standup notes,

56
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:19,824
comments and communications to detect
sentiment shifts and collaboration issues.

57
00:04:20,064 --> 00:04:24,204
So in Agile, there is a most
common dysfunction that we observe.

58
00:04:24,204 --> 00:04:30,954
The team don't communicate, so we can
have an AI as a spy or a help or a

59
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:33,480
coordinator, which can help us with that.

60
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,360
Then velocity tracking monitors,
sprint over sprint trends to identify

61
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,700
declining performance pattern before
they impact delivery commitments.

62
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,230
Then behavioral signals, track meeting
participation and collaboration patterns.

63
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,090
In a, as I there are too many
meetings and we don't know how

64
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,275
many of them are effective.

65
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:56,135
So AI can be can give us some
important notes out of that

66
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:57,859
meeting, which will help the team.

67
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:00,174
Then burnout prevention.

68
00:05:00,905 --> 00:05:05,405
We might tend to overload a
particular person with lots of loads.

69
00:05:05,675 --> 00:05:09,365
So AI help us identify this particular
person has so much load in the

70
00:05:09,365 --> 00:05:13,115
current sprint, and he's expected
to work the same in the next sprint.

71
00:05:13,115 --> 00:05:14,585
Then there's a chance of burnout.

72
00:05:14,585 --> 00:05:18,094
So AI help us even to identify
the moods of the team.

73
00:05:18,425 --> 00:05:23,905
In that case, cross-functional resource
optimization, intelligent as assignment.

74
00:05:24,405 --> 00:05:29,445
So AI assisted resource allocation
enhances throughput by mapping team

75
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:33,765
member performance availability
and skill development goals

76
00:05:34,005 --> 00:05:36,255
to optimal work assignments.

77
00:05:36,615 --> 00:05:42,285
The system considers individual growth
objectives alongside delivery needs,

78
00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:46,430
creating a balance between project
success and professional development.

79
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,340
So it helps with the core
functional resources as well.

80
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,179
Responsibility, AI adoption, transparency
frameworks, clear documentation of

81
00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:00,219
ai decision making processes, ensures
steam understand how recommendations are

82
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:02,859
generated and can challenge assumptions.

83
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,229
Ethical guardrails, establish
boundaries around AI usage particularly.

84
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:13,119
Regarding team monitoring to
maintain trust and respect individual

85
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:15,089
privacy explainability models.

86
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:20,129
So AI must provide some clear reasoning
for their suggestions only that there

87
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:25,144
will be trust built with the team while
they take the suggestions of from ai.

88
00:06:25,644 --> 00:06:29,334
Keeping humans in the loop
argument, not replacement.

89
00:06:29,664 --> 00:06:34,284
So AI serves as a decision support
system, providing insights and

90
00:06:34,284 --> 00:06:38,924
recommendations while reserving
human judgment and team anatomy.

91
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,314
Final decision still remains with humans.

92
00:06:42,554 --> 00:06:45,434
We are not trying to
replace any human with ai.

93
00:06:45,494 --> 00:06:48,194
We are just trying it to
be a helpful model for us.

94
00:06:48,694 --> 00:06:50,254
Preserving team dynamics.

95
00:06:50,404 --> 00:06:54,994
Successful AI integration strengthens
rather than undermines collaboration,

96
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:59,974
moral and psychological safety
within agile teams, the technology

97
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:04,174
supports the human elements that
make agile effective communication,

98
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,884
trust, and continuous improvement.

99
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,619
See your practical playbook.

100
00:07:08,574 --> 00:07:10,224
Assess current state.

101
00:07:10,434 --> 00:07:14,334
Start with pilot projects,
train and enable teams.

102
00:07:14,544 --> 00:07:15,984
Iterate and improve.

103
00:07:16,484 --> 00:07:18,434
The future of Agile delivery.

104
00:07:18,764 --> 00:07:22,304
AI powered Agile isn't about
replacing human expertise.

105
00:07:22,634 --> 00:07:27,584
It's about amplifying it By
combining machine intelligence

106
00:07:27,584 --> 00:07:32,294
with human creativity, empathy,
and judgment, we create delivery

107
00:07:32,294 --> 00:07:36,794
systems that are more predictable,
more resonant, and more humane.

108
00:07:37,294 --> 00:07:41,974
I would like to thank each one of
you for giving me this opportunity.

109
00:07:42,334 --> 00:07:49,324
As I say, AI is a helpful model, not
seriously replacing any humans, so we can

110
00:07:49,324 --> 00:07:52,859
best use AI in our agile world as well.
