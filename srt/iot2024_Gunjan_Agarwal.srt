00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,550
Hello, good morning, good afternoon
and good evening everyone.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,880
My name is Gunjan Agarwal and I'm
thrilled to be here to share insights

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,989
on crafting compelling AR VR products
and leveraging AI to accelerate

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,970
development and improve user experience.

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,880
A bit about me, having worked at
Meta, Nutanix, and Amazon, I have been

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,410
fortunate to lead some groundbreaking
projects combining technical

7
00:00:23,419 --> 00:00:25,359
innovation with user centric design.

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,979
Today, I'll share some of my
learnings to help you as technical

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,229
leaders navigate this exciting space.

10
00:00:31,729 --> 00:00:35,149
A quick disclaimer, this presentation
is based entirely on my personal

11
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:38,999
experience and independent research
with no connection to my professional

12
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:40,690
roles or responsibilities at Meta.

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,000
With that, let's dive into the
agenda to frame today's discussion.

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,229
So we'll start by defining XR and why
it's a game changer for industries.

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,177
Next we'll examine how XR
development compares to traditional

16
00:00:54,177 --> 00:00:55,950
platforms like mobile and web.

17
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,620
Then we'll explore the challenges unique
to XR and how to overcome them before

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,970
concluding with actionable tips for
building scalable products and integrating

19
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,149
AI into the processes and practices.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,635
By the end of this talk, I hope you
leave with both strategic insights and

21
00:01:11,635 --> 00:01:13,685
practical tools to apply in your road.

22
00:01:14,085 --> 00:01:17,815
And for those of you completely new
to this space, I hope you will go back

23
00:01:17,825 --> 00:01:22,325
excited, knowing a bit more about the
possibilities in this upcoming Skibase.

24
00:01:23,085 --> 00:01:25,745
Now, a couple of more points
on what to expect and what not

25
00:01:25,754 --> 00:01:26,834
to expect from this session.

26
00:01:27,334 --> 00:01:30,424
Firstly, given the limited time
we have today, I won't be able

27
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:34,164
to do a deep dive into all the
integrate details of XR development.

28
00:01:34,664 --> 00:01:38,574
However, my goal is to equip you with
the foundational knowledge and point

29
00:01:38,584 --> 00:01:40,394
you in the right resources direction.

30
00:01:41,304 --> 00:01:46,164
Secondly, while much of my focus today
will center on VR and X, AR development,

31
00:01:46,544 --> 00:01:49,674
particularly with headsets, it's
important to note that many of the

32
00:01:49,684 --> 00:01:53,184
concepts and techniques I'll discuss,
especially from a software development

33
00:01:53,184 --> 00:01:58,684
perspective, are really relevant to
2D game and application development.

34
00:01:58,954 --> 00:02:01,794
Now this makes this knowledge
transferable and valuable across

35
00:02:01,794 --> 00:02:03,454
a wide range of platforms.

36
00:02:03,854 --> 00:02:05,204
With that, let's get going.

37
00:02:05,704 --> 00:02:06,654
So what is XR?

38
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:12,094
Now XR or Extended Reality is basically an
umbrella term for immersive technologies

39
00:02:12,094 --> 00:02:15,934
that blend the physical and the digital
worlds to create interactive experiences.

40
00:02:16,534 --> 00:02:20,014
It encompasses three key
categories, Augmented Reality,

41
00:02:20,104 --> 00:02:22,259
Virtual Reality and Mixed Reality.

42
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:27,559
What is augmented reality now AR
overlays digital elements like images

43
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,889
text or example Or animations onto the
real world enhancing what and interact

44
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:37,149
with For example apps like ikea place
lets you visualize the furniture in

45
00:02:37,149 --> 00:02:41,589
your home Or snapchat filters overlay
fun effects on your face in real time

46
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:47,229
VR, on the other hand, fully immerses
you in computer generated environment,

47
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:48,929
cutting you off from the physical world.

48
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:54,459
Using devices like MetaQuest, PlayStation
VR, we can explore virtual spaces,

49
00:02:54,499 --> 00:02:58,999
play games, or even train for surgery
in completely simulated environments.

50
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:02,639
Now, mixed reality is
basically a mix of both of it.

51
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,009
It merges the two.

52
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,989
The physical and the digital world
allowing them to coexist and interact

53
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:13,029
seamlessly Unlike ar which only
overlays digital content Mr enables

54
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:16,419
users to manipulate and interact
with virtual objects as though they

55
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:20,609
are part of the real world Devices
like microsoft's hololens are good.

56
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:26,239
Good example and metacoast 3 are good
example of mr technology Now why is

57
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,799
xr development more relevant than ever
You Now XR is revolutionizing gaming,

58
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:34,999
healthcare, education, and retail.

59
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:41,229
Think of PlayStation VR to defining,
redefining gaming, or also VR, enhancing

60
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:42,689
surgical training in healthcare.

61
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:46,899
So across the industry, XR is
basically making a huge impact and

62
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:48,839
bringing about a lot of change.

63
00:03:49,339 --> 00:03:53,729
In terms of market opportunity, with
a projected 250 billion market size

64
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:58,479
by 2027, driven by device innovations
and heavy investment from companies

65
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,369
like Meta, Microsoft, Google,
Sony, XR is quickly transitioning

66
00:04:02,369 --> 00:04:03,989
from futuristic to mainstream.

67
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:09,509
Now, but developing for XR brings its own
complexities, which we'll explore shortly.

68
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:13,049
Many of us here are coming from
software development background.

69
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:16,209
would have experience with
developing for mobile desktop.

70
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,329
So I thought it would be
useful to contrast the two.

71
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:23,799
Unlike mobile and web, XR requires real
time 3d environments, which demand for 3d

72
00:04:23,809 --> 00:04:26,029
modeling, complex rendering, and physics.

73
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,298
Advanced spatial awareness and low
latency are a must for seamless user

74
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:34,039
experience and to avoid discomfort.

75
00:04:34,309 --> 00:04:38,609
Development involves leveraging game
engines like Unity or Unreal, optimizing

76
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:42,709
for 3D assets, and ensuring secure
and responsive interactions across

77
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:46,789
devices, and understanding unique
privacy concerns in shared spaces.

78
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:50,189
With that, let's dive into
the capabilities and tools

79
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,879
that power XR development.

80
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:55,409
We'll first start by spending
some time understanding the

81
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,479
anatomy of an XMR headset.

82
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:01,359
A mixed reality headset is an
advanced device that blends virtual

83
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:05,359
elements with immersive experiences.

84
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:11,159
Key components include lenses and
screens for displaying visuals, sensors

85
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:15,899
and cameras for tracking, spatial audio
systems and microphones for audio and

86
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:21,329
voice, controllers with haptics and
powerful CPUs and GPUs for processing.

87
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:25,164
High refresh rates, typically 90
hertz or more, are essential to

88
00:05:25,204 --> 00:05:29,174
deliver smooth visuals and minimize
latency, ensuring a convincing

89
00:05:29,214 --> 00:05:30,614
and comfortable user experience.

90
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:34,894
Now, what gives a sense of immersion
and realism in an MR headset?

91
00:05:35,704 --> 00:05:39,934
A key element of realism in 3D
headsets lies in how they simulate

92
00:05:39,934 --> 00:05:43,956
depth, sound, and spatial awareness
to mimic real world experiences.

93
00:05:43,956 --> 00:05:48,424
As far as realism is concerned, there are
three aspects that we should talk about.

94
00:05:48,944 --> 00:05:51,534
First is Lenses and Depth Perception.

95
00:05:52,094 --> 00:05:56,204
The lenses in a 3D headset magnify the
visuals displayed on the screen and

96
00:05:56,204 --> 00:06:02,196
present slightly different perspectives
of the same image to the eye.

97
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:07,924
Now this process known as stereoscopy
creates a sense of depth replicating

98
00:06:07,974 --> 00:06:10,134
how our eyes perceive the real world.

99
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:14,464
Combined with motion tracking, it enables
users to see their environment shift

100
00:06:14,464 --> 00:06:16,274
naturally as they move their heads.

101
00:06:17,004 --> 00:06:20,664
Other aspect is spatial audio,
which gives a sense of realism.

102
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:24,934
Realism is further enhanced through
spatial audio, which adapts sound

103
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:28,954
based on distance, direction, and
environmental factors like echos.

104
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:29,984
Excuse me.

105
00:06:30,804 --> 00:06:36,044
For example, sounds grow louder as you
approach a sound, as you approach a

106
00:06:36,044 --> 00:06:40,604
sound source, or shift position as you
turn your head, providing an immersive

107
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:41,814
and dynamic auditory experience.

108
00:06:42,314 --> 00:06:46,424
Field of view and tracking is another
aspect which basically give a sense of

109
00:06:46,464 --> 00:06:49,104
immersion and realism in a MR headset.

110
00:06:49,694 --> 00:06:53,324
Now headsets further expand on the
realism by offering a wide field of

111
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:57,894
view and precise head tracking, allowing
users to explore environments naturally.

112
00:06:58,204 --> 00:07:01,734
As user turn their head, they can see
more of the virtual or the augmented space

113
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:04,124
just as they would in the physical world.

114
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:08,554
So all of these things come together to
give a sense of immersion and realism

115
00:07:08,564 --> 00:07:10,564
when someone puts on a MR headset.

116
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:14,194
Now with that, let's move on to
understand some of the code software

117
00:07:14,244 --> 00:07:16,944
concepts for AR VR development.

118
00:07:17,444 --> 00:07:21,354
With Now one of the core pieces of
software that we need to familiarize

119
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:25,874
ourselves with is a game engine like
unity or unreal engine A game engine is a

120
00:07:25,874 --> 00:07:30,864
very powerful software framework used in
ar vr development to render 3d graphics

121
00:07:30,944 --> 00:07:35,434
Manage physics process interactions and
more Now we'll talk about some of the key

122
00:07:35,434 --> 00:07:37,234
capabilities provided by the game engine.

123
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:41,474
Let's start by talking about 3d
graphics and rendering Game engines

124
00:07:41,474 --> 00:07:45,224
are optimized to render realistic,
high quality 3D graphics essential

125
00:07:45,224 --> 00:07:47,204
for immersive AR VR experiences.

126
00:07:47,754 --> 00:07:52,244
They manage lighting, shading, textures,
and other visual elements that help

127
00:07:52,284 --> 00:07:54,024
create a convincing virtual world.

128
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:58,214
Physics simulation and 3D
lighting is another capability

129
00:07:58,214 --> 00:07:59,644
provided by the game engines.

130
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,179
The game engines have physics
engine that simulate real world

131
00:08:03,179 --> 00:08:06,749
behaviors such as gravity,
collision, and object interactions.

132
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,989
This is crucial in VR to maintain
a sense of realism as user expect

133
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:14,159
virtual objects to respond to
actions similarly to physical.

134
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:15,629
objects.

135
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:19,539
Game engines are also optimized
for real time processing.

136
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:24,159
Now ARVR requires real time
performance to reduce latency, which

137
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:26,089
is necessary to avoid motion sickness.

138
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:29,069
Game engines are optimized
to process actions and render

139
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:30,549
changes in milliseconds.

140
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:32,829
So this is another crucial
aspect of game engine.

141
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:37,959
Spatial audio integration, like we
briefly discussed about earlier, is also a

142
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:39,899
capability provided with the game engine.

143
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:44,059
Sound is crucial, as we know, in
AR VR for immersion, game engines

144
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,419
typically support spatial audio,
which allows sound to be positioned

145
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:49,269
in 3D space relative to the user.

146
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:53,289
This enhances the feeling of presence,
as user can perceive sound coming from

147
00:08:53,289 --> 00:08:56,659
specific direction and distance, like
we briefly spoke about earlier as well.

148
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:00,349
Animation scripting is another
capability provided by a game engine.

149
00:09:00,869 --> 00:09:04,849
Game engines support custom animation
scripting, often using C sharp

150
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:09,459
in Unity or C in Unreal, allowing
developers to create interactive

151
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:11,819
scenarios and dynamic object behaviors.

152
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:13,644
Support for interactive.

153
00:09:13,944 --> 00:09:17,904
interaction input is another capability
that the game engines provide These

154
00:09:17,954 --> 00:09:21,624
game engines are designed to handle
user input from vr controllers hand

155
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:26,034
tracking systems and even voice commands
This enable more natural and intuitive

156
00:09:26,064 --> 00:09:30,554
way to interact with virtual objects
making arvr applications more engaging

157
00:09:31,054 --> 00:09:34,584
Other aspect or capability provided
by game engine is scene management.

158
00:09:35,004 --> 00:09:39,024
Now these game engines allow developers
to organize complex scenes with multiple

159
00:09:39,024 --> 00:09:40,944
objects, layers, and environments.

160
00:09:41,294 --> 00:09:45,094
In AR VR, this is especially helpful
for creating layered experiences

161
00:09:45,094 --> 00:09:48,654
where virtual objects can interact
with the physical spaces and each

162
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:50,274
other in highly complex ways.

163
00:09:51,274 --> 00:09:55,354
Developers tools and asset store is
another aspect which is very important

164
00:09:55,384 --> 00:09:57,524
and provided by most of the game engines.

165
00:09:58,004 --> 00:10:01,164
These game engines come with a wide
range of developer tools, debugging

166
00:10:01,174 --> 00:10:05,814
features, and asset stores with pre
made objects, textures, and animations.

167
00:10:06,154 --> 00:10:09,914
These tools help streamline AR
VR development, enabling faster

168
00:10:09,914 --> 00:10:11,254
iterations and prototyping.

169
00:10:11,754 --> 00:10:15,464
Now lastly cross platform support
is another big capability generally

170
00:10:15,464 --> 00:10:18,754
provided by game engines Now these
game engines often support multiple

171
00:10:18,754 --> 00:10:26,684
platforms like ios android oculus and
hololens Etc allowing arvr application

172
00:10:26,684 --> 00:10:28,684
that can run on various devices

173
00:10:29,184 --> 00:10:34,074
Now we covered unity which is basically
the core piece of software that one needs

174
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:40,174
to be very familiar with if they are
developing for arvr Or games But there

175
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:43,244
is another aspect which we need to be
very familiar with when developing for

176
00:10:43,244 --> 00:10:47,404
AR VR Now for anyone working on creating
immersive experiences like virtual

177
00:10:47,404 --> 00:10:51,834
worlds a deep understanding of concepts
such as shaders and materials Lighting

178
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:56,434
and cameras vfx and animation is very
important These are particularly useful

179
00:10:56,564 --> 00:11:00,754
for 3d artists involved in creating assets
and the words which basically are used

180
00:11:00,754 --> 00:11:05,094
by engineers to put together the whole
You know experience of the game together

181
00:11:05,594 --> 00:11:10,229
I'll briefly explain these Shaders and
materials, basically, let's start by

182
00:11:10,229 --> 00:11:11,749
talking about shaders and materials.

183
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:15,239
3D shapes are generally
represented using meshes.

184
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:18,409
To draw something in Unity, you must
provide information that describes

185
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:21,779
the shape and the information that
describes the appearance of its surface.

186
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:25,809
You use meshes to describe
shape and materials to describe

187
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:27,379
appearance and surfaces.

188
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:32,599
Shaders, pixel colors for
realistic or stylized visuals.

189
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:34,979
There's another thing we should
talk about, which is a render

190
00:11:34,979 --> 00:11:38,979
pipeline, which basically process
scene objects for display, right?

191
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:43,599
They basically look at what is visible
in the scene and cull what is out

192
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:47,239
of the scene, include what is there
in the scene to continuously update,

193
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:50,459
render, update and render the display.

194
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:51,724
There are different kinds of pipelines.

195
00:11:51,804 --> 00:11:56,854
render pipelines like URP, HDRP, or
built in pipelines, which one needs

196
00:11:56,854 --> 00:11:57,924
to familiarize themselves with.

197
00:11:58,424 --> 00:12:00,624
Let's talk about now lighting and cameras.

198
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:05,534
Now lighting models, real world
light behavior with adjustable global

199
00:12:05,534 --> 00:12:07,504
illumination and lighting modes.

200
00:12:07,554 --> 00:12:10,734
There are things like baked
lighting, real time lighting

201
00:12:10,734 --> 00:12:12,064
which one needs to understand.

202
00:12:12,814 --> 00:12:16,594
Now cameras basically flatten 3D
scenes for 2D screens capturing and

203
00:12:16,594 --> 00:12:18,834
presenting the game world to players.

204
00:12:19,334 --> 00:12:24,424
Okay, so what is vfx and animation now
vfx include particle systems decals

205
00:12:24,424 --> 00:12:29,514
large scale graphical effects to enhance
immersion So for example a fire coming on

206
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:36,304
the screen or a vfx Effect of emotes and
all of those things are basically the vfx

207
00:12:36,734 --> 00:12:41,584
capabilities which basically are designed
by artists Now animation provides features

208
00:12:41,614 --> 00:12:45,624
like retargeting, runtime control, state
machines, and blend, blend shapes for

209
00:12:45,624 --> 00:12:47,574
lifelike motion and facial expression.

210
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:50,374
So animation is something which
is also very important for us to

211
00:12:50,374 --> 00:12:51,804
understand when developing for ARVR.

212
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:55,284
Another crucial aspect that one
needs to familiarize themselves

213
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:57,004
with is post processing.

214
00:12:57,484 --> 00:13:00,334
Now, post processing is basically
about visual enhancements via

215
00:13:00,334 --> 00:13:03,224
camera applied effects like
filters and image corrections.

216
00:13:03,564 --> 00:13:07,774
Realistic 3D audio support, like
directional sound, distance effects,

217
00:13:07,774 --> 00:13:12,284
and environmental acoustics like echoes
are also part of post processing.

218
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:15,789
Lastly, UI design and prototyping.

219
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:19,909
This basically involves tools for
creating user friendly interfaces and

220
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:22,239
quick prototyping of assets and ideas.

221
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:26,179
There are various tools which basically
are used by the creative community

222
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:30,829
to do all of this work, and then
create, immersive 3D experiences.

223
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:34,679
There are tools like Blender, Unity,
ProBuilder, Maya, which basically

224
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:38,159
are very popular among the creative
community for creating these assets.

225
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:42,169
And lastly, let's take a quick
view of different, AR SDKs that

226
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:43,719
can be used for AR development.

227
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:48,359
we'll talk a few, talk about a few popular
ones like ARKit, ARCore and Vuforia.

228
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:52,689
For example, ARKit is provided by Apple,
quite popular among, iOS developers.

229
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:54,809
ARCore likely supported by Google.

230
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:57,254
Very famous among Android developers.

231
00:13:57,514 --> 00:14:01,074
Euphoria is another very popular,
AR SDK, and with a very good

232
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:04,994
integration with Unity, is very,
is another popular, AR SDK.

233
00:14:05,024 --> 00:14:08,544
Likewise, there are many others which,
which can be leveraged to do AR.

234
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:14,549
Now we covered about, tools like
Game Engine, AR SDKs, and talk

235
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,079
about different creative concepts.

236
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:19,889
Now, despite these tools,
building XR applications is quite

237
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:22,299
challenging, which we'll discuss now.

238
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:25,249
So what are the challenges
unique to XR development?

239
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:29,099
Now, creating a successful AR
VR product is no small feat.

240
00:14:29,479 --> 00:14:32,449
Let's explore some of these unique
challenges developers face and

241
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:34,059
techniques to overcome them.

242
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:38,099
First, let's start by talking
about hardware limitations.

243
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:40,899
Now, there are several hardware
limitations, such as limited

244
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:44,379
processing power, battery life,
form factor and comfort, display

245
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:48,769
quality, etc., that one needs to pay
attention to when developing for XR.

246
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:54,669
Let's start talking about each of these,
basically hardware related challenges.

247
00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:57,199
So let's start by talking
about processing power.

248
00:14:57,749 --> 00:15:01,199
Now AR VR experiences are
resource intensive, demanding

249
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,609
high computation power to render
realistic graphic at high frame rates.

250
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:10,929
Developers must optimize their code,
manage memory usage efficiently to

251
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:14,749
ensure a great, great, result from
the processing power perspective.

252
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:19,009
Other hardware limitation is
battery or challenges battery life.

253
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:23,619
Achieving a balance between performance
and battery life consumption is critical,

254
00:15:23,619 --> 00:15:25,599
especially for standalone devices.

255
00:15:26,109 --> 00:15:30,149
Techniques like 4 bit rendering where only
area that the user is directly looking

256
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:34,252
at is rendered in high detail helps
save processing power and battery life.

257
00:15:34,252 --> 00:15:37,699
Likewise, there are other techniques
which are very important to, which

258
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:40,899
are very important for taking
consideration of battery life.

259
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,359
Form factor and comfort is another aspect
from the hardware perspective, which

260
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,359
XR developers need to pay attention to.

261
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:50,549
The physical design of
headset impacts user adoption.

262
00:15:50,609 --> 00:15:54,799
Reducing weight, improving ergonomics,
and balancing the headset are priorities

263
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:59,459
to ensure user can wear devices for
extended periods of time comfortably.

264
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,089
Lastly, from the hardware perspective,
let's talk about display quality.

265
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:06,469
Now, fast refresh rates and high
resolutions are necessary to deliver

266
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:10,239
a smooth visual like we have spoken
about earlier, but they also introduce

267
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,159
challenges like heat generation
and increased power consumption.

268
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:17,889
Display technologies like OLED, micro
LED are being explored to provide

269
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:19,849
better visuals without these trade offs.

270
00:16:20,349 --> 00:16:24,799
With that, let's move on to talk about
latency and motion sickness as another

271
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:26,649
challenge unique to XR development.

272
00:16:27,349 --> 00:16:29,529
Now latency is a
significant challenge in VR.

273
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:33,669
If there is even a small delay between
the user's physical environment

274
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:37,529
and visuals being displayed, it can
lead to cyber sickness ensuring.

275
00:16:37,969 --> 00:16:41,789
Now ensuring low latency requires
efficient tracking algorithms.

276
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:44,839
Now real time tracking and
rendering algorithms are very

277
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:47,239
important to keep the experience.

278
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:50,469
This includes head tracking, eye
tracking, and position tracking.

279
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:53,289
Basically, all the tracking that we
are doing is basically has to be in

280
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:55,249
real time to avoid any sort of latency.

281
00:16:55,819 --> 00:16:57,799
Otherwise, users generally
get motion sickness.

282
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:02,309
Another technique which is very useful
to avoid latency and reduce motion

283
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:04,113
sickness is using predictive algorithms.

284
00:17:04,113 --> 00:17:08,279
Now, predictive algorithms can help
compensate for latency by predicting

285
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:12,119
the user's next move and adjusting the
visuals accordingly, ensuring that the

286
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,274
user remains immersed without any lag.

287
00:17:14,774 --> 00:17:18,744
Then let's talk about tracking through
multiple sensors, which is challenging

288
00:17:18,844 --> 00:17:20,864
as far as XR development is concerned.

289
00:17:21,494 --> 00:17:25,164
Now, reliable tracking of head, hand,
and body movements is essential.

290
00:17:25,164 --> 00:17:30,994
AR, VR devices rely on sensors like
cameras, gyroscopes, and accelerometers.

291
00:17:31,414 --> 00:17:35,304
Developing robust sensor fusion algorithms
that integrates data from multiple

292
00:17:35,414 --> 00:17:39,264
sensors is one of the techniques that
allow for accurate and responsive

293
00:17:39,264 --> 00:17:41,364
tracking, which is crucial for immersion.

294
00:17:41,864 --> 00:17:44,344
Now content creation in 3D
modeling is another challenge

295
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,194
very unique to XR development.

296
00:17:46,894 --> 00:17:50,744
High quality 3D content is essential
for creating immersive experiences.

297
00:17:50,844 --> 00:17:54,694
However, creating a detailed model
that looks realistic while running

298
00:17:54,694 --> 00:17:57,934
smoothly across different hardware
configurations is a big challenge.

299
00:17:58,334 --> 00:18:01,564
Developers use several optimization
techniques like level of

300
00:18:01,564 --> 00:18:03,264
details and texture compression.

301
00:18:03,764 --> 00:18:07,244
Level of detail reduce the complexity
of 3D model when they are far

302
00:18:07,324 --> 00:18:10,784
away and ensuring performance
without sacrificing visual quality.

303
00:18:11,394 --> 00:18:15,314
Text compression reduce texture
size without, texture compression

304
00:18:15,324 --> 00:18:18,374
reduce texture size without
significant loss in detail to

305
00:18:18,374 --> 00:18:20,154
optimize load time and memory usage.

306
00:18:20,154 --> 00:18:25,234
Now let's talk about debugging
and testing challenges.

307
00:18:25,579 --> 00:18:29,469
Testing AR VR requires evaluating
performance across various environments,

308
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,339
device types, and user scenarios.

309
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:34,909
Developers use a combination of
simulated environments and real world

310
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:36,919
testing to address potential issues.

311
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:41,619
Automated testing tools for stress
testing, the rendering pipeline,

312
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:46,549
and sensor inputs can also help
identify certain bottlenecks.

313
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:52,129
The user safety and health is another
challenge which is very unique to XR

314
00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:56,259
development Ensuring the safety and
comfort of user is critical extended

315
00:18:56,259 --> 00:19:01,919
use of VR can lead to eye strain and
physical discomfort as well as Hazards, so

316
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,309
developers need to design experiences that
minimize this effect and encourage regular

317
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:11,499
breaks Integrating safety features like a
boundary system like guardian can prevent

318
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:14,339
users from bumping into real world objects

319
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:19,189
Now, we spoke about these challenges
and some of these techniques to overcome

320
00:19:19,189 --> 00:19:23,589
these challenges, but nonetheless,
overcoming these challenges require a

321
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:28,909
careful optimization around strategies,
which we will talk about next.

322
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:33,349
So what does it take to build
a lovable and scalable XR

323
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:34,589
product?

324
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:40,019
Now buildings a lovable and scalable
excel product that scales across

325
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:44,579
devices and user exp, and users and
is loved by customers require paying

326
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:46,559
attention to several key aspects.

327
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:50,459
And we'll talk about three key areas,
which is focus on user design and

328
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:55,709
experience optimizing performance and
focus of inter focus on interoperability

329
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:57,239
and ecosystem integration.

330
00:19:57,894 --> 00:20:01,384
Let's start by talking about
focus on user experience design.

331
00:20:02,124 --> 00:20:04,744
Now AR and VR is all about
spatial interactions.

332
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:08,824
The way users move and interact with
virtual objects must feel natural.

333
00:20:09,324 --> 00:20:12,974
Some of the areas to pay
attention to are spatial design.

334
00:20:13,424 --> 00:20:16,444
Developers need to leverage
principles of spatial design to create

335
00:20:16,444 --> 00:20:19,114
intuitive and engaging experiences.

336
00:20:19,614 --> 00:20:24,724
Environment variability is another aspect
which is related to user experience.

337
00:20:24,794 --> 00:20:29,154
Now AR experiences must work well in
diverse settings from bright outdoor

338
00:20:29,164 --> 00:20:30,884
environments to dim indoor ones.

339
00:20:31,304 --> 00:20:34,504
Developers can use techniques
like adaptive lighting and robust

340
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,214
tracking to ensure consistency.

341
00:20:36,714 --> 00:20:39,494
Adaptive UI UX for varied user scenarios.

342
00:20:39,764 --> 00:20:42,254
is another thing which one
needs to pay attention to.

343
00:20:42,654 --> 00:20:45,744
Now, users may switch between indoor
and outdoor setting, or from sitting

344
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:49,894
to standing, designing adaptive UI UX
ensures that experience remain intuitive

345
00:20:49,894 --> 00:20:52,264
and responsive across varied scenarios.

346
00:20:52,764 --> 00:20:57,094
Now, optimizing for performance, is
another critical aspect of building

347
00:20:57,094 --> 00:20:59,974
a lovable and great, XR experience.

348
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:04,144
As you've already seen, performance is
a critical aspect for XR application.

349
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:07,249
We can optimize performance
in several ways.

350
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:11,319
First is we can adopt a low latency
architecture like edge computing

351
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:13,289
which can really help minimize delays.

352
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:17,439
We can also optimize 3d content as
you have seen 3d content is very

353
00:21:18,334 --> 00:21:21,854
computation heavy and have involved
involves a performance penalty.

354
00:21:22,254 --> 00:21:26,654
So we can use best practices in
optimizing the 3d entry content 3d

355
00:21:26,724 --> 00:21:31,674
content which can Ensure high performance
without sacrificing visual quality.

356
00:21:31,704 --> 00:21:35,914
This involves efficient use of textures
shader and lighting We should also pay

357
00:21:35,914 --> 00:21:41,494
attention to minimizing bandwidth usage by
finding ways To reduce the bandwidth usage

358
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:44,924
without finding qualities, techniques
like adaptive streaming and compression

359
00:21:44,944 --> 00:21:46,804
can be very beneficial in this regard.

360
00:21:47,304 --> 00:21:50,664
Lastly, let's talk about interoperability
and ecosystem integration.

361
00:21:51,084 --> 00:21:54,974
We briefly touched upon the concept of
interoperability earlier, but creating a

362
00:21:54,974 --> 00:21:59,714
robust ecosystem that supports multiple
devices and platforms ensures that the

363
00:21:59,714 --> 00:22:05,897
users have seamless experience, whether
they are on mobile, VR, or desktop.

364
00:22:05,897 --> 00:22:08,367
Interoperability can also
encourage third party developers

365
00:22:08,457 --> 00:22:09,247
to build on your platform.

366
00:22:10,217 --> 00:22:15,937
Encouraging application, you know spread
from this aspect we can focus on following

367
00:22:15,957 --> 00:22:20,097
like You know following like we can start
with we can think about x device and

368
00:22:20,147 --> 00:22:24,527
platform compatibility So for this we
should build using standard methods that

369
00:22:24,537 --> 00:22:29,227
allow your apps to work across devices
and headsets and platforms We can also

370
00:22:29,297 --> 00:22:33,197
adopt standard tools and skill sets Now
allowing use of standards and popular

371
00:22:33,197 --> 00:22:36,477
tools such as unity for development
encourages third party developers

372
00:22:36,507 --> 00:22:41,407
to develop apps And integrations
enriching user experience and enhancing

373
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:43,007
further reach of your application

374
00:22:43,507 --> 00:22:49,147
So we've spoken about, so far about the
challenges unique to XR development, what

375
00:22:49,157 --> 00:22:53,297
the, what are the key software concepts
of XR development and how can we overcome

376
00:22:53,507 --> 00:22:56,397
some of the challenges we've spoken
about and different tools used, right?

377
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:01,367
I want to end this, session by spending
some time talking about how can

378
00:23:01,377 --> 00:23:06,347
we leverage AI to basically create
compelling XR experiences, right?

379
00:23:06,347 --> 00:23:11,137
As we've spoken about, creating compelling
XR products demands significant effort.

380
00:23:11,412 --> 00:23:15,712
But AI can accelerate development, enhance
user experience, and empower creator.

381
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:19,942
So let's start, to look at each of these
aspects in a little bit more detail.

382
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:25,482
Let's start by talking about improving
AR VR development through XI.

383
00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:29,562
Now there are multiple ways in
which AI can, accelerate or improve

384
00:23:29,582 --> 00:23:32,482
AR VR development experience
for the developer themselves.

385
00:23:33,472 --> 00:23:35,922
First is by automated asset creation.

386
00:23:35,992 --> 00:23:40,302
Now 3D assets, textures and
environments saving time for developers.

387
00:23:40,762 --> 00:23:45,702
Tools like DALI enable creators to produce
high quality visuals from simple inputs.

388
00:23:46,602 --> 00:23:50,022
realistic physics and animations
is another area where AI

389
00:23:50,022 --> 00:23:50,992
can help significantly.

390
00:23:50,992 --> 00:23:55,762
AI powered physics engines can simulate
real world behaviors more accurately,

391
00:23:55,762 --> 00:23:57,992
making AR VR applications feel natural.

392
00:23:58,492 --> 00:24:00,882
Another aspect is procedural generation.

393
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:06,742
Now AI enables the automated generation
of complex environment, which is useful

394
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:09,222
for open world VR games and simulation.

395
00:24:09,722 --> 00:24:12,712
Another final aspect is
enhanced testing and debugging.

396
00:24:12,942 --> 00:24:17,192
Now AI can assist in QA processes by
automatically testing interactions and

397
00:24:17,192 --> 00:24:21,552
identifying glitches or bugs in AR VR
environment, which are difficult to catch.

398
00:24:22,052 --> 00:24:25,082
Algorithms, these algorithms can
simulate user interaction, finding edge

399
00:24:25,082 --> 00:24:27,752
cages that humans might otherwise miss.

400
00:24:28,252 --> 00:24:34,042
another area where AI can, significantly,
help improve, the user experience

401
00:24:34,152 --> 00:24:37,262
is, another area is basically
where AI can significantly help

402
00:24:37,262 --> 00:24:39,432
is elevating the user experience.

403
00:24:40,342 --> 00:24:42,272
so there are multiple,
aspects here as well.

404
00:24:42,672 --> 00:24:44,592
for example, personal
personalized interaction.

405
00:24:44,592 --> 00:24:48,552
Now a LL algorithms can personalize
content based on user's preferences

406
00:24:48,552 --> 00:24:52,242
and behaviors, creating more
engaging and tailored experiences.

407
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:58,122
For instance, VR experiences can adapt in
real time to a user's emotional response.

408
00:24:58,422 --> 00:25:01,942
Tracked through AI based,
analysis of biometrics.

409
00:25:02,442 --> 00:25:03,492
AI can also help with.

410
00:25:03,982 --> 00:25:05,252
Natural language processing.

411
00:25:05,512 --> 00:25:08,802
Now NLP powered AI can enable
natural, conversational

412
00:25:08,912 --> 00:25:11,062
interactions with AR VR experiences.

413
00:25:11,452 --> 00:25:15,822
This is useful for applications like
VR education or training simulations

414
00:25:16,122 --> 00:25:20,977
where users can interact with virtual
characters like, like in a human like way.

415
00:25:21,477 --> 00:25:25,437
Now enhanced spatial audio is
another aspect where AI can help

416
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:27,067
improve the user experiences.

417
00:25:27,617 --> 00:25:31,447
AI can help enhance spatial
audio, making sound appear to

418
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:34,717
come from specific direction,
distance, or even specific objects.

419
00:25:35,007 --> 00:25:38,077
Deep learning models can also
personalize audio experience based on

420
00:25:38,077 --> 00:25:39,877
user preferences, immersive experience.

421
00:25:40,327 --> 00:25:41,707
Immersive experience.

422
00:25:42,347 --> 00:25:46,337
Finally, emotion detection and
adaptation is another area in

423
00:25:46,347 --> 00:25:49,917
which AI can significantly help
improve the user experience.

424
00:25:49,957 --> 00:25:53,067
For example, AI can monitor facial
expressions and body language to

425
00:25:53,077 --> 00:25:56,127
direct the user's emotional state
and adapt the experience accordingly.

426
00:25:56,717 --> 00:25:59,887
This is especially useful in VR
training, therapy and gaming.

427
00:26:00,132 --> 00:26:04,302
where real world adaptation can
improve engagement and outcomes.

428
00:26:04,802 --> 00:26:08,182
Lastly, let's talk about
how can AI empower creators.

429
00:26:08,522 --> 00:26:12,082
So there are multiple ways, for
example, content creation assistance.

430
00:26:12,342 --> 00:26:17,202
Now, AI driven tools help creators
draft narratives, creative scripts,

431
00:26:17,252 --> 00:26:21,072
or storylines that adapt to user
choices and behaviors in real time.

432
00:26:21,422 --> 00:26:24,427
For example, a generative model
can assist creators Game writers by

433
00:26:24,427 --> 00:26:26,187
suggesting branching story paths.

434
00:26:26,677 --> 00:26:29,907
AI can also help by, word
authoring, which is basically,

435
00:26:29,947 --> 00:26:31,137
a significant effort otherwise.

436
00:26:31,637 --> 00:26:35,997
lastly, AI can significantly
democratize access to tools, encouraging

437
00:26:35,997 --> 00:26:37,657
more people to create, for AR.

438
00:26:38,087 --> 00:26:42,137
now AI powered low code or no code
platforms like, which basically empower

439
00:26:42,137 --> 00:26:45,127
creators with minimal programming
skills to develop compelling AR VR

440
00:26:45,517 --> 00:26:49,627
experiences, allowing a wide range
of creators to enter the field, which

441
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:53,877
otherwise would be limited because of
the steep learning curve of tools and

442
00:26:53,877 --> 00:26:55,157
technology in this particular area.

443
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:58,107
alright, with that we have come
to the end of the presentation.

444
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:02,637
Hope this was useful as we explore the
transformative potential of xr, the unique

445
00:27:02,637 --> 00:27:07,417
challenges and for of developing for this
platform and the role of creating, role of

446
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:10,297
AI in creating scalable LAN applications.

447
00:27:10,627 --> 00:27:13,587
With that, I want to thank
you, all for your time today.
