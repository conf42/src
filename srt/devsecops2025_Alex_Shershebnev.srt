00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,310
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,430
My name is Alex.

3
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,770
Welcome to my talk about MCP.

4
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,940
We will talk about what it is, how
it can help supercharge your DevOps

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,020
process and how you can do it safely
without opening a security hole.

6
00:00:13,934 --> 00:00:18,375
Now I am head of Myop in DevOps
at a company called Koder.

7
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,865
I also work as devel there as well.

8
00:00:21,475 --> 00:00:26,385
Synder is an AI coordin assistant
which I will show briefly when

9
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:27,765
we will get to that stage.

10
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:28,845
But for now.

11
00:00:29,705 --> 00:00:31,115
A few fun facts about me.

12
00:00:31,535 --> 00:00:34,205
So I've been in it for
more than 10 years now.

13
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:35,715
Mostly in machine learning.

14
00:00:35,805 --> 00:00:38,525
I did of course also lops
and the ops and backend.

15
00:00:38,665 --> 00:00:43,355
I've been building code since they
since the first day pretty much.

16
00:00:43,355 --> 00:00:46,355
So I'm one of the founders
members for the last year.

17
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:48,595
I mostly been working as deral.

18
00:00:49,205 --> 00:00:51,515
This is my win number 52.

19
00:00:51,695 --> 00:00:53,995
And this also resulted
in a lot of flights.

20
00:00:54,965 --> 00:00:59,465
And I also have four main couns,
which I occasionally, between

21
00:00:59,465 --> 00:01:02,815
flights I have a chance to see
back home on Madeira Portugal.

22
00:01:03,315 --> 00:01:08,215
Now, MCP is something that everybody's
talking this year like everybody is

23
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:10,195
trying to create their own MCP server.

24
00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:12,305
But what is MC.

25
00:01:13,215 --> 00:01:17,555
To answer the question and also
why we need MCP, we need to take

26
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:22,845
a step back and talk briefly about
AI or specifically about lms.

27
00:01:22,975 --> 00:01:28,985
Everybody nowadays, when they talk
about ai, they mean LMS and lms.

28
00:01:29,595 --> 00:01:33,165
As you might know, they are trained
to predict the most probable

29
00:01:33,165 --> 00:01:37,185
token or symbol, and sometimes
it still can lead to mistakes.

30
00:01:37,235 --> 00:01:42,395
They are great at detecting patterns,
but they don't still understand

31
00:01:42,425 --> 00:01:44,285
what is behind those patterns.

32
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,930
And of course sometimes this can lead
to some mistakes, some errors, which

33
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,520
for us, for humans doesn't make sense.

34
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,120
But then, as I mentioned, LMS
are great detecting patterns.

35
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:01,230
So this is what we did in this case,
but we all know how AI is with hands,

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,350
so that's not really surprising.

37
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,255
But yeah, jokes inside, joke aside we can.

38
00:02:07,755 --> 00:02:12,705
From this sort, for example, we
can de deduce that LMS actually

39
00:02:12,705 --> 00:02:14,505
lack ground in the physical world.

40
00:02:14,965 --> 00:02:19,595
So what this means is they
sit the models themselves.

41
00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:23,885
They sit somewhere in the cloud and
they don't have actual access to,

42
00:02:23,945 --> 00:02:27,965
to physical world, to your local
machine, to your servers and so on.

43
00:02:28,385 --> 00:02:32,025
And of course if you ask, let's
say, charge GPT about what's

44
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:35,055
the response time for Google, it
wouldn't be able to answer you.

45
00:02:35,385 --> 00:02:38,445
It'll provide some
helpful comments for that.

46
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:43,315
So it might say you can use Ping or
whatever, but of course that's not the

47
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,785
actual answer to our question, right?

48
00:02:44,785 --> 00:02:48,925
So if we were to ask something
more specific to our systems.

49
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:54,594
JGPT or any other LLM wouldn't be able
to help them, who to help us because

50
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:59,304
it it sits somewhere in the cloud and
again, doesn't have access to our servers

51
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,094
or to any servers for that matter.

52
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:06,879
And of course it becomes even worse Again,
if you want, to use your own framework.

53
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:11,439
Few maybe want to use your own
systems like infrastructure and so on.

54
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:16,269
LMS have usually no knowledge about
those, especially if you are developing

55
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:17,949
some in-house company framework.

56
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:22,629
Lms most likely do not know, do
not have any knowledge about those

57
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:27,884
frameworks, and they would just
fall back to those frameworks which

58
00:03:27,884 --> 00:03:29,814
they seen in the open source data.

59
00:03:30,314 --> 00:03:35,534
Technically, we can then replace this
phrase, this version that lms like

60
00:03:35,534 --> 00:03:40,244
ground in the physical world into
lms, can't collect extra context.

61
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,190
And again, by extra context things
like you've seen an example with Bink.

62
00:03:44,649 --> 00:03:48,189
Getting response time is
essentially getting context right?

63
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:48,999
Extra context.

64
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:52,580
So actual response time would
be those milliseconds would be

65
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,225
extra context for LLM to give
us more contextualized answers.

66
00:03:56,725 --> 00:04:01,485
Or access to your sys, to your systems,
to your servers, to your login systems

67
00:04:01,485 --> 00:04:06,945
and so on also allows, would allow
LLM to get extra context to give

68
00:04:06,945 --> 00:04:09,885
you much more personalized answers.

69
00:04:10,695 --> 00:04:16,265
Now the solution to that is let's
allow LLM to use tools, right?

70
00:04:16,265 --> 00:04:19,525
To get to get this extra context
and what could go wrong, right?

71
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:25,225
So we can allow LM. To push code to
production, maybe like some companies

72
00:04:25,225 --> 00:04:30,975
already apparently do this up to
them up to 75% or we can give a lamb

73
00:04:30,975 --> 00:04:33,885
access to the database maybe, right?

74
00:04:33,885 --> 00:04:35,835
Maybe not right date, maybe not right.

75
00:04:35,835 --> 00:04:37,245
Access to the database.

76
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:40,205
'cause it might, for whatever
reason, decide to wipe it.

77
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:45,385
But still be, would be useful
for RLM to get this knowledge.

78
00:04:45,895 --> 00:04:51,875
Now, JUX aide the most common, the
most popular way to give LM access to

79
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,205
tools is MCP or model context Protocol.

80
00:04:56,135 --> 00:05:01,505
And it was introduced by Anthropic roughly
a year ago, I think, in December, 2024.

81
00:05:02,295 --> 00:05:05,785
But since then, it became the
factor standard across the industry.

82
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:09,955
And just to give you an example
OpenAI, the main rival of Atropic

83
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,480
actually also adopted MCP.

84
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:19,739
The latest GBT five, GT 5.1 they can also
work with MCP, but MCP essentially is a

85
00:05:19,739 --> 00:05:22,919
protocol for LLMs to gather extra context.

86
00:05:23,609 --> 00:05:28,439
It is based on recent RPC 2.0, and
essentially it is just a set of structured

87
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:33,879
inputs and outputs, but the main two,
entities, the mental concepts inside MCP

88
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,229
would be MCP host first of all, right?

89
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:42,659
So MCP host is essentially your
LLM your id, which is essentially

90
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:44,280
the proxy between the LLM.

91
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,749
And the MCP server and then
MCP server the second entity is

92
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,489
responsible for two main things.

93
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:55,989
First, it is responsible for advertising
the list of capabilities, the list of

94
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:58,959
tools available to MCP, host to LLM.

95
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:04,629
And second, it is responsible for actually
executing those tools and those tools

96
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:06,979
can access pretty much anything, right?

97
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:10,560
So anything you need to
gather extra context.

98
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,690
And provide it to LLM.

99
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,780
You can convert to MCP server
and it can access, let's say,

100
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,409
local resources, maybe your file
system, maybe trans batch commands.

101
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:24,480
It can also access remote resources, of
course so it can access, for example,

102
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,690
GitHub or Jira or whatever system you use.

103
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,900
So again, essentially whatever,
anything you can convert to, the code,

104
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,969
anything you can access through code
can be converted to MCP server and

105
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:42,290
then used to feed more context to LLM.

106
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:47,369
There are actually several features of
MCP inside the model context protocol.

107
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,809
However, the most known is tools, and this
will be the main focus of our today stock.

108
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:58,869
But I also would recommend to
check out all the other features

109
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:03,609
like resources, prompts, sampling,
'cause they do provide some useful

110
00:07:03,609 --> 00:07:06,149
capabilities on top of MCP tools.

111
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:08,730
But here's an example of the tool.

112
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,600
So on the right over here you
can see the actual implementation

113
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,109
of the tool for creating branch.

114
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:19,729
This is taken from GitHub, MCP server,
and this is actually not the full code.

115
00:07:20,429 --> 00:07:22,279
This is just the
beginning of the function.

116
00:07:22,549 --> 00:07:26,619
So we hear that they define
essentially the description the

117
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:31,089
annotation of the tool and which kind
of parameters it takes as inputs.

118
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:36,659
You can actually see a more compact
description on the left, which is

119
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:42,059
what is actually included into the
prompt and then later fed into LLM.

120
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,999
So as you can see there's
a description, right?

121
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:48,419
So it creates a new branch in GI
repository, GitHub repository.

122
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,459
It takes as input four parameters,
although only three of them are required.

123
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:58,370
And essentially this helps
LLM to decide which tool it

124
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,664
needs to use and how to use it.

125
00:08:00,164 --> 00:08:05,674
And this is how the actual flow would
look like between the user us LLM CCP

126
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:07,469
client server, and some external system.

127
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:11,899
So first, as I mentioned the
MCP server is responsible for

128
00:08:11,929 --> 00:08:13,609
adver advertising capabilities.

129
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:17,519
So this is essentially just
a handshake stage between MCP

130
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,349
client and MCP server over here.

131
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:20,249
So whenever.

132
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,040
MCV.

133
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,770
Whenever MCP client initialize connection
to MCV server, the server returns the

134
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,820
list of its available capabilities,
which are then later, as I mentioned,

135
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,499
attached to the prompt of, input to LLM.

136
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:38,969
Now, whenever we as user ask
something from LLM, so let's say

137
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:42,934
again we ask for the response time
for Google, LLM recognizes the

138
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:44,344
need functional external data.

139
00:08:44,404 --> 00:08:48,964
So in this case, it needs to
perform maybe pin command, right?

140
00:08:49,014 --> 00:08:50,304
Whenever a lamb.

141
00:08:50,484 --> 00:08:55,284
The decide that it needs access
for to more data, that it

142
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,754
needs to gather more context.

143
00:08:57,024 --> 00:09:01,714
It can request the use of MCP capabilities
and then well, there is of course

144
00:09:01,714 --> 00:09:03,474
also optional permission request.

145
00:09:04,254 --> 00:09:07,044
Although most of m, most of
MCP servers do not do this.

146
00:09:07,494 --> 00:09:08,514
Or MCP clients.

147
00:09:08,594 --> 00:09:14,434
Then MCP client, it provides to MCB server
which cap, which kind of capability.

148
00:09:14,464 --> 00:09:19,264
It wants the server to execute along
with some inputs if they are required.

149
00:09:20,045 --> 00:09:24,249
And then MCB server is actually
responsible for executing that tool call.

150
00:09:24,749 --> 00:09:30,030
Gathers the data and then this data is
returned in a formative way in a start,

151
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,430
in a standardized way back to LLM.

152
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,520
And then LLM hopefully can give us the
answer already right away, or maybe

153
00:09:37,574 --> 00:09:42,405
it can, decides to gather more context
through different tool and so on,

154
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:47,535
all the way until it gathers enough
information to give us contextualized

155
00:09:47,585 --> 00:09:49,115
answer to our initial query.

156
00:09:49,615 --> 00:09:52,675
And there are already quite a
lot of different MCP servers

157
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:54,745
available for you to use.

158
00:09:54,805 --> 00:10:00,055
So on the left this not, probably not
even the 1% of all the servers available.

159
00:10:00,444 --> 00:10:04,645
As you can see, they they're not only
about software systems, although you can

160
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:08,735
see for example, there, there is Grafana
there is Click House or CloudFlare.

161
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:13,775
So those MCP servers would allow
LLM to access those systems.

162
00:10:13,925 --> 00:10:17,724
But there are also, cPS for
tools outside of IT space?

163
00:10:18,214 --> 00:10:22,774
There is, for example, the one Thea,
which it is a search engine, but of

164
00:10:22,774 --> 00:10:28,044
course you can find MCP servers pretty
much for I would say almost anything.

165
00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:32,814
And there are a few marketplaces
or registries for MCP servers.

166
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:38,344
The first one, the initial one sort of
from Tropic contains quite a lot of,

167
00:10:38,444 --> 00:10:43,394
mCP servers for example, MCP servers,
as well as those which are in which

168
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:45,134
were initially implemented by tropic.

169
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:49,844
We at Quar also have our own
marketplace, and there are of course,

170
00:10:49,844 --> 00:10:55,504
also a lot of third party marketplaces
available for you to search for MCP.

171
00:10:56,004 --> 00:11:00,914
And here's an example of a few probably
the most helpful cps, which you might

172
00:11:01,314 --> 00:11:02,934
find useful in your everyday life.

173
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:07,890
Of course there is MCP to access
database to access databases.

174
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,630
So here's an example for Postgres.

175
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,120
But depending on what kind of
database you use internally,

176
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,500
you might prefer different.

177
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,370
Different MCP.

178
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:20,194
There is, there are of course servers, MCP
servers to access login systems, right?

179
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:25,340
So monitoring systems like Grafana,
for example, or sentri there is

180
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:29,230
tools or servers to access messaging
tools like Slack, for example.

181
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:34,710
Context seven is another helpful
MCP, which essentially allows LLM

182
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:39,345
to search for UpToDate documentation
for any library, for any framework.

183
00:11:39,845 --> 00:11:44,015
And there is also playwright, MCB, not
to be confused with playwright testing

184
00:11:44,015 --> 00:11:48,875
framework playwright, MCB server allows
LLM to essentially use the browser.

185
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:53,615
So it allows LLM to open the browser,
navigate to pages, click around

186
00:11:53,665 --> 00:11:55,465
fill fulfilling forms, and so on.

187
00:11:56,245 --> 00:12:00,505
And then LLM can later use that to
write, for example, end-to-end tests.

188
00:12:01,005 --> 00:12:06,415
Now if you don't find, the server,
which fits your needs you can of course

189
00:12:06,415 --> 00:12:08,665
quite easily create your own MCP server.

190
00:12:08,785 --> 00:12:13,115
And they there are SDKs available in
quite a lot of different languages.

191
00:12:13,545 --> 00:12:16,785
I think there is now even
probably around 11 or 12.

192
00:12:17,595 --> 00:12:18,135
Sdk.

193
00:12:18,135 --> 00:12:22,965
So languages available for SDKs, and as
you can see, of course it is available

194
00:12:22,965 --> 00:12:26,805
in the most popular languages like
Python tab script, Java, and so on.

195
00:12:26,925 --> 00:12:30,735
And you've seen an example
for MCP server, right?

196
00:12:30,735 --> 00:12:31,905
For the creative branch.

197
00:12:32,145 --> 00:12:33,345
It was actually in Go.

198
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,405
So you are not limited to
some specific language.

199
00:12:36,435 --> 00:12:41,805
You can create MCP servers in pretty much,
any language you are comfortable with.

200
00:12:42,565 --> 00:12:43,855
But here's an example on Python.

201
00:12:43,985 --> 00:12:49,935
So in order to convert any code
to MCP server in Python, you

202
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,905
need essentially just those
three lines I circled in orange.

203
00:12:54,055 --> 00:12:58,595
So of course we need to first
import library called Fast, MCP.

204
00:12:59,095 --> 00:13:01,855
Then we need to instantiate
the faster MCP server.

205
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:06,745
And then we just need to label
our function in this case for

206
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:11,255
execution batch commands with
this, the curator m CCP tool.

207
00:13:11,435 --> 00:13:12,755
And that's pretty much it, that.

208
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:18,140
So with just those three lines, we
converted our initial code for running

209
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,320
batch commands into MCP server.

210
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:26,740
And now any LLM compatible with MCP
can use this server to execute batch

211
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,690
commands on our local system now.

212
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,580
Let's actually see this in action.

213
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,260
I have a few practical examples to show
how it looks like in, in real life and

214
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:44,280
how MCP can extend the capabilities of LMS
beyond just output in the text for you.

215
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,610
So first one the most, probably
obvious one, is a combination

216
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,680
of Jira and Git and GitHub, MCP.

217
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,080
So through this combination.

218
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,380
You can essentially ask Lamb to
pull the contact from Jira Ticket,

219
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:02,130
solve it for you commit changes,
and then create a pull request.

220
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,570
And of course, if you are using not
Jira, but maybe linear or maybe not

221
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,140
GitHub, by GitLab, you can replace
the, those MC, those respective

222
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,440
MCP servers with something else.

223
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,530
But in my case, I will be shown
an example in this combination.

224
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:21,140
So let me switch my screen
over here to this code.

225
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,930
And over here I'll actually
already pre executed an example.

226
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,070
So inside encoder we have a native
integration of Jira, which essentially

227
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,230
allows you to just tag the ticket.

228
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,360
However, of course you can achieve
pretty much the same through JMCP,

229
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,805
although it wouldn't be as user friendly.

230
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,790
As native integration.

231
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,810
But basically here I'm taking the
ticket, asking the agent, let me zoom in

232
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:50,960
asking the agent to solve it, create a
branch push and create a pull request.

233
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,210
And it took the agent a bit of
time so it, navigated through the

234
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:59,750
repository, again, through different
tools, through different CP tools.

235
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,480
It has access not just to Jira,
Git and GitHub, but also it is,

236
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:09,230
provided with tools we serve as
part of encoder, so tools like grab

237
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,600
or maybe reading files and so on.

238
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,580
So it did a few, a bit of
exploration of the repository.

239
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,340
It found all the next three
files, which needs to be modified.

240
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,430
And it starts modifications.

241
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:28,770
So modifying the code, it, it ran some
batch commands to generate the open.

242
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,180
I open API schema.

243
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,360
And in the end let me
scroll all the way down.

244
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,060
So somewhere in the end, it
created the branch for us.

245
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,320
Let's see.

246
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,100
I don't see the, yeah, the
branch was created somewhere.

247
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,300
I think I missed it.

248
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,850
But basically it created a branch.

249
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:51,950
It created a commit, it pushed everything,
and then it used GitHub, MCP tools.

250
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,150
To create a pull request
for us over here and let me

251
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,680
actually show how it looks like.

252
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,155
So this is our pull request and
I would say it this probably.

253
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:06,375
One of the nicest looking
pull requests I've ever done.

254
00:16:06,595 --> 00:16:11,155
It was used my token, so it is authored
by me, but it basically made also

255
00:16:11,155 --> 00:16:15,835
changes in this case, quite a lot of
files 110 files it committed them.

256
00:16:16,405 --> 00:16:18,075
Created a nice description.

257
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:22,005
Again all the changes, how it
works pretty much everything.

258
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:27,125
And yeah, again, I would say with
probably one pull request I've ever done.

259
00:16:27,305 --> 00:16:33,045
And I guess it is nowadays the
sign of AI because, in this

260
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,845
day and age document PR, is.

261
00:16:35,345 --> 00:16:38,615
Apparently by thing because it
is most likely generated by ai.

262
00:16:39,245 --> 00:16:44,385
But jokes aside, asking LLM
to solve a ticket for you is a

263
00:16:44,385 --> 00:16:46,985
rather obvious example, right?

264
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:53,625
So let's go to the second one, which is a
bit more more not advanced, but a bit more

265
00:16:53,675 --> 00:16:55,735
going beyond just, solving the ticket.

266
00:16:56,275 --> 00:17:01,345
So we can actually give LLM access
to Kubernetes, so we can give it

267
00:17:01,345 --> 00:17:05,085
access to our Kubernetes cluster,
and then we can for example, ask

268
00:17:05,085 --> 00:17:08,885
it if there are any issues with the
pods with the deployments and so on.

269
00:17:09,185 --> 00:17:11,755
So let me actually switch
to my vs code over here.

270
00:17:12,255 --> 00:17:15,915
And again, I pre executed one example.

271
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:18,215
Let's see this one.

272
00:17:18,515 --> 00:17:22,125
So essentially here I'm asking are
there any pods in the specific name

273
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,225
space which are in non-healthy state?

274
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,430
So you can see LLM used the, that.

275
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:32,820
Specific tool for listing pods in name in
namespace from the Kubernetes MCP server.

276
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:40,020
And in this case the, there are apparently
no pods in unhealthy state, but of course

277
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:45,315
if there would be any you could then, for
example, ask LLM to fix the issue for you.

278
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,225
Maybe there is an issue in the code.

279
00:17:47,315 --> 00:17:51,855
Maybe there is an issue in the deployment,
but essentially given access to the

280
00:17:51,855 --> 00:17:56,975
Kubernetes to the Kubernetes cluster,
LLM can then help you either Deb back

281
00:17:56,975 --> 00:18:01,455
something without you needing to copy,
paste the errors or anything else.

282
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,045
Essentially, LLM can adjust.

283
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,300
Do that for you.

284
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,540
It can just go to the cluster, check
the logs, check the events see what

285
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,720
are the states of the posts and so on.

286
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,050
Then use that information to give
you better better answers, more

287
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:21,180
relevant answers, and help you
further improve your productivity.

288
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,440
But of course, now with a great
power comes great responsibility.

289
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:31,160
And while MCP is great for extending
capabilities of our lambs beyond

290
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:37,140
just output and text MCP servers
also do make with a lot of issues,

291
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:41,090
security issues and backdoors and
you be doors and no authentication

292
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,300
is just scratching the surface here.

293
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:49,240
But I prefer to split those security
issues into two kinda main categories.

294
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:54,220
First of all, of course, as I was
shown previously, MCP servers are

295
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,330
essentially code which you run on
your server or on your local machine.

296
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,750
Which means that whenever you are using.

297
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:07,190
Any third party third party MCP
server, it is essentially you

298
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,290
running any third party code.

299
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,750
And of course the usual suspects when
it comes to executing third party code

300
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,860
on your machine, on your server are,
the typical stuff which you might,

301
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,210
already be protecting from, right?

302
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:23,750
So it can be packaged and hijacking,
it can be executing malicious

303
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:28,065
code because you are essentially
executing the code that could be

304
00:19:28,115 --> 00:19:29,585
supply chain attacks and so on.

305
00:19:30,015 --> 00:19:36,345
So in this category of attacks, there is
no really specificity to MCP or to ai.

306
00:19:36,805 --> 00:19:41,815
It is essentially general attacks based
on execution, third party libraries

307
00:19:41,905 --> 00:19:45,265
and all the tools which you might
already use to protect from that.

308
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,465
So maybe some study static code
analysis or something similar.

309
00:19:48,825 --> 00:19:51,085
They are already helpful.

310
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,380
When it comes to MCP, however
with MCP, there is another

311
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,490
player which is essentially ai.

312
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,180
And there are of course a lot of
attacks or which are based on sort

313
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,850
of social engineering for ai and.

314
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:09,590
All of those attacks, in a sense, can
be classified as prompt injection.

315
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,870
But they have their own sort
of twist when it comes to MCP.

316
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,500
But of course, still prompt injection
itself is one of the most prominent

317
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,340
way ways to attack AI systems.

318
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:27,160
And prompt rejection means that
essentially, the perpetrator injects

319
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,520
a special string into the prompt,
into your initial prompt as a user.

320
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,690
And then this prompt is is
essentially hijacking the LLM

321
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,430
and making it do something else.

322
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:45,940
So let's say you as a user ask LLM about
the weather somewhere but then attacker.

323
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:51,670
Adds some specific lines of, specific
line of lines of text and it makes

324
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:55,950
LLM instead of answering you about the
weather, it makes LLM do something else.

325
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,570
Maybe create a file on your
system or maybe just output

326
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,250
some text about something else.

327
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,710
So that's prompt rejection.

328
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,890
And of course through MCP you can inject
it in different ways, but there are

329
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,620
also attacks which are MCP specific.

330
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:14,190
So of course you can potential the
attacker potentially can poison

331
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:18,590
the tool, meaning that the code,
which is being executed whenever

332
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,580
the tool is called can be malicious.

333
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,320
It may, it might be doing something
else, not what advertised by the tool.

334
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,300
There are also attacks
based on tool shadowing.

335
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:33,220
So essentially let's say a malicious
MCP server creates a tool which

336
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:38,630
is called the same as, or maybe
similar to to the benign server.

337
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:39,840
And then.

338
00:21:39,945 --> 00:21:44,545
AI might decide or speak, client
might decide to use this shadowed

339
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:50,625
malicious tool just because the name
is similar or the same and hence goes

340
00:21:50,725 --> 00:21:52,675
unnecessary execution of malicious code.

341
00:21:53,635 --> 00:21:58,275
Then of course MCP through MCP source,
you can actually execute code as well.

342
00:21:58,725 --> 00:22:02,295
There is a way to essentially ask AI.

343
00:22:02,925 --> 00:22:04,785
To just simply execute the malicious code.

344
00:22:04,785 --> 00:22:08,825
You don't even need to modify the
MCP server CP, the code MCP server.

345
00:22:08,825 --> 00:22:13,565
Somehow AI can essentially execute
malicious code for you through MCP.

346
00:22:14,065 --> 00:22:18,075
Now let me show a quick example
of how the prompt objection can

347
00:22:18,155 --> 00:22:22,505
hijack your LLM through the use
of a few cps, a few simple cps.

348
00:22:22,505 --> 00:22:25,495
So let me switch to my notebook over here.

349
00:22:25,555 --> 00:22:27,445
Let me remove all this.

350
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:33,875
And what I have here is a simple
MCP client which is, in this

351
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:36,220
case using a closed, so 4.5.

352
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,650
And execute this.

353
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,110
It is simple MCP client.

354
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:42,440
It gets a few tools at this disposal.

355
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,110
So there are 3M CP servers.

356
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,850
First one is for accessing a file
system so it can read files, it can

357
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:52,010
write files, move files, and so on.

358
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,600
There is a MCP server for fetching
web pages, and then there is MCP

359
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,520
server for executing batch commands.

360
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:04,500
So on top of that, I also have
right now locally a simple web

361
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,810
server, which looks pretty much
safe for us for human eye, right?

362
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,470
And as a name suggest it is actually safe.

363
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,780
I have another page, which is called
Not Oops, which again looks the same.

364
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:23,870
And I have a third page
called Oops, which is.

365
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:30,030
Again, looks the same for humans,
but let's ask our LLM to fe the

366
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:35,340
content of those three pages and
observe how it look, how it behaves.

367
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:40,640
So every time I ask to our LLM,
our son is 4.5 to fe the content

368
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,490
of the page and then say hi to us.

369
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:46,780
So let's see what happens
with our regular page?

370
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,170
As expected, it fetched the content.

371
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,010
The content looks pretty
much like what we saw, right?

372
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,380
And then well the LLM says
hi to us as instructed.

373
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,010
Now the second page, not
oops, is a bit tricky.

374
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,560
Because even though of course LLM
providers, they try to protect

375
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:10,860
from interjections still, not all
attacks can be successfully detected.

376
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:16,560
Actually, I think on Tropic several months
ago reported that they detect up to 88% of

377
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:22,350
prompt injection attacks, but this still
leaves 12% of attacks and not detected.

378
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,360
So this page not, oops.

379
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,320
Sometimes it's actually hijacks LLM.

380
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,370
Sometimes it doesn't.

381
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:32,780
So let's see if it will hijack
the LLM in this case, in this run.

382
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,220
But essentially, as you can see, the.

383
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,330
In addition to what we've
seen on the page, right?

384
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,900
So the hello world this
is my simple webpage text.

385
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:46,570
It actually also had an extra instruction,
which was hidden from human eye, but

386
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,100
it was fetched through fetch MCP tool.

387
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,530
Now in this case the agents hi to us.

388
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:58,845
It also noticed that the code block but it
decided not to follow instructions because

389
00:24:58,845 --> 00:25:00,860
it appears to be potentially malicious.

390
00:25:01,465 --> 00:25:05,065
There could be like security vulnerability
and so on, similar to prompt injection.

391
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:10,255
So in this case the prompt injection
detection worked on the tropic side.

392
00:25:10,285 --> 00:25:14,275
And LLM actually refused
to do anything else.

393
00:25:14,335 --> 00:25:20,335
And in this case, we asked the LLM to also
create a file called, oops six, oops, 60.

394
00:25:20,835 --> 00:25:26,405
Now let's try our third page and see
how our LLM will behave In this case

395
00:25:26,685 --> 00:25:29,145
as you remember, it was for human eye.

396
00:25:29,145 --> 00:25:30,615
It was the same context.

397
00:25:31,005 --> 00:25:36,975
However, there is actually extra
data added to the page and as

398
00:25:36,975 --> 00:25:40,755
you can see in this case, okay,
let's see what's going on there.

399
00:25:41,255 --> 00:25:41,405
Okay.

400
00:25:41,405 --> 00:25:43,295
It looks like there is
some issue with Tropic.

401
00:25:43,385 --> 00:25:47,315
Let's, let me try to run this.

402
00:25:47,765 --> 00:25:51,005
Hopefully tropic will be back up.

403
00:25:51,505 --> 00:25:51,535
Okay.

404
00:25:52,035 --> 00:25:55,855
But yeah, wireless execution, basically,
as you can see in this case it is

405
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:57,985
a bit more elaborate instructions.

406
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:02,755
So we are asking LLM to list
every function it has access to,

407
00:26:03,085 --> 00:26:08,445
which in sa in itself it is not
really a malicious intent, right?

408
00:26:08,865 --> 00:26:11,115
But then on top of that, we actually also.

409
00:26:11,615 --> 00:26:16,485
Telling LM that we have a new
function, which is basically writing

410
00:26:16,545 --> 00:26:23,435
a phrase into the file and then we
asking it to test it by cus this

411
00:26:23,435 --> 00:26:25,680
function and simulate the output.

412
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,500
As if it was a real function.

413
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,370
Now, as you can see, it took quite
a long time for LLM to respond,

414
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,735
and surely enough, first of all,
it set high as instructed, but then

415
00:26:35,735 --> 00:26:39,755
on top of that it actually started
listing all the available functions.

416
00:26:40,255 --> 00:26:42,745
It's actually quite a lot
of functions, 17 functions.

417
00:26:43,045 --> 00:26:47,665
But then what is more, when we
asked to test mock function,

418
00:26:48,205 --> 00:26:49,955
it actually didn't just.

419
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,530
Simulate the output.

420
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:56,510
It actually ran a right file
tool and created a tech txt

421
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,340
file on our local machine.

422
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,960
Let me actually show it.

423
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:07,155
So it was created 49 seconds ago,
and surely enough, essentially LLM

424
00:27:07,215 --> 00:27:12,705
was hijacked and potentially this
could lead to LM either executing

425
00:27:12,705 --> 00:27:14,745
some malicious code or maybe.

426
00:27:15,395 --> 00:27:17,735
Still in some files, still
in some data, and so on.

427
00:27:18,235 --> 00:27:24,535
As you can see it was still quite
easy to attack an LLM, but again,

428
00:27:24,535 --> 00:27:27,715
for the human eye, the page
looked pretty much safe, right?

429
00:27:27,715 --> 00:27:31,145
So it only for human eye only
had these these two lines

430
00:27:31,145 --> 00:27:32,635
of code written on the page.

431
00:27:33,135 --> 00:27:37,695
Now, if you want to play
with this notebook, here's a.

432
00:27:38,195 --> 00:27:38,465
Sorry.

433
00:27:38,915 --> 00:27:42,635
Here's the cure code, where you can find
that code, that notebook, and you can

434
00:27:42,635 --> 00:27:45,345
play around with it on your own free time.

435
00:27:45,845 --> 00:27:50,785
That as you've seen technically the
MCP itself in my example, was not

436
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:53,585
responsible for the actual attack, right?

437
00:27:53,585 --> 00:27:58,565
So it just fetched the page and
the actual attack was, execute

438
00:27:58,965 --> 00:28:00,585
through the context of the page.

439
00:28:01,005 --> 00:28:03,315
MCP itself didn't do anything wrong.

440
00:28:03,345 --> 00:28:05,845
It did exactly what it was created to do.

441
00:28:06,205 --> 00:28:11,705
And this is actually how one of the recent
attacks on GitHub MCP, it was executed.

442
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:16,115
So you might have heard about this
essentially again, in this case.

443
00:28:16,545 --> 00:28:20,655
MCP on its own was not
responsible for this exploit.

444
00:28:20,995 --> 00:28:21,025
Okay.

445
00:28:21,685 --> 00:28:26,895
What they did in this case is they
essentially just created a issue in

446
00:28:26,895 --> 00:28:31,585
the public repository saying that
the author is not widely recognized.

447
00:28:32,575 --> 00:28:37,835
And then they just asked LLM to go
through all the private repositories,

448
00:28:37,835 --> 00:28:43,075
collect information, and then add this
information to this public repository.

449
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:45,055
And then LLM give.

450
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,850
Being given access to GitHub MCP,
it did pretty much what it was

451
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,120
asked to do because 'cause why not?

452
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,360
It was asked to gather information.

453
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:00,900
It did this because it was given the
tools to do this, and then it essentially

454
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,820
just leaked, private information into
the public space, and again, technically

455
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,530
MCP itself, I have MCP itself is.

456
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:15,130
Is not the tool at fault here it
is the way AI is behaving or the

457
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:21,480
way AI agents are behaving that is
responsible for this exploit Now.

458
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:24,080
What are the ways to
protect your organization?

459
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,260
First of all, of course you
might want to wide list cps.

460
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,890
So you might want to define
which MCPS you actually want.

461
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:39,060
To allow your developers to use, or, your
LLM to use, you might want to consider

462
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:43,180
organization wide MCB Confis which
means that you can control permissions.

463
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:47,050
So it could be some redundant flags,
it could be some specific set of

464
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:51,490
tools which are allowed to be used
of from this MCP server and so on.

465
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,940
And of course, some MCP
servers require tokens.

466
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,760
So let's say GitHub, MCP,
of course, requires GitHub.

467
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:02,030
Personal access token to be able to
access GitHub, and you might want

468
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:06,620
to, somehow safely and securely
store them in your preferred system.

469
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:11,960
You might also want to limit access to
sensitive systems, which means maybe

470
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:14,810
not give access to production databases.

471
00:30:15,245 --> 00:30:19,035
To LLM or maybe at least not
access to those databases.

472
00:30:19,725 --> 00:30:23,055
And you might also want to limit
server or tool permissions.

473
00:30:23,145 --> 00:30:27,895
Again, readonly is one example,
but actually in Kubernetes,

474
00:30:27,925 --> 00:30:29,935
CCP is a good example of that.

475
00:30:29,965 --> 00:30:34,445
So they provide two flex as
part of their MCP server.

476
00:30:34,775 --> 00:30:37,325
One is to enable return the tools.

477
00:30:38,265 --> 00:30:43,280
And then the second one is to
disable destructive so that LLM will

478
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,880
not accidentally or not delete the
cluster or do some modifications

479
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,900
to the cluster and so on.

480
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,580
And then specifically for the prompt
ejection detection prevention, as

481
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:58,930
I mentioned most of, all of the,
large labs which provide LLMs like

482
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,340
open air and tropic and so on.

483
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:06,390
They, of course work on securing and
preventing from injection attacks.

484
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:10,120
Although again, of course you
can't protect from anything.

485
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,470
If you are worried about.

486
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:17,800
L lamps ingesting some harmful data
you might want to consider to use

487
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,480
some sort of intermediary tool.

488
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:23,450
So again, in case of ingesting webpages,
for example, specifically like I've

489
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:29,230
shown before, you might want to consider
using some proxy that doesn't just

490
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:33,770
ingest webpage and pass it as is to LLM.

491
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:37,700
You might want to use some
sort of ai, web search, right?

492
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,100
SOA or perplexity for example.

493
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:43,360
'cause they on top of just
ingesting the web pages.

494
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,100
They also do some summarization.

495
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,480
They also do some protection and so on.

496
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:53,480
So you might want to essentially use
these sort of proxy tools before actually

497
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:59,590
dumping the data into the LLM leading
to potentially harmful consequences.

498
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:03,060
And with that that's all for me.

499
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,830
So if you want to try out Sun Code,
you can use this secure code over

500
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:11,170
here on the, I guess on your left.

501
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,400
And then if you want to
connect with me over here.

502
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,690
You'll find all my socials
LinkedIn and so on.

503
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:24,050
And thank you all for attention and I
hope you have a good day ahead of you.
