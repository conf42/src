1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,150
Hello everyone, and thank
you for joining my session.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:04,800
My name is Raju Shari.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,550
I'm a senior cloud and ML lops
engineer with over 10 years of

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,240
experience building large scale
cloud and machine learning systems.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,960
Currently at Freddie Mac, I'm
a senior cloud developer on the

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,130
enterprise data science platform.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,450
Today I'm talking about scaling ML
mops with self service platforms.

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,300
Here's a roadmap for my talk today.

9
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:24,440
First.

10
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:28,205
We'll look at the evolution of ML
operations, like how organizations

11
00:00:28,205 --> 00:00:32,525
move from satellite experiments to
enterprise grade production systems.

12
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:37,465
Second, I've introduced the cell service
platform architecture and it's key

13
00:00:37,465 --> 00:00:42,025
components, integration patterns, and the
go governance models that supports it.

14
00:00:42,955 --> 00:00:47,620
Third, we will discuss a measured impact
and implementation roadmap, including case

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,255
studies, metrics, actionable steps for
organizations that want to get started.

16
00:00:52,755 --> 00:00:57,495
Finally, I will share future trends and
strategic positioning, things like auto

17
00:00:57,495 --> 00:01:01,725
ml, serverless ml, and premise, which
will reshape how financial services

18
00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:03,915
approach ML ops in the coming years.

19
00:01:04,545 --> 00:01:08,565
So by the end of the session, you should
have a clear understanding of how cell

20
00:01:08,565 --> 00:01:13,815
service platforms can drive efficiency,
governance, and innovation all at once.

21
00:01:14,315 --> 00:01:16,115
Let's begin with MLS maturity shift.

22
00:01:16,615 --> 00:01:18,954
In the financial industry,
human operations has gone

23
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,274
through a big transformation.

24
00:01:20,904 --> 00:01:23,064
We started with solid experiments.

25
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:27,384
Teams build models in isolation, often
method without path to production.

26
00:01:27,895 --> 00:01:31,854
Deployments are manual,
slow, error prone, and how to

27
00:01:31,854 --> 00:01:34,585
reproduce later are inconsistent.

28
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:35,724
Water worked.

29
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:37,585
One laptop might fail in production.

30
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:41,784
The governance was aocc with the
little oversight of traceability.

31
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:44,574
Overall, rever disability was limited.

32
00:01:45,354 --> 00:01:48,704
Making it hot to scale or meet
regulatory requirements over

33
00:01:48,704 --> 00:01:52,604
time, this evolved into integrated
platforms that generalize the pool.

34
00:01:52,664 --> 00:01:53,505
MLI cycle.

35
00:01:54,255 --> 00:01:57,734
These platforms bring consistency,
automation, and governance

36
00:01:58,124 --> 00:01:59,294
while assuring compliance.

37
00:02:00,164 --> 00:02:02,774
This shift from acceleration
to integrated platforms.

38
00:02:03,285 --> 00:02:07,215
Is it hot OPT task scaling ML mops
in banking and financial services?

39
00:02:07,715 --> 00:02:12,845
Now that we've seen how ML operations
was involved, evolved, let's talk about

40
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,315
why self service platform matters.

41
00:02:14,815 --> 00:02:17,905
You see there is 71 point percent
duction in the data preparation time

42
00:02:18,445 --> 00:02:22,765
because platforms provide standardized
pipelines and reusable components.

43
00:02:22,765 --> 00:02:27,535
A 40%, 40% duction in training
cost by optimizing compute.

44
00:02:27,804 --> 00:02:28,829
So the workload run on their.

45
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:34,340
Instead of wasting resources like
GPU and CPU 8 38 30 8% improvement

46
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,930
in deployment success with indicated
CACD pipelines and enrollments.

47
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:42,950
But beyond the numbers,
platforms transform.

48
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,579
All financial institutions
manage ML risk and compliance.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,570
They enable force innovation while
maintaining strict regulatory standards.

50
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,850
Now look at the code
platform architecture.

51
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,920
Strong architecture is the foundation
for organizational ml at scale.

52
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,030
It ensure the platform is
stable, secure, and compliant.

53
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,465
While supporting the MLI cycle
and meeting the regulatory needs,

54
00:03:04,965 --> 00:03:06,225
the architecture has three layers.

55
00:03:06,705 --> 00:03:08,415
The first one is
foundation infrastructure.

56
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:09,555
Its scalable.

57
00:03:09,765 --> 00:03:10,905
CPUs and G Bs.

58
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:16,845
Resilient shortage and secure networking
organization must decide whether to

59
00:03:16,845 --> 00:03:19,425
go cloud or on-premises or hybrid.

60
00:03:20,425 --> 00:03:23,415
Here Kubernetes key role
in standardization while

61
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:26,055
strong data securities,
essentially related industries.

62
00:03:26,745 --> 00:03:29,145
The second one is data and
feature engineer management.

63
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:33,375
Unified environment for data
envision, processing, validation,

64
00:03:33,705 --> 00:03:35,265
versioning, and incentive feature.

65
00:03:35,265 --> 00:03:38,130
Short the feature short, ensure
consistency and reasonability

66
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,190
while keeping everything auditable.

67
00:03:41,029 --> 00:03:42,589
The third ml lifecycle management.

68
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,670
This covers fermentation,
draining, versioning, deployment,

69
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,929
and continuous monitoring.

70
00:03:48,649 --> 00:03:52,280
It includes C, D pipelines,
registries, testing, and observability.

71
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,150
Ensuring models are high
performing and compliant.

72
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,580
So in short, provides the power data,
provides a foundation and lifecycle

73
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:02,739
ensures governance and control.

74
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,680
Now let's put the piece together
and work at the different

75
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:07,770
architecture in financial services.

76
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,129
A platform like this crucial,
it helps tax in complexity.

77
00:04:11,565 --> 00:04:13,965
So data scientist can focus on
models, ensure provisioning,

78
00:04:13,965 --> 00:04:15,885
compute, networking, or storage.

79
00:04:16,575 --> 00:04:21,164
So at the same point, it's built by
compliance Andro the street controls,

80
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:26,055
generates audit trials or in an inch
and deployment and ensure separation

81
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:29,685
of duties between developers,
operators, and compliance teams.

82
00:04:30,615 --> 00:04:34,784
So when regulator ask how this
model client, who approved it,

83
00:04:34,995 --> 00:04:37,095
my data was used, when was it?

84
00:04:37,395 --> 00:04:38,145
Is it updated?

85
00:04:38,865 --> 00:04:44,235
The platform provides answer answers in
gently, so in stock, achi and operations

86
00:04:44,235 --> 00:04:46,635
for ensuring security and compliance.

87
00:04:47,135 --> 00:04:50,025
Now, let look the key components here.

88
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:50,925
There are four pillars.

89
00:04:51,735 --> 00:04:56,390
First, content or situation
ban schedules, ML workforce,

90
00:04:56,869 --> 00:04:58,270
customer resources behind jobs.

91
00:04:58,489 --> 00:05:00,390
So they CanBan consistently
across environments.

92
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,530
Scalability and isolation
in multitenant setup.

93
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,660
The second here is distributed compute,
spa and DOS handle lodge scale data.

94
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,130
They provide parallel computing and
lineage tracking, so every transformation

95
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,410
can be traced, which regulators demand.

96
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,870
The third, the model registry and
artifact stored all time models have with

97
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,250
compliance metadata, who trained them when
data was used and when they were uploaded.

98
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,450
So prevent UN from going live and.

99
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,560
CRYPTOGRAPHICS checks ensure
models are not tampered with the

100
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,570
fourth CICD integration here.

101
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,990
Automated pipelines run test
security scans and approval

102
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,640
gates before deployment.

103
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,180
This enables post consistent
and complete releases.

104
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,860
Together these four pillars make
platforms scalable, secure, and auditable.

105
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,620
Let's talk about governance layer.

106
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,530
So up to this point, we
talked about infras compute.

107
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:54,940
Pipelines.

108
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,730
The final layer that ties
everything together is governance.

109
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,760
So without governance platforms,
these regulated industries

110
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,930
simply cannot succeed.

111
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,460
So it has three parts.

112
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,020
The first automated policy
enforcement, the platform enforces

113
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:13,450
access controls at runtime, respect,
model limits, and applies security.

114
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,110
Security consistently.

115
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,620
Even if a data scientist config
misconfigured something, the

116
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,600
platform prevent compliance issues.

117
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,300
Second, compliance documentation.

118
00:06:23,065 --> 00:06:26,095
Model course lineage diagrams
and validation reports were

119
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:27,235
generated automatically.

120
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:29,065
Instead of manual documentation.

121
00:06:29,545 --> 00:06:33,025
Evidence is corrected in real time
as part of third audit observability.

122
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:37,125
The platform capture, lack
logs, monitoring data and

123
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,205
explainability outputs.

124
00:06:38,655 --> 00:06:41,955
If a regulator ask, why did
this model make a decision?

125
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:44,295
The platform provides
explainability immediately.

126
00:06:45,015 --> 00:06:45,555
The takeaway.

127
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,075
The governments must be built in
front of the stock, not voted on.

128
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:49,465
Later

129
00:06:49,965 --> 00:06:52,955
here, self service experience,
developer view, the goal is

130
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:55,955
freedom to innovate quickly, but
within the compliance boundaries.

131
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:57,530
This can be shared in two ways.

132
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,810
First, AB obsession with control.

133
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,930
Developers use curated
environments with pre-approved

134
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,610
packages, so they avoid setup.

135
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,590
The award setup delays, security risk.

136
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,120
So templates given consistency
across team for more, more flexible

137
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,160
team allows custom environments
without breaking guard guidelines.

138
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,490
Second, seen as that flow with one click.

139
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,730
Developers deploy models into staging
complaints, check and documentation,

140
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,520
and automatically integrated
packing and monitoring health

141
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,890
track performance issues between.

142
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,040
For developers, the platform
feed simple brand cost.

143
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,855
Behind the scenes it enforces
governance, compliance, and security.

144
00:07:32,355 --> 00:07:34,035
Now we talk about building versus buying.

145
00:07:34,535 --> 00:07:37,885
One of the most important question
here is it should we build the platform

146
00:07:37,885 --> 00:07:39,655
ourself or by a commercial solution?

147
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:41,245
There are three options here.

148
00:07:41,515 --> 00:07:45,505
First, in our development offers
full customization and integration

149
00:07:45,505 --> 00:07:49,035
with legacy systems, but it usually
takes 12 to 18 months and the query

150
00:07:49,155 --> 00:07:53,505
requires a team of specialized
engineers, second commercial platforms.

151
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:54,515
Faster time.

152
00:07:54,635 --> 00:07:58,085
Faster time to value, usually three
to six months, and we include building

153
00:07:58,085 --> 00:08:01,535
complaints, but you make force
vendor LOCKIN integration challenges.

154
00:08:02,135 --> 00:08:03,395
Third, the hybrid approach.

155
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:07,175
Take a vendor code for speed, then
add even one governance integration.

156
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,545
These feature reach tion
in six to nine months.

157
00:08:10,265 --> 00:08:13,235
For most financial organization, the
hybrid approach is the best balance of

158
00:08:13,235 --> 00:08:15,485
speed, customization and complaints.

159
00:08:15,985 --> 00:08:17,365
Let's talk about future of mops.

160
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:21,735
Strong foundations will sell highly
platforms, governance, automation, but the

161
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:24,255
architectures of the feature go further.

162
00:08:25,245 --> 00:08:28,995
It involves HML most workload
closer to data sources.

163
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:33,465
It reduces ency improving privacy
and cutting cost for fraud detection

164
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,265
and trading makes a big difference.

165
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,934
Enterprise ml, it enables automated
model selection and tuning.

166
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:42,459
Its explainability built in so
business users can build models safely.

167
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,260
Serverless trainings, we shift to
event driven paper use models, making

168
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,310
process simpler and cost efficient
while keeping governance intact.

169
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:57,490
Privacy, preserving ml, its uses federated
learning and encryption to train across

170
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,860
silos without exposing sensitive data.

171
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,420
Today's architecture choices should
prepare us per this edge, native,

172
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,209
automated, and privacy first future.

173
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:08,449
We talk about engineer architecture.

174
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:11,709
Traditionally, ML and finance
has been cloud-based, centralized

175
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:13,209
training and inference.

176
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:17,499
It works, but introduce latency and
require more into data to be to the cloud.

177
00:09:18,219 --> 00:09:21,939
The next step is hybrid training
in the cloud inference at the edge,

178
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:25,449
this registers latency for realtime
use cases while keeping scalability.

179
00:09:25,989 --> 00:09:27,399
The ultimate stage is edge.

180
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,849
Need two ml training across distributed
devices with the Feder learning.

181
00:09:31,524 --> 00:09:36,644
Running models directly on device,
discuss dis discuss latency by up to 40%.

182
00:09:36,734 --> 00:09:37,064
And hand.

183
00:09:37,064 --> 00:09:37,904
Hand has privacy.

184
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:39,944
Since data never lease its source.

185
00:09:40,604 --> 00:09:42,134
The future will be hybrid and Azure.

186
00:09:42,134 --> 00:09:42,434
A two.

187
00:09:42,974 --> 00:09:45,344
Combining cloud scale
and edge responsiveness.

188
00:09:45,844 --> 00:09:47,224
Let's talk about emerging trends.

189
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:52,654
Financial ML ops first enterprise
auto ML Automation with guard rails,

190
00:09:52,894 --> 00:09:54,619
automatic model selection, hyper tuning.

191
00:09:55,204 --> 00:09:58,084
But with explainability so
regulators can audit out outputs.

192
00:09:58,654 --> 00:10:04,164
Second serverless PY is event driven
paper computation ml that emulates heavy

193
00:10:04,164 --> 00:10:08,634
infrastructure while still enforcing
governance code privacy, preserving ml.

194
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:12,834
Its use ED learning and encryption to
PY models without exposing sensor data.

195
00:10:13,524 --> 00:10:18,354
This enables collaboration with while
maintaining privacy together auto ML for

196
00:10:18,354 --> 00:10:22,044
speed, serverless efficiency, privacy,
preserving ML for complaints, create

197
00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:24,084
a blueprint of next generation ML ops.

198
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:25,314
Here are the four.

199
00:10:25,704 --> 00:10:26,914
Here are key takeaways.

200
00:10:27,324 --> 00:10:29,669
First, platforms are so essential.

201
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:33,449
Scaling M Financial services
without them is not illustrate.

202
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,979
Second, governance must be and build
from the start, not added later.

203
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,859
Third, start at the
minimum viable platform.

204
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:43,289
Focus on the first restriction
areas, then expand.

205
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:44,129
And fourth.

206
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:48,614
Plan, the feature's edition
will shape how Ready we are.

207
00:10:48,674 --> 00:10:54,394
Edge Auto ML and privacy reserving
ml. Here's 90 Day Roadmap one.

208
00:10:55,024 --> 00:10:56,584
All ML workflows and complaints.

209
00:10:56,584 --> 00:10:59,555
Gap design requirements in
both technical AGGREGATORY

210
00:10:59,555 --> 00:11:02,314
teams prototype the small team.

211
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:06,514
It's usually have to do three
points, deliver an MB, focus on high

212
00:11:06,514 --> 00:11:10,864
friction areas and measure success
with KPAs like deployment time, donor

213
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:13,084
efficiency, and level of satisfaction.

214
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:17,425
So by calling these steps, organization
can move from foundation to enterprise

215
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:19,555
grade ML in a structured way.

216
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:20,564
And that's it.

217
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:22,305
I will bring this session to close.

218
00:11:22,484 --> 00:11:23,564
Thank you so much for your time.
