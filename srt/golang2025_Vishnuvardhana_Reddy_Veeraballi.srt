1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,710
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:02,970
My name is Vishnu.

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:08,000
I am here with you today to discuss
about cloud security for shared

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,060
management, commonly known as CSPM.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,880
As more organizations move their
applications to cloud, maintaining a

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,779
strong security P is crucial to protecting
sensitive data and ensuring compliance.

7
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:28,314
In this session, I will be
sharing insight into how.

8
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:36,400
CSPM can help you identify risks,
enforcing, enforce security policies,

9
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,070
and strengthen your cloud environment.

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,520
CSPM provides automated security
monitoring, compliance management,

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,210
and risk assessment across multiple
cloud platforms like, Amazon Web

12
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:57,260
Services AWS, Microsoft Azure and
GCP and other cloud platforms.

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,030
Yeah.

14
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,250
CSPM, core concepts and
growing importance to CSPM.

15
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:05,370
What is, CSPM?

16
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:11,529
CSPM, is a continuously monitoring
cloud infrastructure configurations.

17
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:17,529
And security settings to identify
potential vulnerabilities

18
00:01:17,589 --> 00:01:19,149
and compliance issues.

19
00:01:19,839 --> 00:01:25,960
This system establish baseline
security configurations and actively

20
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,490
monitored for deviations that
could indicate security risks.

21
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:36,250
CSPM critical, functionalities,
identifying, misconfiguration

22
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,360
in cloud service.

23
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,650
and continuously monitoring,
reporting and alerting.

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:49,919
Then, it provide comprehensive visibility
across cloud environments, market growth,

25
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:54,325
compound animal growth rate, with 12.8%.

26
00:01:54,825 --> 00:01:59,775
This growth is driven by raising
frequency of cloud security

27
00:01:59,775 --> 00:02:06,675
breaches and the increasing complex
complexity of multi-cloud environment

28
00:02:06,705 --> 00:02:10,935
within single organization,
technical architecture components.

29
00:02:11,535 --> 00:02:12,045
Mainly.

30
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:16,575
We have in c in CSPM three
components out there.

31
00:02:17,085 --> 00:02:18,095
One is, continuous.

32
00:02:18,725 --> 00:02:25,455
Monitoring systems, risk assessment
frameworks, compliance monitoring tools.

33
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:30,845
when coming to the continuous
monitoring systems, we can build

34
00:02:30,935 --> 00:02:32,915
our own monitoring systems or.

35
00:02:33,415 --> 00:02:40,765
We can, utilize the vendors, vendors
or SaaS providers like, Okta with

36
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:46,725
Ivo Rapid seven, multiple SaaS
vendors or cloud service provider.

37
00:02:46,845 --> 00:02:51,415
Also providing, CSPM
solution mainly we can.

38
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:58,980
We can ingest data using a p CS
Cloud service providers APAs to get,

39
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:06,100
cloud environment metadata to, to
verify configurations and to protect,

40
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,180
organization or cloud service.

41
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,810
This one, will give you, visibility
across the cloud infrastructure.

42
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:20,070
So second, risk assessment frameworks,
is automated scanning assessment

43
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,810
capabilities, identifying potential
security gaps and compliance

44
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,970
violations across cloud, workloads,
security frameworks, like CAS

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,570
benchmarks, for industry standards.

46
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,050
And, NIST frameworks failed ramp.

47
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:44,160
And when the best practices frameworks, we
can utilize, as a template to start, cloud

48
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,350
configuration, continuous monitoring.

49
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,950
Third one is compliance monitoring tools.

50
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,690
this component, works conjunction
with, security policy engines to

51
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:00,150
enforce organizational security
standards, enabling automated policy

52
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:06,180
enforcement and continuous compliance
monitoring across cloud environments.

53
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:06,860
Yeah.

54
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,540
implementation strategy?

55
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,249
Yeah.

56
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,355
First, we need to do inventory analysis.

57
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:20,034
Across all organization cloud assets
and resource, and, we can do what

58
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:25,405
qualitative analysis and quantitative
analysis, qualitative analysis like

59
00:04:25,405 --> 00:04:30,624
is, if we are using cloud service
for public facing applications.

60
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:35,619
We can give more priority and
the quantitative is based on

61
00:04:35,619 --> 00:04:39,429
number of resources for that
particular cloud service.

62
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:46,259
We can give priority, we can understand,
our inventory and we can define

63
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,479
scope of security coverage needed.

64
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:56,069
What is in scope and what is out scope
if you are using a third party sas?

65
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:00,479
Monitor CSPM tools, you need to consider.

66
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:03,529
what, how, what services they are.

67
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:05,689
They have coverage,
they have full coverage.

68
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:07,679
there are no coverage.

69
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:12,899
Particular cloud service, that same
services are we using in our organization.

70
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:18,419
Once, inventory, analysis is
done, then next step, security

71
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,629
baseline establishment.

72
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:26,039
In this one, we need, we can, we
can define, we can, we need to

73
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:32,699
do cloud configuration rules and
security controls in a framework

74
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:35,069
security configuration baseline.

75
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:39,349
here, using with the help of
industry based practices and

76
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:42,319
organizational security requirements.

77
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:43,059
Yeah.

78
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:49,009
in this one, some, cloud configurations
rules provided by vendor or industry

79
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:55,289
based practices frameworks may not,
applicable to our organization.

80
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:01,429
Based on our security requirements, we
need to adjust, those, default frameworks.

81
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:06,899
based on severity and risk.

82
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:07,699
Yeah.

83
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:12,239
next we can in once, security
configuration, baseline is established

84
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:17,459
and it's ongoing security monitoring
and complete compliance assessment,

85
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:24,029
then we can integrate with our existing
tools like sim systems and IAM tools.

86
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:28,309
it'll give you, comprehensive
coverage and cons, consistent

87
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:31,049
monitoring, next alert configurations.

88
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:34,109
Once, SA cloud security.

89
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:35,519
Cloud configuration.

90
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,369
Baseline rule is have some findings.

91
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:41,679
We need to, alert to security teams.

92
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:45,859
we can do some alert configurations
like, we can integrate with

93
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:47,599
the Jira or creating ticket.

94
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:53,159
And, based on, our national risk
tolerance, we can change the severity.

95
00:06:53,460 --> 00:07:00,220
and we can, we can ensuring effective
prior of security incidents, we can

96
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,669
customize, when that provided severity
for that, cloud configuration rules.

97
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:10,560
we can customize based on our,
organization security requirements.

98
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,360
Yeah.

99
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,890
integration requirements, cloud
service provider connections.

100
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,060
Yeah.

101
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,884
Establishing a PA connections with
the cloud service provider, ensures

102
00:07:21,884 --> 00:07:27,405
consistent data flow, and it'll give
usability across cloud environments.

103
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:33,620
This, appropriate access, control
and secure communication channels.

104
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,450
Yep.

105
00:07:34,515 --> 00:07:39,175
we can set up this, CSP
connections in two ways.

106
00:07:39,745 --> 00:07:44,975
One is, scanning, hourly basis,
like every 12 hours or 24 hours.

107
00:07:45,605 --> 00:07:51,105
Other one is near real time updates,
like cloud event, integration.

108
00:07:51,135 --> 00:07:52,455
Whenever some resource.

109
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:55,815
Configuration changes immediately.

110
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:00,195
update, edge Good Cloud
configuration rules.

111
00:08:00,225 --> 00:08:06,260
Update inventory and up edge good cloud
configuration rules of, identify any

112
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,740
misconfiguration deviation from baseline.

113
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,370
Next, security tool integration.

114
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,390
Connecting with existing
security tools and monitor.

115
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:22,180
Monitor monitoring systems enables
unified security management and

116
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,760
consistent policy enforcements.

117
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:30,150
This includes SIM systems, IM
tools, integrations, data connector

118
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:35,640
configurations, configuring appropriate
data connectors, and ensuring

119
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,340
proper data formatting for analysis.

120
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:44,730
It enables effective security monitoring
and assessment across cloud environments.

121
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:50,630
Security and compliance benefits
enhance security portion CSPM

122
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:55,310
solutions, provide continuous monitoring
and assessment cap capabilities.

123
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:01,830
it's enable organizations to identify
address security risks proactively before

124
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:08,490
they can be exploited automated security
policy enforcement as a major, as a

125
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:14,125
critical component of modern security
strategies compliance management.

126
00:09:14,385 --> 00:09:18,545
automated compliance monitoring
and reporting capabilities, enables

127
00:09:18,545 --> 00:09:24,365
organizations to maintain continuous
compliance with various regularity.

128
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:28,505
Frameworks like, CAS
benchmarks, niche framework.

129
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:34,580
fed Ramp and, it, this
simplifies audit process and

130
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,710
regulatory requirement tracking.

131
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:42,530
While ensuring accurate and timely
reporting operational efficiency,

132
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:49,095
it'll reduce manual intervention
with, automated, continuous,

133
00:09:49,195 --> 00:09:53,335
cloud environment scanning and
identify any misconfiguration.

134
00:09:53,595 --> 00:09:59,915
in CSPM solution implementation
best practices, so regular security

135
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:05,695
assessment, conduct, systematic
vulnerability, scannings and

136
00:10:06,175 --> 00:10:11,515
pen test to proactively identify
security gaps and compliance risks.

137
00:10:11,765 --> 00:10:14,545
define, robust IEM policies.

138
00:10:15,445 --> 00:10:21,235
Establish a principle of least
privileged access controls with the MFA

139
00:10:21,295 --> 00:10:28,455
to prevent unauthorized access to, to
send two resources like NPA data, PA

140
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:32,165
data, those, any sensitive resources.

141
00:10:32,415 --> 00:10:39,795
any trans, you can secure transaction
enable MFA, continuous monitoring, mon

142
00:10:39,795 --> 00:10:48,135
monitor, CSPM frameworks and deploy,
automate automated, monitoring for all

143
00:10:48,135 --> 00:10:50,625
cloud environments with real time alerts.

144
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:57,630
For any suspicious activities
and configuration changes, if,

145
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,910
we can continuously monitor, our
security configuration baseline.

146
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:09,100
If any unauthorized person changes,
our baseline, we need to identify

147
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,100
incident response planning.

148
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:18,250
create a detailed, untested response
playbook with a clear, escalation

149
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,880
pause on recovery procedure
for various security scenarios.

150
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,810
staff training programs.

151
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:28,030
it's a, it's a role based specific
security training with the simulated

152
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:32,825
phishing exercises and hands-on
workshop to build security awareness,

153
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:39,285
common challenges and solutions in
CSPM, like in liquid configuration

154
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:41,095
management, leading to.

155
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,630
Or exploitable vulnerabilities.

156
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:49,005
for this one, we can implement real
time configuration assessment with

157
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:51,645
the automated remediation workflows.

158
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:57,155
Compliance management, is dynamic
regulatory landscape evolving

159
00:11:57,655 --> 00:12:02,155
change, Whenever new cloud
service releases are utilized by

160
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:07,585
organization, we need to enhance
our security configuration baseline.

161
00:12:07,885 --> 00:12:13,170
Also resource management, established
role-based security training with the

162
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,785
with, sandbags cloud environment scenario.

163
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,420
With cloud.

164
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:17,810
Yeah.

165
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,760
Practical cloud environment
scenarios, integrations, implement

166
00:12:22,895 --> 00:12:26,720
a PA driven security architecture
with centralized management council.

167
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:27,370
Yeah.

168
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,480
Imagine technologists in
CSPM, artificial intelligence.

169
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:37,960
Yeah, you can, utilize, enable a
for threat, more threat detection

170
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,840
and automated response capabilities.

171
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:46,575
Advanced automation, we can
implement autom remediation, autom

172
00:12:46,575 --> 00:12:52,875
remediation workflows or playbooks
whenever misconfiguration finds.

173
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:58,610
we can, automatically fix, automatic
without manual intervention,

174
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:04,880
automatically update configuration to,
