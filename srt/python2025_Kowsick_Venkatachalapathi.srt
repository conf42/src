00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:00,770
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:05,770
Welcome to my talk on transforming
workflow automation, leveraging AI

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,230
and machine learning for enhanced
efficiency and digital decision making.

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,360
In this talk, we are going to explore
how these technologies are driving

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,810
efficiency, intelligent decision making
and adaptive process across the industry.

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:19,939
Let's get into it.

7
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:23,709
The evolution of workflow automation
from task to intelligence.

8
00:00:24,395 --> 00:00:28,755
we have the traditional automation,
and the now AI power automation.

9
00:00:29,584 --> 00:00:33,675
So the traditional automation, centered
on mechanically automating repeatability

10
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:38,584
tasks through the rigid and script
driven process, where, people, used

11
00:00:38,584 --> 00:00:41,785
to write Java, NET, the typical
software development, characterized

12
00:00:41,785 --> 00:00:46,075
by, manual configuration, predefined
workflows, and limited flexibilities.

13
00:00:46,995 --> 00:00:50,175
This system operate on static
rule-based logic with minimal

14
00:00:50,475 --> 00:00:51,765
contextual understanding.

15
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:58,985
So once it is set, every time there is, as
a change happens or a new, SOP, comes into

16
00:00:58,985 --> 00:01:02,965
the picture, somebody have to open the
code and then, change the configuration

17
00:01:03,235 --> 00:01:09,305
or rewrite the, the workflow, stages,
and then how to redeploy release the

18
00:01:09,305 --> 00:01:10,915
late, the next version of the software.

19
00:01:11,415 --> 00:01:14,625
Which is the type consuming
and expensive on the long run.

20
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,985
coming to the AI powered automation.

21
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:22,525
so the transcending, basic task execution,
AI driven, driven workflows leverage

22
00:01:22,575 --> 00:01:26,285
advanced machine learning algorithms
to dynamically analyze the complex

23
00:01:26,455 --> 00:01:30,755
data set, generate the intelligent
insight and, autonomously adopt to

24
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:33,385
evolving operational environments.

25
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,885
This sophisticated approach
enables continuous learning,

26
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:40,825
predictive optimization and
unprecedented operational efficiency.

27
00:01:41,325 --> 00:01:49,265
So in, in the, the world of, BPM and
C-M-N-D-M-N, the workflow stages are

28
00:01:49,835 --> 00:01:54,990
going to be driven by the data, and
create the task or create the approvals.

29
00:01:55,745 --> 00:02:01,315
based on, based on the data and the, the
ever changing, the business processes.

30
00:02:01,815 --> 00:02:05,635
So what is the benefit of the
AI driven, automation, approach,

31
00:02:05,665 --> 00:02:10,705
