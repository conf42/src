00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,420
Hello everyone, I'm thrilled to have
this opportunity to present on this

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:09,270
critical and exciting topic at the
Conf 42 DevSecOps 2024 conference.

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,309
Leveraging AI in fintech,
revolutionizing security, compliance

4
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:15,330
and automation in DevSecOps.

5
00:00:15,969 --> 00:00:19,140
Artificial intelligence is a game
changer in financial technology.

6
00:00:19,435 --> 00:00:22,935
enabling transformative changes
in areas like fraud detection,

7
00:00:22,985 --> 00:00:26,275
personalized financial services,
and regulatory compliance.

8
00:00:26,654 --> 00:00:29,845
so today we will discuss how these
technologies are reshaping the industry

9
00:00:29,865 --> 00:00:33,854
and dive into both the opportunities as
well as the challenges that they present.

10
00:00:34,385 --> 00:00:36,364
So before we begin, let
me introduce myself.

11
00:00:36,364 --> 00:00:37,714
So my name is Sudeep Meduri.

12
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:41,675
And I have had the privilege of working
closely with AI solutions in the fintech

13
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:43,355
domain for the past couple of years.

14
00:00:43,755 --> 00:00:47,005
So this session is mostly based on
my experience working in this field.

15
00:00:47,345 --> 00:00:48,205
let's, dive in.

16
00:00:48,705 --> 00:00:50,605
here is an outline of
what we'll cover today.

17
00:00:50,655 --> 00:00:54,065
so mostly we'll start with an introduction
to AI and fintech, where we set the

18
00:00:54,065 --> 00:00:57,725
stage by discussing why this topic
is so relevant and transformative.

19
00:00:58,165 --> 00:01:02,105
next we'll dive into key, applications
of AI, including fraud detection,

20
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,810
Personalized Banking Services, Algorithmic
Trading, and Regulatory Compliance.

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,430
We'll then explore the broader impact of
AI on FinTech, looking at how it drives

22
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,320
operational efficiency and innovation.

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,610
Following that, we'll examine the
challenges and ethical considerations,

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,930
including issues like data privacy, bias,
and workforce dynamics that it brings up.

25
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:27,685
Finally, we'll wrap up with the conclusion
and some actionable insights for

26
00:01:27,685 --> 00:01:29,575
leveraging AI responsibly in fintech.

27
00:01:30,335 --> 00:01:34,124
Let's begin with an overview
of AI's role in fintech.

28
00:01:34,624 --> 00:01:38,274
So right now, AI is no longer just
a buzzword in the fintech industry.

29
00:01:38,885 --> 00:01:42,565
It's a powerful tool that's
redefining how financial services

30
00:01:42,605 --> 00:01:44,245
are delivered to the end user.

31
00:01:44,715 --> 00:01:46,145
So why does all this matter?

32
00:01:46,955 --> 00:01:51,645
Financial institutions deal with
vast amounts of complex data and AI

33
00:01:51,854 --> 00:01:56,054
helps with streamlining this process,
reduce inefficiencies and enhance

34
00:01:56,054 --> 00:01:57,814
the overall customer experience.

35
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:02,155
So the current trends indicate
that financial fintech companies

36
00:02:02,185 --> 00:02:06,184
and also traditional financial
institutions both alike are adopting

37
00:02:06,195 --> 00:02:10,445
AI at a very rapid pace, and it's a
necessity to stay competitive, meet

38
00:02:10,445 --> 00:02:14,085
evolving regulatory requirements,
and reduce operational costs.

39
00:02:14,575 --> 00:02:18,804
today we'll explore how AI is driving
this transformation, focusing on

40
00:02:18,814 --> 00:02:21,845
both, its benefits and the challenges
we must address, to harness its

41
00:02:21,845 --> 00:02:23,325
full potential, responsibly.

42
00:02:23,825 --> 00:02:28,835
AI's impact, on FinTech is very profound,
and its implications can broadly be

43
00:02:28,835 --> 00:02:30,925
categorized into four different areas.

44
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,950
so the first one is fraud
detection, AI Excel set analyzing

45
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,180
transaction patterns in real time.

46
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,340
it helps with identifying potential
fraudulent activities with greater

47
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,210
accuracy than traditional systems.

48
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,990
In fact, fraud detection is one
of the major use case of AI in

49
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,740
many of the big tech companies.

50
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,240
it also provides, plays a major
role in personalized banking.

51
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,440
so through advanced analytics, AI can
provide tailored financial advice.

52
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,920
making these services, more accessible and
improving customer retention over time.

53
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,300
it is also becoming prominent
in algorithmic trading.

54
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,420
it enables the vast analysis of
vast market data to forecast trends

55
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,950
and optimize trade execution.

56
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,650
one example is the use of deep
learning models in stock, to predict,

57
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,250
stock, trends over a period of time.

58
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,630
and lastly, compliance.

59
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,729
AI automates the compliance process.

60
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,810
it can ensure financial institutions
stay updated with ever changing,

61
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,300
regulations, which in turn can
reduce, costs and, compliance risks.

62
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,649
we'll discuss each of these
applications in more, detail,

63
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,089
over the next, few slides.

64
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:38,369
so the fraud detection has always
been a major challenge for the

65
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:42,619
financial industry, but AI, provides
groundbreaking solutions here.

66
00:03:42,619 --> 00:03:45,279
It helps with real time analysis.

67
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:50,419
AI can analyze millions of transactions
instantly to identify anomalies and

68
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:52,249
flag potential fraudulent activity.

69
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,479
it, can also be a useful
tool for pattern recognition.

70
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:00,369
ML models continuously evolve,
recognizing new fraud patterns that

71
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:04,829
traditional systems might miss as you keep
training these models more frequently.

72
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,969
It can also significantly
impact financial security.

73
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:12,789
It helps reduce losses, minimizes
disruptions for genuine transactions,

74
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:14,989
and helps build consumer trust.

75
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:20,079
One example is a prominent
multinational bank which implemented

76
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,129
an AI driven fraud detection system.

77
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:27,409
And it cut false positives by
almost 60%, which not only reduces

78
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,829
the cost, but also significantly
improved customer satisfaction.

79
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:36,059
personalization is also very key to
modern customer, engagement and AI is

80
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:38,069
one of the main driving forces behind it.

81
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:41,599
it can be useful to provide
tailored financial advice.

82
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,989
It can assess individual spending
habits, goals, and income.

83
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:50,129
to offer customized guidance to,
end users it, AI powered robo

84
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:54,339
advisors, also democratize investment
management, making financial

85
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:58,499
planning affordable and accessible,
to all, classes of the society.

86
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,589
It also provides customer portfolios.

87
00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:06,859
AI considers unique factors such as
ESG preferences, tax implications,

88
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:10,549
and personal goals to build
highly personalized portfolios.

89
00:05:10,989 --> 00:05:14,809
The key impact is that this leads
to greater customer satisfaction

90
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:18,429
and deeper engagement as customers
feel that their financial needs are

91
00:05:18,429 --> 00:05:20,859
properly understood and prioritized.

92
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:25,379
Algorithmic trading is another
example of AI enhancing

93
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:27,549
profitability and market efficiency.

94
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:31,849
so market, AI can, analyze
last data sets in real time.

95
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:35,009
it helps identifying patterns
and opportunities for

96
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:36,439
optimal trade executions.

97
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:40,129
so as we've discussed earlier, deep
learning models can also help with

98
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:45,109
predicting, stock trends by analyzing
historical and current data, and

99
00:05:45,109 --> 00:05:47,029
enabling smarter investment strategies.

100
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:51,729
AI also optimizes trade timing and
execution, reducing transaction costs

101
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:53,869
and enhancing overall profitability.

102
00:05:54,369 --> 00:05:56,969
There's a point of caution though
here, while AI improves market

103
00:05:56,969 --> 00:06:02,239
efficiency, it also raises concerns
about market instability caused by

104
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,089
these automated trading strategies.

105
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:08,079
Regulatory compliance, is
another area where, AI, sorry.

106
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:10,809
Regulatory compliance is
another area where AI has made

107
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:12,909
significant strides recently.

108
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:16,859
AI also helps with automating,
data collection, processing

109
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:20,319
and reporting, reducing human
error and improving accuracy.

110
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:23,819
it helps with adapting to,
various governmental regulations.

111
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:27,039
ML models can track changes in
regulatory requirements and update

112
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,919
compliance processes automatically.

113
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:32,529
AI also provides predictive
insights and continuous monitoring.

114
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:35,579
helping institutions manage
these risks proactively.

115
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:41,209
For example, some institutions using
AI driven regulatory tech have reduced

116
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:46,029
their compliance cost by up to 30 percent
while improving the overall efficiency.

117
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:52,699
So the broader impact of AI on fintech
extends not just beyond these specific

118
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:57,699
applications, it can lead to operational
efficiencies, it helps reduce processing

119
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:01,739
times, human errors, and operational
costs driving productivity gains.

120
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:05,569
It also provides better customer
experience, can provide personalized

121
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,949
24 7 service through AI powered
tools, like chatbots, which help

122
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:11,679
redefine customer expectations.

123
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:17,189
AI can also be a catalyst for innovation
as it enables new financial products

124
00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:21,149
like alternative credit scoring
models and blockchain based solutions.

125
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:25,479
For example, AI chatbots routinely
handle customer inquiries now,

126
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:29,629
Freeing human staff to focus on
complex issues, improving both

127
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:33,029
their satisfaction, customer
satisfaction as well as efficiency.

128
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:38,399
Despite all the benefits that we have
discussed so far, AI in FinTech still

129
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,429
presents very critical challenges.

130
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:42,579
The first one is data privacy.

131
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,119
As everyone knows, financial
data is very sensitive.

132
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:49,869
It requires strong safeguards
and adherence to regulations.

133
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:53,309
One example is the GDPR
that came up recently.

134
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:58,039
There can also be the
challenge of algorithmic bias.

135
00:07:58,859 --> 00:08:03,739
The poorly designed AI models can
perpetuate biases, especially in

136
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:05,499
credit scoring and loan approvals.

137
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:10,149
Automation can also displace
jobs, which creates an urgent

138
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:13,149
need for workforce reskilling.

139
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:16,794
And finally, when it comes to
ethical AI, Transparent, unbiased,

140
00:08:16,814 --> 00:08:20,234
and secure AI models are very much
essential to maintaining trust

141
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:22,074
and ensuring ethical outcomes.

142
00:08:22,574 --> 00:08:27,444
To wrap up, AI is revolutionizing
financial services by enhancing

143
00:08:27,444 --> 00:08:30,844
fraud detection, personalization,
trading, and compliance.

144
00:08:31,504 --> 00:08:34,934
These advancements drive
operational efficiency, innovation,

145
00:08:34,944 --> 00:08:36,184
and financial inclusion.

146
00:08:37,174 --> 00:08:43,444
However, challenges like data privacy
bias require careful management as well.

147
00:08:43,944 --> 00:08:47,639
the FinTech industry ultimately must
prioritize ethical AI development,

148
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:52,049
robust data protection, and workforce
upskilling to ensure these technologies

149
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:53,909
serve the society, as a whole.

150
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,759
thank you, for your time
and attention today.

151
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:01,129
I hope this, presentation
provided valuable insights into

152
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:02,929
the role, AI plays in FinTech.

153
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:04,219
thanks again.

154
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:04,909
Bye.
