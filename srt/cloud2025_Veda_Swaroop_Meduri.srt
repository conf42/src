learn how this technological convergence

9
00:00:35,505 --> 00:00:40,545
or fostering innovations, operational
excellence across the diverse industries.

10
00:00:41,045 --> 00:00:46,805
So resource management revolutions, we
can divide this topic into, two parts.

11
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:49,845
Like the first one is the dynamic
scaling and the second one is

12
00:00:49,865 --> 00:00:51,045
the automated provisioning.

13
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:55,615
The dynamic scaling advanced AI
algorithms analyze the historical

14
00:00:55,645 --> 00:00:57,375
patterns on real time metrics.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,700
To predict resource demands with up to 95
percent accuracy, this intelligent scaling

16
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,730
automatically adjusts cloud resources
within seconds, maximizing the performance

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,770
during the traffic spikes while
