00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,850
Multi tenant architecture has
emerged as a cornerstone of modern

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,890
cloud computing, fundamentally
transforming how organizations

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,889
design and deploy software solutions.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,239
This presentation examines the principles,
implementation strategies, and best

5
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:22,099
practices for building robust multi
tenant systems in today's rapidly

6
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:24,890
evolving technological landscape.

7
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,180
Multi tenants is a powerful architecture
approach where a single software

8
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:35,739
application simultaneously serves multiple
independent organizations called tenants.

9
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,679
Each tenant experiences the
application as if they were on

10
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:44,529
their own dedicated instances while
behind the scene they share their

11
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:46,679
infrastructure resources efficiently.

12
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:51,779
This model ensures complete data
isolation and customization capabilities

13
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,314
while maximizing resource utilization
and reducing operational costs.

14
00:00:57,814 --> 00:01:00,974
Imagine an apartment building
where different people

15
00:01:01,354 --> 00:01:02,694
rent different apartments.

16
00:01:03,094 --> 00:01:08,184
Each person lives independently, but
they all share the same building.

17
00:01:08,574 --> 00:01:12,664
In the world of software, a multi
tenant system works the same way.

18
00:01:13,154 --> 00:01:18,484
Instead of apartment, different companies
or customers share the same software,

19
00:01:18,504 --> 00:01:23,134
but have their own separate space,
like their own data and settings.

20
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:28,379
This allows businesses to save
on cost, as they don't need to

21
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:31,459
build new systems for each tenant.

22
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:36,729
The multi tenant model revolutionized
software delivery in the early 2000s,

23
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:42,659
coinciding with the emergence of
cloud computing and SaaS platforms.

24
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,829
Before this innovation, organizations
had to deploy and maintain

25
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:50,529
separate application instances
for each customer, leading to

26
00:01:50,529 --> 00:01:53,619
significant overhead and complexity.

27
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,249
Today's sophisticated multi tenant
architecture have evolved to support

28
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:03,619
advanced features like tenant specific
customization, dynamic resource

29
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:08,259
allocation, and seamless scalability
across all application tiers.

30
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,889
Importance in modern
software architecture.

31
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:13,189
Resource optimization.

32
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:18,719
Multi tenancy maximizes return on
investment by intelligently sharing

33
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:24,019
computing resources across customers
while ensuring complete data isolation.

34
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:29,019
This approach dramatically reduces
infrastructure costs while maintaining

35
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:31,319
enterprise grade security standards.

36
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:36,989
Operational Efficiency By centralizing
maintenance and update across all

37
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:42,874
tenants, Multitenant architecture reduces
development cost and deployment times.

38
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:47,764
Teams can focus on innovation rather
than managing separate instances.

39
00:02:48,264 --> 00:02:52,694
Strategic Necessity In today's
competitive landscape, multitenancy

40
00:02:52,724 --> 00:02:54,104
is key for business growth.

41
00:02:55,054 --> 00:02:59,564
It helps companies to scale
fast, keep performance high.

42
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:04,729
and lower the cost, giving
them a strong competitive edge.

43
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:08,459
Difference between multi
tenant architecture and

44
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,769
single tenant architecture.

45
00:03:10,619 --> 00:03:11,859
Resource isolation.

46
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:18,109
Dedicated infrastructure with complete
isolation for single tenant applications.

47
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:24,129
Multi tenant application has virtual
isolation through data partitioning.

48
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:26,179
Cost efficiency.

49
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:31,679
Higher cost due to dedicated resources for
single tenant architecture applications.

50
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:36,959
In multi tenant applications, lower
cost due to shared installation.

51
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:37,699
Customization.

52
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,279
Unlimited customization potential.

53
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,149
Each tenant can have custom
features, configuration, and settings

54
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,629
for single tenant applications.

55
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:53,199
In multi tenant application, configurable
is limited due to platform constraints.

56
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:57,389
Since all tenants share the same
software, it is harder to provide

57
00:03:57,409 --> 00:04:01,989
specific customization for each
tenant without affecting others.

58
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:03,089
Maintenance.

59
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:07,549
Separate updates and maintenance cycles
are needed for single tenant applications.

60
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:12,109
Each instance needs to be maintained
individually, increasing overhead

61
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:14,169
for updates and bug fixes.

62
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:18,089
Since multi tenant applications
are single code based, The

63
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:20,039
simultaneous update can be performed.

64
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:25,419
Update and bug fixes can be applied
to the entire system at once

65
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:27,859
and deployed at the same time.

66
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:32,079
Core components of multi tenant
system are tenant identification

67
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:38,469
and authentication, data isolation
strategies, resource management, tenant

68
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:43,249
identification and authentication,
or it's a secure access management.

69
00:04:43,624 --> 00:04:49,834
at both tenant and user level, ensuring
each organization maintenance, complete

70
00:04:50,204 --> 00:04:54,424
control over their users and permission
while protecting sensitive data.

71
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:58,864
One of the most important goals in
multi tenancy is to make sure that

72
00:04:58,874 --> 00:05:00,724
tenants are isolated from each other.

73
00:05:01,224 --> 00:05:02,854
Data isolation strategies.

74
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:08,369
Ensure complete separation of tenant
data through multiple security layers,

75
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:13,379
guaranteeing that each organization's
information remains private and secure

76
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,199
while sharing the same infrastructure.

77
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:16,969
Resource management.

78
00:05:17,754 --> 00:05:22,284
Intelligently allocates and monitors
system resources to deliver optimal

79
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:23,894
performance for each tenant.

80
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:29,174
Automatically scaling resources up
or down based on individual needs.

81
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:34,304
With multiple system using same,
multiple tenants using same system,

82
00:05:34,714 --> 00:05:38,214
ensuring that system performs
well for all users is critical.

83
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:43,244
If one tenant experienced slow
performance or downtime, it

84
00:05:43,244 --> 00:05:45,184
could affect all the tenants.

85
00:05:45,684 --> 00:05:48,014
Data architecture and storage pattern.

86
00:05:48,295 --> 00:05:51,834
The first option is Shared
Database and Shared Tables.

87
00:05:52,284 --> 00:05:57,444
All tenants use the same database and
the tables, but each row is marked by

88
00:05:57,474 --> 00:06:00,334
the tenant ID to ensure separation.

89
00:06:00,984 --> 00:06:03,124
This is the most cost effective approach.

90
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:07,384
The second option is Shared
Database and Separate Tables.

91
00:06:07,944 --> 00:06:11,574
In this case, the database is the
same, but for each tenant, separate

92
00:06:11,574 --> 00:06:13,394
tables and schemas will be created.

93
00:06:13,395 --> 00:06:16,644
The third option is Separate database.

94
00:06:16,664 --> 00:06:19,594
Complete tenant isolation
with the dedicated databases.

95
00:06:19,974 --> 00:06:23,504
