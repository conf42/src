1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,660
Welcome to the conference.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,280
So we don't have any further ado.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:05,879
Let's get started.

4
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:11,180
Our intro react accessibility,
essential for developers, how to

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,670
make website accessible for everyone.

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,800
yeah, little about me.

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,160
My name is Rohini Samara.

8
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:18,920
I'm from Indonesia.

9
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:23,069
I work as a software developer,
but right now, currently, I'm

10
00:00:23,069 --> 00:00:24,819
assigned to front end deps.

11
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:32,379
Atelcom Indonesia and I've been working
in it industry in web development

12
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,674
more than five years right now.

13
00:00:35,534 --> 00:00:40,204
yeah, and I've been specialization
my, in, in my skill in front end.

14
00:00:41,134 --> 00:00:46,074
you can also follow along with
my links, my social media.

15
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:49,614
I have a podcast as well on YouTube.

16
00:00:49,764 --> 00:00:50,844
You can listen.

17
00:00:51,834 --> 00:00:53,274
There's a code of cares.

18
00:00:53,274 --> 00:00:59,494
you can follow me on the link in
Instagram or check my website as well.

19
00:00:59,994 --> 00:01:01,304
yeah, that's about me.

20
00:01:01,354 --> 00:01:02,214
Let's keep moving.

21
00:01:02,714 --> 00:01:08,394
So today's agenda, the topic
that we're going to cover up

22
00:01:08,774 --> 00:01:11,504
is, this is the main topic.

23
00:01:11,624 --> 00:01:17,864
So there's six main topic, but also
each main topic has a sub topic that

24
00:01:17,874 --> 00:01:19,354
we're going to cover up as well.

25
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:25,154
One is what is accessibility,
how user navigate a website.

26
00:01:25,414 --> 00:01:28,434
Three is the third is like
accessibility principles.

27
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,599
What are the benefits to all
of this and how you measure the

28
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,509
outage web for accessibility?

29
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,349
We're going to see in real action.

30
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:43,479
Of course, in this topic,
we're going to do with React.

31
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,659
And then we're going to also
see how test your components to

32
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,209
pass in accessibility aspects.

33
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:53,889
All right, so let's keep moving.

34
00:01:53,949 --> 00:01:54,779
Let's dive in.

35
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:59,689
So first thing first,
what is web accessibility?

36
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:00,729
Okay.

37
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,809
And what is the accessibility itself?

38
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:09,789
When you're saying the accessibility,
you can also like pronounce Ali or a 11.

39
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:10,349
Why?

40
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:14,519
Basically it's number name,
number password, yeah?

41
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:18,779
If you count it, there's
character 11 in there.

42
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:25,909
So it's same kubernetes, like k4s,
and also internalization, like i18s.

43
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:32,569
Yeah, you can also check, other things
in number name, but the accessibility

44
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:38,409
itself has the meaning of the
quality of being able to be answered

45
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:40,749
or to be accessed by the public.

46
00:02:41,249 --> 00:02:43,149
Including, people with several.

47
00:02:43,649 --> 00:02:50,009
So when it meets web, it combined to
something like web accessibility is when

48
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:57,759
you tooling, when you design, when you
develop your website so that everyone

49
00:02:58,309 --> 00:03:06,569
can access, can, use your website,
including people with disabilities.

50
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:10,099
More specifically, they can like proceed.

51
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:15,069
Understand, navigate, interact,
even contribute to the web itself.

52
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:18,479
There is some quotes from Maripet Tadapo.

53
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:22,009
she was like one director IBM back then.

54
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:27,689
People, for people without disabilities,
technology make things easier.

55
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:31,929
For people with disabilities,
technology make things possible.

56
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:37,999
If we take a look in this
modernity days, yeah, technology

57
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:39,639
make things easier for people.

58
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:45,214
For us, for people with disabilities,
for people with disabled, technically

59
00:03:45,364 --> 00:03:47,304
make things possible, even better.

60
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:53,334
in the past, we never thought that
we can get this, get those things,

61
00:03:53,374 --> 00:03:59,404
but like now it's always a better
when it was designed for disabled.

62
00:03:59,404 --> 00:04:02,574
Then it also make better
for everyone else.

63
00:04:02,645 --> 00:04:08,584
For example, in real life case, you
know the story behind the clear cut

64
00:04:08,584 --> 00:04:15,914
and sidewalk So it was back then it was
back to the American pattern in World

65
00:04:15,914 --> 00:04:23,224
War two They have back to the country
Some of them end up in wheelchair So

66
00:04:23,454 --> 00:04:30,104
they have to walk with wheelchairs
and walking stick but when they want

67
00:04:30,114 --> 00:04:39,584
to try to Go to the road, there's no
like curb cut so they can, walk, or

68
00:04:39,724 --> 00:04:43,294
answering to the access the sidewalk.

69
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:44,224
Okay.

70
00:04:44,674 --> 00:04:49,064
they need to go to the edge of
the road to find like ramps or

71
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:51,154
something to lift off their weight.

72
00:04:51,654 --> 00:04:53,844
But, and then they wanted a fairness.

73
00:04:53,854 --> 00:04:59,664
So some architect design, like the curb
cut in the middle, right on the road.

74
00:05:00,194 --> 00:05:05,154
So when it was Designed for disabled.

75
00:05:05,164 --> 00:05:08,154
It's also made things better for everyone.

76
00:05:08,164 --> 00:05:14,684
If have stroller or bike with you, you
can just leave off your things with you

77
00:05:14,944 --> 00:05:20,484
along the way with, going to the sidewalk,
not, you don't have to go to the edge

78
00:05:20,504 --> 00:05:23,224
anymore to find the Rams or something.

79
00:05:23,674 --> 00:05:29,114
And the other real life case
is the talking calculator.

80
00:05:29,614 --> 00:05:34,614
it was meant for people
with vision problems.

81
00:05:35,274 --> 00:05:40,104
And then if we see the application
right now, it was like, it

82
00:05:40,104 --> 00:05:45,844
was like, inspired from the
calculating the talking calculator.

83
00:05:46,754 --> 00:05:53,714
you can right now, go to somewhere
without any, without having no.

84
00:05:54,429 --> 00:06:01,009
the path of the place itself, you
can just guide it by some navigation

85
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,859
in your pocket in your phone, right?

86
00:06:04,249 --> 00:06:09,719
Because there's the same concept,
the same technology they use, which

87
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:17,059
is tech to speech or, voice to tech
system for us to take a concept.

88
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:21,969
The other thing is the caption,
closed caption or subtitles.

89
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:29,419
Right now, you can just easily understand
how people, talk or speak in the

90
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:34,809
contents because you actually turn on
the closed caption and you understand,

91
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:38,389
without any, hardly to know it anymore.

92
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:44,819
So how we get involved
with this community?

93
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:47,359
what we can do about it?

94
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:49,229
How can we make?

95
00:06:49,774 --> 00:06:56,734
we're better place, but we need to
understand first how actual user

96
00:06:56,774 --> 00:06:59,374
navigating the website, right?

97
00:06:59,394 --> 00:07:06,504
Before we jump into, how we built the
website can, accessible to all the user.

98
00:07:07,234 --> 00:07:11,994
We need to also first thing
first, we need to know how actual

99
00:07:11,994 --> 00:07:13,974
user navigating the website.

100
00:07:14,474 --> 00:07:19,224
First, the answer is to this
using the assistive technology.

101
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:26,249
And adaptive strategy when you're saying
about the, adaptive strategy is more

102
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:30,349
to the, Peters on your web application.

103
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,189
you have, Jumi and Jim out many magnifier.

104
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:38,359
Settings on your application,
you can change the phone color,

105
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:40,229
phone size, setting, etc.

106
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:46,139
It's like more strategy of your, how
your website approach to the problems.

107
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:51,629
And, when you're saying assistive
technology is more combining of the

108
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:54,029
software and the hardware itself.

109
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:55,279
All right.

110
00:07:56,209 --> 00:08:00,809
So like this, hardware like
keyboard, touch screen readers.

111
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:07,359
even more, more, more expensive,
device like SIP and POP device.

112
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:08,289
Yeah.

113
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,689
so many, so many headwear,
so many, devices that can be

114
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,459
used for, disabled people.

115
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:23,889
But the common things, they face in, in,
in real life case, the common problem they

116
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:27,779
face is lack of keyboard accessibility.

117
00:08:28,484 --> 00:08:29,434
And the website.

118
00:08:29,824 --> 00:08:34,594
So when they're trying to,
navigating the website, especially

119
00:08:34,604 --> 00:08:40,804
for, physical disability cases,
the company is the easiest device

120
00:08:40,804 --> 00:08:42,344
for them, which is the keyboard.

121
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:50,894
But in the field of reality, keyboard
is not fully support by the website.

122
00:08:51,394 --> 00:08:56,664
It just, few percent, I know
in the world website, they can.

123
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:59,379
The, access by the keyboard.

124
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:05,399
So for example, they want to navigate
in the website, but, the keyboard is not

125
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:12,609
functionally, correctly in, in that, in
those website, the other common problem

126
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,329
they face is lack of visible focus.

127
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:22,659
The keyboard is there, working, but
they couldn't see, which, the item,

128
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:27,869
or which, the page, or which the
button they currently, hovering on,

129
00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:33,879
or, yeah, they couldn't see which,
the focus they, Right now, stay.

130
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,219
Okay.

131
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,959
And the other thing is the focus order.

132
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:45,109
Maybe the focus is not, it's not
quietly correct, like when they

133
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:53,389
trying to hovering or navigating to
button A and then the focus is in

134
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,009
the button B or something like that.

135
00:09:56,654 --> 00:09:58,874
So it's just quite a problem, right?

136
00:09:59,374 --> 00:10:04,624
And the other problem is for
visual and physical disabled.

137
00:10:05,124 --> 00:10:09,944
Disabilities is the same, the
keyboard accessibility, like a

138
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:12,094
visible focus and focus order.

139
00:10:12,364 --> 00:10:17,924
So here's this example of the expressive
device that are, as if technology that I

140
00:10:17,954 --> 00:10:20,804
mentioned before is zip and pop device.

141
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:26,374
The other thing is physical and personal
disabilities, also they face the same

142
00:10:26,404 --> 00:10:32,314
problem, but right now there's some
additional, which is the anchor links

143
00:10:32,344 --> 00:10:38,604
and buttons, and then I'll, the third,
the second one is the illogical.

144
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:46,829
Focus order and for possibility focus
and least not, but last but not least

145
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:49,989
is the missing the alternative contents.

146
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:50,609
Okay.

147
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:57,429
So for people with problem in
their visual, they couldn't find.

148
00:10:57,929 --> 00:11:04,789
Alternative content for like their images
for their, tags or for their voice.

149
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:10,359
So, this is problem for them when
they want to see the image, but.

150
00:11:11,109 --> 00:11:17,779
The, but the website couldn't tell what
is in the image because they missing

151
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:20,299
the authority, which is a problem.

152
00:11:20,349 --> 00:11:24,329
So the other thing is physical
and physical disabilities.

153
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:27,159
Is this, this case is completely blind.

154
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:31,489
the problem is the same like
previous, but there's some,

155
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:33,809
additional like unclear structure.

156
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:33,829
Yeah.

157
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:38,199
Maybe, the structure of the
website is not fully correct,

158
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,479
which is also, it is a problem.

159
00:11:40,979 --> 00:11:46,479
the other thing is for low vision people,
the camera problem they face is the

160
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:54,019
phone size is too small or maybe too big
and the contrast on the colors to four.

161
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:58,169
And also they, relying on
the colors or maybe like.

162
00:11:58,944 --> 00:12:04,724
the color is not good when you see
it with your eyes or something.

163
00:12:05,204 --> 00:12:10,924
And also the animation and the
moving one is like too fast or

164
00:12:10,954 --> 00:12:13,384
something like so many animation.

165
00:12:13,404 --> 00:12:15,244
So it's also a problem.

166
00:12:15,744 --> 00:12:24,084
The other case is the hearing disabilities
with people problem with people with

167
00:12:24,084 --> 00:12:26,134
problem in their hearing disabilities.

168
00:12:26,894 --> 00:12:31,074
Maybe the common problem they
face is there's no closed caption,

169
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,904
there's no subtitle, no transcript.

170
00:12:33,964 --> 00:12:37,514
Even in the higher level, maybe
there's no sign language in

171
00:12:37,514 --> 00:12:39,244
your contents of the website.

172
00:12:39,284 --> 00:12:41,504
the people with the hearing disabled can.

173
00:12:41,934 --> 00:12:45,444
Can understand, cannot understand
about the topic that you're

174
00:12:45,454 --> 00:12:48,234
trying to, communicate or inform

175
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:53,404
last but not least the case of
hearing and cognitive learning

176
00:12:53,404 --> 00:12:55,464
disabilities is also the same.

177
00:12:55,644 --> 00:13:01,594
So people with problem in their
cognitive learning disabilities, maybe,

178
00:13:01,884 --> 00:13:06,559
the cost caption, subtractor, even
in the higher language sign language

179
00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:09,569
is not there and not in your content.

180
00:13:10,024 --> 00:13:11,064
Which is a problem.

181
00:13:11,434 --> 00:13:12,704
So we need to fix it.

182
00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:14,654
How are we going to fix it?

183
00:13:15,154 --> 00:13:22,634
We can fix it, in, in, in taking
real action, in the next slide.

184
00:13:23,374 --> 00:13:30,064
So we need to also see first the
principle of the accessibility itself.

185
00:13:30,564 --> 00:13:37,194
After we already know what kind of
those problems, we also can break

186
00:13:37,194 --> 00:13:39,694
it down to this principle as well.

187
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:44,534
So the principle of accessibility,
there's four principles.

188
00:13:45,464 --> 00:13:46,874
One is perceptible.

189
00:13:46,884 --> 00:13:48,434
The first is perceptible.

190
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,014
The second one is operable.

191
00:13:51,344 --> 00:13:53,244
And the third one is understandable.

192
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,174
The fourth is the robust.

193
00:13:56,484 --> 00:13:59,404
So are we going to explain it one by one?

194
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:01,284
What is the perceivable?

195
00:14:01,604 --> 00:14:07,724
The visible mean can the information of
the content can be present in different

196
00:14:07,724 --> 00:14:14,354
ways, like in braille, different text
size, text to speech, all works on

197
00:14:14,364 --> 00:14:17,384
different, device or ways to present.

198
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:23,754
For example, that we saw earlier
is if, If your user can see the

199
00:14:23,754 --> 00:14:28,764
image, you need to provide the
alternative content for those people.

200
00:14:29,264 --> 00:14:35,224
For example, if you, missing the alternate
content in image, you can also add

201
00:14:35,234 --> 00:14:38,164
some alternative text to your images.

202
00:14:38,664 --> 00:14:43,304
And the other thing is if you,
if your content on the website is

203
00:14:43,304 --> 00:14:48,514
time based media, You can also add
some transcript or sub subtitle,

204
00:14:48,584 --> 00:14:50,724
closed caption to the content.

205
00:14:51,174 --> 00:14:57,094
So the people with hearing disabled can
understand what's actually content that

206
00:14:57,114 --> 00:15:01,364
you're trying to, inform to their, okay.

207
00:15:01,874 --> 00:15:05,214
Today, the other thing
is adaptable content.

208
00:15:05,214 --> 00:15:11,104
So make sure your website is, can
be, adaptable to the, to its content.

209
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:11,334
like.

210
00:15:12,034 --> 00:15:16,204
the header is, will be always there
and the content can be scrollable.

211
00:15:16,704 --> 00:15:17,074
Okay.

212
00:15:17,574 --> 00:15:22,534
yeah, the point is, this
content is, so shouldn't be,

213
00:15:22,784 --> 00:15:24,554
losing without any information.

214
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:28,974
And the other thing is make
sure you have this string of

215
00:15:28,974 --> 00:15:30,944
this distinguishable content.

216
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:35,994
So when you have like different
state, like active, inactive,

217
00:15:36,984 --> 00:15:42,394
The user can see the difference
in your pages or in your form.

218
00:15:42,614 --> 00:15:48,894
So for example, if they see an error,
they should have see an error like this.

219
00:15:49,594 --> 00:15:56,814
When the set is inactive, they can
also see different, content in here.

220
00:15:57,314 --> 00:16:00,784
This, for example, is mute,
unmute, something like this.

221
00:16:01,664 --> 00:16:02,044
Okay.

222
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,724
So the other principle is operable.

223
00:16:05,774 --> 00:16:10,664
your website can functionality can
be used in different modalities.

224
00:16:11,164 --> 00:16:15,674
Which is like we saw earlier,
it can be keyboard accessible.

225
00:16:16,154 --> 00:16:20,234
we can use tapping by the touch
screen, something like that.

226
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:29,304
And also make sure you provide enough time
to you, the user to see your content or

227
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:32,484
to read the content, with enough time.

228
00:16:32,984 --> 00:16:38,434
because many website, when they
providing the slider or something,

229
00:16:39,404 --> 00:16:42,534
the slider configuration is too fast.

230
00:16:42,814 --> 00:16:50,364
So the people can, the user can read or
can see the enough time for that slider.

231
00:16:50,914 --> 00:16:54,534
another thing is avoid
seizures and physical reaction.

232
00:16:54,594 --> 00:16:59,034
Like we saw earlier, it's like too
many animation in your website.

233
00:16:59,504 --> 00:17:00,334
It's not good.

234
00:17:00,594 --> 00:17:06,654
You need to keep it down your
animation to make it all, good

235
00:17:06,974 --> 00:17:09,114
or, great for all the user.

236
00:17:09,614 --> 00:17:11,854
the other thing is not visible content.

237
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:16,134
So make sure your website,
can be navigable navigate.

238
00:17:16,224 --> 00:17:17,794
So do it's user.

239
00:17:18,294 --> 00:17:20,224
they knew where they are.

240
00:17:20,484 --> 00:17:24,874
Like if they're trying to
navigate to fry same badge.

241
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:34,589
then you also need to mark that your web
or your page is currently on the pricing

242
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:42,429
page, which is, you can use different
color in the, tab on your website.

243
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:45,019
pages activated

244
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:50,989
and yeah, and for my little, this can be
input by various beyond a keyboard like

245
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:54,809
touch screen, mouse, keyboard, et cetera.

246
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:57,419
The other point is understandable.

247
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:03,429
It mean, your content information
on your website can be, understand.

248
00:18:04,254 --> 00:18:10,064
And by it's simple language, for
example, you can write your caption,

249
00:18:10,074 --> 00:18:12,874
your wordings is, to the point.

250
00:18:13,654 --> 00:18:20,414
So make it easier, to research,
to read something and also make

251
00:18:20,414 --> 00:18:22,744
sure your website is predictable.

252
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:26,334
like the header is always on the top.

253
00:18:26,684 --> 00:18:28,714
The footer is always on the bottom.

254
00:18:29,504 --> 00:18:30,644
Don't make it your website.

255
00:18:30,924 --> 00:18:32,644
Can be like, every.

256
00:18:33,569 --> 00:18:39,259
Every visit page, every change the
page, the layout is also changes.

257
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:45,079
Like when you are on the homepage,
then the header is on the top.

258
00:18:45,129 --> 00:18:51,169
When you go to order somewhere
else page, then the header

259
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:53,189
is like going to the bottom.

260
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:54,639
It's not good enough.

261
00:18:54,829 --> 00:18:55,589
because it's not.

262
00:18:56,054 --> 00:18:59,834
Predictable, the content is
not predictable, which is, we

263
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:02,024
need to avoid that as well.

264
00:19:02,524 --> 00:19:05,054
And the other thing is input assistant.

265
00:19:05,324 --> 00:19:11,604
when you saw inputting like long
form, they need to have info system.

266
00:19:11,614 --> 00:19:15,364
What should the input
that are going to fill in?

267
00:19:15,464 --> 00:19:20,965
Like when you entering email, you
have Having the input assistant for

268
00:19:20,965 --> 00:19:27,235
example, you need to palliate your email
using the app and blah, blah, blah.

269
00:19:27,635 --> 00:19:35,195
And then also you can provide like, how
long for the password, what can be used

270
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:40,185
in password and what can be cannot to be
entered in password, something like that.

271
00:19:40,685 --> 00:19:42,135
So that's the input assistant.

272
00:19:42,195 --> 00:19:45,245
And the last but not least is the robust.

273
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:50,675
Robots can mean can be, your
website can be, access in different

274
00:19:50,685 --> 00:19:52,585
sides, like in mobile device.

275
00:19:53,085 --> 00:20:00,135
And smart TV or in your smartwatch
or something, yeah, it can be, access

276
00:20:00,195 --> 00:20:02,715
by different sites, screen sites.

277
00:20:03,215 --> 00:20:09,915
And if you check other guidelines of the
WCAG best on web content, accessibility

278
00:20:09,935 --> 00:20:12,815
guidelines, you can see, more.

279
00:20:13,415 --> 00:20:14,545
Criteria in there.

280
00:20:14,885 --> 00:20:15,175
yeah,

281
00:20:15,675 --> 00:20:18,535
so let's talk more technical right now.

282
00:20:18,545 --> 00:20:21,135
See in the real action in react.

283
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:21,825
js.

284
00:20:22,325 --> 00:20:28,725
we saw already about the
problems in the previous slides.

285
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:37,325
Now we want to know how to approach, how
to approach those kind of problems with

286
00:20:37,345 --> 00:20:39,705
the solution that we're going to see.

287
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:41,585
In the next slide.

288
00:20:42,265 --> 00:20:45,245
Okay, so the problem.

289
00:20:45,365 --> 00:20:47,165
The first problem that we see.

290
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:51,445
a little is like of
keyboard accessibility.

291
00:20:51,945 --> 00:20:52,445
Okay.

292
00:20:52,945 --> 00:20:59,595
The keyboard accessibility or we can do
is by adding some tab index to the element

293
00:20:59,705 --> 00:21:02,595
or to the component that we provide.

294
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:03,745
Okay.

295
00:21:04,045 --> 00:21:07,165
Tab index is good for the
keyboard accessibility.

296
00:21:07,715 --> 00:21:11,880
but when you're seeing the tab
index, you're You need to be

297
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,850
careful in here because not
type index is always the answer.

298
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:22,260
For example, if you had type index
negative one, it not appear in

299
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:29,300
natural type order because the
type index minus one is good for

300
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,360
the dialogue or model components.

301
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:38,420
For example, if you have like
model or dialogue in your.

302
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,930
Website type index minus zero minus one.

303
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,420
I'm sorry.

304
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,180
It's good for that.

305
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,820
So for example, you can use,
Jack worry, something like that.

306
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,370
And then you're seeing using the
focus, or you can also like using

307
00:21:54,370 --> 00:22:00,990
the type index, minus one, the common
way to do tab index, you can add

308
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,670
the tab zero so it can, it will be.

309
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,170
Appear in natural tab
order in the browser.

310
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:15,490
it can be also, focused by the browser
in, in, in the natural tab order.

311
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:21,320
So the more you adding tab index,
if there, if you have like multiple

312
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:27,310
type index, the first thing, it will
be up here and the natural tab order

313
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:32,780
will be the least number, which is
if you adding more type index, like

314
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:38,280
One, two, three, the first thing
that, it will appear in the tab.

315
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,740
Natural order will be the first
one and so on and so forth.

316
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,990
So the, this, the tab index number
two is will be the second, third.

317
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,920
yeah, so on.

318
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:55,370
So the problem that we
saw also focus visibility.

319
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,510
What we can do is adding by.

320
00:22:59,035 --> 00:23:05,025
by different states in your styling,
components or elements, for example,

321
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:10,325
like on your button, we can add some
Hoover focus, something like that.

322
00:23:10,325 --> 00:23:11,115
So when.

323
00:23:11,645 --> 00:23:17,155
When do you start trying to navigate
hovering, do the button or the elements

324
00:23:17,155 --> 00:23:22,615
that you want to, they want to trying
to navigate, they can now see the

325
00:23:22,615 --> 00:23:27,595
different, like when they hovering,
Oh, it's different from Fordham.

326
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:34,875
So when they entering, they, the color
is now different from previous state.

327
00:23:35,425 --> 00:23:40,555
And React, obviously we can use
the autofocus, something like that.

328
00:23:41,035 --> 00:23:49,255
So when they trying to, focusing,
when the user face problem that,

329
00:23:49,735 --> 00:23:56,345
like of auto focus in their input,
in react, you can provide auto focus.

330
00:23:56,355 --> 00:24:01,655
So when they're trying to refreshing
the page or entering the page for

331
00:24:01,655 --> 00:24:05,575
the first time, it will be focusing
on something that you want trying

332
00:24:05,575 --> 00:24:08,335
to focus on in the first place.

333
00:24:08,835 --> 00:24:12,225
For example, in here, I'm trying
to auto focus the password.

334
00:24:12,225 --> 00:24:16,245
So it will be focused in the
first time in the first place.

335
00:24:16,795 --> 00:24:22,545
in other, method, we can also use,
focus with wrap and hooks and react.

336
00:24:22,835 --> 00:24:28,085
So, not only using the autofocus,
native autofocus by the HTML, we can

337
00:24:28,095 --> 00:24:33,205
use a approach with a react custom wrap
and custom hook, something like this.

338
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:40,040
We can, use the wrap, attribute
in here, and then we assign it the

339
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,540
input in here, the variable input.

340
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,920
And then we use wrap something like that.

341
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:51,430
Then we call it the input
to make it focus on Julia.

342
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,180
See, it's the same, right?

343
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:01,860
yeah, the problem, the C we see over
here is, uncreate links, uncreate

344
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:07,100
structure, maybe because they see
the uncreate links, maybe your

345
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,700
website is not providing the right.

346
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,020
Element to provide, to see, to
see the links in the website.

347
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:20,320
So make sure when you're
trying to provide a links to

348
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,730
website, use the right elements.

349
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:32,880
If you want to try to provide some
link, use anchor tag or anchor, a tag.

350
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:42,180
In your HTML or in your website, not using
like span or dip by, by, by the element.

351
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:49,190
And then you make it those spanners that
deep looks like a link or something.

352
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,450
Because why?

353
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:56,710
Because it won't work in browser
because when you use the tag

354
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:02,740
element or anchor in your website
for the links, obviously for the.

355
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:07,660
for the links, it's always show up
in the link list on your browser.

356
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:11,140
Also, it will work with keyboard.

357
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:17,090
Okay, so anchor link or anchor
tag, it obviously works with the

358
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,670
keyboard by default in the browser.

359
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:25,650
Other than that, if you're using
like deep or span to the links,

360
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,750
it won't work with the keyboard.

361
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:33,440
And also by the default in
the browser, your links can

362
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,120
be bookmarked, by the default.

363
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:40,080
If you're using like anchor tag
or something, in your browser,

364
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,450
in your, your website can be
bookmarked through the links.

365
00:26:46,175 --> 00:26:53,345
Of your anchor tag or egg, a take, and
the other thing is unclear structure.

366
00:26:53,395 --> 00:26:59,485
maybe your website, it didn't have
like ambiguous section because you

367
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:05,865
didn't use the semantic way to do
that, to do structuring, because you

368
00:27:06,435 --> 00:27:09,205
want, you use a bunch of diff instead.

369
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:16,870
I did for Heather did for navigation
so we can see the different in here.

370
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:20,850
This is like clear
section for the website.

371
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:26,920
the browser will understand
if you're using the semantic

372
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,380
element in your website.

373
00:27:29,935 --> 00:27:35,495
The browser can, analyze your header,
which is your header and navigation,

374
00:27:35,785 --> 00:27:40,765
which your section, which your
feed with your footer, everything

375
00:27:41,005 --> 00:27:43,715
it's work with the default browser.

376
00:27:43,785 --> 00:27:46,395
If you're using semantic elements.

377
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:46,935
Okay.

378
00:27:47,435 --> 00:27:52,835
So if you combine it, semantic
and the deep, it's more good.

379
00:27:53,185 --> 00:27:57,335
For example, if you want to
wrap your header with deep.

380
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:02,605
But you need to wrap it
first with the header first.

381
00:28:02,805 --> 00:28:08,855
and then the second, the second, Level in
your header, you can use the deep in here.

382
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:13,025
So in react also, they
have the same thing.

383
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:21,505
So in react, if we, if we try to
build your own components, it will

384
00:28:21,505 --> 00:28:23,845
be, Confiles into like this, right?

385
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,180
From this one into this,

386
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:33,163
like when you're trying to make your
own button in react, you, it will be

387
00:28:33,163 --> 00:28:34,893
transformed to something like that.

388
00:28:35,393 --> 00:28:35,993
Click me.

389
00:28:36,313 --> 00:28:41,103
So make sure when you, creating
your own components, make sure

390
00:28:41,423 --> 00:28:45,643
you, you type it, you write the
components with the right, Okay.

391
00:28:46,143 --> 00:28:54,103
Because in the, browser, when you
trying to make your own components,

392
00:28:54,353 --> 00:28:59,003
everything in the browser will be,
transformed into the accessibility

393
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:01,053
tree, which is accessibility.

394
00:29:01,053 --> 00:29:03,318
Three is a use.

395
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:11,068
For people with disabilities, for
example, people with, vision problem with

396
00:29:11,098 --> 00:29:17,938
the problem in their vision, in their
visual, the way they see the website

397
00:29:17,988 --> 00:29:20,148
is through the accessibility tree.

398
00:29:20,978 --> 00:29:21,448
Okay.

399
00:29:21,698 --> 00:29:23,668
for people with a disability.

400
00:29:24,418 --> 00:29:28,208
The HTML code that we, program earlier.

401
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:33,338
For example, we create some components,
something like that, et cetera, in

402
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:37,118
the browser, it will become files to
the DOM tree, something like that.

403
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:44,708
Then it will be, defined whether it's JS
or HTML, and then it will be output to

404
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:50,648
the, user interface, which is, we can see
in the browser we're seeing our monitor

405
00:29:50,848 --> 00:29:52,598
or something like that or something else.

406
00:29:53,343 --> 00:30:01,153
But in the user with visual disabilities,
the journey is not end there because

407
00:30:01,173 --> 00:30:04,563
the DOM has to be trans file.

408
00:30:05,063 --> 00:30:05,443
Okay.

409
00:30:05,913 --> 00:30:11,963
Has to be comfort into another,
and to another, way, which is,

410
00:30:12,623 --> 00:30:17,623
they need to transform into the
accessibility tree so they can.

411
00:30:18,353 --> 00:30:25,863
read the user can read, the browser
can read, they can read directly

412
00:30:25,953 --> 00:30:31,543
from the accessibility tree
using, native API in the browser.

413
00:30:32,043 --> 00:30:32,453
Okay.

414
00:30:32,953 --> 00:30:37,223
we can use, they can use the
same technology they want, like

415
00:30:37,643 --> 00:30:41,323
screen readers or something,
touch screen, something like that.

416
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:41,363
Okay.

417
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:47,258
yeah, with the screen readers,
they will provide read API

418
00:30:47,258 --> 00:30:48,498
native by the accessibility tree.

419
00:30:49,118 --> 00:30:53,078
So the screen reader, we're only
looking for the accessibility

420
00:30:53,298 --> 00:30:55,248
tree, not using the DOM tree.

421
00:30:55,748 --> 00:31:02,258
So for example, if you, to try, if you
want to play in your browser, you can

422
00:31:02,258 --> 00:31:04,388
also like check in the spec element.

423
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:09,538
And then you can see the accessibility
section in the bottom of your

424
00:31:09,538 --> 00:31:11,878
inspect, in Chrome DevTools.

425
00:31:12,588 --> 00:31:16,868
So you can see, this is the accessibility
tree that I mentioned before.

426
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:22,328
this generic is mean something like div,
and then banner, navigation, list item.

427
00:31:22,838 --> 00:31:25,503
Then we have like area level,
dark mode, something like that.

428
00:31:26,003 --> 00:31:36,533
So the other thing is, we see is the same
kind of, lack of visual, maybe in the

429
00:31:36,533 --> 00:31:39,783
screen reader, it'd be something like
blah, blah, blah, check, check, blah.

430
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:41,683
This is not good.

431
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:45,973
What we can do is we
wrap and onto the level.

432
00:31:46,483 --> 00:31:49,723
So when the screen reader
read, we'll be like something.

433
00:31:50,123 --> 00:31:53,503
Receive promotional
offers, check, checkbox.

434
00:31:53,983 --> 00:31:56,863
Receive promotional offers
input, check, checkbox.

435
00:31:56,923 --> 00:32:01,723
And then they're trying to, announce
the state and then the type of

436
00:32:01,723 --> 00:32:03,573
the checkbox, of the input itself.

437
00:32:04,073 --> 00:32:09,553
Or you can use the ID, then using
the label for something like that.

438
00:32:10,493 --> 00:32:18,163
the other thing we can do is when
you dealing with the titles, okay.

439
00:32:19,023 --> 00:32:24,653
The common mistake that we see is,
the changes of titles, when changing

440
00:32:24,683 --> 00:32:27,763
pages, the title is not updated.

441
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:32,563
So in react, you can also use
the react, react, element.

442
00:32:32,563 --> 00:32:32,613
Okay.

443
00:32:33,313 --> 00:32:39,263
React Helmet, so it will be
changed the title to customize

444
00:32:39,283 --> 00:32:41,513
by yourself in other frameworks.

445
00:32:41,533 --> 00:32:46,263
Also, you can use dynamic,
title in Angular or Vue, you can

446
00:32:46,293 --> 00:32:49,233
easily change the title as well.

447
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:55,153
So make sure, also the title on
the website is always updated

448
00:32:55,253 --> 00:33:00,298
based on your Page that you're
trying to visit by the user.

449
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:05,768
So the other thing, a project
we can fix the problem.

450
00:33:05,778 --> 00:33:07,608
The solution is way area.

451
00:33:08,108 --> 00:33:12,968
Way areas mean web accessibility
initiative, accessibility,

452
00:33:12,968 --> 00:33:14,268
rich internet application.

453
00:33:14,768 --> 00:33:19,638
Let's imagine if you're trying to
make your own components, okay.

454
00:33:19,948 --> 00:33:24,938
But there's no like semantic ways or
there's no semantic element to do that.

455
00:33:24,939 --> 00:33:25,088
Okay.

456
00:33:25,828 --> 00:33:30,668
what you can do is like you
build your own custom components

457
00:33:31,098 --> 00:33:33,658
from, from different element.

458
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:41,028
For example, if you want to make some,
toggle button or switch box, something

459
00:33:41,028 --> 00:33:47,768
like that, what you can do is using
deep and then you make up those diff

460
00:33:48,128 --> 00:33:52,478
into a switch box or check book.

461
00:33:52,498 --> 00:34:00,273
So So yeah, this way area is
designed for those components.

462
00:34:00,773 --> 00:34:03,533
Way area is designed for those component.

463
00:34:03,593 --> 00:34:07,303
It can be, use it to different, element.

464
00:34:07,953 --> 00:34:09,453
For example, like this.

465
00:34:10,383 --> 00:34:14,313
you can add some roll
and area check state.

466
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:16,138
To the checkbox.

467
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:22,748
So the screen reader now see the deep
that those deep is the checkbook.

468
00:34:23,248 --> 00:34:29,458
Because if you didn't add some like
cement, way area to those, custom

469
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:32,058
element or custom component, you created.

470
00:34:33,008 --> 00:34:37,768
The screen readers in the
accessibility tree only tell you

471
00:34:38,218 --> 00:34:40,608
it's just a div or it's just text.

472
00:34:41,108 --> 00:34:48,438
But if you like assign the raw
way area in here, you can see the

473
00:34:48,438 --> 00:34:53,978
different screen reader will tell
you this is will be checkbox.

474
00:34:54,198 --> 00:34:58,088
And the name is 3G
promotion offers the label.

475
00:34:58,883 --> 00:35:03,273
This, and then the state of that
checkbook will be like check or

476
00:35:03,283 --> 00:35:05,343
not check that something like that.

477
00:35:05,843 --> 00:35:13,753
So the under the hoods, how area
works is when the accessibility

478
00:35:13,803 --> 00:35:16,023
tree is only scanning.

479
00:35:16,803 --> 00:35:23,073
by the dome with the area, before it
transformed to, before it transformed,

480
00:35:23,133 --> 00:35:29,184
converted to the accessibility tree,
the, like the dome will be telling the

481
00:35:29,184 --> 00:35:31,644
accessibility tree and scan it first.

482
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:36,529
If there's like area or something
in, in the element of their dome.

483
00:35:37,029 --> 00:35:42,699
And then the dome will be compared to
the accessibility and then tell the

484
00:35:42,699 --> 00:35:51,419
accessibility like, Hey, this dip is, Hey,
this dip or Hey, this dip is a button.

485
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:55,289
So make sure treat this deep as a button.

486
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:59,559
And then after that, don't tell
him to the extra 33 like that.

487
00:36:00,094 --> 00:36:01,904
Texture between okay, got it.

488
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:06,154
I will treat this tip as a button.

489
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:07,514
And then that's.

490
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:14,409
That's why before the DOM, transform to
the accessibility, it will be like telling

491
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:21,129
and force for the moment, see if there's
like area or, area, way area or something,

492
00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:24,509
attribute to tell to the accessibility.

493
00:36:24,509 --> 00:36:28,989
So before they, transform
our C to the user

494
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:30,409
and the react.

495
00:36:30,469 --> 00:36:32,719
Also, we have the same thing.

496
00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:42,059
we can approach with a subject abstracting
components, when you want to creating

497
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:49,829
dynamic component in your component,
you can use the, as in here as, as prop.

498
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:56,509
So later when you want to build
dynamic, element or component

499
00:36:56,539 --> 00:36:58,609
in your website, you can use as.

500
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:05,659
props in here, for example, you
can now, heading level in heading

501
00:37:05,659 --> 00:37:10,409
one in here, and then you can also
change like heading to cetera.

502
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:14,739
We can see in the real demo after this.

503
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:17,159
So yeah, bear with me to see.

504
00:37:17,659 --> 00:37:21,979
So yeah, for example, in here,
we adding like dynamic style

505
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:24,038
and as the fee will come to it.

506
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:29,529
And then in, in the browser, it
will tell you that this is, this is

507
00:37:29,609 --> 00:37:32,109
paragraph element, which is cool.

508
00:37:32,609 --> 00:37:37,839
the other thing in, of area, if we
can use the area level by, it may

509
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:42,829
combining two different elements
or different components into one.

510
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:44,829
so the screen reader will be.

511
00:37:45,224 --> 00:37:51,234
telling to the user, combining, for
example, men, t shirt, and then shop now.

512
00:37:51,474 --> 00:37:52,234
Something like that.

513
00:37:52,734 --> 00:37:56,974
So if you didn't use this,
are you able to buy it?

514
00:37:56,974 --> 00:38:02,454
We were telling the user to the user,
with the screen reader, different fact,

515
00:38:03,184 --> 00:38:11,754
women like men, t shirt, and then the user
need to tap or swipe to the other button.

516
00:38:11,894 --> 00:38:12,584
Then we'll be like.

517
00:38:13,064 --> 00:38:17,184
Telling after the screen
to tell the first one.

518
00:38:18,114 --> 00:38:22,334
So when you're seeing the label,
I will level by it's will be

519
00:38:22,364 --> 00:38:26,844
combining or directly, from
the first to the second one.

520
00:38:27,344 --> 00:38:31,224
It would be like, seamless
to the user with strangers.

521
00:38:31,724 --> 00:38:34,084
Also, you can use the, described by.

522
00:38:34,624 --> 00:38:37,134
It's also good for the input assistant.

523
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:44,539
If you have error and error or any input
assistant in your, form, something like

524
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:46,639
that, you can use the area to say goodbye.

525
00:38:47,139 --> 00:38:52,269
There's a lot other area you can
check, but this is so mess up.

526
00:38:53,179 --> 00:38:58,849
who wants to learn from those
kind of, diagram, But yeah,

527
00:38:59,059 --> 00:39:00,519
I'll make it simple for you.

528
00:39:00,529 --> 00:39:05,269
So you can just scan or learn
more of the area guide in here.

529
00:39:05,769 --> 00:39:09,949
So let's move on to how you audit
the accessibility and your website.

530
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:15,079
So the first thing first, we can
use the manual check and using

531
00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:19,959
the automated check, using the
lighthouse or wave in your browser.

532
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:28,549
If you use the manual check, you can,
check this whole extension in the browser.

533
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:34,419
I prefer using the Chrome instead of
other browser because, Chrome is just

534
00:39:34,429 --> 00:39:36,989
different, built different for everything.

535
00:39:36,989 --> 00:39:38,419
You just work with the Chrome, but.

536
00:39:39,114 --> 00:39:44,334
I don't know this extension is really
helped me when you're building a

537
00:39:44,334 --> 00:39:49,234
website from scratch and then manual
check for the accessibility aspect.

538
00:39:49,784 --> 00:39:55,674
You can use the screen reader for the,
see how, when you serve, visit your

539
00:39:55,674 --> 00:39:59,434
website, navigate your website, then
you can turn on your screen reader.

540
00:39:59,434 --> 00:40:04,414
they're selling the right element,
the right, components, the right.

541
00:40:05,289 --> 00:40:09,769
syntax, the right element for the website,
you can just check the screen reader.

542
00:40:10,269 --> 00:40:14,459
And then the other thing is the
other one is accessibility inside

543
00:40:14,469 --> 00:40:17,059
for the web is, which is good.

544
00:40:17,089 --> 00:40:20,999
Also, it can be, using this extension.

545
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:25,959
This extension can scan through
your website and then see if there's

546
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:28,229
inside for that, for your website.

547
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:35,249
they will telling you, like so many
things that can be, you to fix for you.

548
00:40:35,749 --> 00:40:40,759
And the other thing is X DevTools,
web accessibility testing.

549
00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:44,829
It's also can be, this is like checker.

550
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:49,449
For developers, tester, anything,
anyone, designer in Chrome as well.

551
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:54,689
if you see, if you use this thing, it
will be telling you something like that.

552
00:40:55,569 --> 00:41:00,829
So it will be like telling if there's
your website is a good enough, the

553
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:06,629
total issue in your website will be
telling how many issue in your, website.

554
00:41:07,129 --> 00:41:10,739
And it best on, accessibility aspect.

555
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:17,109
the other thing is accessibility linter,
which is you can combine with your Visual

556
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:20,009
Studio code or any, your code editor.

557
00:41:20,509 --> 00:41:27,119
I use this for my Visual Studio code,
it works well, everything great.

558
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:33,429
imagine if you didn't have enough
resources for your project, let's say

559
00:41:33,809 --> 00:41:38,709
you didn't have enough resource for
your budget, for your teams, you can

560
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:44,849
always use this UI component library
that already support accessibility.

561
00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:49,389
You don't have to build
everything from scratch.

562
00:41:49,509 --> 00:41:53,509
Like you had to add some
type index, everything in

563
00:41:53,509 --> 00:41:55,399
your component, your element.

564
00:41:56,099 --> 00:42:01,759
You can always use this great
component libraries and you can

565
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,429
check, everything works well.

566
00:42:04,469 --> 00:42:11,435
Now it's already worked with, also
use the standard of accessibility.

567
00:42:11,995 --> 00:42:14,215
It can be used to the.

568
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:19,630
any input modalities like keyboard,
it's also works with everything.

569
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:26,210
yeah, you can just check those kind
of library from Chakra UI to Material

570
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:30,140
Bootstrap, Adobe Spectrum to Radix.

571
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:38,400
so yeah, this kind of, website that I used
earlier with the Spectrum, React Spectrum.

572
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,140
Which is good.

573
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:44,870
Maybe I will demonstrate in, in,
after this, after the presentation.

574
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:45,710
Okay.

575
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:51,670
Now we move into the last part,
which is the unit testing.

576
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,780
when you want to try to testing
your component and then you want

577
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:01,375
to also like, have, accessibility
aspect in your testing.

578
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:04,625
You can also follow along,
tips from from this one.

579
00:43:05,135 --> 00:43:12,765
So in order to test your website,
using the accessibility aspect, you

580
00:43:12,765 --> 00:43:18,725
can get rid of, get by tags, get by
ID, something like that, right now

581
00:43:18,725 --> 00:43:21,975
you can change by, testing using.

582
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:27,525
Get by role to find the role of
button and then name that one.

583
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:31,225
So it will tell us the component.

584
00:43:31,725 --> 00:43:37,145
It should be get, it should be
testing, get by the screen and

585
00:43:37,145 --> 00:43:39,065
then, by role of the button.

586
00:43:39,605 --> 00:43:42,905
Then we see the name of
the button is dark mode.

587
00:43:43,405 --> 00:43:49,495
Then we expect that button to have
attribute area press true, which is quite

588
00:43:49,695 --> 00:43:52,995
really accessible for the unit testing.

589
00:43:53,575 --> 00:43:57,995
I'm using unit testing library
from react and also using the jazz.

590
00:43:58,495 --> 00:44:04,175
you can also use the Vitas or any
testing library, any other, testing

591
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:06,785
library like Vitas or jazz, Vess.

592
00:44:07,655 --> 00:44:08,245
Something.

593
00:44:08,745 --> 00:44:13,885
the other thing you can also like, if
you have multiple buttons, you can use

594
00:44:13,915 --> 00:44:16,665
the get all by role, something like that.

595
00:44:17,165 --> 00:44:17,555
Yeah.

596
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:22,765
it's also working well with the
role heading, something like this.

597
00:44:23,425 --> 00:44:28,495
If you're trying to see the
heading a level two, we can just

598
00:44:28,505 --> 00:44:30,235
get viral heading level two.

599
00:44:30,735 --> 00:44:37,675
So when the heading is now changing,
the text will not want, it will,

600
00:44:38,205 --> 00:44:46,575
it won't fail anymore because you
actually are testing those, texts by

601
00:44:46,595 --> 00:44:49,375
the, by its role, not by it's text.

602
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:53,685
So if you combining with the
excellent or earlier, you can.

603
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:55,560
Really great for you.

604
00:44:55,570 --> 00:45:04,930
So, when you forgot everything or
forget, the, accessibility, attribute

605
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:10,050
in your element or your component, it
will be it tells you there's something

606
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:12,420
error in your, component already.

607
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,790
HTML.

608
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:16,830
For example, I didn't provide
the alternative content in here.

609
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:22,470
They will throwing an error, excellent or
ensure image have a man of alternative,

610
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,730
something like that, which is good.

611
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:25,390
Quite good.

612
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:25,820
Great.

613
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:26,110
Great.

614
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:31,560
Or if you work with react as well,
you can use the Aslan plugin.

615
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:31,840
Yes.

616
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,790
X Ali accessibility.

617
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:37,960
You can, this is also good.

618
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:43,845
it's the same like Xlinter, but
it's specifically to JSX format.

619
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:50,880
So if your component using the, dot
JSX, you can use with this as well.

620
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:55,860
the other thing we can use
is testing with Cypress.

621
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,700
this is cool.

622
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:02,190
Actually, this is using combine
it X score and then cyber X.

623
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,770
This is what, this is so much better.

624
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:09,220
I mean, I've already test
this and which is quite good.

625
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:09,240
Yeah.

626
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,040
you can describe and it
contains something like this.

627
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,400
Uh, you can use the
Cypress like this as well.

628
00:46:17,955 --> 00:46:25,095
Cypress, proceed a website and then
inject the X of the, the accessibility.

629
00:46:25,395 --> 00:46:30,015
And then we'll check the entire page for
accessibility issue, something like this.

630
00:46:30,515 --> 00:46:35,845
And then we will tell if there,
an error in your, website.

631
00:46:35,905 --> 00:46:38,410
It'll be, tells you the error itself.

632
00:46:39,105 --> 00:46:41,165
See, wow, this is cool.

633
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:47,595
So yeah, what we can, what all
benefits from all of this, what we

634
00:46:47,595 --> 00:46:55,765
can, we can reflect it to our, our,
movement, our, what we can do earlier.

635
00:46:56,135 --> 00:47:01,835
The benefit is obviously
increasing the audience by making

636
00:47:02,315 --> 00:47:03,825
your website more inclusive.

637
00:47:03,825 --> 00:47:04,285
Okay.

638
00:47:04,565 --> 00:47:05,035
Okay.

639
00:47:05,535 --> 00:47:09,155
And it's also a better user experience.

640
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:10,335
Yeah.

641
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:16,045
Obviously you can get the better
few different view from the user

642
00:47:16,045 --> 00:47:22,135
experience allele and also it can be
improved search engine optimization.

643
00:47:23,045 --> 00:47:31,675
And the fourth is obviously this is the
morally the right thing to do for make

644
00:47:31,705 --> 00:47:34,010
the website is accessible for everyone.

645
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:39,830
And obviously it's also can be a point
potential discrimination lawsuit.

646
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:46,020
So in, in case in different country,
they like putting this, accessibility

647
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,450
things is in serious matters.

648
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:55,890
So if you in those country and you didn't
enough provide enough for your website can

649
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:59,340
be potentially a lawsuit discrimination.

650
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:06,440
yeah, before we end our
presentation, let's take a first

651
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:09,540
to what we can see in here.

652
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:14,730
So we already built some React,
simple crude application.

653
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,940
We see in here already built like
components, the dynamic component

654
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:22,930
that we, see in the presentation.

655
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:28,810
So in here using this one, you
can see we adding as in here.

656
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,700
And then we can, I am for the
dynamic component in here.

657
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:42,300
So if we try to, run it, it would
be like something like this.

658
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:45,960
I'm trying to run this application.

659
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:49,490
So I built this using the react spectrum.

660
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:54,460
The react spectrum is, using
the component from the Adobe

661
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,500
spectrum, which is quite very good.

662
00:48:57,395 --> 00:49:02,745
It's from Adobe and it's work with
all the accessibility things in the

663
00:49:02,755 --> 00:49:07,675
key, in the button, in the other
components that really work with

664
00:49:07,675 --> 00:49:10,175
the accessibility, which is cool.

665
00:49:10,675 --> 00:49:14,495
So yeah, wait, so you can, it's really

666
00:49:14,995 --> 00:49:16,265
still loading.

667
00:49:16,765 --> 00:49:17,195
Okay.

668
00:49:17,465 --> 00:49:18,845
Now we're starting the development.

669
00:49:19,345 --> 00:49:21,205
Now, if you see in here,

670
00:49:21,705 --> 00:49:21,735
Okay.

671
00:49:21,735 --> 00:49:22,575
Let's take a look.

672
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:30,315
the testing that I already mentioned
before here already used to test in here.

673
00:49:30,835 --> 00:49:36,855
See This is, which is not good for
the accessibility aspect and your

674
00:49:36,915 --> 00:49:42,525
testing, which is more good is
using the raw by get by raw in here.

675
00:49:43,025 --> 00:49:43,665
Okay.

676
00:49:44,165 --> 00:49:45,065
Oops.

677
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:46,155
Thing.

678
00:49:46,655 --> 00:49:47,615
Now it's better.

679
00:49:48,115 --> 00:49:48,695
Okay.

680
00:49:48,725 --> 00:49:54,495
Now, if you see in here in
the dome, as you can see this

681
00:49:54,965 --> 00:49:58,015
here, it's just the H as the H.

682
00:49:58,355 --> 00:50:00,125
One heading level one, right?

683
00:50:00,855 --> 00:50:07,295
If we're trying to, change those,
dynamic, and we can change it as, for

684
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:15,565
example, we want to this H heading level
one, we want to change this as a span.

685
00:50:16,095 --> 00:50:19,005
You can also like you're
seeing this as spam.

686
00:50:19,505 --> 00:50:23,595
Now there'll be changing
those to spam as well.

687
00:50:24,095 --> 00:50:25,345
But second,

688
00:50:25,845 --> 00:50:28,625
see, it's also changed now.

689
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:30,475
Oh, which is cool.

690
00:50:30,505 --> 00:50:35,635
In react, you can use dynamic
component to use this as spam.

691
00:50:36,165 --> 00:50:40,415
So it's also, the concept,
works the same like way area.

692
00:50:40,915 --> 00:50:42,905
Or just you can say area.

693
00:50:43,405 --> 00:50:43,765
All right.

694
00:50:43,795 --> 00:50:46,375
And this is, which is cool.

695
00:50:46,415 --> 00:50:48,295
Using the, spectrum.

696
00:50:48,325 --> 00:50:50,155
You can also see in here.

697
00:50:50,895 --> 00:50:53,175
It's, we'll also work with the tab.

698
00:50:53,675 --> 00:51:00,625
So if I, sticky key in here, see this
tab in here, see this tab in here.

699
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:04,725
If you also try to
using the screen reader.

700
00:51:04,725 --> 00:51:04,765
Yeah.

701
00:51:05,415 --> 00:51:08,165
It will also tell us you
the screen reader as well.

702
00:51:08,715 --> 00:51:08,965
yeah,

703
00:51:09,465 --> 00:51:10,285
it's cool, right?

704
00:51:10,785 --> 00:51:12,815
Screen readers also,

705
00:51:13,315 --> 00:51:16,535
it also works well with the screen reader.

706
00:51:17,015 --> 00:51:22,315
For example, in here, I will
adding some extension and then

707
00:51:22,325 --> 00:51:25,315
work it with the ChromeVox alert.

708
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:25,745
Okay.

709
00:51:26,235 --> 00:51:26,655
Alert.

710
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:27,765
Add data.

711
00:51:28,565 --> 00:51:29,025
Title.

712
00:51:30,025 --> 00:51:30,665
Add data.

713
00:51:30,895 --> 00:51:31,245
C.

714
00:51:31,295 --> 00:51:32,755
S D set aside.

715
00:51:33,255 --> 00:51:33,565
Sorry.

716
00:51:34,475 --> 00:51:35,135
Add data.

717
00:51:35,975 --> 00:51:36,495
Button.

718
00:51:36,845 --> 00:51:37,285
Header.

719
00:51:37,575 --> 00:51:38,885
List with four items.

720
00:51:39,255 --> 00:51:39,645
About.

721
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:40,945
Dark mode.

722
00:51:41,785 --> 00:51:42,265
Button.

723
00:51:42,765 --> 00:51:50,027
This works well with all, with
all the kind of, websites.

724
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:52,417
All components works
with the accessibility.

725
00:51:52,917 --> 00:51:55,327
yeah, that's our demo today.

726
00:51:55,827 --> 00:52:01,797
So resource in order to learn, if you want
to learn more, you can check those links.

727
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:07,267
You can see the W3 org
or in Google Chrome.

728
00:52:07,367 --> 00:52:13,887
Also, you can check, or you can
check the Li, 101 development, or

729
00:52:13,887 --> 00:52:17,527
if you, lazy with all this links.

730
00:52:17,547 --> 00:52:19,787
I made the repository.

731
00:52:20,497 --> 00:52:27,157
I put all the links on those
links to this repository.

732
00:52:27,497 --> 00:52:29,807
You can always check on my repository.

733
00:52:29,957 --> 00:52:31,327
I made it public.

734
00:52:31,397 --> 00:52:34,797
So yeah, it is easy to follow along.

735
00:52:35,297 --> 00:52:43,272
And in summary, accessibility is not
just how you adding some Alternative

736
00:52:43,392 --> 00:52:48,652
text to your image, adding some type
index to your div is more than that.

737
00:52:48,682 --> 00:52:49,842
It's beyond than that.

738
00:52:50,172 --> 00:52:56,002
Accessibility is, really making
sure about the content and the

739
00:52:56,002 --> 00:52:59,692
website of your, website itself.

740
00:53:00,332 --> 00:53:04,552
Really making sure your content
and the website itself, it

741
00:53:04,552 --> 00:53:07,572
can be, use, can be accessed.

742
00:53:08,332 --> 00:53:11,612
To various environments and abilities.

743
00:53:12,112 --> 00:53:14,382
So it's our job.

744
00:53:14,572 --> 00:53:16,582
our homework is not done yet.

745
00:53:16,602 --> 00:53:20,372
There's plenty of things that
we should do more, explore more.

746
00:53:20,522 --> 00:53:23,732
One of those is the accessibility itself.

747
00:53:24,232 --> 00:53:26,712
yeah, thank you for the attention.

748
00:53:27,212 --> 00:53:30,972
if you want to connect once
again with me, you can follow

749
00:53:30,972 --> 00:53:33,262
along this link, social media.
