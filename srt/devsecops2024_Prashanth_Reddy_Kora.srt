1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:01,220
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:07,569
It's an honor to be in Con 42, and
I'm here to discuss a topic that is

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:12,190
shaping the future of technology,
multi cloud and hybrid cloud

4
00:00:12,239 --> 00:00:14,470
architectures in data management.

5
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:19,914
in this presentation, we will explore
the benefits, market growth, challenges,

6
00:00:19,974 --> 00:00:25,254
and best practices, and understand why
they matter in today's digital age.

7
00:00:25,754 --> 00:00:31,724
according to Gartner, by 2025,
95 percent of the digital

8
00:00:31,754 --> 00:00:33,274
workloads will be cloud native.

9
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:38,999
So IDC predicts the global data
sphere will reach a staggering

10
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:41,259
175 zettabytes by then.

11
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:47,009
So these figures emphasize the growing
importance of scalable cloud solutions

12
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,409
to handle the immense data demands.

13
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:55,019
So we'll see what are the multi
cloud and hybrid cloud architectures.

14
00:00:55,699 --> 00:01:00,369
So multi cloud refers to using two
or more cloud providers, public or

15
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:02,429
private, to distribute workloads.

16
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,889
it helps to avoid the vendor lock
in and enhances the redundancy.

17
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:12,809
on the other hand, whereas, hybrid
cloud integrates private or public

18
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:17,649
clouds with on prem infrastructures,
offering the flexibility in data storage

19
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:23,539
and processing, these strategies,
which are vital for optimizing the

20
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:29,009
performance, reliability, and compliance
key for pillars for modern businesses.

21
00:01:29,809 --> 00:01:34,659
So we'll see the benefits of
multi cloud architectures.

22
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,699
So multi cloud strategies
bring four key advantages.

23
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:41,169
So one, one is the redundancy.

24
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,279
So the redundancy is nothing but
distributing of workloads across

25
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:50,199
providers, ensures a business continuity.

26
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:54,779
even if one provider faces the
downtime, let's say in effect, 63

27
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:56,794
percent of the organization reports Oh!

28
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,194
Improved business continuity.

29
00:01:59,474 --> 00:02:02,624
And the second one would
be the vendor flexibility.

30
00:02:02,814 --> 00:02:08,214
So this approach allows choosing the
best services based on the work needs.

31
00:02:08,354 --> 00:02:14,884
For example, AWS for scalability,
Google cloud for AI and Azure

32
00:02:14,894 --> 00:02:16,614
for the enterprise applications.

33
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,864
the third advantage is
the cost optimization.

34
00:02:21,764 --> 00:02:25,304
Competition between the providers
can lead to a significant savings.

35
00:02:25,864 --> 00:02:31,754
45 percent of businesses, leveraging
multi cloud report cost reductions.

36
00:02:32,504 --> 00:02:35,524
the fourth one will be,
performance enhancements.

37
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:42,594
workload distribution across, providers,
which ensures the optimal performance.

38
00:02:43,094 --> 00:02:49,144
So coming to the growth of multicloud
market, the multicloud market is booming.

39
00:02:49,324 --> 00:02:56,874
So valued, I would say probably 15
plus billion dollars in 2020, it's

40
00:02:56,884 --> 00:03:06,314
projected to reach 44 billion, maybe
by 2027 growing at a robust at 18%.

41
00:03:06,814 --> 00:03:08,284
So this growth is.

42
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:10,649
Driven by increasing I.

43
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:10,879
T.

44
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,479
Complexity and the demand of
resilient infrastructure, providing

45
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:21,059
the relevance of multi cloud
strategies and across the industries.

46
00:03:21,774 --> 00:03:27,824
So the hybrid cloud architecture
overview, the hybrid cloud combines

47
00:03:27,884 --> 00:03:32,834
on prem data centers, private clouds
and public clouds into one system.

48
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:39,404
So it serves as a bridge for a base
businesses, transitioning legacy

49
00:03:39,404 --> 00:03:44,174
systems to cloud environments while
keeping critical data on prem or

50
00:03:44,194 --> 00:03:48,994
a private like with the 87 percent
of it leaders favoring this model.

51
00:03:49,704 --> 00:03:54,394
It's no wonder hybrid cloud
adoption is expected to grow by

52
00:03:54,454 --> 00:03:56,974
39 percent in the next few years.

53
00:03:57,734 --> 00:04:01,654
we'll see the advantages of the
hybrid cloud for data management.

54
00:04:02,064 --> 00:04:07,414
I would say three standout benefits
of hybrid cloud includes, the first

55
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,334
one will be the data sovereignty.

56
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:14,794
Sensitive data can remain on prem
or the private clouds to meet the

57
00:04:14,814 --> 00:04:20,564
compliance needs like GDPR or any
HIPAA while non sensitive data

58
00:04:20,564 --> 00:04:22,934
leverages public cloud resources.

59
00:04:23,704 --> 00:04:28,034
So coming to the second advantage,
I would say scalability with on

60
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,854
demand public cloud resources.

61
00:04:30,114 --> 00:04:34,714
Scaling operation becomes like
four and a half times faster

62
00:04:34,754 --> 00:04:36,294
compared to the traditional setups.

63
00:04:36,794 --> 00:04:40,184
The third point would be the
legacy system integration.

64
00:04:40,874 --> 00:04:46,404
It allows businesses to modernize
gradually integrating legacy

65
00:04:46,404 --> 00:04:48,704
systems with cloud environments.

66
00:04:49,204 --> 00:04:52,774
next one will be the growth
of the hybrid cloud market.

67
00:04:53,064 --> 00:04:56,494
the hybrid cloud market is
expanding significantly.

68
00:04:56,654 --> 00:05:01,884
I would say expected to grow
from, 73 billion dollars in 2020

69
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,885
to 171 billion dollars by 2025.

70
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:09,205
cost efficiency,
scalability, and compliance.

71
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,330
Needs are major drivers of this growth.

72
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:20,660
Additionally, SMBs are adopting hybrid
cloud solution to access advanced

73
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,750
technologies without any upfront cost.

74
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:31,164
we'll see the next one, next slide is
coming to the multicloud and hybrid cloud.

75
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:36,155
So despite of all these benefits,
there are a couple of challenges

76
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:37,245
I would like to present.

77
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:41,725
So first one is a data integration
differences in architecture,

78
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:44,085
making integrating data complex.

79
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:48,974
The second one would be the security
risk in the sense like when, with the

80
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:53,695
data spreads across the environments,
ensuring robust security is critical.

81
00:05:54,085 --> 00:05:57,645
The third challenges
would be the skill gaps.

82
00:05:58,355 --> 00:06:00,585
So finding skilled professionals.

83
00:06:01,285 --> 00:06:03,945
remains a hurdle for many organizations.

84
00:06:04,515 --> 00:06:10,735
So we'll see another, a couple more
challenges in a cloud strategies.

85
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:15,904
So compliance and the cost
management, add to the list.

86
00:06:15,985 --> 00:06:20,374
For example, like 53 percent of the
organizations struggle with evolving

87
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:26,594
compliance policies across multiple
environments without proper governance.

88
00:06:26,945 --> 00:06:29,205
Cloud costs can spiral out of control.

89
00:06:29,225 --> 00:06:34,725
So interestingly, the global data privacy
market is projected to reach 83 billion

90
00:06:34,734 --> 00:06:40,525
by 2027, reflecting RISE compliance needs.

91
00:06:40,974 --> 00:06:45,284
So I would like to present a
best practice of implementation

92
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,454
to overcome these challenges.

93
00:06:47,764 --> 00:06:52,764
Business should adopt best practices
such as like implementing Strong

94
00:06:52,774 --> 00:06:57,124
data governance policies to ensure
data integrity and security.

95
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:02,429
using, data integration tools like ETL
and virtualization to streamline these

96
00:07:02,429 --> 00:07:08,599
operations, and adopting cloud agnostic
technologies to avoid vendor lock in.

97
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:14,639
practicing continuous monitoring to
optimize cloud performance, cost, or

98
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:18,899
any such kind of potential savings
of which, which are up to 30%.

99
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:23,550
to sum up the multi cloud and
hybrid cloud architectures, Provide

100
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,890
businesses with the unmatched
flexibility, scalability, and security.

101
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:33,920
while challenges like integration security
and compliance exist, the advantages

102
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,040
would be, which will outweigh the hurdles.

103
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,470
by leveraging the governance,
cloud, agnostic tools, and

104
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,605
continuous optimizations,
organizations can fully realize the

105
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,355
potential of these architectures.

106
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,540
As we move on, into a data driven era.

107
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:56,720
those who master these strategies will
undoubtedly lead in innovation and growth.

108
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,630
thank you for your time and attention.

109
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:03,510
Let's embrace the opportunities,
from multi cloud and hybrid cloud

110
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,700
architectures, and bring and unlock any
new possibilities for the data management.

111
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,040
Thank you.
