1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,429
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,699 --> 00:00:07,070
I'm Dhruvesh Talati, a senior software engineer
with experience in cloud infrastructure

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:12,830
and DevSecOps Engineering, and I'm glad
to be here at Con 42 Cube Native 2025.

4
00:00:13,459 --> 00:00:16,430
Today I want to talk about
something that's becoming

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,440
increasingly important in the world

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:24,169
we live in building cloud native systems
that are resilient by design, especially

7
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:26,150
for crisis response and recovery.

8
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:30,650
Instead of just reacting when
things go wrong, what if we could

9
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,160
design systems that are ready
for disruption from the start?

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,929
In this session, we will look
at how distributed, elastic, and

11
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:43,640
highly available cloud native
architectures can help organizations

12
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:48,715
stay operational during emergencies
and bounce back faster afterward.

13
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:53,145
If you look at the world right now
with increasingly complicated and

14
00:00:53,145 --> 00:00:58,125
frequent events like climate disasters,
cyber attacks, and health emergencies,

15
00:00:58,665 --> 00:01:02,505
it is evident that the traditional
approaches are no longer sufficient.

16
00:01:03,074 --> 00:01:07,155
The traditional on-premise
infrastructures that many organizations

17
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,555
still depend on are too slow.

18
00:01:10,365 --> 00:01:15,435
When a crisis hits, they take too longer
to recover and constantly break down.

19
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:20,025
This simply isn't sustainable
when the threats are this serious.

20
00:01:20,685 --> 00:01:24,914
The limits of these older systems
create big vulnerabilities that

21
00:01:24,914 --> 00:01:28,995
can quickly spread and cause
problems across entire industries.

22
00:01:29,595 --> 00:01:34,424
At this point, resilience isn't
just an IT issue, it's a matter

23
00:01:34,454 --> 00:01:36,704
of global and societal stability.

24
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:42,585
We absolutely need infrastructure
that can flex scale and recover

25
00:01:42,794 --> 00:01:44,384
as fast as modern crisis demands.

26
00:01:44,884 --> 00:01:47,704
So what does this new
infrastructure need to do?

27
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:51,319
I believe there are three
pillars to true resilience.

28
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:56,659
First, uninterrupted availability
during an age of constant crisis.

29
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,489
This isn't a choice.

30
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:02,329
Basic services ranging from
medicine to emergency calls,

31
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:04,729
need, near perfect uptime.

32
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:11,479
That is 99.99% availability to keep
people alive and maintain social order.

33
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:17,750
Second dynamic scalability crises
are not predictable and can cause

34
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,179
stupendous, unplanned surges in demand.

35
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:24,950
Our infrastructures must have the
agility to dynamically scale up

36
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,359
in seconds, absorbing 10 times
capacity increases in minutes.

37
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:34,820
This presents, a stark deviation from
the latency prone and operationally rigid

38
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,940
nature of legacy systems, which struggle
to adapt efficiently to dynamic condition.

39
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:44,539
And third, seamless interoperability.

40
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:49,640
Effective crisis response requires
coordinated action by different

41
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,469
organizations, public, private
sector, and international aid groups.

42
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:58,939
Resilience rests on effective
realtime collaboration, and

43
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,799
sharing of data without delay.

44
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:05,749
This is not merely an upgrade, but
a foundational strategic imperative.

45
00:03:06,184 --> 00:03:11,374
To build the resilient and adaptive
infrastructure that our future demands.

46
00:03:11,874 --> 00:03:13,434
So how do we build this?

47
00:03:13,614 --> 00:03:16,734
We build resilience with
cloud native architectures.

48
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,674
First, microservices architecture.

49
00:03:20,274 --> 00:03:23,969
This pattern releases developer from
the limitation of monolithic approach.

50
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,699
It deconstructs complex applications into
small, independently deployable units.

51
00:03:30,614 --> 00:03:34,124
When a service fails, it does
not take the entire system down,

52
00:03:34,574 --> 00:03:38,504
which provides unprecedented
resilience and quick recovery.

53
00:03:39,314 --> 00:03:41,714
Second container orchestration.

54
00:03:42,344 --> 00:03:47,504
We employ tools like Kubernetes
to automatically and dynamically

55
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:48,854
manage our infrastructure.

56
00:03:49,484 --> 00:03:55,424
This provides us with dynamic scaling,
self feeling, and performance optimization

57
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:57,524
across distributed environments.

58
00:03:58,124 --> 00:04:02,924
Keeping your services up and
running and perform optimally and

59
00:04:02,924 --> 00:04:05,084
third infrastructure as a code.

60
00:04:05,594 --> 00:04:09,854
By coding and managing our entire
infrastructure with version controlled

61
00:04:09,854 --> 00:04:14,744
code, we eliminate human error and
deliver consistent, predictable

62
00:04:14,744 --> 00:04:16,994
deployment in any cloud or region.

63
00:04:17,804 --> 00:04:23,914
This accelerates provisioning considerably
and enhances security beyond the roots.

64
00:04:24,335 --> 00:04:27,544
We use specific distributed
resilience patterns to build

65
00:04:28,205 --> 00:04:30,244
actually fault tolerance systems.

66
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:35,314
The circuit breaker pattern shields
your system from catastrophic crashes.

67
00:04:35,825 --> 00:04:40,835
It detects and isolates failing
services to cut off cascading failures,

68
00:04:41,284 --> 00:04:46,534
leaving core functionality intact
and operational timeout controls.

69
00:04:47,104 --> 00:04:51,179
It prevents the resource exhaustion
condition by actively terminating

70
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:53,219
long labeled or hung requests.

71
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:57,185
This keeps the entire system
stable and allows for a

72
00:04:57,185 --> 00:04:59,195
smooth, quick user experience.

73
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:06,065
Even under high load retry and back off
is a master of transient network issues.

74
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:11,674
It uses intelligent retry methods
with exponential back off to retry

75
00:05:11,705 --> 00:05:16,330
unsuccessful operations gracefully
without overwhelming your infrastructure.

76
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,210
And finally, bulkhead isolation.

77
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:25,669
Prevents critical services from competing
for resources with resource partitioning.

78
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,200
Failure in one service can't
exhaust the resources that your

79
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,789
most critical operations depend
upon assuring the continuity,

80
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,919
availability, and performance.

81
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:42,400
One of the biggest benefits of cloud
native architectures is that they are,

82
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,919
they inherently have elastic scaling.

83
00:05:45,489 --> 00:05:47,979
They offer unpowered resiliency.

84
00:05:48,324 --> 00:05:54,504
With dynamic resource scaling, this allows
organizations to automatically ingest

85
00:05:54,564 --> 00:06:00,744
massive traffic spikes in a disaster
without having to incur the cost of over

86
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:02,694
provisioning pricing infrastructure.

87
00:06:03,354 --> 00:06:08,004
This is supported by three key
abilities, vigilant real-time monitoring.

88
00:06:08,574 --> 00:06:14,004
We have a continuous pulse on the system
with realtime insight into performance

89
00:06:14,004 --> 00:06:17,454
data, user behavior, and emerging threats.

90
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:20,199
Which enables a proactive approach.

91
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:25,569
Smart automated scaling our
infrastructures are able to scale up

92
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:31,179
or down automatically using dynamic
thresholds and predicted analytics

93
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:36,549
optimally adapting to changing demands
and optimize load distribution.

94
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:41,530
Smart traffic routing, maximizes
workload distribution between

95
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,179
availability zones and regions.

96
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:48,900
Bypassing bottlenecks and providing
maximum performance beyond

97
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,890
scaling uninterrupted service is
maintained by building for high

98
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,840
availability with redundancy.

99
00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:00,510
We utilize strategic multi-region
deployment to safeguard mission

100
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:04,830
critical applications by
distributing infrastructure across

101
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,569
geographically distant locations.

102
00:07:07,455 --> 00:07:12,765
We provide unflinching continuity of
service even in case of local disasters

103
00:07:12,945 --> 00:07:15,284
or catastrophic infrastructure failures.

104
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:21,405
This architecture uses seamless failover
through active configurations, which

105
00:07:21,405 --> 00:07:24,314
enables seamless zero downtime failover.

106
00:07:24,884 --> 00:07:30,074
Strong data integrity is provided with
advanced data application technologies

107
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:36,314
that provides strong consistency in
all regions and efficient traffic flow.

108
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,689
Is achieved with intelligent
cross region traffic steering.

109
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,489
This forward looking paradigm
transforms disaster recovery into a

110
00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:49,259
proactive capability from a reactive
scramble, making it a seamless

111
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:52,109
always on experience for end users.

112
00:07:52,609 --> 00:07:56,119
The integration of artificial
intelligence in cloud native

113
00:07:56,119 --> 00:08:01,429
architectures is revolutionizing crisis
response by enhancing situational

114
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:02,959
awareness and predictability.

115
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:05,989
AI enables predictive analytics.

116
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:11,779
Machine learning algorithms can analyze
historic trends and real-time information

117
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:17,179
to foresee crisis escalation and resource
requirements before they turn critical.

118
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:20,929
We may also get automated
decision support.

119
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:26,149
AI systems provide evidence-based
recommendations on resource

120
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:30,529
allocation, evacuation routes,
and response prioritization

121
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,689
under high stress situations.

122
00:08:33,244 --> 00:08:35,944
And finally, real time data

123
00:08:35,944 --> 00:08:40,924
Fusion, AI can combine different
sources of data from social

124
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:45,665
media and satellite imagery to
sensor networks into consolidated

125
00:08:45,665 --> 00:08:48,454
operation intelligence dashboards.

126
00:08:48,954 --> 00:08:53,214
In cases of degraded central
cloud connectivity, edge computing

127
00:08:53,244 --> 00:08:55,254
offers edge site resilience.

128
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:58,339
Assured operational
continuity is a key benefit.

129
00:08:59,214 --> 00:09:04,314
Edge Sites guarantee the uninterrupted
operation of vital systems enabling

130
00:09:04,314 --> 00:09:08,604
critical functionality even when
Central Cloud connectivity is lost.

131
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:14,064
This foundational autonomy ensures
resilience in the direct scenarios.

132
00:09:14,814 --> 00:09:20,035
Edge computing offers life savings
speed two local processing offers

133
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:23,844
less than a hundred milliseconds
near realtime responsiveness.

134
00:09:24,444 --> 00:09:27,834
This is what's needed in
life critical applications.

135
00:09:28,165 --> 00:09:33,864
Such as emergency and instant
medicine monitoring where differences

136
00:09:33,925 --> 00:09:36,354
are all in the millisecond order.

137
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:41,874
It also enables unburdening network
infrastructure with server side

138
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:46,410
intelligence and data processing
locally at the data's point of origin.

139
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,260
This mitigates network saturation and
ensures that critical communication

140
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,430
channels remain operational and
performant during high demand.

141
00:09:56,925 --> 00:09:58,124
Crisis scenarios.

142
00:09:58,624 --> 00:10:03,394
In a crisis situation, perimeter
security frameworks fall apart.

143
00:10:03,844 --> 00:10:07,444
That's why a zero trust
security model is critical.

144
00:10:08,165 --> 00:10:13,114
This architecture is built on three
pillars, continuous verification.

145
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:18,999
It enforces intense continuation,
verification upon all users,

146
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:21,560
devices, and services everywhere.

147
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:27,290
This eradicates implicit trust
and defeats unauthorized access.

148
00:10:27,469 --> 00:10:34,189
During dynamic crisis scenarios, strict
least pur privilege, each user and each

149
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:38,839
system possess just exactly the rights
necessary to carry out their function.

150
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,329
This restricts lateral movement
almost entirely and reduces the

151
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:46,369
effect of potential compromise.

152
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,560
UBI Twitters encryption.

153
00:10:49,175 --> 00:10:54,765
It offers end-to-end encryption while
data is in transit at rest and processing,

154
00:10:55,395 --> 00:11:00,795
your sensitive data remains protected even
when the nearby surroundings are hacked.

155
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:05,285
Moving to a crisis, resilience
enabled cloud native architecture

156
00:11:05,494 --> 00:11:06,155
does not occur overnight.

157
00:11:06,655 --> 00:11:12,350
A phase migration method is a paramount
to success, causing the least disruption

158
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,939
while developing capabilities.

159
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:19,969
It begins with assessment and planning,
which involves the evaluation of

160
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:24,770
existing infrastructure and the
specification of the resilience needs.

161
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,680
Second, a proof of concept phase
entails running pilot projects on

162
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,119
non-critical systems in order to
prove the architecture decisions.

163
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:38,510
Next, start the core service migration.

164
00:11:39,229 --> 00:11:42,410
Moving code services with
known patterns and practices.

165
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,089
Lastly, integration and optimization.

166
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:50,499
Linking your legacy and cloud
native applications with continuous

167
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:51,999
performance optimization.

168
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:56,939
Effective management of a crisis
also demands unwavering government

169
00:11:56,999 --> 00:12:02,939
agencies, business community, and global
cooperation across partner organizations.

170
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,264
Cloud native architecture
is the enabler here.

171
00:12:06,764 --> 00:12:10,904
They also maintain shared infrastructure
via shared cloud platforms.

172
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:16,814
This minimizes duplicate work and
provides instant scalable resource

173
00:12:16,814 --> 00:12:18,644
allocation during emergencies.

174

00:14:13,944 --> 00:14:19,044
creating coordinated response capabilities
that can adapt to evolving threats.

202
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:24,609
This result is just not technical
resilience, but societal resilience.

203
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:30,999
It creates communi communities that
can withstand adapt to and recover

204
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:32,769

Offers crisis resilience
possibilities such as never before.

209
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:55,139
The question isn't whether
organizations will adopt these

210
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:59,099
approaches, but how quickly they
can transform their infrastructure.

211
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:03,979
I urge you to start with resilience
first, design principles, build

212
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,479
distributed, elastic and self-healing
systems from the ground hub.

213
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:13,399
Invest in cross-sector partnerships
to create interoperable platforms

214
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:15,619
that strengthen collective resilience.

215
00:15:16,489 --> 00:15:18,439

216
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,989
Treat resilience as an evolving
capability, not a one-time implementation.

217
00:15:24,859 --> 00:15:29,089
The time for resilient
infrastructure is now The cost of

218
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,880
inaction grows with every crisis.
