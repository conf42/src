1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,980
Welcome everyone.

2
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:04,110
Thank you for joining today's
session on innovative approaches

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,810
to security, micro segmentations,
impact on cloud environments.

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,389
My name is Venkata Nethinuri and it's a
pleasure to be part of cloud native 2025.

5
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:16,629
Over the next 40 minutes, we will
explore how micro segmentation is

6
00:00:16,629 --> 00:00:18,869
changing the game in cloud security.

7
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:23,019
By end of this talk, you will
understand why traditional security

8
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:28,129
models need to evolve and how micro
segmentation can significantly bluster

9
00:00:28,139 --> 00:00:30,279
our defenses in cloud environments.

10
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,849
Without any delay, let's proceed further.

11
00:00:33,349 --> 00:00:37,410
Before jumping into the actual topic
of micro segmentation, let's take

12
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,289
a step back and see cyber security
challenges in the cloud environments.

13
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:44,819
Modern cloud architectures are
highly dynamic, applications

14
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:49,029
and data spread across different
data centers and multiple clouds.

15
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:52,789
This brings increased complexity
and new vulnerabilities.

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,729
Traditional security relied on a
strong perimeter, like a firewall at

17
00:00:58,779 --> 00:01:03,890
the network edge, but the cloud era,
the concept of a fixed is fading away.

18
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,870
Now, the reason because this is because
attackers are continuously finding

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,309
ways to pass the perimeter defenses.

20
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:16,489
And once they are inside too often,
they can laterally move to other

21
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:17,949
systems without being detected.

22
00:01:17,949 --> 00:01:19,139
And that's a huge risk.

23
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:25,330
So we must evolve to, we must evolve
beyond just the perimeter defense.

24
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:31,200
while firewalls and border security
are still necessary, they don't, like

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,400
they are not sufficient to protect,
they're not sufficient on their own

26
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,240
to protect the cloud environments.

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,210
Think of this as securing a building.

28
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,880
It's not enough to guard the front door.

29
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,080
And if once inside every room or
vault is wide open, we need inter

30
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,100
barrier, internal barriers as walls.

31
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,450
This is where micro
segmentation comes into picture.

32
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:56,490
Microsegmentation is an innovative
approach that breaks the cloud network

33
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:02,510
into many small and isolated segments,
each with its own security controls.

34
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,140
So instead of assuming that everything
inside our network is secured and trusted,

35
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:11,740
microsegmentation enforces trust nothing
and verify everything strategy internally.

36
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,079
This aligns perfectly with
the zero trust security model.

37
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,400
Now, the objective of this session is
to understand what microsegmentation is

38
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,270
and how it differs from the traditional
network segmentation and discuss why

39
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,780
it is crucial for cloud security and
how it addresses the challenges like

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,880
insider threats and lateral movement.

41
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,810
We will also go over the components
or key components and best practices

42
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,660
for implementing microsegmentation,
in cloud environments, especially

43
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,410
with a few real world examples
as well, case studies as well.

44
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,890
And, last but not the least,
we look at the future trends,

45
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,640
including how automation and AI
can enhance micro segmentation.

46
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:55,630
So overall, by the end of this session,
both technical and non technical audiences

47
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,970
we have in the, in today's, discussion
should have a clear idea of what micro

48
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,560
segmentation impact on cloud environment,
cloud security, and, Get some practical

49
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,580
insights on using it effectively.

50
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,960
what actually is micro segmentation?

51
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,180
so micro segmentation, is a granular
security strategy that isolates

52
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,510
workloads and applications within
the network to minimize the risk

53
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,110
of lateral movement by attackers.

54
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,087
Now, unlike the traditional network
segmentation which divides the

55
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:30,280
network into large sections using
VLANs, firewalls, or subnets.

56
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,440
Microsegmentation operates at a
more refined level, securing the

57
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,740
individual workloads, containers, or
even, specific application processes.

58
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,730
This ensures that even if the
attacker gains access to a part

59
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,570
of the network, they cannot easily
move into other critical systems.

60
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,800
The key principle of the
microsegmentation is that to apply

61
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,630
identity based least privilege access
policies to control network traffic.

62
00:03:56,295 --> 00:03:57,615
between the workloads.

63
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:02,265
instead of solely relying on the IP
addresses, instead of solely relying

64
00:04:02,265 --> 00:04:06,755
on the IP addresses, micro segmentation
uses contextual information like,

65
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:11,415
application type, user identity,
workload tags, and security

66
00:04:11,415 --> 00:04:17,805
posture, etc. to determine whether a
connection should be allowed or not.

67
00:04:18,205 --> 00:04:23,295
This perfectly aligns with zero trust
security, zero trust security model.

68
00:04:23,855 --> 00:04:28,575
which assumes that there no and
that no entity inside the network

69
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,495
should be trusted by default.

70
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:33,635
Now, how does micro segmentation work?

71
00:04:34,075 --> 00:04:38,655
Now, how it works is basically micro
segmentation works by enforcing

72
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:43,635
strict access control between
different segments of the network.

73
00:04:44,135 --> 00:04:46,925
Now, it can be implemented
through host based firewalls,

74
00:04:47,055 --> 00:04:48,365
hypervisor based controls.

75
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,470
Cloud security groups, or software
defined network solutions.

76
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,990
These mechanisms basically allow
organizations to define and enforce

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,470
security policies dynamically,
ensuring the workloads can only

78
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,080
communicate with authorized services.

79
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,260
For example, let's say a segmentation
policy might permit a web server

80
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,420
to talk to application server, but
not directly a database server.

81
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,440
This reduces the risk of data breaches.

82
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,610
drastically, especially coming to
the cloud and hybrid environments.

83
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,960
Microsegmentation is particularly
useful as traditional network

84
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,750
perimeters no longer exist.

85
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,300
Yeah, they no longer exist because cloud
workloads are dynamic and static firewall

86
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,440
rules may not be effective in controlling
the traffic cloud native security

87
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,260
controls like AWS security groups.

88
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,140
Azure, network security groups, NSGs,
or Kubernetes network policies allow

89
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:50,230
organizations to implement software
defined micro segmentation, ensuring

90
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,110
basically this ensures that the
security policies follow workloads,

91
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,120
even if they move or scale up or down.

92
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,910
Now, next let's move and go ahead and
look at a sample implementation of

93
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,220
a micro segmentation architecture.

94
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:11,270
So if you see in this, if you see
in this diagram, this basically,

95
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,880
demonstrates a micro segmentation
architecture where network resources

96
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,160
are divided into isolated segments
micro segment 1 and micro segment 2.

97
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,580
The purpose is to limit unauthorized
communication and prevent lateral

98
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,630
movement of the thread, of the threads.

99
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,540
Each micro segment contains three
layers, web layer, application layer,

100
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,210
and database layer, representing
our traditional enterprise, typical

101
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,630
enterprise network structure.

102
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:41,990
This implementation of micro segmentation
ensures we can see that only authorized

103
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,540
communication happens between the
tiers, reducing the security risk.

104
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,850
Now, the logical routers and
perimeter firewalls provide

105
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,880
high level of network severity.

106
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:54,635
But the real strength of micro
segmentation, as you can see, comes

107
00:06:54,635 --> 00:06:58,075
from the next generation firewalls
placed at each segment's boundary

108
00:06:58,075 --> 00:07:00,445
enforcing strict security policies.

109
00:07:00,945 --> 00:07:05,665
with this, basically that, traffic
between the micro segments is tightly

110
00:07:05,665 --> 00:07:09,665
controlled, meaning that even if
the attacker compromises a workload

111
00:07:09,945 --> 00:07:13,195
in one segment, they cannot freely
move to the other segment without

112
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:14,935
passing through the security controls.

113
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,390
as we discussed earlier as well, this
security model aligns with the zero

114
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:23,380
trust model, ensuring all traffic is
verified and the security policies

115
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,360
enforce least privilege access between
the different applications and components.

116
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,400
yeah, let's go ahead and see what are all
the key differences between traditional

117
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,710
security, versus micro segmentation.

118
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,550
Now, for decades, traditional network
security models have relied heavily

119
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,630
on perimeter based defense, perimeter
defense mechanisms, such as firewalls,

120
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,560
intrusion detection systems, and VPNs.

121
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,960
The goal of the perimeter security is to
block unauthorized access at the network

122
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,090
boundary itself, assuming that, everything
inside the network is inherently trusted.

123
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:00,450
While this approach worked well in
static and on premise environments,

124
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,440
today's modern cloud architecture
and sophisticated cyber threats

125
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:07,190
have rendered this as insufficient.

126
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:11,900
The biggest limitation of perimeter
security is that once the attacker gains

127
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,950
access past the firewall, they can often
move freely within the internet network.

128
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:22,140
This is because traditional networks
are flat, meaning, The systems inside

129
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:25,060
the perimeter have unrestricted
communication with each other.

130
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,930
let's say if an attacker exploits
a vulnerability in one system, they

131
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,910
can laterally traverse to other
critical systems escalating their

132
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,560
attack and accessing sensitive data.

133
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:40,570
This type of lateral, this type of
movement, we call it as lateral movement,

134
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,640
a key tactic used in, various, Attacks
basically such as advanced persistent

135
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,990
threats, APTs we call, and random attack,
ransomware attacks, and insider threats.

136
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:55,230
Now, we have seen, as we have seen
in the previous slide in the image,

137
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:58,260
let's say we have a cloud hosted
e commerce application with three

138
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,580
types, web tier, application tier, and
database tier, with micro segmentation.

139
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:08,100
If a attacker, if a hacker exploits a
vulnerability in the web server, they

140
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,505
might be able to move laterally into
the application and Database starts

141
00:09:12,545 --> 00:09:16,585
gaining access to, sensitive customer
data without the micro segmentation.

142
00:09:16,905 --> 00:09:21,335
However, with micro segmentation,
each tier is strictly isolated

143
00:09:21,335 --> 00:09:22,785
with well defined access policies.

144
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:27,285
This compromised web server
cannot directly affect or connect

145
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:31,125
to the database, preventing
unauthorized access, even if the

146
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,295
attacker is inside the network.

147
00:09:33,175 --> 00:09:37,225
This segmented approach provides
multiple security benefits.

148
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,860
A few of the key benefits are prevention
of lateral movement, minimized attack

149
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,575
surveys, damage containment, and
compliance, and it also helps with

150
00:09:48,075 --> 00:09:52,665
compliance and governance like meeting,
meeting with regulatory compliance

151
00:09:52,695 --> 00:10:00,145
PCI, DSA, CIPA and GDPR by basically
ensuring that the secure workloads,

152
00:10:00,205 --> 00:10:01,425
sensitive workloads are isolated.

153
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:07,730
Now, in the cloud and hybrid, security,
as micro segmentation is adaptable

154
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,950
and to dynamic and software defined
environments where workloads are

155
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,350
more frequently move up and down.

156
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,340
it's a key advantage of
the micro segmentation.

157
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:24,520
that's all let's move on to the
next slide where we have key

158
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,980
benefits of micro segmentation.

159
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:29,945
I feel we have discussed the key
benefits in the previous slide, but

160
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,925
let's look at a, let's look at, let's
look at the key benefits briefly.

161
00:10:34,785 --> 00:10:36,835
the first one is granular access control.

162
00:10:37,175 --> 00:10:37,575
Okay.

163
00:10:37,955 --> 00:10:43,395
Now we can tailor the security policies
at the workload level, ensuring that

164
00:10:43,395 --> 00:10:47,675
only authorized users and systems
can access the specific resources.

165
00:10:48,175 --> 00:10:52,485
With this, we are reducing the attack
surface by isolating the workloads.

166
00:10:52,815 --> 00:10:59,295
micro segmentation minimizes the potential
targets for the attacker and, overall we

167
00:10:59,295 --> 00:11:02,535
are preventing the lateral movement, okay?

168
00:11:02,615 --> 00:11:08,975
So if a segment is compromised,
attackers cannot easily, move across

169
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,595
other segments within the network.

170
00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:13,025
So these benefits, okay?

171
00:11:13,065 --> 00:11:18,215
These benefits, make the cloud environment
more resilient, to the cloud threats.

172
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,820
Now, let's see what are the key
components of micro segmentation.

173
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:26,450
micro segmentation basically
relies on three key components.

174
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,410
One, policy enforcement.

175
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,280
Number two, visibility.

176
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,060
And number third one is the automation.

177
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:38,490
These components work collaboratively
and together to create a robust

178
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,680
security framework that isolates
workloads and monitors traffic and

179
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,330
also adapts to network changes.

180
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,140
Now.

181
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,230
Let's, take a step back and look,
these three components individually.

182
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,160
The first one, policy enforcement.

183
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,690
This uses identity based rules
rather than just IP address,

184
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,680
IP, based on IP addresses.

185
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,300
Instead of static firewall rules
that rely only on IP addresses, micro

186
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:08,080
segmentation basically implements the
segmentation policies that may block

187
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,060
legitimate traffic, segmentation policies
that are defined based on work at

188
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:17,160
workload attributes, such as application
identity, security tags, or user roles.

189
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:22,130
Now this ensures that the policies
remain effective even as the workloads

190
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,180
move or scale in the cloud environments.

191
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,560
The next thing, the key component
is the visibility because without

192
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:33,670
measuring the effectiveness or,
without measuring the internal traffic.

193
00:12:34,015 --> 00:12:36,865
to understand the communication
back pattern and detect anomalies.

194
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:41,095
we, we need that metric in order for
us to implement, micro segmentation.

195
00:12:41,435 --> 00:12:45,035
Without proper visibility,
segmentation policies may block

196
00:12:45,215 --> 00:12:46,755
legitimate traffic as well.

197
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:49,505
and leave critical systems exposed.

198
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:53,925
Now, in order to, in order for us
to do this, we need to perform deep

199
00:12:53,935 --> 00:12:59,255
packet inspection, flow monitoring,
and also adapt to AI driven analytics.

200
00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:05,015
AI driven analytics, what else, I
can think of, yeah, basically these

201
00:13:05,015 --> 00:13:10,065
all help us identify, the security
risk and, optimize the policies.

202
00:13:10,545 --> 00:13:11,655
The third one is automation.

203
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:17,375
Now as the cloud environment itself
is dynamic, the policies must adapt

204
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,315
dynamically as the workload changes.

205
00:13:19,835 --> 00:13:23,295
Now this is to prevent
misconfigurations and security gaps.

206
00:13:23,795 --> 00:13:26,685
As we all know, cloud environments
are highly dynamic and workloads

207
00:13:26,795 --> 00:13:29,335
frequently spin up and down.

208
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:34,265
Automated micro segmentation solutions
continuously access the network traffic.

209
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:39,300
Enforce real time security controls
and minimize manual intervention.

210
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,197
overall, these are the key
components of the micro segmentation.

211
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:49,590
In the next slide, we will see what
are all, the different steps that we

212
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:54,180
need to perform, to implement, micro
segmentation in cloud environments.

213
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,350
One thing I would like to mention
is start with a phased approach.

214
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:02,060
Okay, now we are not required
to segment everything at once

215
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,920
because it can lead to a disaster.

216
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,840
The first step would be to map application
dependencies and network flows.

217
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,490
And the second step is to define
security policies based on

218
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,890
the actual traffic patterns.

219
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,400
We may not be able to derive actual
traffic patterns, but, estimated

220
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:21,880
traffic patterns, to a good level
of, degree of accuracy should work.

221
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:26,170
and deploy segmentation in monitoring
mode first to detect any issues.

222
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:33,030
And once we deploy the segmentation in
monitoring mode and we let it run, soak

223
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:38,070
in there, gradually enforce the policies,
starting with non critical workloads.

224
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,560
Now, the best practice would be to
involve cross functional teams and

225
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,420
testing policies because, common
pitfalls that I have seen are like over

226
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,140
segmentation leads to broken applications.

227
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,410
And it's a best practice to avoid
static rules and use dynamic policies

228
00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:00,320
that are just with the environment and
always review the, regularly review

229
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,590
the policies to ensure that, they
still align with the business needs.

230
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,850
Now let's take, let's go ahead
and, review a couple of, use

231
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,980
cases of this micro segmentation.

232
00:15:12,385 --> 00:15:16,115
The first use case that I can
think of is, financial services.

233
00:15:16,645 --> 00:15:21,025
One of the industries that have benefited
immensely with the microsegmentation

234
00:15:21,735 --> 00:15:23,075
is the financial services.

235
00:15:23,795 --> 00:15:27,765
This is because financial institutions
handle large, high amount of sensitive

236
00:15:27,825 --> 00:15:31,495
data, which includes customer
information and transaction records.

237
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:36,245
A breach in a financial service
can lead to a significant

238
00:15:36,245 --> 00:15:38,045
financial and reputational damage.

239
00:15:38,885 --> 00:15:42,945
microsegmentation allows these
institutions to separate critical data

240
00:15:43,515 --> 00:15:50,435
from less sensitive systems, protecting,
more sensitive data and, most valuable

241
00:15:50,485 --> 00:15:55,475
information, I would say, and minimizing
the potential exposure of a data breach.

242
00:15:56,265 --> 00:16:00,645
Similar to this, the next industry
that I can see more benefitted

243
00:16:00,645 --> 00:16:01,855
is the healthcare industry.

244
00:16:02,355 --> 00:16:06,475
Protection of patient data is the
paramount and health organizations

245
00:16:06,475 --> 00:16:10,225
must comply with strict regulatory
frameworks such as CPI and all.

246
00:16:10,765 --> 00:16:15,515
in order to, in order to ensure
by segmenting the cloud, by

247
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:16,915
segmenting the cloud networks,

248
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:21,085
This segmentation minimizes
the risk of breach affecting

249
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,935
sensitive health data for sure.

250
00:16:24,455 --> 00:16:28,797
but that doesn't mean that it comes
without any challenges and considerations.

251
00:16:28,797 --> 00:16:32,658
There are definitely few challenges
and considerations that we

252
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,090
need to take into account while
implementing microsegmentation.

253
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:43,370
because microsegmentation is dividing your
network into smaller segments, we need to

254
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,070
carefully plan the implementation strategy
to avoid any operational disruptions

255
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,790
and ensure that the segmentation
policies remain effective, over time.

256
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:56,420
Now, the first challenge
is the complexity.

257
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,050
Now, implementing micro segmentation
requires a deep understanding of

258
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:04,350
the network architecture on how
applications interact and all.

259
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,780
Organizations definitely must map
out the communication between the

260
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,480
workloads, identify dependencies
and define granular policies.

261
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:18,180
The reason for this is because
without proper planning, the risk

262
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:22,550
of blocking legitimate traffic
or creating security gaps that

263
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,570
attackers can exploit is very high.

264
00:17:25,365 --> 00:17:26,965
the next is the performance overhead.

265
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:31,475
The reason why there will be definitely
performance overhead because adding

266
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:34,975
multiple layers of security can
sometimes impact workload performance,

267
00:17:35,715 --> 00:17:40,455
especially in high traffic environments,
because firewalls, security agents

268
00:17:40,455 --> 00:17:44,795
and access control mechanisms require
quite a bit of computational resources

269
00:17:44,845 --> 00:17:46,515
to inspect and filter the traffic.

270
00:17:47,055 --> 00:17:52,345
Now, in order to overcome this
organizations must carefully optimize.

271
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,655
Security policies and monitor
system performance to balance

272
00:17:55,665 --> 00:17:56,955
security and efficiency.

273
00:17:57,845 --> 00:18:01,345
without adding more latency issues.

274
00:18:01,725 --> 00:18:04,665
And the last but not the least
is continuous monitoring.

275
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:09,085
Because the cloud, and we are talking
specifically about the cloud here.

276
00:18:09,185 --> 00:18:11,615
So as the cloud environments
are highly dynamic.

277
00:18:12,335 --> 00:18:15,495
With the workloads constantly
changing, scaling up and down.

278
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,545
Microsegmentation policies.

279
00:18:17,935 --> 00:18:20,555
must be regularly updated to
accommodate these changes.

280
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:26,275
The risk is, if these policies become
outdated, they can either block the

281
00:18:26,295 --> 00:18:30,355
essential traffic or leave security
gaps that again attackers can exploit.

282
00:18:30,855 --> 00:18:35,755
continuous security audits and AI driven
policy automation can help policies

283
00:18:36,185 --> 00:18:37,865
align with evolving infrastructure.

284
00:18:38,555 --> 00:18:42,995
Apart from these, there are a few more
challenges such as operational overheads.

285
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:49,830
Because managing a huge number of
micro segments across the cloud, on

286
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:55,550
premise, or hybrid environments can
significantly add administrative burden.

287
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,210
Now, without automation, manually
defining and enforcing security rules

288
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,040
can become overwhelming as well.

289
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:08,440
the organizations have to, and must
leverage orchestration tools and

290
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,870
integrate segmentation with DevOps.

291
00:19:10,555 --> 00:19:16,115
Workflows to reduce this complexity
and few other challenges can be user

292
00:19:16,185 --> 00:19:21,875
resistance and change management because
developers and IT teams may initially

293
00:19:22,005 --> 00:19:27,835
resist strict segmentation policies,
especially if it impacts the productivity

294
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:32,325
and slows down the application development
or creates, heat on the performance.

295
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,385
like there could definitely be resistance.

296
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,370
And misconfigurations
is one of the key risks.

297
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:44,310
because we need to make sure that, the
implemented automation policy validation

298
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,050
and regular segmentation audits need
to be performed effectively in order to

299
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,490
detect and avoid any misconfigurations.

300
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,610
these are the few challenges
and considerations.

301
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:57,850
Now.

302
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,980
What are the best practices of
implementing like the best practices we

303
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,190
have touched upon this in the previous
slides, but let's have a quick look the

304
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:13,420
best practices are like start with the
security audit by auditing the current

305
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:18,630
network to identify what vulnerabilities
and understand the communication pattern

306
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,120
between the workloads is the key thing.

307
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,220
The next thing is zero trust
use zero trust as foundation.

308
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,440
The micro segmentation strategy has to
be built on a zero trust model, where no

309
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:38,750
entity is trusted by default and access is
granted only when properly authenticated.

310
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,070
The third thing is automation.

311
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:46,750
Usage of automation tools to dynamically
adjust policies as cloud environments

312
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:51,540
grow or change, ensuring the security
scales with the business needs.

313
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:57,710
is a key best practice, I would say,
and in the market right now, there

314
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,930
are several, tools available for
implementing micro segmentation.

315
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,370
A few of them are like VMware, NSX,
Cisco, Tetheration are some of the

316
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:10,410
leading platforms that offer comprehensive
micro segmentation capabilities.

317
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,000
and as the topic is cloud native
for cloud native environments

318
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,614
like AWS security groups and Azure
network security groups allowed.

319
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:22,915
users to implement segmentation
directly in the cloud platforms.

320
00:21:23,645 --> 00:21:28,375
and the last thing is the integration
of micro segmentation with SDN software

321
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:33,315
defined networking is another key trend,
allowing greater agility and scalability.

322
00:21:33,755 --> 00:21:38,225
And basically choosing the right
tool, depends upon the size,

323
00:21:38,265 --> 00:21:40,885
complexity, and specific needs
of the cloud infrastructure.

324
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:46,170
let's look at what are all the
future trends, future of cloud

325
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,380
security with micro, what are
the trends of, micro segmentation

326
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,680
in the future of cloud security.

327
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,710
Let's have a quick look.

328
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,610
basically automation and AI.

329
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,690
We are seeing a rise of AI powered tools,
that can automatically detect threats and

330
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,560
adjust security policies in real time.

331
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,570
so AI driven micro segmentation
solutions will enable.

332
00:22:07,045 --> 00:22:11,385
effective, predictive threat detection,
allowing organizations to proactively

333
00:22:11,385 --> 00:22:16,225
block any suspicious activity before
it escalates, and evolving threats.

334
00:22:16,285 --> 00:22:20,105
Cyber threats are threat, evolving
threat landscape, cyber threats have

335
00:22:20,175 --> 00:22:23,565
continued to grow in sophistication,
which means that micro segmentation

336
00:22:24,015 --> 00:22:28,955
strategies or any security strategy for
the matter of fact, also must continuously

337
00:22:28,955 --> 00:22:31,095
evolve to stay ahead of the attackers.

338
00:22:31,605 --> 00:22:37,695
Because attackers are increasingly
leveraging AI and continuous automation

339
00:22:37,715 --> 00:22:42,395
to conduct lateral movement and
various other kinds of attacks.

340
00:22:43,275 --> 00:22:47,265
Because making real time security,
analytics and behavior based

341
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,505
segmentation has become essential.

342
00:22:49,965 --> 00:22:54,575
Now, the future implementations
of micro segmentation will need to

343
00:22:54,575 --> 00:22:57,545
incorporate continuous risk assessments.

344
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:03,445
Because that will ensure, policies
adapt dynamically based on new threat

345
00:23:03,445 --> 00:23:04,845
intelligence and attack vectors.

346
00:23:05,265 --> 00:23:11,005
And it's also coming up more in IOT and
edge compute, edge computing devices.

347
00:23:11,105 --> 00:23:14,855
And, especially in the cloud native
and multi cloud adoption patterns.

348
00:23:14,855 --> 00:23:16,455
this we are seeing a lot of trend.

349
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:21,445
The, so with this, let's, look at
the conclusion and key takeaways.

350
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:28,280
to conclude, microsegmentation offers a
significant leap towards, securing a cloud

351
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,010
environment by allowing organizations
to create granular and isolated

352
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,200
segments within the cloud environments.

353
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:41,010
This does by reducing the attack service
and preventing lateral movement and

354
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,820
providing granular control over access.

355
00:23:43,595 --> 00:23:46,355
Microsegmentation offers much
stronger security posture.

356
00:23:46,855 --> 00:23:48,635
with this, thanks for the opportunity.
