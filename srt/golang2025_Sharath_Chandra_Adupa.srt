00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,060
Greetings to all the
listeners joining me today.

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,680
My name is Chen apa.

4
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,510
Today I will be talking about securing
PI data in cloud environments.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,140
Before we jump into the topic,
let me quickly introduce myself.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,370
I'm a technical enthusiast with 20
years of experience in IT industry.

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,310
I work with different
companies in financial sector

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,260
and health sector at tenure.

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,400
So far, I played many roles as software
engineer, full stack, job developer, data

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,140
engineer, and data architect, and so on.

11
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:32,910
And today's session is going to be
recorded one, so feel free to reach

12
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,739
out to me if you have any questions
on my email address RA gmail.com.

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,860
Let's move on to the first slide,
securing PI data in cloud environment.

14
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,890
Let's begin this with a simple question.

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:47,970
What is data?

16
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:55,260
Data is distinct pieces of information
which are facts and statistics collected

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,870
together for reference and for.

18
00:00:58,305 --> 00:00:59,265
Doing analysis.

19
00:01:00,015 --> 00:01:04,155
Every organization collects data
from different individuals and

20
00:01:04,155 --> 00:01:05,715
firms whom they interact with.

21
00:01:06,765 --> 00:01:12,645
And these users can be clients,
customers, vendors, and so on.

22
00:01:13,095 --> 00:01:17,205
And based on the kind of relationship
they maintain with these users, they

23
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,355
capture different sets of information
and store it in their systems.

24
00:01:22,245 --> 00:01:23,414
Let's move on to the acronym.

25
00:01:23,414 --> 00:01:26,295
P-I-I-P-I-I stands for.

26
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,220
Personally identifiable information
that is the unique identifiers through

27
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,600
which we can identify a person.

28
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,330
And securing this PII information
is very critical for any

29
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,830
organization to be successful.

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,720
And now the companies like,  be it small,
medium and large, all the companies

31
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,950
are planning to move towards the cloud
platform because of the advantages they

32
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,960
provide,  along with the advantages.

33
00:01:55,589 --> 00:02:00,420
There are challenges like
protecting this PII data is more

34
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,920
challenging in cloud environments.

35
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:08,279
So in this session today, we'll
be talking about core encryption

36
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:12,719
strategies, data obfuscation
techniques, advanced protection

37
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,300
methods, and implementation frameworks.

38
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,269
So in this slide, I will quickly
give some examples of PI data and

39
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:24,810
the different critical production
factors and regulatory landscapes.

40
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:30,870
So just before this slide, I gave
the definition of PII data, and

41
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,610
now I will give the few examples.

42
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:39,159
Social security number, this is a,
which I shortly call as SSN in us.

43
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:43,919
This is a unique way to identify
an individual and,  if you

44
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,999
talk about the other different
identifiers, like credit cards.

45
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:51,929
So credit cards of an
individual are unique and they

46
00:02:51,929 --> 00:02:53,309
uniquely identify the person.

47
00:02:54,614 --> 00:02:57,845
Along with that, there are
combination of fields like name,

48
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,075
date of birth, and address.

49
00:02:59,885 --> 00:03:02,285
These fields are also
uniquely identifier person

50
00:03:04,775 --> 00:03:08,165
and moving to the next, the
critical production factors.

51
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:12,935
The privacy preserving data mining
techniques have become essential

52
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:16,864
in protecting sensitive information
while maintaining data utility.

53
00:03:17,435 --> 00:03:21,605
These PPTM techniques aim to
extract valuable knowledge from

54
00:03:21,605 --> 00:03:25,954
data while safeguarding sensitive
information focusing on a trade

55
00:03:25,954 --> 00:03:27,515
off between accuracy and privacy.

56
00:03:29,645 --> 00:03:34,850
There are different regulatory agencies
like G-D-P-R-C-C-P-A-H-I-P-A-A.

57
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:40,475
These establish baseline requirements,
but most organizations go beyond

58
00:03:40,475 --> 00:03:43,984
these basic requirements and
build and implement sophisticated

59
00:03:43,984 --> 00:03:45,634
privacy preservation techniques.

60
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:51,634
Now let's talk about cloud
computing, security challenges,

61
00:03:52,804 --> 00:03:53,644
multi-tenant environments.

62
00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:59,134
Now the cloud environments introduce
additional complexity to PII production

63
00:03:59,524 --> 00:04:03,844
with key concerns including data
privacy, integrity and availability,

64
00:04:04,414 --> 00:04:07,774
and shared infrastructures where
multiple clients use the same resources.

65
00:04:09,034 --> 00:04:12,634
Technical challenges, organizations
must address these challenges through

66
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:16,849
comprehensive security architecture
that incorporate both traditional

67
00:04:16,864 --> 00:04:21,424
security measures and advanced privacy
preserving techniques specifically

68
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:22,729
designed for cloud environments.

69
00:04:23,975 --> 00:04:26,314
And there are a few custom
security approaches as well.

70
00:04:27,605 --> 00:04:32,044
Organizations will develop tailored
approaches that consider both technical

71
00:04:32,044 --> 00:04:35,645
aspects of the cloud, security and the
requirements of privacy, preserving

72
00:04:35,645 --> 00:04:40,235
data mining techniques, implementing
appropriate encryption schemes, and

73
00:04:40,235 --> 00:04:42,005
securing key management systems.

74
00:04:43,895 --> 00:04:49,355
Now let's talk about core encryption
strategies, and the first strategy is

75
00:04:49,684 --> 00:04:51,485
when the data is addressed production.

76
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:56,449
Encryption at rest ensures data
security through application level

77
00:04:56,449 --> 00:05:01,280
encryption volume and file level
encryption and database encryption,

78
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:06,469
transforming sensitive information
into cipher text using cryptographic

79
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:10,714
algorithms that make it unreadable,
which are proper decryption keys.

80
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:18,109
Next customer manager keys, the
CMEK in a so cloud environment.

81
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:22,684
Provide organizations with advanced
control over their data security

82
00:05:23,225 --> 00:05:26,314
while maintaining compliance
with data residency requirements.

83
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:28,534
Bring your own key.

84
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:32,954
This is another strategy,  which
gives the organizations control

85
00:05:32,954 --> 00:05:34,334
over encryption processes.

86
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:38,204
Organizations can generate and
store their keys in secure walls,

87
00:05:38,924 --> 00:05:43,064
maintaining sovereignty over their
encryption materials while meeting

88
00:05:43,064 --> 00:05:44,894
strict data residency requirements.

89
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:53,849
Encryption implementation considerations
at application level encryption,  that

90
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:58,499
uses advanced encryption standard
with a block size of 2 56 bids.

91
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:04,139
This provides a security impact of
direct protection of data at application

92
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,619
layer, volume, and file level encryption.

93
00:06:08,265 --> 00:06:13,184
Implements full disc encryption
with R-S-A-R-S-A provides,

94
00:06:13,364 --> 00:06:15,104
identity security solutions.

95
00:06:15,884 --> 00:06:19,184
They deliver automated identity
intelligence, authentication

96
00:06:19,184 --> 00:06:23,534
access, governance, and lifecycle
capabilities to defend, again, is the

97
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:26,085
highest impact cybersecurity risks.

98
00:06:27,074 --> 00:06:29,799
And these provide complete
production of stored data.

99
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:34,879
For the components like database,  we
use the database encryption, which

100
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:40,660
combines both symmetric and asymmetric
key algorithms and these secure

101
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,580
structure data in our databases.

102
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,940
The key exchange protocols, RSA based
security key transmission, and this

103
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,800
ensures security key distribution.

104
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:56,440
And the other component is
geographic boundary controls.

105
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,530
Basically in cloud environments, we
can use region specific key storage

106
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:06,320
and operations, and with this we
provide the main data solidarity.

107
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,330
Now, let's know about data
obfuscation techniques.

108
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,400
These techniques talk about the
transformation of data into an unreadable

109
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,280
format using an algorithm and a key making
it secure unless the key is obtained.

110
00:07:24,605 --> 00:07:28,235
There are three main approaches
for data obfuscation.

111
00:07:29,645 --> 00:07:33,695
One is policy driven approach,
second data masking, and third

112
00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:37,175
tokenization policy driven data.

113
00:07:37,235 --> 00:07:41,585
Obfuscation uses predefined rules
and policies to automatically mask or

114
00:07:41,585 --> 00:07:46,055
transform sensitive data, protecting
it from unauthorized access, while

115
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:50,195
still allowing its use for legitimate
purposes like testing and development.

116
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:56,210
Organizations implementing policy-driven
masking solutions, reduce data compliance

117
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:01,190
violations by approximately 85% while
maintaining data, referential integrity.

118
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,590
Data masking.

119
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,530
It is a irrevocable process that
transforms the data into meaningless text.

120
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,600
It operates through comprehensive
policies that define how different types

121
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,270
of sensitive data should be transformed.

122
00:08:19,055 --> 00:08:19,775
Next tokenization.

123
00:08:21,664 --> 00:08:26,225
Unlike masking, which typically
alters data values, irreversibility

124
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:30,575
tokenization preserves the ability
to reverse the process while

125
00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:32,585
maintaining strong security controls.

126
00:08:33,455 --> 00:08:39,755
Generally, we apply tokenization
onto data address and will de

127
00:08:39,755 --> 00:08:41,225
tokenize it while retrieving it.

128
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:45,875
Recent implementation show
that tokenization can reduce

129
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,435
the scope of compliance audit.

130
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,130
Up to 70%.

131
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,730
Next, let's know about effectiveness
of data production techniques.

132
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,760
This chart illustrate the effectiveness
of various data production techniques

133
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,140
in enterprise environments.

134
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,180
Automated discovery shows the
highest effectiveness at 93%.

135
00:09:08,855 --> 00:09:14,225
Followed by policy driven approach
at 80, 85%, organizations with

136
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:18,605
well-defined governance structures
achieve 78% higher success rate in

137
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:20,135
their data production initiatives.

138
00:09:21,305 --> 00:09:24,005
Now let's talk about advanced
data production methods.

139
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:30,425
Anonymization involves irreversible
modifying data to prevent

140
00:09:30,425 --> 00:09:35,585
identification, including removal of
direct identifiers and processing of.

141
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:39,350
CauseI identifiers that could
lead to re-identification.

142
00:09:41,045 --> 00:09:45,605
Pseudonymization replaces identifiable
data with artificial identifiers,

143
00:09:46,055 --> 00:09:49,655
allowing for potential re-identification
with additional information.

144
00:09:51,005 --> 00:09:56,855
Risk assessment requires systematic
evaluation of both the sensitivity

145
00:09:56,855 --> 00:09:59,945
of the data and the potential
for re-identification before

146
00:09:59,945 --> 00:10:01,325
applying protection techniques.

147
00:10:02,165 --> 00:10:04,925
It involves combination of
anonymization and pseudonymization.

148
00:10:07,295 --> 00:10:11,735
Differential privacy provides
mathematical guarantees of privacy

149
00:10:11,855 --> 00:10:16,835
while maintaining significant analytical
value, particularly beneficial for

150
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:21,035
media companies and organizations
handling large scale consumer data.

151
00:10:22,445 --> 00:10:25,595
Now let's talk about sector specific
implementation requirements.

152
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:29,885
Different sectors have different
PII specific requirements.

153
00:10:31,265 --> 00:10:36,125
Healthcare research requires very high
privacy standards with anonymization

154
00:10:36,215 --> 00:10:37,835
plus differential privacy techniques.

155
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:42,905
HIPAA compliance is a key implementation
factor while maintaining high data utility

156
00:10:42,905 --> 00:10:46,445
for research purposes, academic research.

157
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:50,915
This also demands high privacy standards
with differential privacy techniques.

158
00:10:51,635 --> 00:10:54,995
Research validating is a key
implementation factor with high

159
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:59,255
data utility requirements to support
meaningful academic findings.

160
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:05,480
Market analysis needs medium privacy
production through pseudonymization

161
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:10,400
with business intelligence as the king
implementation factor, data utility

162
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:16,130
priority is very high to ensure valuable
insights can still be extracted.

163
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:21,680
Financial services requires very high
privacy protection through combined

164
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,330
pseudonymization and encryption.

165
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,620
Regulatory compliance is a key
implementation factor with high data,

166
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,410
utility needs for business operations.

167
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,150
Next, let's talk about
implementation guidelines.

168
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,660
Effective governance structures can reduce
security incidents by up to 60% through

169
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,880
improved oversight and coordination.

170
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:48,875
Organizations with mature change
management process experience

171
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,895
50% fewer security related
disruptions during implementation.

172
00:11:53,765 --> 00:11:57,935
While effective performance optimization
can reduce system overhead from

173
00:11:57,935 --> 00:12:02,525
security measures by up to 40%
while maintaining production levels.

174
00:12:03,665 --> 00:12:06,030
Next, now move on to the conclusion slide.

175
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:12,335
Balancing security and utility successful
PIA protection in cloud environments.

176
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,400
Requires combining technical
expertise with strong governance

177
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,780
frameworks, integrating encryption
strategies, obfuscation techniques,

178
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,850
and advanced production methods.

179
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:29,689
Policy driven security, implementing
policy driven approaches is critical for

180
00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:34,520
maintaining consistent security controls
while reducing operational overhead

181
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,530
across complex cloud environments.

182
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:42,050
Policy driven security approach automates
the protection of sensitive data elements,

183
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:46,880
ensuring consistent application of
security controls across the enterprise.

184
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:52,550
Continuous adaption organizations must
maintain flexible, adaptable security

185
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:57,380
architectures with continuous monitoring
and regular updates to address emerging

186
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,970
threats while ensuring operational
efficiency balance of production.

187
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,700
Effective PI security requires
balancing data, utility with privacy

188
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,120
requirements while maintaining
compliance with regulatory frameworks

189
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,120
like G-D-P-R-C-C-P-A and hipaa.

190
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,250
And finally, thank you
all for listening to me.

191
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,760
