00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:03,810
I'm Satish Kumar Puram.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,490
I work as a specialist leader
in Deloitte Consulting, LLP

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,510
based out of Atlanta office.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,320
I do lot scale SAP implementation
across the globe, and I have been doing

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,480
this from last 22 years in my career.

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,349
And I've done multiple SAP
implementations for big clients.

8
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:25,889
From various industries, starting
from manufacturing, insurance,

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,970
retail all sorts of industries I
would say that I've touched upon.

10
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:35,240
As part of con 42 mission Learning
2025, I would like to present the

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,710
driving digital transformation in
insurance with SAP and and machine

12
00:00:38,795 --> 00:00:40,805
learning and a leadership perspective.

13
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:45,455
Now in today's insurance landscape,
the convergence of SAP expertise and

14
00:00:45,455 --> 00:00:47,405
machine learning technology is creating.

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,240
Unprecedented opportunities
for transformation.

16
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:54,755
This presentation explores how forward
thinking insurance companies are

17
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:58,535
leveraging these powerful tools to
overcome industry challenges and create

18
00:00:58,535 --> 00:01:00,965
sustainable competitive advantages.

19
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:05,555
We'll examine practical applications
across claims management,

20
00:01:05,885 --> 00:01:09,275
underwriting, and policy
administration while highlighting

21
00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:11,260
the real world success stories.

22
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,630
That demonstrate measurable dis impact.

23
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,520
Now, if you come to the insurance
sector, the insurance landscape,

24
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,350
there are multiple challenges.

25
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,220
Now, the notable challenges that
I would say is your InsureTech

26
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:29,050
disruption, like new digital first
competitors are challenging traditional

27
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:33,190
insurance models with agile operations
and innovative product offers.

28
00:01:33,255 --> 00:01:37,150
At the same way you have limitations
based on legacy system that is.

29
00:01:37,715 --> 00:01:41,095
You have an outdated infrastructure
restricts innovations.

30
00:01:41,395 --> 00:01:47,075
It creates data silos and increases
operational cost for established insurers.

31
00:01:47,285 --> 00:01:49,685
Same way, cybersecurity
threats is a big concern.

32
00:01:49,955 --> 00:01:53,345
Increasing sophistication of attacks
against sensitive policyholder

33
00:01:53,675 --> 00:01:58,505
data demands robust security
solutions and proactive monitoring.

34
00:01:58,565 --> 00:02:01,055
Same way changing customer expectations.

35
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:04,265
You have digital, having
customers demand personalized,

36
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:05,735
frictionless experience across.

37
00:02:06,065 --> 00:02:09,035
All touch points and
immediate service resolution.

38
00:02:09,394 --> 00:02:12,885
Now answer this problems
within the insurance landscape.

39
00:02:12,885 --> 00:02:15,585
I think SAP has come up
with multiple solutions.

40
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:21,615
Now, SAP solutions, powering insurance
transformation has set a 61 percentage.

41
00:02:21,615 --> 00:02:26,745
A process time in reducing all
processing time with SAP implementation,

42
00:02:26,775 --> 00:02:32,355
as well as it has provide 30% of
efficiency gain by Im by improving in

43
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:34,425
operational efficiency across functions.

44
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:38,565
And there is approximately 40
percentage cost reduction in

45
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:40,245
operational cost through automation.

46
00:02:40,545 --> 00:02:43,695
And at the same point
time, there is 3.5 x.

47
00:02:43,995 --> 00:02:46,785
A written of investment within
24 months of deployment.

48
00:02:47,115 --> 00:02:50,925
These impressive metrics
demonstrate why leading insurers

49
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:52,515
are investing in SAP solutions.

50
00:02:52,845 --> 00:02:57,975
By leveraging these powerful platforms,
companies are achieving unprinted levels

51
00:02:57,975 --> 00:03:02,505
of efficiency while simultaneously
improving customer satisfaction

52
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:04,410
and reducing operational costs.

53
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,250
Now.

54
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,250
How SAP is solving this problem, how core
SAP solutions for insurance is helping

55
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,570
solve the problems of insurance companies.

56
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:18,220
Now, SAP comes with SAPS four
hana, which brings in a real time

57
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,080
data processing and an analytics
foundation that supports intelligent

58
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,120
enterprise operations for insurance.

59
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,190
And there is a specific SAP insurance
analyzer tool that has been specifically

60
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,870
customized and designed for.

61
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:36,625
Insurance companies, which
specializes in risk analysis and

62
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:40,855
complaints management for insurance
specific regulatory requirements.

63
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:45,025
And there is a systematic data
maintenance sewer, which helps in

64
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:49,645
comprehensive data integration,
quality management, and governance

65
00:03:49,825 --> 00:03:51,565
for insurance information lifecycle.

66
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,910
And in the same way there
is S-A-P-C-R-M module.

67
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,350
This is very specific to customers.

68
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:03,560
It is customer centric platform enabling
personalized policy holders, ex expertise

69
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,010
experiences and relationship management.

70
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,390
These integrated solutions create a
foundation for insurance companies

71
00:04:10,515 --> 00:04:16,649
to build modern digital operations
by connecting previously so solid

72
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,179
functions, insurance gaining.

73
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,960
Complete view of their business
and can make data driven

74
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,150
decisions with confidence.

75
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,919
And with SAP implementation, even with
machine learning integration there

76
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,219
are certain practical applications
that comes up with the advantages.

77
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:37,759
The main advantages that we see
out of machine learning integration

78
00:04:38,179 --> 00:04:40,999
is with claims processing
automation, as an example.

79
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:45,559
Now, machine learning algorithms
review claim documents.

80
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:50,899
Identify fraud indicators and automated
straightforward claims approval,

81
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:55,819
reducing processing time from days
two minutes while retaining accuracy.

82
00:04:56,059 --> 00:05:00,709
At the same time, mission learning
comes up with dynamic underwriting which

83
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:06,019
helps in pre predictive models, analyze
customer data to generate personalized

84
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,669
risk profiles and premium calculations,
enabling more accurate pricing.

85
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:16,369
And expanded coverage options for
previously underserved segments.

86
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:19,729
Now, there is a AI driven
customer service as well.

87
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:23,889
The virtual assistance and
sentiment analysis tools enhance

88
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:28,209
customer interactions flow 24
by seven support which leads to

89
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:32,619
proactive issue identification,
and personalized recommendations

90
00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:34,779
based on policy details and history.

91
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:38,529
This application
demonstrate how SAP system.

92
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:42,444
Enriched with mission
learning capabilities deliver

93
00:05:42,654 --> 00:05:44,124
tangible business benefits.

94
00:05:44,364 --> 00:05:48,804
The integration creates intelligent
workflows that continuously

95
00:05:48,804 --> 00:05:51,654
improves through data analysis
and pattern recognization.

96
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:57,054
Now, system integration strategies
within SAP and mission learning that

97
00:05:57,054 --> 00:05:59,524
would come as business value alignment.

98
00:05:59,674 --> 00:06:02,709
This integration prioritized
by business impact.

99
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:07,529
API first architecture, standard
connections between systems, data

100
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:11,279
governance, frame framework, consistent
data quality across platforms.

101
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,039
Security by design protection embedded
through I, I've seen security by

102
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,209
design as one of an important component
in my experience where insurance

103
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:23,729
companies are very happy with now.

104
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:28,019
Successful integration requires a
strategic approach that balances technical

105
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:29,904
requirements with business objectives.

106
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:35,159
By establishing this foundational
elements, insurance companies can create

107
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:40,859
a flexible architecture that connects
legacy systems with modern SAP solutions.

108
00:06:41,204 --> 00:06:45,584
While ensuring data integrity and
security, this pyramid approach

109
00:06:45,854 --> 00:06:51,104
emphasizes starting with business
alignment and binding upward through

110
00:06:51,254 --> 00:06:55,334
increasing technical layers, ensuring
that integration efforts deliver

111
00:06:55,574 --> 00:07:00,644
maximum value while minimizing
disruption to ongoing operations.

112
00:07:01,994 --> 00:07:05,624
One of the biggest challenges
that I've seen in my entire career

113
00:07:05,744 --> 00:07:10,004
while implementing SAP, not only to
insurance, even it applies to other.

114
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:12,359
Industries is data migration.

115
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:17,909
Now with SAP with machine learning,
there is a data migration where we

116
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:19,919
are putting in this practice now.

117
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,489
One of those will, will cover them one
by one, data discovery and assessment,

118
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:28,829
comprehensive audit of existing
data sources, quality assessment and

119
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:32,909
mapping into target SAP structures to
identify transformation requirements.

120
00:07:33,254 --> 00:07:34,334
Cleansing and enrichment.

121
00:07:34,364 --> 00:07:37,574
Of course, cleansing plays an
important role with data migration.

122
00:07:37,574 --> 00:07:41,624
So what we do as part of cleansing
and enrichment, systematic process to

123
00:07:41,624 --> 00:07:47,654
address data quality issues, eliminate
redundancies, and enhance record with

124
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:49,904
additional attributes to maximize value.

125
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,109
Testing and validation.

126
00:07:52,109 --> 00:07:53,429
Of course, very important.

127
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:59,519
Multiple test cycles with respective data
samples to verify transformation rules,

128
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,069
system performance and business process.

129
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:05,849
Integrating post migration
monitoring while once the

130
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:07,709
migration is done will not stop.

131
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,189
The monitoring will be continuously
monitoring the system, the

132
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:12,359
data that you're getting in.

133
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:16,679
So what we do as part of post
migration monitoring is to do an

134
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:18,839
ongoing evaluation of data accuracy.

135
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,729
System performance and business
processes effectiveness to identify

136
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,799
and address issues quickly.

137
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:32,369
Insurance companies handle massive
volumes of sensitive data across policies,

138
00:08:32,369 --> 00:08:36,944
claims, and customer records following the
structured migration practices ensures.

139
00:08:37,615 --> 00:08:42,295
This valuable information transfers
correctly to SAP platforms

140
00:08:42,475 --> 00:08:46,405
while maintaining the regulatory
compliance and business continuity

141
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:50,270
now process automation framework.

142
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,569
What we do as part of this
process automation framework is

143
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,000
process discovery and analysis.

144
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,510
The first step is identify the
process, workflow, observation and

145
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:04,520
documentation, identification of
automation candidates written of

146
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,469
investment calculation for each process.

147
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:09,139
Stakeholder alignment on priorities.

148
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:13,279
Then the next step would be automation,
design and development process

149
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,679
redesign for optimization, RPA bot
programming and configuration ML

150
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:21,439
model training for decision points.

151
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:24,109
Of course, machine learning models
will be very effective here and

152
00:09:24,109 --> 00:09:25,669
SAP system integration setup.

153
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:29,749
Once this is automation, design and
development is done naturally, we'll

154
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:33,859
go into the testing and deployment
mode wherein we do control testing.

155
00:09:34,204 --> 00:09:39,195
In staging en environments, user
accept acceptance verification,

156
00:09:39,585 --> 00:09:41,385
then phased implementation approach.

157
00:09:41,535 --> 00:09:43,905
And then we do a performance
monitoring dashboard setup.

158
00:09:44,295 --> 00:09:49,545
And after that, once deployment is done,
there is always a lookout for a continuous

159
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:53,745
improvement wherein we look into the
regular process performance reviews.

160
00:09:54,105 --> 00:09:58,665
We do machine learning, model retaining
with new data, as well as automation

161
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:03,075
expansion to related processes, and then
technology updates and enhancements.

162
00:10:03,689 --> 00:10:06,839
This comprehensive framework
guides insurers through the

163
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,380
automation journey from initial
identification of opportunities

164
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,300
through ongoing enhancements.

165
00:10:12,675 --> 00:10:18,115
By following this structured
approach, companies can e effectively

166
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:23,455
transform manual insurance processes
into streamlined digital workflows.

167
00:10:25,135 --> 00:10:28,495
As part of this process, there are
leadership challenges as well in

168
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:31,375
SAP implementations, and one of
the important challenge would be

169
00:10:31,525 --> 00:10:33,115
cross-functional team management.

170
00:10:33,444 --> 00:10:38,275
Successful SAP implementations require
alignment between IT specialists,

171
00:10:38,395 --> 00:10:40,944
business units, and external consultants.

172
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,100
Leader must bridge technical and
business perspectives while managing

173
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,830
competing priorities and resource
constraints across departments.

174
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,750
That is one of a big
challenge that I would say.

175
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:58,000
And then the next one would be business
continuity during transition, maintaining

176
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,220
uninterrupted insurance operations.

177
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,010
During implementation is critical.

178
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:07,620
Leaders must develop comprehensive
transition strategies that minimize

179
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,510
disruption to customer service, claims
processing, and policy management

180
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,520
throughout the transformation.

181
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:19,570
Then the technical technical barrier
resolution, complex technical challenges

182
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,610
inevitably arise during implementation,
effective leaders established

183
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,130
robust problem solving frameworks.

184
00:11:27,575 --> 00:11:31,805
Empower technical teams to
innovate solutions and maintain

185
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:34,355
progress momentum despite optical.

186
00:11:34,355 --> 00:11:39,095
So I think all these three factors will
be very critical, and I work on all

187
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:44,245
these types of problems in my day-to-day
SAP implementations that I work with.

188
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:48,705
Now let's look into the case study
how SAP and machine learning is

189
00:11:49,035 --> 00:11:52,710
helping out by taking an example
of Northeast Insurance growth.

190
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:58,560
Now if you see the graph itself indicates
there is a pre-implementation and

191
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,960
post-implementation claim processing time.

192
00:12:01,115 --> 00:12:04,625
We see that before SAP the claim
processing time is very high.

193
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,325
After SAP, the claim
processing time is very low.

194
00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:09,345
Same with policy insurance time.

195
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:13,020
Even the customer satisfaction,
how it has enhanced after SAP

196
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,090
and how it was less before SAP.

197
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,080
Then how the operating costs have changed,
how operating costs were high before

198
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,940
SAP, and how it has cut down the cost.

199
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:26,550
After SAP, so not insurance group, a
midsize regional insurer implemented

200
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:30,750
SAPS four HANA and integrated
machine learning capabilities

201
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,310
to transform their operations.

202
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:37,680
This, the company faced increasing
competition from digital first insurers.

203
00:12:38,055 --> 00:12:41,285
And struggling with aging systems
that that limited innovation.

204
00:12:41,975 --> 00:12:46,745
Their phase implementation approach,
prioritize claims processing and policy

205
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:51,065
administration with careful attention
to data migration and staff training.

206
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:56,165
They, the results were Ed
dramatically reduced processing

207
00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:58,905
times significantly significantly.

208
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:01,600
They had a good amount
of cost savings and.

209
00:13:02,305 --> 00:13:06,535
Remarkably improved customer
satisfaction scores that revised

210
00:13:06,935 --> 00:13:08,645
a declining market share trend.

211
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:12,665
So key takeaways and next
steps with this strategy is.

212
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,295
Strategic planning Align SAP
implementation with business Global

213
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:20,945
goals, team development, build cross
function expertise and leadership.

214
00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:22,445
Phased implementation.

215
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:26,825
Start with high impact areas for quick
wins and then continuous innovation.

216
00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:29,225
Leverage machine learning
for ongoing implement.

217
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:34,420
SAP Solutions Learning
Offer insurance companies.

218
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,660
Powerful tools to overcome
industry challenges and

219
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,980
drive digital transformation.

220
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,240
The companies that will thrive are
those whose leaders view technology

221
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,320
as a strategic enabler rather than
just an operational necessity.

222
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:52,070
We recommend being with a comprehensive
assessment of your current system

223
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:57,080
and processes to identify the highest
impact opportunities, develop the

224
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:03,740
a phase implementation roadmap that
balances goals, most importantly,

225
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,930
invest in developing both the technical
and leadership capabilities needed

226
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,720
to drive successful transformation.

227
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,015
Thank you, and thank you
for this opportunity.

228
00:14:15,495 --> 00:14:15,615
I.
