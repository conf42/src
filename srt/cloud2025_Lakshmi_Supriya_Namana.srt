1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,090
Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:05,730
Today, we're going to discuss DevOps
meets AI, automation cloud native

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,340
infrastructure with intelligent tools.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,170
Why use AI in DevOps?

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,570
DevOps is all about the speed,
automation, and continuous deliveries.

6
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:16,619
But as the system becomes
more complex, the traditional

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,369
method struggles to keep up.

8
00:00:18,799 --> 00:00:23,240
So AI brings intelligence to DevOps
to predict failures, optimize

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,860
cloud resources, automate tasks,
strengthening securities, and so on.

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,990
With AI, we can achieve higher
efficiencies, reducing downtime

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,530
and smoother operations.

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,190
What is the need for AI in DevOps?

13
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,840
So the challenges in traditional DevOps
are manual overload, complex natives,

14
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:46,219
security, and AI will enhancement with
intelligence monitoring, automated

15
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:48,090
security, and reduce the downtime.

16
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:52,250
Here we have some AI driven automation
in cloud related infrastructure.

17
00:00:52,655 --> 00:00:54,195
Key AI capabilities.

18
00:00:55,145 --> 00:00:56,035
Predictive analytics.

19
00:00:56,315 --> 00:00:58,745
It detects the system
failures before they occur.

20
00:00:58,745 --> 00:01:02,865
So that's much easier to
downtime the occurrence cause.

21
00:01:03,454 --> 00:01:04,835
And self healing system.

22
00:01:04,835 --> 00:01:08,155
So when it predicts itself,
heals and automates, then

23
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:09,935
resolute revolves the issue.

24
00:01:10,524 --> 00:01:13,585
And smart auto scaling adjusts
the resource dynamically.

25
00:01:13,925 --> 00:01:17,205
AI security and compliance
proactively prevents the threat.

26
00:01:18,115 --> 00:01:20,065
You have some key technologies in ai.

27
00:01:20,395 --> 00:01:23,485
AI, and DevOps is powered
by cutting edge technologies

28
00:01:23,485 --> 00:01:24,985
that include machine learning.

29
00:01:25,425 --> 00:01:28,785
AI learns data to predict
failures and improve automation.

30
00:01:29,195 --> 00:01:35,045
Natural language processing NLP helps AI
understand and generate humanlike text.

31
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:38,935
Computer vision, AI can
analyze and interrupt virtual

32
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:40,645
data for monitoring systems.

33
00:01:41,054 --> 00:01:46,244
Robot process automation, RPA,
automates repetitive DevOps tasks.

34
00:01:46,605 --> 00:01:51,085
Deep learning uses advanced neutral
networks to make intelligent decisions.

35
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:55,604
These are technologies that enable
AI resolution, DevOps workflow.

36
00:01:55,784 --> 00:01:58,725
Some real world examples
in AI, that's for Netflix.

37
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:05,170
It optimizes cloud performance for
seamless steaming and coming to Google it.

38
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:09,729
It detects and increases the
security for proactive threats.

39
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,640
And when we talk about AWS, it
automates the infrastructure management.

40
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,650
And while with GitHub it, it is used
with AI assisted coding, helps the

41
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,540
DevOps team to be more productive.

42
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,180
Let's discuss about some key
benefits of AI in DevOps.

43
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:30,025
So AI brings several key benefits out of
it, in which the faster software delivery,

44
00:02:30,305 --> 00:02:33,494
that is like it automates testing
and deployment for quicker releases.

45
00:02:34,665 --> 00:02:39,715
an improved reliability AI predict
failed use enhance system stability

46
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:43,795
better security AI continuously
monitor for threats and vulnerabilities

47
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:49,305
Optimized resource management AI ensures
efficient cloud usage reduces the

48
00:02:49,305 --> 00:02:53,605
cost enhanced developer productivity
AI assisted coding speeds of

49
00:02:53,855 --> 00:02:57,410
deployments Challenges of AI in DevOps.

50
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,630
While before in the before slide, we
have discussed some of the advantages,

51
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,250
but also that comes with the challenges.

52
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,220

00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,020
Security and privacy concerns.

57
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,460
AI systems must be secured,
compiled for the regulations.

58
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,390
Skill gap.

59
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,720
Teams need expertise in both AI and
DevOps for successful adoptions.

60
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,580
Overcoming these challenges
require careful planning,

61
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,530
investment, and upskills.

62
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,430
