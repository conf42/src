1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,463
thanks for the opportunity to talk about,
the library, Yeah, I in, disturb payments.

2
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:07,183
Basically, it's a great opportunity here.

3
00:00:07,293 --> 00:00:08,693
so I want to continue.

4
00:00:08,763 --> 00:00:12,323
I want to, take this time and then
thank you everybody, who is having,

5
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:15,633
the session and then who is attending
the session and then hope, after the

6
00:00:15,643 --> 00:00:20,193
session, you guys get to know more
about why we need AI in disturb payment

7
00:00:20,203 --> 00:00:22,273
security and this current world.

8
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:25,533
So I wanna I'll basically.

9
00:00:25,878 --> 00:00:28,308
Go through some of the slides I have.

10
00:00:28,408 --> 00:00:29,738
so yeah, let's get started.

11
00:00:30,088 --> 00:00:33,718
So the global, digital payment
market is rapidly basically

12
00:00:33,718 --> 00:00:35,648
expanding and throughout the world.

13
00:00:35,718 --> 00:00:41,878
And we are projecting this, payments
will exceed 15 trillion dollars by 2027.

14
00:00:42,338 --> 00:00:43,228
That's a huge number.

15
00:00:43,728 --> 00:00:47,458
Growth is basically followed by
increasing the number of factors,

16
00:00:47,468 --> 00:00:51,958
something like, contactless transaction,
evaluate and black chain based system.

17
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:53,358
So this kind of stuff.

18
00:00:53,398 --> 00:00:56,888
And then, however, this is like
a lot of, the pros comes with

19
00:00:56,898 --> 00:00:58,688
the cons and something like that.

20
00:00:58,788 --> 00:01:02,438
There are some, cyber threats,
online frauds that are happening.

21
00:01:02,788 --> 00:01:06,738
And then, that, that's a huge number
that we are talking right now.

22
00:01:06,738 --> 00:01:11,578
That number may reach by 48
billion annually by 2025.

23
00:01:12,088 --> 00:01:17,028
So this presentation explore basically,
the artificial intelligence is

24
00:01:17,088 --> 00:01:19,668
transforming to still a. Payment security.

25
00:01:19,668 --> 00:01:21,338
So why we need, artificial intelligence.

26
00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:25,178
we'll basically dive in, into the
realtime fraud detection, predictive risk

27
00:01:25,178 --> 00:01:28,088
analysis, and adapt to threat migration.

28
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:32,378
We'll showcase how a power
module, out perform in,

29
00:01:32,448 --> 00:01:34,218
traditional methods and discuss.

30
00:01:34,578 --> 00:01:40,068
Emerging things like quantum secure
inscription and adversarial AI ism.

31
00:01:40,338 --> 00:01:44,108
So paving the way for several
digital financial ecosystems.

32
00:01:44,748 --> 00:01:46,008
I'll move on to the next slide.

33
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,748
so the AI fraud detection, there
are like a different type of

34
00:01:49,998 --> 00:01:51,518
fraud detection that we could do.

35
00:01:51,768 --> 00:01:56,648
something like, I can explain something
like deep learning and all of my new

36
00:01:57,148 --> 00:02:00,798
So deep learning, when it comes to
deep learning, it's a neural network,

37
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:03,298
and a deep learning algorithm.

38
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:06,708
It's a kind of revolution, I would
say, and then, which basically detects

39
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:12,568
the fraud by analyzing millions of
transactions that happens in real time.

40
00:02:12,858 --> 00:02:16,748
And achieve the And 80
percent of improvement over

41
00:02:16,798 --> 00:02:18,368
traditional root based system.

42
00:02:18,418 --> 00:02:24,978
So these sophisticated models adapt and,
learn few new fraud pattern continuously.

43
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:28,658
and then when it comes to anomaly
detection, advanced mechanism,

44
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:33,788
advanced machine learning algorithm
process, complex transaction patterns.

45
00:02:34,518 --> 00:02:40,958
Use behavioral and constrictional data to
identify suspicious activities and then

46
00:02:41,388 --> 00:02:47,948
with more than 98 percent of accuracy, and
this precise dramatically reduce the false

47
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,788
alter while catching the genuine threats.

48
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:54,438
and then let's move on to
the productive analytics.

49
00:02:54,438 --> 00:02:58,738
That's a, and then there's a final
1 by analyzing the history of fraud

50
00:02:58,798 --> 00:03:00,868
patterns, and imaging the threats.

51
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:06,458
Basically, so AI powered protective
models enable financial institutions

52
00:03:06,528 --> 00:03:08,998
to prevent fraud before it occurs.

53
00:03:09,448 --> 00:03:12,408
Basically, when something is happening,
something is fraud happening.

54
00:03:12,698 --> 00:03:17,648
Basically, it, AI basically detects
this, and then the fraud is then

55
00:03:17,678 --> 00:03:19,228
saving the estimated savings.

56
00:03:19,538 --> 00:03:24,338
using AI, it's 12 billion
annually in potential losses.

57
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:31,023
yeah, this is huge, 12 billion annually
to save using the AI and why traditional

58
00:03:31,023 --> 00:03:36,683
security system rely on the rich rules
that, fraud ensures can study, explore,

59
00:03:36,993 --> 00:03:42,113
but AI power solution continuously
evolve to counter new threats.

60
00:03:42,573 --> 00:03:46,443
we can detect the things before it happens
and then we can save a lot of money.

61
00:03:46,783 --> 00:03:51,493
So basically, we doing, deep learning
algorithm Excel and, detecting

62
00:03:51,623 --> 00:03:55,823
the suitable patterns across the
billions of data points and enabling

63
00:03:56,153 --> 00:04:00,183
real time fraud prevention that
adopts imaging the attack vectors.

64
00:04:00,703 --> 00:04:06,083
So the intelligence and learning
approach not only minimize the financial

65
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,293
losses, but also enhance the customer.

66
00:04:08,778 --> 00:04:13,628
Trust by providing, frictional,
it's secure transaction, basically.

67
00:04:13,868 --> 00:04:15,358
yeah, move on to the next one.

68
00:04:15,858 --> 00:04:19,328
So let's talk about the real
time transaction monitoring.

69
00:04:19,588 --> 00:04:23,678
So there are like three things we
could do, reduce a fraud incident

70
00:04:23,748 --> 00:04:27,678
and then biometric integration and
then frictional experience, right?

71
00:04:28,248 --> 00:04:31,278
So basically when it comes to the
reduce the fraud incidents, using the

72
00:04:31,278 --> 00:04:36,558
advanced, AI monitoring system, and then
we can achieve basically reduction of

73
00:04:36,668 --> 00:04:40,848
30 percent of fraud incidents and then
saving the financial incidents over 2

74
00:04:41,618 --> 00:04:43,928
billion annual across the globe networks.

75
00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:48,178
That's a huge number, 2 billion and
it's across the, global networks.

76
00:04:48,178 --> 00:04:49,208
And then the second.

77
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:53,593
Thing that we could do biometric
integration, multi factor biometric,

78
00:04:53,843 --> 00:04:57,913
authentication combined, facial
recognition and then fingerprint

79
00:04:57,933 --> 00:05:01,613
scanning and then behavior
analysis created and what's well,

80
00:05:01,883 --> 00:05:04,763
implemented security still with a 99.

81
00:05:04,793 --> 00:05:05,553
9 accuracy.

82
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:07,083
that's very close to 100.

83
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:07,973
So 99.

84
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,523
9 accuracy where.

85
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:13,953
We can basically detect and then,
we can use a biometric integration.

86
00:05:14,203 --> 00:05:15,513
that's what we can do.

87
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:20,083
And then, frictional explore experience,
smart, bio biometric verification,

88
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:22,602
complete authentication in under 0.

89
00:05:22,683 --> 00:05:27,133
3 seconds, maintaining robust
security while delivering the

90
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:29,003
seamless payment experience.

91
00:05:29,023 --> 00:05:30,193
That rate is, the card.

92
00:05:30,973 --> 00:05:32,043
I'm gonna buy 25%.

93
00:05:32,103 --> 00:05:33,213
That's a huge number there.

94
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,983
And then the economy and then
where transactions occur a million,

95
00:05:37,263 --> 00:05:42,343
milliseconds, the real time monitoring
serves of the different payment security

96
00:05:42,393 --> 00:05:48,313
or algorithm process over 100, 000 data
points per second, where it flags lot

97
00:05:48,313 --> 00:05:51,257
of suspicious pattern, which allows.

98
00:05:51,757 --> 00:05:55,077
We're allowing the, legitimate
payments to go through, and then we

99
00:05:55,077 --> 00:05:59,002
can cut off the, theran, the kind
of fraud payments we can cut off,

100
00:05:59,002 --> 00:06:00,412
and then we can save a lot of money.

101
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:01,112
yeah.

102
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:04,802
And then, yeah, this is, we can use
these kind of realtime transaction

103
00:06:04,802 --> 00:06:08,192
monitoring over traditional method
to detect the fraud transaction.

104
00:06:08,552 --> 00:06:09,752
And let's move on to the next one.

105
00:06:10,312 --> 00:06:12,022
So the AI enable.

106
00:06:12,237 --> 00:06:13,537
blacks and security.

107
00:06:13,737 --> 00:06:18,397
So basically you can do the
A. I. In black chain security.

108
00:06:18,397 --> 00:06:22,367
You know how, it's very big
deal with black chain security.

109
00:06:22,627 --> 00:06:26,987
So the enhanced privacy, you can do the,
enhancing the privacy and then, federating

110
00:06:26,997 --> 00:06:29,217
the learning and then secure transaction.

111
00:06:29,217 --> 00:06:35,387
So basically there are, enhancing privacy,
I powered zero knowledge proves enables

112
00:06:35,817 --> 00:06:37,567
secure verification of transactions.

113
00:06:37,957 --> 00:06:42,357
Without revealing sensitivity details
and protecting the user privacy

114
00:06:42,357 --> 00:06:43,747
while maintaining the transparency.

115
00:06:43,777 --> 00:06:50,077
So basically, in nowadays, the privacy
is most interesting and then most thing

116
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:53,307
that people think about sharing that data.

117
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:58,747
by enhancing the privacy using
the AI and AI, which saves, a lot

118
00:06:58,747 --> 00:07:00,377
of stuff, and then it gives us.

119
00:07:00,942 --> 00:07:05,132
And hence, the zero knowledge proof
enables security verification.

120
00:07:05,182 --> 00:07:09,162
and then federated learning by
training the AI models basically

121
00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:14,342
across the distributed networks while
keeping data locally and, federated

122
00:07:14,612 --> 00:07:20,202
lending enables financial institution
to collaborate securely without

123
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:21,492
compromising the customer data.

124
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:22,132
So basically.

125
00:07:22,532 --> 00:07:27,132
You, whether compromising the customer
data, you can basically, go ahead and

126
00:07:27,142 --> 00:07:31,802
use the AI models and then, teach them
or, guide them, train the AI models

127
00:07:31,802 --> 00:07:36,252
and then get the, max, maximum out
of it for the customer that's using

128
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:40,002
the federated lending and then secure
transaction AI algorithm continuously

129
00:07:40,012 --> 00:07:42,352
monitor the blockchain transactions.

130
00:07:42,872 --> 00:07:47,342
And detecting anomalies and potential
threats in real time while maintaining

131
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,162
the immutable audit trails.

132
00:07:49,162 --> 00:07:54,042
So the secure transaction, basically
using the AI, in the real time, you

133
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:56,592
can detect the frauds just like that.

134
00:07:56,592 --> 00:08:02,252
And then you can save a lot of time, money
for the customer and for the institutions.

135
00:08:02,352 --> 00:08:02,652
yeah.

136
00:08:03,512 --> 00:08:04,632
And then the, the.

137
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:09,472
Convergency of blockchain and then
AI created a powerful foundation for

138
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:10,902
next generation payment security.

139
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:11,992
this is the future.

140
00:08:12,302 --> 00:08:16,872
So we're basically AI and enhanced
blockchain native security feature

141
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:18,972
by adding the intelligent threats.

142
00:08:19,557 --> 00:08:24,177
And detection and then privacy presuming
mechanism, through advanced techno

143
00:08:24,327 --> 00:08:29,897
techniques like zero knowledge proofs
and then federating the learning and

144
00:08:29,897 --> 00:08:34,757
then financial institution can now share
insight and valid transactions while.

145
00:08:35,257 --> 00:08:41,067
Maintaining strict data privacy standard
and leading 60% of detection in security

146
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:43,597
breaches and full, with global privacy.

147
00:08:44,517 --> 00:08:46,782
Yeah, that, that's what
we can do with blockchain.

148
00:08:47,282 --> 00:08:50,232
AI, let's move on to the
next one next topic here.

149
00:08:50,522 --> 00:08:55,332
And this is basically a case
study case studies in the industry

150
00:08:55,332 --> 00:08:56,812
leaders by industry leaders.

151
00:08:56,812 --> 00:09:03,442
so chargeback, reduction, leading, bank
have achieved a 40 percent reduction

152
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:08,472
in the chargeback prior and then, and,
savings over a hundred million annually

153
00:09:08,572 --> 00:09:10,482
through AI powered transaction validation.

154
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:15,543
Use AI validation, and then
which basically saves 100 million

155
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:19,943
annually, in the banking sector,
basically, or you take any kind of

156
00:09:19,963 --> 00:09:23,213
sector and then improve the speed.

157
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:25,143
So everybody want to work very speed.

158
00:09:25,143 --> 00:09:28,443
Everyone want to get the
results, in a time manner.

159
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:34,263
So global payments processes plus
a report 20 percent of 25 percent

160
00:09:34,263 --> 00:09:35,793
improvement in transactions.

161
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:36,663
That's a big number.

162
00:09:36,713 --> 00:09:38,773
25 percent is basically.

163
00:09:39,238 --> 00:09:45,698
You are basically improving the secured
payment methods by 25% and processing

164
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:51,048
over hundred thousand transactions per
second with, with the enhanced accuracy.

165
00:09:51,468 --> 00:09:55,618
So basically, you're doing with
using the, the, whatever industry re

166
00:09:55,798 --> 00:10:00,828
selling the hundred hundred thousand
transaction per second, enhance security.

167
00:10:01,328 --> 00:10:04,598
Basically, this is a power to system
have reduce a false positives.

168
00:10:05,098 --> 00:10:08,348
By 60 percent while blocking 99.

169
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:12,188
9 percent of fraudulent transactions.

170
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:17,068
it improves the 60 percent of the false
positives, where, so that, something

171
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:20,958
we usually get false positives nowadays
with using the traditional method.

172
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,068
significant improvement
in customer satisfaction.

173
00:10:23,478 --> 00:10:24,998
And then these partner improvements.

174
00:10:25,828 --> 00:10:30,038
Implementation by, these are all
pioneers implementation by major

175
00:10:30,038 --> 00:10:34,838
financial institution demonstrate
the, transformative power of AI

176
00:10:34,838 --> 00:10:38,568
payment security, but combining
mission learning with the traditional

177
00:10:38,588 --> 00:10:40,638
security measures and then.

178
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:45,518
These organizations have not only
strengthened their fraud detection at

179
00:10:45,518 --> 00:10:51,458
the same time, the, they enhance the
customer experience and then get the,

180
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:56,458
faster transactions and then get the
payments done very easily and they said,

181
00:10:56,508 --> 00:11:01,168
this is all like a blueprint border
financial industry adoption strategy and

182
00:11:01,168 --> 00:11:02,998
then let's move on to the next slide.

183
00:11:03,388 --> 00:11:05,688
the reduction in charge backfired.

184
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,808
If you look at the graph bank here.

185
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:14,213
Fitech B and payment process C, where
AI power, fraud detection system

186
00:11:14,213 --> 00:11:19,153
have demonstrated the remarkable
success in combating chargeback

187
00:11:19,193 --> 00:11:21,163
fraud across the financial sector.

188
00:11:21,253 --> 00:11:26,843
You can see here and then leading the
industry, a bank achieved an immense

189
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:30,123
42 percent reduction in fraud rental.

190
00:11:30,508 --> 00:11:35,738
Chartbacks through implementing advanced
mechanic machine learning algorithm.

191
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:39,528
So you implement the machine learning
algorithm in the payment level.

192
00:11:39,578 --> 00:11:45,168
And then basically, it will basically
deduct the 42 percent of the fraud,

193
00:11:45,418 --> 00:11:47,458
parental transactions or chartbacks.

194
00:11:47,978 --> 00:11:51,078
And then the FinTech B, if
you look at the FinTech B, a

195
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,658
solution delivered 30 percent of.

196
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:58,318
Decrease in the fraud under claims
while payment process see until

197
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:03,778
then system drove a substantial
of 40 percent improvement.

198
00:12:04,138 --> 00:12:07,718
So that's a big number 40 percent
improvement that gives that shows that,

199
00:12:08,268 --> 00:12:12,578
what is the reduction in charge back
for and then these results not only

200
00:12:13,218 --> 00:12:14,928
represent significant cost saving.

201
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,628
Potentially, millions of
dollars annually, basically.

202
00:12:18,768 --> 00:12:24,488
but also shows how AI driven
security solutions are, basically.

203
00:12:24,623 --> 00:12:28,703
all the AI driven security solutions,
how it is helping the payment

204
00:12:28,703 --> 00:12:33,833
system to basically improve the,
institutions, financial, and then,

205
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:37,443
of course, the customer service
to and the customer experience.

206
00:12:38,073 --> 00:12:40,463
if you look at the advancement
in transaction speed,

207
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:42,223
this is fascinating stuff.

208
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,743
AI powered, payment system.

209
00:12:45,263 --> 00:12:49,513
Our revolution transaction process across
the final sector, leading the transaction,

210
00:12:50,013 --> 00:12:55,583
the lead, leading the transformation is
company X with a remarkable 27 percent

211
00:12:55,673 --> 00:13:01,283
reduction in the processing time and
enable near institution payments, instance

212
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:07,913
payments for millions of customers and
company Z follows flows to 25 percent

213
00:13:08,073 --> 00:13:10,503
improvement while the company Y, okay.

214
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:12,953
Achieves a 23 percent boost.

215
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,363
So if you look at the numbers,
these are good numbers, which

216
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:20,093
has the customers, which had the
institutions, they're all using the

217
00:13:20,143 --> 00:13:22,973
algorithm and, optimization, they're.

218
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:25,728
Payment and then, customer experience.

219
00:13:25,728 --> 00:13:29,768
And then this is all the significant
improvement, translate directly

220
00:13:30,088 --> 00:13:31,478
enhance customer satisfaction.

221
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:36,408
So reduce the transaction amountment and
then stronger competitive and advantage

222
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:39,268
advantageous in digital payment landscape.

223
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,478
yeah, let's move on to the next slide.

224
00:13:41,978 --> 00:13:47,348
So the next generation security, we
were, we are talking about the next

225
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:52,678
generation security where basically
what coming so quantum security

226
00:13:52,758 --> 00:13:57,678
encryption implementing the post quantum
cryptography algorithm and then latency.

227
00:13:58,058 --> 00:14:02,028
based inscriptions and to safeguard
the financial data against,

228
00:14:02,548 --> 00:14:04,498
future quantum computing threats.

229
00:14:05,058 --> 00:14:07,468
this is all in all quantum
security encryption.

230
00:14:07,508 --> 00:14:08,588
We can do that.

231
00:14:08,588 --> 00:14:12,738
And then we can basically,
you know, we can basically,

232
00:14:13,358 --> 00:14:14,818
safeguard the financial data.

233
00:14:15,308 --> 00:14:18,938
And, the adversarial AI defense,
deploying the sophisticated, neural

234
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:24,408
networks and defensive algorithm to
detect and, neutralize AI powder attack

235
00:14:24,608 --> 00:14:26,928
targeting payment system, basically.

236
00:14:26,928 --> 00:14:32,448
So if you improve the adversarial
AI defense based and the deploying

237
00:14:32,948 --> 00:14:34,328
the sophisticated neural networks.

238
00:14:35,098 --> 00:14:40,248
and defensive algorithm to detect
the neutralized AI power attack.

239
00:14:40,438 --> 00:14:45,298
Any AI power attack we can basically
cut down, and then, target, which

240
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:49,168
basically target the payment
system, which is very important.

241
00:14:49,558 --> 00:14:54,438
And then enabling the AI, that is
called, XAI, and then integrated advanced

242
00:14:54,438 --> 00:15:00,238
model, interpretation, technique, and,
transparency frameworks, to ensure AI.

243
00:15:00,548 --> 00:15:01,378
discussions.

244
00:15:01,478 --> 00:15:06,548
all the decisions are traceable and then
complete with a regulatory standard.

245
00:15:06,548 --> 00:15:11,018
So the next generation AI
security using this three topics.

246
00:15:11,018 --> 00:15:14,448
And then we can basically advance
the security of each payment

247
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:16,458
and get the things done easily.

248
00:15:16,508 --> 00:15:21,618
And then basically this basically
provides and then avoid the threats.

249
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:27,543
to the future, next generation, or
any payment stuff, that's coming

250
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:30,373
to the, any institution, any,
especially financial institutions.

251
00:15:30,473 --> 00:15:33,553
together, this innovation from
a robust foundation for the

252
00:15:33,553 --> 00:15:36,533
future of payment security.

253
00:15:37,293 --> 00:15:37,673
yeah.

254
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:43,878
the interesting topic right now, why we
need, we spoke about AI and then, cyber

255
00:15:44,048 --> 00:15:48,308
attacks, and then, but the important
point, why we need to use AI instead of

256
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:52,668
the tradition way that is our traditional
method that we are using right now.

257
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:54,463
Very interesting thing, right?

258
00:15:54,733 --> 00:16:00,623
So yeah, using the ai, the of traditional
matter offers several advantages that

259
00:16:00,623 --> 00:16:05,063
can signifi significantly, improve the
performance efficiency, the scalability.

260
00:16:05,413 --> 00:16:07,643
So yeah, these are the
things that, you can improve.

261
00:16:07,853 --> 00:16:11,593
And then here are the, and some of the,
few things I'll go over right now, and

262
00:16:11,593 --> 00:16:17,113
then so that, you guys understand, why we
need ai, Instead of the traditional method

263
00:16:17,113 --> 00:16:21,993
that we have right now in any, financial
institute or any transactions, any payment

264
00:16:22,003 --> 00:16:24,053
transaction that we are using right now.

265
00:16:24,113 --> 00:16:27,283
So the first thing is
automation of repetitive tasks.

266
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:33,053
AI can handle repetitive and then mandate
task much more efficiently than human,

267
00:16:33,553 --> 00:16:37,093
which basically you can automate the
task and then you can get the results.

268
00:16:37,503 --> 00:16:41,283
Better than what we are doing by
traditional method, which is done

269
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:45,123
by humans right now, this allows the
employees to focus on, high level

270
00:16:45,443 --> 00:16:49,353
discussions, and then making creativity
and improving overall productivity.

271
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:54,743
whenever you're using the AI, which
basically does the automation on

272
00:16:54,743 --> 00:16:59,613
the repetitive task, and then which
will helps the all the employees.

273
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:05,353
Who is working in the institution,
which helps the productivity and

274
00:17:05,353 --> 00:17:11,643
then taking a good decisions and then
making, the all productivity good,

275
00:17:11,783 --> 00:17:13,713
improving the productivity basically.

276
00:17:14,003 --> 00:17:17,753
and then the 2nd thing we can do is
speed and accuracy using the eye.

277
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,743
A system can process a large amount
of data quickly and accurately,

278
00:17:21,743 --> 00:17:27,703
unlike a traditional method, which
is very useful for, a lot of,

279
00:17:27,753 --> 00:17:30,443
manual stuff that we are doing or
traditional stuff that we are doing.

280
00:17:30,753 --> 00:17:37,933
And then this analysis, sometimes
human may, face the error, but, in AI,

281
00:17:38,073 --> 00:17:41,913
you can handle tasks with a, greater
precision and real time, which is,

282
00:17:42,313 --> 00:17:45,673
like I mentioned in the previous slide
is You know, it's just like a false

283
00:17:45,703 --> 00:17:50,013
positive, you can basically have a lot
of false positive using the AI and then

284
00:17:50,013 --> 00:17:55,753
using, this, and then you can speed up
the transaction and the scalability,

285
00:17:55,753 --> 00:17:56,903
this is the biggest thing right now.

286
00:17:57,273 --> 00:17:59,023
It is scalable is the biggest
thing in any institution.

287
00:17:59,073 --> 00:18:03,933
a business grow at traditional
methods may struggle to keep up with

288
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:06,183
increasing volume of data and demand.

289
00:18:06,213 --> 00:18:10,173
And, yeah, if you look at the numbers
right now in any in the world.

290
00:18:10,418 --> 00:18:16,028
The payments, the digital payments are
increasing a lot, and then the scalability

291
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,298
for institution is the biggest thing.

292
00:18:17,298 --> 00:18:20,568
So if you look at the demand
is very high day by day.

293
00:18:20,568 --> 00:18:25,868
So A can scale to handle vast
amounts of data and complex tasks

294
00:18:26,108 --> 00:18:27,743
without compromising the performance.

295
00:18:27,743 --> 00:18:31,768
So making it ideal for large
organization or, those with a

296
00:18:31,768 --> 00:18:32,958
rapid growth, like I mentioned.

297
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:37,088
If an institution is increasing their
rapid growth, you can basically,

298
00:18:37,328 --> 00:18:41,608
make sure that you're using the
AI and then it will basically help

299
00:18:41,608 --> 00:18:43,618
you finding the things for you.

300
00:18:43,868 --> 00:18:45,228
And then, that's a good thing.

301
00:18:45,278 --> 00:18:48,768
And then, of course, cost
efficiency, while there might be

302
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:51,028
upfront cost implementing the AI.

303
00:18:51,323 --> 00:18:54,713
But over the time, it can reduce the
operational cost by automating the

304
00:18:54,863 --> 00:18:58,873
task and then, reducing the errors
and, streamlining the workflow.

305
00:18:59,243 --> 00:19:04,923
This can lead long term, savings and
then better allocation of resources.

306
00:19:05,473 --> 00:19:10,933
data driven insight, AI can,
analyze large, data sets and

307
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:12,488
then uncover the patterns.

308
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:18,778
Or friends that would be difficult or,
what I'm going to say, time consuming

309
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:23,568
for the human to spot, sometimes,
we, we do a lot of errors with a

310
00:19:23,578 --> 00:19:25,588
human error that happens everywhere.

311
00:19:25,608 --> 00:19:29,748
it's, it's sometimes it's time consuming
as well when we do some kind of error.

312
00:19:29,748 --> 00:19:30,608
So with AI.

313
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:36,313
we can save a lot of time and then,
this leads to more information, informed

314
00:19:36,313 --> 00:19:41,303
decision making and then improved for
forecast and ability to take, proactive

315
00:19:41,893 --> 00:19:48,803
actions or steps that can, that can
give a lot of time to the organization

316
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:54,483
and then good customer experience and
personalization AI enable highly me.

317
00:19:54,988 --> 00:20:00,518
Personalized experience by analyzing
individual user behavior, for example,

318
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:05,098
AI driven recommendation, engines
like, those used by Netflix, Amazon

319
00:20:05,098 --> 00:20:10,288
right now provide the user a tailored
solution, which difficult to achieve

320
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:11,258
with the traditional approach.

321
00:20:11,308 --> 00:20:14,338
So when you're basically watching
a movie and then when you're doing

322
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,768
something in Netflix, Amazon,
you'll get the solution, which.

323
00:20:18,493 --> 00:20:23,263
Right now, it's, compared to if
you use a I, what we are doing

324
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:26,753
in a traditional method, you'll
see a lot of improvement in that.

325
00:20:26,853 --> 00:20:31,793
yeah, that's about why we need
to use the instead of traditional

326
00:20:32,293 --> 00:20:33,883
way that we are using right now.

327
00:20:34,273 --> 00:20:35,693
Let's move on to the next slide.

328
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,363
Though, yeah, quantum security encryption.

329
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:43,073
so as a quantum computing advanced at
the unprecedented pace, you look at the,

330
00:20:43,353 --> 00:20:47,163
world right now, everybody, and then
most of the people are fascinated about

331
00:20:47,173 --> 00:20:49,513
the quantum, computing, what it does.

332
00:20:49,993 --> 00:20:52,913
What and why we need quantum computing.

333
00:20:52,963 --> 00:20:56,193
I'm also very fascinated about
quantum computing and then so

334
00:20:56,513 --> 00:20:59,663
it presents a critical challenge
to the digital payment industry.

335
00:20:59,713 --> 00:21:03,233
So today encryption methods,
which they've got a billions of

336
00:21:03,693 --> 00:21:08,423
financial transaction could be
rendered absolute and which powerful

337
00:21:08,463 --> 00:21:10,633
quantum computer become a reality.

338
00:21:10,653 --> 00:21:15,438
And this looming thread has
sparked the Development of

339
00:21:15,438 --> 00:21:16,888
quantum security encryption.

340
00:21:17,018 --> 00:21:21,748
So the revolutionary approach to
protecting sensitivity financial data.

341
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:25,558
So leading financial institutions
are already exploring the

342
00:21:25,568 --> 00:21:29,048
breakthrough solutions, latency
based cryptography, which.

343
00:21:29,533 --> 00:21:35,483
Create the mathematical problem and that
even quantum computer can't easily solve

344
00:21:35,913 --> 00:21:41,603
the other promising approaches including
code base and multivariate Cryptography,

345
00:21:41,603 --> 00:21:47,623
so there are a lot of issues in using
cryptography right now Which basically

346
00:21:48,123 --> 00:21:52,263
even you know using the cryptography
sometime we fail, but Yeah, a lot of

347
00:21:52,273 --> 00:21:56,713
interest in going with crypto right now,
each offering unique difference mechanism

348
00:21:56,823 --> 00:21:58,523
and then against quantum attacks.

349
00:21:58,523 --> 00:22:02,603
So by proactively implementing
these quantum resistance method,

350
00:22:02,883 --> 00:22:07,833
bank and payment, provide can
future proof their security,

351
00:22:07,883 --> 00:22:10,578
infrastructure and maintain the trust.

352
00:22:11,008 --> 00:22:15,698
Of their customers, in a increasingly
complex technology, technical landscape.

353
00:22:15,778 --> 00:22:17,968
yeah, let's move on to the next slide.

354
00:22:18,468 --> 00:22:23,528
adversarial AI defense, in digital,
payment, landscape, criminal, the

355
00:22:23,528 --> 00:22:28,538
cyber criminals are increasing,
increasingly using adversary AI.

356
00:22:28,878 --> 00:22:33,648
To our smart security system, these,
sophisticated attacks, work by,

357
00:22:34,148 --> 00:22:36,038
manipulating the transaction data.

358
00:22:36,078 --> 00:22:41,698
For example, let's say, just in the,
adjusting purchase pattern or transaction

359
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:47,038
timestamp in a way that appear normal
to AI fraud detection system, but

360
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,628
actually fraud and also think of it.

361
00:22:49,878 --> 00:22:56,098
As a creating a blind spot in a
vision and allowing a transaction

362
00:22:56,118 --> 00:22:57,538
to slip through the notice.

363
00:22:57,568 --> 00:23:02,828
So financial institutions are
fighting back with a robust advice.

364
00:23:02,888 --> 00:23:04,428
a different strategy in the AI.

365
00:23:04,928 --> 00:23:09,198
Now, financial companies or financial
institution thinking about how to

366
00:23:09,198 --> 00:23:11,738
use AI through addressing training.

367
00:23:11,738 --> 00:23:15,308
Basically, you're training the AI
and then you're giving the, you're

368
00:23:15,348 --> 00:23:20,208
supporting with a lot of data as
systems exposed, simulated attacks

369
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:23,328
and building the resistance,
vaccines, strengthen the immunity.

370
00:23:23,858 --> 00:23:27,208
yeah, this is how an adversarial
AI defense should work.

371
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,598
And then, that helps
a lot of institutions.

372
00:23:29,598 --> 00:23:33,518
So the key takeaways, from this,
from this meeting or from this,

373
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:37,698
stuff, what I'm trying to do is
AI is essential, basically, and

374
00:23:37,698 --> 00:23:39,308
then it's a continuous adoption.

375
00:23:39,348 --> 00:23:41,828
So we're getting into AI world.

376
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:44,588
we're starting which the AI is.

377
00:23:45,113 --> 00:23:50,323
helping in all the way and every
sector, but keep the customer data,

378
00:23:50,703 --> 00:23:54,653
secure and then keep the payment,
keep the digital mechanism secure.

379
00:23:55,223 --> 00:24:01,673
We need AI, which basically AI basically
solve a lot of problems, especially the

380
00:24:01,693 --> 00:24:05,663
payment, payment securities enabling 99.

381
00:24:05,663 --> 00:24:08,073
9 accurate and a percent of
accurate fraud detection.

382
00:24:08,103 --> 00:24:10,143
And that's basically.

383
00:24:10,873 --> 00:24:12,943
It's not, it's a huge number, 99.

384
00:24:13,003 --> 00:24:15,703
9, fraud detection is very huge number.

385
00:24:15,743 --> 00:24:18,803
And then it happens in, hours
to milliseconds right now.

386
00:24:19,443 --> 00:24:24,233
So using the AI, you can get that accuracy
in milliseconds and continuous adoption.

387
00:24:24,343 --> 00:24:28,593
Of course, the, any organization,
anything investing emergent technology,

388
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:33,073
quantum resistance and encryption
and adversarial AI defense to stay

389
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:35,413
ahead of evolving cyber threats.

390
00:24:35,913 --> 00:24:41,063
First of the collaboration, cross industry
partnership, threat intelligence, sharing

391
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:45,713
the networks are vital for detecting the
emerging attacks, pattern and developing

392
00:24:45,713 --> 00:24:47,343
the standardized security protocol.

393
00:24:47,443 --> 00:24:52,303
yeah, so the integration of AI
payment security as more optional,

394
00:24:52,603 --> 00:24:54,943
optimal, optional to the emeritus.

395
00:24:55,013 --> 00:24:56,453
Basically, we have to use it.

396
00:24:56,843 --> 00:24:58,563
It's essential right now.

397
00:24:59,003 --> 00:25:01,693
What we are seeing the AI
is getting in all sector.

398
00:25:01,928 --> 00:25:06,678
we have to take this and we have to adapt
the technology and then we have to use it

399
00:25:06,678 --> 00:25:12,668
for a good reason and then make sure that
it is helping the And then it's basically,

400
00:25:13,058 --> 00:25:16,598
we are talking about the transaction
right now, the payment transaction.

401
00:25:16,628 --> 00:25:17,768
It has so much.

402
00:25:17,848 --> 00:25:23,178
And then by taking those, concrete steps,
the audits and, regular security, the

403
00:25:23,178 --> 00:25:28,668
organization can build a foundation for
secure and resilient payment system.

404
00:25:29,563 --> 00:25:30,953
For future for tomorrow.

405
00:25:31,723 --> 00:25:32,063
Yeah.

406
00:25:32,093 --> 00:25:36,423
that's conclude my session on
the, how are we going to use AI?

407
00:25:36,473 --> 00:25:38,683
Why are you, why it is so useful?

408
00:25:39,063 --> 00:25:45,213
and then, why we need AI, and then how
it is helps to secure the data, the

409
00:25:45,213 --> 00:25:48,213
customer, and then giving the basically
more productivity for the employee.
