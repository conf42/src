1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,940
Optimizing AI interactions.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,269
So techniques in prompt engineering
for enhanced model performance.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:11,209
So in coming to introduction to
prompt engineering is a new area

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:16,990
where we should know how to ask
questions, how to instruct an AI model.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,970
So it is called prompting.

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,390
Prompting is an art.

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,650
So to get a best response,
we should prompt effectively.

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,910
The more focused we are into prompting,
the more effective we get out.

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,560
Practicing prompt engineering will enhance
the AI model performance and usability.

10
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:37,079
It will improve the response
that we are supposed to get.

11
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,070
There are different AI
models, in market right now.

12
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,840
The OpenAI, started with GPT 3.

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,440
Now it is with GPT 4.

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,370
And we do have image generation
model called Dell, E.

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,213
We are using multiple generative AI
models like Meta, Chad GPT, Microsoft

16
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:57,423
Copilot, et cetera, and everyone has
started using now these AI models.

17
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,883
So how to use these AI models effectively?

18
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:07,163
So we need to know about prompting, which
will get the response from the AI models.

19
00:01:07,163 --> 00:01:11,296
Every AI model generates outputs
based on patterns in the data.

20
00:01:11,296 --> 00:01:16,191
They have been trained on prompt quality,
directly provide the user quality results.

21
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:19,803
Roles of prompt engineering
in working with AI models.

22
00:01:20,378 --> 00:01:25,499
So basically, a prompt is an input or
query that a user asks an AI model.

23
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:27,907
Say for example, what is
the temperature today?

24
00:01:27,907 --> 00:01:30,014
What is the temperature
in California today?

25
00:01:30,014 --> 00:01:31,820
More specific query if you want.

26
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,131
it should have variable prompts
which will give us various results

27
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:36,937
even if the question is same.

28
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:41,327
So the prompt should be clear,
specific, it should have a context.

29
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:43,847
Then we will get the best response.

30
00:01:44,657 --> 00:01:46,577
Structured prompts produce best results.

31
00:01:47,027 --> 00:01:52,827
Now, how to structure a prompt for
getting a best result from an AI model?

32
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:53,607
Let us see.

33
00:01:54,437 --> 00:01:59,387
For that, we should know about different
prompts, different types of prompts.

34
00:01:59,927 --> 00:02:01,797
There are instructional prompts.

35
00:02:01,877 --> 00:02:06,887
Instructional prompts, we can request AI
to produce a specific format of style.

36
00:02:06,887 --> 00:02:13,741
Say, for example, we can, ask to write a
poem with 10 lines or write a poem on this

37
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:16,451
context, write a poem on about flowers.

38
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:19,101
Some instruction we can give to AI.

39
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:20,841
AI will respond us.

40
00:02:21,256 --> 00:02:26,336
As we need, it can write stories, it can
write essays, it can write poems, it can

41
00:02:26,336 --> 00:02:30,576
write cover letters, resumes, depends
upon the input we are giving, that are

42
00:02:30,576 --> 00:02:32,306
all the instructions we are giving.

43
00:02:32,826 --> 00:02:35,566
In some cases, we might
need to give a context.

44
00:02:35,646 --> 00:02:40,016
Say for example, some strategies
of business growth based on current

45
00:02:40,116 --> 00:02:43,856
economic trend, the context we are
setting as current economic trend.

46
00:02:44,276 --> 00:02:48,256
So the contextual prompts basically
provide the background information,

47
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:52,801
So that AI can, shape its
response according to the context.

48
00:02:53,331 --> 00:02:55,691
Next one coming is the interactive prompt.

49
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:59,261
So to generate various
perspectives interactively.

50
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:02,581
We can talk to AI like a
human in a discussion mode.

51
00:03:02,991 --> 00:03:05,051
For example, about the current election.

52
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:06,706
What do you think of the current election?

53
00:03:06,846 --> 00:03:07,446
Who will win?

54
00:03:07,776 --> 00:03:09,566
What is the possibility of winning?

55
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:11,126
We can keep asking questions.

56
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:12,196
They can keep answering.

57
00:03:12,486 --> 00:03:14,526
So they will give multiple responses.

58
00:03:14,616 --> 00:03:17,136
So there are, these are the
three different type of prompts.

59
00:03:17,136 --> 00:03:20,786
Instructional prompts, contextual
prompts, and interactive prompts.

60
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:24,446
Now we come to know
about different prompts.

61
00:03:24,726 --> 00:03:28,421
Next question is, What are all
the techniques for optimizing

62
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:31,001
this, prompt more effectively?

63
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:36,131
The first thing is, it should
be more specific, be specific.

64
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:39,973
More details in your prompts will
provide you more accurate results.

65
00:03:39,973 --> 00:03:46,156
For example, asking for a diet plan
to change the PT Generate UI model.

66
00:03:46,156 --> 00:03:49,236
What is the best diet plan for, for a day?

67
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:50,446
That is a general question.

68
00:03:51,046 --> 00:03:56,336
If you are asking for an adult, for 36
years of age, or for a kid, or, South

69
00:03:56,336 --> 00:04:01,076
Indian, or, American dishes, likewise,
if we give more specific, items,

70
00:04:01,126 --> 00:04:03,166
we will get more specific answers.

71
00:04:03,736 --> 00:04:06,616
Apart from that, we
can give examples also.

72
00:04:06,616 --> 00:04:17,136
I will be coming to the example section
so that I can explain them in detail.

73
00:04:17,636 --> 00:04:22,846
So after that, the next step for
effective, Prompt is setting context.

74
00:04:23,526 --> 00:04:28,206
We have to ask prompt, say for
example, about the election in

75
00:04:28,206 --> 00:04:29,966
the current election context.

76
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:35,766
If we are asking, chat GPT or any AI model
about what do you think about election?

77
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,536
They will give general answer only.

78
00:04:37,826 --> 00:04:41,116
But if you are asking a query, what
do you think about election, current

79
00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:45,576
American election, then we will get the
exact response which we are looking into.

80
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:49,876
And also same like tone, set
the tone level of formality.

81
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:55,526
Let us validate some examples, some case
studies, how prompt engineering works.

82
00:04:56,016 --> 00:04:59,016
I'm asking a query, give me
a balanced diet for a day.

83
00:04:59,706 --> 00:05:00,676
what is the response?

84
00:05:00,776 --> 00:05:04,606
See, the response looks like a
balanced diet, given some explanation

85
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:09,076
about the balanced diet, and they
are giving breakfast, multiple

86
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:10,696
options, mid morning snacks.

87
00:05:11,296 --> 00:05:12,876
and multiple options they are giving.

88
00:05:13,026 --> 00:05:14,216
That's a big response.

89
00:05:14,986 --> 00:05:18,656
Now I'm planning to give more
clear and specific prompt.

90
00:05:19,156 --> 00:05:23,686
Give me a balanced diet for a day
for a six year old girl child.

91
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:28,916
Now the prompt answer is different because
I really want a six year old, girl child

92
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,076
diet, but I'm asking a balanced diet.

93
00:05:31,106 --> 00:05:31,676
It's a general question.

94
00:05:31,676 --> 00:05:33,276
It will be common for everyone.

95
00:05:33,776 --> 00:05:38,051
Now, if the question is more specific
with six year old child, It is giving

96
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:42,061
about, the, the kid's explanation and
the breakfast option with morning style.

97
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:43,221
The option got changed.

98
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:46,111
The option is more specific
to a six year old child.

99
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:48,991
let us give more context also.

100
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:51,791
Say, for example, the same,
give me a balanced diet.

101
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:56,161
For a 10-year-old boy
with an issue in eyesight.

102
00:05:56,221 --> 00:06:00,091
So issue in eyesight can, can be
with, nutritional deficiencies also.

103
00:06:00,251 --> 00:06:07,041
the GPT model, the AI model, has taken
the eyesight issue as a context, and it

104
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:12,331
is considering the 10-year-old boy and
also after calculating all the, details

105
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,941
from internet, it's, giving a, response.

106
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,811
specific to the context which we need.

107
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:22,251
as we discussed, in the previous slides,
there are different type of prompts,

108
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:26,411
instructional prompts, interactive
prompts, setting examples in prompts, etc.

109
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:28,891
Let us see how instructional prompt works.

110
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:33,531
Now I'm asking, the AI model to
give me the response in bullet

111
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,461
points with maximum 10 lines.

112
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:38,651
I already have a, response
in the previous slide.

113
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:42,014
If you see in the previous slide,
I already have some response with

114
00:06:42,014 --> 00:06:48,111
some explanations, tip, et cetera,
but I want the response in lists.

115
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:51,781
I'm giving the response and
I am setting a limit of 10.

116
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:56,011
and I want everything
to be in bullet points.

117
00:06:56,201 --> 00:06:57,121
So what happens?

118
00:06:57,221 --> 00:07:01,381
It has reduced, the explanation
description, but all the points

119
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:03,211
it has given in bullet points.

120
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:07,151
And if you count, it will not go
beyond 10 lines because I have

121
00:07:07,151 --> 00:07:09,691
limited them to responding 10 lines.

122
00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:10,501
Same way.

123
00:07:10,996 --> 00:07:14,096
They say, let us try with
interactive prompt option.

124
00:07:14,376 --> 00:07:19,096
So now I have a, a diet plan for a
10 year old, boy with eyesight issue.

125
00:07:19,386 --> 00:07:23,456
Now I am thinking whether the eyesight
is only because of the nutritional

126
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:25,206
issue or any other issues are there.

127
00:07:25,406 --> 00:07:25,906
I don't know.

128
00:07:26,206 --> 00:07:27,726
I just want to interact with someone.

129
00:07:28,116 --> 00:07:30,336
So I'm interacting with the AI model.

130
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:34,656
I'm asking him, what do you
think that causes issues in

131
00:07:34,726 --> 00:07:36,896
eyesight of 10 year old boy?

132
00:07:37,396 --> 00:07:39,296
Now I'm giving some instruction also here.

133
00:07:39,456 --> 00:07:42,446
Give me the response in a
paragraph of five sentences.

134
00:07:43,116 --> 00:07:47,816
Now the AI with all the possible issues.

135
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:51,906
Excessive screen time, genetic
factors, nutrition, lack of proper

136
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:57,056
nutrition, bright light exposure,
UV rays, smoking, all the list,

137
00:07:57,146 --> 00:07:58,946
all the possible list it is giving.

138
00:07:59,286 --> 00:08:02,906
And also it is limiting to a
paragraph of five sentences.

139
00:08:03,326 --> 00:08:05,701
Now I can ask again on top of this.

140
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:08,581
On top of this, like what
about the genetic factor?

141
00:08:08,741 --> 00:08:10,121
What about excessive screen time?

142
00:08:10,441 --> 00:08:11,831
How should be the excessive screen time?

143
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:14,251
It will give, keep giving the answer.

144
00:08:14,671 --> 00:08:18,801
So in advanced prompt
engineering, techniques also.

145
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:23,141
Now this interactive prompting,
we, it can be done iteratively.

146
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:27,351
For example, what are all the genetic
factors can be, the cause of eyesight,

147
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:31,946
a model can respond with all the
genetic factors and the user can

148
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:33,961
compare it with their own, requirements.

149
00:08:34,021 --> 00:08:36,271
Accordingly, it will,
ask again the questions.

150
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:42,021
And also for lack of proper nutrition,
if we can ask on top of this interactive

151
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,981
prompt, if we can ask about lack of
nutrition, then it will explain more

152
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:49,858
about the, what are all the nutrients like
vitamin A, B, what are all the nutrients

153
00:08:49,868 --> 00:08:52,018
which are required for a proper nutrition.

154
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:54,998
Then we can think about, the diet plan.

155
00:08:55,058 --> 00:08:55,448
Okay.

156
00:08:55,508 --> 00:08:58,888
So this kid is having a
vitamin A carats every day.

157
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,448
So we don't need a vitamin
A, again on this plan.

158
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,008
or we can ask how much
vitamin A is required.

159
00:09:05,348 --> 00:09:08,238
So that, how this iterative
process will go on.

160
00:09:08,568 --> 00:09:11,238
It's like we can interact
with the normal human beings.

161
00:09:11,738 --> 00:09:15,328
And for the further questions, we
don't need to ask the same question

162
00:09:15,328 --> 00:09:18,958
again, we just need to ask about
what are all the vitamins required.

163
00:09:19,168 --> 00:09:19,768
That's it.

164
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:23,768
If we ask what are all the vitamins
required, the AI model will understand

165
00:09:23,768 --> 00:09:25,188
the context from the previous.

166
00:09:25,883 --> 00:09:32,063
Prompt it will set the context that this
user is asking about a 10 year old boy

167
00:09:32,473 --> 00:09:36,803
and the issue is eyesight and they are
thinking about improving the nutrition.

168
00:09:37,063 --> 00:09:40,813
So this what are all the victims this
question is related to that context.

169
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:46,973
It will automatically assume that is the
beauty of this AI generative AI models.

170
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:52,303
We can set examples also in the
prompt so that GPT will, GPT model

171
00:09:52,303 --> 00:09:53,848
will understand that example.

172
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:56,568
and give the result in the same way.

173
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:58,688
Give me the same response.

174
00:09:58,758 --> 00:09:59,298
I'm asking.

175
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,668
I already have a response.

176
00:10:00,748 --> 00:10:02,638
But I, it doesn't look good for me.

177
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:03,678
Now I'm asking.

178
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:06,108
Give me the same response
in different way.

179
00:10:06,108 --> 00:10:07,928
For example, I'm giving an example.

180
00:10:07,928 --> 00:10:10,838
For example, genetic factors
need to be a heading.

181
00:10:11,408 --> 00:10:12,308
Give an explanation.

182
00:10:12,598 --> 00:10:14,418
Excessive screen time
need to be a heading.

183
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:15,798
Give an explanation.

184
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:17,838
Now, see the surprise.

185
00:10:18,338 --> 00:10:19,018
The breakdown.

186
00:10:19,228 --> 00:10:22,203
They are giving genetic
factors and given all the list.

187
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:25,133
excessive screen time,
given all the descriptions.

188
00:10:25,603 --> 00:10:28,703
The same way they are responding.

189
00:10:29,203 --> 00:10:32,003
This is how we will set
the examples in the prompt.

190
00:10:32,503 --> 00:10:38,523
Apart from that one, there are multiple
advanced prompting techniques also called

191
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:44,793
few short learning, chain of thought
prompting, tree of thought prompting, etc.

192
00:10:45,538 --> 00:10:50,598
In few short learning, we can give
few, we already saw in that, context

193
00:10:50,688 --> 00:10:54,128
setting example in the previous,
slide, setting examples in the prompt,

194
00:10:54,628 --> 00:10:56,820
setting examples in the prompt.

195
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,548
This example I have given only one item.

196
00:11:00,048 --> 00:11:05,328
If we are able to give more and more
examples, AI will understand the context.

197
00:11:05,653 --> 00:11:10,583
And gives the more and more specific
response, which exactly we need To

198
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:14,823
provide a few more examples for desired
outcome to help the model generalize

199
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:19,843
And also show in chat gpt how they will
arrange output in list bullet point, etc.

200
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:24,073
This is just an example and What
about chain of thought prompting?

201
00:11:24,493 --> 00:11:28,123
Chain of thought prompting will be
encouraging the model to explain

202
00:11:28,123 --> 00:11:29,833
its reasoning step by step.

203
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:34,203
So for example, they're telling genetic
factors, the, they're mentioning some

204
00:11:34,203 --> 00:11:38,853
reason like if the, if there is a family
history of vision problems such as

205
00:11:38,853 --> 00:11:43,353
myopia and astigmatism, child is more
likely to in inherit these conditions.

206
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:47,283
This is what they mentioned in the genetic
factors and the genetics play more role

207
00:11:47,283 --> 00:11:48,603
in determining child's psych health.

208
00:11:49,103 --> 00:11:52,503
Now, we are thinking, so whether
any family member is having myopia,

209
00:11:52,823 --> 00:11:54,273
whether the kid also will get it.

210
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,763
we are thinking about
the, AI models reasoning.

211
00:11:56,763 --> 00:12:00,613
We can question it, we can question
it, why are you thinking if a

212
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:05,633
family, history of a vision problem
is there with myopia, the kid also

213
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:07,953
should, what is the possibility,
what is the percentage of myopia?

214
00:12:07,973 --> 00:12:10,253
getting that one for the kids.

215
00:12:10,273 --> 00:12:11,713
we can ask for more reasoning.

216
00:12:12,053 --> 00:12:15,073
If we ask for more reasoning, they
will get more specific, we will

217
00:12:15,113 --> 00:12:16,683
get more specific answers of that.

218
00:12:17,093 --> 00:12:20,533
model will be encouraged to
explain the reasoning step by step.

219
00:12:20,813 --> 00:12:21,773
They will give more examples.

220
00:12:22,548 --> 00:12:26,378
So there are this much population in
such a place and in that place this

221
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:30,138
much people had myopia and their
kids has been identified with myopia.

222
00:12:30,538 --> 00:12:33,568
So this is a reason why they
are telling the family history

223
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,188
will impact their eyesight.

224
00:12:35,258 --> 00:12:38,748
Likewise, model can explain
it like a human being, like

225
00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:41,772
a doctor, like a, advisor.

226
00:12:42,272 --> 00:12:46,382
And, this AI models can act as
our supervisor, our juniors.

227
00:12:46,452 --> 00:12:48,092
We can ask them to write coding.

228
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:51,162
We can ask them to write a
program, develop an application.

229
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:52,932
This text, it's amazing.

230
00:12:53,012 --> 00:12:53,662
It's amazing.

231
00:12:54,002 --> 00:12:57,432
Ask question again from the
response, which is already given.

232
00:12:57,432 --> 00:12:58,122
It is possible.

233
00:12:58,282 --> 00:13:00,362
This interaction can go for hours.

234
00:13:00,872 --> 00:13:02,832
It will, they will never get tired.

235
00:13:03,112 --> 00:13:05,762
They will, we will get more
and more specific answers.

236
00:13:06,032 --> 00:13:13,782
To get an AI model in its maximum
effective way, the only possibility

237
00:13:13,782 --> 00:13:18,372
is to send an effective prompting
like chain of thought prompting.

238
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:24,212
Now the next advanced technique is tree
of thoughts interacting the model to share

239
00:13:24,222 --> 00:13:25,972
a different perspective of the response.

240
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,392
in a single response, you'll be having
different, ways of approaching it.

241
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:34,372
So that one, a response, AI models
can give different perspective of the

242
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:37,472
response and are from those perspectives.

243
00:13:37,512 --> 00:13:42,452
A user can read and identify which
perspective they are looking into it and

244
00:13:42,492 --> 00:13:45,162
that perspective we can ask them again.

245
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:52,566
this, GPT models, they are, AI models can
help us help our, help us for, writing

246
00:13:52,596 --> 00:13:57,876
codes, any code, like we can, writing
codes reviewing and, and trouble shooting

247
00:13:57,876 --> 00:14:00,306
issues, possible trouble shooting issues.

248
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,900
We can, it's.

249
00:14:01,911 --> 00:14:02,361
It's covered.

250
00:14:02,361 --> 00:14:06,761
It depends upon how much data set they
have covered in their AI model, that much

251
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:13,431
coverage if we can get from them instead
of, searching in Google, the same data is

252
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:18,601
getting trained by the AI model means what
we are asking effectively in the prompt

253
00:14:18,651 --> 00:14:20,441
we will get in the most effective way.

254
00:14:20,941 --> 00:14:23,001
Now, we got a response.

255
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:24,571
Can we believe it?

256
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:26,441
100 percent right.

257
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:28,491
Of course, we cannot believe it.

258
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:29,341
Why?

259
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:29,771
Only because.

260
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:34,481
Every AI model is trained
for a set of data.

261
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:37,151
how far, how vast is that data?

262
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:41,431
How see if it is, from like
Google covered the details.

263
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:46,381
The same VA model covered the entire,
Wikipedia or entire Google and entire

264
00:14:46,381 --> 00:14:50,251
internet depends upon the coverage
of the data, which they have done.

265
00:14:50,736 --> 00:14:54,485
They will, get us the response
and also from their training data,

266
00:14:54,486 --> 00:14:55,636
they will get us the response.

267
00:14:56,056 --> 00:15:01,576
we, it is our responsibility not to
relay the response 100%, instead validate

268
00:15:01,576 --> 00:15:04,136
the response whether it is matching.

269
00:15:04,516 --> 00:15:06,015
Whether it is relevant.

270
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:10,785
If we are asking about election and
is it is relevant to what I am asking

271
00:15:11,095 --> 00:15:13,015
instead of considering the result as such.

272
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:14,305
Is it is relevant?

273
00:15:14,315 --> 00:15:15,855
Is the response relevant to the problem?

274
00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:19,725
Whether the response is
logically structured and is it

275
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:21,205
understandable for the user?

276
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:22,925
Whether it is easy to follow?

277
00:15:23,775 --> 00:15:27,490
And A double confirmation is
required, whether it is accurate.

278
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:33,990
This, if we are asking for some financial
figures of the growth of a company,

279
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,316
then the model will give a result.

280
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:42,310
And if we are searching it in
the latest result in internet, we

281
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,510
might be getting different results.

282
00:15:43,511 --> 00:15:44,055
Why?

283
00:15:44,055 --> 00:15:51,675
Because sometimes, say for example, if
model is trained for the data until 2023,

284
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:54,965
Then 2024 details model will never fetch.

285
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:58,135
In that case for getting
the latest result, we might

286
00:15:58,265 --> 00:15:59,725
rely on the other sources.

287
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,205
So accuracy need to be validated.

288
00:16:02,465 --> 00:16:06,095
We need to know about the model, how
they are trained on what set of data

289
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:11,285
they are trained, but still we have all
these apart from this, all these pros and

290
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,735
cons, we can use this as a, guideline.

291
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,630
Even though the accuracy, we need
to validate coherence, relevance,

292
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:22,100
everything we need to validate and we
need to do the , we need to test the

293
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,270
same, prompt, the different versions
and validate and compare the output

294
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,270
because, the MA model should be able
to provide the, same relevant answer

295
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:35,690
if you are asking the same prompt with
different, wordings or different versions.

296
00:16:35,706 --> 00:16:43,795
We can try adjusting the phrases
context and examples based on the

297
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:48,255
feedback so that and finally we can
get the, refined model performance.

298
00:16:48,755 --> 00:16:51,025
coming to conclusion and best practices.

299
00:16:51,505 --> 00:16:56,555
Prompt engineering is essential for
maximizing AI model performance.

300
00:16:56,945 --> 00:17:02,285
Prompt engineering is one of the future
items which all technology people and

301
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,235
every common man will be looking into.

302
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:10,385
Specificity, context, And clear
instructions will drive better

303
00:17:10,385 --> 00:17:12,145
results from an AI model.

304
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:16,725
Experimentation and iteration
are key to optimize the outputs.

305
00:17:17,005 --> 00:17:21,035
Of course, we need to try multiple prompts
instead of relying on the single response.

306
00:17:21,585 --> 00:17:23,435
We have to provide more
and more experiments.

307
00:17:23,595 --> 00:17:28,415
examples and context on what we are
thinking in my mind because the magic

308
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:32,265
behind here is they will understand,
AI models will understand the context

309
00:17:32,265 --> 00:17:33,905
and examples whatever we are setting.

310
00:17:34,645 --> 00:17:38,475
Continuous evaluation and refining
the prompts is required for

311
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,065
more and more accurate results.

312
00:17:40,445 --> 00:17:42,515
So this is coming to a conclusion.

313
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,529
And what are the best practices
required to, have an advanced prompting

314
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:49,557
to get a, best AI performance.

315
00:17:49,877 --> 00:17:53,233
So happy prompting, get the
response effectively, keep looking

316
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:57,337
into, but kindly reach out to me
for any further clarifications.

317
00:17:57,767 --> 00:17:58,177
Thank you.

318
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,797
Thank you for, today's session.
