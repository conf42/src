00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:00,790
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,090
thanks for joining the
Python 2025 conference call.

3
00:00:04,579 --> 00:00:10,530
So today I'll be talking about designing
a robust architecture for seamless

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,550
and efficient migration from on
premise infrastructure to Azure Cloud.

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:22,810
So in this presentation we will delve
Into the best practices for creating an

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,659
efficient architecture that facilitates
Seamless migration from on premise to

7
00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:33,329
club the talk covers everything from
planning automation to leveraging azure

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,105
services for scalability and cost savings.

9
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:40,355
You will live with practical
tips to guide your cloud journey.

10
00:00:41,055 --> 00:00:45,194
let me, go for an introduction
to cloud migration and Azure.

11
00:00:45,615 --> 00:00:48,154
overview of Cloud Adoption Azure role.

12
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:50,035
let's start with an,
overview of Cloud Adoption.

13
00:00:50,045 --> 00:00:52,325
Why it has become essential
for modern businesses?

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,720
Cloud migration refers to the
process of moving data application

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,240
and other business elements from on
premise infrastructure to the cloud.

16
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:08,950
So Azure as a cloud platform plays a
pivotal role in this transformation.

17
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,760
Its flexibility, scalability, and
security capabilities make it a preferred

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,170
choice for enterprise across industries.

19
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,720
So by adopting Azure,
organizations can access.

20
00:01:22,385 --> 00:01:26,925
A wide range of services that
ensures their, operations remain

21
00:01:26,995 --> 00:01:29,225
agile, cost effective, and secure.

22
00:01:29,935 --> 00:01:32,075
So benefit of migrating to Azure.

23
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:36,135
So migration, migrating to
Azure offers numerous benefits.

24
00:01:36,585 --> 00:01:41,944
First, scalability, which provides like a
virtually unlimited computing resources,

25
00:01:42,315 --> 00:01:46,795
allowing businesses to grow without
worrying about infrastructure cost.

26
00:01:47,295 --> 00:01:50,415
It also enhances flexibility by
enabling companies to shift from

27
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:55,060
Capital expenses to operational cost
security is another strong point.

28
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,420
Azure is equipped with advanced
security measures, ensuring that

29
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,890
your data is always protected.

30
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:06,199
Additionally, Azure global presence
enables high availability and disaster

31
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:08,649
recovery across different regions.

32
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,429
Azure services over for overview of
cloud migration is like Azure provides

33
00:02:13,429 --> 00:02:18,359
a comprehensive suite of services
designed to facilitate cloud migration.

34
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:23,949
Key services like Azure Assist with
planning and executing the migration.

35
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:30,199
Is your site recovery ensures business
continuity, while tools like a zoo storage

36
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:35,239
and networking help optimize performance
and connectivity, whether it's for virtual

37
00:02:35,249 --> 00:02:38,059
missions, database or entire workloads.

38
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:43,149
I should has dedicated services for
every aspect of migration journey.

39
00:02:43,649 --> 00:02:45,519
Let's jump to next slide.

40
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,049
So here we will talk about pre
migration consideration as a

41
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:54,179
saying like existing on premise
infrastructure for Azure readiness.

42
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:58,709
So before embarking on migration,
it is crucial to assess.

43
00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:01,299
how do you optimize your
critical infrastructure?

44
00:03:01,309 --> 00:03:06,229
This includes understanding the
state of your hardware, software,

45
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:10,029
network, setup, and the application.

46
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,159
Are they optimized for cloud migration?

47
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:17,759
Conducting a thorough assessment helps
identifying potential roadblocks, such

48
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:23,929
as outdated systems or applications
that may require re platforming or re

49
00:03:23,929 --> 00:03:25,699
architecting your cloud compatibility.

50
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,839
setting clear migration objectives.

51
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:31,039
Defining clear objectives is
essential to successful migration.

52
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:35,999
Do you want to reduce cost or
enhance performance, improve

53
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:37,669
scalability or reliability?

54
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:43,104
Whatever your goals are, it's important
to align them with your business needs.

55
00:03:43,654 --> 00:03:47,824
For example, if your goal is to disaster
recovery, you might prioritize Azure

56
00:03:47,824 --> 00:03:51,914
Site Recovery feature to ensure minimal
downtime during the migration process.

57
00:03:52,694 --> 00:03:55,434
key factors for workload, SAP
workload migrations are like

58
00:03:56,364 --> 00:04:02,054
migrating SAP workloads, particularly
systems like SAP HANA or S4 HANA

59
00:04:02,424 --> 00:04:04,224
requires special considerations.

60
00:04:04,854 --> 00:04:08,004
SAP HANA are often highly complex
and ensuring that they run

61
00:04:08,004 --> 00:04:12,539
smoothly on Azure requires in depth
understanding of Azure capabilities.

62
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:17,079
So factors like HA, High Availability,
Performance Optimization, and

63
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:22,149
Storage Management are essential when
migrating SAP workloads to clouds.

64
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:24,929
Let's dive into next session.

65
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:26,309
next slide.

66
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,139
So core principles of cloud architecture.

67
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:30,239
We will talk about that.

68
00:04:30,309 --> 00:04:35,564
when designing a cloud architecture, key
principles includes Scalability, security,

69
00:04:35,864 --> 00:04:38,344
resilience, and cost optimization.

70
00:04:38,354 --> 00:04:40,284
These four are the main key principles.

71
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:44,144
Scalability ensures that your
architecture can grow your business.

72
00:04:44,894 --> 00:04:49,204
Security is critical, ensuring the
sensitive data is protected both at

73
00:04:49,264 --> 00:04:52,234
rest or in transit and in transit.

74
00:04:52,734 --> 00:04:56,194
Resilience ensures minimal downtime
with automatic failover and

75
00:04:56,204 --> 00:04:57,984
cost option optimization helps

76
00:04:58,484 --> 00:05:02,354
ensure that you don't overspend
on unnecessary resources.

77
00:05:03,154 --> 00:05:08,504
Azure well architecture framework
provides That helps the success

78
00:05:08,504 --> 00:05:09,504
of your cloud architecture.

79
00:05:10,194 --> 00:05:14,494
So this tool, what we have in
Azure, it includes key P five

80
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:19,124
pillars, cost optimization,
operation, excellence, performance,

81
00:05:19,394 --> 00:05:21,704
efficiency, reliable, and security.

82
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:25,814
Each pillar is designed to ensure that
you are building a robust, efficient,

83
00:05:26,404 --> 00:05:29,194
and secure cloud infrastructure.

84
00:05:29,644 --> 00:05:31,654
Ensuring smooth operations
in the long run.

85
00:05:32,154 --> 00:05:35,294
SAP specific cloud architecture
design is somewhat like, it's not

86
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,184
different, but similar to that.

87
00:05:37,664 --> 00:05:40,584
For SAP specific workloads, what we
do is that ensuring high availability

88
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:41,844
is critical first for them.

89
00:05:42,444 --> 00:05:46,264
Azure provides options like AV zones,
that means availability zones, and

90
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:47,844
load balancing to maintain uptime.

91
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:53,514
Additionally, migrating SAP HANA database
requires specialized configurations.

92
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:58,889
Such as high performance storage
options and ensuring data integrity

93
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:00,339
during the migration process.

94
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:03,619
Let's go to next slide here.

95
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:06,189
We'll talk about Azure Migration Approach.

96
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:08,159
So what are the approach we follow?

97
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,709
There are many type of migrations
approach we can follow.

98
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:14,479
So when migrating to Azure,
we follow like lift and shift

99
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:16,609
that is Rehost they call it as.

100
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:18,209
This is the simplest approach.

101
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:22,879
where you move as they are to
Azure with minimal charges to suit

102
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:24,459
different type of work requirements.

103
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,939
Re platforming, that is called,
we call this a repackage.

104
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:31,685
In this approach, you might need
to modify certain components to be

105
00:06:31,685 --> 00:06:37,258
more Azure friendly, but don't make
drastic changes to the architecture.

106
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:42,319
re architecting for Azure Cloud Native
solutions, this is most comprehensive

107
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:47,339
approach, where you redesign your
application to fully leverage Azure

108
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:54,304
Cloud Native services Such as using Azure
Kubernetes service for containerizations,

109
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:56,554
tools and services for migrations.

110
00:06:56,554 --> 00:07:00,814
What we use here when we do the
migration to streamline migration,

111
00:07:01,304 --> 00:07:06,834
we use Azure Migrate is a central
centralized hub to access and also

112
00:07:07,124 --> 00:07:08,774
move your on premise workload to Azure.

113
00:07:09,274 --> 00:07:12,564
And Azure Site Recruit as we have
discussed, as we discussed in our previous

114
00:07:12,564 --> 00:07:17,994
slides where it ensures disaster recovery
and smooth failover during migration.

115
00:07:18,484 --> 00:07:23,444
Azure automation simplifies and
automates repetitive tasks and making

116
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:24,984
the migration process more efficient.

117
00:07:25,574 --> 00:07:28,584
So data migration and synchronization,
let's talk about that, why we need that.

118
00:07:29,044 --> 00:07:32,934
So tools like Azure Database Migration
Service allows you to transfer your

119
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:35,204
database to Azure with minimal downtime.

120
00:07:35,654 --> 00:07:39,359
For larger databases, You can go for
Azure Data Bots, offers a physical

121
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:42,549
appliance for secure fast data transfers.

122
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:47,689
Azure Data Factory is one more
tool which helps synchronization,

123
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:52,689
synchronize data across environments,
ensuring that data is consistent and

124
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:56,299
available during the migration process.

125
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:59,269
Let's get on to another slide.

126
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:00,989
Next slide is this is the also.

127
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:04,429
Post migration optimization
management will talk about here.

128
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:07,949
So SAP post migration
optimization, what does it mean?

129
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:12,549
So once the whole migration
is complete, optimizing SAP

130
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:14,799
workloads on Azure is crucial.

131
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:16,459
So this includes.

132
00:08:17,084 --> 00:08:22,854
Performance tuning to ensure that SAP
application runs smoothly as well as

133
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:27,944
storage optimization for SAP HANA,
which can be resource intensive.

134
00:08:28,444 --> 00:08:34,094
Azure provides various tools to help
monitor and fine tune these workloads.

135
00:08:34,594 --> 00:08:37,324
And let's talk about a continuous
monitoring and maintenance.

136
00:08:37,824 --> 00:08:41,734
So Azure, we have a lot of tools like
Azure Monitor, Azure Automation and

137
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:45,434
Azure Center, Security Center helps in
countries monitoring and how does like

138
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:49,154
so with this comprehensive monitoring
tools like Azure Monitor where you can

139
00:08:49,214 --> 00:08:53,694
monitor real time insights into your
workloads and then Azure Automation

140
00:08:53,934 --> 00:09:00,554
helps maintain consistency across
environments while Azure Security

141
00:09:00,554 --> 00:09:05,484
Center ensures your system remains That
is the main important, tool we have.

142
00:09:06,184 --> 00:09:11,334
Regular maintenance is vital to avoid
issues and optimize performance.

143
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:15,884
Let's talk about ongoing backup and
disaster recovery, which is a critical

144
00:09:15,924 --> 00:09:20,424
part after post migration of SAP systems
or any application you take it up.

145
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:26,744
So even post migration, backup and
disaster recovery are essential.

146
00:09:27,244 --> 00:09:32,514
Azure Backup ensures your critical
workloads are safe and While high

147
00:09:32,514 --> 00:09:38,284
availability and disaster recovery plans
ensures that your application can quickly

148
00:09:38,284 --> 00:09:40,504
recover in case of any system failure.

149
00:09:41,004 --> 00:09:42,774
Let's dive to next session.

150
00:09:43,114 --> 00:09:48,124
Let's talk about leveraging
automation for migration.

151
00:09:49,054 --> 00:09:52,044
So automation is a key
part of cloud migration.

152
00:09:52,544 --> 00:09:58,014
So here, why I said automation is a
key part of learning because Automation

153
00:09:58,194 --> 00:10:02,214
Azure Automate helps streamline the
migration process by automating tasks

154
00:10:02,214 --> 00:10:05,584
like deployment and patch management.

155
00:10:06,084 --> 00:10:11,974
Azure DevOps allows you to done
define, sorry, infrastructure

156
00:10:11,974 --> 00:10:18,584
as a core, enabling repeatable
deployment and ensuring continuous

157
00:10:18,644 --> 00:10:20,294
across environment environments.

158
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:23,394
Azure Logic apps can automate workflows.

159
00:10:23,894 --> 00:10:27,074
And integrate various systems
without manual intervention.

160
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,194
That is the best part here
we have in automation.

161
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:32,944
So we do have Cloud Adoption
Framework for migration.

162
00:10:33,414 --> 00:10:36,744
When we do migration, the Cloud
Adoption Framework, what we have is

163
00:10:36,784 --> 00:10:40,984
helps guides your migrations, SAP
migration through several phases.

164
00:10:41,484 --> 00:10:42,214
How does it guide?

165
00:10:42,764 --> 00:10:44,223
Like strategy phase.

166
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,194
We're aligning cloud adoption
codes with our overall business

167
00:10:48,204 --> 00:10:50,574
strategies and planning phase.

168
00:10:51,194 --> 00:10:56,444
This phase conducts readiness assessments
to ensure that your infrastructure and

169
00:10:56,444 --> 00:10:59,214
the processes are prepared for migration.

170
00:10:59,714 --> 00:11:04,834
And ready phase is there, setting up
governance models and security framework

171
00:11:04,884 --> 00:11:08,004
to ensure compliance during migration.

172
00:11:08,504 --> 00:11:11,924
Adopt phase, this is the phase
where, executing the migration plan.

173
00:11:12,364 --> 00:11:16,924
While ensuring minimal disruption
to ongoing business process,

174
00:11:17,424 --> 00:11:20,224
governance phase they will say
that ongoing compliance, cost

175
00:11:20,224 --> 00:11:22,224
optimization and operation governance.

176
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:28,194
Manage phase here we do continuous
monitoring optimization and

177
00:11:28,344 --> 00:11:30,064
scaling post migrations.

178
00:11:30,584 --> 00:11:34,424
So these are all like, part of like
cloud adoption framework phases,

179
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:39,844
which we follow to ensure that smooth
migration of your, landscape to cloud.

180
00:11:40,344 --> 00:11:42,764
Let's get into the next
slide where we'll talk about

181
00:11:42,854 --> 00:11:45,704
Conclusion and future directions.

182
00:11:45,754 --> 00:11:49,814
So we'll talk about something like,
so whatever we have learned cloud

183
00:11:49,814 --> 00:11:53,284
journey migration journey so far,
we'll make it as a wrapping up.

184
00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:57,494
So here, cloud migration is a
complex but rewarding journey

185
00:11:58,064 --> 00:12:03,534
that involves careful planning,
execution, and ongoing optimization.

186
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:08,279
Once you have successfully
migrated, you will see significant

187
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:13,229
improvement in scalability, cost,
efficiency, and performance.

188
00:12:13,729 --> 00:12:17,379
The future of cloud and SAP
in digital transformation era.

189
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:18,989
How does it look?

190
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,349
As a digital transformation
accelerates, the future of

191
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:24,699
cloud and SAP is intertwined.

192
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:32,219
With emerging technologies like AI,
machine learning, and IOT, SAP's role in

193
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:37,509
the cloud continues to grow and companies
are leveraging these capabilities

194
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:43,689
to drive innovation and business
Innovations in cloud migration, AI, ML,

195
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,359
and edge computing are part of this.

196
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:49,579
Technologies like AI, ML, edge
computing are revolutionizing

197
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:53,679
the cloud migration process.

198
00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:59,019
These innovations help automate tasks,
predict issues before they occur.

199
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,579
And optimize workloads in real time,
making cloud adoptions even more seamless.

200
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:09,198
The earlier we talked about
about HA, high availability.

201
00:13:09,578 --> 00:13:13,678
So to failover from Azure side,
we have different tools like,

202
00:13:13,688 --> 00:13:15,928
AV zones with the SLAs of 99.

203
00:13:15,968 --> 00:13:18,278
99%, AV set with 99.

204
00:13:18,448 --> 00:13:21,428
95%. So those are the
SLAs for, from Azure side.

205
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:28,538
Whereas from SAP side, for HA, we have
clustering tools, like Pacemaker, SIOS

206
00:13:28,548 --> 00:13:34,938
Cluster tool, and Veritas InfoScale tool
is also available, where we can make

207
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:39,018
the failover, automation of failover,
in case of any disruption to the primary

208
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:45,738
region or primary system, primary HANA
database, or SAP EACS server or SAP

209
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:47,898
Enquiry Application Server will be there.

210
00:13:48,403 --> 00:13:51,253
So with those tools, we'll do the
failover, automation of failover.

211
00:13:51,703 --> 00:13:55,503
So at any point of time, the
user will not see any disruptions

212
00:13:55,963 --> 00:13:57,983
during their working session.

213
00:13:58,483 --> 00:14:02,113
So let's talk about my last point,
like emerging trends in SAP and

214
00:14:02,123 --> 00:14:03,293
cloud, how that future will be.

215
00:14:03,663 --> 00:14:07,713
The future of SAP in the cloud is
increasing, increasingly cloud native.

216
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:14,333
As SAP continues to evolve and
organizations are adopting cloud

217
00:14:14,343 --> 00:14:18,713
native solutions, leveraging
microservices and containerization.

218
00:14:19,213 --> 00:14:23,213
To create more flexible and
scalable architecture on Azure.

219
00:14:23,713 --> 00:14:24,913
That's how I conclude.

220
00:14:25,343 --> 00:14:26,323
I work for Microsoft.

221
00:14:27,253 --> 00:14:27,813
Thank you all.

222
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:29,963
Thanks for listening to my session.

223
00:14:30,823 --> 00:14:31,523
Thank you all once again.

224
00:14:31,593 --> 00:14:31,843
Bye.

225
00:14:32,053 --> 00:14:32,393
Take care.
