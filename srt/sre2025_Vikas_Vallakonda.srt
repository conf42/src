In this, video.

14
00:00:49,365 --> 00:00:53,725
I'm going to explain more about the
ai, how it is impacting the revenue

15
00:00:53,725 --> 00:00:58,985
management how we can leverage predict
analytics and AI for revenue optimization.

16
00:00:59,445 --> 00:01:00,435
In enterprise level.

17
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:05,295
Currently in the present world we could
see that a lot of things we can optimize

18
00:01:05,295 --> 00:01:10,365
using ai in this, in this video we'll
examine how the real world results

19
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:13,935
and the infrastructure requirements
and ethical considerations are helping

20
00:01:14,395 --> 00:01:18,605
different organizations how AI integration
can position your organization.

21
00:01:19,425 --> 00:01:25,305
This presentation explores more on AI
technologies enabling gains in forecasting

22
00:01:25,305 --> 00:01:30,075
accuracy, price optimization, customer
intelligence, and retention strategies.

23
00:01:31,065 --> 00:01:34,235
First, I would like to talk
about the AI revolution in the

24
00:01:34,235 --> 00:01:36,125
enterprise revenue management area.

25
00:01:36,735 --> 00:01:42,875
I would like to talk how this AI is
helping to shift from traditional

26
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:46,350
business to to the AI cloud area.

27
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,820
By building in inte systems from
ground up companies are creating

28
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,470
self optimization revenue engines.

29
00:01:51,965 --> 00:01:55,895
That continually, continuously adapting
the market conditions, operation

30
00:01:55,895 --> 00:01:57,785
constraints, and customer behaviors.

31
00:01:58,605 --> 00:02:04,135
There's a lot of sustainable financial
environments using ai, how AI can data

32
00:02:04,135 --> 00:02:08,985
can help you for building your new
strategies and building your business

33
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:11,835
complex solutions based on the data.

34
00:02:12,335 --> 00:02:15,615
Next, I would like to give you
some forecasting the demand,

35
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:19,635
how AI is helping for building
revenue for the organizations.

36
00:02:20,175 --> 00:02:24,255
There's a 45% reduction cost
in forecasting error when

37
00:02:24,255 --> 00:02:26,385
doing this AI power tools.

38
00:02:27,165 --> 00:02:31,305
There's a 92% accuracy on the data.

39
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:34,245
How can the strategies can
be built for organizations.

40
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:39,765
And there is a 30% I rate
turnover increase using this ai.

41
00:02:40,265 --> 00:02:43,315
And this is directly impacting the
bottom line through improved cash

42
00:02:43,315 --> 00:02:45,645
flow and reduced carrying costs.

43
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:50,675
Pricing is helping organizations
to leverage the market conditions

44
00:02:51,165 --> 00:02:54,835
inventory levels and customer behaves
retailers that are implementing

45
00:02:54,835 --> 00:02:56,455
this AI driven pricing report.

46
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:02,330
Improvements, eight to 12% on average
with an increase of up to 16% during

47
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,640
the peak seasons of the market.

48
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,540
Next, I would like to talk about the
lead identification and how can you

49
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:16,700
convert conversion automations, how AI is
helping to pick the leads and implement

50
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,890
their, convert their leads to business.

51
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,440
By focusing resources on high potential
leads, organs are achieving convers

52
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,200
30% higher conversion rate rates.

53
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,380
Using this ai these systems continuously
learns from successful conversions,

54
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,820
becoming increasing accuracy day
by day, and adapting to evolve

55
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,320
based on the customer behaviors.

56
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,649
And we have the next thing
is about the data collection,

57
00:03:43,649 --> 00:03:45,209
how the AI is analyzing it.

58
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:49,284
How these how the recommendations
are made by the ai based on the data

59
00:03:49,284 --> 00:03:53,485
of the customers and the consumers,
and how is it impacting the revenue?

60
00:03:54,245 --> 00:03:58,195
It is impacting almost a three, 300%
increase in the revenue using all these

61
00:03:58,195 --> 00:04:03,394
tools by AI and by delivering relevant
experience at precisely the right moment.

62
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:07,204
These systems create stronger customer
relationships while simultaneously

63
00:04:07,235 --> 00:04:10,894
maximizing the revenue opportunities,
which is a big thing for our organization.

64
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:16,309
These sophisticated systems
content recommendations, and I

65
00:04:17,179 --> 00:04:23,030
interfaces to match each customer's
unique interests and needs.

66
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,830
And the next, I would like
to talk about the customer

67
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,330
retention and joint pretension.

68
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:32,370
How how we are identifying the
risks based on the behavior

69
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,500
of the customer using the ai.

70
00:04:35,355 --> 00:04:40,665
Risk identification, we can reduce
the risk to 35% using this ai, and the

71
00:04:40,665 --> 00:04:46,425
return of investment is increasing up
to two 70% using these technologies.

72
00:04:46,925 --> 00:04:51,375
Next I would like to talk about the
best best action intelligence, which

73
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,515
is called NBI Next best action.

74
00:04:55,085 --> 00:05:00,575
Using this data, the AI engine has
thousands of potential next steps and

75
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:05,405
selects the optimal action for each
individual customer balancing revenue

76
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,995
opportunities with long-term relationship.

77
00:05:07,815 --> 00:05:12,225
It also, it is a proven that like 20%
higher customer satisfaction and 28%

78
00:05:12,225 --> 00:05:15,085
improvement in sales with these AI tools.

79
00:05:15,585 --> 00:05:18,555
Next how the enterprise data
infrastructure is helping.

80
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:24,050
Is getting evolved using this ai when
you use these robust infrastructures,

81
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:28,270
which is which is a forms of
foundation for the AI driven revenue

82
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,760
optimizations, architecture involved.

83
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:36,439
It is high standards and it is highly
complaints and is very much real time.

84
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:41,039
Enterprise grades implementations
process a maximum of nine to

85
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,629
10 million records per hour.

86
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:46,529
Which are, which have a
response of 95% transactions.

87
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:50,069
This performance is essentially for
types and applications like dynamic

88
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:55,269
pricing and personalization, which in
which helps the organization to improve

89
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:57,129
their revenues, revenue opportunities.

90
00:05:57,309 --> 00:06:00,924
So you have everything real
time with using this AI driven

91
00:06:00,974 --> 00:06:02,814
tools and infrastructure.

92
00:06:02,874 --> 00:06:08,024
And it process a high volume in less time,
which is a big thing for an organization.

93
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:13,040
To build their strategies and the made
up like how you can ethically do your

94
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,350
business, like fairness, privacy, and
data security and talent transparency

95
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:22,440
while making decision making with
the stakeholders the future of ai.

96
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,270
It gonna impact, it, gonna do a lot
of things in the in building a revenue

97
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,150
and, it'll do a lot of changes to the
integrated core AI revenue systems.

98
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,830
Establishing robot frameworks for
using, for ensuring AI systems operating

99
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,290
fairly transparently in compliance
with the regulatory and how these AI

100
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:45,530
applications will help you scale and
optimize continuously and it'll help you

101
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,040
to develop the unified data architecture.

102
00:06:49,585 --> 00:06:53,925
Which can help you to improve your
systems customer satisfaction and revenue.

103
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:55,365
Thank you.

104
00:06:55,825 --> 00:06:57,325
Thanks for giving me this opportunity.

105
00:06:57,354 --> 00:06:58,765
Looking forward for the confidence.

106
00:06:59,215 --> 00:06:59,664
Have a nice day.
