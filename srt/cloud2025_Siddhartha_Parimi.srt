00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,019
Hey everyone, welcome to today's
session from chaos to clarity

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,730
data lakehouse architectures.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,530
So before we dive in, let me ask how
many of you have worked with data lakes

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:16,149
or data warehouses and how many of you
have faced challenges with scalability,

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,770
cost, governance or analytic performance.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,340
So you're not alone.

7
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:24,439
enterprises are generating
more data than ever before.

8
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:28,519
So think about this every day
companies produce petabytes of

9
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:34,530
data from customer transactions to
mission logs by 2025 Global data is

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,180
expected to exceed 180 zettabytes.

11
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,680
That's more than double today's
volume So what's the problem here?

12
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:47,135
The traditional systems just can't
handle this explosion efficiently So

13
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:49,435
how do we turn this chaos into clarity?

14
00:00:50,255 --> 00:00:54,335
That's where the data lakehouse
architecture comes in, which combines the

15
00:00:54,344 --> 00:00:59,175
best of data lakes and data warehouses
into a single scalable platform.

16
00:00:59,795 --> 00:01:03,795
So in this session, I will walk
you through why traditional systems

17
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:08,115
struggle, how lakehouses solve
this issue, and what makes them the

18
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:10,175
future of enterprise data management.

19
00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:11,535
So let's get started.

20
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:16,974
So imagine a large retailer processing
millions of sales transactions daily.

21
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:21,865
So their data includes structured
purchase records, semi structured weblogs,

22
00:01:22,095 --> 00:01:23,845
and unstructured customer reviews.

23
00:01:24,244 --> 00:01:28,335
If they use a traditional warehouse,
they must constantly restructure

24
00:01:28,335 --> 00:01:33,564
data before analysis, which might
delay insights and increasing costs.

25
00:01:34,154 --> 00:01:38,865
So in the similar way, billions of
online transactions, supply chain

26
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:43,175
updates across global warehouses,
customer behavior data from clicks

27
00:01:43,175 --> 00:01:47,725
and purchases, unstructured data from
chatbots, emails, and customer support.

28
00:01:48,265 --> 00:01:52,104
So all this adds up to petabytes
of data every single day.

29
00:01:52,304 --> 00:01:53,085
And guess what?

30
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:54,365
It's only increasing.

31
00:01:54,785 --> 00:01:58,604
So data is expected to
grow 2x every two years.

32
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,674
So what challenges we are
running into this, right?

33
00:02:01,694 --> 00:02:03,834
The number one is the scalability issues.

34
00:02:04,274 --> 00:02:08,195
Most legacy systems just aren't
built for today's data explosion.

35
00:02:08,514 --> 00:02:12,274
As data grows exponentially,
traditional databases slow down.

36
00:02:12,785 --> 00:02:16,485
Struggle with query performance
and become expensive to maintain.

37
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,700
And the second challenge
is the structure problems.

38
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,649
Data lakes are meant to store raw data,
but without proper governance, they turn

39
00:02:24,649 --> 00:02:29,010
into data swamps, which are unmanageable,
disorganized, and hard to query.

40
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:31,519
And the third challenge is the analytics.

41
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,990
So traditional data warehouses
require expensive infrastructure and

42
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,990
rigid schemas, making it difficult
to adapt to new business needs.

43
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:44,669
They are great for structured
data, but struggle with semi

44
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:46,459
structured and unstructured formats.

45
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,739
So at the end, like business needs a
system that is scalable, flexible, cost

46
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:54,429
effective and optimized for analytics.

47
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:57,609
That's where the data lake house come in.

48
00:02:58,109 --> 00:02:59,859
So what is data lake house?

49
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:04,389
It's a modern data architecture
that combines the strength of both

50
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:06,689
data lakes and data warehouses.

51
00:03:07,089 --> 00:03:11,570
So let's take a closer look at the
components that make lake houses work.

52
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:13,409
The first is the storage layer.

53
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:18,069
Optimized with open formats like
Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake

54
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,969
for scalability and efficiency.

55
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,259
Secondly, the metadata layer.

56
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:26,779
Ensures schema evolution, indexing,
and cataloging, making data

57
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,669
easier to discover and query.

58
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:30,879
Third, the processing layer.

59
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:36,229
Uses Apache Spark and SQL engines to
enable real time and batch processing.

60
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,789
And lastly, the governance and security.

61
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:43,479
Supports role based access, encryption,
and audit logging for compliance.

62
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:49,364
So by integrating all these layers, lake
houses solve the problems of both lakes

63
00:03:49,415 --> 00:03:55,204
and warehouses, making data management
faster, smarter, and more cost efficient.

64
00:03:55,704 --> 00:03:59,154
So what do we give the strengths of
both data lake and warehouses, right?

65
00:03:59,154 --> 00:04:03,384
From data lakes, you get the
scalability, cost efficiency, and

66
00:04:03,384 --> 00:04:05,134
support of all data types, right?

67
00:04:05,154 --> 00:04:07,874
Like the structured, semi
structured, and unstructured.

68
00:04:08,504 --> 00:04:12,844
From data warehouses, you get
performance, asset compliance, schema

69
00:04:12,844 --> 00:04:15,234
enforcement, and optimized querying.

70
00:04:15,914 --> 00:04:19,864
Think of a lake house like
a well organized library.

71
00:04:20,044 --> 00:04:23,934
A traditional data lake is like
a warehouse full of random books,

72
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:26,225
messy and hard to find anything.

73
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:31,385
A data warehouse is like a neatly
organized section, but limited

74
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:33,834
in space and expense to maintain.

75
00:04:34,444 --> 00:04:38,204
So a lake house, it's the best
of both worlds, organized,

76
00:04:38,234 --> 00:04:39,405
scalable, and efficient.

77
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,284
So why does this matter?

78
00:04:41,335 --> 00:04:45,504
Enterprises can scale from terabytes to
exabytes while maintaining performance,

79
00:04:45,844 --> 00:04:50,314
unified storage and compute layers,
eliminate unnecessary data duplication.

80
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:55,314
So support for AML workloads without
additional data transformations.

81
00:04:55,814 --> 00:04:57,294
So cost is a big deal.

82
00:04:57,374 --> 00:05:01,295
When managing enterprise data, lake
houses help organizations reduce

83
00:05:01,295 --> 00:05:04,944
storage and compute costs by up to 30%.

84
00:05:05,504 --> 00:05:10,264
But how right scalability like scale
from terabytes to exabytes without

85
00:05:10,304 --> 00:05:14,904
losing performance essential for aml
and real time analytics Second the

86
00:05:14,904 --> 00:05:19,874
optimization 30 cost savings through
smart data management techniques reducing

87
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:24,944
unnecessary data movements And thirdly
governance maintain data quality and

88
00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:29,429
compliance while keeping costs low
Data remains structured and accessible.

89
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:34,369
So the scalability, efficiency, and
governance, three pillars that make

90
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:39,889
lake houses, the go to choice for
modern enterprises, for instance, a

91
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:44,809
financial service company saved millions
annually by replacing their costly

92
00:05:44,809 --> 00:05:46,619
traditional warehouse with a lake house.

93
00:05:47,164 --> 00:05:52,264
Reducing redundant storage and processing
costs by optimizing tied storage.

94
00:05:52,764 --> 00:05:57,394
So a major concern with data lakes is
that they lack ACID transactions, which

95
00:05:57,394 --> 00:05:59,824
means data consistency isn't guaranteed.

96
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:04,194
So which the lake houses
will solve this issue, right?

97
00:06:04,494 --> 00:06:08,544
With Atomosity, ensures transactions
are all or nothing, preventing

98
00:06:08,544 --> 00:06:10,594
partial updates that can corrupt data.

99
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:15,314
Consistency, data remains in a valid
state before and after updates.

100
00:06:15,924 --> 00:06:19,734
Isolation, concurrent
transactions don't interfere,

101
00:06:19,924 --> 00:06:22,004
maintaining accuracy, durability.

102
00:06:22,404 --> 00:06:26,454
Once committed, data stays permanent,
even if the system crashes.

103
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:30,194
so why does this matter,
for enterprises, right?

104
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:35,454
Enterprises can ensure data reliability
even at scale, like supports critical

105
00:06:35,454 --> 00:06:39,084
applications like fraud detection
and real time financial transactions.

106
00:06:40,044 --> 00:06:44,804
Now, for an example, think about
an e commerce company processing

107
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:46,244
thousands of orders per second.

108
00:06:46,794 --> 00:06:50,864
Asset Compliance ensures that
even in case of a failure, orders

109
00:06:50,864 --> 00:06:52,394
are never lost or duplicated.

110
00:06:52,894 --> 00:06:56,174
Data is constantly evolving,
new sources, new business

111
00:06:56,174 --> 00:06:58,174
requirements, new regulatory needs.

112
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:01,644
Traditional warehouses struggle
with schema changes, but

113
00:07:01,664 --> 00:07:03,874
Lakehouses handle them seamlessly.

114
00:07:04,374 --> 00:07:09,104
Firstly, we plan, assess current schema
needs and anticipate future changes.

115
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,719
Second, implement.

116
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:13,439
Deploy schema updates without downtime.

117
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:15,189
Third, validate.

118
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,169
Ensure data consistency
and query compatibility.

119
00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:19,919
Fourth, monitor.

120
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:22,379
Track performance and adapt dynamically.

121
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:27,659
this flexibility allows organizations
to integrate new data sources

122
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,129
without disrupting workflows.

123
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:31,839
Moving to the next slide.

124
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:34,769
Lakehouses aren't just
about storage, right?

125
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:37,919
they enable real time
analytics using Apache Spark.

126
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:42,604
For instance, with the speed, process
petabytes of data with sub second

127
00:07:42,604 --> 00:07:44,934
latency for real time decisions.

128
00:07:45,204 --> 00:07:46,534
Secondly, flexibility.

129
00:07:46,994 --> 00:07:50,984
Runs both BI dashboards and ML
models on the same infrastructure.

130
00:07:51,454 --> 00:07:52,524
Unified platform.

131
00:07:52,634 --> 00:07:56,754
Handles streaming, batch processing,
and interactive queries efficiently.

132
00:07:57,664 --> 00:08:01,439
So whether it's fraud detection,
recommendation engines, or supply

133
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,034
chain optimization, Lakehouse
delivers insight in real time.

134
00:08:05,534 --> 00:08:10,394
For example, a ride sharing company
uses lake houses to analyze driver

135
00:08:10,394 --> 00:08:15,314
locations, ride requests, and pricing
data in real time, ensuring dynamic

136
00:08:15,314 --> 00:08:17,164
fare adjustments within seconds.

137
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:21,034
So traditional ETL process
is expensive and slow.

138
00:08:21,304 --> 00:08:24,914
Lakehouse has solved this by
enabling in place data processing.

139
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:28,664
First, with the ingest,
direct ingestion from multiple

140
00:08:28,664 --> 00:08:30,204
sources without pre processing.

141
00:08:30,614 --> 00:08:35,224
Data transformations happen directly
within the Lakehouse using SQL and Python.

142
00:08:35,844 --> 00:08:40,134
Third, with the low immediate
data availability for analytics.

143
00:08:40,134 --> 00:08:44,344
So this reduces infrastructure
costs, eliminates unnecessary data

144
00:08:44,344 --> 00:08:46,924
movement, and accelerates insights.

145
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:52,304
As an example, a healthcare company
reduced patient data processing time from

146
00:08:52,344 --> 00:08:58,264
24 hours to just 30 minutes by eliminating
redundant ETL steps in their lake house.

147
00:08:58,764 --> 00:09:01,904
So in most enterprises,
data is locked in silos.

148
00:09:02,224 --> 00:09:05,404
Different departments struggle
to access relevant information.

149
00:09:05,894 --> 00:09:09,244
Lake houses solve this by
creating a single source of truth.

150
00:09:10,054 --> 00:09:14,344
By, with secure role based
access to all data sources.

151
00:09:14,844 --> 00:09:18,534
Powerful search and metadata tools
to find the right data instantly.

152
00:09:19,194 --> 00:09:21,604
Seamless collaboration across departments.

153
00:09:21,924 --> 00:09:27,084
So by democratizing access, businesses
boost efficiency and innovation.

154
00:09:27,584 --> 00:09:32,254
So at the end of the day, data is only
as valuable as the insights it delivers.

155
00:09:32,524 --> 00:09:37,234
So with the Lakehouse infrastructure
and architecture, 30 percent cost

156
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:40,404
reduction is expected through
optimized storage and processing.

157
00:09:40,774 --> 00:09:45,014
And 90 percent faster queries, thanks
to the advanced indexing and caching.

158
00:09:45,514 --> 00:09:49,754
So from predictive analytics to AI
driven insights, lakehouses help

159
00:09:49,774 --> 00:09:52,944
business make smarter, faster decisions.

160
00:09:53,444 --> 00:09:55,414
All right, so let's recap.

161
00:09:55,604 --> 00:09:58,034
Here's why lakehouses are game changers.

162
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:03,094
Lakehouses scale from terabytes to
exabytes while keeping performance high.

163
00:10:03,554 --> 00:10:07,824
They eliminate ETL inefficiencies
and enable real time analytics.

164
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:12,289
They ensure asset compliance
and strong governance for

165
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:14,289
enterprise grade reliability.

166
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:20,329
So they reduce infrastructure costs by 30
percent while driving AI driven insights.

167
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,639
So they bring governance, compliance,
and security to enterprise data.

168
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:29,429
So in short, lake houses provide
the clarity, efficiency, and

169
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:33,474
innovation Enterprises need to
thrive in data driven world.

170
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:37,074
So the future of data is here
