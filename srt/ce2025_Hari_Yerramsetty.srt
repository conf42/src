1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:00,970
Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:02,660
My name is Hari Aramshetty.

3
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,880
I'm a software engineer at Flexport.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,360
I'm thrilled to hear today as we dive into
mastering cloud cost efficiency, strategic

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,309
optimization for cloud native success.

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,119
In today's session, we'll explore not
only the traditional cost optimization

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,550
methods, but also how to leverage
FinApps principles to drive smarter

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,990
financial management in the cloud.

9
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:27,715
Whether you're a developer, Operations
expert or financial professional.

10
00:00:28,325 --> 00:00:29,985
There's something in here for you.

11
00:00:30,415 --> 00:00:35,035
So let's get started So here's a
quick overview of what we will cover

12
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:40,054
today We'll set a stage by discussing
why cost efficiency is critical

13
00:00:40,154 --> 00:00:41,904
in today's cloud environments.

14
00:00:42,674 --> 00:00:47,104
We'll examine the key pain points
in managing the cloud expenses and

15
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:50,524
how FinOps provides a framework
to address these challenges.

16
00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:54,944
I'll walk you through the actionable
strategies from resource rightsizing

17
00:00:55,084 --> 00:00:58,384
to budget forecasting that will
blend the traditional techniques

18
00:00:58,524 --> 00:01:00,214
with FinOps best practices.

19
00:01:00,784 --> 00:01:05,204
We'll discuss design considerations
that ensure your applications are

20
00:01:05,234 --> 00:01:07,504
both scalable and cost efficient.

21
00:01:07,994 --> 00:01:13,294
I'll share real examples where
FinOps practices led significant

22
00:01:13,294 --> 00:01:15,204
savings and improved governance.

23
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:19,319
We'll conclude with a step by
step roadmap to implement these

24
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:21,149
strategies within your organization.

25
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:24,699
Optimizing cloud costs is more
than just cutting expense.

26
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,079
It's about driving better return on
investment and fueling innovation.

27
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:35,619
When we control our spend effectively,
we free up resources to invest in new

28
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:38,089
technologies and business opportunities.

29
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:44,304
FinOps fosters a culture of collaboration,
Where finance, operations, and engineering

30
00:01:44,464 --> 00:01:49,384
regularly share insights, set joint
cost targets, and adjust resource

31
00:01:49,444 --> 00:01:51,164
allocation strategies in unison.

32
00:01:51,664 --> 00:01:55,264
For example, when unexpected costs
spikes occur, the engineering team

33
00:01:55,274 --> 00:01:58,314
works alongside the finance to
understand and rectify the issue,

34
00:01:58,874 --> 00:02:03,224
while operations implements automated
policies to prevent recurrence.

35
00:02:03,814 --> 00:02:09,844
This unified approach not only streamlines
cost management, but also drives smarter

36
00:02:09,844 --> 00:02:16,074
decision making across the organization,
ensuring that every team, is both informed

37
00:02:16,224 --> 00:02:18,284
and accountable for their cloud spending.

38
00:02:19,094 --> 00:02:24,434
With continuous monitoring and real time
analytics, FinOps enables us to predict

39
00:02:24,484 --> 00:02:26,754
and manage expenses more accurately.

40
00:02:27,594 --> 00:02:32,124
Organizations that master cloud
cost efficiency can reinvest their

41
00:02:32,124 --> 00:02:36,794
savings into growth initiatives
leading to stronger market position.

42
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:42,564
Essentially, by adopting FinOps, you are
not just saving money, you are setting

43
00:02:42,564 --> 00:02:45,154
the stage for sustainable innovation.

44
00:02:45,654 --> 00:02:48,184
Managing cloud costs comes
with a lot of challenges.

45
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:52,264
Cloud providers offer many pricing
choices like pay as you go,

46
00:02:52,504 --> 00:02:54,194
reserved plans, and spot pricing.

47
00:02:54,704 --> 00:02:57,684
which can make it hard to know
exactly what you will pay for.

48
00:02:58,154 --> 00:03:01,494
Each option has its own benefits
and drawbacks, making it a

49
00:03:01,494 --> 00:03:02,814
challenge to pick the best one.

50
00:03:03,334 --> 00:03:07,304
This complexity often means businesses
must keep a close eye on their

51
00:03:07,314 --> 00:03:09,704
usage to avoid unexpected bills.

52
00:03:10,164 --> 00:03:14,284
Often companies buy more computing
power or storage than they really need,

53
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,064
which means money on unused resources.

54
00:03:17,444 --> 00:03:20,564
On the flip side, if they don't
use the resources they have,

55
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:22,604
It's actually wasting money.

56
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:26,644
This balance is key to managing
the cloud cost efficiently.

57
00:03:27,134 --> 00:03:31,324
Without proper process in place,
each team might set up its own cloud

58
00:03:31,324 --> 00:03:33,404
resources without talking to others.

59
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:38,044
This can lead to a lot of duplicated
work, wasted money and missed chances

60
00:03:38,114 --> 00:03:40,464
to share and optimize resources.

61
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:44,544
In short, a lack of
coordination often results in

62
00:03:44,564 --> 00:03:46,424
inefficiencies across a company.

63
00:03:46,924 --> 00:03:50,934
Without proper visibility, it's hard to
know exactly where your money is going.

64
00:03:51,744 --> 00:03:53,544
This is where FinOps makes a difference.

65
00:03:53,894 --> 00:03:57,934
It promotes a culture of shared
responsibility, encourages regular

66
00:03:58,044 --> 00:04:01,934
cross functional reviews, ensuring
that every team understands and

67
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:03,804
manages their part of the cloud space.

68
00:04:04,804 --> 00:04:07,914
Next, we will look at strategic
cost optimization framework.

69
00:04:08,464 --> 00:04:12,754
Our framework for cost optimization
is built on four key pillars, each

70
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:14,534
enhanced by FinOps principles.

71
00:04:15,224 --> 00:04:19,689
Start by checking how much you spend on
cloud services, And how you use them.

72
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:24,459
This gives you a clear starting point and
shows where you can make changes right

73
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:30,239
away Using data to help you see spending
patterns and set goals for incremental

74
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:36,069
improvement Start by matching your cloud
resources to your actual needs a practice

75
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:41,799
We call right sizing and consider reserved
capacity for workloads that run steadily

76
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:46,459
You can go for RA shopping with your
cloud account This helps ensure that you

77
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:49,049
aren't paying for more than you need.

78
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:54,909
Also use Phenom's practices to regularly
review your spending and adjust your

79
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:57,919
budget based on how much you actually use.

80
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:04,379
First, set clear policies for
managing cloud costs and use tools

81
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:06,349
to automatically track spending.

82
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,429
Like tagging.

83
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:12,944
These tags help you to see which
engineering organization or

84
00:05:12,974 --> 00:05:15,434
project is using each resource.

85
00:05:16,034 --> 00:05:19,274
Then form teams from different
departments to take shared

86
00:05:19,274 --> 00:05:25,584
responsibility, keep track of spending
and make sure the process is followed.

87
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:30,224
Continually track spending with
dashboards and analytical tools.

88
00:05:30,904 --> 00:05:37,234
Use FinOps reporting to proactively manage
costs and adjust strategies in real time.

89
00:05:38,024 --> 00:05:44,814
This cyclic approach of Optimize, govern
and monitor is critical to achieve

90
00:05:45,084 --> 00:05:47,604
sustainable cost efficiency in the cloud.

91
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:50,859
Next, we will take a look at
cloud native best practices

92
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:53,919
for cost efficiency and finops.

93
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,419
When it comes to cloud native design,
building cost efficiency into your

94
00:05:58,549 --> 00:06:00,289
architecture from the start is the key.

95
00:06:01,109 --> 00:06:01,649
Here's how.

96
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:04,629
Adopt microservices and containerization.

97
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:09,319
These technologies allow you to build
modular, and scalable applications

98
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:11,559
that can dynamically adjust to demand.

99
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:17,049
Using microservices means breaking
your application into smaller

100
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:19,169
independent parts that work together.

101
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:25,379
Each part can be updated or scaled on
its own, making the system more flexible.

102
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:31,289
The containerization packages are
These parts into easy to move units.

103
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:36,069
So your application can quickly
adjust to the changes in demand.

104
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:40,689
Another way we can do this is
leveraging serverless architectures.

105
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,459
Serverless computing means you don't pay
for the running servers all the time.

106
00:06:46,049 --> 00:06:50,949
Instead, you only pay when your code
is running or handling a request.

107
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:55,389
This approach helps you save
money by eliminating costs

108
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:57,549
for unused idle capacity.

109
00:06:58,049 --> 00:07:01,959
Another strategy that we can use
is implementing auto scaling.

110
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,099
This enables your system to automatically
scale resources based on demand, a

111
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:12,349
process that should FinOps metrics.

112
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:18,349
Moreover, Integrating FinOps in your
design process means designing for

113
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:20,529
cost transparency from the start.

114
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:24,809
This means every team member from
the developers to the financial

115
00:07:25,299 --> 00:07:31,909
analysts can see how design decisions
impact the bottom line, try for more

116
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:34,689
informed cost effective decisions.

117
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:39,849
So let's take a look at key cost
optimization and FinOps strategies.

118
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:43,369
Let's dive into some of the
practical strategies that blend it.

119
00:07:43,549 --> 00:07:46,869
Traditional cost optimization
with FinOps best practices.

120
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:48,769
Resource site sizing.

121
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,099
So used detailed usage data for
FinOps dashboards to understand

122
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:55,879
your current resource utilization.

123
00:07:56,829 --> 00:08:04,879
So that CPU or memory for your containers
or EC2 machines and see how much is an

124
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:08,719
ideal time and how much is the usage time.

125
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:13,329
So adjust your resource allocations
dynamically based on real time

126
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:15,229
demand to avoid over provisioning.

127
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:19,129
You can also take a look at
reserved or spot instances

128
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:21,669
based on the workload types.

129
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:23,329
Reserved instances.

130
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:27,199
Reserved instances are ideal for
predictable, steady workloads.

131
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:31,899
They offer a significant cost savings
by committing to a long term usage.

132
00:08:32,689 --> 00:08:37,239
That means, for example, you have a Kafka
cluster, which you need always running.

133
00:08:37,949 --> 00:08:41,229
You use reserved instances
for that type of workloads.

134
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:43,399
There are spot instances.

135
00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:48,699
that are great for transient or flexible
workloads, allowing you to capitalize

136
00:08:48,699 --> 00:08:51,289
on lower cost during the off peak times.

137
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:56,009
This can be used for lower
priority schedule jobs that we

138
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:57,589
run in a distributed system.

139
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:01,159
The other thing that we can
do is automated governance.

140
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,219
Tagging is a key part
of automated governance.

141
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:09,749
Implement tagging and cost allocation
policies to monitor and control spend.

142
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:14,499
Leverage automation tools to
enforce these policies consistently.

143
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:20,259
for in AWS, you can take a look at
as service control policies, SCPs.

144
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,109
Let's take a look at
tools and technologies.

145
00:09:23,334 --> 00:09:25,404
For cloud cost and FinOps management.

146
00:09:26,244 --> 00:09:29,374
There is a robust ecosystem of tools
designed to help you manage cloud

147
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,484
costs and implement FinOps practices.

148
00:09:32,034 --> 00:09:36,474
Tools like AWS Cost Explorer,
Azure Cost Management, GCP Cost

149
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:40,264
Insights offer clear dashboards
that show all your cloud spending.

150
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:42,474
They break down your costs.

151
00:09:42,634 --> 00:09:45,884
By different categories such
as service region or team.

152
00:09:46,374 --> 00:09:49,894
This makes it easier to see where
your money is going and find ways to

153
00:09:49,894 --> 00:09:54,664
save tools like cloud custodian and
terraform help automate the management

154
00:09:54,674 --> 00:09:59,684
of your cloud class by Using code
to set up rules and controls With

155
00:09:59,694 --> 00:10:04,354
infrastructure as code, you can manage
resources and policies automatically

156
00:10:05,124 --> 00:10:06,854
without the need of minor intervention.

157
00:10:07,314 --> 00:10:11,964
This ensures that cost saving measures are
always in place and consistently followed.

158
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:17,274
This means that you can set rules for
how your resources are used and have

159
00:10:17,314 --> 00:10:19,134
those rules automatically enforced.

160
00:10:20,064 --> 00:10:23,704
Using these tools makes it easier
to manage costs and reduce mistakes.

161
00:10:24,204 --> 00:10:28,814
Advanced analytics and machine learning
help you predict your future cost.

162
00:10:29,224 --> 00:10:32,674
They can also spot unusual
spending from early on.

163
00:10:33,284 --> 00:10:36,854
This gives you time to fix
the problems before they grow.

164
00:10:37,794 --> 00:10:41,594
FinOps tools like Cloud Health
and AppTO give you detailed

165
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:43,334
insights into your cloud spending.

166
00:10:43,804 --> 00:10:48,974
They help teams from different engineering
orgs work together on managing costs.

167
00:10:49,434 --> 00:10:54,244
Using these tools creates a strong
unified system to keep your cloud

168
00:10:54,244 --> 00:10:56,464
spending optimized and at all the time.

169
00:10:56,784 --> 00:11:01,414
Now let's look at two real world examples
that illustrate the power of FinOps.

170
00:11:02,304 --> 00:11:07,724
In one case, we have a product team
that was consistently overspending due

171
00:11:07,724 --> 00:11:09,704
to overprovision compute resources.

172
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:16,524
They had three instances of like
overprovision VMs, which were like each

173
00:11:16,524 --> 00:11:19,374
application was using less than CPU.

174
00:11:19,984 --> 00:11:25,334
And they had a database server,
which was vertically scaled.

175
00:11:26,104 --> 00:11:27,714
Much more than they ever needed.

176
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,044
So what did this team do?

177
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:35,154
So they implemented right sizing
and established a regular FinOps

178
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:39,924
reviews, ensuring that their team was
accountable for their resource usage.

179
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,994
What was the outcome of this?

180
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:46,564
this proactive approach resulted
in 30 percent reduction in cost

181
00:11:46,864 --> 00:11:50,414
and a significant improvement
in resource efficiency.

182
00:11:50,914 --> 00:11:55,384
So let me take you on another case
study where there was a business unit

183
00:11:55,744 --> 00:12:00,024
that had budget constraints due to
unmanaged resource drop, with various

184
00:12:00,024 --> 00:12:02,744
teams deploying resources independently.

185
00:12:03,244 --> 00:12:07,994
By centralizing governance, enforcing
strict tagging policies, and holding

186
00:12:08,064 --> 00:12:12,444
cross functional financial reviews, they
improved visibility into their spending.

187
00:12:13,434 --> 00:12:14,734
What was the outcome of this?

188
00:12:15,004 --> 00:12:19,034
The BU not only achieved
significant cost savings, but also

189
00:12:19,094 --> 00:12:22,704
established a sustainable model
for continuous cost management.

190
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:28,114
These examples underscore how
integrating FinOps practices can

191
00:12:28,134 --> 00:12:32,514
transform your cloud spending from
reactive to proactive process.

192
00:12:32,804 --> 00:12:36,229
Now let's take a look at
building a road map to cloud

193
00:12:36,229 --> 00:12:38,029
cost optimization with FinOps.

194
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:42,179
So building a roadmap is
essential for long term success

195
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:43,439
in cloud cost optimization.

196
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:48,649
Here are some of the steps that you
need to do in order to get this working.

197
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:50,419
First, assessment.

198
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:53,499
So begin by auditing
your current cloud spend.

199
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:58,459
Use FinOps tools to establish
baselines and immediately identify

200
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:00,359
immediate areas for cost savings.

201
00:13:00,859 --> 00:13:01,349
Planning.

202
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,569
Define clear cost goals and
key performance indicators.

203
00:13:06,374 --> 00:13:11,474
This is also the time to form your cross
functional FinOps teams, bringing together

204
00:13:11,484 --> 00:13:14,054
FinOps, operations, and engineering.

205
00:13:14,554 --> 00:13:19,004
The next is implementation phase,
where roll out the cost optimization

206
00:13:19,004 --> 00:13:20,734
strategies and FinOps practices.

207
00:13:21,489 --> 00:13:22,539
We have discussed today.

208
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:28,179
Focus on automating governance,
right sizing resources and leveraging

209
00:13:28,189 --> 00:13:30,089
reserved and spot instances.

210
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:33,499
Last and not the least,
monitoring and iteration.

211
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:40,409
So using dashboards and regular FinOps
reviews to monitor progress and iterate.

212
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:46,719
Adjust your strategies based on real
time data and evolving business needs.

213
00:13:47,219 --> 00:13:50,499
Ensure that your cost
optimization plan aligns with

214
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,539
your overall business objectives.

215
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:58,099
Secure executive sponsorship to help
drive the culture shift necessary for

216
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,079
a successful FinOps implementation.

217
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:06,039
This roadmap is designed to be iterative
and adaptable, ensuring that your

218
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:11,599
business cloud cost management practices
remain effective as your business grows.

219
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:15,649
Drawing from industry experiences
and my own journey, here are some

220
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:19,409
of the best practices and lessons
learned from a FinOx perspective.

221
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:20,899
Integrate early.

222
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:26,399
So incorporate cost considerations
at the design phase of your projects.

223
00:14:26,704 --> 00:14:29,954
to avoid expensive reworks later.

224
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:35,504
Continuously monitor resource
usage and adjust allocations

225
00:14:35,534 --> 00:14:37,374
based on FinOps insights.

226
00:14:37,874 --> 00:14:42,854
Ensure that every team understands the
financial impact of their decisions

227
00:14:43,144 --> 00:14:45,564
through training and shared dashboards.

228
00:14:46,064 --> 00:14:47,914
Avoid one size fits all.

229
00:14:48,214 --> 00:14:49,874
Everyone has their own needs.

230
00:14:49,954 --> 00:14:52,224
Each team is different
from a different team.

231
00:14:52,234 --> 00:14:55,734
Some teams have different requirements.

232
00:14:56,294 --> 00:14:58,624
In compute than other teams.

233
00:14:58,944 --> 00:15:02,074
So tailor your Fino strategies
to the specific needs and

234
00:15:02,074 --> 00:15:03,924
usage patterns of each team.

235
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:05,444
Leverage automation.

236
00:15:06,044 --> 00:15:11,564
Automation reduces manual errors and
ensures consistency in policy enforcement.

237
00:15:12,064 --> 00:15:16,934
By embedding these practices into your
operational culture, you create a dynamic

238
00:15:16,934 --> 00:15:21,421
environment where cost efficiency is
part of the DNA of your organization.

239
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,964
all for your time and engagement today.

240
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:29,399
I hope you found these insights into
cloud cost efficiency and FinOps

241
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:31,479
both informative and actionable.
