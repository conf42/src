1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:06,210
Hello everyone, my name is, and
today I'm excited to share our

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,440
journey and insight on machine
learning and system modernization.

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,070
A critical topic for 2025 and beyond.

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,445
We are living in an era where technology
evolves faster than our nation can adopt.

5
00:00:20,305 --> 00:00:27,090
Legacy system legacy that once served
us well, have now become barriers.

6
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:27,780
It.

7
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,980
If we modernize, but how fast,
how smartly we can do it.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,410
Today, 60 to 80% of IT
budgets are consumed.

9
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,210
Just maintaining whole systems.

10
00:00:42,655 --> 00:00:48,144
That leaves very little room
for innovation and even less

11
00:00:48,144 --> 00:00:50,065
for competitive differentiation

12
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:52,545
is not.

13
00:00:54,585 --> 00:00:56,865
Servers are moving to the cloud.

14
00:00:57,195 --> 00:01:04,545
It's about rethinking the way business
operates, making system smarter, faster,

15
00:01:04,785 --> 00:01:07,215
and most importantly, feature proof.

16
00:01:07,905 --> 00:01:13,005
Without modernization, organizations
face air costs slower response

17
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:18,315
to the market changes and
frustrated customers and employers.

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,729
So legacy modernization is essential in
today's digital landscape organization.

19
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:33,119
Face technical, operational, and human
challenges while balancing system

20
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:39,509
reliability With modern capabilities,
including cloud AI and advanced analytics,

21
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:43,574
we shall explore the strategic approaches.

22
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,520
Performance considerations and
implementation methodologies

23
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,350
for successful moderation.

24
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,770
Focusing on based implementation,
stakeholder management, and technology

25
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,720
integration that maintains system
stability throughout the transformation.

26
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,394
Okay, let's talk about the
strategic overview and challenges.

27
00:02:07,924 --> 00:02:09,815
Modernizing is tough.

28
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,260
There are three big challenges.

29
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:14,989
The first, the financial burden.

30
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:20,420
Big transformation requires
investment before you see returns.

31
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:27,829
Legacy system, 60 to 80% of IT
budget severely limiting resources

32
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,239
for digital innovation and
competitive growth initiatives.

33
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,760
Second, the.

34
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,739
Legacy process and organizational
culture resist transformation.

35
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:47,040
Three quarters of organizations identify
outdated infrastructure as the critical

36
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,040
roadblock, preventing deployment of
modern digital services and capabilities.

37
00:02:53,879 --> 00:03:01,799
And the third balancing performance
and innovation Legacy systems, 99.9%.

38
00:03:03,644 --> 00:03:07,815
Lack essential agility, effective
modernization strategies, maintain

39
00:03:07,845 --> 00:03:15,105
operational stability while introducing
advanced technology capabilities.

40
00:03:16,105 --> 00:03:21,954
So we must keep critical systems
stable while introducing newer,

41
00:03:22,554 --> 00:03:26,635
riskier technologies like
AI and real time analytics.

42
00:03:27,204 --> 00:03:29,874
It's like fixing an airplane.

43
00:03:30,249 --> 00:03:33,399
Where while it's still flying.

44
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:35,689
Let's talk about the numbers.

45
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:43,069
Imagine slashing cash cost by up to
30%, improving system response by

46
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:48,109
60% and boosting market adapt by 35%.

47
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:49,819
That's the moderation.

48
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:54,169
Promising success is not technology alone.

49
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:55,669
Its.

50
00:03:56,929 --> 00:04:01,999
Tangible business outcomes like
adaptability and customer satisfaction.

51
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:04,879
So do we measure success.

52
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:12,289
In modern, we use clear hard
metrics, 15 to 30% cost reduction.

53
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:17,479
Successful moderation project typically
achieve significant operational cost

54
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:24,794
savings, 40 to 60% faster System
responses, improvement in system response.

55
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:27,619
Time after successful modernization,

56
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:34,399
25 to 35% better adaptable
to market changes.

57
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:40,399
This will enhance ability to respond to
market changes and customer needs, and

58
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:44,209
aiming for 99.9% system availability.

59
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:46,669
Nearly perfect time.

60
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:50,659
So maintain throughout the transition
is successful transformation.

61
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:53,629
So these are not just big goals.

62
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,789
Their directly impact customer experience,
revenue, and long-term survival.

63
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:05,669
If we talk about the performance
architecture considerations for current

64
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,740
legacy and modern system, and we will
talk about the impact assessment.

65
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,630
So architectural discussion today
determine whether we through

66
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,800
tomorrow scalability, the silence.

67
00:05:20,324 --> 00:05:24,734
And flexibility must be at
the heart of every edition.

68
00:05:26,864 --> 00:05:33,884
Hybrid cloud, microservices and
ation are no longer buzzwords.

69
00:05:34,874 --> 00:05:39,194
They are the building blocks
for a responsive enterprise.

70
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:45,344
If you look at the moderation
aspects, if we compare with

71
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:47,534
current legacy and modern system.

72
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,760
The transformation transition
processing the legacy system, it

73
00:05:53,760 --> 00:06:00,510
is handling 1 million transaction
per day with 99.99% reliability.

74
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,690
And if you can, if you see that modern
system, 40 to 50% better resources,

75
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:13,080
utilization, that really the impact
is high positive impact on response

76
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,780
time, milliseconds response time.

77
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,729
But if you use the modern system, it's
gonna be 65% faster time to market,

78
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:27,870
significant improvement, operational
costs, baseline costs, and then it's

79
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,270
gonna reduce 40% in modernized system.

80
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,430
Major cost savings over here.

81
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,979
Let's talk about cloud migration patterns.

82
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,010
Moderation also demands rethinking
of technical foundations.

83
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:49,890
We prioritize scalability,
the silence, flexibility.

84
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,210
So scalability system that
can grow as business grows.

85
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:03,120
The silence system that recovers instantly
from failures, flexibility system ready

86
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,190
for ai, automation and feature tech.

87
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:11,849
So cloud migration plays a
massive role, but migration.

88
00:07:12,254 --> 00:07:20,234
Is not just lift and shift, we carefully
choose between rehosting, replatforming,

89
00:07:20,655 --> 00:07:23,324
and refactoring based on business needs.

90
00:07:23,984 --> 00:07:29,205
Choosing the right migration pattern
ensures we are not just moving problem

91
00:07:29,205 --> 00:07:32,054
to the cloud, we are solving them.

92
00:07:33,314 --> 00:07:38,744
The six R approach provides a
structured framework for moving advocacy

93
00:07:38,804 --> 00:07:40,724
applications to cloud environments.

94
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:46,049
Organisms carefully evaluate each
application against these patterns.

95
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:53,729
Considering factors such as business
criticality, technical dip, and

96
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:56,039
required performance levels,

97
00:07:58,619 --> 00:08:04,979
the strangler big patterns has
emerged as a particularly effecti.

98
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:10,239
Replace legacy functionality while
maintaining system stability.

99
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,729
It studies showing successful
implementation, achieving a 30

100
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:20,289
to 40% reduction in risk compared
to the big Bang approaches.

101
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:26,515
If you see the user experience
and change management.

102
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:31,905
Technology alone does not drive success.

103
00:08:33,195 --> 00:08:34,425
It's the people.

104
00:08:35,655 --> 00:08:40,965
A shocking 70% of digital transformation
fail because of poor change

105
00:08:40,965 --> 00:08:43,965
management, not poor technology.

106
00:08:44,805 --> 00:08:52,665
To overcome this, we focus on
gradual interface improvements, 80.

107
00:08:55,095 --> 00:09:01,005
Success rate when organization implement
incremental changes to user interfaces,

108
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:03,555
allowing for adoption and feedback

109
00:09:05,715 --> 00:09:06,795
change champions.

110
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:14,535
So 80% of success rate when organization
like change champions compared to

111
00:09:14,835 --> 00:09:21,315
just 30% success without dedicated
adoption leaders complete system or.

112
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:30,329
Only 35% success rate with all at one
system changes, creating significant

113
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,030
disruption and adoption challenges.

114
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:40,925
And the last one is dig digital adaptation
platforms, organizations implementing

115
00:09:40,925 --> 00:09:48,630
comprehensive digital adaptation platforms
experience 50% user adoption rate.

116
00:09:49,665 --> 00:09:52,845
45% reduction in support tickets.

117
00:09:54,645 --> 00:10:01,425
If we don't manage that well, even
the best technology will be rejected.

118
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:11,205
Training and supporting strategies,
training should not be an afterthought.

119
00:10:11,715 --> 00:10:16,395
It should be embedded into the
modernization journey from day one.

120
00:10:18,405 --> 00:10:24,645
Documentation and interactive feedback
loops creates self-sufficient users

121
00:10:25,215 --> 00:10:28,095
and drastically reduce support costs.

122
00:10:29,115 --> 00:10:36,285
Comprehensive training, interactive
e-learning modules, and micro running

123
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:44,325
segments, and modern documentation like
videos, tutorials, and interactive guide.

124
00:10:45,765 --> 00:10:51,224
Chain champions, network advocates
across departments and feedback

125
00:10:51,224 --> 00:10:53,865
systems, real-time user input channels.

126
00:10:54,525 --> 00:11:00,375
So organization implementing real-time
feedback system report, a 65% implement

127
00:11:00,405 --> 00:11:04,574
in system usability and user satisfaction.

128
00:11:05,594 --> 00:11:10,035
Modern documentation approaches
including video tutorials

129
00:11:10,395 --> 00:11:13,910
and interactive guides, 75%.

130
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:18,840
Better knowledge retention
compared to traditional methods.

131
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,170
Okay.

132
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,010
Innovation, integration and technology.

133
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,370
So mission learning and are
becoming the heart of modernization.

134
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,260
We use AI to predict customer behavior.

135
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:41,560
Optimize operations
detect an in real time.

136
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:50,380
Meanwhile, the other microservices
architecture breakdown mono system

137
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:56,439
into smaller dependent parts, making
them more flexible and silent.

138
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:03,700
Also embarrass embracing
mobile first and self service.

139
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,050
Technologies empower customers
and employees reducing operational

140
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,000
cost and boosting satisfaction.

141
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:16,060
The AI mission learning organizations
implementing AI driven analytic

142
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:21,820
experience, 25 to 30% implement
indecision making accuracy, and three

143
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,890
by percent reduction in processing
time for complex transactions.

144
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,970
45% higher success rate with
the structured approach.

145
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:36,310
If you take it, mobile and self
services organization, prioritizing

146
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:42,760
mobile first approaches achieves 55%
higher user engagement rates, 45%

147
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,890
increase in service accessibility,
and 30% reduction in support costs.

148
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:54,250
So microservice architecture organization
adopts microservice, Experian, 33%

149
00:12:54,250 --> 00:13:00,160
I improvement in system flexibility,
28% reduction in deployment type.

150
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:05,230
40%. Integration issues,
fewer integration issues,

151
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,840
migration and strategy and implementation.

152
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:16,940
Risk assessment, when is going to
be 65% fewer critical incidents

153
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,130
and phase implementation.

154
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:24,950
It's gonna be three x higher success
rate and integration patterns.

155
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,500
It'll reduce 50% reduction in
downtime and AI assisted testing.

156
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:36,170
75% more issues identified
redeployment itself.

157
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:43,069
While 94% of organizations acknowledge
the need for legacy system migration,

158
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:49,370
only 25%, 28% report successful
completion of their modernization project.

159
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,810
Organizations leveraging
large language model.

160
00:13:54,725 --> 00:14:02,015
For code analysis and documentation
achieved 45% faster migration planning,

161
00:14:02,465 --> 00:14:06,425
and 60% more accurate dependency mapping,

162
00:14:07,425 --> 00:14:10,484
stakeholder management and value delivery.

163
00:14:11,444 --> 00:14:17,354
So the comprehensive RO 80, tracking
the organizations implementing

164
00:14:18,045 --> 00:14:19,754
value tracking framework.

165
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:28,155
2.5 times higher stakeholders buy-in,
and 40% better resource allocations

166
00:14:28,665 --> 00:14:33,645
and realtime progress visualization
organizations utilizing realtime

167
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:39,314
progress visualization tools achieve
70% better alignment between technical

168
00:14:39,314 --> 00:14:41,295
teams and business stakeholders.

169
00:14:42,285 --> 00:14:44,775
So to the performance monitoring.

170
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:51,060
Organizations implementing comprehensive
performance monitoring framework identify

171
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:58,560
60 per 65% more optimization opportunities
and achieve 50% better business

172
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,170
outcomes and the long-term support.

173
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:06,149
Planning organizations with well-defined
support strategies achieve 45%

174
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:11,609
better system sustainability and
35% lower total cost of ownership.

175
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:18,609
Okay, so what are the takeaway,
key takeaways, and next steps?

176
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:22,539
Let's wrap up with the a few takeaway.

177
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:24,759
Few key takeaways.

178
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:28,299
Balance, stability with innovation.

179
00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:36,729
Do not sacrifice one for the another,
so ensure continuous operation while

180
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,529
introducing advanced capabilities.

181
00:15:39,609 --> 00:15:43,959
Through strategic planning and
methodological implementation phases,

182
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:47,829
prioritize people, not just technology.

183
00:15:48,729 --> 00:15:54,129
So invest in change management,
such as in cloud solutions.

184
00:15:55,119 --> 00:16:00,729
So we need to allocate 15 to 20% of
your moderation budget to comprehensive

185
00:16:00,729 --> 00:16:08,109
training programs, technical support
and adoption acceleration in situs.

186
00:16:09,174 --> 00:16:16,794
Measure success holistically, cost
savings, agility, adaptability,

187
00:16:17,274 --> 00:16:19,974
and user satisfaction all matters.

188
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:25,404
So when we implement robust tracking
of both the technical performance

189
00:16:26,214 --> 00:16:33,984
metric and the business outcome, to
demonstrate tangible ROI and sustain

190
00:16:33,984 --> 00:16:36,294
executive stakeholder commitment.

191
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,229
The last one is adopt
face phased approach.

192
00:16:42,229 --> 00:16:46,599
It should be a phase adopt phased
approach, not a big bang approach.

193
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,469
Transformation is a
marathon, not a sprint.

194
00:16:51,369 --> 00:16:56,770
So execute migration through
strategic incremental steps with

195
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,199
well-defined success milestones to.

196
00:17:00,355 --> 00:17:05,694
Threefold higher success rate compared
to all at once implementations.

197
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:15,204
So moderation is not just a tech project,
it's a business evaluation strategy.

198
00:17:18,145 --> 00:17:20,425
Thank you all for your attention.

199
00:17:22,645 --> 00:17:27,295
Mission learning and moderation
are not just futuristic trends.

200
00:17:28,389 --> 00:17:35,379
They are the foundation of sustainability,
silent and innovative enterprises.

201
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,930
I look forward to discuss discussing
this more during the session.

202
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,830
Thank you.
