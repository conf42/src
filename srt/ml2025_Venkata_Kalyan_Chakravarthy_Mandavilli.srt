00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,750
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,140
This is Winker Karti man from SCO Texas.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,840
I'm an SAP project manager
having 21 years of experience in

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,709
S-A-P-I-I handled multiple clients
belongs to multiple industry like

5
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:15,450
manufacturing, food, and period.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,650
When I started my career in SAP
Abap, I started working with R

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,440
3.3, and then later my current
experiences goes with s Foura 2023.

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,819
In between this many years I worked with
several clients several team members

9
00:00:30,819 --> 00:00:36,309
and from different countries like India
China, Japan Germany, and different

10
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:37,959
European and Asia Pacific countries.

11
00:00:38,589 --> 00:00:42,730
I have experience working with the
manufacturing and food processing

12
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,039
companies as an SAP project manager.

13
00:00:45,499 --> 00:00:50,644
I'm also like SAP certified Project
manager and PMP certified AWS

14
00:00:50,644 --> 00:00:52,849
certified and SCRUM certified.

15
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:55,459
So this is my overall SAP experience.

16
00:00:55,459 --> 00:01:00,259
Today I'm going to talk about the topic
of transforming business efficiency,

17
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,470
the role of AI in SAP and ERP system.

18
00:01:04,175 --> 00:01:10,374
How this AI in SAP is
affecting the AI ERP systems.

19
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:15,235
So artificial intelligence is
fundamentally transforming SAP and

20
00:01:15,235 --> 00:01:17,304
Enterprise Resource Planning Systems.

21
00:01:17,335 --> 00:01:21,115
It's like creating un unprecedented
opportunities for business to

22
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:24,955
enhance operational efficiency,
improve decision making, and deliver.

23
00:01:25,344 --> 00:01:30,384
Superior user experience, which
you can see on my screen, which I'm

24
00:01:30,384 --> 00:01:34,934
talking about SAP AI and ERP systems.

25
00:01:35,384 --> 00:01:40,274
This presentation explores how
AI integration is recognizing

26
00:01:40,724 --> 00:01:43,214
enterprise systems through automation.

27
00:01:43,585 --> 00:01:48,595
Ate your task evaluation of breakthrough
analytics and enhance user interfaces.

28
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:52,665
And we'll see how technologies are
reshaping and how business operates

29
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:55,265
and interact with their core systems.

30
00:01:55,295 --> 00:02:00,064
This is the overall topic which I'm
going to talk today about role of

31
00:02:00,124 --> 00:02:07,174
AI in SAP and ERP systems, how the
AI revolution is enterprise system.

32
00:02:07,244 --> 00:02:11,284
Let's see different things like
market growth, cost reduction,

33
00:02:11,884 --> 00:02:18,064
revenue growth, how market growth
is affecting the AI in ERP.

34
00:02:18,154 --> 00:02:24,274
The global ERP market is projected
to reach 97.2 billion by 2024, with

35
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:29,644
78% of oration reporting at least 25%
improvement in operational efficiency

36
00:02:30,004 --> 00:02:32,434
following strategic AI integration.

37
00:02:32,734 --> 00:02:38,644
Means we can see that most of the EIP
markets right now trying to move to AI

38
00:02:38,644 --> 00:02:43,474
revolution and also how it is affecting
the cost reduction companies implementing

39
00:02:43,474 --> 00:02:48,544
AI and answer SAP solutions have
achieved an average of 32% reduction in

40
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:53,254
operational cost within the first year
with automation of routine process.

41
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:58,594
Eliminating up to 40% of manual
workload means we can clearly see that.

42
00:02:59,494 --> 00:03:04,654
Manual workload is getting reduced
and AI is coming into the game.

43
00:03:05,134 --> 00:03:09,154
That's what we can see, where we can see
the cost reduction, where companies are

44
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:13,084
ideally thinking about cost reduction
when it comes to the budget, and also

45
00:03:13,084 --> 00:03:17,554
the revenue growth, how the orations
are making mature integration with

46
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:20,614
the RP system so that they can grow.

47
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:21,664
Revenue wise.

48
00:03:21,664 --> 00:03:25,354
Also, we can see the revenue growth
are 2.3, higher revenue growth compared

49
00:03:25,354 --> 00:03:30,304
to industry periods with 65% reporting
significant improvements in customer

50
00:03:30,304 --> 00:03:33,184
satisfaction and retention rates.

51
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:38,074
Let's see, automation of
repetitive task invoice processing.

52
00:03:38,074 --> 00:03:42,334
So invoice processing is one of the
most important thing where most of

53
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:44,704
the companies use manual processing.

54
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:48,134
Some person is going to use any
like software or something like

55
00:03:48,134 --> 00:03:49,694
that and process the invoice.

56
00:03:49,724 --> 00:03:54,154
But let's see how AI is helping
here, like AI systems demonstrate.

57
00:03:54,664 --> 00:03:59,404
Demonstrated remarkable efficiency
gains with improved automated matching

58
00:03:59,404 --> 00:04:03,665
accuracy and decreased processing cycle
times compared to traditional methods

59
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:07,624
means we can see that the automated
invoice processing is taken care by

60
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:12,754
AI so that the workload can be reduced
and manual processing can be reduced.

61
00:04:12,814 --> 00:04:16,314
This is one of the revolution that
we can see and also we see the

62
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:20,514
systems demonstrate self-learning
capabilities with no error rates.

63
00:04:21,024 --> 00:04:22,254
Sometimes manual.

64
00:04:22,314 --> 00:04:23,544
We may see some errors.

65
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:28,939
Person made some errors while issuing
invoices, but this AI capabilities

66
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:34,189
will remove the error and it's
like error free invoice processing.

67
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:36,319
And the next one is order management.

68
00:04:37,309 --> 00:04:41,149
Why AI is implementing order management.

69
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:41,719
Let's see.

70
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:45,619
Studies examining and manufacturing
enterprise documented significant

71
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:49,789
reductions in order processing
time, swallowing AI implementation.

72
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:55,234
Audit accuracy improved translating to
substantial annual savings through the

73
00:04:55,234 --> 00:04:59,704
elimination of costs associated with
other corrections, returns, processing,

74
00:04:59,704 --> 00:05:01,744
and customer service interventions.

75
00:05:02,014 --> 00:05:06,874
And also we see that order management
is also saying that they are going to

76
00:05:07,154 --> 00:05:12,794
eliminate errors and all those things,
and they're going to see that how

77
00:05:12,794 --> 00:05:16,364
the cost is associated with the order
corrections, processing returns, and

78
00:05:16,364 --> 00:05:18,644
all those things, compliance monitoring.

79
00:05:19,124 --> 00:05:23,774
Compliance monitoring, ai, power
monitoring solutions are identified as

80
00:05:23,774 --> 00:05:25,934
much higher percentage of compliance.

81
00:05:26,274 --> 00:05:30,144
And they say okay, as reportable
incidents compared to conventional

82
00:05:30,144 --> 00:05:33,894
rule-based systems, okay, AI
is taking care of compliance.

83
00:05:33,894 --> 00:05:37,584
Now it is monitoring, it's following
the rules, and it's saying that, okay

84
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:40,374
incidents will be reported and error free.

85
00:05:40,704 --> 00:05:44,184
This proactive identification
capability translated to remission

86
00:05:44,184 --> 00:05:45,804
in compliance related to panel.

87
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:49,524
Decrease audit preparation time.

88
00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:50,124
Okay.

89
00:05:50,124 --> 00:05:54,084
Like in compliance, if the auditing is
not done properly, then you see some

90
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:56,154
fines and regular issues will be there.

91
00:05:56,454 --> 00:06:00,414
But AI is saying that, okay, I'm
going to reduce all these things.

92
00:06:00,414 --> 00:06:04,434
I'm going to decrease the ities
and the preparation time too.

93
00:06:04,434 --> 00:06:10,164
This is how we can see how AI in ERP
systems and automation, which is like

94
00:06:10,164 --> 00:06:12,674
the repetitive task, will be eliminated.

95
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,294
Let's see.

96
00:06:15,284 --> 00:06:19,394
What we are going to talk about
predictive analytics and forecasting.

97
00:06:19,604 --> 00:06:19,964
Okay.

98
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:24,764
The most important things in any business
is like demand forecasting, financial risk

99
00:06:24,764 --> 00:06:27,524
enhancement, supply chain optimization.

100
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:27,974
Okay.

101
00:06:27,974 --> 00:06:28,394
Let's see.

102
00:06:28,394 --> 00:06:33,254
Demand forecasting A and S planning
solution documented significant

103
00:06:33,254 --> 00:06:36,849
forecast accuracy improvements
compared to traditional time series

104
00:06:36,974 --> 00:06:41,894
forecasting methods, decreasing cost
while improving product availability.

105
00:06:42,974 --> 00:06:44,834
Also financial risk assessment.

106
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:48,404
AI and S transaction monitoring
identified a high percentage of

107
00:06:48,404 --> 00:06:52,934
fraud led activities before payment
execution, representing a substantial

108
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:58,424
improvement over rule based detection
systems, supply chain optimization.

109
00:06:58,964 --> 00:07:03,074
Predictive AI models reduce supply
chain dis disruptions by identifying

110
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:09,534
potential bottlenecks, supply risk, and
de demand before they impacted operations.

111
00:07:10,554 --> 00:07:14,634
We are seeing that AI is taking
charge of predictive analytics and

112
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:18,714
forecasting, and we are seeing that
it is going to reduce the cost.

113
00:07:18,744 --> 00:07:23,304
It is going to reduce the risk, and it
is going to reduce the fraud and it is

114
00:07:23,304 --> 00:07:25,464
making supply chain process very easy.

115
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:32,724
Move to next slide, and as decision making
capabilities so improve decision quality,

116
00:07:33,114 --> 00:07:35,274
better outcomes in dynamic environment.

117
00:07:36,174 --> 00:07:41,709
Advanced anm, a detection, early
identification of issues, inventory

118
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:45,549
optimization, reduce access
while improving availability,

119
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:49,479
financial intelligence, better cash
forecasting and capital allocation.

120
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:53,739
So these four are very important
while taking any decision.

121
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:58,749
So AI is also evolving now to make sure
that it is enhanced decision making

122
00:07:58,749 --> 00:08:03,729
capability, so that improved decision
quality, advance analytic detection,

123
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:08,559
inventory optimization, financial
intelligence for better cash forecast

124
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:10,899
forecasting and capital allocation.

125
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:15,819
All nations utilizing AI Argumented
SAP analytics experience to

126
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:20,649
improve decision quality and reduce
decision latency compared to the

127
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:22,329
conventional analysis approaches.

128
00:08:22,854 --> 00:08:26,514
These improvements were particularly
pronounced in dynamic business

129
00:08:26,514 --> 00:08:31,614
and environments where Rapid data
assimilation translated directly to,

130
00:08:31,614 --> 00:08:37,134
compared to advantages we see there is
lots of improvement is going to happen

131
00:08:37,494 --> 00:08:40,164
when SAP is now integrated with ERP.

132
00:08:41,484 --> 00:08:42,744
Let's move the next slide.

133
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:43,239
Okay.

134
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:48,714
Now it is saying that how AI is
going to enhance the user experience.

135
00:08:49,194 --> 00:08:52,435
Right now we are seeing lots of
apps are coming, but again, we'll

136
00:08:52,435 --> 00:08:57,114
see like how AI announced the
user experience for ERP systems.

137
00:08:57,594 --> 00:09:02,904
Conventional interfaces solution like
SAP Joel and SAP Co-pilot enables users

138
00:09:02,904 --> 00:09:08,694
to complex workflow, more efficient
and traditional menu drive interfaces.

139
00:09:09,204 --> 00:09:13,104
These natural languages capability
reduce the technical knowledge barrier.

140
00:09:13,464 --> 00:09:16,404
Then historically limited, ERP adoption.

141
00:09:17,184 --> 00:09:21,754
Means we can see like a layman who is
not into the SAP technologies, like

142
00:09:21,754 --> 00:09:25,744
when we do SAP implementations, the
clients, some of the clients, they

143
00:09:25,744 --> 00:09:29,494
don't have SAP experience, but still
using these particular interfaces, they

144
00:09:29,494 --> 00:09:32,804
can also easily use SAP capabilities.

145
00:09:32,894 --> 00:09:33,284
Let's see.

146
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:37,994
The intelligent assistance, a power
assistance transform navigation in

147
00:09:38,054 --> 00:09:39,944
complex ERP and NEUR environment.

148
00:09:39,944 --> 00:09:43,784
By providing context aware
guidance, they reduce errors

149
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:45,464
while accelerating processes.

150
00:09:46,064 --> 00:09:49,184
Through proactive suggestions,
particularly complex areas

151
00:09:49,184 --> 00:09:51,194
like financial consolidations.

152
00:09:51,804 --> 00:09:56,154
In the ERP systems, it is helping,
intelligent assistant is helping reducing

153
00:09:56,154 --> 00:09:59,934
the address, which we already discussed
in our previous slides, and saying

154
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:05,034
that, okay, I'll take care of everything
proactively and give the suggestions.

155
00:10:05,034 --> 00:10:10,044
Complex areas and financial
consolidations will be taken care by ai.

156
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:12,054
Personalized experience.

157
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:14,664
AI en enabled adaptive interfaces.

158
00:10:15,055 --> 00:10:17,035
Improve information processing.

159
00:10:17,244 --> 00:10:22,494
Decision quality research demonstrate
that AI driven, ation optimized

160
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:28,584
interaction path, minimizing load
while maximizing inside delivery.

161
00:10:29,515 --> 00:10:33,744
It is also taking care of interfaces
for the information processing

162
00:10:33,744 --> 00:10:38,395
decision quality means we can see
going forward the improvement of the

163
00:10:38,395 --> 00:10:43,214
quality, which is really enhance the
personalized experience of the users.

164
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,930
Let's go to the next one.

165
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,030
Generative AI integration.

166
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:52,529
Right now we see like generative AI is
all, all over, like LinkedIn, all over

167
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:57,209
industrial area, and people also getting
certified when you do a PM certification.

168
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:03,280
You also suggested by PMP team to do
generative ai, p and p. Why generative AI

169
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,740
integration is coming into the picture.

170
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,440
In a RP, let's see, the contents.

171
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:14,360
Automated content creation code
generation enhance chart boards.

172
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:18,650
Okay, let's see what is Automated
content creation significantly

173
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:22,400
reduce effort for producing
business communications and reports.

174
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,840
Beyond time saving these systems
improve information consistency

175
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,195
through standardized formatting and
integrating validation frameworks means.

176
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:36,830
In like instead of doing manual reports,
this one is to taking care of creation of

177
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:41,180
reports different type of reports, like
budget reports or like status reports or

178
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,470
anything which is related to the business.

179
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,589
And it is also standardizing the
formatting, so you don't need

180
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:48,780
to worry about the formatting.

181
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,319
Okay.

182
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,400
That is one thing.

183
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,410
Second thing for the
developers code generation.

184
00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:58,420
Transform application development
within SAP environment means it

185
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,040
is going to generate the code.

186
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:05,719
Then we are seeing that okay, going
forward, SAP developers will be reduced

187
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:10,969
and this AI integration will be playing
a major role to generate the code.

188
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:14,449
We know, like people, we are seeing
so many code generator tools for

189
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:18,049
different technologies, not only
for SAP, for different T net,

190
00:12:18,109 --> 00:12:19,769
the Java, et cetera, et cetera.

191
00:12:20,144 --> 00:12:22,874
But again, when it comes to SAP
environment, it is saying that,

192
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:26,894
okay, intelligent tool accelerated
development workflows will be improved.

193
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:29,864
Code quality improved to the applications.

194
00:12:29,894 --> 00:12:33,614
Consistent applications of architectural
patterns means like it is following

195
00:12:33,614 --> 00:12:36,404
the standard SAP code technology.

196
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:39,119
Okay, and let's see what's next.

197
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:43,349
Enhance the chat bots Modern AI
power system resolve most user

198
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,779
inquiries without human intervention.

199
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,829
These systems maintain contextual
awareness across conservations and

200
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:54,449
effectively address complex inquiries that
previously require specialized support.

201
00:12:54,869 --> 00:13:00,449
See, we are seeing the modern technology
is trying to make sure that it is giving

202
00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:05,229
like conceptual awareness to the users
and also address the complex inquiries.

203
00:13:05,245 --> 00:13:09,865
So it is always talking about reducing
the frauds, giving you, reducing the

204
00:13:09,865 --> 00:13:13,565
complex issues and giving you the
what do you say, like the specialized

205
00:13:13,565 --> 00:13:14,915
support and all those things.

206
00:13:16,685 --> 00:13:21,815
Let's see, AI assisted information
interaction, so how AI is helping us

207
00:13:21,815 --> 00:13:24,395
to get the interaction information.

208
00:13:24,395 --> 00:13:29,915
So smart summarization enhance
analytics, natural language filtering.

209
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,030
Conceptual recommendations.

210
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:36,619
I'm not going deep into this all topics,
but based on the headlines, we can see

211
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:41,920
like how it is helping us reducing all
this transformation, lengthy reports

212
00:13:42,219 --> 00:13:47,229
and accelerate complex workflows
and also enables conversation data

213
00:13:47,229 --> 00:13:52,719
exploration delivers faster, comparing
to traditional SQL based query interfaces

214
00:13:52,989 --> 00:13:54,430
and also it's a recommendation.

215
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,160
User needs intelligent,
surfacing relevant actions.

216
00:13:57,655 --> 00:14:01,344
Connections and insight based on
current activities, historical patterns.

217
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:02,665
Ordination.

218
00:14:02,665 --> 00:14:09,205
So most of the ordination now leveraging
ai, enhanced analytical respond 40% faster

219
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:13,915
to changing business conditions means if
you see, if you have an SAP experience,

220
00:14:13,915 --> 00:14:15,685
there are bi analytical reports.

221
00:14:16,045 --> 00:14:16,375
Okay?

222
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:21,805
Now this AI is helping us to
respond 40% faster, comparing to

223
00:14:21,805 --> 00:14:23,605
the regular bi analytical reports.

224
00:14:23,605 --> 00:14:25,615
So this is like a game changer.

225
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:29,115
So it means how your internet
is speed based on your internet.

226
00:14:29,115 --> 00:14:35,005
Your computers are working similarly,
this SAP reports give you faster reports.

227
00:14:35,215 --> 00:14:39,749
This will really improve the information
accessibility and also visualization.

228
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:44,519
These capabilities deliver exceptional
value in data intensive environments

229
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,444
where information, volume, and
complexity would otherwise over him.

230
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,484
Human continue capacity.

231
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:52,329
Let's see.

232
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:57,309
Business benefits from AI
intelligence, operational efficiency,

233
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,199
reduce, we discussed already.

234
00:14:59,229 --> 00:15:04,869
It'll reduce manual processing and time
significantly in financial services.

235
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:10,869
Next one is financial management
improves cash forecasting, accuracy

236
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:15,699
in manufacturing inventory management,
decrease holding cost in retail operation.

237
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:18,879
Customer service, that is one
of the most important thing.

238
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:23,679
Enhance the sort accuracy across
distribution networks means if you take

239
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,519
example of my current project where
I'm working as a project manager for

240
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,259
Levi's, like they have so many orders
in the distribution centers, so this

241
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:36,729
will definitely help them to enhance
their distribution across the network.

242
00:15:37,405 --> 00:15:40,614
And also compliances accelerate
regulatory issue detection,

243
00:15:40,614 --> 00:15:45,415
healthcare decision making, minimize
response time, telecommunication.

244
00:15:45,464 --> 00:15:50,084
Okay, AI is taking, it is minimizing
response time in telecommunication

245
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:54,254
supply chain lowers disruption
rate in manufacturing environments.

246
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,884
User experience, like we discussed
about the apps and all those things

247
00:15:57,884 --> 00:16:02,624
is boost the performance and also
system adoption within professional

248
00:16:02,684 --> 00:16:05,594
services means it says it's easy to use.

249
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:07,784
Let's move to next slide.

250
00:16:08,624 --> 00:16:09,584
Future implications.

251
00:16:09,614 --> 00:16:14,354
Okay, now using the S-A-S-A-P,
AI integration, ERP, what

252
00:16:14,354 --> 00:16:15,644
are the future implications?

253
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:16,154
Let's see.

254
00:16:16,664 --> 00:16:20,084
Autonomous operations 2026 to 2028.

255
00:16:20,624 --> 00:16:23,324
Predict maintenance, 2025 to 2027.

256
00:16:23,864 --> 00:16:27,014
Cross system intelligence, 2026 to 2029.

257
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:29,264
Self-optimizing supply chain.

258
00:16:29,294 --> 00:16:30,704
20 25, 20 27.

259
00:16:30,764 --> 00:16:31,184
Let's see.

260
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:35,399
And autonomous operations, meaningless
system, increasingly capable of

261
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:40,259
executing complex business process
with minimal oversight, extending

262
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:43,709
beyond simple transaction to
sophisticated decision process.

263
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:48,599
Next, we'll see the rapid advancement
as operational technology integrates

264
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:52,079
with the enterprise systems, reducing
downtime and maintenance costs

265
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,579
through more precise scheduling.

266
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:57,939
So it's, it is going to reduce
the downtime of the systems.

267
00:16:58,314 --> 00:17:03,765
And also maintenance cost, which is most
important for most of the organizations.

268
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:08,185
Cross system intelligence,
transgendering traditional application

269
00:17:08,185 --> 00:17:12,115
boundaries to deliver unified
insights across business functions.

270
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:16,915
Enhancing all national agility through
faster response to market changes,

271
00:17:17,545 --> 00:17:19,380
self-optimizing supply chains.

272
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:24,040
A orchestrated spanning multiple
application, improving strategic

273
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:29,500
alignment and reducing supply chain
cost by 41%, which is like game changer.

274
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,600
We'll move to the next slide.

275
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,100
Conclusion,

276
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,040
a paring shift in enterprise
technology, operational transformation,

277
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:43,000
fundamentally redefining efficiency
across business functions.

278
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,260
Decision quality enhancements, which
we already discussed, the operational

279
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,310
transformation we discussed.

280
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,890
What is the decision making?

281
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:55,270
Quality enhancement enable more informed
strategic decision through data-driven

282
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:00,370
insights, user experience, revolution,
creating intelligent digital ecosystem

283
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,830
that adapt to changing requirements.

284
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,950
The integration of AI within SAP and
DIP system represents the shift to that

285
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,560
extent far beyond incremental improvement.

286
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,910
Companies that successfully leverage
these capabilities are positioned

287
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,680
to operate with greater efficiency.

288
00:18:18,385 --> 00:18:21,865
Respond more effectively to
market changes and make more

289
00:18:21,865 --> 00:18:23,815
informal strategic decisions.

290
00:18:24,445 --> 00:18:28,165
Organization that embrace these
technological advancements are not merely

291
00:18:28,165 --> 00:18:34,015
as IT implementations, but as strategic
capabilities will fundamentally reshape

292
00:18:34,015 --> 00:18:39,715
their operational models and competitive
positioning in an increasing digital data.

293
00:18:39,715 --> 00:18:41,875
Driven in future means.

294
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:46,470
We can see this AI within S-A-P-R-P
systems represents extended.

295
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,330
For beyond incremental improvements.

296
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:52,030
The improvements which we already
discussed about the operational

297
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:56,760
transformation, decision quality,
user experience reducing the errors,

298
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:02,030
processing the invoice faster and
also reducing the fraudulent things.

299
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:07,260
So orations like most of the nationals
adopt these technologies advancements

300
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:11,230
not only for IT implementations,
but also for other strategic

301
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,460
fundamental business operations.

302
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:14,990
Let's see.

303
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:15,770
That's it.

304
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:16,730
Thank you.

305
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,260
Thank you very much.

306
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,760
It's nice talking to you all.

307
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,330
Thank you.
