00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:02,670
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:08,220
My name is Ra Gen, having 10 plus years
of experience in enterprise system

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,600
market architecture with the focus
on a driven workflow optimization

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,430
and robotic process automation.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,530
Currently, I serve as a senior
software engineer where I design

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:25,020
and delivers scalable intelligent
workflow system that seamlessly

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,480
integrate real time decision making.

8
00:00:27,975 --> 00:00:32,115
Artificial inte and end-to-end automation.

9
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:37,485
My work is centered around solving
the complex business challenge and

10
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:40,155
enhancing the operational efficiency.

11
00:00:41,655 --> 00:00:45,915
Over the course of my career, I have
been fortunate to work with the leading

12
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:50,775
organizations in the healthcare,
banking, and finance and insurance

13
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:56,415
industry, driving the innovation and
the digital transformation at scale.

14
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:01,035
Today I'm going to present how
revolutionizing legacy system

15
00:01:01,035 --> 00:01:03,645
migration to cloud architecture.

16
00:01:04,724 --> 00:01:10,395
So the AI power zero touch integration,
revolutionizing legacy system

17
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:12,195
migration to cloud architecture.

18
00:01:12,525 --> 00:01:17,655
Welcome to the presentation on
the No approach to enterprise

19
00:01:17,655 --> 00:01:21,765
legacy system migration through
zero touch AI driven middleware.

20
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:22,755
This.

21
00:01:23,685 --> 00:01:29,955
Innovative solution autonomously
facilitate the integration of aging

22
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:32,925
enterprise infrastructure with
the modern cloud architecture.

23
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:40,750
Our approach leverage advanced mission
learning programs and algorithms,

24
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,995
natural language processing,
and the knowledge graphs Two.

25
00:01:47,745 --> 00:01:53,385
Automatically discover, map, and
optimize the legacy work environments

26
00:01:53,385 --> 00:01:56,115
through the manual intervention.

27
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,110
So let's understand the
legacy migration challenge.

28
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,229
Here are three legacy challenges
that we have identified.

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,210
Legacy system barrier, complex
integration, high cost and disruption.

30
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,750
Let's discuss legacy system barrier.

31
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,260
Despite the proven reliability
legacy system now significantly

32
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:25,019
impede the digital transformation
initiatives and diminish competitive.

33
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,360
Advantage in the today's rapidly
evolving business environment.

34
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,820
The second one, complex integration.

35
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,310
Integrating the legacy system with the
modern cloud architecture extend far

36
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:45,690
beyond the technical hurdle, encompassing
the critical organizational financial

37
00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:52,890
and operational challenge that demand the
comprehensive solutions, high cost, and,

38
00:02:52,940 --> 00:03:00,800
disruption organizations encounter high
migration costs, increasing technical

39
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,200
debate due to insufficient integration
strategies and considerable business

40
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:15,620
disruption during the transition, creating
significant obstacles to modernization.

41
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,770
So zero touch AI driven integration.

42
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,170
Define, here are four things.

43
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,260
Autonomous orchestration,
AI port analysis, automated

44
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,230
transformation, continuous validation.

45
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,730
Let's go one by one.

46
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,500
Autonomous orchestration.

47
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,140
Complete migration without
a human interaction.

48
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,590
AI port analysis, intelligence,
discovery, and map mapping.

49
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,785
Automated transformation, self-optimizing
conversion pattern, continuous

50
00:03:45,785 --> 00:03:48,845
validation, self-healing, integration.

51
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,490
Mechanism, zero touch driven
integration leverages artificial

52
00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:02,840
inte to autonomously orchestrate the
entire migration process from legacy

53
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,120
system to cloud native environment.

54
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:11,690
This approach builds upon zero touch
networking orchestration principles,

55
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,550
extending them to enterprise
architecture transformation.

56
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,020
So current state of.

57
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:23,315
Enterprise system migration,
traditional approach.

58
00:04:23,615 --> 00:04:28,625
Current migration methods typically
follow one of three established

59
00:04:29,195 --> 00:04:36,155
approaches, lift and shift, relocating
the application without modification,

60
00:04:36,755 --> 00:04:43,450
re-platforming, making target modification
to leverage specific cloud capabilities.

61
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,290
Refactoring.

62
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:52,880
Substantial code restructuring
to fully adapt cloud native

63
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,130
principles, key limitations.

64
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,530
Manual integration
methods dominate despite

65
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,025
inherent limitations.

66
00:05:05,715 --> 00:05:12,620
Reliance on rare specialist
with expertise in both the

67
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,870
legacy and target technologies.

68
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:25,565
N dependencies on often outdated
or absent documentation.

69
00:05:26,345 --> 00:05:31,175
Significant potential are human
error during transition process,

70
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:38,165
sequential nature, limiting
paralyzation opportunities.

71
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,210
The pinpoints of current
migration process.

72
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,970
Here are the four pinpoints
that we have identified.

73
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:52,940
The one is reduction in the legacy
knowledge, incomplete system discovery

74
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,090
data quality issue testing complexity.

75
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:03,320
Let's discuss one by one reduction in
the legacy knowledge original system

76
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,410
architects and developers retired or.

77
00:06:07,475 --> 00:06:13,595
Transition to other roles, taking the
crucial undocumented knowledge with them.

78
00:06:14,285 --> 00:06:18,215
Creating the fundamental challenge
in understanding the system behavior.

79
00:06:18,755 --> 00:06:25,415
Incomplete system discovery, dependencies
and integration often emerge only

80
00:06:25,415 --> 00:06:28,055
during the migration causing the scope.

81
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:35,315
Expansion and timelines delay
as teams encounter unexpected.

82
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:41,840
Connection between the system, data
quality issues, data quality and

83
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:49,640
consistency problem often come up during
the migration needing a lot of cleaning

84
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,480
work that was not planned for initially.

85
00:06:54,190 --> 00:07:02,195
Let's discuss test testing capabilities,
validation complexity increases.

86
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:03,535
Expansion.

87
00:07:04,165 --> 00:07:07,795
Expansion only with system size
and integration scope, making

88
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:13,855
comprehensive testing nearly
impossible through manual means alone.

89
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,545
Critical framework for
aid driven integration.

90
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:23,635
Precision layer, intelligence layer,
orchestration layer, execution layer,

91
00:07:23,695 --> 00:07:25,945
governance layer, optimization layer.

92
00:07:26,335 --> 00:07:27,745
Let's discuss one by one.

93
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,185
So perception layer.

94
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:36,445
Monitors legacy system behavior
through non-invasive methods.

95
00:07:36,865 --> 00:07:40,405
And the next one, intelligence
layer builds comprehensive

96
00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:43,255
model of system functionality.

97
00:07:43,975 --> 00:07:47,065
Orchestration layer
coordinate transformation

98
00:07:47,725 --> 00:07:50,035
activities across components.

99
00:07:50,215 --> 00:07:55,945
Next one, execution layer implements
migration tasks through centralized

100
00:07:56,665 --> 00:07:59,965
and APIs governance layer.

101
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:06,745
Compliance with organizational
policy optimization layer

102
00:08:06,805 --> 00:08:11,155
continuously refine the system
performance and resource allocation.

103
00:08:12,175 --> 00:08:17,155
This multi-layered architecture
enables autonomously migration from

104
00:08:17,155 --> 00:08:23,990
legacy system to cloud environment,
drawing inspiration from advance

105
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,710
in network automation and service.

106
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:33,895
Management, the Keya Touch
technologies, enabling integration.

107
00:08:35,065 --> 00:08:37,765
There are five things
that we have identified.

108
00:08:37,765 --> 00:08:42,865
Natural language processing and
symbol methods, machine learning,

109
00:08:43,345 --> 00:08:45,685
knowledge graphs, computer revision.

110
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:47,425
Rest discussed one by one.

111
00:08:48,115 --> 00:08:53,785
Natural language processing extracts
the domain knowledge from unstructured

112
00:08:53,785 --> 00:08:56,215
documentation code component, and.

113
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,910
User manuals

114
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:05,140
and simple methods combines
multiple yay approaches to

115
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,510
enhance the migration robustness.

116
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:14,860
Machine learning identifies pattern
and system behavior without explicit

117
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:21,970
programming knowledge provides
semantic representation of system

118
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,560
components and relationship.

119
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:24,730
Computer revision.

120
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:31,605
Analyze elements to map the user
interaction in systems, lacking a

121
00:09:31,645 --> 00:09:37,150
PA access, so pro to methodology
for autonomous migration.

122
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,000
Here are the four stages
that we have identified.

123
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:45,820
One is S system analysis, workflow
discovery, code, transformation,

124
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,280
continuous validation.

125
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,895
Let's discuss one by one system analysis.

126
00:09:51,535 --> 00:09:54,145
Non-invasive collection approach.

127
00:09:54,715 --> 00:10:00,355
Monitor legacy system without disruption,
creating a comprehensive inventory of

128
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:04,315
components, interaction and dependencies.

129
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,855
The next one, workflow discovery process.

130
00:10:07,855 --> 00:10:14,005
Mining algorithms, analyze event
log to reconstruct actual business

131
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:17,670
process revealing shadow workflow, and.

132
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,080
Exception handling pattern.

133
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,200
Third one, core transformation.

134
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:28,210
Automated tools transform the legacy
code into modern programming languages

135
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:35,680
while preserving the functional
semantic and generating equivalent.

136
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,739
A PS the last one, continuous validation.

137
00:10:39,729 --> 00:10:40,449
Digital.

138
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,530
Simulation enables verification of
migration plans before implementation

139
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:54,160
with automated testing comparison
response between the legacy and migrated

140
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,759
components implementation case status.

141
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:04,149
Let's go Each industry wise if you look at
the financial industry, legacy environment

142
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:07,209
is for many financial industry.

143
00:11:08,109 --> 00:11:10,329
Mainframe COBOL application.

144
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:14,379
Target architecture,
microservice architecture.

145
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:20,889
Key challenges, transition,
integrity, regulatory compliance.

146
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:23,499
Let's look at the manufacturing industry.

147
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:29,019
The key challenge, legacy, environment
firm manufacturing industry is customized

148
00:11:29,109 --> 00:11:34,689
on Prime ERP targeted architecture cloud.

149
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:35,109
Now.

150
00:11:35,934 --> 00:11:38,634
Native ERP with iot.

151
00:11:39,774 --> 00:11:43,884
Key challenges, complex
customization, real time requirements.

152
00:11:44,214 --> 00:11:46,224
Let's look at the healthcare industry.

153
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:53,454
Departmental patient system,
target architecture, unified cloud

154
00:11:53,454 --> 00:11:57,144
platform, key challenges, data
privacy, system fragmentation.

155
00:11:57,444 --> 00:11:58,854
Let's look at the telecom.

156
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:04,839
Industry network management system
is the legacy environment, the

157
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:11,589
targeted architecture cloud, native
orchestration, key challenge, hardware

158
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:13,569
dependencies, legacy protocol.

159
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:21,579
These diverse case study demonstrate
that efficiency of touch, AI

160
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:23,919
driven migration approach across.

161
00:12:25,194 --> 00:12:30,744
Different sectors with each
implementation showing significantly

162
00:12:31,404 --> 00:12:37,284
improvements in migration,
timelines, resource utilization,

163
00:12:37,344 --> 00:12:39,864
and post-migration performance.

164
00:12:40,884 --> 00:12:43,704
Key challenges and feature
research directions.

165
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:50,094
So here are the tech
technical limitations, highly

166
00:12:50,094 --> 00:12:51,924
customized legacy system with.

167
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:01,524
Property technologies often resist
standardized analysis approach.

168
00:13:01,524 --> 00:13:09,054
System with hardware dependencies
are non-deterministic behavior.

169
00:13:09,384 --> 00:13:10,794
Present sustainable migration challenge,

170
00:13:11,794 --> 00:13:18,189
security and compliance legacy system
often implement security through.

171
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:22,479
Security rather than
modern principle regulatory

172
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:31,029
requirements impose strict
constructions on migration approach,

173
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:36,849
particularly regarding the data
residency and access control.

174
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:42,519
Human, a collaboration complex
scenarios often emerge that suppress

175
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:44,964
the current a capabilities requiring.

176
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:51,399
Effective human AI collaboration
model with balance the advantage

177
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:57,849
of automation with human experts
to achieve optimal results.

178
