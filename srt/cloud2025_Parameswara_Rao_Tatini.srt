00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:09,100
It is a pleasure to, be here today to
discuss how a transforming procurement

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,709
and supply chains procurement is no
longer just about sourcing supplies.

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,320
And managing contracts.

7
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:23,080
it has evolved into a strategic
function that drives efficiency, cost

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,050
savings, and risk management here is
playing a major role in automating,

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:34,930
processes, analyzing data at scale
and improving decision making.

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,100
The goal of this.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,385
How AI improves efficiency and cost
optimization in procurement, real world AI

12
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:47,790
applications, supplier selection, contract
management, and demand forecasting.

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,720
These are the real world applications,
challenges, companies face in AI

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,210
adoption and how to navigate them and
the future of air power procurement

00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,519
and next steps for businesses.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
By end of this talk, you understand.

17
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:10,215
Why AI is not just an option, it is a
necessity for procurement teams looking.

18
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:11,730
Stay ahead.

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,040
procurement has traditionally
been manual, slow, and reactive.

20
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,820
AI is changing that by
making a procurement faster,

21
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,580
more s and cost effective.

22
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:26,204
let us see what efficiency gains we get.

23
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:30,005
AI powered automation is
eliminating repetitive.

24
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:36,494
Time consuming tasks from purchase order
processing to supplier evaluations.

25
00:01:36,865 --> 00:01:41,034
studies show that AI can reduce
procurement processing times

26
00:01:41,365 --> 00:01:47,295
by 37%, allowing teams to focus
on high value decision making.

27
00:01:47,795 --> 00:01:48,634
Cost savings.

28
00:01:49,185 --> 00:01:54,165
procurement is not just about
spending, it is about spending wisely.

29
00:01:54,735 --> 00:01:55,785
AI power spend.

30
00:01:55,785 --> 00:02:01,124
Analytics help businesses identify
hidden efficiencies, inefficiencies,

31
00:02:01,405 --> 00:02:07,344
negotiate, Better contracts and
optimized costs, leading to year 15 to

32
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:11,214
20% reductions in procurement expenses.

33
00:02:11,695 --> 00:02:18,505
In short, AI's shifting procurement from
operational function to a value driver.

34
00:02:19,004 --> 00:02:23,444
in the real world Impact, let us see
how AA is, impacting the real world.

35
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:28,095
traditionally, supplier selection was
based on a relationships, historical

36
00:02:28,095 --> 00:02:30,795
performance and manual research.

37
00:02:31,065 --> 00:02:31,334
Yay.

38
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:34,695
Enhance, enhances this by analyzing.

39
00:02:35,194 --> 00:02:38,314
Market trends and historical performance.

40
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:44,344
AI powered supplier selection
has increased accuracy by 42%,

41
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:49,714
helping procurement teams reduce
risks and negotiate better deals.

42
00:02:50,214 --> 00:02:53,454
when it comes to contracts
management, procurement teams

43
00:02:53,454 --> 00:02:58,704
handle hundreds of contracts making
manual contract review a bottleneck.

44
00:02:59,154 --> 00:03:04,704
AI solves this by automating contract
review and highlighting the risk areas

45
00:03:04,764 --> 00:03:11,119
in the contract, reducing the processing
time by 60% through AI powered analysis.

46
00:03:11,619 --> 00:03:17,499
Enduring compliance and faster approvals
leading to shorter procurement cycles.

47
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:20,589
and now let's look into
demand forecasting.

48
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:27,699
Poor demand forecasting leads to,
lower purchasing are stockouts, yet

49
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:32,519
even forecasting models, analyze,
sale, trends, supplier performance.

50
00:03:32,774 --> 00:03:39,314
And external factors will
increase accuracy from 70% to 95%.

51
00:03:39,824 --> 00:03:44,564
These enables procurement teams
to reduce excessive inventory,

52
00:03:44,864 --> 00:03:48,659
improve supplier coordination,
and minimize procurement delays.

53
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:52,249
Now let us look at the
challenges, in AI implementation.

54
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:54,379
Mostly like a data privacy.

55
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,659
Here I relies on massive amount
of procurement data, which raises,

56
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:00,899
security and compliance risks.

57
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:08,869
So organizations must ensure, regulatory
compliances like G-D-P-R-C-C-P-A-E-T-C,

58
00:04:09,179 --> 00:04:10,889
also protect supplier.

59
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,779
And financial data from cyber threats,
build trust with the stakeholders by

60
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:19,419
implementing transparent AI models.

61
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:24,649
78% of the organizations
site, data security concerns

62
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:27,049
as a barrier to AI adaption.

63
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:32,479
Addressing these issues is a critical
for successful AI implementation,

64
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:34,999
legacy system integration.

65
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:40,819
most companies use waler ERP procurement
systems, AI integration requirements,

66
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:45,719
middleware solution to connect the
world and new systems phased adoption

67
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:50,759
plans to summarize, disruptions
flexible architecture to enable AI

68
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,229
driven procurement with 65 Center of
Enterprises are struggling with AI

69
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,749
integration work on these challenges.

70
00:04:58,274 --> 00:05:02,834
Overcoming these challenges is a
key, mostly with, they can overcome

71
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:06,224
by going on instead of, rollout.

72
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:12,834
Now let us see how ai, I, powers the
contracts, like the smart contracts.

73
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:18,964
one of the most exciting innovation in
procurement is AI powered smart contracts.

74
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:23,944
These contracts use, black could use
blackchain and AI driven validations

75
00:05:24,304 --> 00:05:26,224
to automate, contract execution.

76
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:29,009
why do smart contractors matter?

77
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:34,759
like for a fraud prevention, AI detects
irregularities and, prevents manipulation.

78
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,689
smart contracts automatically
enforce, terms and ensure that,

79
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:43,889
company policies, these contracts
are adhere to the company's policies.

80
00:05:44,489 --> 00:05:49,619
and also the faster processing here
reduces contract validation time by 85%.

81
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:54,349
Teams to focus on
negotiations and sourcing

82
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:55,989
bottleneck, and.

83
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:02,209
Now let us see how AI helps in
manufacturing, AI manufacturing

84
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:06,379
procurement by predicting
maintenance needs and avoiding

85
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:07,789
supply chain disruptions.

86
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:12,139
Optimizing production plan
with AI driven demand analysis.

87
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,119
And to reduce the delay delays, automating
supplier coordination, we can use the.

88
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:21,869
In the retail sector, the
procurement faces inventory

89
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:24,059
management and demand challenges.

90
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:29,489
Here it can help here by enhancing demand
forecast for, better, stock control.

91
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:34,039
Automating inventory replenishments
based on the real time data,

92
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:36,749
personalizing supplier strategies to.

93
00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:43,039
and now let us see how the, AI in
procurement can help technology

94
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,629
companies, in this, tech industry.

95
00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:50,939
AI streamlines, the vendor selection,
optimizing it, procurement, helping

96
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:55,939
businesses to automate, contract
analysis for software and cloud services.

97
00:06:56,299 --> 00:07:00,109
Analyze, complex service
segments to optimize, spending.

98
00:07:00,609 --> 00:07:04,869
Now, let's see how AI
helps in, sustainability.

99
00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:10,239
AI helps organizations reduce this
carbon footprint by optimizing supply

100
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:15,169
selection for sustainability, reducing
waste through predictive analytics,

101
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:21,289
minimizing logistics emissions,
leading to a 28% reduction in carbon.

102
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:26,019
Now in the risk mitigation, AI
powered early warning systems.

103
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:31,399
Like the risk management softwares detect,
supply chain risks with 85% accuracy.

104
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:36,049
This helps businesses proactively
mitigate risks before disruptions

105
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:41,949
occur, and hence supplier reli,
reliances and maintain, operations.

106
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:47,989
Now the AI driving strategies for
procurement, like beyond automation, AI

107
00:07:47,989 --> 00:07:53,174
is transforming strategic procurement in
three key ways, data driven decisions.

108
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:57,934
Here turns the raw procurement
data into actionable insights.

109
00:07:58,204 --> 00:08:02,484
Enable better forecasting and
supplier selection, and in

110
00:08:02,484 --> 00:08:04,254
supplier relationship management.

111
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:09,504
Yeah, answers suppliers, tracking
predictor risk assessments

112
00:08:09,774 --> 00:08:11,719
and engagement strategies.

113
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:16,689
S sourcing, yeah, helps in
procurement teams to optimize

114
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:20,949
strategies, reduce costs, and
improve supply chain resilience.

115
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:27,719
With procurement with ai, the procurement
is no longer just about transactions.

116
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:33,269
It is about strategy, intelligence,
and long term value creation.

117
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:38,274
In the future of AI power procurement,
AI adaption will continue to

118
00:08:38,274 --> 00:08:43,704
expand, but businesses must focus
on maximizing the cost savings.

119
00:08:44,034 --> 00:08:50,284
AI driven procurement saves, 3.58 millions
annually for small and medium enterprises.

120
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:52,529
Enhancing data security.

121
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:56,639
78% of businesses demand
stronger AI governance.

122
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:01,269
65% of enterprises struggle
with adoption, requiring,

123
00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:03,029
structured implementation plans.

124
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:07,409
Instead of just buying the off the
shelf software under straightaway

125
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:11,379
using it, they should have,
structured, implementation plans

126
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:11,939
now.

127
00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:16,684
To summarize what we had discussed
so far, like AI is optimizing

128
00:09:16,864 --> 00:09:21,544
optimizes procurement with
efficiency, cost reduction, and

129
00:09:21,754 --> 00:09:26,764
importantly risk management, AI
powered supplier selections, contract

130
00:09:26,764 --> 00:09:28,924
automation, and forecasting Our.

131
00:09:29,424 --> 00:09:30,864
Game changer actually.

132
00:09:31,524 --> 00:09:31,794
Yeah.

133
00:09:31,824 --> 00:09:36,894
Overcoming challenges like data privacy
and system integration is crucial.

134
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:42,174
We also discussed about AI driven
smart contracts and predictive

135
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:48,654
analytics will define the future of the
procurement companies that adopt ai.

136
00:09:48,894 --> 00:09:52,464
Now we'll lead the next era
for strategy procurement.

137
00:09:52,964 --> 00:09:55,094
