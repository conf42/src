00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,350
Today, I am excited to talk
about mastering real time

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,880
personalization, innovations,
and neural ranking architectures.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,989
In this session, we are going to explore
how new breakthroughs in neural ranking

8
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:26,689
are changing the game for real time
personalization, especially in e commerce.

9
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,820
We will cover everything from
embedding based indexing.

10
00:00:30,035 --> 00:00:35,085
to attention driven models and see how
these strategies improve accuracy, reduce

11
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:37,324
latency and boost conversion rates.

12
00:00:38,135 --> 00:00:42,814
Let us jump in and look at how these tools
can help us create better user experiences

13
00:00:43,195 --> 00:00:45,275
and achieve stronger business results.

14
00:00:45,775 --> 00:00:49,905
In this presentation, we will start by
understanding the challenges in real

15
00:00:49,965 --> 00:00:54,405
time personalization, identifying the
complexities that need to be addressed.

16
00:00:55,225 --> 00:00:59,225
Next, we'll focus on enhancing
accuracy, diving into strategies

17
00:00:59,235 --> 00:01:02,915
that ensure recommendations
align perfectly with user intent.

18
00:01:03,514 --> 00:01:05,495
We will then look at reducing latency.

19
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,729
where scalable solutions enable
faster and more responsive systems.

20
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,910
After that, we will explore how
these efforts contribute to boosting

21
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:17,919
conversions, turning personalization
into tangible business results,

22
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:22,030
and finally, we will wrap up with
conclusions summarizing the critical

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,100
takeaways and actionable insights.

24
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,599
Let's get started.

25
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:30,439
Let us take a look at the challenges that
many e commerce businesses face when it

26
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,269
comes to a real time personalization.

27
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,739
First, there is high latency, which
slows down the user experience.

28
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:40,834
In online shopping, Users
expect fast responses.

29
00:01:41,284 --> 00:01:44,574
If the system takes too long to
give recommendations, it disrupts

30
00:01:44,594 --> 00:01:46,014
their shopping experience.

31
00:01:46,554 --> 00:01:50,644
This delay can frustrate customers and
cause them to leave the site, which

32
00:01:50,664 --> 00:01:52,444
affects both engagement and sales.

33
00:01:52,944 --> 00:01:55,684
Second, inaccurate
recommendations are a big issue.

34
00:01:56,294 --> 00:01:58,674
Personalization works
best when it's accurate.

35
00:01:59,164 --> 00:02:03,224
If the suggestions aren't right, users
may stop trusting the platform and feel

36
00:02:03,234 --> 00:02:04,129
like it doesn't answer their needs.

37
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:05,079
needs.

38
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:09,209
Third, poor personalization
leads to lower conversion rates.

39
00:02:09,809 --> 00:02:12,709
If recommendations are not
aligned with what the user likes

40
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:14,989
or wants, it means missed sales.

41
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:18,429
Personalizing experiences is
key to driving conversions

42
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:19,969
and building customer loyalty.

43
00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:25,329
Without it, businesses could see fewer
repeat customers and lower satisfaction.

44
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:28,379
Lastly, Businesses need
solutions that can scale.

45
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,509
As they grow, the amount
of data increases.

46
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:35,079
Personalization systems need
to handle this data efficiently

47
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:37,229
without losing speed or accuracy.

48
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:41,419
This means building strong systems
that can work with large data sets

49
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:43,509
while still being quick and responsive.

50
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:48,319
Addressing these issues is crucial
for any e commerce platform that

51
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,139
wants to improve its personalization.

52
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:55,639
By reducing delays, Improving accuracy,
increasing conversion rates, and

53
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:58,789
scaling effectively, businesses
can create better experiences

54
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:00,259
for customers and drive growth.

55
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:04,949
We will dive into some strategies
and innovations that tackle these

56
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,079
challenges and help businesses
master real time personalization.

57
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:12,599
Let us look at three advanced
strategies to improve accuracy

58
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,179
in real time personalization.

59
00:03:14,619 --> 00:03:18,949
First, multi tower architecture splits
the retrieval and ranking process into two

60
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:21,139
parts, making the system more scalable.

61
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:25,079
Tower 1 handles retrieval,
narrowing down a large pool of

62
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:26,849
options based on general relevance.

63
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:31,399
Tower 2 then refines these options by
ranking them based on user preferences

64
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:33,259
and other contextual signals.

65
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:38,704
For example, Tower 1 might pull up 100
products, and Tower 2 ranks them based

66
00:03:38,704 --> 00:03:42,734
on things like the user's browsing
history, making the recommendations

67
00:03:42,734 --> 00:03:44,284
more personalized and accurate.

68
00:03:45,004 --> 00:03:49,004
Next, semantic search goes beyond
just keyword matching by using

69
00:03:49,044 --> 00:03:52,664
embeddings and vector similarity to
better understand the user's intent.

70
00:03:53,364 --> 00:03:56,844
This helps the system find deeper
connections between what the user

71
00:03:56,844 --> 00:03:59,514
searches for and the items available.

72
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:04,454
For example, If someone searches for
comfortable office chairs, the system

73
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:08,534
can recommend ergonomic chairs or
those with memory form, even if the

74
00:04:08,534 --> 00:04:10,444
exact words are not a perfect match.

75
00:04:10,964 --> 00:04:13,374
This helps users find
exactly what they need.

76
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:19,104
Lastly, transformer based models like
BERT or T5 are great for understanding

77
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,124
complex queries and product descriptions.

78
00:04:21,624 --> 00:04:25,624
These models analyze multi layered
questions, making sure that search

79
00:04:25,634 --> 00:04:26,954
results are highly relevant.

80
00:04:27,564 --> 00:04:31,464
For instance, if someone searches for
budget friendly laptops with good battery

81
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:35,464
life, These models can suggest the
most suitable options by understanding

82
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:36,844
the full context of the query.

83
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:41,704
In the next slides, we will dive deeper
into semantic search and transformer based

84
00:04:41,704 --> 00:04:46,994
models and see how they can help improve
accuracy and boost user satisfaction.

85
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:51,754
Let's talk about how semantic search
boosts personalization by focusing on

86
00:04:51,784 --> 00:04:54,164
context, relevance, and scalability.

87
00:04:54,824 --> 00:04:59,494
First, contextual understanding helps
move beyond just keyword matching.

88
00:04:59,854 --> 00:05:03,444
Semantic search uses word embeddings
to understand the deeper meanings

89
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,204
behind what users are searching for.

90
00:05:05,694 --> 00:05:09,874
For example, if someone searches for
affordable running shoes, the system can

91
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:13,494
recognize the words like budget friendly
and economical means the same things.

92
00:05:14,034 --> 00:05:17,674
So it can show up products that
match the user's intent, even if

93
00:05:17,674 --> 00:05:19,184
the exact words don't line up.

94
00:05:19,664 --> 00:05:21,234
Next, improved relevance.

95
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:23,829
is a big advantage to a semantic search.

96
00:05:24,179 --> 00:05:28,079
By considering things like user intent
and context, the system can provide

97
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,929
more accurate personalized results.

98
00:05:30,499 --> 00:05:34,839
For example, if a user has recently
checked out fitness trackers, a search

99
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:37,889
for running gear might show shoes
that work well with those trackers.

100
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:41,519
This way, the recommendations feel
more in tune with the user's need,

101
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,169
making their experience better.

102
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:47,319
Finally, scalability and
flexibility makes semantic search

103
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,999
a great fit for large systems.

104
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:52,719
It works well with models like
multi tower architectures with the

105
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:56,759
first tower retrieves broad matches,
and the second defines them based

106
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,529
on semantic meaning and context.

107
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:02,749
This setup lets the system manage
huge catalogs while still keeping

108
00:06:02,749 --> 00:06:06,949
recommendations accurate and
relevant even as the dataset grows.

109
00:06:07,794 --> 00:06:11,304
By combining these strengths,
Semantic Search doesn't just improve

110
00:06:11,334 --> 00:06:15,584
accuracy, it adapts to user in real
time, making it a must have for

111
00:06:15,654 --> 00:06:17,374
modern personalization systems.

112
00:06:17,874 --> 00:06:22,354
Let's explore what makes transformer
based models so powerful, focusing

113
00:06:22,354 --> 00:06:25,124
on their ability to understand
context and scale efficiently.

114
00:06:25,824 --> 00:06:28,814
First, enhanced contextual understanding.

115
00:06:29,814 --> 00:06:33,844
Transformers are great at picking up
the subtle relationships and data thanks

116
00:06:33,844 --> 00:06:35,324
to their self attention mechanism.

117
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,239
Unlike older models, transformer look
up every part of a query or input in

118
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:44,209
relation to all the other parts, giving
them a deep understanding of context.

119
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:48,799
For example, in a search for affordable
noise cancelling headphones, the

120
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:52,849
transformer knows that affordable
applies to headphones and that noise

121
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:54,619
cancelling adds a specific feature.

122
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:59,009
This level of detail helps them
rank results with amazing accuracy.

123
00:06:59,489 --> 00:07:01,419
Second, real time personalization.

124
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:05,179
Transformers can quickly adapt and
fine tune their recommendations

125
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:06,359
based on new information.

126
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:11,109
They bring in pre trained knowledge and
adjust to user behavior in real time.

127
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,699
For instance, if a user switches
from looking at fitness gear to home

128
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:19,639
gym equipment, the transformer can
update its suggestions right away.

129
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:21,289
And fitness

130
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:24,459
gear can be used to
show relevant searches.

131
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:26,219
Third, scalability.

132
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:29,869
New transformer models like
this deliberate are designed

133
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:32,869
to be more efficient, reducing
the computational load.

134
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:37,309
Techniques like model pruning
and quantization help speed up

135
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:40,899
processing, which makes it easier
to handle millions of queries

136
00:07:40,929 --> 00:07:42,749
without sacrificing performance.

137
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:45,659
This means transformers
can deliver fast, scalable

138
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:46,809
personalization, even in real life.

139
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:51,069
What really sets transformers apart is
their self attention mechanism, which

140
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:54,369
lets them understand the big picture
by capturing global relationships

141
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:58,039
and data, and their ability to
handle inputs of different lengths.

142
00:07:58,559 --> 00:08:01,599
These features make transformers
ideal for solving complex

143
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,359
personalization challenges at scale.

144
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:06,819
In this part, we will
cover four key strategies.

145
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:09,979
To improve the performance of
real time personalization systems

146
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:11,959
with some practical examples.

147
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:15,259
First, vector databases
for fast retrieval.

148
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:19,549
Vector databases like Pinecone are
great for quickly searching through data

149
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:21,509
using approximate nearest neighbors.

150
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:25,549
This means when a user searches for
something like running shoes, The system

151
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:29,959
can quickly match the result with product
data, ensuring fast and accurate results.

152
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:34,069
Model optimization techniques
help make models smaller and

153
00:08:34,069 --> 00:08:36,169
faster without losing accuracy.

154
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,779
Methods like quantization,
pruning, and knowledge distillation

155
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,409
make the models more efficient.

156
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:45,719
For example, a recommendation engine
that's optimized using quantization

157
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:49,959
can make faster predictions even on
mobile devices with limited resources.

158
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:54,439
Caching strategies improve performance
for data that gets accessed a lot,

159
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:57,359
like user profiles or popular items.

160
00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:01,719
By caching this data and using edge
computing, recommendations can be

161
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:05,489
delivered from servers closer to the
user, cutting down response time.

162
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:10,459
For example, during a flash sale, caching
ensures that users in different regions

163
00:09:10,469 --> 00:09:16,149
get fast updates on trending deals,
giving them data and keeping them engaged.

164
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:20,769
Lastly, batch processing for
inference groups multiple queries

165
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:25,609
together to optimize resources,
especially when using GPUs or TPUs.

166
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:29,559
This is useful during busy times
when there are a lot of queries

167
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:33,829
as it reduces the processing load
and helps keep response times low.

168
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:37,029
I'll go into more detail on
vector databases and caching

169
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,459
strategies in the next slide.

170
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,909
Let's take a closer look at how vector
databases drive real time personalization

171
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:44,109
with speed and scalability.

172
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:48,879
First, efficient similarity search
helps the system quickly find items

173
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,689
that are similar to a user's search.

174
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:55,069
For example, if someone searches
for ergonomic chairs, the system

175
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:58,329
can quickly match them with products
that have key features like lumbar

176
00:09:58,329 --> 00:09:59,849
support or adjustable height.

177
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:02,637
Next, scalability with advanced
indexing ensures that searches stay

178
00:10:02,637 --> 00:10:03,784
fast, and the system can quickly find
items that have key features like

179
00:10:03,784 --> 00:10:04,225
lumbar support or adjustable height.

180
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:05,519
Next, scalability with advanced indexing
ensures that searches stay fast,

181
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,949
and the system Even with millions of
items in the database techniques like

182
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:13,999
hierarchical navigable small world
helps the system manage large amounts

183
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:18,439
of data efficiently so it can provide
quick results even during busy times

184
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:22,469
like sales integration with the ranking
models make the systems even better.

185
00:10:23,054 --> 00:10:26,904
After the system retrieves similar
items, ranking models fine tune

186
00:10:26,904 --> 00:10:29,724
the recommendations based on
things like a user's preference or

187
00:10:29,764 --> 00:10:33,704
purchase history, making the results
more personalized and accurate.

188
00:10:34,214 --> 00:10:38,234
Finally, cost effective deployment
ensures that these databases are

189
00:10:38,234 --> 00:10:41,944
optimized for performance without
wasting resources, whether they

190
00:10:41,944 --> 00:10:43,054
are in the cloud or on premise.

191
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:47,529
They balance speed and cost,
making it possible to deliver real

192
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,449
time personalization at scale.

193
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:54,389
All these features make vector databases
crucial for providing fast, accurate,

194
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:59,369
and adaptive recommendations that help
businesses deliver impactful results.

195
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:04,809
Let's look at how caching strategies
can boost performance and scalability.

196
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,899
First, reduce repeated computations
by caching data that's accessed

197
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:13,009
often like embeddings, user
profiles, or query results.

198
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:18,069
For example, in a product recommendation
system, popular items are often queried.

199
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:21,919
By caching these results, the
system avoids recalculating

200
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:25,899
them each time, cutting down on
latency and improving efficiency.

201
00:11:26,624 --> 00:11:31,974
Next, dynamic cache updates ensures the
cached data stays accurate and up to date.

202
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:36,494
With smart invalidation and refresh
policies, the system can quickly update

203
00:11:36,524 --> 00:11:40,954
information, like trending products during
a flash sale, so that recommendations

204
00:11:40,964 --> 00:11:42,754
always reflect the latest data.

205
00:11:43,754 --> 00:11:47,454
The layered caching approach
takes this further by using

206
00:11:47,454 --> 00:11:48,684
multiple layers of caching.

207
00:11:49,164 --> 00:11:54,864
For example, in memory databases
provide super fast data retrieval.

208
00:11:55,074 --> 00:11:59,334
Message queues help manage data flow
and distributed caching solutions

209
00:11:59,354 --> 00:12:00,924
allow large scale data sharing.

210
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:05,044
This setup ensures that The
system performs well across

211
00:12:05,064 --> 00:12:06,374
all parts of architecture.

212
00:12:07,134 --> 00:12:11,674
Finally, scalable caching solutions are
key for handling high query volumes.

213
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:16,214
Tools that are optimized for scalability
can handle millions of requests,

214
00:12:16,374 --> 00:12:19,974
ensuring that the system stays reliable
even during peak traffic times.

215
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:25,859
For instance, during a big sale,
scalable caching ensures personalized

216
00:12:25,859 --> 00:12:28,579
recommendations are served
instantly to millions of users.

217
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:32,879
By using these caching strategies,
real time systems can cut down on

218
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:37,929
latency, scale efficiently, and
keep personalization recommendations

219
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:39,579
accurate and up to date.

220
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,479
In this slide, we are going to
look at four key strategies.

221
00:12:43,774 --> 00:12:45,564
That boost user engagement.

222
00:12:45,944 --> 00:12:48,114
Let us break each one down with examples.

223
00:12:48,714 --> 00:12:53,054
First, behavioral embeddings capture
user actions like clicks, purchase

224
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:54,654
history, and browsing patterns.

225
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,444
These embeddings help the system
understand user preferences and

226
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,144
predict what they might want next.

227
00:13:00,734 --> 00:13:05,084
For example, if a user Often
looks at sports gear, the

228
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,254
recommendations will focus on
related products like gym equipment,

229
00:13:08,274 --> 00:13:09,834
protein shakes, or running shoes.

230
00:13:10,334 --> 00:13:15,714
Next, neural networks enhance catalog data
by adding helpful tags, descriptions, and

231
00:13:15,714 --> 00:13:19,014
keywords, making products easier to find.

232
00:13:19,504 --> 00:13:24,084
For instance, a fashion retailer
Tag a plain white shirt as summer

233
00:13:24,124 --> 00:13:27,894
wear, formal attire, or office
essential based on its features.

234
00:13:28,364 --> 00:13:33,064
Similarly, a grocery store could label
items with tags like organic, low sodium,

235
00:13:33,074 --> 00:13:37,424
or family pack, helping users find
products that match their preference.

236
00:13:37,924 --> 00:13:42,764
Hybrid text based and semantic
retrieval combines traditional keyword

237
00:13:42,914 --> 00:13:44,704
search with power of semantic search.

238
00:13:45,254 --> 00:13:49,294
While keyword search look for exact
matches, semantic search understands

239
00:13:49,324 --> 00:13:50,634
the meaning behind queries.

240
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:56,024
For example, a search for energy efficient
refrigerators might not include size or

241
00:13:56,024 --> 00:14:00,354
features explicitly, but semantic search
will ensure that results show products

242
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:02,224
that are energy efficient and compact.

243
00:14:02,974 --> 00:14:06,904
This hybrid approach gives precise
and relevant results based on

244
00:14:06,904 --> 00:14:08,274
what the user really needs.

245
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:14,589
Finally, Dynamic feature pipelines with
streaming data use tools like Apache Kafka

246
00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:19,989
or Apache Flink to process user actions
in real time, such as clicks and views.

247
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:24,159
This helps update features like
trending items or recently viewed

248
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:29,239
products instantly, ensuring that the
system stays fresh and relevant, even

249
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,329
as user behavior changes frequently.

250
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,699
These four strategies are the
backbone of effective systems.

251
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:39,799
In the next slide, we will dive
deeper into behavioral embeddings

252
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,339
and dynamic feature pipelines.

253
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,869
Let us explore how embeddings based
strategies by using the examples

254
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:50,029
of a user who's interested in
fitness to keep things consistent.

255
00:14:50,609 --> 00:14:51,949
First, embedding generation.

256
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:56,724
When a user browses fitness related
products like sports gear or buys

257
00:14:56,764 --> 00:15:00,474
protein shakes, neural networks can
create high dimensional vectors or

258
00:15:00,474 --> 00:15:02,984
embeddings to represent their preferences.

259
00:15:02,984 --> 00:15:06,634
These embeddings capture the
user's fitness focused behavior,

260
00:15:06,964 --> 00:15:10,884
helping the system identify them as
someone into health and wellness.

261
00:15:11,864 --> 00:15:16,234
Second, real time adaptation
ensures embedding updates as

262
00:15:16,234 --> 00:15:17,454
the user's interests shift.

263
00:15:17,764 --> 00:15:22,069
For example, If the user starts browsing
running shoes and then switches to yoga

264
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:25,929
mats, the system adjusts the embedding
to reflect the new interest in yoga.

265
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:30,649
As a result, recommendations will now
focus on yoga related products like

266
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:32,709
resistance band or meditation cushions.

267
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:36,709
Intent prediction builds on this
by using embeddings to predict

268
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:38,059
what the user might need next.

269
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,179
Based on the browsing history of
running shoes and yoga mats, the system

270
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:45,929
might predict an interest in fitness
accessories such as water bottles,

271
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:49,669
activity trackers, and suggest these
as the next things to check out.

272
00:15:50,169 --> 00:15:53,569
Cross session learning ensures
that the system keeps track of the

273
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:55,459
user's preference across visits.

274
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:59,349
If the user comes back after a few
weeks and starts searching for home

275
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:03,759
workout gear, the system remembers their
fitness interest and recommends items

276
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:07,939
like dumbbells or assistance machines,
staying relevant even over time.

277
00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:13,414
Finally, Seamless integration with
vector databases like Pinecone helps.

278
00:16:13,814 --> 00:16:15,514
Quickly retrieve these embeddings.

279
00:16:16,044 --> 00:16:19,804
For instance, when the user searches for
training gear, the system matches their

280
00:16:19,804 --> 00:16:24,744
fitness related embeddings with relevant
product embeddings, suggesting items like

281
00:16:24,744 --> 00:16:29,164
durable training shoes or compact gym
equipment that fits their preference.

282
00:16:30,034 --> 00:16:34,044
These strategies can be used to Work
together to provide real time, adaptive,

283
00:16:34,104 --> 00:16:38,004
and consistent personalization,
making the users feel understood and

284
00:16:38,004 --> 00:16:40,254
engaged at every step of the way.

285
00:16:40,754 --> 00:16:45,454
In this section, we will look at how
dynamic feature pipelines enable real

286
00:16:45,454 --> 00:16:49,304
time personalization using a flash sale
as an example to show their impact.

287
00:16:50,224 --> 00:16:52,449
First, real time data
ingestion is important.

288
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:56,589
Captures user actions like clicks,
views, and purchases as they happen.

289
00:16:57,369 --> 00:17:01,799
Tools like Apache Kafka or AWS
Kinesis stream these events in real

290
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:05,589
time, ensuring that as users browse
and interact with products during

291
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,779
the flash sale, no data is missed.

292
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:12,349
Next, Feature Transformation
and Enrichment turns this raw

293
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:14,089
data into useful insights.

294
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:19,289
Tools like Apache Flink or Spark
Streaming processes the data by applying

295
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:23,479
transformations, like generating
embeddings or using time decay functions.

296
00:17:24,184 --> 00:17:28,634
For examples, products that have received
a lot of recent clicks or views during the

297
00:17:28,644 --> 00:17:32,924
sale are prioritized, so the hottest items
get more visibility in recommendations.

298
00:17:33,904 --> 00:17:38,584
Then, we have contextual feature
updates, which adjusts user preferences

299
00:17:38,614 --> 00:17:40,494
and product ranking in real time.

300
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:44,654
As users engage with the site,
features like session recency,

301
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:46,799
Our trending items are updated.

302
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:51,589
For example, if a product becomes super
popular during the flash sale, the

303
00:17:51,589 --> 00:17:55,649
system immediately reflects that in its
recommendations, ensuring that users are

304
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,629
always seeing the most relevant items.

305
00:17:58,129 --> 00:18:02,719
Finally, model integration for real time
predictions uses the updated data to

306
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:07,789
feed into deployed models like TensorFlow
Serving or Triton, which Generate

307
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:09,659
personalized recommendations on the fly.

308
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:13,719
This means the system can suggest
the best product for each user based

309
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:15,899
on their behavior during the sale.

310
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:20,769
Together, these components ensure that
the system stays adaptive, relevant,

311
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:25,549
and capable of handling high demand
solutions like flash sales while

312
00:18:25,699 --> 00:18:27,889
delivering personalized results to users.

313
00:18:28,389 --> 00:18:31,609
Let us quickly summarize the key
elements of a scalable system

314
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:33,029
for real time personalization.

315
00:18:33,629 --> 00:18:38,469
First, scalable data pipeline architecture
ensures that system can handle millions

316
00:18:38,469 --> 00:18:42,519
of user interactions like clicks,
views, and purchases in real time.

317
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:46,659
This is especially important during
high traffic events like flash sales,

318
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:50,609
where the system must remain fast and
responsive even during heavy load.

319
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:56,174
Next, Vector Database Integration enables
fast and accurate similarity searches.

320
00:18:56,774 --> 00:19:01,534
By matching user preferences with product
features, these databases help deliver

321
00:19:01,564 --> 00:19:03,404
relevant recommendations in real time.

322
00:19:03,904 --> 00:19:06,774
Dynamic Feature Engineering
is another piece.

323
00:19:07,264 --> 00:19:10,954
It allows the system to update
features such as session, recency,

324
00:19:10,954 --> 00:19:12,534
or trending items on the fly.

325
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:17,034
This ensures the system can adapt quickly
to real time changes in user behavior.

326
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:21,539
Finally, A B testing and monitoring
frameworks allow businesses

327
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:25,349
to continuously refine their
recommendations by testing different

328
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:28,629
strategies and tracking metrics
like latency and conversion rates.

329
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:33,619
The system can be regularly
optimized to improve user engagement.

330
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:38,989
Together, these components create
a powerful scalable framework that

331
00:19:38,989 --> 00:19:43,219
supports personalization at scale,
ensuring the system remains precise,

332
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,969
adaptive, and continuously improving.

333
00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:50,489
With all of this, we have the question
of why is it that we must innovate

334
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:51,809
to make our recommendations better?

335
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:56,519
Personalization has shifted from a
nice to have to a must have driven

336
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:58,309
by evolving user expectations.

337
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:02,469
Today's users want real time,
highly relevant experiences

338
