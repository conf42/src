1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,329
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:02,840
My name is Natalia.

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,870
I'm a product owner with a
passion for using technology

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,570
to solve real world problems.

5
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,630
Over the years, I've led innovative
projects such as building a

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,059
serum system for FinTech company,
and creating AI driven platform

7
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,090
for social media monitoring.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,509
One of the most impactful
projects I worked on was a social

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,500
media monitoring platform for
brand reputational management.

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,439
This project taught me how
AI can turn unstructured data

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,159
into actionable insights.

12
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:33,830
But today I want to explore
how we can take this further.

13
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:40,110
Imagine how using IoT devices, not just
to monitor behavior, But to actively

14
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,900
collect and analyze client feedback
in real time together, let's dive into

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,370
how Internet of Things and artificial
intelligence can bring the gap between

16
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,370
data collection and client understanding.

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,740
Here's what I'll cover in today's session.

18
00:00:54,265 --> 00:00:58,395
First, I'll share lessons from the
social media monitoring and analysis

19
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:03,855
project I worked on, where AI played a
pivotal role in transforming unstructured

20
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:06,145
data into actionable insights.

21
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:10,584
Next, we'll talk about the
challenges of collecting feedback

22
00:01:10,614 --> 00:01:14,525
using AI alone, what works, what
doesn't, and where the gaps are.

23
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:19,965
Then I will explain how Internet of
Things can enhance feedback systems

24
00:01:20,275 --> 00:01:25,004
by combining explicit feedback,
like verbal responses, and implicit

25
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:26,865
feedback, such as behavioral data.

26
00:01:27,194 --> 00:01:31,384
Finally, I will dive into practical
applications of Internet of Things

27
00:01:31,384 --> 00:01:35,615
and feedback collection, explore the
challenges and opportunities that come

28
00:01:35,615 --> 00:01:38,025
with it, and look ahead at future trends.

29
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:42,065
So let's take a closer look at the
key question, how can Internet of

30
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:43,865
Things redefine feedback collection?

31
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:47,780
Thank you Specifically, how can it
complement traditional methods like

32
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,470
surveys or interviews and address
the limitations of AI only solutions?

33
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:57,000
Let's begin with the major challenge
I faced when developing the AI powered

34
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,720
social media monitoring platform.

35
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,560
Traditional methods of gathering public
opinion like surveys or focus groups

36
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,410
are slow, expensive, and often lack the
scale needed to capture the full picture.

37
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:11,490
Social media offered us an alternative.

38
00:02:12,084 --> 00:02:17,565
A continuous stream of opinions, but
this game with its own set of challenges.

39
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,269
The data was massive,
fragmented, and unstructured.

40
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,620
Think about millions of tweets,
posts, and comments in various

41
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,530
languages, tones and contexts.

42
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,780
How do you make sense of
all of that in real time?

43
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,789
We were overwhelmed by the volume of data.

44
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,619
Social media doesn't stop.

45
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:38,055
It's constant, 24 7.

46
00:02:38,055 --> 00:02:42,190
AI struggles with nuances, especially
sarcasm or cultural differences.

47
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,639
For example, a sarcastic comment like,
Oh great, another amazing update.

48
00:02:46,985 --> 00:02:49,565
could be misinterpreted
as positive feedback.

49
00:02:49,654 --> 00:02:51,545
Another challenge is scalability.

50
00:02:51,675 --> 00:02:54,915
The more channels we monitor,
the harder it became to scale the

51
00:02:54,915 --> 00:02:57,165
system while maintaining accuracy.

52
00:02:57,475 --> 00:03:02,144
We created an AI driven platform that
collected data from multiple sources,

53
00:03:02,344 --> 00:03:04,825
including Twitter, Facebook, and forums.

54
00:03:05,074 --> 00:03:09,245
We used natural language processing to
analyze sentiment and detect trends.

55
00:03:09,765 --> 00:03:13,904
We developed a formula to calculate
reputational risks in monetary terms.

56
00:03:14,024 --> 00:03:17,345
This way, we increased monitoring
coverage from 10 percent to

57
00:03:17,345 --> 00:03:22,285
70, providing a clear and more
comprehensive view of public sentiment.

58
00:03:22,865 --> 00:03:27,374
The response time to critical
incidents improved by over 60%.

59
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:32,264
We created a formula to calculate
reputational risks in monetary terms.

60
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:33,334
Stakeholders

61
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:38,144
This project showed us the potential
of artificial intelligence, but it

62
00:03:38,144 --> 00:03:40,074
also highlighted its limitations.

63
00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:43,424
AI alone can analyze, but can't interact.

64
00:03:43,674 --> 00:03:48,174
This is where Internet of Things
steps in, offering physical and

65
00:03:48,214 --> 00:03:52,934
interactive components to collect
and act on feedback in real time.

66
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:58,319
Before we explore Internet of Things
solutions, let's sum up why AI alone isn't

67
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:00,139
always enough for feedback collection.

68
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:02,859
AI can struggle with emotions and tone.

69
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:07,609
As I mentioned earlier, feedback
this is amazing, could be sarcastic,

70
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,469
but AI might flag it as positive.

71
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:15,029
AI system typically
analyze data passively.

72
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:19,369
They don't ask follow up questions
or clearly ambiguous feedback.

73
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:24,939
While AI process data quickly, it's
still analyzing what's already happened.

74
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:29,269
It doesn't collect data proactively,
but Which means opportunities to

75
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,409
address issues in real time are missed.

76
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:33,689
Why Internet of Things
for feedback collection?

77
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:36,759
Traditional feedback systems are reactive.

78
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:41,129
Internet of Things enable proactive,
continuous feedback collection.

79
00:04:41,969 --> 00:04:46,769
Now let's define two key types of feedback
Internet of Things can help to collect.

80
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:49,149
Explicit and implicit.

81
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,259
Explicit feedback.

82
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,809
This is when a customer directly
tells you what they think.

83
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:59,179
For example, selecting a rating on a
feedback screen after the transaction.

84
00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:03,479
Explicit feedback is clear and
direct, but it's often limited.

85
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:06,549
Not all customers take
the time to give it.

86
00:05:06,989 --> 00:05:10,339
Implicit feedback comes with
observing customer behavior.

87
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:15,169
Examples include how long a customer
interacts with a product or screen,

88
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:20,349
repeatedly pressing a button on
the screen, the tone of the voice

89
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,159
when saying, this ATM is great,
which could indicate sarcasm.

90
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:28,979
Implicit feedback is valuable because
it captures data that customers

91
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,609
might not express explicitly.

92
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:35,459
Let's bring this concept to life
with the practical examples of how

93
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:39,219
Internet of Things and Artificial
Intelligence can work together to

94
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:40,869
enhance client feedback collection.

95
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,959
Imagine a customer using a smart ATM.

96
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:52,019
The machine fails to dispense cash
and they mutter, This ATM is useless.

97
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:57,424
With IoT enabled ATM, microphones
detect verbal frustration,

98
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:02,924
sensors monitor repeated button
presses or prolonged interactions.

99
00:06:03,314 --> 00:06:08,124
Using this information, banks can
schedule maintenance or software

100
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,324
updates for specific ATMs.

101
00:06:11,114 --> 00:06:14,484
Insights can also inform
design improvements, like

102
00:06:14,484 --> 00:06:15,804
simplifying the interface.

103
00:06:16,284 --> 00:06:19,734
Potential impacts include
customer frustration decreases,

104
00:06:20,044 --> 00:06:21,454
improving satisfaction.

105
00:06:22,124 --> 00:06:26,464
Banks can see reduced churn and
increased trust in their services.

106
00:06:26,514 --> 00:06:28,354
Now let's look at another example.

107
00:06:28,674 --> 00:06:33,474
In a smart bank office, IoT
enabled kiosks or screens assist

108
00:06:33,474 --> 00:06:38,324
customers with transactions, account
inquiries, or loans applications.

109
00:06:38,694 --> 00:06:42,734
If a customer finds a confusing
interface or feels the service is

110
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:47,944
slow, they might say, Why this takes
so long or show frustrations through

111
00:06:47,944 --> 00:06:49,594
aggressive tapping on the screen?

112
00:06:49,764 --> 00:06:54,464
IoT devices track voice, gestures,
and touch patterns using pressure

113
00:06:54,554 --> 00:06:56,474
sensitive displays and sensors.

114
00:06:56,894 --> 00:07:01,244
AI detects frustration or dissatisfaction
in tone or interaction style.

115
00:07:01,744 --> 00:07:04,814
It links the feedback to
specific processes, such

116
00:07:04,814 --> 00:07:06,584
as loan application delays.

117
00:07:07,114 --> 00:07:10,384
Artificial intelligence and
Internet of Things together

118
00:07:10,624 --> 00:07:15,654
provide instant suggestions or
fixes via the IoT enabled kiosk.

119
00:07:15,704 --> 00:07:19,854
Bank managers use aggregated
insights to redesign flows or

120
00:07:19,854 --> 00:07:21,994
improve customer support strategies.

121
00:07:22,284 --> 00:07:25,944
The potential impact of implementing
such a system is significant.

122
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:31,799
It reduces customer churn by addressing
frustrations in real time, making

123
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:33,669
customers feel heard and valued.

124
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:38,189
It increases trust in bank
services as customers see

125
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,069
issues being resolved promptly.

126
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,159
It improves overall operational
efficiency by highlighting bottlenecks

127
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:48,579
and enabling targeted improvements.

128
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,969
Here's why Internet of
Things is a game changer.

129
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:56,609
It captures organic, unfiltered
feedback during the service experience

130
00:07:56,929 --> 00:08:01,049
and allows for immediate responses,
improving client experience.

131
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:06,419
It goes beyond verbal feedback to
include touch patterns, interaction

132
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:11,959
times and gesture analysis, offering
deeper insights into customer behavior.

133
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:16,769
It identifies trends before they
escalate into larger problems and

134
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:19,259
helps allocate resources effectively.

135
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:22,299
This reduces churn and builds trust.

136
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:26,919
Let's take a closer look at the challenges
and opportunities that come with

137
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:29,499
implemented IoT driven feedback system.

138
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,429
First challenge is data integration.

139
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:36,799
Combining IoT and AI data with
existing systems, like traditional

140
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,329
feedback collection tools or
CRMs, can be technically complex.

141
00:08:41,619 --> 00:08:44,779
Each system may use different
formats or protocols, making

142
00:08:45,294 --> 00:08:47,394
Seamless integration, a challenge.

143
00:08:47,614 --> 00:08:49,894
Next, there are privacy concerns.

144
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:56,424
Customers might feel uneasy about being
recorded or monitored by IoT devices.

145
00:08:56,594 --> 00:08:57,984
Transparency is essential.

146
00:08:58,294 --> 00:09:02,174
Businesses need to clearly
communicate what data is being

147
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:07,694
collected, how it's used, and ensure
compliance with privacy regulations.

148
00:09:08,144 --> 00:09:09,974
Finally, device adoption.

149
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:15,649
Encouraging customers to interact with
IoT devices requires thoughtful design.

150
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:20,579
If the device is too complicated,
customers may avoid using it.

151
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:26,009
The key is to make the experience
intuitive, non intrusive, and

152
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:27,319
valuable for the customer.

153
00:09:27,619 --> 00:09:30,809
Now let's talk about the
opportunities that IoT driven

154
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:33,199
feedback systems bring to the table.

155
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:38,199
First, IoT allows for a
continuous feedback process.

156
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:44,459
Unlike traditional methods, which often
rely on periodic surveys, IoT devices

157
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,889
can provide ongoing real time insights.

158
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:50,409
This makes feedback more
accurate and actionable.

159
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:54,639
Second, IoT enables
closing the feedback loop.

160
00:09:54,919 --> 00:10:00,399
Systems can respond instantly to feedback,
whether it's addressing the issue on the

161
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,569
spot or making adjustments in real time.

162
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:08,899
This not only solves problems faster,
but also builds a trust with customers.
