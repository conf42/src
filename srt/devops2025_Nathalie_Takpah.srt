00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,010
Hello, my name.

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,859
Hello, my name is Natalie Tapa,
and welcome to my talk on the

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,550
impact of Internet of Things
on supply chain cybersecurity.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,625
Just to give you a background of
my topic, supply chain is Basically

5
00:00:13,774 --> 00:00:18,015
the network of processes, people
and resources involved in producing

6
00:00:18,015 --> 00:00:21,075
and delivering a product or service.

7
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:28,965
This involves the acquisition of raw
material, distribution and storage,

8
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:34,700
transportation, Until the item or
service gets to the final user.

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,550
So it's typically all the stages
involved in the value chain.

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,890
Whilst Internet of Things connects
physical devices with sensors, softwares,

11
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:50,860
and platforms to collect and exchange data
over the internet, enabling automation

12
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,220
and efficiency in various applications.

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:01:01,754
And cyber security is the practice of
Protecting this softwares, this system and

14
00:01:01,755 --> 00:01:05,295
this platform from unauthorized access.

15
00:01:05,825 --> 00:01:11,495
Cyber attack and damage the Internet
of Things and supply chain management,

16
00:01:11,925 --> 00:01:15,465
the global supply chain management
empowered by the Internet of Things

17
00:01:15,645 --> 00:01:20,485
is transforming with unprecedented
efficiency and connectivity.

18
00:01:20,965 --> 00:01:26,815
So over the years, supply chain operation
globally have seen massive improvement

19
00:01:26,815 --> 00:01:32,130
in productivity, courtesy the use of
Internet of Things and It's a very

20
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:39,000
real operation and stages according
to statistics that, 2021 internet of

21
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,690
things market is projected to reach 1.

22
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:47,540
1 trillion by 2026 with a cut of 24.

23
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,160
7 percent from 2021 connected devices.

24
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,089
12.

25
00:01:54,089 --> 00:01:59,470
3 billion in 2020 is expected to
exceed 30 billion by this year 2025.

26
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,140
Smart homes.

27
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:09,000
Over 70 million smart home by this
year 2025 boost, boosting demand

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,090
of Internet of Things devices.

29
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,880
Industrial Internet of Things is
expected to generate 15 trillion in

30
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,590
value by 2030, enhancing efficiency.

31
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,860
And in healthcare, Internet of Things
connected medical devices is expected

32
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:35,080
Billion dollars in 2021
to 182 billion by 2027.

33
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,160
The role of internet of
things in supply chain.

34
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,520
So Internet of Things connect produces
distributors and customers globally.

35
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,210
This also.

36
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:51,990
Enhance efficiency and
visibility in it operations.

37
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,649
How does the internet of things
transform supply chain management?

38
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:02,110
We could talk about efficiency,
which, real time tracking of shipping

39
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:08,271
companies, we've seen most shipping
companies, with RFID and GPS.

40
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:15,312
some companies have like barcodes
or pallets to track or consignment

41
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,172
at any given point in time.

42
00:03:17,642 --> 00:03:22,642
We have automated inventory management
also in warehouse where shelves have

43
00:03:22,642 --> 00:03:28,601
sensors that when an item is taken off
a particular shelves, it records the

44
00:03:28,602 --> 00:03:34,002
type, the color and the quantity of
this item taken off, which actually

45
00:03:34,052 --> 00:03:36,341
informed the decision on the item.

46
00:03:36,602 --> 00:03:42,432
What needed to be stocked and
when example as could be made of e

47
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:48,812
commerce companies like Amazon that
uses robots in stocking its shelves.

48
00:03:49,322 --> 00:03:56,292
We have pharmaceutical companies
using thermometer that record specific

49
00:03:56,342 --> 00:04:03,097
temperature and it's Storage space
and also coaching companies, and

50
00:04:03,107 --> 00:04:07,567
this goes a long way to improve
decision making and quality.

51
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:13,057
We have predicting maintenance for
machineries where machines have sensors.

52
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:20,682
example could be the automotive industry
where the sensors informed when That

53
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:25,452
machine needs a maintenance or an update.

54
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:32,497
we have been connected things, you
know, by With the help of Internet

55
00:04:32,517 --> 00:04:37,957
of Things collecting all this data,
informed decision making by industry

56
00:04:37,957 --> 00:04:45,477
players, and also help in predictive
analysis to mitigate risk and disruption.

57
00:04:45,977 --> 00:04:52,017
So according to Morgan Stanley, Automation
World Industrial Survey, AlphaWise,

58
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:57,957
some companies share their benefits
from Internet of things in the supply

59
00:04:57,957 --> 00:05:07,132
chain operations, there was an improving
operational efficiency, which A seed, 45%.

60
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:13,942
There was an improving productivity
by over 30%, creating new

61
00:05:13,942 --> 00:05:21,402
businesses opportunity by nearly
30%, producing downtime by 27%,

62
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:25,122
maximizing asset utilization by 26%.

63
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:28,942
Ability to sell product as serviced by.

64
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:36,012
18 percent reducing assets life cycle
cost by 18 percent enhancing worker

65
00:05:36,892 --> 00:05:44,252
safety by 15 percent enhancing product
innovation process by 13 percent and

66
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:51,062
better understanding of customer demands
by about 8% So this basically shows

67
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:56,982
how Internet of Things impacted these
various companies, these various sectors.

68
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:02,132
there are also some dark side of
Internet of Things and supply chain.

69
00:06:02,632 --> 00:06:04,652
And that is what we're here to talk about.

70
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:10,332
And so some of them could be,
key vulnerabilities like lack of

71
00:06:10,632 --> 00:06:15,322
standardization in the Internet of
Things devices, expanding attack

72
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:20,062
surface with billions of devices
and sensitive data exposure.

73
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:23,902
For example, the solar
wind bridge in 2020.

74
00:06:24,192 --> 00:06:32,332
So what happened in 2020 is that around
Late 2020, there was a backdoor ingestion

75
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:38,552
into updates, which affected thousands
of customers, including governmental

76
00:06:38,552 --> 00:06:42,412
agencies and Fortune 500 companies.

77
00:06:42,912 --> 00:06:50,732
We could also talk about the data
on over 3, 000 airbus suppliers,

78
00:06:51,102 --> 00:06:52,912
and this is a giant thing.

79
00:06:53,707 --> 00:07:02,547
aircraft manufacturing, industry,
their data, the data of Over 3, 000 of

80
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,937
their suppliers was linked or attacked.

81
00:07:06,437 --> 00:07:12,427
There is also an example of
MirableNet attack on crebs,

82
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:15,777
cameras, and routers in 2016.

83
00:07:16,597 --> 00:07:21,021
So how do we balance innovation
and risk in connected work?

84
00:07:21,522 --> 00:07:25,132
In a connected world, balancing
innovation with risk requires

85
00:07:25,322 --> 00:07:30,452
integrating robust security into
every layer of Internet of Things and

86
00:07:30,452 --> 00:07:36,352
supply chain operation by prioritizing
resilience alongside technology.

87
00:07:37,262 --> 00:07:37,992
process.

88
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:44,752
So it is encouraged that as much as
companies are investing in innovation,

89
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:51,602
there should be a thought to invest
in security measures to protect

90
00:07:52,332 --> 00:07:54,952
or safeguard these innovations.

91
00:07:55,452 --> 00:08:02,527
Some of the strategies to protect Supply
chain operation from cyber attack include

92
00:08:02,947 --> 00:08:09,237
the adoptation of net zero architecture,
where it should be assumed that every

93
00:08:09,237 --> 00:08:11,907
device or network may be compromised.

94
00:08:12,407 --> 00:08:16,287
Hence, there is a need to
implement strict access control.

95
00:08:16,977 --> 00:08:22,317
Also, enhance endpoint security
by encrypting Internet of Things

96
00:08:22,317 --> 00:08:25,317
devices and ensure regular update.

97
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:30,962
There is also a need to collaborate
with vendors for security design.

98
00:08:31,502 --> 00:08:39,412
So as much as, I mean, there is,
investment towards robot software to

99
00:08:39,412 --> 00:08:45,632
use or what platform, there should be
a collaborate, a collaboration between

100
00:08:45,802 --> 00:08:53,632
this, other companies that develop
secure, platforms or software to protect.

101
00:08:54,392 --> 00:08:55,962
the supply chain system.

102
00:08:56,462 --> 00:09:01,752
Other strategies include improve
visibility where the use of

103
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:08,462
artificial intelligence to determine
anomalies and also implement

104
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:10,626
blockchain to secure records.

105
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:17,062
It's also advisable to create Share
to create share security standard

106
00:09:17,102 --> 00:09:19,942
and join intelligent platform.

107
00:09:20,432 --> 00:09:26,692
So this is basically collaboration
among industry players.

108
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:32,102
You know, to share information, to
know the latest happening, where

109
00:09:32,102 --> 00:09:37,722
the latest attack is happening, and
what needed to be done, or what is

110
00:09:37,722 --> 00:09:43,102
the latest safeguarding measures
that everybody needed, to know of.

111
00:09:43,602 --> 00:09:44,872
Future outlook.

112
00:09:44,872 --> 00:09:49,722
So we can talk about autonomous vehicle
and self healing logistics network.

113
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:55,062
Predictive risk management with artificial
intelligence and Internet of Things.

114
00:09:55,692 --> 00:09:59,322
Collaborative framework
for cyber security.

115
00:09:59,822 --> 00:10:07,607
So, There is also a call to action where
Internet of Things, as much as it offers

116
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:14,037
massive opportunity, as much as it is
helping to improve productivity and

117
00:10:14,297 --> 00:10:21,067
efficiency, it is also requiring reports
of security, prioritizing cyber security.

118
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:28,556
Alongside investment that have been made
towards innovation and also collaborating

119
00:10:28,557 --> 00:10:35,417
with government agencies, industry
players and tech leaders, basically

120
00:10:35,497 --> 00:10:44,467
all stakeholders involved in this
cyber attack or safeguarding, Internet

121
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:47,327
of Things and supply chain operation.

122
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:48,507
Thank you.
