00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,310
my name is Marish Bal and I am going
to talk about agent automation and

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,919
how it's going to change, the world
of business process operations.

4
00:00:08,979 --> 00:00:09,399
today.

5
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:13,689
Excited about the topic and a
pleasure to be in front of you.

6
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:16,449
Let me tell you a little
bit about, myself.

7
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:19,929
I'm currently based in Texas,
had an opportunity to work with,

8
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:23,659
various firms, global system
integrators, as well as startups.

9
00:00:24,049 --> 00:00:26,299
In India, Australia, and here in the us.

10
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:30,309
like most of you, I
started off as a developer.

11
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:33,579
Probably I'm, I was not
as good as you guys are.

12
00:00:33,889 --> 00:00:37,759
and switched over to consulting
very quickly after my MBA and then,

13
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:39,969
had, stints in account management.

14
00:00:40,404 --> 00:00:46,004
As a sales hunter, here in the US
for, it's been about close to 12,

15
00:00:46,065 --> 00:00:50,305
13 years that I've been, in sales
and, and, business development.

16
00:00:50,935 --> 00:00:54,445
The current role that I have
is probably a mix of everything

17
00:00:54,445 --> 00:00:55,495
that I've done in the past.

18
00:00:55,855 --> 00:01:00,885
I'm a GTM lead for one of the key
generative AI agent tech, automation

19
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:03,655
offerings at, AWS Excited to tell you.

20
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,860
More about it and what, this, this
technology is going to unfold in the

21
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,680
sphere of business process operations.

22
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,400
On a lighter note, I feel, it's time.

23
00:01:15,405 --> 00:01:19,325
From the point where we are, to a
point where toasters start talking

24
00:01:19,325 --> 00:01:22,595
to you and potentially, start
giving us relationship advice.

25
00:01:23,075 --> 00:01:24,305
but it's not too far too.

26
00:01:24,305 --> 00:01:25,985
so let's be prepared with that.

27
00:01:26,555 --> 00:01:29,735
now I. Going to a little serious problems.

28
00:01:29,735 --> 00:01:29,945
Right?

29
00:01:29,975 --> 00:01:31,785
what's happening in enterprises?

30
00:01:32,185 --> 00:01:35,625
I have a chance to work
with lot of, customers and,

31
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,845
companies that, that are large.

32
00:01:38,175 --> 00:01:44,235
And what I have seen over the past few
years is that most enterprises have

33
00:01:44,265 --> 00:01:49,635
tons of applications, and some of those
applications are productivity apps.

34
00:01:50,055 --> 00:01:51,375
Many are ERP apps.

35
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,310
Off the shelf apps, custom apps,
you name it, and they have it.

36
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,530
unfortunately many of these
applications don't talk to each other.

37
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,650
And how do we solve that problem?

38
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,960
we absolutely need to
integrate these applications.

39
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,950
So how do we do that?

40
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,860
The solution is people.

41
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,530
Let's throw people at the problem
and let people act as a glue and let

42
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,630
people run the applications and the
processes that layer on top of that.

43
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:28,410
But what happens because of this is the
fact that, the people get frustrated.

44
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:35,790
They are stuck in mundane, repetitive
jobs, which they don't like.

45
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,990
and they really don't have any
time for process improvement.

46
00:02:39,365 --> 00:02:44,115
They don't have time to talk to
their customers and, think about

47
00:02:44,115 --> 00:02:46,065
what more they can achieve for them.

48
00:02:46,485 --> 00:02:50,195
And as a result, everyone
becomes an, less productive.

49
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:55,415
So how do we solve that problem
has been, one of the key issues

50
00:02:55,415 --> 00:03:00,720
that's been grappling the large
enterprises all over the world now.

51
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,390
There has been a solution.

52
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:08,180
We have been thinking about automation,
and when I'm talking about these,

53
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:14,100
processes, I'm talking about the,
the processes that enterprises run.

54
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,740
So I'm talking about the
white collar processes.

55
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,390
I'm not talking about the industrial
processes and industrial manufacturing.

56
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,220
I'm talking about processes like.

57
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:24,645
An invoice process.

58
00:03:24,645 --> 00:03:27,705
For example, I'm talking
about sales order processing.

59
00:03:27,705 --> 00:03:31,185
I'm talking about claims processing
in healthcare and in insurance.

60
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:33,615
I'm talking about those kind of processes.

61
00:03:33,945 --> 00:03:38,825
Now, automation has always been a
solution and there are various flavors

62
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:42,845
of automation, When I say various
flavors of automation, what I mean is

63
00:03:43,235 --> 00:03:45,515
there is robotic process automation.

64
00:03:45,545 --> 00:03:48,245
Many of you probably have
heard of that technology.

65
00:03:48,615 --> 00:03:53,035
it's, it's a great technology if you
want to solve a simple problem and

66
00:03:53,245 --> 00:03:58,915
you need some rules based engine to
automate a business process, fantastic.

67
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:01,475
but then RP has its challenges.

68
00:04:01,505 --> 00:04:03,005
It is fragile in nature.

69
00:04:03,335 --> 00:04:05,885
It doesn't lend well itself for.

70
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,700
Complex processes where there
is unstructured data requires

71
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,320
a big infrastructure footprint.

72
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,990
API integration is of course a
domain of, developers when it

73
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,540
comes to adopting API integration.

74
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,230
One of the biggest challenges is the
legacy apps don't even expose API.

75
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,550
So how do you deal with that?

76
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,230
document processing?

77
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,315
All of us know that in the last few years.

78
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:34,365
Document processing has increased
and has unfolded like a beast.

79
00:04:34,795 --> 00:04:37,135
and what I mean by document
pro, what I mean by document

80
00:04:37,135 --> 00:04:39,175
processing is processing of.

81
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:46,200
PDFs to clean insights from
those PDFs, from images that are

82
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,280
circulating across, enterprises.

83
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,390
And then there are, low-code,
no-code technologies.

84
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,490
Data integration has
been there for a while.

85
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,800
machine learning models have been
existing and now, LMS are also being used.

86
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,305
interestingly in back office,
front office, and middle office

87
00:05:02,305 --> 00:05:08,365
processes, which is where most of the
productivity is locked now because

88
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:10,685
of all this, it's a challenge.

89
00:05:10,715 --> 00:05:12,995
How do you make it simple?

90
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:16,825
And that's when you know, we
have agents to the rescue.

91
00:05:17,455 --> 00:05:22,265
What are agents that, this is what, talk
of the town is, everyone wants to talk

92
00:05:22,265 --> 00:05:24,485
about agents, but what are these agents.

93
00:05:25,385 --> 00:05:31,025
In the simplistic terms, and most of
you have probably, dabbled in this space

94
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:33,465
and you are trying to, work with agents.

95
00:05:33,765 --> 00:05:35,775
For me, I have a very simple example.

96
00:05:35,775 --> 00:05:41,185
This is a beautiful, graphic that I found
on, vectorize.io, thanks to the creators.

97
00:05:41,555 --> 00:05:46,955
what this graphic shows in the
simplest of terms is there is an

98
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:49,895
LLM as a foundation of an agent.

99
00:05:50,315 --> 00:05:52,175
And think about LLM as a brain.

100
00:05:52,655 --> 00:05:57,225
there is, an orchestration,
which means there is an input

101
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,395
that you need to provide.

102
00:05:58,395 --> 00:06:02,175
And that input can come from a web
app, can come from chat, it can

103
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:04,195
come from a mobile app, wherever.

104
00:06:04,695 --> 00:06:10,665
And then there is the last layer where
you need to provide tools for the

105
00:06:10,665 --> 00:06:12,885
agent to actually accomplish something.

106
00:06:13,515 --> 00:06:18,655
Just like how, you need
a ax to cut the wood.

107
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:24,145
For the lack of a better example here,
in this case, you would need tools.

108
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:28,245
And the tools in this
case can be, a web portal.

109
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:32,535
It can be an application, it
can be a knowledge base, it can

110
00:06:32,535 --> 00:06:35,925
be some business logic that's
embedded, can be a SaaS platform.

111
00:06:36,285 --> 00:06:37,965
It can even be user interaction.

112
00:06:38,235 --> 00:06:40,425
This is how the agents are structured.

113
00:06:41,115 --> 00:06:46,215
Now, it sounds fantastic on
paper, but is it easy to deploy?

114
00:06:46,715 --> 00:06:47,675
that's a question mark.

115
00:06:48,185 --> 00:06:52,465
Again, you have, APIs, who's
going to build those APIs?

116
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:54,025
Are there common standards?

117
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,165
No, vector dbs.

118
00:06:56,665 --> 00:07:01,715
Some of us may be, really ninjas at
Vector db, but what about the others?

119
00:07:01,765 --> 00:07:02,545
the commoners.

120
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:09,340
so it's a complex technology to implement,
easy to understand, because all the magic

121
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,650
is anyway done by the LLM reasoning.

122
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:17,920
But then there are a lot of issues that
we need to understand before we go about

123
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,630
implementing the agent architecture.

124
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,640
And the next thing is, are
these agents sufficient enough?

125
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,890
Can you just implement agents
across the organization and.

126
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,130
Let them, do their trick and automate
very complex business processes that

127
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,989
are, executed by hundreds of people.

128
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,779
That's another question mark.

129
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:40,059
So how do we take it to the next level?

130
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:41,519
And that's where.

131
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:43,859
Lamb, comes into the mix.

132
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:44,819
What is lamb?

133
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:48,029
Lamb is a large action model.

134
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,719
what is a large action model?

135
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,490
I try to keep it really simple, right?

136
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,640
LLM is, the brain.

137
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:01,020
and if I call LLM, the brain, the large
action model is Braun and the whole,

138
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,390
gist of a large action model is in
its name that it takes actions, LLMs

139
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,699
understand, understands and summarizes.

140
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,960
another thing about lambs is that.

141
00:08:11,754 --> 00:08:15,355
Many of the lambs and a great
example of that is computer use from

142
00:08:15,355 --> 00:08:17,785
anthropic operator from open ai.

143
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:22,065
these are trained with specific
integration with certain tools like

144
00:08:22,065 --> 00:08:28,595
browsers, to automate and execute
certain tasks, based on natural language.

145
00:08:28,895 --> 00:08:32,435
So lamb absolutely sounds more powerful.

146
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:38,735
But the problem is, if you tell the
lamb to perform certain actions in

147
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:43,565
a series of steps, like 70 or 80
steps, it may not be able to do it.

148
00:08:43,595 --> 00:08:49,870
A four or five step process like book,
me, a nice Italian dinner in a restaurant

149
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:56,920
in New York at 7:00 PM on, right before
Thanksgiving, when the week is crazy.

150
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,340
And then also book me a couple
of tickets for a Broadway show.

151
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,280
It can very well do it.

152
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,700
It may also even ask you follow up
questions and get clarifications.

153
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,480
But when it comes to executing
a complex business process,

154
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:10,980
then it becomes challenging.

155
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,250
And, then how do we do that?

156
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,710
How do we even, crack that puzzle?

157
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:22,410
Now, that is where, What we need to do
is we need to think about orchestration.

158
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:31,800
How do we execute processes with lambs,
with LLMs, with document processing,

159
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:38,910
with API, integration with, low code,
no code, and put all of that together.

160
00:09:39,585 --> 00:09:41,355
And that is, I think, the secret sauce.

161
00:09:41,355 --> 00:09:46,785
And as developers, we need to think about
how do we put that mechanisms together?

162
00:09:46,845 --> 00:09:48,705
Are there any solutions in the market?

163
00:09:49,245 --> 00:09:55,565
Because if we are able to do it, we
can automate very complex processes.

164
00:09:56,025 --> 00:10:00,040
something of what I've written
here, invoice processing, claims

165
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:04,635
processing, and these processes sound
simple, but in large enterprises.

166
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:10,485
Fortune 500 fortune thousand companies,
hundreds, if not thousands of people

167
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,165
are engaged in these processes.

168
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:17,975
you will not believe, there are banks
and financial institutions where 300,

169
00:10:18,005 --> 00:10:24,375
500 people, thousand people are engaged
in doing just, anti money laundering

170
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,925
checks, know your customer checks.

171
00:10:27,345 --> 00:10:30,975
Those are the processes where
productivity is absolutely required.

172
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:32,805
what is the value?

173
00:10:32,955 --> 00:10:38,685
McKinsey estimates the value to
be garnered from automation of

174
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:46,155
these processes using generative
AI is close to 2.6 to 4.4 trillion.

175
00:10:46,965 --> 00:10:51,415
They, of course, estimate, estimate
the total economic potential, but

176
00:10:51,415 --> 00:10:55,195
it, these are staggering numbers
and this is all achievable.

177
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,120
If you think about the US healthcare,
there is the whole, the money spent on

178
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,820
healthcare in the US is $4 trillion.

179
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,160
Guess what?

180
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,840
How much of that is waste?

181
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:12,750
$1 trillion because of inefficient
processes, and if we are able

182
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:18,840
to use agents and generative AI
technology to its maximum potential.

183
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,960
We should be able to cut that down.

184
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,030
And that is precisely what we want.

185
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,540
So these are the things that
we need to be, cognizant of

186
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,880
that the impact is massive.

187
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,810
We can do a whole lot with
the Asian tech technology.

188
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:39,980
it may sound complex, but the best part
is the technology's getting mature.

189
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,850
The price of, the foundational
models is dropping.

190
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:48,755
So it's a no-brainer that we got
to use that in what we are doing.

191
00:11:49,705 --> 00:11:56,755
I just want to leave you as, developers to
think about some of the key challenges of

192
00:11:56,965 --> 00:11:59,185
putting all these technologies together.

193
00:11:59,245 --> 00:12:03,865
The large action model, LLMs with a
view to automate a business process.

194
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:08,065
The first one I mentioned earlier,
orchestration of services.

195
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:10,885
while you have these multiple tools.

196
00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:16,915
How can you seamlessly orchestrate
them to achieve the desired

197
00:12:16,915 --> 00:12:18,415
impact and the business outcome?

198
00:12:18,415 --> 00:12:23,845
Because if I am a business user who's,
worried about, managing the benefits

199
00:12:23,845 --> 00:12:28,515
administration process in, my HR role.

200
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,770
I really don't care what
technology am I using.

201
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,280
I care about the outcome
and how it is orchestrated.

202
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,410
What is the transparency in the process?

203
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,950
Can I check how my work
item is progressing?

204
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,280
What is the output
that's coming out to me?

205
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,020
What are the analytics?

206
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,720
Am I measuring the right metrics?

207
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,340
That's what I care about.

208
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,600
I don't care about technology.

209
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:57,170
As developers, we need to make sure
that we need to put, an orchestration

210
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:01,110
layer, which can make these,
technologies integrate together.

211
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,970
Complex, no, no doubt.

212
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,400
While LLMs mask a lot of complexity, but
putting the governance, the responsible

213
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,280
AI and the guardrails is absolute must.

214
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,620
Without that, you cannot really
build the trust that is required with

215
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,210
your business partners as well as,
the leadership and you will never

216
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,070
be able to execute key processes.

217
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:24,940
Think about it.

218
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:31,780
Will you be okay with a 90%
accuracy in a process that

219
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,150
processes your monthly paycheck?

220
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,980
You will not be, these are
deterministic processes.

221
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:44,170
I. You will have to have the trust
that every single time the process gets

222
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:49,960
executed and you get your check, the
numbers are right, every single cent is

223
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:56,350
appropriate, and that is where you need
auditability, governance, responsible ai.

224
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,250
And lastly, all these processes.

225
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:04,240
While great, we understand that
LLMs have a tendency to hallucinate.

226
00:14:04,975 --> 00:14:10,855
We need human in the loop for certain
edge cases so that we understand,

227
00:14:11,365 --> 00:14:16,445
humans, verify the output and then
let those transactions through.

228
00:14:16,445 --> 00:14:22,885
And lastly, the most important thing
in this whole agent take automation

229
00:14:22,885 --> 00:14:24,865
initiative, if at all, you embark on that.

230
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:29,995
Is the fact that we need to have
appropriate change management.

231
00:14:30,415 --> 00:14:31,945
This is a cultural change.

232
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:37,575
We need to advise, your
leadership, what kind of, Approach.

233
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:39,825
They need to take, they need
to be open to technology.

234
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:45,445
Some of the earlier govern governance
principles, archaic, security

235
00:14:45,445 --> 00:14:46,975
policies, they will not work.

236
00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:52,465
We need to work top down, bottom up to
change the culture of the organization

237
00:14:52,465 --> 00:14:58,915
to welcome agents into the workforce,
and we should be okay to work

238
00:14:58,915 --> 00:15:00,895
alongside certain digital employees.

239
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,970
who are going to assist us, make us
more productive and make us deliver

240
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,640
more for less for our customers.

241
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,420
That is the message that
I want to leave you with.

242
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:15,830
if you want to connect with
me, please ping me on LinkedIn.

243
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,610
I'll be happy to chat.

244
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,330
always love to contribute
to the community.

245
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:26,480
And, lastly I want to call out that what
I presented is all my personal opinion.

246
00:15:26,965 --> 00:15:29,355
I have, had that
disclaimer, right up front.

247
00:15:29,725 --> 00:15:33,265
none of this reflects my
employer's, stance on any of

248
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,995
these technologies or the markets.

249
00:15:36,305 --> 00:15:38,015
this is entirely my personal opinion.

250
00:15:38,675 --> 00:15:42,635
Thank you again for the opportunity and
look forward to engaging with you again.

251
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:44,895
Truly appreciate, this, thank you so much.
