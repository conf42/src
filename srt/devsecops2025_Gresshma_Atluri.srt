1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,160
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,660
I'm GR Malu.

3
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,200
I'm a cybersecurity risk
consultant at Chevron.

4
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,270
Over 11 years I spent across in
working with investment banking,

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,730
oil and gas, energy and consulting.

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,220
Majorly focusing on CICD pipelines,
DevSecOps, third party risk

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,020
management, and AI security.

8
00:00:20,995 --> 00:00:25,075
Across the industries I have seen,
one thing in common is it's not just

9
00:00:25,075 --> 00:00:26,995
your code gets you into trouble.

10
00:00:27,325 --> 00:00:31,525
It's about the dependencies,
the CICD pipelines and the

11
00:00:31,525 --> 00:00:33,565
third parties wrapped around it.

12
00:00:34,405 --> 00:00:38,905
Today I talk about software,
supply chain attacks and attacks.

13
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:43,134
Just don't hit your application
directly, but instead target the

14
00:00:43,134 --> 00:00:45,144
tools, dependencies, and the pipelines.

15
00:00:45,144 --> 00:00:46,140
You re, you rely on.

16
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:54,309
These attacks have go grown by 700%,
which is a significant amount in recent

17
00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:58,869
years, and now one of the biggest
risk to the modern organizations.

18
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,759
My goal in this session is to share
practical, real world strategies you can

19
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:09,310
apply to your own DevSecOps pipeline so
that they become proactive and resilient.

20
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,850
Let's move on to the next slide where
we talk about critical threat landscape

21
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,899
and supply chain attacks, and why
supply chain attacks are so dangerous.

22
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:23,559
A modern application is
no longer just your code.

23
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:28,089
It's built from open source library,
third party software development kits

24
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:30,880
and cloud services, and CAC retooling.

25
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:35,335
Attackers have learned that it's
they, if they compromise a trusted

26
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:39,744
software, a delivery channel, for
example, a built pipeline, a popular

27
00:01:39,744 --> 00:01:45,835
open source package, or an update
mechanism that they can impact hundreds

28
00:01:45,835 --> 00:01:48,264
or thousands of organizations at once.

29
00:01:48,774 --> 00:01:53,425
Most enterprise applications today depend
on hundreds of open source sub components,

30
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:57,895
and many of those are transitive
dependencies, and the teams don't

31
00:01:57,895 --> 00:01:59,934
even realize that they are using them.

32
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:04,869
The lack, that lack of visibility
creates perfect hiding places

33
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:06,340
for the attack vectors.

34
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:13,660
We have also shifted from monoliths to
microservices and from OnPrem to hybrid

35
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:19,125
or multi-cloud, and from manual releases
to high velocity CI I CT pipelines.

36
00:02:19,945 --> 00:02:20,785
The great shift.

37
00:02:20,935 --> 00:02:22,885
That's a great shift of innovation.

38
00:02:22,885 --> 00:02:28,565
But that also means like attackers
now have dozens of places to slip in.

39
00:02:28,894 --> 00:02:34,644
For example, package ies, build systems,
pipeline plugins, and vendor APIs.

40
00:02:35,144 --> 00:02:39,765
Oas reflect the shift clearly
and in OVAs top 10 for web.

41
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:43,905
You see the items like vulnerable
and outdated components and

42
00:02:43,905 --> 00:02:46,605
software and data integrity failure.

43
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:51,959
In the O-S-C-I-C-D top 10, risks
like dependency chain abuse,

44
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,399
poisoned pipeline execution, and
inadequate identity access management.

45
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,600
That's literally a description of
the modern supply chain problem.

46
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:06,394
We know from data that organizations
who implemented formal third

47
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:10,950
party risk management programs and
strong DevSecOps practices have

48
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,470
significantly fewer incidents.

49
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,680
So the message is clear.

50
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,460
This is no longer a, just
a checkbox or an edge case.

51
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:24,519
Supply chain now has become a
critical to application security and

52
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:26,829
let's move on to those slide three.

53
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,800
Aware we'll learn about will
modern divesting real world

54
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,275
examples and what their impact are.

55
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:39,520
Let's first talk about SolarWinds,
which is a classic example

56
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,260
of build system compromise.

57
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:48,040
Nations tech attackers infiltrated
the vendors built up environment

58
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,730
and injected malicious code into
the trusted software update.

59
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:57,490
That single update went out around
18,000 customers, including government

60
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:00,070
organizations and large enterprises.

61
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,980
The attack then started the customer.

62
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,620
It started at the
upstream in the pipeline.

63
00:04:06,535 --> 00:04:12,445
Let's talk about Log four J. We saw
how one widely used open source logging

64
00:04:12,445 --> 00:04:14,995
library could become a global emergency.

65
00:04:15,475 --> 00:04:19,195
Most organizations didn't even
know where Log four J was running

66
00:04:19,195 --> 00:04:21,235
because it was buried deep inside.

67
00:04:21,784 --> 00:04:22,864
Other components.

68
00:04:23,164 --> 00:04:27,609
This is the risk of vulnerable and
outdated components, which are exactly

69
00:04:28,109 --> 00:04:31,044
OSP has mentioned in mid Stockton.

70
00:04:31,554 --> 00:04:37,804
In 2024, the CrowdStrike Falcon Update
Falcon content update caused a massive

71
00:04:38,134 --> 00:04:43,145
outage when faulty security update crashed
millions of windows systems worldwide.

72
00:04:43,804 --> 00:04:47,645
This wasn't a malicious attack,
but from resilient perspective, it

73
00:04:47,645 --> 00:04:49,445
behaved like a supply chain failure.

74
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,490
One update pipeline, global Impact.

75
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:58,430
And with platforms like Snowflake, we
have seen how attackers can abuse stolen

76
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,469
credentials, or we can access controls
in third party cloud data service to

77
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,229
access many different organizational data.

78
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,690
The common pattern is simple.

79
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:14,210
The adversary writes on something we
are already trust and update an agent,

80
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,039
a library, or a vendor platform.

81
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:18,460
Let's move on to next slide here.

82
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:24,989
Let in response to these incidents, I
have worked on defense framework that

83
00:05:24,989 --> 00:05:29,969
combines lessons learned and research
industry standards and real implications

84
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:32,659
across sectors like energy and banking.

85
00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:37,944
At high level, the framework has several
pillars, and if you see shit left in

86
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:43,569
DevSecOps, it brings security into
planning, coding, and build stages.

87
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:48,549
That means all the stages of
software development Lifecycle L, and

88
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:53,649
secure the CACD pipelines, lockdown
identities, secrets and infrastructure

89
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:55,629
for your build and deploy systems.

90
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:00,909
Advanced detection use behavioral
analytics to spot unusual activity

91
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:05,229
and runtime application self
protection to detect and block

92
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:07,269
attacks from inside the application.

93
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:12,359
Vendor risk management, continuously
evaluate, monitor, and third

94
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:14,429
party tools and the platforms.

95
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:15,089
Zero.

96
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:20,519
Trust architecture, never trust,
always verify for every component, even

97
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:23,669
internal ones in production environments.

98
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:27,779
When we have applied this framework,
we have seen faster detection of

99
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:32,069
vulnerability, dependencies, and of
measurable detection in tampering

100
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:36,149
incidents and better containment
during the potential compromises.

101
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:41,099
I'll walk you through each of these
pillars in the next upcoming chapters.

102
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,099
Let's move on to the next slide with the.

103
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:48,829
In this chapter one, I'll focus on
how supply chain attacks have evolved

104
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:54,649
and what it looks like today in our
software development ecosystem, we have

105
00:06:54,649 --> 00:07:01,339
more from mostly proprietary monolithic
application to highly con componentized

106
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:06,379
systems that depend on open source
managed services and cloud native coding.

107
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,069
That shift has increased.

108
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:14,259
Speed in innovation, but it has
also multiplied trust relationships.

109
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:16,779
Let's see some modern threat vectors.

110
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:20,279
Let's first talk about
dependency confusion.

111
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,419
You think you are pulling, if you
think you are pulling the company

112
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:29,329
internal logging from your private
registry, but your ci misprioritized

113
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:33,799
the public registry and an attacker
uploads the package with the same name.

114
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:38,299
The build passes the test, even
pass, and you have just to ship

115
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:39,770
the attacker control score.

116
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,099
And let's talk about hypo squatting.

117
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:44,840
Hypo squatting.

118
00:07:44,929 --> 00:07:50,150
Attackers publish packages with the
file names, with the small changes,

119
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,520
or just deferred by one character.

120
00:07:53,104 --> 00:07:58,655
So that means like late night, the
dev, the tire developer mistypes

121
00:07:58,655 --> 00:08:00,574
a name installs the wrong one.

122
00:08:00,574 --> 00:08:05,704
And the malicious payload isn't,
it's simple, but still works and.

123
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:08,960
Let's talk about the CICD compromise.

124
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:11,509
What's worse than a compromised repo?

125
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,119
A clean repo with a
compromised build runner.

126
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:16,070
The source looks perfect.

127
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,389
The malicious payload gets
in injector only at build or

128
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:23,269
packaged package packaging time.

129
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:28,690
The key idea in is that modern
supply chain attacks are not random.

130
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:34,270
The, they systematically exploit the
way we develop and ship software.

131
00:08:34,855 --> 00:08:39,174
Understanding these patterns is the
first step to defending against them.

132
00:08:39,714 --> 00:08:42,085
Let's move on to the next slide.

133
00:08:42,585 --> 00:08:46,485
Let's talk about why traditional
security fails in this slide.

134
00:08:47,145 --> 00:08:54,075
Traditional security models struggle with
the these attacks for a few re reasons.

135
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:58,125
First, like first, older models
are based upon stronger perimeter.

136
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,420
We assume inside the network is
trusted and outside is untrusted.

137
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,910
Distributed pipelines, cloud
services, and remote teams, that

138
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,070
assumption breaks down completely.

139
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,380
Second, many security processes
are still focused on static checks

140
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,180
at the end of the lifecycle.

141
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,290
A final penetration test, a
yearly audit, or occasional.

142
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:27,590
Manual reviews, supply chain attacks,
especially those targeting on CACD

143
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:32,660
often happens in the middle of pipeline
during the bills, packaging, or

144
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,480
updates where checks don't see them.

145
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,350
The third, when we fully trust code
because it is slight signed or delivered

146
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:48,670
by a well-known vendor, we forgot that
signing only proves origin, not safety.

147
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:53,280
If the bill system or maintainer
is compromised, the signed

148
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,770
artifact can still be malicious.

149
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:01,410
This is why we need to change our
mindset from inside is safe to

150
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:06,220
continuous verification and defense in
depth across the enterprise pipeline.

151
00:10:07,045 --> 00:10:09,160
Let's move on the next slide.

152
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,980
In this, let's talk about the cascade.

153
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:16,840
This is one of the most aspects
of supply chain attacks is.

154
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,570
Supply chain effect attacks these days.

155
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,990
Imagine a single popular
open source component.

156
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:27,880
That component is used in dungeons
of libraries, which then get used

157
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,620
into hundreds of applications when
vulnerability or back door appears in

158
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:38,830
that one of the component, the impact
cascades through entire system ecosystem.

159
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,795
We saw this with a log four j. A single
component far down in the dependency tree

160
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:50,835
created crisis for many organizations that
didn't even know that they were using,

161
00:10:50,835 --> 00:10:56,740
that the same Cascade Direct applies
to ci, cd platforms and security tools.

162
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,035
If a widely used build agent or
endpoint agent, which out bad update

163
00:11:02,185 --> 00:11:06,300
like in the CrowdStrike incident,
the consequences are global.

164
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,610
Very huge.

165
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,540
This is why we must treat software supply
chains as a complex interconnector systems

166
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,030
and not just individual applications.

167
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:23,030
Let's move on to next slide where
this is a chapter two, we talk

168
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,710
about resilience, DevSecOps.

169
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:31,030
In this chapter, let's talk about how to
build resilience in your devs practices

170
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,060
so that you can handle this cascade risk.

171
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:41,710
The goal is not to slow the teams, but to
secure, but to bake security into daily

172
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:46,689
workflows, from planning, to coding,
to testing, releasing and operating.

173
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:51,209
We'll look at practical
ideas like shifting security

174
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,250
left into design and coding.

175
00:11:53,939 --> 00:11:58,050
Integrate security checks into
integrate integrated development

176
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,600
environments and pre-committed hooks.

177
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,520
Continuously scanning dependencies
and generating software, bills of

178
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,619
materials and software builds of
materials is a structured list of

179
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:12,479
all components inside your software.

180
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:13,909
I in.

181
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:19,729
These are found foundations that make
later more advanced control effective.

182
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:22,099
Let's move on to next slide.

183
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:23,919
Let's talk now.

184
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:30,025
Let's talk specifically about securing the
CICD pipeline because this is a heart of

185
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:36,854
your software factory As a reminder, c.
It's a, as it is continuous integration

186
00:12:36,854 --> 00:12:39,374
and continuous delivery or deployment.

187
00:12:39,674 --> 00:12:44,984
It's the automated systems that spool
score runs, test to build artifacts

188
00:12:44,984 --> 00:12:47,624
and ships from them to production.

189
00:12:48,104 --> 00:12:51,464
If an attacker controls
your CICD pipeline, they

190
00:12:51,464 --> 00:12:53,474
essentially control what you.

191
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:59,374
The key controls include a majorly
identity access management, ensuring

192
00:12:59,374 --> 00:13:04,324
that build agents, service accounts,
and human users will all have least

193
00:13:04,324 --> 00:13:09,244
privilege only the permissions
they absolutely needed based upon

194
00:13:09,244 --> 00:13:12,004
their role and secret management.

195
00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:15,754
Using the secure walls instead
of hard coding credentials

196
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,019
and configuration or code.

197
00:13:17,644 --> 00:13:22,974
Secret Ma. Isolated runners
treating build agents as ephemeral

198
00:13:23,814 --> 00:13:28,435
shortlived mechanism that are
destroyed after each job, reducing

199
00:13:28,435 --> 00:13:30,384
the chance of persistent compromise.

200
00:13:31,134 --> 00:13:32,604
Network segmentation.

201
00:13:32,905 --> 00:13:35,665
Make sure CICD components cannot freely.

202
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:40,845
Every internal system, especially
production databases, it's also

203
00:13:40,845 --> 00:13:46,725
crucial to manage third party plugins
and actions used by CICD tools, each

204
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:51,834
plugin in efficient, effectively
code that runs in your pipeline so

205
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:56,439
that there should be a review and
approval process for what you allow.

206
00:13:57,175 --> 00:14:04,335
These measures align directly with ova top
10, CACD risks such as inadequate identity

207
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:10,135
access management, dependency chain
abuse, and poisoned pipeline executions.

208
00:14:11,005 --> 00:14:15,525
Let's move on to next slide
where we talk the chapter three.

209
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:19,865
Where we talk about advanced
threat detection, even with the

210
00:14:19,865 --> 00:14:24,635
strong preventive controls, we
have to ensure that something.

211
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,780
Someday we'll slip through.

212
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,480
Here we move beyond basic signature
based detection into techniques that

213
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,120
understand behavior and context.

214
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:40,970
For example, monitoring CCD, unusual
behaviors like a pipeline suddenly

215
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:46,180
pulling a large number of new
dependencies from unfamiliar sources.

216
00:14:46,705 --> 00:14:50,425
Watching for abnormal network
connections from build agents

217
00:14:50,425 --> 00:14:51,925
or application containers.

218
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:57,205
This is where security information
and event management, CM tools

219
00:14:57,205 --> 00:15:03,385
and user and entity be behavior
analytics can play an important role

220
00:15:03,885 --> 00:15:08,625
correlating events and highlighting
anomalies that deserve investigations.

221
00:15:09,345 --> 00:15:13,815
The idea is to quickly answer
the question, is the behavior

222
00:15:13,815 --> 00:15:15,315
normal for this system?

223
00:15:15,585 --> 00:15:19,215
If not, we have, we want to
detect and respond before it

224
00:15:19,215 --> 00:15:21,195
turns into full down incident.

225
00:15:21,695 --> 00:15:25,365
Let's move on to next section slide.

226
00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:29,145
In this slide we talk about runtime
application, self-protection,

227
00:15:29,415 --> 00:15:34,395
a key component of advanced
detection in the ecosystem.

228
00:15:34,895 --> 00:15:39,695
Runtime application, self-protection
technology that runs inside

229
00:15:39,695 --> 00:15:43,355
your application monitors
its behavior in real time.

230
00:15:43,925 --> 00:15:46,925
Unlike a traditional web
application firewall that

231
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:49,320
send sits in your application.

232
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:55,045
And this runtime application, self
protection can see how inputs are

233
00:15:55,045 --> 00:16:00,025
being processed internally and can
block malicious actions even if

234
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:04,565
it play even if the play load has
already reached the application.

235
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:08,945
For example, if you have compromised
dependency, tries to execute a

236
00:16:08,945 --> 00:16:14,040
suspicious command or attempts
unexpected file or network accesses.

237
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,940
REAP can detect that pattern and stop
the request or terminate the session.

238
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,690
So that would really help
when I combine, when combined

239
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,790
with these techniques like us.

240
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:32,345
SaaS static application security testing,
and the dynamic application security

241
00:16:32,345 --> 00:16:35,285
testing test earlier in the lifecycle.

242
00:16:36,065 --> 00:16:40,705
RASP provides laced last line of
defense in the production line.

243
00:16:41,245 --> 00:16:46,795
In practice, we have seen that
organizations use using R-E-C-A-R-E-S-P,

244
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:50,965
especially for their most
critical external facing services.

245
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:55,555
Have much better chances of preventing
vulnerability from turning into a

246
00:16:55,555 --> 00:17:00,025
breach, even when a supply chain
flaw surfaces after deployment.

247
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:04,975
Let's move on to next slide with
the chapter four vendor risk

248
00:17:04,975 --> 00:17:06,805
management, which is very important.

249
00:17:07,285 --> 00:17:14,115
The, this will focus on how to manage
vendor or third party risk management,

250
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:18,555
which is absolutely center to the
key to the supply chain security.

251
00:17:19,335 --> 00:17:26,735
Most of the organizations rely heavily
on software as service, SaaS platform

252
00:17:26,735 --> 00:17:29,425
as service pass and infrastructure.

253
00:17:29,425 --> 00:17:36,085
As service as IAS provides
providers as well as we specialize

254
00:17:36,085 --> 00:17:38,005
security and analytics tools.

255
00:17:38,005 --> 00:17:42,320
Each of these vendors become an
extensive for your attack surface.

256
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,980
Strong third party risk management
programs looks at security certifications

257
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:54,280
like usually reviewing the SOC two type
two reports IS four 27,001 deficiency

258
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,425
reports or PCI DSS where it is based
upon the relevancy of the industry.

259
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:04,915
The vendor own CICD and supply
chain practices, do they use

260
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:08,365
S-P-O-M-S Code Signing and Strong?

261
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:08,995
I do.

262
00:18:08,995 --> 00:18:13,165
They have strong I identity and
access management practices and

263
00:18:13,165 --> 00:18:16,945
there how their incident response
system looks like process looks like.

264
00:18:17,275 --> 00:18:20,560
How quickly do they notify
customers when something goes wrong?

265
00:18:21,235 --> 00:18:26,305
And ongoing continuous monitoring, not
just a questionnaire at onboarding.

266
00:18:26,485 --> 00:18:30,205
It's like how they are doing the
continuous monitoring and how we are

267
00:18:30,205 --> 00:18:32,965
monitoring our third parties continuously.

268
00:18:33,475 --> 00:18:38,035
Incidents like this, like snowflake
breaches, highlight that it's not

269
00:18:38,095 --> 00:18:40,645
enough for a platform to be powerful.

270
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:46,915
It must also be operated securely by both
the vendor and the customers and vendor

271
00:18:46,915 --> 00:18:49,100
risk is shared responsibility and our.

272
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,820
Detentions must reflect that.

273
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:57,550
Let's move on to next slide, the
chapter five zero trust Architecture.

274
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,600
Finally, in this chapter, we we
talk about zero trust architecture,

275
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,780
which is never trust, always verify.

276
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:11,240
Instead of assuming that anything
inside our network is safe zero trust,

277
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,885
assume that threats can exist both
sides inside and outside as well.

278
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:21,550
Organization In a zero trust model
for supply chain and DevSecOps, we

279
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:26,050
require strong authentication and
authorization everywhere, often

280
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,205
using multifactor authentications.

281
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:33,520
Role-based access controls, treat
every component, repositories,

282
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,965
build agents services as needing to
prevent its identity and registry.

283
00:19:39,025 --> 00:19:39,245
Cut.

284
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,860
Continuously, not just once.

285
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:47,200
Use code signing hardware, security
modules, and sometimes trusted

286
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,810
platform modules to anchor trust
in hardware where possible apply

287
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:57,280
microsegmentation so even one part
of the environment is compromised.

288
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,280
Lateral movement is limited.

289
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,480
Zero Trust is not a just a
product, it's a design philosophy.

290
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:09,380
Applied if this is applied correctly,
it significantly reduced the impact

291
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:15,040
of compromised dependency tool or
supplier because nothing nothing

292
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,200
and no one is implicitly trusted.

293
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,140
Let's move on to the next slide.

294
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:27,000
To make this all actionable, I like
to think terms of paced roadmap,

295
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:33,840
foundation enhancement and optimization
foundation in this foundation phase.

296
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,390
And coming next three to six months,
you can enable automated dependency

297
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,670
scanning systems and start generating.

298
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,845
O software builds and of
materials for key applications.

299
00:20:45,935 --> 00:20:48,935
Begin code assigning
for critical artifacts.

300
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:52,895
Establish basic vendor
assessment and T-P-C-R-M process.

301
00:20:53,345 --> 00:20:58,735
Enforce multifactor authentication and
list platforms and critical SaaS tools.

302
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:03,325
Enhancement phase in coming
next six to 12 months.

303
00:21:03,325 --> 00:21:07,495
Deploy RASP runtime
application self protection.

304
00:21:07,915 --> 00:21:12,295
For your most critical external
facing applications, implement

305
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:16,405
behavioral monitoring for CICD
pipelines and production workloads.

306
00:21:16,885 --> 00:21:21,145
Integrate automated security
tests, testing like SaaS and

307
00:21:21,145 --> 00:21:26,455
DA scans and container scanning
throughout your pipelines Rollout.

308
00:21:26,545 --> 00:21:29,965
Continuous vendor monitoring
instead of one-time reviews

309
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,665
optimi at the optimization phase.

310
00:21:32,665 --> 00:21:33,415
It's cons.

311
00:21:33,415 --> 00:21:35,125
It should be considered as ongoing.

312
00:21:35,755 --> 00:21:40,915
Tune detection rules to reduce noise
and focus on high risk anomalies.

313
00:21:41,275 --> 00:21:46,675
Optimize governance, so security control
support, not block development velocity.

314
00:21:47,275 --> 00:21:51,685
Implement advanced capabilities
like software at the station and

315
00:21:51,865 --> 00:21:58,085
a province tracking, for example,
inspired by frameworks like supply

316
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,785
chain levels of for software artifacts.

317
00:22:01,205 --> 00:22:06,245
This idea is to build progressively rather
than trying to do everything at once.

318
00:22:06,745 --> 00:22:08,905
Let's move on to next slide.

319
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,785
Let's wrap up the content.

320
00:22:11,785 --> 00:22:16,445
I want to written to key mindset
shift, moving from reactive

321
00:22:16,445 --> 00:22:18,665
security to proactive defense.

322
00:22:19,115 --> 00:22:23,875
Reactive security waits for an
incident breach, an outa outage,

323
00:22:23,965 --> 00:22:28,050
or a critical vulnerability,
and then scrambles to respond.

324
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,180
Proactive supply chain defense
assumes that vulnerabilities

325
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:37,670
and attacks are inva and designs
resilience into the entire lifecycle.

326
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:43,070
That means treating your DevSecOps
pipeline itself as a primary asset

327
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:49,100
to secure investing in visibility
so you know what components

328
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,750
you run and how they behave.

329
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:55,430
Building layers of defense from
design and development to build

330
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:58,100
deployment and runtime monitoring.

331
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:03,590
Organizations that embrace this
approach are able to maintain

332
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:08,840
development speed while drastic,
drastically reducing the risk.

333
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:12,680
You don't have to choose
between agility and security.

334
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,950
You just have to design
both intentionally.

335
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:20,550
And I would like to thank you so
much for your time and attention.
