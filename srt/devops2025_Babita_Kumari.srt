00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:00,640
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,710
I'm Babita Kumari, senior
software engineer at Microsoft.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:10,389
Today, I'm excited to discuss innovative
cloud architectures, revolutionizing

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,180
enterprise operations for AI integration.

5
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:18,989
We will explore how AI and ML are
transforming the way business operates

6
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:23,869
and innovate, driving efficiency,
and creating new possibilities.

7
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:27,160
In this presentation,
I'll cover four key areas.

8
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:30,689
Advancement in AI powered
cloud architectures.

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,740
A case study showcasing
real world applications.

10
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,700
Best practices for designing
innovative architectures.

11
00:00:38,995 --> 00:00:42,585
Future developments shaping
enterprise operations.

12
00:00:43,135 --> 00:00:45,475
So without further ado, let's dive in.

13
00:00:45,975 --> 00:00:47,175
Let's talk about key advancements.

14
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:52,114
AI and ML are reshaping enterprise
cloud architectures through

15
00:00:52,304 --> 00:00:54,484
these three pivotal advancements.

16
00:00:55,224 --> 00:00:57,644
First one is productive
resource management.

17
00:00:57,864 --> 00:01:02,774
Enterprises nowadays are using AI
to dynamically allocate resources,

18
00:01:03,284 --> 00:01:05,954
achieving up to 91 percent accuracy.

19
00:01:05,954 --> 00:01:06,364
Thanks.

20
00:01:06,955 --> 00:01:12,585
In resource management and also minimizing
waste with automated scaling, machine

21
00:01:12,585 --> 00:01:17,355
learning enables systems to adjust
resources automatically during peak uses,

22
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:20,805
and that improves efficiency by 67%.

23
00:01:21,305 --> 00:01:26,765
Last but not the least, intelligent
security, AI driven threat detection

24
00:01:26,775 --> 00:01:29,814
models now prevent up to 99.

25
00:01:29,814 --> 00:01:32,309
7 percent of potential security breaches.

26
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,860
which provides unmatched
reliability and trust.

27
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,060
So these advancements enable
any enterprise to be agile,

28
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,010
efficient, and also secure,
which is the topmost priority.

29
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,750
So now let's talk about
multi cloud frameworks.

30
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,950
Most enterprises are now embracing
multi cloud frameworks, combining

31
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,340
both public and private clouds.

32
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,930
So public clouds like Azure, AWS ensure
scalability and 99 percent uptime,

33
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,360
hosting the majority of workloads.

34
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,610
Whereas private clouds offer more secure
environments for like credit sensitive

35
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,490
data, ensuring compliance and control.

36
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,310
So this hybrid approach balances
flexibility, performance,

37
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,400
and also cost effectiveness.

38
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,710
So let's talk about what are the
four key layers or key components

39
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,000
for any modern cloud architectures

40
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,520
The first one is data processing
layer which handles up to 100, 000

41
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,670
transactions per second and this
ensure real time insights Then next

42
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,700
comes the AI and ML integration layer.

43
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,980
It supports over 1.

44
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:46,390
5 million daily intelligent operations
and it helps in automated decision making.

45
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,950
The security framework is the
most important one as well.

46
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:56,210
So it gives and implements zero trust
models, safeguarding sensitive data, and

47
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,930
achieving industry leading compliance.

48
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,950
Monitoring and analytics is
also very key, player here.

49
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:09,660
So real time monitoring ensures 99 percent
of time and predictive uses, reservations.

50
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,900
So each layer is essential for delivering
high performing and reliable systems.

51
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,340
So, let's talk about a, case study of
a global manufacturing corporation.

52
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,290
So we'll talk about these
principles and actions.

53
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:28,675
The challenge we faced was a global
manufacturer based efficiencies in

54
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,965
supply chain, which costed around 12.

55
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,545
3 million annually.

56
00:03:34,045 --> 00:03:38,525
So we implemented a AI driven
predictive analytics and real time

57
00:03:38,525 --> 00:03:41,815
monitoring to improve decision
making and reduce downtime.

58
00:03:42,735 --> 00:03:48,735
The solution was to include predictive
analytics and also add monitoring which

59
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:54,035
can help in more insightful decision
making and can reduce the downtime.

60
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:59,355
The outcome were transforming 47
percent downtime reduction and 4.

61
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:03,945
2 million in annual savings
and a 52 percent improvement

62
00:04:03,985 --> 00:04:05,465
in supply chain reliability.

63
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:13,180
This use case or this global manufacturer
corporation case study demonstrates How

64
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,210
AI can drive a very miserable impact.

65
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,760
Now let's talk about the best practices.

66
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:24,130
So to replicate such a success,
consider these three best practices.

67
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,620
Access infrastructure regularly.

68
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,810
Evaluate your cloud setup to ensure it
aligns with evolving business needs.

69
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,120
It's not like one time setup is done
because we ever evolve our needs.

70
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,600
Then we need to access
infrastructure, whether it's meeting,

71
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,370
whether we need, more or less.

72
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,659
so we need, we should be accessing
the infrastructure regularly.

73
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,470
Then gradual migration strategies.

74
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,770
But if very huge enterprises,
This is the best approach.

75
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,850
Transition workloads incrementally to
reduce risk and maintain continuity.

76
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:04,470
Also define success metrics like
clear KPIs such as cost reduction,

77
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,340
system reliability, and uptime.

78
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,480
And measure and guide progress
and keep on doing that.

79
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,200
So all these three steps
keep on doing that regularly.

80
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,460
These steps provide a foundation
for scalable and efficient systems.

81
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,359
We have to be on top of this.

82
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:28,100
So make sure we are measuring and
guiding progress and taking benefit

83
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,960
of anything which is coming in future.

84
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,580
Let's talk about the integration strategy
like I was mentioning in the last slide.

85
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:41,329
So scaling AI requires a dynamic part
parameter adjustments, optimizing

86
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:45,770
performance for workloads ranging
from low to high demand, and then

87
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,490
robust monitoring frameworks.

88
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,230
Real time monitoring predictive
analytics for proactive uses.

89
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,840
And issue, proactive issue and resolution.

90
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,510
So this is one, also one of the
important factors to be considered.

91
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,820
Let's talk about continuous improvement
or continuous performance optimizations.

92
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:08,460
Leveraging AI to fine tune
systems for evolving requirements.

93
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,840
So such strategies maximize the potential
of any AI powered architectures.

94
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:20,325
Looking ahead, we see exciting trends,
looking ahead, we see exciting trends

95
00:06:20,345 --> 00:06:21,955
receiving the enterprise landscape.

96
00:06:22,455 --> 00:06:27,155
Quantum computing integration,
which involves the quantum 8 ML

97
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:31,195
models, will enhance computational
capabilities, bringing up to

98
00:06:31,195 --> 00:06:33,185
200 percent efficiency and gain.

99
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,705
So the future is really bright.

100
00:06:36,305 --> 00:06:38,445
Let's talk about multi
cloud orchestration.

101
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:42,805
This is happening even now, but in
the future it will be a seamless

102
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:45,925
collaboration across platforms,
which will improve operational

103
00:06:45,935 --> 00:06:49,315
efficiency even more by 95%, 94%.

104
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,775
And the edge computing revolution.

105
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:57,845
The real time data processing at the
edge will boost reliability to 99.

106
00:06:57,845 --> 00:07:00,275
99 percent enabling faster,
And smarter decision making.

107
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:05,005
These advancements will redefine
how any enterprise operation

108
00:07:05,005 --> 00:07:07,085
in the years is to come.

109
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:11,545
We are definitely looking forward
and, as I said, the future is

110
00:07:11,585 --> 00:07:13,334
looking really great in this.

111
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:18,275
And the trends are going to reshape
how any enterprise operations is

112
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:20,155
going to be in the many years to come.

113
00:07:20,655 --> 00:07:25,994
To summarize, AI powered cloud
architectures deliver 40 45

114
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:29,415
percent improvements in operational
efficiency, which is a huge.

115
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:35,935
And then 35 50 percent is in
cost reduction, 60 70 percent in

116
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,775
system reliability enhancements.

117
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:41,199
Like I said, this technology is
the largest one in the world.

118
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,530
Transformation.

119
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,890
They are more about empowerment
and driving business to innovate

120
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,360
and grow at the same time.

121
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,499
At Microsoft, we are committed to
