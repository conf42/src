00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:01,770
Hello all.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,080
Good morning, good
afternoon, good evening.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,760
I'm Shar and first of all, thank
you for joining this session.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,960
So today I will talk about how we can
achieve the reliability excellence

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,340
with SLO Management product.

6
00:00:14,995 --> 00:00:16,435
Let me introduce myself.

7
00:00:16,505 --> 00:00:19,445
I have a 12 plus years of IT experience.

8
00:00:19,445 --> 00:00:25,355
Currently I'm working with Naka software
as a DevOps and a platform lead, and

9
00:00:25,355 --> 00:00:30,795
I love to talk about DevSecOps Cloud
Engineering, SRE Platform Engineering.

10
00:00:31,485 --> 00:00:35,289
And I'm happy to connect with you
guys via the LinkedIn and the mail

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,319
that I have already put it here.

12
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,899
So let's start the session.

13
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:45,729
So the agenda of the today's session
is about the quick understanding of

14
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:48,419
the SREs the principles and practices.

15
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:52,695
Then we see what are the challenges
that we face for the SLOs in

16
00:00:52,695 --> 00:00:57,194
the complex environment and what
should be our approach to solve it.

17
00:00:57,825 --> 00:01:01,515
Then we look for the solution by
understanding the SLO management.

18
00:01:01,845 --> 00:01:03,945
Then we have and one use case.

19
00:01:03,995 --> 00:01:09,725
Here we see about to how we can
define the SLOs, and as well as we

20
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:12,815
check how we can basically measure
the reliability of the system.

21
00:01:13,445 --> 00:01:16,604
Then we'll look for the SLO
management products whatever

22
00:01:16,634 --> 00:01:17,715
available in the markets.

23
00:01:17,774 --> 00:01:22,294
And then we see some comparisons
in between those products.

24
00:01:22,744 --> 00:01:24,934
So let's start with the session.

25
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:30,979
So in, in SDLC that we know that
the developers want to go as fast.

26
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:35,069
Like they want to do a development
feature as fast as possible.

27
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:38,879
We are in parallel like
operation teams that they look

28
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,139
down to slow down the things.

29
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:43,289
They just, they want to
make a system reliable.

30
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:48,869
That's why this kind of a misalignment
happens in between these two teams

31
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:50,609
and it often create tensions.

32
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:53,609
So that's why the SRE
comes into the picture.

33
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,334
SRE.

34
00:01:54,579 --> 00:02:01,269
Is basically what introduced by the
Google in the early 2000 and it is useful

35
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:07,529
to basically measure the, and to solve
the operational challenges and issues.

36
00:02:07,809 --> 00:02:09,189
SRE, it's a job role.

37
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:16,049
It's a mindset, it's a set of metrics
that we used to measure and to manage

38
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,839
the overall system reliability.

39
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:20,739
So there are some key principles of SRE.

40
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:22,719
First is service level indicator.

41
00:02:22,749 --> 00:02:25,959
Service level indicator are the
metrics that used to measure

42
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:28,179
the quality of the service.

43
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,329
So there are the.

44
00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:32,924
Couple of different metrics.

45
00:02:32,974 --> 00:02:37,304
Mostly that we use is availability,
throughput, and the latency.

46
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:39,434
Then we have an service level.

47
00:02:39,434 --> 00:02:40,454
Objective service level.

48
00:02:40,454 --> 00:02:44,674
Objectives are the the target
level of that particular.

49
00:02:44,974 --> 00:02:45,544
Metrics.

50
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:51,374
Basically that the 99, 9 9% of
our system should be available.

51
00:02:51,374 --> 00:02:53,659
So this is a target
level that we set this.

52
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:56,584
So this is, SLO is for
the internal benchmarking.

53
00:02:57,004 --> 00:03:00,034
So SL is a goal rather than a promise.

54
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:02,989
But it is also help for the customers.

55
00:03:03,104 --> 00:03:09,734
That we define the specific metrics
and we have some kind of in shorty

56
00:03:09,734 --> 00:03:14,714
that our system would be available
up to this kind of a target so

57
00:03:14,714 --> 00:03:16,974
that we promise, to the customers.

58
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,584
Then we have an service level agreement.

59
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:23,624
So it's a contract between the end
users and the service provider.

60
00:03:24,074 --> 00:03:29,934
So if the the promises are the breaks,
so the service provider is need to pay or

61
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:36,514
they have some consequences are related,
to the different payments and they need to

62
00:03:37,174 --> 00:03:42,904
expansions of the different subscriptions,
then we have an error budget.

63
00:03:42,994 --> 00:03:47,924
But before moving to the error budget,
we need to understand that there is a

64
00:03:47,924 --> 00:03:52,494
misconception in the overall SRE one.

65
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:57,484
So the misconception is that we
always look for the a hundred

66
00:03:57,484 --> 00:03:59,574
percent of the system reliability.

67
00:03:59,869 --> 00:04:00,919
But not, this is not true.

68
00:04:01,249 --> 00:04:05,239
If you look for the a hundred percent
of system reliability, it means that

69
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:09,779
our system is available a hundred
percent and every time it should be up.

70
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,949
But that, that can't be a case, of
course in the practically your system.

71
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:19,634
Sometimes it would be down and some
kind of a disruption can be happen.

72
00:04:19,954 --> 00:04:23,484
And it also affect the overall
product lifecycle because if we.

73
00:04:24,084 --> 00:04:26,664
Go for the a hundred
percent of availability.

74
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:32,194
Then of course developers need to focus
on the reliability of the systems.

75
00:04:32,614 --> 00:04:35,214
They can't focus on the
feature development.

76
00:04:35,214 --> 00:04:38,154
They can't focus on the innovation side.

77
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:42,384
So that's why like the development teams
operation teams and the product teams

78
00:04:42,384 --> 00:04:45,694
they look to and to have the common.

79
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,754
Target level that need to be
set for the overall the system.

80
00:04:50,814 --> 00:04:53,304
So that's why error budget
comes into the picture.

81
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:59,164
Error budget is the it is just
unavailability of that of the particular

82
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:01,954
system that the teams can be tolerated.

83
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:08,069
Basically, so how much time that our
system could be unavailable and which

84
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:11,889
is fine for the overall, the life cycle.

85
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:12,709
That's why.

86
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:18,689
So when you have an advocate have
educate error budget, so it means you can

87
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:23,309
focus on the product development part,
but your error budget is threatened.

88
00:05:23,429 --> 00:05:25,109
It means that you need to focus.

89
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:29,799
On the SRE part of the
reliability of that system.

90
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:35,554
Then the caution is how we can
basically practice this principle,

91
00:05:35,554 --> 00:05:36,994
implement this principle.

92
00:05:36,994 --> 00:05:38,704
So we have a different kind of practices.

93
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:42,749
With the metrics monitoring alerts,
so of course if we look for the system

94
00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:47,394
reliability, so we have a proper defining
of the monitoring systems, we need to be,

95
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:49,654
have correct metrics for the services.

96
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:52,954
We need to be set the alerts for
the error budget, so if the error

97
00:05:52,954 --> 00:05:57,164
budget is threatened, so we can
have that alerts and we can focus

98
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,604
on the system reliability part.

99
00:05:59,174 --> 00:06:01,574
Then the demand forecasting
and capacity planning.

100
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:03,064
So we we, this is one.

101
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:08,869
A key practice where we have enough
resources available for the system

102
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,334
reliability part if something
happens so that the resources can

103
00:06:12,364 --> 00:06:17,134
focus on the improvement sites can
also focus on the reliability part.

104
00:06:17,184 --> 00:06:19,324
This is, one of the key practice.

105
00:06:19,774 --> 00:06:25,634
Then we have a change management and the
emergency response where the each teams,

106
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:30,414
like the development teams, operation
teams can should know about the overall

107
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:32,864
process defined for the change management.

108
00:06:33,294 --> 00:06:37,754
Like how if the change, if the, even
though change is small basically, so they

109
00:06:37,754 --> 00:06:40,994
should focus on like how we can basically.

110
00:06:41,474 --> 00:06:45,504
Overall do the changes and
it'll improve the overall

111
00:06:45,604 --> 00:06:48,179
reliability of the applications.

112
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:52,859
Then the emergency response, that
of course, in the practically if

113
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:56,759
you, you have a system sometimes
that the system would be down.

114
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:01,919
So you need to be like ready with
what kind of emergency comes.

115
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:02,129
So you.

116
00:07:02,609 --> 00:07:05,979
You need to be focused and you
need to be to work on that.

117
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:11,319
How early just you can like
back your system up and running.

118
00:07:11,859 --> 00:07:16,209
And then of course the culture and
to management is one of the one of

119
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:20,394
also the key practice where it is
operational workloads that how you manage.

120
00:07:20,784 --> 00:07:23,094
So in SREs of course there are.

121
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:24,814
Each and everything.

122
00:07:24,814 --> 00:07:25,894
You can't automate.

123
00:07:25,894 --> 00:07:29,704
So there are such kind of a manual
practices that you need to be

124
00:07:29,704 --> 00:07:34,044
followed and accordingly, you
need to be manage that overall of

125
00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:35,844
your operational workloads part.

126
00:07:36,604 --> 00:07:37,024
These are the.

127
00:07:37,994 --> 00:07:41,564
Some kind of a basic
understanding of an SRE one.

128
00:07:41,864 --> 00:07:46,125
Now, let's move to the what are
the challenges that you faced

129
00:07:46,224 --> 00:07:48,415
of as o for the complex system?

130
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:52,935
So here, the complex system means it,
it could be your microservices base,

131
00:07:52,935 --> 00:07:54,755
it could be your distributed system.

132
00:07:55,145 --> 00:07:57,695
So let understanding the
problem, what is a problem.

133
00:07:58,235 --> 00:08:02,005
So sometimes what happens when
we, like to define an SLOs

134
00:08:02,005 --> 00:08:03,685
for the complex environment.

135
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,595
We SLOs are not aligned
with the business goal.

136
00:08:06,595 --> 00:08:10,075
It means that the
priorities are misalignment.

137
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:16,855
Like we, we focus the SLOs on the focus
on the different metrics, but our business

138
00:08:16,885 --> 00:08:19,135
goals needed a different kind of metrics.

139
00:08:19,135 --> 00:08:20,215
So this is the.

140
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,680
One thing and the target
level is also changed.

141
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,790
This is the one challenge we face
with the system as well as we mostly

142
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:34,270
don't look focus on the data driven
approach because if we define the

143
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,720
SLOs we also need to be, ensure that
what are the previous, checks for the

144
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,640
data and accordingly we can measure it
and define the SLOs for the systems.

145
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:51,150
And sometimes we, our, the SLOs
have we just set unrealistic SLOs.

146
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,735
And the other KPIs are
the completely different.

147
00:08:54,735 --> 00:09:00,135
And so we need to be, understand the
system first and accordingly we can set

148
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:02,625
the realistic approach for that systems.

149
00:09:03,315 --> 00:09:06,845
Then of course the distributed
systems and interdependencies.

150
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:10,745
If we have a distributed systems,
multiple microservices and APIs

151
00:09:10,745 --> 00:09:13,805
and one microservices dependent
on the other service, and they

152
00:09:13,805 --> 00:09:16,475
have some other interdependencies.

153
00:09:16,715 --> 00:09:20,205
It is it is really difficult
to find out the pinpoint of

154
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,185
where the SLOs is violated.

155
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:28,135
So this is the also one of the challenge
we faced in this kind of environments.

156
00:09:28,825 --> 00:09:30,985
And we don't look on
the priority components.

157
00:09:31,015 --> 00:09:34,515
It means that according to the
system, we need to be define

158
00:09:34,515 --> 00:09:37,245
it, what exactly user is doing.

159
00:09:37,575 --> 00:09:40,395
So we need to be look for
the, their user journey.

160
00:09:40,395 --> 00:09:44,145
And accordingly we need to be
center priorities of the system.

161
00:09:44,205 --> 00:09:47,085
And then we can define an SLOs as well.

162
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:52,405
And, of course the tool limitations
is there, whatever the tools we have.

163
00:09:52,455 --> 00:09:55,865
So we have the limited capabilities
with respect to that tool.

164
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,295
So that is also one challenge.

165
00:09:58,595 --> 00:10:01,535
And at the end, of course, the
dynamic and evolving systems.

166
00:10:01,705 --> 00:10:05,985
We work in the agile environment
our system is also upscales.

167
00:10:05,985 --> 00:10:09,575
We are also upgrades and we work
on the continuous deployment.

168
00:10:09,605 --> 00:10:13,455
So we always have the
new features comes in.

169
00:10:13,455 --> 00:10:18,215
So accordingly, we need to be again,
set the SLOs as per the changes.

170
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,160
So these are some kind
of a c cha challenges.

171
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,790
So what should be our approach
to solve this kind of issue?

172
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,640
So first is we need to be
understand the system correctly.

173
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:32,080
Like what, what is particular system, what
are the different services in the system?

174
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,290
What is the.

175
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,840
User is doing like in
your day to day activity.

176
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,920
So the critical user journeys also
need to be understand of that.

177
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,200
Then we can go with the designing
part how we can define design and SLOs

178
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,550
of that part of critical services.

179
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,070
And then we can set metrics.

180
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:51,805
For that.

181
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:56,095
And then at the end, of course,
how we can use it effectively.

182
00:10:56,395 --> 00:11:02,555
That, that is the one approach that
accordingly we can move it and we can try

183
00:11:02,555 --> 00:11:05,505
to solve this complex issues for that.

184
00:11:05,985 --> 00:11:06,285
But.

185
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:11,475
The question is what would be our
actual solution for this issue?

186
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:15,015
The solution is the service
level objective management.

187
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:19,285
SLO management it's cover, it's
a lifecycle that we need to be

188
00:11:19,285 --> 00:11:21,265
defined within our organization.

189
00:11:21,805 --> 00:11:25,915
So it involves basically to
define the OS by aligning the.

190
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:31,670
User journey with the business objectives,
whatever the business goals we have.

191
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,370
So accordingly, we need to be,
define the user journey first.

192
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:40,600
Then set a realistic target for the KPI
like the uptime, latencies and error rate.

193
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:45,870
So that is the one of the key
practice that we need to be do.

194
00:11:46,385 --> 00:11:50,745
Then we have a a different like
SLOs, like the composite SLOs.

195
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:54,335
So composite SLOs is basically
a combination of individual

196
00:11:55,265 --> 00:11:56,345
SLOs that we define it.

197
00:11:56,585 --> 00:12:02,735
So if we look to measure the liability
of a complete system, so we need a

198
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:04,595
holistic view of that particular system.

199
00:12:04,635 --> 00:12:08,295
Composite Aslu comes into the
picture in that case where.

200
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,940
We have individual SLOs
for the different services.

201
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:16,630
And basically aggregation of
that services that SLOs is is

202
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,100
made to create a composite SLOs.

203
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,590
And at the end the correct measuring
and the monitoring of system is

204
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:26,480
needed where we are defined the
correct alerts for the budgets.

205
00:12:26,525 --> 00:12:29,885
And the monitoring of the complete system.

206
00:12:30,465 --> 00:12:34,775
So what benefits we can get of
course the overall system liabilities

207
00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:36,615
and performance would be improved.

208
00:12:36,985 --> 00:12:38,455
We have a less downtime.

209
00:12:38,515 --> 00:12:40,489
We have a less incidents.

210
00:12:40,489 --> 00:12:42,794
We have a less priority issues on that.

211
00:12:43,244 --> 00:12:45,284
If we focus on the data driven that.

212
00:12:45,494 --> 00:12:47,684
That we have already discussed before.

213
00:12:48,044 --> 00:12:52,104
So the data driven decision making is
one of the key factors to prioritize

214
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,884
improvement because if you look for
the previous data to understand the

215
00:12:55,884 --> 00:12:58,924
system better on that one and then.

216
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:02,909
Cost to the proactive
monitoring of the systems.

217
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:08,009
So it'll also reduce the meantime
recovery of the system as well.

218
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:12,269
And communications and
collaborations within a team as well.

219
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:17,874
It'll also help to share the understanding
for the overall reliability process.

220
00:13:18,034 --> 00:13:20,474
Then we have a customer
satisfaction of course.

221
00:13:20,804 --> 00:13:25,584
Why overall by defining this
practices and process, and we focus

222
00:13:25,614 --> 00:13:27,984
on the innovation part on that.

223
00:13:28,914 --> 00:13:31,359
Now, let's see understand
the use case of that.

224
00:13:31,869 --> 00:13:36,889
This is a simple like the product
lifecycle of a user journey.

225
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:42,689
Yeah, the user is to go into
the shopping app and they just

226
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:43,914
put some product into the cart.

227
00:13:44,349 --> 00:13:45,759
And do the payment.

228
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:50,129
And after that overall the backend
process comes, whereas the warehouse

229
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:55,319
that received it and dispatched orders
then invoicing happens and the user

230
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:57,144
get the confirmation via the mail.

231
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:00,859
So overall, this journey,
let's break into the two parts.

232
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:04,919
So first is the pre-purchase,
and second is the post-purchase.

233
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:07,809
So in the so in the pre-purchase the.

234
00:14:08,219 --> 00:14:13,179
The first, we understand that the
user part is that that the put the

235
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:16,874
products overall, the per repurchase
system should be available.

236
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:20,259
And user has just purchased the product.

237
00:14:20,619 --> 00:14:25,119
So the availability of the overall,
the pre-purchase system is needed, and

238
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:27,549
of course the payment of the system.

239
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:30,879
And then the secondary
part is a post-purchase.

240
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:34,419
So the availability is the more
important than the latency.

241
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:35,609
This is the one thing.

242
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:41,039
Of the system and the services are in
the pre-purchase order are the more

243
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:43,589
important than the post-purchase start.

244
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:48,899
So in the po, in the pre-purchase website,
availability is a slightly more than

245
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:50,719
the payment availability, of course.

246
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:55,919
Because the, if the website is not
available, so user can't go and

247
00:14:56,189 --> 00:15:01,379
purchase the part, and then the
payment part availability is needed.

248
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:06,149
So accordingly from this user journey,
so this, we need to be defined it

249
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:09,689
which are the critical components,
which are the critical services.

250
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:12,089
And which are the services.

251
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:16,189
And accordingly, we need to be to find
the matters metrics for that services.

252
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:19,459
And then at the end, pulling
the post purchase, of course,

253
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:21,319
the warehouse and the invoicing.

254
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:24,799
Slightly more important than the emailing.

255
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:30,439
If you will get the email after sometimes,
then of course that, that would be fine.

256
00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:35,669
But your order should be dispatched
and you will have the invoicing is

257
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:39,989
also we should be created then after
sometimes the, if you get an email.

258
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:40,829
That is fine.

259
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,579
So the thing is like that, how
we can measure the reliability

260
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:45,779
of this complete user journey.

261
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:47,759
First is identify the services.

262
00:15:48,444 --> 00:15:50,274
And their dependent components.

263
00:15:50,334 --> 00:15:52,754
So from according to this user journey.

264
00:15:52,754 --> 00:15:56,474
So we have a store website,
we have a payment, invoices,

265
00:15:56,474 --> 00:15:57,764
emailing and warehousing.

266
00:15:57,764 --> 00:16:00,944
So these are a services
that we have identified it.

267
00:16:01,424 --> 00:16:04,814
Then we will set up the
individual SLOs for each service.

268
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:08,884
With respect to the different metrics
like the availabilities and latency.

269
00:16:09,434 --> 00:16:13,934
And based on the understanding, we
will define the composite SLO part,

270
00:16:14,024 --> 00:16:18,314
like the pre-purchase user experience
and the post-purchase user experience.

271
00:16:18,974 --> 00:16:21,819
And at the end we will
look for the composite slo.

272
00:16:21,859 --> 00:16:26,029
As I said, composite SLOs are the
aggregations would be about to.

273
00:16:26,449 --> 00:16:31,439
So we have, the pre-purchase user journeys
and post-purchase user journeys and

274
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:37,699
aggregation would help to make the to
understand the overall system reliability.

275
00:16:38,349 --> 00:16:43,529
This is the simple use case of of
the overall reliability process.

276
00:16:44,524 --> 00:16:49,899
Then we have the SLO management
products who can help you to define it.

277
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,619
The SLO management lifecycle.

278
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:56,369
It also help you to give
you the good features.

279
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,959
It would also give you the
features like the composite os that

280
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:02,389
also give you the user journey.

281
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:03,999
In this overall product.

282
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:09,059
The HA and Nobel nine are the, I will
say, the leaders in that because they have

283
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:14,264
the such kind of different, features were
like the composite solo part, like the

284
00:17:14,264 --> 00:17:17,024
user journey part, even in the harness.

285
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,754
It is a complete 360 degree platform.

286
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:24,074
It also give you the specific
feature for the service reliability

287
00:17:24,074 --> 00:17:26,924
management in which we can analyze it.

288
00:17:26,924 --> 00:17:33,894
We can easily gather to know how, why the,
our system is getting failed and it also

289
00:17:33,964 --> 00:17:38,834
help you to to set up the governance with
the open policy agents where the noble

290
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:45,154
line is also help you to keep the three
years of old data so you can have the

291
00:17:45,154 --> 00:17:51,364
previous data to understand your system
and accordingly you can make a decision.

292
00:17:51,784 --> 00:17:57,934
It has a good composite feature
part and it also have to define

293
00:17:57,934 --> 00:17:59,044
the user critical journey.

294
00:17:59,314 --> 00:18:04,174
Then we have some other tools like the
fire head end Scott Car, ServiceNow,

295
00:18:04,174 --> 00:18:08,379
new Relic, which is just, fit it
under the monitoring part incident

296
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:12,769
management part, but it is not a
specific SLO management product.

297
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:15,539
These are some products
well in the market.

298
00:18:15,989 --> 00:18:21,109
And now there are, like, I have done
some the comparison on the basis of

299
00:18:21,109 --> 00:18:25,649
the different capabilities like the
real time error budgeting tricks and

300
00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:27,959
map SLOs to business capabilities.

301
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:29,450
And RCA.

302
00:18:30,364 --> 00:18:33,764
And of course, the customized
dashboards and reports help you.

303
00:18:34,249 --> 00:18:39,269
And of course the automation part auditing
parts and the overall, the customized

304
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:41,159
visas with respect to the business.

305
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:45,109
You can see they have some
tools, have some capabilities.

306
00:18:45,109 --> 00:18:46,759
Some are good in the specific.

307
00:18:46,814 --> 00:18:50,934
Features, some are like fit
under the complete category.

308
00:18:50,984 --> 00:18:55,814
So the harness is mostly the noble
line is there, so accordingly you can

309
00:18:55,814 --> 00:18:57,554
choose it, whatever the requirement.

310
00:18:57,584 --> 00:19:02,604
And you can just use the overall
features of that products.

311
00:19:02,854 --> 00:19:04,384
This is for this session.

312
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:08,494
So thank you very much
for joining this session.

313
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:10,839
Thank you everyone.
