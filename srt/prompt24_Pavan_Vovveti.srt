14
00:00:43,715 --> 00:00:45,864
So a little bit background of myself.

15
00:00:46,615 --> 00:00:51,515
I'm a technology professional with over
15 years of experience in SDLC, the

16
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:57,835
software development lifecycle, various

17
00:00:57,895 --> 00:01:00,755
management, across diverse industries.

18
00:01:01,025 --> 00:01:04,505
Academically, I hold a master's
degree in computer science from

19
00:01:04,515 --> 00:01:06,165
Staffordshire University, UK.

20
00:01:06,665 --> 00:01:11,655
My, my expertise lies in blending
robust security measures with

21
00:01:12,265 --> 00:01:14,485
cutting edge development practices.

22
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,870
10 years of focused
experience in security.

23
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:24,760
I've been last 10 years in security,
API audit, cybersecurity related

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,770
initiatives, working, as a, as an
architect or principal engineer.

25
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,650
Thank you.

26
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,980
Let's talk about the introduction to
IOT integrations, the importance of

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,720
third party integrations, key security
challenges, securing IOT integrations

28
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,890
by authentication and authorization.

29
00:01:44,535 --> 00:01:49,315
Securing communications in IoT
ecosystems, data privacy and

30
00:01:49,325 --> 00:01:50,595
security across the life cycle.

31
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:53,935
Mitigation strategies and best practices.

32
00:01:54,855 --> 00:01:58,015
One case study, if you have
time, and then conclusion.

33
00:01:58,515 --> 00:02:01,515
So introduction to IoT and
third party integrations.

34
00:02:02,405 --> 00:02:03,585
What is IoT?

35
00:02:03,755 --> 00:02:08,395
So IoT refers to the interconnection
of devices, enabling data exchange

36
00:02:08,415 --> 00:02:10,685
and automation across various domains.

37
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:13,060
What are the key stacks in iot?

38
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,555
The cellular iot connections reach
3.4 billion and are projected

39
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:20,075
to reach 75 billion by 2025.

40
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:26,255
Highlighting the massive scale of iot,
what are the challenges By, in Ivo t

41
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:28,715
with a rapid, growth and development.

42
00:02:29,295 --> 00:02:33,550
Integrating third party services
is main challenge and for the

43
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:38,590
functionality, but introduces
security vulnerabilities, mainly.

44
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,310
Accessing the data, data
privacy, must manage carefully.

45
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,910
These are the main challenges.

46
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,660
Let's talk about the benefits of third
party integration, the importance

47
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,230
of third party integrations.

48
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,870
What are the benefits?

49
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,380
The third party integrations unlock.

50
00:02:55,995 --> 00:03:00,825
enhanced features, reduce costs
and increase efficiency so that we

51
00:03:00,825 --> 00:03:02,215
don't need to reinvent the wheel.

52
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:06,735
We can utilize the already existing
software application available

53
00:03:06,745 --> 00:03:10,405
in the market, the best optimized
frameworks which are available.

54
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:13,705
We can utilize that by integrating
the third party integrations.

55
00:03:14,205 --> 00:03:18,055
The specialized services help solve
complex problems such as real time

56
00:03:18,055 --> 00:03:22,655
data analysis and directive maintenance
applications across sectors.

57
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:27,415
Smart cities integrate traffic
management, public safety, and

58
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,215
resource optimization systems.

59
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:35,205
Mainly healthcare use remote monitoring,
wearable health devices, and predictive

60
00:03:35,205 --> 00:03:38,245
analytics for patient monitoring systems.

61
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:44,145
Mobility implement smart traffic
solutions, optimize public transit

62
00:03:44,335 --> 00:03:47,475
routes, and improve fleet management.

63
00:03:47,975 --> 00:03:51,015
What are the key security
challenges in IoT integrations?

64
00:03:51,435 --> 00:03:53,295
Scalability is the main challenge.

65
00:03:53,295 --> 00:03:58,010
Microsoft As IOT ecosystems grow,
managing billions of connected

66
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,720
devices becomes increasingly complex.

67
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,780
The security vulnerabilities.

68
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,830
Integrating third party services
expands the attack surface.

69
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:11,650
We don't know what software they use,
what is the open source softwares

70
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,600
or what are the libraries they use.

71
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:18,590
So that increases when we integrate the
third party services into our ecosystem.

72
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,000
That increases the security vulnerability.

73
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,945
Risks include data breaches, unauthorized
access, and There are scenarios

74
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:33,585
where a third party application is
integrated into our databases or the

75
00:04:33,585 --> 00:04:38,605
servers where the breach happened
into the third party service, which

76
00:04:38,605 --> 00:04:42,715
eventually attacked our data servers
through the third party application.

77
00:04:43,355 --> 00:04:49,375
Data privacy concerns, IoT platforms
handle sensitive data, making data

78
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:54,155
protection critical to maintaining
trust and compliance with regulations.

79
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,605
Securing iot integrations.

80
00:04:56,925 --> 00:05:00,465
So how are we going to secure
these IO OT integrations,

81
00:05:00,765 --> 00:05:02,565
authentication and authorization?

82
00:05:02,565 --> 00:05:06,345
How are we going to achieve these
authentication and authorization

83
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:08,565
authentication mechanisms?

84
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:13,300
Mainly multi-factor authentication
requires multiple forms of verification.

85
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,725
Adding an extra layer of security so we
can enable a multi-factor or two-factor

86
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:23,045
authentication to authenticate any user.

87
00:05:23,675 --> 00:05:27,365
to come into our ecosystem,
our software application.

88
00:05:27,845 --> 00:05:33,275
Token based authentication is main,
one of the, one of the prominent

89
00:05:33,295 --> 00:05:38,685
way of authentication, for the user
to authenticate, JSON web tokens,

90
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:43,355
which are JWT provide a stateless
scalable solution for authentication.

91
00:05:44,015 --> 00:05:46,145
What are the authorization
protocols available?

92
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,675
OAuth2, OpenID Connect.

93
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,900
These are the widely used secure
authorization role based access controls

94
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,580
Attribute based access controls and
there are relation based access controls

95
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:04,059
as well securing communications in iot
ecosystems how are we going to secure?

96
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:10,630
communication in between the channels
or in between the systems or in between

97
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:17,080
the third party systems and other vendor
systems encryption methods What are the

98
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,850
encryption methods available to ensure
data confidentiality with the robot?

99
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,560
So Aus 2 56 encryption
end-to-end encryption, which

100
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,990
protects data from device to the
cloud throughout its journey.

101
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:37,040
Secure protocols is one of the, is
one of the method by using the HGT p.

102
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:43,070
S Mandatory for secure web communications
for any API APIs communication.

103
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,450
We can use the HGT PS.

104
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,900
And MQTT over TLS, a lightweight secure
communication protocol for IoT devices.

105
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,939
And COAP over DTLS used for
resource constrained devices.

106
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,469
So how are we going to
prevent the data manipulation?

107
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:03,789
Use VPNs to secure communications
and prevent data interception.

108
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:09,910
Implement digital signatures, digital
certs, and message authentication codes,

109
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,420
which are MACs for data integrating.

110
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,230
what are the data privacy and
security across the lifecycle?

111
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,890
the data lifecycle, the data
security lifecycle, mainly

112
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:28,729
consists of seven stages, which
are capture, store, analysis, use,

113
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:32,120
and then publish, archive, punch.

114
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,950
The lifecycle stage is
mainly on collection.

115
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,239
the collection use secure boot
mechanisms and authenticate APIs.

116
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:47,150
The transmission, Encrypt all data using
industry standard methods, storage, store

117
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:52,460
data in encrypted databases with strict
access controls, deletion, use secure

118
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,180
deletion methods such as crypto shredding
to ensure data cannot be recovered.

119
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,719
What are the mitigation strategies
and best practices available?

120
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:05,429
The API security, like we talked
about the API communication

121
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,229
by using the JSON web tokens.

122
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:12,499
OAuth2, OpenID, multi factor
authentication by using these

123
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:17,469
implements by implementing these strong
authentication and authorization and rate

124
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:20,429
limiting and monitoring API activity.

125
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:23,079
So what is the rate limiting?

126
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:28,829
So any API to API connected
communication happening to any gateway.

127
00:08:29,329 --> 00:08:34,849
We can configure at gateway level, the
rate limit, how many transactions per

128
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:42,259
second, the backend API is allowed,
or we can configure, the max number so

129
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:44,609
that we can monitor the API activity.

130
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:48,809
If that max number is increases,
we can set up the alerts, warnings,

131
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:54,939
and, and the, configuration at
greater than 5 percent of my max.

132
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,099
Thanks.

133
00:08:55,739 --> 00:09:02,609
Give us a warning or distributed email so
that products production operations team

134
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:07,680
members are, tier one people can go and
monitor why it is happening, what made,

135
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:13,840
what is the main factor, the root cause
of these all of a sudden peak activity

136
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:19,990
for this API traffic, the access controls
enforce the principle of least privilege

137
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,900
and review access rights regularly.

138
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:21,919
Okay.

139
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:26,289
The case study, the smart standard
overview, there is a smart city project

140
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:29,969
in Spain involving 20, 000 IoT devices.

141
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:31,849
What are the key integrations they did?

142
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:36,909
They did environmental monitoring,
sensors measure air quality and noise

143
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:41,509
levels, smart parking sensors of
mobile operators, traffic condition,

144
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:46,199
traffic management, adaptive control
systems, optimized traffic flow.

145
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,179
The results.

146
00:09:48,144 --> 00:09:51,854
20 percent reduction in pollution
levels, 25 percent decrease

147
00:09:51,854 --> 00:09:53,584
in parking related congestion.

148
00:09:54,334 --> 00:09:59,414
The challenges solutions for this city
project, scalability, hierarchical network

149
00:09:59,414 --> 00:10:04,794
architecture, interoperability, support
for multiple protocols and standards.

150
00:10:05,254 --> 00:10:08,394
Security and privacy, end
to end encryption, and data

151
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,444
anonymization they achieved.

152
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:11,854
So the conclusion.

153
00:10:12,354 --> 00:10:16,564
The future of IoT integration promises
to be transformative, driven by

154
00:10:16,564 --> 00:10:21,124
emerging technologies such as 5G, edge
intelligence, and quantum safe encryption.

155
00:10:21,624 --> 00:10:25,624
So organizations must be proactive,
embracing a balance between innovation

156
00:10:25,764 --> 00:10:30,464
and security, while adhering to
stringent data protection laws.

157
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:37,474
So there is a balance the balance between
the functionality Versus the security

158
00:10:38,384 --> 00:10:40,564
that's the main goal of this talk.

159
00:10:40,924 --> 00:10:44,054
Thank you for listening to
me I hope this will help.

160
00:10:44,614 --> 00:10:45,004
Thank you.

161
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:45,694
See you again
