00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,309
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:04,160
Thank you for being here today.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,300
Before we dive in, let me
quickly introduce myself.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:13,960
My name is Di Duran and I'm a technical
architect with over 15 years of experience

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,690
in IT industry, including the last 10
years, focused specifically on aviation

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,290
technology over the past decade.

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:27,310
I have had the opportunity to work closely
on large scale digital transformation

8
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:33,269
projects within the aviation sector,
particularly in areas like predictive

9
00:00:33,269 --> 00:00:38,069
maintenance, aircraft system integration,
and data driven operational optimization.

10
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:41,455
Through this work, I've seen
how the industry is evolving.

11
00:00:41,955 --> 00:00:47,084
Moving from traditional reactive
maintenance models toward smarter

12
00:00:47,084 --> 00:00:50,804
predictive systems that leverage
real time data and machine learning.

13
00:00:51,304 --> 00:00:55,144
One of the most powerful enablers
of this shift is digital twin

14
00:00:55,144 --> 00:00:58,694
technology, and that's exactly
what we will be focusing today,

15
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:01,024
how digital twins are driving.

16
00:01:01,459 --> 00:01:05,770
The next revolution in aircraft
observability, modern aircraft

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:12,400
generates more than 200,000 data
points and up to 1.2 terabytes of

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,230
operational data every single day.

19
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,485
That's a huge data.

20
00:01:15,985 --> 00:01:19,405
That's a massive opportunity
and also a challenge.

21
00:01:19,905 --> 00:01:24,855
Digital twin technology unlocks
that data's potential by creating

22
00:01:24,855 --> 00:01:27,555
virtual replicas of aircraft systems.

23
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:33,455
These twins monitor, simulate and
predict aircraft health with failure

24
00:01:33,455 --> 00:01:36,215
prediction accuracy of 97.3 percentage.

25
00:01:37,205 --> 00:01:41,645
That's not a science fiction
that is happening now and today

26
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:43,145
I will show you how this works.

27
00:01:43,925 --> 00:01:48,365
What benefits it brings and
how industries beyond aviations

28
00:01:48,695 --> 00:01:50,465
are adopting the same tool.

29
00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:54,984
Let's begin with what makes
digital twins so powerful.

30
00:01:55,484 --> 00:01:57,070
First, complete visibility.

31
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,489
Digital twins replicates the full aircraft
environment providing observability

32
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,229
across every component, like mechanical,
electrical, and environmental.

33
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:09,769
Next one is predictive analysis.

34
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:14,920
Twins can identify failure pattern
28 days in advance, which gives

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,365
maintenance team a long runway to
address issues before they escalate.

36
00:02:20,865 --> 00:02:22,875
System integration is key.

37
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:28,325
Twins correlate data from thousands of
SOS into one unified operational picture.

38
00:02:28,825 --> 00:02:33,075
Finally, real-time monitoring These
systems continuously process telemetry

39
00:02:33,795 --> 00:02:39,510
data throughout the entire flight
phase, not just during inspection.

40
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:46,519
This combination of depth integration
and immediacy is what sets digital twins

41
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:48,799
Apart from traditional monitoring system,

42
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:55,230
the impact of unified absorbability
is measurable, dramatic.

43
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:02,090
Digital twins reduce the mean time to
detect issues by nearly 90 percentage.

44
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,049
That is faster identification of problem.

45
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,980
Meantime to resolve drops over 76.

46
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:14,140
Percentage meaning issues are not only
detected sooner, but resolve faster.

47
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,160
There is a 61.8 percentage reduction
in emergency maintenance, and perhaps

48
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:26,220
more significantly that is an 84.6
percentage decrease in a OG events,

49
00:03:26,369 --> 00:03:28,830
which are extremely costly disruptions.

50
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:34,400
This shift from fragmented
monitoring systems to unified

51
00:03:34,405 --> 00:03:38,435
digital twin platform creates this
kind of operational efficiency.

52
00:03:38,935 --> 00:03:43,975
So how do digital twins
get such deep insights?

53
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:50,420
It starts with multimodal telemetry,
vibration analysis, which uses high

54
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:57,075
frequency sensors to detect tiny
deviations down to 0.05 millimeter, often

55
00:03:57,085 --> 00:03:59,155
indicating early stage bearing wear.

56
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:05,235
At a 20 K kilohertz sampling rate,
no subtile vibration goes unnoticed.

57
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:11,075
Thermal imaging monitors temperature
patterns, identifying electrical falls

58
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:18,335
or fluid leaks with 0.1 degree Celsius
resolution and full spectrum analysis.

59
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:21,820
We catch problems that
traditional sensors miss.

60
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,660
Acoustic monitoring brings in sound.

61
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,730
AI algorithms analyze
frequencies beyond human hearing.

62
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:36,110
With ultrasonic detection and pattern
matching anomalies are identified well

63
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,465
before they become audible or dangerous.

64
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:42,175
All this data, vibration, heat sound.

65
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:49,000
Are fused by advanced algorithms
to create one unified signal even

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,550
when individual sensors look normal.

67
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,890
These algorithms can detect combined
patterns that indicates future failure.

68
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:03,975
Let's look at three examples that
prove power of digital twins.

69
00:05:04,475 --> 00:05:08,705
A major European carrier
implemented digital twins

70
00:05:08,765 --> 00:05:12,215
across 137 aircraft in one year.

71
00:05:12,455 --> 00:05:16,985
They saw a 93 percentage drop in
unexpected component failures.

72
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:22,175
They prevented 18 flight
cancellation by catching early

73
00:05:22,175 --> 00:05:23,705
signs of fuel bump detection.

74
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:31,445
Which is approximately save over 4.3
million Euro in a OG cost and North

75
00:05:31,445 --> 00:05:36,065
American cargo operator integrated
engine and system monitoring.

76
00:05:37,055 --> 00:05:41,885
Despite legacy integration cha
challenges, they reduced maintenance

77
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:47,105
cost by 23 percentage and extended
component life by 14 percentage.

78
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:52,735
An Asian regional airline used
a digital twins to detect a PU

79
00:05:52,735 --> 00:06:00,275
failure patent 21 days earlier than
traditional systems with AR guided

80
00:06:00,275 --> 00:06:02,705
repairs and predictive part management.

81
00:06:02,915 --> 00:06:06,750
They cut maintenance turnaround
time by 42 percentage.

82
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:13,060
No matter the size or region,
digital twins are delivering

83
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,590
measurable, written off investment
and operational improvement.

84
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:22,045
Digital twins observability
relies not just sensor.

85
00:06:22,545 --> 00:06:27,725
But also intelligent architecture
onboard its computing allows raw data

86
00:06:27,725 --> 00:06:30,245
to be processed on the aircraft itself.

87
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:36,365
Even in mid-flight, these distributed
nodes can detect anomal immediately.

88
00:06:36,865 --> 00:06:42,505
Data filtering algorithms reduce
transmission by 87 percentage only

89
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:44,425
the most relevant data gets sent.

90
00:06:45,235 --> 00:06:46,195
Saving bandwidth.

91
00:06:46,735 --> 00:06:51,645
And avoiding Overloads Secure
Transmission System uses multi-channel

92
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:58,045
communication for resiliency for cloud
integration, which enables fleet wide data

93
00:06:58,045 --> 00:07:01,010
aggregation and analyze on the ground.

94
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:06,670
This edge to cloud architecture en
enables continuous observability.

95
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,300
Even in remote environments
or during connectivity gaps,

96
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,235
digital twins data becomes even
more powerful when made with

97
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:18,355
visual through augmented reality.

98
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:23,805
Failure probability mapping uses
historical and real time data to

99
00:07:23,805 --> 00:07:25,965
create component specific risk maps.

100
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:28,965
Technicians knows exactly where to look.

101
00:07:29,465 --> 00:07:34,715
Visual translations, which converts
complex analytics into simple overlays.

102
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:37,075
No need to interpret drought data.

103
00:07:37,575 --> 00:07:43,035
AR procedure guidance provides
interactive repair man manuals

104
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:48,320
or instructions directly in the
technician's field of view, which

105
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,360
reduce error rates by 76.2 percentage.

106
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,170
These tools have cut maintenance.

107
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,580
By over 34 percentage.

108
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,660
While improving consistency and
quality, technicians are no longer

109
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,640
reacting, they are anticipated.

110
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,730
As with any advanced technology,
there are challenges.

111
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:13,505
Data accuracy must exceed 98.7 percentage.

112
00:08:14,005 --> 00:08:16,105
Recurs constant calibration.

113
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:21,295
A small sensor drift can lead to
a false alert or missed problem.

114
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:23,445
Legacy integration is complex.

115
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:29,805
Most airlines uses over 14
plus different legacy systems.

116
00:08:30,255 --> 00:08:32,190
Many built decades ago.

117
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,045
APIs and middleware become
essentials to unify the ecosystem.

118
00:08:37,545 --> 00:08:39,405
Telemetry flight is tough.

119
00:08:40,335 --> 00:08:47,105
Extreme temperatures and vibrations
with demand, redundant sensors

120
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:52,735
and advanced error correction to
maintain data fidelity, but by

121
00:08:53,155 --> 00:08:57,210
tracking these heads on airlines
achieve faster return of investment

122
00:08:57,415 --> 00:08:58,975
and greater long-term reliability.

123
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:03,290
Implementing digital twins is
not an overnight process, but

124
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,100
it can be phased strategically.

125
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,250
Assessment phase start by evaluating
existing systems and data gaps.

126
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,600
Prioritize systems with
the highest failure impact.

127
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,310
Data foundation, deploy the
sensors, build storage, and

128
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,800
standardize acquisition protocols.

129
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,155
Ensure the data integrity from the start

130
00:09:29,655 --> 00:09:34,300
twin development, which creates
model of critical system.

131
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,580
Train them.

132
00:09:36,405 --> 00:09:42,595
Historical data and integrate AI
and operational expansion scale

133
00:09:42,595 --> 00:09:45,985
to full aircraft and integrate
with maintenance systems.

134
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:53,225
The total implementation takes 18
to 24 months, but many airlines see

135
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:58,020
early written of investment within
seven to nine months long before.

136
00:09:58,775 --> 00:10:00,305
The full rollout is complete.

137
00:10:00,805 --> 00:10:06,975
What's exciting is that aviation now
influencing other in industries in power

138
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:12,275
generation turbines are monitored with
the same techniques used in engines,

139
00:10:13,175 --> 00:10:17,525
which is delivering 93.6 percentage
prediction accuracy and cutting

140
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:19,655
unplanned outages by 42 percentage.

141
00:10:20,155 --> 00:10:25,435
In medical equipment, digital twins
predicts scanner maintenance needs,

142
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:31,785
which is reducing scan cancellation
by 71.8 percentage in manufacturing

143
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:38,005
production lines, uses predictive
analytics to detect processors, which is

144
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:41,215
reducing defects by over 37 percentage.

145
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:46,185
The reliability and safety standards
pioneered in aviation are now being

146
00:10:46,215 --> 00:10:50,775
applied to industries where uptime
is critical, and failure is costly.

147
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:54,035
Let's wrap up with some key takeaways.

148
00:10:54,535 --> 00:11:00,145
Digital twins deliver transformational
observability with 97.3

149
00:11:00,145 --> 00:11:01,975
percentage predictive accuracy.

150
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:05,265
Integration is the linchpin.

151
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:11,305
Success requires bridging a legacy system,
but the written off investment is real.

152
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:16,675
With an 84.6 percentage reduction
in a OG events, the investment

153
00:11:16,705 --> 00:11:18,355
pays for itself quickly.

154
00:11:18,855 --> 00:11:22,755
Looking ahead, technologies
like quantum computing.

155
00:11:23,255 --> 00:11:30,305
And next gen Mission learning will push
prediction accuracy to 99.8 percentage.

156
00:11:30,805 --> 00:11:35,545
We also expect broader standardization
with organizations like airing,

157
00:11:36,045 --> 00:11:40,335
driving adoption across manufacturers
and maintenance providers.

158
00:11:40,835 --> 00:11:45,425
This will make digital twins
easier to implement scale.

159
00:11:45,995 --> 00:11:47,915
And share across the industry.

160
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:50,575
Thank you all for your time and attention.

161
00:11:51,265 --> 00:11:56,205
The future of aviation maintenance
is intelligent, predictive, and

162
00:11:56,205 --> 00:12:01,905
interconnected, and digital twins are
at the heart of the transformation.

163
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:03,005
Thanks again.
