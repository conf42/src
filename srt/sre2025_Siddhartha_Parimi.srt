00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,160
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,470
In this talk, we are going beyond
rockets and rowers to explore the

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,270
engine that quietly drives space
missions which is data engineering.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,610
Space missions today aren't just
sending satellites into orbit.

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,889
They're sending back
massive volumes of data.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,540
We are talking hundreds of gigabytes
per day from just one mission.

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,740
And it's not just about storing it,
it's about collecting it efficiently,

8
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:28,120
processing it in real time, and making it
usable for scientists across the globe.

9
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:29,359
Think of it this way.

10
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:32,819
If rocket science is a body of
the mission, the data engineering

11
00:00:32,819 --> 00:00:36,300
is the brain and nervous system
that makes it all work together.

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,459
Let's talk about the scale of the space.

13
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:43,519
Data today space is vast,
but so is the data it sensor.

14
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:48,169
The ISS alone generates nearly a
terabyte of data every single day.

15
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,249
Imagining downloading every season
of a streaming show every day.

16
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,149
That's the scale we are talking
about to handle this, they have built

17
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,079
powerful distributed systems that
split workloads across missions,

18
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:02,029
almost like a factory assembly line.

19
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,310
And what about the compression?

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,359
It's like vacuum packing your
clothes so you can fit a whole

21
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,799
wardrobe into a carry on.

22
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,299
With compression ratio as high
as tennis to one, we make every

23
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:16,280
bite and every bit of bad count.

24
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,870
Imagine trying to stream Netflix with
only dial up internet connection.

25
00:01:21,245 --> 00:01:24,664
That's what we would face without
these innovations in space data.

26
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:26,824
These numbers tell a story.

27
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:30,035
Data engineering isn't just
supporting space mission.

28
00:01:30,245 --> 00:01:31,234
It's powering them.

29
00:01:32,235 --> 00:01:35,505
So now let's talk about
distributed data systems.

30
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:37,945
Here's where it gets exciting, right?

31
00:01:37,945 --> 00:01:42,115
The distributed architectures,
instead of one gen computer crunching

32
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:44,065
all the data, we use a network of.

33
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,320
Small computers working together,
like a team of chefs in a kitchen,

34
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,090
each preparing a part of the meal.

35
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,470
These systems enhance mission,
success, and scientific outcomes.

36
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,060
Enable efficient data management
across missions are built on a

37
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,960
distributor architecture with
parallel crossing across mini notes.

38
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:09,019
Picture a relay race where data is
passed across runners or processes to

39
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:11,120
input throughput and reduce bottlenecks.

40
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:16,099
These architectures allow space
agencies to scale on demand handling

41
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:20,390
up to one 50 simultaneous data
requests from multiple missions.

42
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,630
Next, we move on to advanced
compression techniques.

43
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,715
So space data travels a long way,
and there's no room for bloated

44
00:02:29,715 --> 00:02:31,320
files on this type network.

45
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,810
So we compress data smartly, not just to
shrink it, but to preserve what matters.

46
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,580
It's like organizing a cluttered
closet, filter out what unnecessary,

47
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,150
keep what's valuable, and arrange
it so you can find it fast.

48
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,650
From the moment data is captured, it
goes through a series of smart steps,

49
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,450
the initial cleanup, priority tagging,
analysis, and long-term storage, all

50
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,770
optimized for speed and scientific value.

51
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,620
Now let's go a bit futuristic
which is quantum computing.

52
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,270
Imagine a normal computer as someone
reading a Jane book one word at a time.

53
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,359
A quantum computer reads
a whole page at once.

54
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:14,370
This leap could change how we plan
missions, navigate deep space and

55
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,990
even encrypt sensitive data, which is
exponential Processing power like quantum

56
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,890
computers can solve space algorithms
much faster than classical systems.

57
00:03:23,429 --> 00:03:27,750
Enhancer encryption using quantum
cryptography to secure spacecraft

58
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,959
comments and data optimization problems.

59
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:34,140
Solving complex challenges in
mission planning and navigation.

60
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,000
Think of a classical computing
as checking every possible

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,650
path through a maze one by one.

62
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,010
Quantum computing explores
all the paths at once.

63
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,570
It's still early days, but the
potential to revolutionize trajectory

64
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:51,140
planning, resource allocation, and
deep space analytics is massive.

65
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,290
Now let's talk about edge
processing for space applications.

66
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:58,770
Have you ever used your phone's
face recognition without internet?

67
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,840
That's what the edge processing is.

68
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,220
Similarly, today's spacecrafts are
smart enough to do some of the data

69
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,360
crunching onboard instead of sending
every bit back to earth the filter

70
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,955
and prioritize it themselves, saving
bandwidth and reacting faster.

71
00:04:13,725 --> 00:04:17,055
With they have on onboard processing,
initial filtering and compression,

72
00:04:17,295 --> 00:04:21,385
intelligent filtering prioritizing
the most important data, autonomous

73
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:25,855
decisions, making mission adjustments
in real time optimized transmission,

74
00:04:25,855 --> 00:04:27,445
sending only what matters.

75
00:04:28,015 --> 00:04:33,205
It's like having a smart assistance on
onboard the spacecraft, one that decides

76
00:04:33,235 --> 00:04:37,225
which photos to keep and which to delete
before uploading them to the cloud.

77
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:41,155
This says energy and bandwidth and
boosts real time decision making.

78
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,360
All at under five watts per node.

79
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,690
Next let's talk about high
performance computing architecture.

80
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,140
Think of space missions as
having a three type data brain.

81
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:55,470
One is in orbit, small but
tough processors that can handle

82
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,420
radiation and code on earth.

83
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,875
Jane Supercomputers for
heavy duty analysis.

84
00:05:00,285 --> 00:05:04,395
And in between cloud platforms,
connecting them for seamless coordination.

85
00:05:04,635 --> 00:05:08,415
It's like having your smartwatch,
laptop, and data centers all

86
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:09,915
working together in a sync.

87
00:05:10,915 --> 00:05:16,105
So now let's talk about real time data
processing capabilities, like with less

88
00:05:16,135 --> 00:05:18,805
than 10 milliseconds latency spacecraft.

89
00:05:18,805 --> 00:05:21,935
No process and act on data
faster than you can blink.

90
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,235
Which has data acquisition
sensors capture raw input.

91
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:29,555
Processing data is evaluated in
milliseconds autonomous action.

92
00:05:29,825 --> 00:05:33,785
The spacecraft makes realtime
decisions and ground notification.

93
00:05:33,785 --> 00:05:36,065
Critical events are related to earth.

94
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:41,045
This is vital for handling solar,
flas, animal, or system fault,

95
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:45,605
especially when waiting 20 minutes
for a signal from me isn't an option.

96
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:49,575
Let's talk about James Webb's
Space Telescope, the golden

97
00:05:49,575 --> 00:05:51,165
child of a modern astronomy.

98
00:05:51,505 --> 00:05:55,735
It sends back about 40 gigs of data
every day, capturing the most detailed

99
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:57,805
images of space we have ever seen.

100
00:05:58,315 --> 00:06:00,445
But raw data alone isn't useful.

101
00:06:00,655 --> 00:06:04,105
The data goes through on onboard
filtering, then to earth, where it's

102
00:06:04,105 --> 00:06:08,335
processed by layered pipelines to
transform those light signals into

103
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,615
breathtaking, imaginary and discoveries.

104
00:06:11,615 --> 00:06:16,805
So space data isn't just for
scientists, it's a major driver of the

105
00:06:16,805 --> 00:06:21,765
global economy from GPS and weather
tracking to agriculture and finance.

106
00:06:21,825 --> 00:06:26,115
Countless industries rely on
space derived data to operate.

107
00:06:26,355 --> 00:06:30,825
In fact, satellite communications
is a largest slice of a four

108
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:32,715
23 billion space economy.

109
00:06:33,135 --> 00:06:37,275
And what fuels that data engineering
quietly running behind the scenes.

110
00:06:38,275 --> 00:06:39,685
So what's next?

111
00:06:39,955 --> 00:06:44,365
Where This is mainly for AI driven
autonomous spacecraft that thinks

112
00:06:44,365 --> 00:06:49,105
and reactive smart as systems, a
delayed tolerant interplanetary and

113
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:53,635
internet to connect future mass spaces,
quantum data centers for solving

114
00:06:53,635 --> 00:06:55,855
problems we can't even imagine today.

115
00:06:56,365 --> 00:07:01,045
And orbital com cloud computing where
spacecraft collaborate by sharing

116
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,725
compute and storage resources.

117
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,840
We are talking about the cloud in literal
space and it's closer than you think.

118
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:15,110
To wrap it all up, as space gets more
ambitious, so much of data systems,

119
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,220
it's no longer just about launching
rockets, it's about managing the

120
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:24,170
data that comes back, making it
actionable, accessible, and powerful.

121
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,880
So thanks for joining me today.

122
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,990
Let's continue to engineer the future
of space one data packet at a time.

123
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:30,950
Thank you.
