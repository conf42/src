1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,309
Good day everyone.

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Victor Abola, and today
I'll be speaking on a very important

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,680
topic in the field of cybersecurity
and digital investigations, how IC

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,000
or improved digital forensic analysis
and evidence collection processes.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,430
In this section, we explore how
digital currency works with active

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,810
intelligence, what this means for
investigators, how modern tools are

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,650
evolving, and the future trends we
should be preparing for in the industry.

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,280
Digital forensics has expanded far
beyond computers with our evidence

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,590
for mobile devices, cloud environment,
vehicles, IOT devices, and more.

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,570
With this expansion comes massive
volume, complexity, and urgency.

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,045
Yet we also have ai, which provides
powerful waste to speed up investigations,

12
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:51,660
surface eating evidence, and reduce
overwhelming forensic backlogs.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,789
It meets ai.

14
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:56,470
Today's evidence landscape is
complex investigative deal with

15
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,119
three to four week backlogs.

16
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:02,559
Because of huge data volumes,
AI helps it to automate routine

17
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,460
task, detect aiding patterns, and
highlight high value evidence.

18
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:12,130
AI augmenting investigative workflows
by automated repetitive tasks.

19
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:16,554
It helps in identifying
patterns humans may miss.

20
00:01:17,185 --> 00:01:21,475
Highlighting priority evidence,
improving consistency and defensibility.

21
00:01:21,975 --> 00:01:25,934
Machine learning detects anomalies
in backlogs where machine

22
00:01:25,934 --> 00:01:30,104
learnings and understanding system
behavior and network traffic.

23
00:01:30,914 --> 00:01:35,145
Machine learning also clusters, active
apps to refill at that campaign.

24
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:36,480
Machining.

25
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,060
Then it also classifies
more aware of families.

26
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,190
Deep learning performs image
and video analysis, facial

27
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,020
recognition and object detection.

28
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,829
It helps to detect medial taming.

29
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:49,869
It helps to analyze more aware behavior.

30
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:55,639
And we are NLP Natural Language
Processing that helps to extract entities

31
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:57,560
from emails, charts, and documents.

32
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:01,280
It helps to perform sentiments
and context analysis.

33
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:03,755
Summarizes long communication trait.

34
00:02:04,255 --> 00:02:07,345
We have an understanding of what
this machine learning and deep

35
00:02:07,345 --> 00:02:11,305
learning and natural language
processing does in our investigation.

36
00:02:11,805 --> 00:02:16,325
So we'll be moving on to key applications
and use cases, automated evidence,

37
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:18,489
trial ai, prioritize relevant evidence.

38
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:22,639
AI helps to like have an
understanding of how to help

39
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,239
arrange our evidences in terms of.

40
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:27,919
Their priority in terms of putting
them together in terms of also

41
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,789
maximizing the full potential of
our investigation and our evidence.

42
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:34,639
We have pattern recognition
where it helps to reveal

43
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:37,219
reoccurring cyber crime patterns.

44
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:38,509
Has this been happening?

45
00:02:38,749 --> 00:02:41,269
What is the duration of period
that has been happening?

46
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:45,659
What are the cases that has happened
that has helped us understand that

47
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:51,029
these cases is is similar media
analysis, categorizes images and ly.

48
00:02:51,529 --> 00:02:52,939
Behavior and disease.

49
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:56,339
It helps to flag insider
traits and abnormal activities.

50
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:58,379
We have network analysis.

51
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,439
It helps to dictate exfoliation
and brute force activity.

52
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:06,839
Data recovery models like CAR dl.
It helps to construct fragmented

53
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:09,809
files with up to 85% of accuracy.

54
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:12,769
Moving on to AI power tools and platforms.

55
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:17,809
We have several platforms and several
AI investigation tools right now.

56
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:22,789
And one of them, one of the
leading is Celebrate Pathfinder

57
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:25,429
and AI driven evidence.

58
00:03:25,429 --> 00:03:26,029
Correlation.

59
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:33,969
We have magnetism, we have Magnet
J, we have Microsoft with GPT,

60
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:36,669
and we are magnet copilot also.

61
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:42,909
The we'll be moving on to the benefits
and industry impact of these tools.

62
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:47,609
AI reduces backlogs, it improve
consistency skills, investigator

63
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:51,329
capacity, and strengthens differe
defensible evidence processes.

64
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:58,709
According to Celebrate 2025
survey, 19% cais positive impact.

65
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:01,949
It is insufficiency,
it's speed up analysis.

66
00:04:02,624 --> 00:04:06,134
82% say it automates repetitive tasks.

67
00:04:06,584 --> 00:04:11,984
61% sees AI as evaluated to as
much as potential of AI being

68
00:04:11,984 --> 00:04:13,454
the risk, AI being the trade.

69
00:04:13,664 --> 00:04:19,174
It owes a lot of important impact
in our industry, in our day-to-day

70
00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:20,764
activities in whatever we do.

71
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:24,599
AI owes an a very, a large
impact of positive impact.

72
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:29,539
Also, we'll be discussing more about real
world implementations, how we've seen.

73
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:31,234
Where we've seen AI work.

74
00:04:32,044 --> 00:04:36,574
Let's take for let's take and a look
into automated data with evidence

75
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:40,984
trials In many law enforcement
agencies, investigators routinely

76
00:04:40,984 --> 00:04:42,934
receive multiple CI devices.

77
00:04:43,354 --> 00:04:46,894
We have phones, we have several
gadgets, laptops, tablets, SB

78
00:04:46,894 --> 00:04:51,814
devices naming, so creating a lot of
backlogs that can stress for weeks.

79
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:55,624
AI driven trial system
automatically scan these devices

80
00:04:55,684 --> 00:04:57,634
the moment they are ingested.

81
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:02,569
Identifying priority items or sustain
deleted messages, suspicious media

82
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:08,089
on usual communication patterns or
recently access files instead of an

83
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:13,594
investigator manually combi through
thousands of artifact, the this AI

84
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:18,949
helps to organize the data by relevance,
drastically reviewing, reducing the

85
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:20,719
review time for the investigators.

86
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:25,569
These tools also highlight
anomalies such as rare file types.

87
00:05:25,914 --> 00:05:30,204
Encrypt containers or apps
frequently used by no offenders.

88
00:05:31,104 --> 00:05:36,174
By automatically producing a structured
preview, investigators can determine

89
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:41,244
which devices require full examination
and which do not, which reduces the

90
00:05:41,244 --> 00:05:45,374
maximum of going through different each
one of the devices and gadget one after

91
00:05:45,374 --> 00:05:49,594
the on this approach automatically
reduce wasted efforts, allowing teams

92
00:05:49,594 --> 00:05:51,679
to focus on the highest value evidence.

93
00:05:52,324 --> 00:05:56,494
In some agencies, this shift has reduced
turnaround time for three to four

94
00:05:56,494 --> 00:06:01,234
weeks, to just a few days improving
case outcomes and speeding of justice.

95
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:06,624
AI also has helped a lot in
investigating C-A-C-S-A-M cases.

96
00:06:07,374 --> 00:06:13,974
Child sexual abuse material is it
helps in the air system with deep

97
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:18,324
learning models can automatically
identify probable abuse content.

98
00:06:18,714 --> 00:06:20,064
Without human exposure.

99
00:06:20,184 --> 00:06:24,204
During the initial review, the
system analyzed image, visual pixel,

100
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:28,884
excel patterns, and contextual
cues to classify unfold media

101
00:06:29,124 --> 00:06:32,454
with accuracy rates as higher 95%.

102
00:06:33,084 --> 00:06:38,304
They also duplicates across global
databases, helping agency connect

103
00:06:38,454 --> 00:06:41,364
vendors to known victims more rapidly.

104
00:06:41,874 --> 00:06:45,129
Because the AI handles the first
layer of screening investigators see.

105
00:06:45,774 --> 00:06:50,814
Only content that has been tried as
relevant, reducing emotional trauma.

106
00:06:50,904 --> 00:06:56,964
The automated, the AI automated
workflow also speeds up reporting

107
00:06:57,144 --> 00:06:59,094
to Child Protection Organization.

108
00:06:59,604 --> 00:07:05,279
Ultimately, AI allows investigators to
focus on the legal and contextual aspect

109
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:09,294
of cases rather than manually reviewing
large volumes of disturbing content.

110
00:07:09,954 --> 00:07:14,139
We, we've seen our AI has improved
a lot of real world cases.

111
00:07:14,804 --> 00:07:18,764
It has helped us have an
understanding of what it takes to

112
00:07:18,854 --> 00:07:21,224
induct AI in our investigation.

113
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:26,154
Let us also take another look at
at another real world case study c

114
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:30,384
dl and similar motives in terms of
deep learning based file recovery.

115
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:35,194
It helps it has shown how traditional
five carbon relies on pattern machine,

116
00:07:35,614 --> 00:07:37,594
which struggles when files are fragmented.

117
00:07:38,094 --> 00:07:42,714
Overwritten or partially corrupted
the deploy approaches social as.

118
00:07:42,814 --> 00:07:47,614
CD uses neural networks trained
on thousands of file fragments

119
00:07:47,824 --> 00:07:51,574
to construc data, even when
traditional methods failed.

120
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:57,074
Looking into a fraud investigation,
suspect or communicate across multiple

121
00:07:57,074 --> 00:08:03,724
channels, SMS, name it, WhatsApp, email,
social media, and lots, like several apps.

122
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:08,049
Which creates a massive text
boarding for analyst NLP.

123
00:08:08,049 --> 00:08:14,289
Tools automatically extract key
entities such as names, locations,

124
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:16,599
transaction details, or repeated keyword.

125
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:20,829
They can also map relationships
between individuals revealing

126
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:23,079
e network of collaborators.

127
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:28,094
In many cases, AI identified
pattern of deception, social

128
00:08:28,114 --> 00:08:29,574
as sudden change in sentiment.

129
00:08:30,354 --> 00:08:34,404
Repeated linguistic structure
used by scammers or put language.

130
00:08:35,034 --> 00:08:39,204
This insight help investigators
quickly establish timelines,

131
00:08:39,804 --> 00:08:41,814
communication, hierarchies, and motives.

132
00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:47,814
The AI also surfaces messages that Devi
is from normal behavior, enabling ANA

133
00:08:47,964 --> 00:08:50,869
analysis to support critical clues faster.

134
00:08:51,369 --> 00:08:56,229
This has shown how important AI has
been, especially in important cases

135
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:02,399
that, helps to show how much we are able
to fish out and attack to understand

136
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:08,209
how we can comb through our evidences
real fast and real quick to make us to

137
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:12,019
make our investigation more fast and
better, we'll be discussing about the

138
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:14,539
challenges and ethical considerations.

139
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:15,789
AI system.

140
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:18,039
We have the bias and fairness in models.

141
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,459
AI system can unintentionally
irritated biases.

142
00:09:22,374 --> 00:09:25,674
From the dataset they are trained
on, which may lead to on unfair

143
00:09:25,674 --> 00:09:27,324
outcomes during investigation.

144
00:09:27,774 --> 00:09:32,034
Let's take for example, even AI model
has been trained primarily on data

145
00:09:32,784 --> 00:09:34,464
from a specific demographic group.

146
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:39,594
It may falsely classify
or over prioritized data

147
00:09:39,594 --> 00:09:41,154
belonging to those population.

148
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:46,014
This can lead to unequal treatment and
investigation or misinterpretation of

149
00:09:46,014 --> 00:09:49,734
digital evidence, forensic outcome, most.

150
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:54,579
Be consistent across all individuals
regardless of age, ethnicity,

151
00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:56,139
gender, or socioeconomic background.

152
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,679
We have the privacy and legal constraints.

153
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:04,259
We it's resists a lot of complexity
when people are being where like when

154
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:09,299
we don't take need and real clear of
what it takes to have a privacy and

155
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:11,789
legacy constraint in our AI system.

156
00:10:12,674 --> 00:10:16,484
AI analysis often involve processing
massive amounts of personal

157
00:10:16,484 --> 00:10:22,094
information, auto messages, location,
history, and a lot of metadatas.

158
00:10:22,634 --> 00:10:25,484
It raises a lot of complex privacy issues.

159
00:10:25,934 --> 00:10:31,514
Investigators must follow sheets, legal
frameworks, including warrants, data

160
00:10:31,514 --> 00:10:35,414
minimization laws, and restriction
on access cloud across data.

161
00:10:36,104 --> 00:10:39,764
Cross-border datas
mismanaging data privacy.

162
00:10:39,854 --> 00:10:45,404
Can compromise an entire investigation
or expose agency to legal liabilities

163
00:10:45,614 --> 00:10:48,254
and definitely no agency or no.

164
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:52,324
Standard wants to go through social
and also the explainability and

165
00:10:52,324 --> 00:10:54,029
code admissibility is the third one.

166
00:10:54,909 --> 00:11:00,139
Many AI models, especially deep
planning systems, operate as black

167
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:04,529
boxes, making it difficult to clearly
describe their internal workflows.

168
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:10,859
Their processes, and most of the time
it's often invalidate a lot of things.

169
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:16,349
Courts often require transparent,
reproducible, and auditable

170
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:20,189
workflows to validate their
evidence was processed correctly.

171
00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:25,889
If investigators cannot explain as
an AI output, a defense autonomy,

172
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:27,749
or really challenge its credibility.

173
00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:31,339
Fourth on this list, we have
reliability and hallucination.

174
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:36,169
Although AI is very powerful, yeah,
understandably, it is not perfect and

175
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:41,329
can occasionally miss some upgrade data
or generate incorrect conclusions known

176
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:46,879
as hallucination In data forensics,
relying on hallucinated output can

177
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,469
lead to false leads, which identified
suspect or misclassified evidence.

178
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:58,309
Investigators must always validate
AI findings against raw, verifiable

179
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,119
data before, during conclusions.

180
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:04,239
Reliability testing is
essential, especially when

181
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:07,209
models are updated or retrain.

182
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:13,199
Systems should have safeguards to alert
users when confidence scores are low,

183
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:16,889
or evidence requires human review and.

184
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:22,309
Fifth on this list, which is one
of the most important governance,

185
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:23,719
oversight and accountability.

186
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:29,299
Successful AI deployment requires clear
governance frameworks that define how

187
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:32,059
tools are used, monitored, and audited.

188
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:36,709
Agencies must establish policy
detailing who is authorized to run

189
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:41,739
AI processes, how output should be
interpreted, and what documentation

190
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:43,359
did you require for every case.

191
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:45,249
Regular audit helps.

192
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:49,779
It helps to ensure that AI to
remain compliant with evolving

193
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:51,004
laws and ethical standards.

194
00:12:51,364 --> 00:12:57,814
Oversight teams must also evaluate
model performance, DIC drift, and

195
00:12:57,814 --> 00:13:03,764
ensure tools are not misused or
applied outside their intended scope.

196
00:13:04,264 --> 00:13:10,624
And woman number six, woman
exported remains irreplaceable.

197
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:16,009
Even with advanced AI capabilities,
Oman investigators bring contextual,

198
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:21,829
understanding, intuition, and critical
reasoning that machines cannot replicate.

199
00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:27,349
AI may alight patterns or
anomalies, but women must interpret

200
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:30,469
their significance within the
broader investigative narrative.

201
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:38,299
Complex cases involving emotional, social,
or behavioral element require non-judgment

202
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:40,579
that no model can actually fully capture.

203
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,699
This is like a great understanding
of the challenges and the ethical

204
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:47,609
consideration that we might have using ai.

205
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:53,039
And actually it helps us understand of
the kind of steps and processes of things

206
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:58,499
we should follow that would improve and
help our efficiency also in investigation.

207
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:02,504
Looking into the future trends,
what to expect, things we

208
00:14:02,504 --> 00:14:03,914
should focus on going forward.

209
00:14:04,514 --> 00:14:09,394
We have the LLM forensic copilot
that has been integrated across

210
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:12,494
a lot of DFIR work workflows.

211
00:14:12,994 --> 00:14:16,924
It represents one of the most significant
advancement in digital investigation.

212
00:14:17,764 --> 00:14:22,564
This AI assistant can summarize
case artifacts, interpret logs,

213
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:28,204
explain technical findings, and even
generate preliminary forensic reports.

214
00:14:28,804 --> 00:14:31,234
Unlike traditional tools.

215
00:14:31,624 --> 00:14:36,454
They provide contextual reasoning,
helping investigators quickly

216
00:14:36,954 --> 00:14:38,664
understand conversions of events.

217
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:44,664
Co-pilot are also cross reference
multiple types of evidence messages,

218
00:14:44,664 --> 00:14:48,684
metadata, images and timeline to
highlight patterns, human MI value.

219
00:14:49,184 --> 00:14:51,899
And number two, under list,
we have the automated cloud

220
00:14:52,229 --> 00:14:54,889
forensics cloud platform store.

221
00:14:55,324 --> 00:14:56,444
Enormous amount of evidence.

222
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,119
But they are distributed and encrypted.

223
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:01,129
Nature makes investigation difficult.

224
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:07,429
Future forensic tools will integrate
automated cloud evidence capture,

225
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:12,439
allowing AI to collect logs, reconstruct
timelines, detected suspicious

226
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:18,169
activity across AWS Azure, Google
Cloud, and hybrid to architectures.

227
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:23,169
These systems will track
authentication events.

228
00:15:23,229 --> 00:15:23,864
API calls.

229
00:15:24,504 --> 00:15:28,614
By movement and access attempt
to create a full picture of

230
00:15:28,614 --> 00:15:30,144
what happened during the breach.

231
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:36,084
And number three, on the list, we have
the IOT and vehicle forensic inspection.

232
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:41,859
The growth, the growth of IO OT has
connected vehicles, has created new

233
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:46,044
forensic data sources from smart home
sensors to automotive telematics.

234
00:15:46,749 --> 00:15:47,349
Visual tools.

235
00:15:47,349 --> 00:15:52,779
We incorporate AI models capable of
interpreting diverse iot metadata, social

236
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:57,459
device activity log, location based
triggers and environmental interactions.

237
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:02,999
This trend marks a significant expansion
of what is considered digital evidence.

238
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:07,439
We have advanced counter
anti forensic capabilities.

239
00:16:07,939 --> 00:16:11,479
Criminals are increasingly using
anti forensic techniques like data

240
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:16,039
wiping, stick iconography, timestamp
manipulation, or encrypted containers

241
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:20,899
to I. Their tracks Visual AI system
will be designed to dictate these

242
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:23,149
techniques with far greater accuracy.

243
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:29,329
Deep lining models will identify so
to inconsistency in metadata residue

244
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:35,059
patterns left after wiping or pixel
level up anomaly that suggest tampering.

245
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:39,439
AI will become a critical defense
defense against increasingly

246
00:16:39,739 --> 00:16:41,569
sophisticated digital cover.

247
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:43,819
We should have an understanding of that.

248
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:47,769
And the fifth on this
list is standardized.

249
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:50,499
Automating pipelines for investigation.

250
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:55,689
As AI becomes more embedded in the digital
forensics organization will move forward,

251
00:16:55,869 --> 00:17:00,839
standardize repeated workflows that
reduce error and increase consistency.

252
00:17:01,244 --> 00:17:02,174
Automation pipelines.

253
00:17:02,174 --> 00:17:05,924
We are the tasks such as
evidence in the ingestion, ashin,

254
00:17:06,404 --> 00:17:10,484
triad, artifact, destruction,
correlation, and initial reporting.

255
00:17:10,984 --> 00:17:15,154
In the long term, automated forensic
pipelines will become the industry

256
00:17:15,154 --> 00:17:17,794
north rather than an advanced feature.

257
00:17:18,294 --> 00:17:18,924
We should know that.

258
00:17:19,424 --> 00:17:24,744
And most importantly, number six, AI
power training and upskilling at scale.

259
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:29,804
The shortage of forensic investigators
is like a global challenge, like

260
00:17:29,804 --> 00:17:32,714
a global thing, especially as
cyber camp concerns to grow.

261
00:17:33,474 --> 00:17:39,894
These systems can generate customized
exercises based on a learning skills

262
00:17:39,924 --> 00:17:42,024
level and provide immediate feedback.

263
00:17:42,524 --> 00:17:44,684
LLM based tutor thought
will explain concept.

264
00:17:45,304 --> 00:17:49,774
Guide trainings through complex
findings and answer technical

265
00:17:49,774 --> 00:17:50,734
questions in real time.

266
00:17:51,034 --> 00:17:55,804
Most importantly, we just have to keep
improving our language, learn more,

267
00:17:56,434 --> 00:18:00,994
and as a result, workforce readiness
improves and the overall quality

268
00:18:00,994 --> 00:18:02,884
of digital investigation increases.

269
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:08,009
Most importantly, one thing I want us to
focus on is the central insights from the.

270
00:18:08,729 --> 00:18:13,229
Integration of AI into digital is
that the most effective investigative

271
00:18:13,229 --> 00:18:18,239
outcomes emerge from combining machine
efficiency with Oman expertise.

272
00:18:18,739 --> 00:18:22,759
In conclusion, the future of digital
forensics will be defined by a

273
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:27,944
balanced partnership between advanced
automation and skilled Oman analysis.

274
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:33,759
AI will become, it would always
continue to enhance capacity.

275
00:18:34,134 --> 00:18:36,534
Reduce backlogs and uncover ING patterns.

276
00:18:37,314 --> 00:18:41,364
While investigators maintain
responsibility for interpretation,

277
00:18:41,814 --> 00:18:46,404
validation, and adherence to legal,
an ethical standards as forensic

278
00:18:46,404 --> 00:18:50,334
technology, enforce organization
that successfully integrate both

279
00:18:50,485 --> 00:18:54,774
human and artificial intelligence
will achieve the strongest and most

280
00:18:54,774 --> 00:18:56,664
trustworthy investigative outcomes.

281
00:18:57,164 --> 00:19:00,309
Thank you very much for listening
and I would be open to any questions.

282
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:01,739
Thank you very much.
