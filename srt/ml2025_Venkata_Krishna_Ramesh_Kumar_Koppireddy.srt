152
00:11:09,224 --> 00:11:12,795
Assess your current identity
systems and consider AI integration.

153
00:11:13,245 --> 00:11:18,255
I would like to give an example of
overall system where we can implement ai.

154
00:11:18,885 --> 00:11:22,724
It could be a network security
or an application security.

155
00:11:23,324 --> 00:11:25,155
Our data privacy, our

156
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,380
data security.

157
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,439
We can implement ai.

158
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:37,770
Let's take one, one example at each
instance, for example, network security.

159
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:44,849
If we implement AI in network security,
we can save a lot of our team's time

160
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:50,069
and effort in, in figuring out what
exactly the fraudulent activity are.

161
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:54,180
We can reduce the numerous false
positives and increase, increase

162
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,479
our team performance and try to.

163
00:11:57,574 --> 00:12:01,654
Increase our effectiveness, the way
in which the team is performing.

164
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:05,284
The tasks are increase our productivity.

165
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:11,614
By implementing ai, like for example,
if we are collecting all the logs and

166
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:16,344
we are storing them in a system that we
are getting from sim, if we integrate

167
00:12:16,374 --> 00:12:21,694
ai, it would be much easier for AI to
go and review the data and tag it along

168
00:12:21,694 --> 00:12:26,394
with the most recent activity and figure
out whether any unwanted activity or

169
00:12:26,394 --> 00:12:28,254
unauthorized activities are happening.

170
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:32,014
Which which a normal
network resource can do.

171
00:12:32,014 --> 00:12:33,364
But that takes a lot of time.

172
00:12:33,364 --> 00:12:38,644
But whereas AI can do it much faster
with less resources when coming to the

173
00:12:38,644 --> 00:12:44,814
development, we can use AI to write more
code in less time and help to validate

174
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,405
our, test our systems proactively.

175
00:12:48,084 --> 00:12:49,080
And for any.

176
00:12:49,954 --> 00:12:56,105
Leaks in the code or any memory management
or any password leaks that are happening

177
00:12:56,105 --> 00:13:04,415
through code, we can use AI to, to make
our code more secure and coming to the

178
00:13:04,444 --> 00:13:10,895
data security we can implement AI to, to
figure out what exactly would be the best.

179
00:13:11,285 --> 00:13:18,585
Applicable solution for our environment
and we can try to test multiple solutions

180
00:13:18,585 --> 00:13:22,834
that AI provides and choose the best one
that suits our budget and the resource

181
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:25,115
that we have to manage that solution.

182
00:13:27,185 --> 00:13:27,694
That's all.

183
00:13:27,785 --> 00:13:28,324
Thank you.

184
00:13:28,355 --> 00:13:35,464
I will, I would like to thank everyone who
is present here to watch my presentation.

185
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:35,915
Thank you.

186
00:13:35,944 --> 00:13:36,724
Have a good day.
