1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:00,830
Hey.

2
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:01,549
Hi people.

3
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,050
Good morning everyone, and
thank you for joining me today.

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,084
My name is Linga Ella, and I
am from Fairfield University.

5
00:00:09,584 --> 00:00:15,444
It's pleasure to be here at conference
42 JavaScript 2025 sharing insights

6
00:00:15,444 --> 00:00:19,684
on one of the most transformative
evolutions in in frontend architecture

7
00:00:20,344 --> 00:00:24,944
and how it's fast tracking a
integration in modern web applications.

8
00:00:25,444 --> 00:00:31,084
Over the past few years JavaScript
has become the backbone of

9
00:00:31,205 --> 00:00:33,485
nearly every digital experience.

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,690
From the simplest landing page
to complex AI powered platforms.

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:47,550
But as our application has grown so have
the challenges, particularly when it comes

12
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:53,050
to embedding artificial intelligence in,
into existing and large scale systems.

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,710
Today, I will walk you through how
the micro front runs can break those

14
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:06,600
barriers, helping teams innovate
faster, deploy smarter, and deliver AI

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,480
features independently without being
slowed down by monolithic architecture.

16
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,695
Let's go into the first slide.

17
00:01:15,195 --> 00:01:21,445
In today's digital landscape the users
expect applications that are intelligent,

18
00:01:22,195 --> 00:01:25,075
responsive, and constantly evolving.

19
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:31,435
Whether it's personalization,
predictive analytics are the

20
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,475
nature language chatbots.

21
00:01:33,975 --> 00:01:41,575
AI has become the central to modern user
experiences, but here is the challenge.

22
00:01:41,655 --> 00:01:46,365
Most frontend architectures
weren't designed for this kind

23
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:50,995
of rapid evolution coming to the
traditional monolithic front ends.

24
00:01:51,275 --> 00:01:53,170
It forces every team to work.

25
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:56,615
Within the same reliable cycle.

26
00:01:57,115 --> 00:02:03,505
Adding a new AI powered feature often
means touching code basis of a shared

27
00:02:03,505 --> 00:02:09,775
code basis, or retesting the entire
application or regression testing and

28
00:02:09,805 --> 00:02:12,715
waiting for the full scale deployments.

29
00:02:13,075 --> 00:02:19,105
The result, it will slower our
release cycles or break dependencies.

30
00:02:19,495 --> 00:02:22,345
And miss opportunities for innovation.

31
00:02:22,845 --> 00:02:28,654
And as the organizations try
to scale AI capabilities, these

32
00:02:28,654 --> 00:02:31,554
bottlenecks become even more painful.

33
00:02:32,054 --> 00:02:35,354
That's what the micro frontends come in.

34
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:37,234
Let's go to the next slide.

35
00:02:37,734 --> 00:02:40,944
So here what are the
micro front ends, right?

36
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:48,164
The micro front ends take inspiration from
microservice revolution on the backend.

37
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:53,989
Instead of building one massive JavaScript
application, we decompose it into

38
00:02:53,989 --> 00:03:01,369
smaller, independently deployable units,
each owned by specific team or domain.

39
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:07,329
Think of it as a federation or
self-contained front ends, right?

40
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:14,140
Each with its own lifecycle technology
choices and release schedules.

41
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,490
Coming to the benefits of
these micro front ends.

42
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,740
They're immediate, right?

43
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,735
So the teams can deploy independently
without waiting for this.

44
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,835
Centralized release.

45
00:03:27,735 --> 00:03:33,135
And developers gain autonomy
focusing deeply on the feature

46
00:03:33,465 --> 00:03:35,715
specific feature areas.

47
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:38,815
And they have technology freedom.

48
00:03:39,465 --> 00:03:43,565
Let's say if you have to choose between
different frontend frameworks, right?

49
00:03:43,565 --> 00:03:47,995
Such as such as react View,
angular, or whether it is vanilla,

50
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,000
plain vanilla, JavaScript.

51
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:55,540
You have that freedom Micro frontends
essentially bring modularity and

52
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,460
agility to the frontend world.

53
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,350
And that opens new doors
for the AI integration.

54
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,410
Let's go to next slide.

55
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,155
The AI integration advantages right?

56
00:04:08,075 --> 00:04:10,085
So what are the advantages?

57
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:11,705
Let's connect the dots here.

58
00:04:12,665 --> 00:04:18,485
When teams are free to develop
and deploy independently, they can

59
00:04:18,715 --> 00:04:23,185
introduce AI capabilities without
touching the core application code.

60
00:04:24,155 --> 00:04:28,885
Let's say for example, a chart
bot it, a chart bot can be,

61
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:33,925
can deploy conversational AI as
a standalone micro front end.

62
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:36,375
And a recommendation engine.

63
00:04:36,615 --> 00:04:40,935
A team can integrate personal
personalization independently.

64
00:04:41,435 --> 00:04:46,475
A data analytics team can build
predictive dashboards without

65
00:04:46,505 --> 00:04:48,934
disrupting the other workflows.

66
00:04:49,434 --> 00:04:56,554
So each AI feature can evolve at a, at
its own pace, using their own stack.

67
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:04,489
And even run experiments in isolation
without affecting the core code base.

68
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:12,200
This autonomy allows organizations to
deliver ai mul multiple three times

69
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:19,789
faster, test more variations, and adapt
quickly to what user actually responds to.

70
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:21,999
That's the beauty of this model.

71
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:26,500
Faster innovation without
coordination bottlenecks.

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,210
And

73
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,549
yeah, this is the real world
impact which I covered earlier.

74
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:36,515
It's three times faster and the
results speaks for themselves, right?

75
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:41,374
Like the companies adopting micro
frontend architecture for AI report.

76
00:05:42,304 --> 00:05:48,034
Up to three times faster, the feature
delivery cycles, and they have seen

77
00:05:48,034 --> 00:05:54,754
a 45% increase in the user engagement
driven by rapid a experimentation.

78
00:05:55,504 --> 00:06:01,455
And their AB testing speeds have grown by
nearly 10 times, allowing them to compare

79
00:06:01,455 --> 00:06:04,125
multiple AI variations simultaneously.

80
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:10,585
When the team no longer waits on each
other experimentation, flourishes, right?

81
00:06:10,944 --> 00:06:13,495
And that's where the AI thrives

82
00:06:13,995 --> 00:06:14,474
here.

83
00:06:14,604 --> 00:06:17,115
Module Federation with Webpac five.

84
00:06:17,505 --> 00:06:19,005
This is how we are going to implement.

85
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:22,325
This is come coming to
this technical foundation.

86
00:06:22,814 --> 00:06:26,534
Now let's explore how
this works technically.

87
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:32,054
The foundation of most modern
front-end frameworks setups is module

88
00:06:32,144 --> 00:06:35,984
Federation introduced with Webpac five.

89
00:06:36,484 --> 00:06:39,864
So Module Federation enables
different applications.

90
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:45,519
Even built with the different
frameworks to share code at runtime.

91
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:50,400
You can expose a component
from one project and consume it

92
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,599
dynamically from another project
without rebuilding or redeploying.

93
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:57,200
Here is how the basic flow works, right?

94
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:04,020
You can configure the Model Federation
plugin and define which module to expose.

95
00:07:04,995 --> 00:07:07,455
And you can expose your AI components.

96
00:07:07,455 --> 00:07:13,465
Say you say recommended recommendation
wi our chart bot consume that module

97
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:15,234
remotely in another front end.

98
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:19,634
And and also we can share
common dependencies like reactor

99
00:07:19,724 --> 00:07:22,269
view or, optimize bundle size.

100
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:27,604
This setup allows truly distributed
development while maintaining

101
00:07:27,604 --> 00:07:29,674
seamless user experience.

102
00:07:30,174 --> 00:07:34,445
This is the edge side
composition techniques coming

103
00:07:34,445 --> 00:07:35,854
to this these techniques.

104
00:07:35,945 --> 00:07:39,405
The next major enable is said composition.

105
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,909
It's a performance focused
approach that assembles micro

106
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:47,510
frontend at CDN Edge, right?

107
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:53,560
Traditionally the composition
happens on a client which can

108
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,840
increase initial load time.

109
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:02,800
But the ED side composition the CDN
stitches together only the necessary.

110
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:06,055
Microfund for each route.

111
00:08:06,955 --> 00:08:10,725
Whether it's serving a lighter,
faster bundles bundles to

112
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:13,865
the user this improves time.

113
00:08:13,915 --> 00:08:19,965
Time to interactive enables
independent caching and delivers

114
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:25,355
an instantly responsive experience
across the distributed networks.

115
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:31,305
In simpler terms, the user gets
what they need from the nearest edge

116
00:08:31,305 --> 00:08:33,555
node, the movement, they need it.

117
00:08:34,245 --> 00:08:38,865
This will reduce the, bundle size
and make the applications faster.

118
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,095
This is how we do it.

119
00:08:40,595 --> 00:08:45,460
And next step is web
assembly integration for ai.

120
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:52,300
So coming to this technique one of the
most exciting advances in is how the web

121
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:59,850
assembly or WASM brings machine learning
directly to the browser by compiling

122
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:06,420
AI models from frameworks like transfer
flow or pie chart into web assembly.

123
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:14,450
We can execute interfaces on the
client side, achieving near native

124
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:18,920
performance as what we do, what
we usually do on the backend side.

125
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:27,760
This means complex task like predictions,
image classification, or the sentiment

126
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,060
analysis can run instantly without.

127
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,030
Round trips to the server.

128
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:38,850
And it's not just faster, but
it's also privacy friendly

129
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,340
and cost efficient, right?

130
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,750
Since the sensitive data never leaves
the user device, imagine delivering a

131
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:53,570
fully functional recommendation engine
directly through a micro front end.

132
00:09:54,305 --> 00:09:55,835
Powered by web assembly

133
00:09:56,335 --> 00:09:59,665
now, the API integration strategies.

134
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:07,825
So while the web assembly handles local
local inference, most AI systems still

135
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:10,555
rely on a PA for deeper intelligence.

136
00:10:11,055 --> 00:10:18,495
And micro frontend can integrate
these APIs independently allowing

137
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,865
fine grain control and versioning.

138
00:10:21,365 --> 00:10:24,545
We we typically see two major patterns.

139
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:27,995
One is the rest, API integration.

140
00:10:28,235 --> 00:10:31,055
Another one is GraphQL Federation.

141
00:10:31,555 --> 00:10:34,055
Coming to this a rest API integration.

142
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:41,079
We have standard HT DP endpoint that each
micro function manages independently.

143
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:48,599
Teams can evolve their AI services,
update models or handle retrieve

144
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,540
without affecting the other services.

145
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,259
And coming to this GraphQL Federation
where multiple micro front ends.

146
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:02,209
Contribute subgraphs for
to form a unified schema.

147
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:08,589
This enables type safe queries that
span multiple AI services without

148
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:11,650
precision reducing network overhead.

149
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:17,889
Together these patterns make AI
communication modular and scalable.

150
00:11:18,805 --> 00:11:21,175
It just like the architecture itself.

151
00:11:21,675 --> 00:11:25,355
And next step is state
management across front ends.

152
00:11:25,805 --> 00:11:30,125
This is one of the most important
pieces in the front end architecture.

153
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:35,445
So here one of the biggest
concern is distributed front ends

154
00:11:35,535 --> 00:11:38,145
in state is state managements.

155
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:43,104
And, how do we maintain consistency
when multiple micro frontends

156
00:11:43,104 --> 00:11:46,044
share the same or user context?

157
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:49,824
So the solution lies in layered approach.

158
00:11:50,474 --> 00:11:55,935
Let's say we can keep local state within
each micro frontend whenever possible.

159
00:11:56,905 --> 00:12:01,690
Or for shared state, we can use custom
events or the lightweight shared store.

160
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:06,320
Are, maintain consistent UI
updates through optimistic

161
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,380
rendering patterns, right?

162
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:15,640
And this approach allows each component
to remain isolated, yet responsible to

163
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:21,875
global events, maintaining a seamless
user experience, even as the AI features

164
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,410
are dynamically loaded or replaced.

165
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,970
Coming to the performance optimization
techniques eventually the build size

166
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:34,230
we are trying to reduce the build
size by decoupling the monolithic

167
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,380
application into micro front ends.

168
00:12:37,325 --> 00:12:42,145
And then also we can we don't have to
load everything at once in the front

169
00:12:42,145 --> 00:12:44,665
end that makes the browser slower.

170
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:50,635
So we have four techniques consist
consistently deliver results.

171
00:12:51,055 --> 00:12:57,605
So the first one is the lazy loading A
components dynamically import features on

172
00:12:57,605 --> 00:13:00,815
demand to mini minimize the initial load.

173
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:03,485
And efficient resource sharing.

174
00:13:03,935 --> 00:13:10,765
So we, if you have common components or
dependencies, we can reuse them to prevent

175
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:14,205
the code duplication and advanced caching.

176
00:13:14,415 --> 00:13:19,695
So use service workers to
cache the API responses are

177
00:13:19,695 --> 00:13:23,220
predictions intelligently, right?

178
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,485
The next one is serverless deployments.

179
00:13:26,845 --> 00:13:31,895
Deploy via the edge networks
and JavaScript run times

180
00:13:31,955 --> 00:13:34,085
for global reach, right?

181
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:40,255
And with all these techniques
together, these strategies keep the

182
00:13:40,255 --> 00:13:45,865
distributed front ends performing
like the single cohesive application.

183
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:50,215
It'll be smooth, fast, and reliable.

184
00:13:50,715 --> 00:13:52,935
This is the implementation roadmap.

185
00:13:53,435 --> 00:13:58,205
So now that's, we have
covered the what and the how.

186
00:13:58,715 --> 00:14:02,015
Let's look into the
implementation journey, right?

187
00:14:02,465 --> 00:14:04,955
So assess your current architecture.

188
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:09,605
So identify monolithic pain
points, especially where the

189
00:14:09,605 --> 00:14:11,165
AI integration is blocked.

190
00:14:11,665 --> 00:14:18,105
Define clear boundaries like organize
around business domains ensuring

191
00:14:18,195 --> 00:14:24,675
each team owns a meaningful slice of
functionality, let's say features, right?

192
00:14:25,175 --> 00:14:30,585
Implement module federation set
up shade, dependency management,

193
00:14:30,825 --> 00:14:33,145
and deployment pipelines.

194
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:36,105
Integrate your first AI feature.

195
00:14:36,685 --> 00:14:45,055
The key here is start small, maybe a chart
bot or a analytics widget, and use it as

196
00:14:45,055 --> 00:14:48,345
a proof of concept scale and optimize.

197
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:54,875
Gradually once once you get a taste of
it, then you can gradually expand, measure

198
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,575
performance, and it rate continuously.

199
00:14:58,075 --> 00:15:03,745
Here the key is to start small,
learn fast, and scale confidently.

200
00:15:04,245 --> 00:15:06,735
These are the key takeaways.

201
00:15:07,235 --> 00:15:12,895
To summarize micro front ends
fundamentally change how we approach

202
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:14,905
AI integration in modern web apps.

203
00:15:15,405 --> 00:15:22,215
They remove independent bottlenecks,
allowing the teams to deliver a

204
00:15:22,215 --> 00:15:26,025
capabilities rapidly and independently.

205
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:33,235
They empower specialized teams to
experiment, iterate, and innovate

206
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:36,100
without waiting on centralized approvals.

207
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,840
And with technologies like module
Federation and edge side composition

208
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:48,140
and web assembly, they deliver
exceptional performances and flexibility.

209
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:55,510
Whether you, your tech stack is react,
view, angular, or plain JavaScript, these

210
00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:00,720
strategies can transform your architecture
and accelerate your AI roadmap.

211
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:06,020
I am experimenting with these technologies
to create an e-commerce application,

212
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:13,170
which will cover the user application and
also the admin application for the store.

213
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:18,370
And also we have, we are going
to develop a driver app, which

214
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:23,220
will evolve, which will encourage
the e-commerce applications.

215
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,045
It is work in progress, but eventually we
will get there and yeah, we'll, it'll be

216
00:16:29,885 --> 00:16:32,325
production ready in few months from now.

217
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,565
And coming to this closing points.

218
00:16:35,065 --> 00:16:39,870
As a, as developers, our mission
is to build systems that can

219
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,150
evolve as fast as our ideas.

220
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:47,960
Micro sentence give us that
agility, allowing every team to

221
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:54,050
contribute intelligence, creative,
and innovation without friction.

222
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,454
As you head back to your
projects, think modularly,

223
00:16:57,954 --> 00:16:59,679
think independently, deployable.

224
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:05,039
And think of how each microfund
can become a building block of

225
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,560
our next AI driven experience.

226
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,560
Thank you all for your time, your
attention and your curiosity today.

227
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:18,629
I am ling from Fairfield University and
it's been pleasure sharing this with

228
00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:21,949
you at conference 42 JavaScript 2025.

229
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:25,674
Hopefully we'll catch you
some other time in the future.

230
00:17:26,174 --> 00:17:27,374
Have a good rest of your day.

231
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:27,914
Thank you.
