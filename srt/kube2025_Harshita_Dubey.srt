00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,620
Welcome everyone, and thanks
for joining my session on

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,330
Transforming Knowledge Systems.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:11,570
I'm Haida Dube from Apex FinTech
Solutions x Dell having a patent as well.

4
00:00:11,629 --> 00:00:14,719
And today we'll explore how embedding
analytics within cloud native

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,099
architectures, specifically Kubernetes
can revolutionize knowledge management.

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,730
This session is inspired by real
enterprise challenges where static

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,180
repository is no longer made
dynamic data driven business needs.

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,949
Let's start with the current state,
or 50% of the enterprise knowledge

9
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:32,860
management systems are failing
to meet their performance goals.

10
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:36,249
It's about 15,000 plus employees
across the global offices.

11
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,660
Many organizations are.

12
00:00:38,374 --> 00:00:40,264
Are struggling with
knowledge accessibility.

13
00:00:40,654 --> 00:00:41,764
What's the key issue here?

14
00:00:42,214 --> 00:00:45,065
It is traditional systems were
never designed for today's

15
00:00:45,065 --> 00:00:47,135
distributed cloud first environments.

16
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:50,794
They are slow, siloed, and
difficult to scale, hindering

17
00:00:50,794 --> 00:00:52,474
productivity and innovation.

18
00:00:52,974 --> 00:00:55,644
So what are the root causes
of knowledge system failures?

19
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,904
There are three.

20
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:57,629
That.

21
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:58,650
Those are the main ones.

22
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,700
The siloed design where teams and
departments operate in isolation, creating

23
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,320
the fragmented knowledge repositories,
outdated architecture that is monolith

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,610
systems that cannot adapt quickly to
changing business or user demands and

25
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,380
poor adoption, where users abandon tools
that fail to deliver relevant results

26
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,940
or provide an intuitive interface.

27
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,510
These issues make it clear that
traditional knowledge management needs

28
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,100
a complete architectural rethink.

29
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,440
Now this slide contrast two
paradigms, the static repository

30
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,300
versus the containerized ecosystem.

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,280
Traditional tools like SharePoint served
as a static document, source and contrast.

32
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,610
Kubernetes enables a
dynamic adaptive ecosystem.

33
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,630
A Kubernetes native approach
supports automation, embedded

34
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,550
analytics and continuous learning.

35
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,735
Helping systems evolve with user needs.

36
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,179
So what is the goal here?

37
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,780
The goal is to move from
infl inflexible systems to

38
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,460
intelligent, responsive platforms.

39
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:58,775
Here's an overview of the architecture
where SharePoint Online serves as the

40
00:01:58,775 --> 00:02:03,394
content source, containerized services,
managed analytics, search and automation.

41
00:02:03,664 --> 00:02:07,864
While Kubernetes orchestration ensures the
scalability, resilience, and continuous

42
00:02:07,864 --> 00:02:12,605
deployment, this layered approach, as
we call it, decoupled services, allowing

43
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:17,195
independent scaling and modernization
without disrupting the base content layer.

44
00:02:17,695 --> 00:02:19,315
There are three main components to it.

45
00:02:19,554 --> 00:02:24,325
User behavior analytics, which will track
engagement, clickthroughs and navigation

46
00:02:24,325 --> 00:02:28,584
patterns, search pattern mining that
identifies how users query and where

47
00:02:28,584 --> 00:02:33,174
searches fail, and real time feedback
loops that adapt search results and

48
00:02:33,174 --> 00:02:35,124
recommendations based on user actions.

49
00:02:35,874 --> 00:02:39,385
Now this roadmap outlines how to
evolve from setup to intelligent

50
00:02:39,385 --> 00:02:41,964
optimization during the foundation phase.

51
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,940
Teams deploy Kubernetes
clusters, design microservices,

52
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,620
and integrate SharePoint APIs.

53
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,340
During the analytics phase,
you roll out analytics tracking

54
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,900
and early AI recommendations.

55
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:58,720
During the intelligence phase, introduce
NLP and predictive analytics and the

56
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,710
most important phase, and last but
not the least, is optimization phase.

57
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,700
That is when you automate governance
and scale enterprise wide.

58
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,670
After full implementation, which we
saw were impressive, there were 33%

59
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:16,290
faster information, retrieval rate,
35% fewer support tickets, and 22%

60
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,180
boost in self-service resolution rates.

61
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,560
These outcomes mean users find answers
faster, support load decreases,

62
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,750
and also knowledge flows freely.

63
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,410
The key takeaways are embedded
analytics makes systems smarter

64
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,115
and self-improving over time.

65
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:33,255
The impact extended to
user experience as well.

66
00:03:33,524 --> 00:03:37,755
The metrics like user satisfaction
was increased by 37.5%.

67
00:03:38,054 --> 00:03:41,204
The onboarding time dropped by almost 25%.

68
00:03:41,565 --> 00:03:44,924
Thing that was taking 14
weeks is now taking 11 weeks.

69
00:03:44,984 --> 00:03:47,415
And content relevance
improved significantly.

70
00:03:47,864 --> 00:03:51,734
These gains comes from integrating
feedback loops and relevance

71
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:54,975
tracking proof that a better system
directly enhances productivity

72
00:03:55,005 --> 00:03:56,029
and employee engagement.

73
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:58,329
Smart features powered by Kubernetes.

74
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:01,899
Kubernetes powers
intelligence layer with NLS.

75
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:05,320
That is natural language search
by understanding intent beyond the

76
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,849
keywords, context aware filtering
where de delivering the results based

77
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:14,440
on user rules or project context and
predictive analytics By anticipating

78
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,700
user needs before even the search,
these capabilities turn a passive

79
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,604
repository into an active assistant.

80
00:04:21,104 --> 00:04:23,174
Automation is not limited
to content delivery.

81
00:04:23,174 --> 00:04:24,764
It extends to governance as well.

82
00:04:25,034 --> 00:04:29,264
User data, track engagement, abandonment
metrics, detect friction points,

83
00:04:29,564 --> 00:04:33,284
training insights, identify popular
or missing topics, and the continuous

84
00:04:33,284 --> 00:04:37,304
optimization automatically curates and
promotes high value content in the loop.

85
00:04:37,874 --> 00:04:40,275
This governance loop
ensures sustainability

86
00:04:40,394 --> 00:04:41,864
without manual intervention.

87
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:46,775
The transformation delivered measurable,
ROI, which is $3.7 million in tangible

88
00:04:46,775 --> 00:04:51,695
gains has come from efficiency
improvement and using the metrics like

89
00:04:51,695 --> 00:04:53,314
we already covered in the previous slide.

90
00:04:53,814 --> 00:04:54,954
Here's how you can start.

91
00:04:55,014 --> 00:04:58,944
If you would like to have the similar
blueprint in your organization first

92
00:04:59,004 --> 00:05:02,664
designed for Observa observability
by instrumenting everything,

93
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:07,074
embrace the microservices,
modularize analytics components.

94
00:05:07,314 --> 00:05:11,874
Prioritize feedback by gathering real
time user insights, automate governance,

95
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,074
where you just let data manage
content cycles and measure everything.

96
00:05:16,164 --> 00:05:17,694
Everything means everything.

97
00:05:18,324 --> 00:05:20,514
By defining and monitoring
the success metrics.

98
00:05:21,014 --> 00:05:25,184
To summarize, evidence-based systems
powered by Kubernetes and analytics

99
00:05:25,184 --> 00:05:27,134
enhance the engagement and agility.

100
00:05:27,465 --> 00:05:31,184
Transitioning from static to dynamic
ecosystems unlocks the continuous

101
00:05:31,184 --> 00:05:35,594
improvement and real world implementation
delivered both measurable ROI and

102
00:05:35,594 --> 00:05:37,244
Tulsa transformation, as you saw.

103
00:05:37,784 --> 00:05:42,194
So the key takeaway is Kubernetes
when combined with embedded analytics,

104
00:05:42,434 --> 00:05:46,215
leads to resilience, scalable
human-centered knowledge system.

105
00:05:46,994 --> 00:05:49,184
Thanks all for joining here, and I'm.

106
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,380
I would love to hear your questions,
whether about implementation,

107
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,590
scaling analytics, or integrating
these ideas in your own environment.

108
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,550
Let's discuss and connect on LinkedIn
how these concepts can fit your

109
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,930
enterprise's unique challenges.

110
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,070
I'd love your feedback.
